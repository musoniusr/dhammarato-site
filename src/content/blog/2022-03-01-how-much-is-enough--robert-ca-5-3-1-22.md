### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Wow, all of a sudden the mic is making a lot of noise.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I apologize. Um, let me try and plug it out and then again. Is that faster?

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's good.

**Speaker B:** Perfect. Wonderful.

**Speaker A:** So anyway, Rob, it's good to see you again.

**Speaker B:** It's good to see you too.

**Speaker A:** And you have a question about satisfaction? Yes, Rod Stewart's question.

**Speaker B:** I don't get the reference.

**Speaker A:** Oh, you don't know him and his song Can't Get No Satisfaction?

**Speaker B:** Oh, the song? Oh yeah, I've heard the song.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** I didn't know it was his.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's the whole thing that we have, that's our life, can't get no satisfaction.

**Speaker B:** Story of my life right there, yeah, fair enough, good point. But so my question is, are there levels of satisfaction? Because I've heard you say that there's no like better and worse satisfaction, but I've also heard you say that Lots of people settle for second place, and I took that to mean second place satisfaction, not the best satisfaction that they can have.

**Speaker A:** Okay, except for one thing, and that is that if second place satisfaction is satisfaction, then calling it second place is a hindrance that prevents it from being first place satisfaction. Okay, then in fact you destroy dissatisfaction by saying that it's not good enough. You become dissatisfied with satisfaction.

**Speaker B:** That's a good point. I've heard you make that many times, and I've seen myself do that many times, but I've also found that certain satisfactions are more satisfying than other satisfactions. Satisfactions. So sometimes I feel satisfied.

**Speaker A:** Ah, but when you have that satisfaction, then you're satisfied with it. And then at another time when you have some satisfaction but it's not as good as that satisfaction, that means that you're not being satisfied with the satisfaction at the time. So that means it is actually not even satisfaction. The same thing happens with joy, that in fact are very deeply interrelated. And I used to use the word joy with the students more often, and they said, "Yes, I do have joy, but it's not enough joy." All right, always wanting more. Well, that wanting more and wanting more is that mind state that we have. That if good— if a little is good, then more is better, and a whole pile of it is wonderful. Yeah, actually, uh, good enough and wonderful are states of mind anyway. That's the— that's the point. In other words, if you can get yourself satisfied a little bit, then you have control over that satisfaction for a little bit. But if you have that same level of satisfaction and say, "No, I want it to increase, I want more satisfaction," now that's a hindrance that is actually keeping you from experiencing with satisfaction the satisfaction that you already have. The whole idea is to learn to be satisfied with a little bit of satisfaction.

**Speaker B:** I see, I see.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I'm starting more and more and more that you're already enlightened enough. You don't have to get any more enlightened. You're already enlightened. All you need, you're already there. That's what we're looking for, is that quality of nurturing. And the satisfaction that you get from nurturing is all the satisfaction and all the nurturing you need right now. Because we're actually developing a skill at it. There's a silly little example about that, okay? So we're practicing satisfaction itself, and yet the mind wants to practice to get the satisfaction better, which means we're not satisfied with this satisfaction. That's the point. So the story is, is that the student wants to learn to play the piano, buys a piano. He goes to the music store and buys a whole bunch of music books from beginners. He signs up for a lesson with the teacher, he has his first lesson with the teacher, and now he thinks that's good enough, and so he doesn't practice. Is he going to learn the piano if he doesn't practice the piano? Let's say he's off playing baseball or reading a book, right? No, he's got to actually practice the piano.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so you've got to actually practice satisfaction. You hear where I'm coming from? You got to practice satisfaction to get satisfaction. You can't say, oh well, I'm satisfied but I want more satisfaction, because now you're practicing being dissatisfied even with satisfaction.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, it's another type of practicing dissatisfaction. Yeah, all the same practice really, but in a new sneakier way. No, I follow.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right. So that's the way of practicing, is to be satisfied with the satisfaction that you have, knowing that the skill that you're developing is the skill of satisfaction. It is a skill to be developed, but you've got to practice that skill in order to develop it. You can't practice another skill like wanting satisfaction in order to develop satisfaction. There you're only developing the skill of wanting something you don't have. Yes, yes, yeah, subtly, softly. Yeah, very tricky.

**Speaker B:** It is, it is tricky because it's, it's it's very satisfying to practice wanting satisfaction and to succeed at it. So often I find myself affirming my success. Like you said, there's a great quote from you that I wrote down called the practice is repeated success, and I use that to just sort of say I'm succeeding, I'm succeeding, I'm succeeding, I'm succeeding. I conjure up those feelings, but while I'm doing that, I'm still practicing making the feeling better and better and better, and it's a very satisfying activity to do, but I can see that subtly that is different from just being okay with the satisfaction I've already created.

**Speaker A:** And in fact, it's probably a little more effort than you actually need.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, yes. It's definitely a more kind of motivated satisfaction. It has this quality of of striving, of putting forth effort, of engagement, as opposed to a quality of just relaxation and just enjoying the show. Yeah, like playing the game versus watching someone else play it, kind of would be how I distinguish that.

**Speaker A:** And so this is the point then that we can add that extra ingredient that comes from the Samma Sanghappa And that is the ingredient of eagerness or enthusiasm. Okay, that if you are eager, enthusiastic about the little bit of satisfaction that you have, then enthusiasm for a little bit of satisfaction helps it grow. Satisfaction really does grow when it takes less effort. And one of the ways of helping the effort that it takes is by, number one, trying to make it better, because that's extra effort. And number two, being enthusiastic with how wonderful and marvelous it is to have just a tiny bit of satisfaction. Just a little dab will do you. Hey, yeah, we've got a little bit going here. Okay, that's the way of looking at it, is that we gotta If in the old days when a car wouldn't start, we would push it off because it had gears and old batteries and that kind of stuff. Now that they've got electronic ignition systems and automatic transmissions, people don't push their cars off so much. They call a mechanic or something. Yeah, but in the old days we would push them off. It takes the most effort to get the car moving from 1 mile an hour to a half a mile an hour. Getting it to go from half a mile an hour to 1 mile an hour is easy enough. Getting it to go 2 miles an hour is easier, okay. But that first thing of getting it off the mark is where the energy is taken. And so the question is, can you learn to put your elbow into it for a very short time to get the thing going, and then you can relax and let it coast a bit.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it's like a little moment of right effort to just nudge the satisfaction vehicle moving again, and then I can just relax.

**Speaker A:** Just get it moving again, just get it rolling. And now we have the skill of satisfaction underway. Just enough effort. But see, what you're doing is that now you've got a little bit of satisfaction going, you're still pushing and pushing and pushing and pushing on that car.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yeah, I'm trying to sort of pump it up and increase a lot of the Piti, Sukkha. And I've noticed something as well, is in kind of noticing like there's different kinds of satisfaction, like I've noticed that there's a kind of very— the two main that I've noticed is, there's other variations, but the two main ones is a very peaceful satisfaction and then a very sort of overjoyed, excited, kind of, I think enthusiastic kind of satisfaction. And so I'm sort of imagining the first one is like lots of pity, and the second one is just like more just the Sukkha.

**Speaker A:** Yes, precisely. And when that melts into absolute satisfaction or peacefulness, that would then be called Upekkha.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Yes, excellent. Yes, and that, uh, that three sequence, by the way, is also, uh, referenced to or able to be put right in then to the qualities of the Jhana, so that the Piti is the second Jhana where you become overwhelmed with how good you feel, and then the third Jhana is the Sukkha of I'm no longer overwhelmed with how good I feel, but I still feel that good. And so that's a more relaxed state where it's comfortable and safe and secure, but it's not jumping up and down anymore. And then you could say, then you could talk about it in the sense of that the Piti is running and the Sukkha is stopping the running and just standing there relaxed. And then Upaya is laying down. So that's a way of looking at it this way. But the development starts with gladdening the mind to bring on the Sukkha. And the Sukkha, then with that over and over again, begins to bring on the Piti or the yeehaw of, wow, we've got this. We've got it. That's the quality of Samma Sanghappa, the wholesome thought of we can do this. It's got enthusiasm and eagerness built into it. You probably heard the expression— it may not be appropriate in all places, but here the expression would be, hold my beer. Have you ever heard that expression?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I have.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's the attitude. I'm going to go take care of this.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, hold my beer, watch this.

**Speaker A:** 'Hold my beer, I've got work to do right now, and I'm going to do it enthusiastically.' So that's the quality then that we're looking for to build that up, because once we have that 'hold my beer' quality, we can also see that is 'hold my thoughts,' because now I'm going to be really, really deeply engaged with this Piti, this the Sukkha, Piti, how good I feel. We don't have to talk ourselves into it or describe it anymore. We can just sit there and enjoy it directly as direct experience. So this is the direction that we're going, but we're not going to be able to get there if we can't get that satisfaction going so that we're satisfied, because it's that repetitive satisfaction that brings on that attitude of, hey, I can keep doing this, I could do this again. So Sukkha and then Dukkha, and then Sukkha and then Dukkha and then Sukkha, and every time we visit Sukkha, we say, hey, I've been here before. And then the Dukkha comes up and say, never mind, I'm back to Sukkha. And then we get the idea, I keep coming back to Sukkha. I could keep coming back to it, and that part, keep coming back to it, that's where the enthusiasm builds in, and that makes it then easier to throw that Dukkha out and come back, because you've got the enthusiasm knowing that we can throw this, uh, out.

**Speaker B:** And that, that confidence I found really key, because the more confident I am, the less effort I need, the less longer I need to apply, less long I need to apply the effort. I can just be like Oh, I remember I can do this. I remember that the practice is to feel good anyway. There we go, done, done deal. I'm back to satisfaction.

**Speaker A:** Fine. So now that we're talking about it that way, we're talking about it, uh, to answer your question, yes, there are various kinds of Sukkha, and that what we want is we want to have just a little bit to get it started. We gotta nurture the bump it to get it going, but once we do, it's going to be on a roll because now the effort is very little. We can keep pushing, and the better attitude that we have, the easier the pushing will keep the thing rolling for us. All right, now we're in the beginning, we're not going to be able to get that car pushed off to get it up to 100 miles an hour. That's not the intention. Never was the intention to get it going that fast, and yet that's exactly the way that a lot of meditators think they've got to practice meditation. Okay, but rather, no, we just need to get it rolling. Just get it rolling. That's all we need to do. Just enough, because then the momentum will build on its own. Yes, because So the skill development. So as we develop the skills, then that means that the pushing it off becomes easier and easier to do and get it rolling again without having to have an outcome or whatever. Just let me find some satisfaction to be satisfied right now, knowing that I can do this.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's like whatever we need to be satisfied with, it doesn't need to be big, it doesn't need to be lots of Piti. Or Piti. It just needs to be just anything small. The smaller the better, because the less effort we need to be satisfied by something that's very, very small, the less of a state change we need to create.

**Speaker A:** Yes, and that feeling of safe, feeling secure, feeling comfortable, and feeling satisfied— that's all there really is to it. Just a little bit of that. And so we can talk ourselves into feeling safe and secure the world by recognizing really there are no dangers right now. I mean, the photo of the eclipse behind you doesn't give you the idea that the place is going to blow up any moment now, so you're safe from that photo anyway. Okay, just recognize that everything is going to be okay. There's nothing really unsafe about it because our society has intentionally kept unsafe. That keeping people unsafe through propaganda, media, and in the schools, in the churches, is all designed to keep people unsatisfied. Because if they're satisfied, you can't make a profit off of them. For an example, if someone is satisfied and he doesn't want any new legislation, and he's also not terrified of those other people over there, I think he's got no reason to vote. And so, one party or another has got to either lie to him by telling him, "Look how much we'll give you," giving his greed, or, "Look how bad those other people are, they hurt you," which is the Republican ill-will side of things, and that's what you have with political parties. Both of them trying to manipulate you to get something out of you.

**Speaker B:** And they manipulate you by making you dissatisfied with the way things are. Like with companies selling you things, they create the need for the product. That's you being dissatisfied with the way you are now, so that you think you need the product to solve the dissatisfaction.

**Speaker A:** There was a star, his name was Popiel, and he was the one that started the the selling stuff on television, and it would always start out with how much drudgery people have in the kitchen. Oh, it's so difficult to chop with this knife, but if you buy my knife, now chopping is really easy, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But they all start off with how terrible life is without my product, and if you only had what I have to sell, then you would be better off.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's like these exaggerated extremes of the black and white. Mopping with a normal mop sucks, but mopping with our mop, it's like, wow, my life is perfect now, it's fixed. Until the new model comes out and then it's mopping with our old model sucks.

**Speaker A:** And Apple and Microsoft and General Motors all have to keep coming out with new models. They don't want people satisfied now with the model that they were satisfied with last year. When it was new. They want to keep you in a state of dissatisfaction so you keep buying.

**Speaker B:** I feel like it's kind of crazy, but like, we can't really like blame the companies because we do that to ourselves in our own minds.

**Speaker A:** Well, in my mind, I'm doing that to myself all the time. People who have your mindset that you're talking about here that run those companies And they know, yeah, that all my life is driven by greed and ill will. Maybe I can profit off of everybody else's greed and ill will. And so we lie to them for the profit motive, because the delusion that the CEOs have is the more money they have, the safer they are. Until they recognize when you've got too much money then you need to worry about keeping that money, because now you've got people trying to take you and your money, not just you. So life is not only safe without money, it's even more unsafe with money.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you've got more to lose. Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** You got more.

**Speaker B:** That's a fair point.

**Speaker A:** And so safety does not come from money. Nor does it come from the lack of money. The feeling of insecurity is a state of mind that we're just merely in the habit of having. And so the practice here is to come out of that state of mind of being dissatisfied because things are dangerous and bring on a state, at least a little bit, of satisfaction, so that I'm okay right now. Because if you are satisfied, you're unlikely to get up and go vote today. So when they want to increase voter turnout, the only way that they can increase voter turnout is not with wisdom, because the wisdom says why bother to vote for either one of them? They're all corrupt.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** But the question is, now you're going to vote for greed, or are you going to vote for ill will? Because those are the other two choices. Okay, now look at how many things you vote for throughout the day. I'm not talking about necessarily the polls and elections. I'm talking about our seal of approval. So we go around approving the things that we like, and we go around disapproving the things that we find dangerous.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So that's where the judgmental mind comes from. The judgmental mind is the critical mind of, oh, that may be dangerous, or, oh, I don't like that. And it's all based upon these ignorant feelings. If I like it, I like it, therefore it must be good. If I like it and it must be good, then I've got to have it. And if I don't like it, it must be bad. And if it's bad, I've got to destroy it. And so there's your battle between good and evil, and it's always inside the mind between the ears. And that battle is what we need to give up, that war inside, the war between the parent and the child, the war between the rules that we set and our inability to match up to our own standards.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, yes, yes. It's crazy. I've heard you say it so many times, but my mind always finds a way. I always find a way to co-opt each teaching, like Anicca's Anicca to be satisfied, to create my own problem. I need to be a certain type of satisfaction, you know, like maybe I'm satisfied with something.

**Speaker A:** Your microphone is garbled. No, it's got a gurgling sound to it. Take a screw out, turn it down. No, it's still got— it's, uh, distortion. Okay, I hear Both the microphones, when you unplugged it and you plugged it back in, both of them have a lot of background noise. And so I think that if you could turn down the volume of your microphone— I'll do that. Skype allows you to do that. Sorry, sorry, I got my hands a little bit more— Yeah, I do not understand I can't understand a word you're saying because it's so garbled. A lot of background. Is this not disgusting? No, it's exactly the way that it was. Very, very noisy. Now you've got it.

**Speaker B:** Oh, this is working now.

**Speaker A:** No, wait a minute.

**Speaker B:** I hear an echo.

**Speaker A:** It sounds good. Good. Speak to me.

**Speaker B:** Check, check. 1, 2.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that's good.

**Speaker B:** Okay, all right, one second. We're gonna do some last-minute studio rearrangements here.

**Speaker A:** I think you can do this in the sky.

**Speaker B:** I've been trying. I'm gonna try and switch the. Oh, no, I don't even have the. This is the wrong laptop for the. This is a bloody nightmare. You've got problem I'm looking for it. There's no microphone turning down setting. There's a speakers loudness setting.

**Speaker A:** The audio settings.

**Speaker B:** It says audio.

**Speaker A:** You scroll down.

**Speaker B:** You see audio and video settings. Yeah. I don't see a volume level for it.

**Speaker A:** You see a word, microphone.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah, there's no— I'm so sorry. I'm automatically— I've been manually changing it. I'm so sorry.

**Speaker A:** Please don't talk right yet because you're just blasting my ears. Okay, uh, does it say automatically adjust microphone settings?

**Speaker B:** I turned that off. I have it on now.

**Speaker A:** Okay, now you should be able to adjust the noise. Robert, I'm trying to step you through this.

**Speaker B:** I've switched the headphones I'm using, and I've set the noise cancellation to high. That's better.

**Speaker A:** Now that's worse for you. Okay, talk to me.

**Speaker B:** Check, check. Is this better, please? Please say it's better.

**Speaker A:** Your volume is high. That has always been the only problem, is the microphone volume is too high. How you set that is by go to the microphone settings and automatically adjust the microphone settings. Turn that off, and then the next bar down, it has a volume control, and set that maybe down to 5.

**Speaker B:** Is this better?

**Speaker A:** That's much better already.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Now I'm going to go back and set my microphone back to automatic. All right, now.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** I do apologize. I'm really sorry. Okay. I was panicking there.

**Speaker A:** I didn't want to hold you up because I need to record and everything. I know, but you were talking for so long and I didn't understand a word of it, and so I finally had to stop you.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, thank you.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so anyway, what were you saying before? And we'll start.

**Speaker B:** I have no idea. Let me remember.

**Speaker A:** Anyway, we were talking about satisfaction.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we were talking about satisfaction. Yes, I think where I was going with it was that, well, my next question at least was to ask, is the subtleness of the satisfaction a sign of progress? So you said quite clearly that how little satisfaction we can have, how little we need to be satisfied is a sign of progress, because the little satisfaction, less effort it needs, and the less like Piti you need to create to be satisfied, the less of this big kind of blast of energy to become satisfied with it. You can just be like, oh, I already know I can be satisfied satisfied with this, done, and then you're satisfied, and very little about your state actually changes. And so I just want to confirm that that's a sign of progress.

**Speaker A:** That's what we're talking about, is being able just to sustain that rather than having a thought, I can make it better. Because the thought, I can make it better, is the thought of a hindrance that just threw you out of it. Now you're dissatisfied. So the way to sustain it is to keep watching the mind in the sense of not allowing unwholesome thoughts that are negative, like this isn't good enough, or I want more, or any of that. And keep coming back to this is good enough. Wow, this is really nice. Those thoughts of dissatisfaction are, let us say, sneaky. They will keep coming back and coming back and coming back. And your job is only to see that and say, never mind, I'm okay already. I'm already okay. You're already good enough without having to compare one good enough with another good enough. That right now is good enough.

**Speaker B:** All right, all right.

**Speaker A:** See, nice. More and we keep wanting more and we keep wanting more. And because we wanting more, we destroy what we do have already.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, we kind of spoil it. Like, I can really see that. Like, at first I wasn't able to see that, but the more satisfied I get, like, the more kind of like the more sensitive I am, you can see it over and over again.

**Speaker A:** It's not necessarily a matter of more satisfaction, is that we could see it more clearly.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, I'm like sensitized to it, kind of. I'm like, I can kind of see like, like, like the, like the range, like, has— doesn't have to be as much to like see this satisfied, unsatisfied, you know, like things that I would before have thought as just satisfied, I can see like that's actually subtly like unsatisfying. Yeah, yeah. That's great, that's great.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's it. That's the whole idea, is that when we have a little bit, if we relish that and this is good enough, then we're practicing correctly. If we have a little but we want to get it to be bigger, we've just lost it, because now we want it to be bigger. We're not satisfied with it. And so, this is what we have to learn to do, is to get ourselves into that state and then sustain it. This is the real practice, is over and over and over again, sustaining it. Get it going, keep it rolling, keep it rolling. Keep taking another deep breath, keep relaxing, keep being satisfied, everything is all right, one moment at a time. That's the skills that we need to learn. Everything is okay. Keep repeating that. When a thought comes up, throw it out and come back to everything's okay, everything is fine. There'll be a lot of thoughts that this isn't good enough to come up. You can throw those out, come back and say, yes, it is. This is good enough right now. This is fine. I'm satisfied with this.

**Speaker B:** So I had another question, which is you've also mentioned that it's not about making consistent efforts so much as it's making the right consistent effort. It's the accuracy of the effort. Is there like, I suppose like I feel like this kind of pertains to that first like initial getting the initial elbow of the car to get it rolling. Is there a particular list of qualities of the satisfaction that we should keep in mind to make sure that it is a very accurate gladness? Like we're not gladness into a kind of messy, blurry satisfaction that's not that satisfying. We're gladness straight into the the satisfaction straight to Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** We could look at it with other words that have that quality in the sense of relief. It's a relief to not have to think about making things better. Okay, so, oh, that's right, I don't have to do anything.

**Speaker B:** That's a great point, that's a great point. I like that, especially like where I am now, having done a lot of the kind of like, I'm the best, I'm the best. I mean, not I'm the best, but like I'm winning at this, like having a lot of like these really joyful satisfactions. And I was saying before in the Sangha how it would lead to like some arrogance and to some like other hindrances and some conceit and some things.

**Speaker A:** So that's exactly like the Anicca, you get to car pushed off, all you need to do is just touch it occasionally to keep rolling. And you think, I've got to get it going faster and faster and faster and faster. Oh no, just keep it moving, just keep it moving, just touch it. Yeah, just keep it.

**Speaker B:** This is nice, I can be relieved.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, this is nice. Yeah, we got that car 1 mile an hour, that's all it needs right now. It's moving. Anagami. She said, and that way we can relax. We don't have to keep getting— making it better and better. Just get it good enough right now and being able to sustain that feeling of good enough right now.

**Speaker B:** And the rest, it does itself. We don't need to worry about it.

**Speaker A:** Those are the skills.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you'd be surprised at what skills do. I'm already surprised.

**Speaker A:** But you don't know. Right now we just need to develop that skill of applying the mind to the wholesome and then sustaining it over and over and over again to just the wholesome. Not something special, not wonderful, just good enough. This will do. Just a little dab, more dab, another breath, one more. And keep going like that, just one more easy breath at a time.

**Speaker B:** I like that, I like that. That's like a lot more chill than kind of what I was doing before. Less energy, it's more chill. It's just like, this is good enough, you know. It's like, there's another one I like, it's just like sometimes I say like, I'm already satisfied, even if I'm not. I'll just affirm that I already am, and then like it kind of like makes me already satisfied. I'm like, see, I already am satisfied. It's kind of like a weird— we try to trick ourselves.

**Speaker A:** We're sneaky that way. I'm not satisfied, but I'm going to pretend I'm satisfied, and then I'll be satisfied enough.

**Speaker B:** Like fake it till you make it. Yeah, that's kind of what I do.

**Speaker A:** All right, but that takes too much work.

**Speaker B:** That's true, that's true. It does, like, because there's like that resistance between like, no, I'm not, no, I'm not, no, I'm not. How— why are you saying that? Like, yeah, that can definitely happen, like, a lot.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so allow that to say, all right, well, I'm not up to that standard, but I'm not trying to meet your standard. I'm just relaxing right now, just enjoying this moment without having to be good enough for some magical standard that I've set.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, it doesn't have to be the right kind of session, doesn't it? I think it's just whatever's here, like, that's enough. The smallest unit of what I need, doesn't matter what I need, just I can use anything. It doesn't even need to be small, but I should— but I don't naturally want it to be small because it's less effort, it's more satisfying. So just anything, whatever works, just let's just be satisfied. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Samsara.

**Speaker A:** Just how long can we get just a little satisfaction and then maintain just a little satisfaction? Just enough. Yeah, I'm good enough.

**Speaker B:** It's crazy because my whole life, pretty much up until you, including all of my spiritual practice and meditating for like an hour a day, 2 hours a day, like it was always like always I was constantly either under stress and applying stress to myself. Doing effort, or I was like escaping and feeling like a victim and wanting to just like numb myself so I could like pretend my problems don't exist. It was like going between that, and now there's like this third option. It's really taking my mind a lot of time to get used to, and I'm practicing like all day. Like I'm trying to do it like all the time.

**Speaker A:** I really can see that also, and I have to congratulate you for it, Robert.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** I'm so happy so many of the students are beginning to figure out that it's okay to relax. That's all we need to do is just take a load off. Just relax. Everything's all right. Everything is fine. No worries. Nothing. It's not good enough, and it's okay.

**Speaker B:** It's all There's something I noticed you do a lot, which is like you like talk about like the words we use and how some words subtly like imply more stress and effort. And those words that I use would be watching the breath. And I started to notice like watching the breath kind of, for me at least, like just this was my personal like the way that word like meant stuff for me. It was like I have to be actively watching the breath. But then I started to use the word the breath. And so I just feel the breath, and it had this just like this really like comfortable, like peaceful, kind of fluffy connotations. And it was just like I started using that.

**Speaker A:** Those kind of words, uh, watch the breath rather than just experience how nice the breath is.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, enjoy the breath, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. To be able to clean out the sinuses and then just experience how beautifully open it feels inside the nostrils. That air really does.

**Speaker B:** It really does. I'm like, I'm becoming more sensitive to it. Like, like we, like we talked about, it's like just these, these tiny little— it's, that's so, it's such a small subtle thing. I totally have ignored it like a month ago, but now it's like just that clarity of having two clear sinuses is such a satisfying thing. Or it can be, it isn't always. Certainly when I need to get that first elbow at the Kamma, it can take a bit of work, but once I got some momentum to it, it's amazing just how small things can just expand to be like beautiful experiences, right?

**Speaker A:** But we have to have the seed. That seed of satisfaction will grow into an enormous forest, but not if you keep tearing the seed apart looking for the satisfaction or looking for the forest within the seed. It's not in the seed.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, looking for the satisfaction in the seed, that's so true, man. It's like a I had like an image in my mind of having like a cheese grater, and I'm just like, just like slicing that seed, not letting it grow, because I'm like, where's, where's the satisfaction? I need to, I need to find the one true satisfaction.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, good. You said it exactly right. All we have to do is just water and nourish the seed, and it will grow. It will grow. Just right now is just good enough. Right now is okay. And let that go. Keep going with it over and over and over again. Right now is okay. I can take a deep breath. I don't have to worry about making things better. Right now is okay.

**Speaker B:** I like this. I like this. This, this call has clarified a lot. My next question was going to be like, it's kind of being invalidated now by what we've talked about, but it was going to be, can you skip jhanas? Because I wanted to know if I could just like if my mind was like accurate enough, I could just pinpoint like Upekkha and just like go straight there. And I think it's not about like doing that now, it's just about like you said, what can I do to be satisfied now? Forget like becoming accurate, forget skill development, forget any of that, just right now just become satisfied. And that practice in itself, that's that, like that, that revealed the path, reveals itself. Like I just become satisfied now Eventually, like, whatever needs to happen will happen.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly. Because if you keep practicing it over and over again and sustain it over and over again, it will naturally grow. But you don't even care if it grows or not because you're already satisfied with what you've got now.

**Speaker B:** Exactly, exactly, exactly. That's it, that's it. It's crazy. It's such a, it's such a switch. It's such a switch. It's such a switch from what I'm, what my mind has been conditioned to be just used to, like all its life.

**Speaker A:** But it's, you know, this is great. I think that this is a good point now for us to finish. I think that you've got it. Yeah, so you just go and have that.

**Speaker B:** I'm kind of primed for practice. I always like, I always meditate after our calls. Like, they kind of prime me. I get into a really like focused kind of state, you know, just like kind of chill state, kind of vibey. Like, yeah, yeah, it's good.

**Speaker A:** Well, you go do that and we'll talk later. This has been a really good call. I think it's been excellent for you. So go play with it. Go have fun.

**Speaker B:** Brilliant. I'm going to just like focus on just that relief I'm feeling. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. Alrighty, we see you later.

**Speaker B:** Have an excellent evening.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, the core teaching from Dhammarato (Speaker A) to Robert (Speaker B) is about the **skill of cultivating and sustaining satisfaction (*sukha*)** and how the mind often sabotages it.

Here is a summary of the key points:

**1. The Central Paradox: Wanting More Satisfaction Destroys Satisfaction**
The primary obstacle is the mind's tendency to be dissatisfied with the level of satisfaction it has. If you have a little satisfaction but think, "This isn't enough; I want more," you've actually switched from practicing *satisfaction* to practicing *dissatisfaction*. This "wanting more" is a hindrance that prevents you from fully experiencing the satisfaction already present.

**2. Practice Satisfaction with What You Have**
The essential skill is to learn to be **"satisfied with a little bit of satisfaction."** The goal is not to achieve a huge, peak experience but to find and nurture a small, manageable feeling of "good enough," safety, or relief. The instruction is to repeatedly affirm: "This is good enough right now. I'm okay. Everything is fine."

**3. The Analogy of Pushing a Car**
Starting satisfaction is like pushing a car. The hardest part is the initial effort to get it rolling from a standstill. Once it's moving, it takes much less energy to keep it going. Similarly, you apply a short, focused "elbow grease" of right effort to establish a tiny bit of satisfaction (e.g., taking a deep breath, noticing a clear sinus, feeling safe). Then, you relax and sustain it with minimal effort, rather than constantly "pushing" to make it bigger and better.

**4. Progress is Measured by Subtlety and Sustainability**
Progress in this practice is **not** about achieving more intense bliss (*piti*). True progress is marked by:
*   Needing **less** to be satisfied.
*   The satisfaction becoming more **subtle**, peaceful, and relaxed (moving from excited *piti* to serene *sukha* to equanimous *upekkha*).
*   Increased **sensitivity** to the difference between true satisfaction and subtle dissatisfaction.
*   The ability to **sustain** a low-level satisfaction for longer periods.

**5. The Role of Enthusiasm (*Samma Sankappa*)**
The wholesome attitude needed is one of **eagerness and enthusiasm for the little bit you have**. Instead of judging it as "second place," you appreciate it: "Wow, it's wonderful to have even this tiny bit!" This enthusiastic attitude helps the satisfaction grow naturally with less striving.

**6. Social & Psychological Context**
The discussion connects this inner training to the outer world. Our consumerist society and political systems are designed to **cultivate perpetual dissatisfaction** (greed and ill-will) to motivate buying and voting. The practice is a direct rebellion against this conditioning, learning to find safety and sufficiency independent of external conditions.

**7. Practical Instructions**
*   **Use supportive language:** Instead of "watching the breath" (which can feel effortful), try "enjoying the breath" or "feeling the relief of the breath."
*   **Cultivate relief:** A key doorway is the feeling of **relief**—the recognition that "I don't have to do anything or make this better right now."
*   **Sustain, don't escalate:** The real practice is **repetitive success**. Get a little satisfaction, maintain it, lose it, and gently bring it back. The cycle of returning builds confidence and skill.
*   **Let it grow naturally:** Like nurturing a seed, you provide the conditions (sustained, gentle satisfaction) and allow the deeper states (*jhanas*) to develop on their own. You don't "skip" to them; they unfold from consistent, correct practice.

**Conclusion:** The talk guides the practitioner away from a goal-oriented, striving meditation toward a practice of **relaxed, repetitive nurturing of present-moment satisfaction**. The ultimate insight is that you are "already enlightened enough"; the path is about realizing and settling into that sufficiency through the skillful practice of contentment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors** and one extended **story** to explain the practice of satisfaction and the pitfalls of striving.

### **Metaphors:**

1.  **The Car Push-Start:** This is the central, extended metaphor.
    *   **Scenario:** Pushing an old car to get it started.
    *   **Meaning:** The initial effort to generate even a tiny bit of satisfaction is the hardest part (getting the car moving from 0 mph). Once you have a little momentum (a little satisfaction), it requires much less effort to sustain it (the car rolls more easily). The mistake is to keep pushing frantically (striving for more) when you could just let it coast.

2.  **The Seed:**
    *   **Scenario:** Nourishing a seed so it grows into a forest.
    *   **Meaning:** A small feeling of satisfaction is like a seed. If you nurture it (by being content with it), it will naturally grow. If you "tear the seed apart looking for the forest" (analyze it or try to force it to be bigger), you destroy it.

3.  **Playing the Piano (also a story):**
    *   **Scenario:** Practicing the piano.
    *   **Meaning:** Satisfaction is a skill that must be practiced directly. You can't practice "wanting to play the piano" (wanting more satisfaction) and expect to get better at playing (being satisfied). You have to practice the skill itself.

4.  **"Hold my beer":**
    *   **Scenario:** A colloquial expression of confident, enthusiastic action.
    *   **Meaning:** The wholesome, eager attitude (`Samma Sankappa`) needed to initiate the practice—a confident, "I can do this" mindset to apply the initial effort.

5.  **Running, Standing, Lying Down:**
    *   **Scenario:** Physical postures.
    *   **Meaning:** Used to describe the progression of meditative joy (`Piti`, `Sukkha`, `Upekkha`). `Piti` (rapture) is like running with excitement. `Sukkha` (bliss) is like standing still in comfort. `Upekkha` (equanimity) is like lying down in peaceful rest.

### **Stories/Narratives:**

1.  **The Piano Student Story:** This is a clear, illustrative story.
    *   **Plot:** A student wants to learn piano, buys the instrument and books, takes one lesson, but then doesn't practice, thinking that's enough.
    *   **Purpose:** To show that you must **practice satisfaction itself** to develop the skill. Intellectual understanding or initial setup is not enough. If you don't practice, you won't improve.

2.  **The Marketing/Advertising Narrative:** While not a single story, the speaker repeatedly references a common cultural narrative.
    *   **Plot:** Advertisements and political campaigns begin by exaggerating a problem or creating dissatisfaction ("Your life is hard without this product!" / "Those people are a threat!").
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate how our minds and society are conditioned to foster dissatisfaction. It shows that the habit of wanting "more" or "better" is externally reinforced and internally mimicked, making the practice of being satisfied with "enough" counter-cultural.

**Core Teaching Through Metaphor:** The collective point of these metaphors and stories is that **satisfaction is not a goal to be achieved, but a skill to be practiced in the present moment.** The hindrance is the mind's tendency to take a little satisfaction and immediately try to "improve" it, which is actually the act of becoming dissatisfied with what is. True progress is measured by needing *less* stimulation to feel satisfied and being able to sustain that feeling with minimal effort.
