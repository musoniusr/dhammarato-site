### Transcript


**Speaker A:** a point where they would be confused about not having a good time?

**Speaker B:** Uh, well, let's go with what we've got in front instead, and that is, is that the point that you're making is, is that when you begin to see how things actually— how great they actually are, or how ordinarily happy they are— that gives us a thrill. Okay, you're saying that's the point in time when magical starts?

**Speaker A:** Thoughts start up when you can diverge.

**Speaker B:** That's a better way of saying it.

**Speaker A:** Would you agree?

**Speaker B:** Well, what I would say is, is that we have, let us say, one peak experience rarely, and then we rarely repeat that peak experience. But then we get on a roll and begin to have more and more often, and there's the peak experiences now become ordinary. But the point in time when that peak experience happens and then you're no longer in that peak experience, you come out of it. That's when the magical thoughts happen of, oh, I want that back again. And that the magic is, is that this moment when I'm not at a peak is not okay, but only the peak moment is okay. And then in fact, the only way you could get into a peak moment was by having an ordinary moment okay. And it became more and more okay until it was a peak okay. But if it's not okay right now, that if you're wanting that peak experience, you can't have it because it has to have a base of being okay. The magical thought is, is that I am not okay and I need help. That's the only magical thought that has ever happened. I can't do it. Okay, here's an example of that.

**Speaker A:** It happens so far and a few in between. Like, if it happens, then you're just seeking that, and you're like, it's not this next breath. That's the miracle already.

**Speaker B:** That's, that's absolutely correct. I congratulate you for that one. That's good.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. I mean, When I first started talking to you, that's what I was seeking.

**Speaker B:** Uh-huh. Yes, I'm being honest with myself.

**Speaker A:** I wanted to show someone how far I've come, honestly.

**Speaker B:** Stand back and take a look and connect everything with the breath. Exactly. Connecting it all together. In fact, this is what the human mind is capable of doing. That's its only job that has ever had, the human part of the brain. There's other parts of the brain whose job is to keep that part of the brain running. And then there's other parts of the brain who keep giving that part of the brain information. But the human part of the brain is only the ability to see dots connecting together, to see connections. The aha moment when the mathematician is writing his math on the board and then he gets it. Yeah, okay, you can connect those dots. Those are the aha moments. And basically, as you're learning to connect the dots more and more, all your thoughts are aha moments, because everything is now connecting together.

**Speaker A:** When you talk to me about a person with their hair cut, practicing like their hair caught on fire, I

**Speaker B:** I

**Speaker A:** felt that like I need to teach people this because this is literally the difference between life and death.

**Speaker B:** Exactly so. This is one of the reasons why we actually are enthusiastic about spreading the Dhamma, teaching the Dhamma, is because people gain so much value out of it. And I get such a kick out of watching people gain great value out of it.

**Speaker A:** And you need to make sure your practice doesn't include people figuring that out.

**Speaker B:** Pardon?

**Speaker A:** You need to make sure your practice isn't dependent on people figuring that out. But that's your biggest desire, I bet.

**Speaker B:** No, I would say if I had my actual preferences, that I wouldn't even be doing these Skype calls. I would be perfectly happy to not. Answer a Skype call. But while I'm on the Skype call, boy, do I enjoy the heck out of them.

**Speaker A:** Oh, so you got that heart of service with you. I appreciate it because these calls have been very valuable to me, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's worth talking about. And so this whole idea of connecting things together, that's what we got started with because of the connection that you made between the boat that you got out of an heir or an estate the day before you called me. And I make that connection with the boat. But that happens on a regular basis. I think the strangest one was when a guy told me that he was a professional dishwasher. And I didn't know that, but here I am using dishwashing as being in the moment. And it blew him out.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely. And it's because by removing hindrances, wisdom naturally arises.

**Speaker B:** Mhm. And we can see things without understanding what we're actually Where that information comes from is irrelevant. The fact is that there it is.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so

**Speaker A:** can I go ahead? What drew you to pursue this particular practice versus all the other practices, or combining the myriad of practices I'm sure you experienced throughout your life.

**Speaker B:** Uh-huh.

**Speaker A:** Because each generation continues to have a wider range of traditions to draw from.

**Speaker B:** Well, there's going to be limits to that.

**Speaker A:** My generation is presented with the forest of ideas.

**Speaker B:** Right. Actually, on the internet, we are— Just

**Speaker A:** if I may, I came across you and Ajahn Sona YouTube channel around the same time, and he is actually a— he learned from Ajahn Chah.

**Speaker B:** Okay. So that— Now I know which Somi you're talking about.

**Speaker A:** Obviously, you guys are different teachers, but you're similar.

**Speaker B:** No, not at all. No, no. No, not at all. No, not at all. Ajahn Chah was a student of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. I met Ajahn Chah at Wat Suan Mokkh, home of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. And he had— You both learned from Bhikkhu Buddhadasa?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Let us say almost all of the Grand Masters all over the world consider Bhikkhuni their teacher. Including the Dalai Lama. So we're all in one big family. This is not this, that, and the other different teaching. Isoma just has a different way of saying what I say, and I congratulate him for his style.

**Speaker A:** I'm not saying listen to Ajahn Chah. I'm saying listen to— anyway, even deriving any sort of lineage or even thinking royals, doesn't that like give you some sort of like Now I'm just appealing to authority.

**Speaker B:** No, it gives me a feeling of comfort. It gives me a feeling of having come home. It gives me a feeling that the way that I can actually see when I do it correctly, the world, it is actually mapped out by former generations of people who really have taken a look at the way things are. And that we're in complete agreement. And that gives me great solace that I'm not stuck out there in the generation like you are, where you see all of this variety, where I've come to the state that I see all of the sameness.

**Speaker A:** True. But did you explore a variety? You must have explored a variety of ideas.

**Speaker B:** I have been around the corner. I spent 3 years in India.

**Speaker A:** I know, I know you did. I remember watching like your Guru Viking interview and stuff.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so magical. Yeah, something you already know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you're right. Yeah, I just like talking to you, you know.

**Speaker B:** I know, I love it too. Okay, so we can go for I've been there, done that with almost every one of them.

**Speaker A:** So you needed something to carry with you at all times, something you'd never be removed from?

**Speaker B:** The breath.

**Speaker A:** There's something more subtle than that, isn't there?

**Speaker B:** Uh, yes, but then we can go right through the Satipatthana.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so is your view that Any practice that isn't Anapanasati?

**Speaker B:** There is no practice. Well, let us say yes, that's getting closer to the point. Let me tell you this story. You've probably heard it before. It's a story the Buddha told. It's the story about 10 blind men on the same day, all touching an elephant. And each one of them touches a different area of the elephant, and then they come away and argue about— because one says the elephant is like a tree trunk, another elephant says no, it's like a giant fan, another one says no, it's like a big brush. Another one says, no, it's like a limb of a tree. I wonder what the guy who had his hands on the bull elephant's balls had to say. But they didn't put that. That would be number 11. But here's what exactly— that's exactly right. Okay. So in that regard, this is what Western Buddhism is. There's a whole lot of blind Westerners each one of them touching one tradition or one aspect of something and then think they've got the whole show.

**Speaker A:** Because if it doesn't deliver you in this moment, it won't deliver you 500 moments from now.

**Speaker B:** I'm sorry, what?

**Speaker A:** If it doesn't deliver you from this moment, it won't deliver you 500 moments from now.

**Speaker B:** Yes, okay, precisely. But, but if it does deliver you now, then 500 my moments from now, it may still be able to deliver you at that particular point. But if you can't do it now, what skills have you developed other than practicing doing that is going to give you the skill to do it in that time, 500 9 moments from now, right? So yes, everything comes back to this present moment. If you can do it now, you can do it in the next present moment. We don't have to worry about the next present moment because we know that this present moment we've got wired, and we can wire and we can handle it no matter what this present moment brings. But a lot of people spend a whole lot of time and thought moments in what about isms of what about could go wrong. So there's two ways to be prepared. One is to think of everything that can go wrong and fix it in advance. And the other one is recognize it doesn't matter what happens because nothing's broken and we're going to keep it that way. And so I don't have to go around having any problems to solve. I don't have to get ready for that, for danger. In other words, I stop looking for dangers. So I stopped the whataboutisms. Oh, the clearest example is OCD. Obsessive compulsive disorder is the guy who keeps thinking that my hands are dirty, so he keeps washing them over and over again until they get raw.

**Speaker A:** Totally. How about this one? How about this one for you? So if we live in a causal universe

**Speaker B:** You're the cause.

**Speaker A:** Satisfactory universe would be causal. You put in the causes, you get the effects, right?

**Speaker B:** Okay, I'm listening. Keep going. Are you going to be the cause or are you going to be the effect? That's your choice.

**Speaker A:** Because—

**Speaker B:** all right, well, most people don't. Most people start off as a victim. We were victim. We are all victims when we are little children.

**Speaker A:** Well, yeah, I mean, because everything that

**Speaker B:** happens happens to a baby, and if this— if nourishing doesn't happen to a baby, it will die. And so we're all afraid we're not going to get enough nourishment, and we keep those thoughts the rest of our lives, which means we are now looking for some love from the outside to come in and affect us. We're looking for a cause. Because we're the effect. But we have the possibility of changing that mentality around to where I own this universe, and everything that happens in it is because I cause it. And when we recognize that you cause everything that ever happens, you actually understand that you are God.

**Speaker A:** You're more powerful than you could ever imagine.

**Speaker B:** No, that's the whole problem, is we've been imagining power instead of just, uh, experiencing the power, right? Accepting it, that there it is. You're already that powerful.

**Speaker A:** And you can almost frame that as the delay of recognizing a moment is your physical organism has already done whatever it needs to exist here, right?

**Speaker B:** Taking a breath, that's all that needs to be done right now.

**Speaker A:** It's putting it right here, right now. Uh-huh.

**Speaker B:** Everything that ever needed to come together has come together right here. It is. It's all together now. And we can see that and relish it and marvel in it, or we can say, no, it's not good enough, it still is missing something. Our choice.

**Speaker A:** Most people will never recognize that though.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's almost like a very beautiful, delicious dinner comes to you from a restaurant. It's just not exactly what you ordered. Are you going to eat it and enjoy it, or are you going to send it back?

**Speaker A:** When you discovered that was the case though, why did you choose this teaching style? I guess because it exists forever, like this is the teaching style that exists.

**Speaker B:** I didn't know there was a style.

**Speaker A:** Don't you think it always kind of needs to be reframed, you know?

**Speaker B:** Pardon?

**Speaker A:** It always needs to be reframed in a certain sense or talked about in a different language.

**Speaker B:** I use a lot of Pali. I use some Thai.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I mean, is that the case though? It just continually— it's the eternal teaching. That's the Dharma, I guess.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, right. And in fact, the Dharma is quite small. There's really not much to it. And actually, when you finally— actually, there's nothing to it. They call that Sunyata. There's nothing to it. Piece of cake.

**Speaker A:** Because when you, when you see the Dharma, it becomes so evident you almost need to hide yourself from it, in a sense, to exist.

**Speaker B:** I don't understand, tell me more.

**Speaker A:** When you see the Dharma, it becomes like so overpowering. You see the reason for why you created that. Hello darkness, my old friend.

**Speaker B:** Oh, you heard that one, aha.

**Speaker A:** Well, yeah, I heard that from you, but it's the reason you create the reason to be, um, divided from yourself to discover yourself again.

**Speaker B:** In a sense, we're taught to do that as children. No, we're told to stop playing peekaboo.

**Speaker A:** We are, but that is what it is. You hide yourself from it because it becomes so evident.

**Speaker B:** You have to— I know the whole word. Listen to the word peek. You're seeing only the hands. The hands go away and you look. You can peek, you can see, and you're told to stop playing that game. Keep your hands up there and don't look at what's going on. Don't see for yourself. You follow the orders. You do what you're told to do. That's our society. And we become attached to that society. This is the word that the Buddha uses, Sila, Bhante, Paramasa. The rights, rules, rituals is how it's translated. But it's got a wider context, every rule. Okay, one of the rules that I learned was that I got to hurry up because I had to keep up with my dad, who was a fast walker. He's actually a meter reader. That's— I mean, he was a professional high-speed walker. And here I am writing a rule in my mind, I got to keep up with him. And why did I write that rule? Because he keeps saying, 'Come on, hurry up.' But he said that to everybody, but I heard it to me.

**Speaker A:** And to see through that is anatta. I mean, because

**Speaker B:** that was one of the rules I learned as a kid, and I carried that anxiety and hurry up with me into Wat Soi Mokkh, literally on the bicycle.

**Speaker A:** I gotta go.

**Speaker B:** When I got to Wat Soi Mokkh, I put the bicycle away and learned to relax, that I don't have to be in a hurry. There's no place to go anyway. I mean, here I was at Anicca's retreat center practicing really hard, sitting on the floor, sitting very still, going someplace, getting something done, in a hurry for it.

**Speaker A:** Was that a— sorry, I'm not very familiar with Goenka. Was that a more— it's got nothing

**Speaker B:** to do with Goenka. It's got to do with my mind.

**Speaker A:** So was it more focused on one-pointed concentration?

**Speaker B:** Actually, Goenka style is a body scan. Okay, and in that regard, you would say it's not one focus concentration, because one focus-pointed concentration requires one object that's not moving at all. Okay, so a candle gazer would be staring in that candle. If he had two candles, he doesn't use two candles back and forth between two candles. He looks at that candle. With the scanning meditation, you're moving all over the place. So that's what we mean by one-pointed concentration. And by the way, one-pointed concentration has nothing to do with Buddhism. I don't know wherever that came from.

**Speaker A:** Like I said, I like these videos. I just enjoy these. If you don't think it's helpful to teach with these videos, please don't feel necessary to post them.

**Speaker B:** I don't know why you're saying that. I mean, aren't you having fun right now?

**Speaker A:** I am having fun right now, for sure.

**Speaker B:** Okay, then that's it. That's the reason for having the videos, is so we can enjoy the moment.

**Speaker A:** Perfect. Because an object of meditation that's one-pointed would obviously become easily broken, is what I think. So you need like a meditation— Oh,

**Speaker B:** you mean because one-pointed concentration has a rule? There's a rule with one-pointed concentration. What is that one concentration rule? Is that it's broken when you change your focus to something else? You use the word broken yourself just now. Okay, why can't you just move from one object to another object without it having broken something?

**Speaker A:** Well, exactly. I mean, If you were to create a better system, it would never be broken.

**Speaker B:** Nothing ever is broken.

**Speaker A:** No, exactly. I totally agree with you. I'm just, you know, trying to— But everything

**Speaker B:** gets sick, gets old, and dies. Everything.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I agree.

**Speaker B:** And but that's a natural process. Broken.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, like, is when we don't like— crushing the kingdom. You have to like be okay with entropy.

**Speaker B:** That's all that we got.

**Speaker A:** But I mean, it's pretty beautiful. I mean, all things considered.

**Speaker B:** Well, yeah, entropy. In fact, you could say that gravity is an expression of entropy. And it's really marvelous to watch things fall, especially skydivers. They really like it.

**Speaker A:** Totally. What do you do when you're not taking Skype calls from people?

**Speaker B:** Nothing.

**Speaker A:** That's nice.

**Speaker B:** Nothing much. Nothing is important. Why should I want to do anything? Pet the dog, but I can do that while I'm on Skype. She's right here getting her ears scratched.

**Speaker A:** That's nice.

**Speaker B:** In fact, I just found a tick and I just removed it, and there it is. So there's nothing to do, no place to go. Any toy will do so long as you're playing. And when you break this toy, if you want to use the word break When this toy breaks, go play with another toy. Toyness is not broken. It's just that you decided that the state that this toy is in, you know, is unsatisfactory now, and that was your choice. Just because a doll has no arms or legs doesn't mean she's not worth playing with. The question is then the state of mind that we're in. Are we going to be in the state of mind being a victim, or are we going to be in the state of mind of being a winner who is in charge of our world? And then the next question would be, well, how do you go from one to the other? And then how do you begin to go often? And then how do you learn to remain there? And then how do you become comfortable and you just sit in the fact that there's nothing to do and no place to go and nothing really matters and everything is okay and you'll eat today and you'll eat tomorrow and you'll breathe now and breathe the next breath and everything's hunky-dory, everything's a piece of cake, life is good. And at the end of it, the end of life will be good.

**Speaker A:** Well, totally. I mean, when you talk about— you're right, it will all be good. It is all good. And by seeing it's all good, you can create the equanimity to see these weird, like, synchronicities of life. Because you're not so distracted.

**Speaker B:** Oh, it's a show.

**Speaker A:** It is totally a show.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, just enjoy the show. That's what life is. Life is just a marvelous grand dance or movie. In fact, in Hinduism, they call it Leela. Everything's dancing. Enjoy the show. Watch, for instance, the dance between Trump and Biden. Quite a show.

**Speaker A:** Well, yeah, that relates to the duality that we see that creates reality, you know.

**Speaker B:** Uh, when I just mentioned it, I mentioned them in duality by the names, but I'm talking about them dancing, and now there's unity again.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, the three out of the two, by seeing the middle ground, right?

**Speaker B:** By meeting in the middle, the middle path where everything meets together, like at the bottom of the cup. That's where all the stuff collects.

**Speaker A:** I really appreciate all these conversations you have, Dhammarato. I know I've mentioned that a couple times before, but really valuable.

**Speaker B:** Okay, practicing well, practicing correctly may be more valuable. That is, learning how to take an object and keeping it and holding it, and what that object would be ultimately would mean either this breath or this wholesome thought.

**Speaker A:** Transfiguring any negative thought into a positive thought.

**Speaker B:** That is one's right effort. The actual change, "I can change," has to be the attitude, and most people think they can't change. And they tell themselves things when they— when the mind wanders away from the breath instead of just returning to the breath and practicing. They say things like, oh, this meditation is hard. Oh, I can't do it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, another loop they get caught in that isn't I'm grateful for this moment. Mm-hmm.

**Speaker B:** The grateful thing— the mind has wandered away.

**Speaker A:** Hey, you can't do that? Oh, okay, here's these instructions how to be eternally grateful.

**Speaker B:** Why should we want to be eternally anyway? Anything?

**Speaker A:** Uh, yeah, that's true.

**Speaker B:** Why can't I just be grateful right now? Let me practice it right now,

**Speaker A:** right?

**Speaker B:** I bet I could be grateful next time too. Haha. But eternity, I haven't a clue, nor do I care.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's wild.

**Speaker B:** About actually the way that I would say it is that I only look a few days in advance, which would be like in playing chess about 5 or 10 moves in advance. Most people don't know how to look at a chessboard 5 or 10 moves in advance.

**Speaker A:** Sure.

**Speaker B:** So that's what we mean by putting together really what's going on, rather than worried about what will happen if I do this and what will worry, you know. And so we're always worried about what's my next step, because I got to choose the right next step. But Okay. And they almost always take the next step into the rat hole. Why is that? It's because they see that rat hole and they like it. And so they immediately turn towards it and then they take a step towards it and then a couple of more until they're in the rat hole. But if you think in advance and see things in advance, hey, I like that rat hole, but I better not step into it.

**Speaker A:** And that's what eventually moved you out of

**Speaker B:** Stepping into rat holes. Exactly. We begin to see them in advance. We see it in advance.

**Speaker A:** Such a hollow existence that you can't take it anymore. There's nothing there for you anymore, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there's nothing there for the you.

**Speaker A:** There's nothing.

**Speaker B:** There's nothing there for the you anymore. So let the you die and let the observer just have a ball. Just watch it, what's going on. Being alive, enjoying being alive, watching the show, enjoying everything. Wow, what a marvelous existence this is, this thing called life. The whole lot better than being a rock.

**Speaker A:** You're right. But you don't talk to people who are living in— or you talk to people who are living in the city, but you don't live in the city anymore.

**Speaker B:** No, some of my friends, uh, I've got one friend living on an island. I got another living in the desert.

**Speaker A:** Sounds like they're all pretty remote. I mean, that's why I'm in North

**Speaker B:** Dakota, but okay, so remote enough.

**Speaker A:** Every, every place is fine. I'm just saying, I think

**Speaker B:** this is

**Speaker A:** what happens eventually is it becomes a hollow existence and you start eating the

**Speaker B:** fruits of basically— No, it's a hollow existence is a negative thought. You just did that. You caused yourself.

**Speaker A:** You're right. You catch me every time, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** You— That's the joy of being sitting here is listening to what people say. And I come, aha, I see you. That's all my job. And that's the only job I've got. And many times students will not take the opportunity to let me say, aha, I see you, Mara. So I have to wait a while and then point it out later in our conversations. But that's the job here, is to point these thoughts out and say, maybe if I can see your unwholesome thoughts, you can too.

**Speaker A:** That's the point of the Buddhist teaching discussion with you. I mean, that's why I talked to you, like, because I think the correct way— observe yourself, observe the Dhamma, and then have yourself observed. Of like talk with the teacher. That's why every time I talk with you, I try and bring—

**Speaker B:** Or as that song says, have yourself a merry little moment, one by one they come.

**Speaker A:** Destroy that.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. Yeah, it's your choice. It's back to that, uh, original point that we were talking about, is yes, this universe is based in causality. Are you going to be the cause? Are you going to be the effect? Guess what? We try to be the effect. We've been taught that we're the effect. We were the cause all along. And so when the effect is Dukkha, guess what? We caused it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I believe it. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And how do we cause it? Greed, ill will, and delusion. Not looking at what we're doing, wanting things, seeing how beautiful that rat hole is and not seeing right through it down to the bottom of it. But once you've been down that rat hole several times, you begin to know the sequence. You could figure it out. So this time you see the rat hole and say, I'm not going there, I've been there, done that. But you got to wake up to watching yourself go down the rat hole so that now you can put it together.

**Speaker A:** When you say the rat hole, you almost seem like the chain of causality.

**Speaker B:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker A:** And then sometimes when I brought up, um, like, that's— you could actually say then that you is like walk up the stream back to where the first cause arises.

**Speaker B:** Right, which is exactly the point about the story of Adam and Eve. They got kicked out of the paradise, which meant that they went into bad feelings. How did they get kicked out of paradise? It's because they had to deal with the results, eating the fruit, and the fruit was bitter, and that destroyed paradise. And what was the fruit? It was the knowledge of good and evil. So if you go around saying this fruit tastes bad, it does taste bad. And now you've got no paradise left. But if you eat the fruit without judging the fruit, then you're nourished. It's paradise fruit. Stop judging it whether it's good or bad. So that's the teaching in the Bible, and that's absolutely Uh, not just a good Dharma. That's the only Dharma there is. That's it.

**Speaker A:** Sure.

**Speaker B:** Stop judging.

**Speaker A:** It almost kind of returns to that, like the story of the prodigal son. Mm-hmm. The guy who was given everything and he's like, no, no, no, this isn't it. I need to go find it for myself. Then he realizes, oh wait, no, it was always just right here.

**Speaker B:** Ah, but here's the point. He came back broke, penniless, dejected, a

**Speaker A:** failure, after trying to explore it for

**Speaker B:** himself, after he went out. But even though he came back broke, dejected, and a failure, which is where his brother saw him, his father still welcomed him home. The universe, after you go screw up your life, the universe will still welcome you home if you can see it, that you've arrived at home.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's almost like the paradise was

**Speaker B:** there all along, getting kicked out of paradise. Oh, you're talking about Angulimala. I was thinking more recently, but, uh, yes, that's exactly right. It doesn't matter what our past has done; when we turn around and repent, we recognize that what we were being chased by was a friend.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] It was the memory to do better.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Arhat] Ah, and the orders to do better, when in fact you're already good enough.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you're right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that is your friend, it's your daddy who's calling.

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker B:** Come home, come home. Here, sit down, have a rest. That's the practice of Anapanasati when it is a more complete package.

**Speaker A:** A complete circuit, maybe,

**Speaker B:** which has all of the aspects of the Eightfold Noble Path, to where most of the Buddhist practices have bits and pieces here and there, have it out of order, don't understand some of the language.

**Speaker A:** So that's basically— it's not broken down back into the Four Noble Truths, is that what you'd say? Because you need to return

**Speaker B:** Which is back actually that— because the first is

**Speaker A:** always there is a solution.

**Speaker B:** No, there is no solution.

**Speaker A:** The solution

**Speaker B:** is the Eight Noble— no, no, this— the Eightfold Noble Path is pointing out there was never a problem in the first place. You invented it.

**Speaker A:** Oh, okay. Okay, but if you get to number 4, you've already acknowledged there's a problem.

**Speaker B:** Uh, no, actually step 3 is giving up the problems. When you see that all of the problems are, uh, invented within one's own mind, we stop having them. We're in this, uh, third noble truth right then and there. And everybody spends a little bit of time in the Third Noble Truth, probably every day. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about it in the sense of— the name of the work is Nibbana for Everyone. Nibbana for Everyone. And in there, he points out that everyone has little Nibbana that they're not even aware of. Everybody takes an exhausting out-breath. People people sit down in the chair and say, oh, and not have any thoughts at all for 1 or 2 seconds, and then the old crap starts up again.

**Speaker A:** Sure.

**Speaker B:** And they're not even aware of that whole process. They're not looking at it, but they do relax.

**Speaker A:** That's because they never see the entire process.

**Speaker B:** They can't— they don't see the whole process. Exactly.

**Speaker A:** Long enough to see the whole cycle, and then you continually be lost in the cycle.

**Speaker B:** Uh-huh. So here many people are sitting in a meditation, possibly in a retreat, sitting down on the floor with no place to go and nothing to do for the next hour, and they still don't relax. They're working really hard. They're using the wrong effort when in fact there is a right effort. And in this case, the right effort is to stop the wrong effort. Yeah, that's the right effort, is to stop the wrong effort. Another way of saying it is the least amount of effort possible to get the job done, whatever it is, which would be in this case throwing that unwholesome thought out of the mind and putting wholesome thought in. That's all the effort it takes. That in the effort to take a deep breath, but that's all. I mean, the taking the breath actually is the easier part of the path.

**Speaker A:** The harder part is paying attention to the space in between breaths.

**Speaker B:** No, the harder part is taking the effort to actually see that that's an unwholesome thought and to throw it out. You and I have just gone through that sequence just now.

**Speaker A:** To pay attention to anything?

**Speaker B:** To pay attention to every thought that we have, because most of them are going to be unwholesome for a while. Or pay attention as best you can. And when do you pay attention? When you remember to pay attention, when you remember to look, when you remember to investigate. When you do find something that's not worth thinking, then you throw that out. Samatha, I have a thought that's worth thinking. And so what the skill that's developed is the skill in spotting unwholesome thoughts as unwholesome.

**Speaker A:** Yep, I'd agree with that.

**Speaker B:** That's the skill. And as we do that, that's also developing the skill of the First Noble Truth. This is Dukkha, the investigation of what is Dukkha, because if we can spot it, we can avoid it. You go right into the Third Noble Truth. All we have to do is see the Dukkha. Well, how do we see the Dukkha? That's the path. That's the Eightfold Noble Way, is to pay attention to what you're doing. Remember to pay attention to what you're doing. When you are paying attention to what you're doing, you're also judging it. Is this worth doing or not? And if it's not worth doing, we stop doing it. And that's all there is to the entire path of the Buddha. Almost like a light switch in the mind, and it's your choice to flip that light switch out of unwholesome into wholesome.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the light switch is when— would you say you're in the light switch itself? Degrees that the most efficient or the The best thing to do right now is to be present. That's all you have to do.

**Speaker B:** What is present? Well, presence actually means being in your senses rather than in your memory part of your thinking process. That the thoughts that you're having are thoughts about your senses as input is coming in, and you're not in the present moment when you take that stuff that comes in and try to evaluate it and make sense out of it. You're not in the present moment right there. You're here now. You're in you're trying to figure out what's going on, and how you do that is by bringing in the past. Clearly, you're several mind moments delayed. So we live a couple of mind moments after reality, and it's always a, let us say, clouded, darkened, or messed up image that we create.

**Speaker A:** Especially like an elongated mind moment would be like a trauma. Or something you continually remember, right?

**Speaker B:** We can, in fact, because we remember trauma, we will add trauma to any image that we have.

**Speaker A:** You like project it forward as well. I mean, that's the unwholesome way to do it. I'm saying it's right.

**Speaker B:** The wholesome thing to do is to wake up to that process so that we can put a stop to it. If we don't wake up to it, we can't see it. And if we can't see it, we can't catch it. And if we can't catch it, we can't grab it. And if we can't grab it, we can't throw it out. And that's the whole process, putting some skin in the game. Aha, I caught you is a really good way of expressing it.

**Speaker A:** Do you think the, the, the reason though, you, uh, it's like Have you ever tried to play chess against yourself?

**Speaker B:** Actually, I have seen that done, and I also recognize that secretly I have one or the other sides that I want to win. And another way of doing that would be like in a game that you're in, let us say a card game, that you're in the process of finishing the solitaire card game right at the end, and now you have a choice of who's going to be the last card that's going to be played. Is it going to be a red or a black? Who wins, red or black? And I set it up in advance, black's going to be the last card to play. And then I play the game so that red blows first and then the black. Okay. Yeah. Those are the kinds of things that people do when they're playing games. And if you're playing a chess game, then that's the kind of game that they're actually playing within their own mind of not just that I am going to win. Another one would be Sudoku. I know I'm going to win the Sudoku. What's going to be the last number? Am I going to wait until I— all of them? Or another way, can I play Sudoku so that I get all the ones first and then all the twos next and then all the threes next so that I do it in order? I'll play the game that way. OK, but always you're in control. You can either forget the order that they're in and just have fun, or you can actually set it up to make it hard by choosing which card, which numbers are going to get played in what order. That adds a level of sophistication, which means you got to keep track of a whole lot of stuff that you haven't put that 6 in that box yet, but you know the 6 belongs in that box.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I haven't found out a way to play chess against myself.

**Speaker B:** You can't do it. That's what I'm telling you. You can't. You can play these other little games instead. I'm using more simple games as the example. But in advance, you already know who's going to win this side, black or white.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** Almost by the choice of the opening that white is going to play determines whether the game is going to be won by one side or the other. And I've seen people do that, I've watched them do it. But that's just a side point. I mean, we do that in everything in our life. We play chess with ourselves, with everything. That when we're in a competition with another person, whether we win or lose that competition is based in our own mind upon the rules that we set for the game. And the people who wind up jealous already have the game set up that I'm jealous because he's the winner. And when we get wise to our own games like that, we stop playing them. I don't play chess with myself, and I don't compete with other people, because I know I'm going to win every time. I'm the one who sets the rules. And once you get tired of playing and winning every time, then you don't bother to play so much anymore. But when you do, it's massively fun.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] And that develops equanimity, you know, when you know you're not going to stop

**Speaker B:** Right, now you're willing to play the game because you know that you've won already. Before you begin playing the game, you know you've won.

**Speaker A:** And that develops a balanced mind state which becomes more and more beautiful.

**Speaker B:** This is what Anapanasati practice is all about. That's the reason that we practice that, is keep putting wholesome thoughts into the mind. Eventually, one of the thoughts, or actually one of the feeling systems that come into play, is that Samma Sanghappa, or right attitude, that I can handle anything, I win every game. What game am I playing right now? Taking a deep breath. I'm going to win that game. And so we developed that attitude of a winner. If you've developed that attitude when you're laying in bed and you don't want to get up, you can say, hey man, I don't have to get up. I can lay here all day. Nothing's going to happen anyway. There's no place to go and nothing to do. And then we'll say, oh wait a minute, I've got to get up again. Or we can have that game that most people play: "I don't want to get up." "You got to get up." "I don't want to get up." "Go ahead and get up. You got to get up. It's time to get up." You know that game?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's a good one. Well, not such a good one. A unified mind is definitely more enjoyable.

**Speaker B:** Yes, so that's the practice of getting the mind unified. And then that's all there was to do, is just get the mind unified. After that, there's nothing left. You're already there. In the suttas, they talk about it as pure as a polished shell. The job that needed to be done has been done. And when we begin to look at life like that, that any job that needed to be done has already been done. And what is the only job that we have to do is to unhook the unwholesome thoughts and plug a wholesome thought in. That's the only job there is. Another way to say it is whatever job, whatever work you have, the only job that you have when you get there is to be friends with everybody that's there. If you're the best friend of everybody that's there, you got no other job to do. Everything else that you're actually doing with your hands, let us say putting Widget A into Widget B, that's just part of the activity of being friends with everybody. But in fact, let us set this situation up, and that is that the employee who is the actual best friend, not just buttering them up, but is the actual best friend of the boss, is not going to get fired no matter how unproductive he is.

**Speaker A:** Yeah,

**Speaker B:** friendship is everything. The work, nothing. Well, let us show you, the work's just a piece of cake when you're eating a cake.

**Speaker A:** You've got it.

**Speaker B:** That's all there is to it. This is the teaching of the Buddha. This is the teaching of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. This is the teaching of all the old masters, but they have individual ways of saying it. And what Western Buddhism is, is trying to make sense out of all those various things that people have said when they're all talking about the same thing.

**Speaker A:** That's every language in communication, though, is there's always a a little bit of loss of translation.

**Speaker B:** Oh, the entire Dharma has been lost in the translation. I am eternally grateful for the— I use the word eternally with a big grin on my face— for the Thai translations of the sutras, because the English translations are not up to scratch. But the Pali itself is delicious.

**Speaker A:** It's also more accessible than it's ever been.

**Speaker B:** Not yet, as long as it's translated.

**Speaker A:** It's always successfully translated.

**Speaker B:** Pardon?

**Speaker A:** It's always successfully translated for those who can like hear it, you know.

**Speaker B:** I couldn't.

**Speaker A:** You found it.

**Speaker B:** Bhikkhu Buddhadasa rubbed my face in it until I couldn't ignore it, and then I started to pay attention to it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but how many people, like, that you think you graduate college with ever even explored this?

**Speaker B:** You know, I'm not worried about them, but if one of them calls, I'll have a ball.

**Speaker A:** Maybe I better be wild, but I'm just saying, like, the forest of ideas grows. It like always hides it, but it grows, you know.

**Speaker B:** Sorry, what is it that grows?

**Speaker A:** If there's a solution to this, it's always

**Speaker B:** What's the problem?

**Speaker A:** What?

**Speaker B:** What's the problem?

**Speaker A:** Oh, there's no problem.

**Speaker B:** Well then, what's the solution got to do with nothing?

**Speaker A:** Perfect solution.

**Speaker B:** The perfect solution is there's no problem.

**Speaker A:** There it is.

**Speaker B:** That's the only solution that actually works, is to figure out that there's no problem.

**Speaker A:** Yeah,

**Speaker B:** for instance, if the car won't start, you think that that's the problem, and so you look for a solution like getting a battery charger or whatnot.

**Speaker A:** Like that, the car to start.

**Speaker B:** Ah, that's the problem, is I want the car to start. And if I don't care whether the car starts or not, I got no problem.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the first level of truth. You have a desire for the car to start.

**Speaker B:** Right, exactly. And most people don't see that. Now, the duty to the Dhamma is seeing that, oh, that I want the car to start, therefore I can consider, is it actually better for the car to start? And if it is, then I can do my duty to go do what needs to be done to get the car started. Happily. But when we see that the car won't start is a problem, we are already unhappy before we even started to repair the car. But always the problem is in the mind, not in the car. Car starts or not starts, that's not a problem. Cars get old.

**Speaker A:** Sure.

**Speaker B:** I mean, if cars did start every time, Detroit, General Motors, and Ford would have big problems. They couldn't sell any more cars because the ones they built work.

**Speaker A:** Planned obsolescence.

**Speaker B:** Uh-huh, right. Guess what? Obsolescence don't need no plans. Everything's going to get obsolete anyway. Moore's Law is going to make sure that happens. It's not just computers that get strange every 18 months; the whole world gets turned upside down within 2 years. Everything is different, except our belief that nothing is different, because we've got concepts: this is how things should be. This is how things are. An example of that is medical science now has enough good medicines that most sexual items are now medical issues: abortions, premature births, birth control pills, medications for STDs. IUDs, that whole show has all been taken care of by medicine. Before medicine had any cures, which is as recent ago as the 1950s when penicillin was invented, before that STDs was not a medical issue because medical couldn't solve the problem. It became a moral issue. Instead. So, when medicine takes over its job of handling sexual dysfunctions completely, then sexuality will no longer be a moral issue. But you can see the strangeness of morality when you bring morality into sexuality. I mean, look at how the Christians hate gays, etc. Look how they could try to control women's bodies by saying you can't have an abortion. They used to say you can't have a divorce, too.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** So, we're talking about this Sila, Bhavana, Paramita is actually the whole culture that we have, and I'm showing you an example of how reality is encroaching upon the rules. And so a lot of young people are much more interested in going to a website to find out about medications and possibilities, birth control pills, etc., all kinds. They go to the websites. 50 years ago, they went to the priest.

**Speaker A:** Are you saying it's moving away from a moral thing and more to a medical?

**Speaker B:** I'm saying that it never belonged as a moral issue in the first place.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, true.

**Speaker B:** But it had to become a moral issue because we did not have a solution to people's problems medically. It became a moral issue because people could see the problems. When in fact there never was a problem. Infants die in the wild, couples do things, I mean, they know for sure, the birdwatchers know for sure that birds are not monogamous, even though the turtledoves and the Christian is all about two birds in love for the rest of their life, two wings of a bird and all that kind of crap, to where in fact, in the bird world, it's quite a lot of bedlam. Also, here's another example: If you have a big monkey tribe, never mind the variety of monkeys, from gorillas to lemurs, whatever, you've got a big tribe, let us say 15 or 20. When the bull monkey, the alpha, the one who everybody collects around, the guy who's got so much ego that he thinks he owns the place, when he's there in front of all the tribe, how much sexual hanky-panky do you think is going to go on inside that tribe? None. Because he's going to be very unhappy if the young men come to any of the women. Right, because he thinks he owns it. But now what happens when that big male monkey goes on a hunt, or is off away from the tribe? Let us say all the fully adult male monkeys are all doing something. What are all of the female monkeys and the young male monkeys doing? They're having hanky-panky. They're doing it. I mean, the researchers have been watching this, and they've learned all about it. But humans don't like that because we've got rules here. Well, the monkeys have rules too. When the cat's away, the mice will play. That's the rule that they have. And so in our culture, we have a big, big cat, cat in the sky, cat watching everybody. You got to behave yourself here. I mean, didn't that be the story for how many centuries now?

**Speaker A:** That someone's going to get you,

**Speaker B:** right? If you screw up, we're coming after you. That's the whole thing. You got to play by our rules. If you don't play by our rules, we're coming after you. That is actually the Buddha's ordinary right view. The ordinary right view is that we're going to stop the criminals from doing everything that the criminals are doing. And the criminals' wrong view is, "I can get away with it." And every human being goes back and forth inside their mind, the adult and the child— excuse me, the parent and the child. The parent says, "You can't get away with it." And the child says, I can get away with it. And the parent says, no, you can't. Here's another version of that dialogue. Somebody's watching YouTube and they have the thought, you ought to be meditating. And then the child says, no, I don't want to meditate, I want to watch the movie. And then the thought is, no, you ought to be meditating, you're not going to learn anything if you don't meditate.

**Speaker A:** But that's immediately replacing the wrong thought with the right thought.

**Speaker B:** Like, no, it's immediately— Paul's saying a wrong thought with another wrong thought. It is immediately replacing one wrong thought with another wrong thought. An argument, a dialogue within one's mind. Do I, don't I?

**Speaker A:** No dialogue. It'd be silence. It'd be— this is the right thing to be doing.

**Speaker B:** Oh, actually, a way of saying it then, in that particular example, is, is when the thought comes, you ought to be meditating, the answer to that is I am meditating. That's it. Yeah, do it right there.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I'll be right back in 3 minutes. I've got to use the restroom. Dhammarato, you feel free to pause it.

**Speaker B:** I don't know how.

**Speaker A:** Well, I'll be right back in 2 or 3 minutes. I'm back.

**Speaker B:** I know.

**Speaker A:** I feel like what you're talking about just relates to like a mental idea most people have about how they think the world should work versus just connecting with their emotions. Or who the ultimate teacher is. Like, you could tell me everything I'm doing is wrong. Like, you right here tell me, Gavin, everything you tell me is wrong. But I'd still just think, okay, well, I'm right because this is the way I feel.

**Speaker B:** I would say that that thought sequence is probably one of the most common thought sequences in American culture.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And it starts with the unwholesome thought, "You may think I'm wrong, but I'm right." That is an unwholesome thought, "You may think I'm wrong." When we see those thoughts, "Maybe somebody is judging me," that's actually a whataboutism. "What if the whole world thinks I'm wrong?" Why are you having that kind of thought?

**Speaker A:** Because the way— You were raised, of course. —things should be is actually much different than the way things are.

**Speaker B:** Right, we're supposed to improve the place.

**Speaker A:** It's not good enough, Dhammarato, because that's why I'm talking to you. I mean, but you don't think the mo— you don't think in the way that is very common in the world,

**Speaker B:** or nobility is not well understood at all in the West. It's much more common in Asia. That in fact, of Westerners, they don't like the Asian mind.

**Speaker A:** Well, they don't even teach that as an option, to be honest.

**Speaker B:** I'm sorry, what?

**Speaker A:** Well, Eastern thought is still relatively new to the Western mind in the grand scheme of things, I'd say. It's only recently been increased flow.

**Speaker B:** Only responding to what you said, that you're pointing out that I'm strange, and I'm saying, "No, I'm really ordinary. I'm the one that's ordinary here." And part of that has to do with the fact that everybody in the West is taught that they, particularly that particular 'you,' is special. We do that in kindergarten and grade school.

**Speaker A:** Yes, you're building up the ego.

**Speaker B:** Well, they think that they're building up self-confidence. But what they're actually doing, in a way, is building up competition. Ego, I'm big on. I'm one of the most egotistical people you'll ever meet. I like it in the sense that the way that Freud talked about it, his ego, his adult mental state. But in fact, most people are in id or superego. Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on. Therefore, you could go so far as to say that when people in the West are talking about egoism, they should be talking about idism. Because when most people think of the word ego, they're thinking about the id instead. Egotistical is actually something out of the id. So when you use the word ego correctly and know that you're using it correctly, then being egotistical is the best way to go. Just a matter of definition of the words.

**Speaker A:** So just to refine those definitions you're using, because I'm not super familiar with Freud, are you saying ego is the person in the audience?

**Speaker B:** Eric Byrne translates Freud into the adult ego state, superego is the parent, and the id is the child ego state. In neuroscience, we talk about the reptilian brain, the back part of the brain, the temporal and mammalian cortex of the brain, and the frontal cortex of the brain, that part of the brain that monkeys don't have. But even though we've got a human,

**Speaker A:** you know, spearing the serpent. No, the Archangel Michelangelo spearing the serpent.

**Speaker B:** I don't know what you're talking about. Sorry, you're saying that Michelangelo had— there's some piece of artwork someplace show him riding a dragon? Most people show him wearing wings instead rather than riding a dragon.

**Speaker A:** No, not riding the dragon, spearing the dragon or slaying.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, in that case, this— the dragon that is to be slain, uh, is the emotions.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Michael, killing the dragon. I've thought about that as the idea of, you know, like the frontal cortex slaying like your reptile brain.

**Speaker B:** Okay, the problem is with the ancient kind of words slaying, a better kind of way of thinking of it is that the frontal cortex actually becomes active often enough to ride herd on the reptilian brain, rather than letting the reptilian brain run loose. Or a better way even than that is to think of them as friends and cooperate mutually together and become more integrated. But they can only integrate once they become friends, and so long as there is a war and a slaying going on, there's not going to be much cooperation. Operation within or without. If we're inside competing over the Gabriel in our mind slaying the dragon in our mind, that means that we're going to be out there being Gabriel trying to slay all the dragons in the world, the Don Quixote.

**Speaker A:** Sure, yeah. And it's just accentuating the polarity versus finding that, hello darkness, my old friend, you know, we're friends here. Or I'm the person playing chess against myself.

**Speaker B:** I'm playing chess with myself. That's why I enjoy it.

**Speaker A:** I mean, yeah, I mean, I feel like a game is a pretty consistent, enjoyable thing you can do.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, now that we know that everything about life is merely a game, we can begin to enjoy the game because we're setting the rules, if we will set the rules, rather than just using the old rules that we had learned and had put into place. So there's more than just the dragon that needs to be slain, if you want to use the word slain. The Gabriels also got to slay the mother of the dragon, the one who sent that dragon out to fight Gabriel. Because if you slay that dragon, the mother's going to send out yet another son that Gabriel's got to slay again.

**Speaker A:** Sure, almost like the head of a hydra. Chop off one, two emerge.

**Speaker B:** That's the whole point. Now, so it's not just the reptilian brain that the, uh, that the frontal cortex has to subdue. It's also got to subdue the parent. Of the dragon. Who is the parent? The rule maker, the one who tells— who sends the dragon out. And where does— and why does the dragon go out? It's because the dragon's got a set of rules that he's got to follow, that he's reluctant to follow, and he doesn't want to follow those rules. So the dragon gets angry. But he's still a dumb animal, which is the whole point of the Buddha, is that dragon that we become is still a dumb animal, a draft animal doing what we're told to do and resenting it. That's the woeful state of being an animal. You heard about the four woeful states of where you can be reborn. Well, being reborn on a dumb animal or being reborn that Anagami dragon in this case is a common occurrence, so that when Gabriel comes out, it's me that gets killed.

**Speaker A:** Sure thing.

**Speaker B:** And go ahead.

**Speaker A:** Nope. And,

**Speaker B:** uh, and that goes for all of the woeful states. When we go into hell in our own mind, we open the door to hell and pump the air and made it hot.

**Speaker A:** You're just a— well, you're just assuming the state of the victim.

**Speaker B:** Uh, well, which are you going to apply the side of? Because in fact, you are all three of them. You are the victim, the persecutor, and the one who sees The show, the three-in-one. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spook. The Holy Spook is watching the show while the Father's beating the hell out of the Son, sending him on to the cross and all that kind of shenanigans, right? When's the Spook going to take his own power and tell the old man to shut his face? Help the kid off the cross. Huh?

**Speaker A:** You sound like a Gnostic.

**Speaker B:** No, I'm just playing with the word 3.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly,

**Speaker B:** just playing with the number 3 because everything in this regard happens in threes: greed, ill will, and delusion. The greed is the parent, the ill will is the kid, and the delusion is the adult.

**Speaker A:** The difference between them, huh?

**Speaker B:** And when the adult wakes up and is not seeing the ignorance, he can see the persecution of the greed and the dissatisfaction of not getting what one's wanting. We begin to put a stop to that. Freeway greed, ill will, delusion cycle that we're in. People, easy peasy, just wake up and look at what you're doing. That's all it takes.

**Speaker A:** Boom, that's all it takes.

**Speaker B:** That's all it takes. Easy peasy, it's easy. To take the effort to wake up, look at what you're doing, and make a change.

**Speaker A:** That's the super mundane.

**Speaker B:** That's the super mundane, exactly. Spelled right out in the sutras, number 117.

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato, thanks for the conversation tonight.

**Speaker B:** Oh, it's delightful. This has been delightful. I'm really glad that you called. Let us hope that you're getting good practice going so that you can really see these unwholesome thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I will say my practice lately is almost entirely focused on 24/7 practice, let's say.

**Speaker B:** Let's not be too focused on anything other than this present moment.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay. Do you recommend any dedicated breath practice focus?

**Speaker B:** No, no. Rather, when you understand that Sati is a skill to be developed, by practicing it over and over again, knowing that you will practice it over and over again. And as you wake up over and over and over again, when you wake up, you congratulate yourself for waking up right now. If you put a rule in there 24/7, then when you wake up, you'll wake up to rule-breaking.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there's two sides to that coin. Yeah, you're right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. But if you wake up to this present moment, wow, this present moment is wonderful.

**Speaker A:** So you want to— people would call it Anapanasati, like time on the cushion.

**Speaker B:** Sorry, what?

**Speaker A:** As people would call time on the cushion, or like dedicated, like eyes closed.

**Speaker B:** I would rather they enjoy the time they're spending on the cushion. Rather than dedicated to getting something they don't have. Enjoy what they have.

**Speaker A:** There's nothing they don't have.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Dedication is dedicating to get something that you don't have. It's almost like devotion to a higher being, like a parent ego state. Okay. We would prefer to use the word enthusiastic or eager. Dedication, don't need it. Dedication is almost always done in a ceremony anyway, and it's got a long time frame involved with it. Dedicated your life to Jesus, a life of poverty, A vow of celibacy. I know all about that stuff. The Buddha calls all of that ordinary things for ordinary people to do. Sure, but enthusiasm, that's something you can do right now. Let's do it with gusto right now. Boom! You got it.

**Speaker A:** Got it. Thank you so much for the call tonight.

**Speaker B:** Excellent.

**Speaker A:** I enjoyed the rest of your day.

**Speaker B:** Oh, this is just— and I wish you this present moment that you get a big kick out of it. This present moment is good enough.

**Speaker A:** You got it. This one's going out to you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** Excellent. We'll see you later.

**Speaker A:** We'll catch you later.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, a conversation between Dhammarato (Speaker B) and a student (Speaker A), revolves around core Buddhist principles, emphasizing practical insight over abstract philosophy. Here is a summary of the key themes:

### Core Themes of the Talk

**1. The "Magical Thought" of Discontent:** The discussion begins by examining how the mind creates suffering. When we have a "peak" happy experience, the mind then creates the "magical thought" that the present, ordinary moment is *not okay* and that we need to recapture that peak. True peace comes from seeing that **this present moment is already okay and sufficient**. Happiness grows from a base of accepting the ordinary, not by chasing peaks.

**2. The Breath as the Anchor and Path:** The practice centers on **Ānāpānasati** (mindfulness of breathing). The breath is always available as an object of mindfulness and a tool to unify the mind. The goal isn't forced one-pointed concentration but using the breath to connect with the present and develop wholesome mental states.

**3. You Are the Cause, Not the Effect:** A major shift in perspective is moving from being a **victim** of circumstances (the *effect*) to recognizing you are the **cause** of your experience. Suffering (Dukkha) is caused by our reactions—greed, ill will, and delusion. By taking responsibility for our thoughts, we reclaim our power and peace.

**4. Spotting and Replacing Unwholesome Thoughts:** The essential skill of the path is **mindfulness (Sati)**—paying enough attention to catch unwholesome thoughts (e.g., "I can't do this," "This isn't good enough," "I want that back") as they arise. The "right effort" is simply to discard that thought and replace it with a wholesome one (e.g., gratitude, "I can handle this," "This breath is enough").

**5. Life as a Game to be Enjoyed:** When you realize you set the mental rules, life becomes a game to be enjoyed, not a problem to be solved. The attitude shifts from striving and judging to **observing and enjoying the "show."** Equanimity comes from knowing you've already "won" by choosing to be present and wholesome.

**6. The Simplicity and Universality of the Dharma:** Dhammarato stresses that the true Dharma is simple and universal. He traces his lineage to Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, suggesting that many great teachers (Ajahn Chah, the Dalai Lama) point to the same essential truths. Western Buddhism often gets lost in the "forest of ideas," touching parts of the tradition (like blind men touching an elephant) without seeing the integrated whole, which is always available **here and now**.

**7. There is No Problem to Solve:** The ultimate "solution" is realizing **there was never a real problem** outside of our own mental labeling. A car not starting is only a problem if we are attached to it starting. Letting go of that desire removes the suffering, allowing us to address the situation with clarity and ease if needed.

### Key Takeaways for Practice
*   **Focus on the present moment:** It is always the point of practice.
*   **Catch unwholesome thoughts:** This is the primary skill. Replace them with gratitude or a focus on the breath.
*   **Drop the rules and dedication:** Practice with **enthusiasm and enjoyment**, not as a grim duty or a 24/7 rule that sets you up for self-judgment.
*   **You are the cause:** Shift from a victim mentality to an empowered one.
*   **Connect the dots:** The mind's job is to see connections. As practice deepens, you see the interconnectedness of experience and the patterns of your own mind.

In essence, the talk is a guide to **deconstructing self-created suffering through immediate, present-moment awareness and taking joyful responsibility for one's own mind.** The path is framed not as a distant goal but as a series of choices available in every breath.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this dialogue, the primary metaphors and stories used are:

**1.  The "Rat Hole" / "Rat Hole of Causality"**
*   **What it is:** A metaphor for unwholesome thought patterns or behaviors (driven by greed, ill will, delusion) that lead to suffering (dukkha).
*   **How it's used:** Speaker B describes how people see an appealing but ultimately negative pattern ("the rat hole"), choose to step into it, and get stuck. The goal of practice is to see these patterns in advance ("see the rat hole") and, having learned from past experience, choose not to enter. It represents the chain of unskillful causality.

**2.  The Elephant and the Blind Men**
*   **What it is:** A classic Buddhist story (from the Udāna) cited by Speaker B.
*   **How it's used:** To critique "Western Buddhism." Each blind man touches a different part of an elephant (trunk, leg, side) and argues about what the elephant is like. Similarly, Speaker B suggests that practitioners who focus on only one tradition or technique mistake their partial experience for the whole of the Dharma.

**3.  The Prodigal Son**
*   **What it is:** A Biblical parable referenced by Speaker A.
*   **How it's used:** To illustrate the theme of "returning home." The son leaves, squanders everything, and returns in failure, yet is still welcomed by his father. Speaker B connects this to the idea that no matter one's past mistakes, the "universe" (or one's true nature) is always welcoming if one can recognize they are already "home" (i.e., in a state of acceptance/okayness).

**4.  The "Toy"**
*   **What it is:** A simple metaphor for experiences, circumstances, and even the body.
*   **How it's used:** Speaker B says, "Any toy will do so long as you're playing." The point is that the value isn't in the toy's condition (a doll with no arms) but in the state of mind of the player. When one "toy" (e.g., a health state, a life situation) wears out or "breaks," you move to another without lamenting, maintaining a mind of play and non-attachment.

**5.  Chess / Games Against Oneself**
*   **What it is:** A metaphor for internal conflict and the illusion of duality.
*   **How it's used:** Speaker B argues you can't truly play chess against yourself because you always secretly favor one side. This illustrates the futility of internal wars (e.g., frontal cortex vs. reptilian brain, parent vs. child ego). True wisdom is realizing you set all the rules and can stop playing adversarial games, moving instead to a state of unified, enjoyable awareness.

**6.  "Peekaboo"**
*   **What it is:** A metaphor for how society trains us to ignore direct experience.
*   **How it's used:** Speaker B says children are told to stop playing peekaboo—to stop the cycle of hiding and seeing for themselves. This becomes a metaphor for how we are taught to "keep our hands up" and not look at reality directly, instead following social rules and orders, which creates attachment to views (sīlabbata-parāmāsa).

**7.  The "Dragon" and "Gabriel" (or the Serpent and the Archangel)**
*   **What it is:** A metaphorical extension of Freudian/id-ego-superego and brain science talk.
*   **How it's used:** The "dragon" represents the primal, reptilian brain/emotional id. "Gabriel" represents the judgmental, rule-making superego/parent ego that tries to slay the dragon. Speaker B points out this internal war is endless (like a hydra). The solution is not slaying but integration and friendship, moving from a tripartite conflict (Father/Son/Holy Ghost as persecutor/victim/observer) to a unified awareness.

**8.  The Restaurant Meal**
*   **What it is:** A simple analogy for acceptance vs. judgment.
*   **How it's used:** A meal arrives that isn't exactly what you ordered. You can either eat and enjoy it, or send it back and complain. This illustrates the choice between accepting the present moment as "good enough" (leading to peace) or judging it as lacking (leading to dukkha).

**9.  "Connecting the Dots"**
*   **What it is:** A metaphor for wisdom (paññā) and insight.
*   **How it's used:** Speaker B describes the human mind's prime function as seeing connections. The "aha moment" of a mathematician or in meditation is the thrill of connecting dots. Sustained practice makes life a series of "aha moments" as everything is seen as interconnected.

**10. "Hair on Fire" Practice**
*   **What it is:** A proverbial Buddhist phrase for practicing with utmost urgency.
*   **How it's used:** Speaker A references being told to practice as if your hair were on fire, feeling this conveyed the difference "between life and death." It underscores the vital importance of dedicated practice.

**Underlying Themes These Metaphors Support:**
*   **The Present Moment is Sufficient:** The "peak experience" vs. "ordinary moment," the restaurant meal, and the breath itself all point to finding okayness *now*.
*   **From Effect to Cause:** Moving from being a victim of circumstances (the effect) to being the author of your experience (the cause).
*   **Simplicity and Essence:** The "elephant" story and dismissal of complex "variety" argue that the core Dharma (e.g., Anapanasati, the Eightfold Path) is simple and complete.
*   **Ending Internal Conflict:** The chess, dragon, and peekaboo metaphors all advocate ending internal division and achieving a unified, friendly mind.
