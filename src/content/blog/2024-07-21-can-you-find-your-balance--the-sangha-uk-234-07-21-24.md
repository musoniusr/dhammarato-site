### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So welcome to the Sunday afternoon Thai time, 4 o'clock call. Today we're going to revisit the Middle Path. The first thing that we should start off talking about is that There is a sutta that is well known and famous for being the Buddha's first talk, the one that he gave at Deer Park, Isitanya. After he became enlightened, he went to revisit all of his old friends that left him when they saw that he was getting fat. You see, he had been starving himself, practicing austerities, and he was doing that, I would say, for probably about 2 years. And so of the 6 years that he spent from the age of 29 to the age of 35, he probably spent about 4 years practicing Jhana. And when he went to the absolute end of the Jhana practice, He recognized that that's not what he was looking for at all. And they wanted him to become the major teacher, and he declined. And so he went off with the Jains, with Nātanātaputta, who was known in modern times as Mahavīra, who was the head of the Jains, and he practiced those austerities. Later in the suttas, by the way, he had some pretty scalding things to say about the practice that the Jains were doing at that time. But meanwhile, back to when he fell into the creek and couldn't get out, he made the observation of how is he ever going to find the answer to his questions if he can't even get up out of the creek he fell into? And so he recognized that all the austerities— and by the way, he was really good at it. Everybody knew that he was the very best at punishing himself. And on a side point, their belief system was that because they have worked so hard to get their morality, their Sila, up to scratch, that they are not creating any new resultant bad Kamma, or any bad results from their Kamma. But they were all still miserable and unhappy. Well, guess what? If you're torturing yourself, I imagine that you are. But in fact, the point is, is that that's what happens with meditation retreats in the West nowadays is they put you under a set of rules that wind up sitting, for instance, new people sitting for an hour and they wind up in great pain thinking that there's an education in that. Even in the Goenka retreats, they talk about it as strong determination sittings. And basically all their teaching is someone to be in the training to be able to manage torture, to manage pain. But the Buddha figured out that that's not at all the right practice. And so as he crawled out of the creek, he observed that why is he afraid of pleasure? That the pleasures of the first Jhana, in fact, are not the same as sensual pleasures— going to the bar, going to the brothel, going to the rallies, going to the political events, going to the roller coaster. You know, all of that kind of stuff, seeking thrills and seeking enjoyment that way, rather than just quietly sitting and having fun, having a ball. And when he recognized that, he said to himself, you know, what I am looking for is not being able to attain these high Jhanas, but rather having consistency at the first Jhana. Why? Because the first Jhana is already in the place of Sukkha, which is exactly opposite. In fact, you could begin to understand that when he was out searching for all of those years, he didn't even know what he was searching for. He just knew that Jhana was not finding it for him. And for sure now, austerities are not finding it for him. So the first thing that he did was he started having— I think that it's called rice milk. It was given to him by a cowherd daughter, and he began to have fat. Now, if you have been starving yourself, just one bowl of rice milk is going to put a little belly on him. And his friends didn't like that a little bit. And so they left him, and they went to Deer Park, which is probably about 40 kilometers or so from Bodhgaya, where he was. And so he spent the next 6 weeks figuring out— basically what he was figuring out according to the Upadana and according to Bhikkhu Buddhadasa He was figuring out how the mind works. In the Pali, we call this Paticcasamuppada, and out of that teaching, he comes up with the Four Noble Truths. Now we find him walking to Deer Park, and his friends didn't want to have anything to do with him because after 6 weeks of rice milk, he was probably as fat as I am. They didn't like that a little bit, but they gave him a chance to talk. What he started with— by the way, this sutta now that I'm talking about is known as the Dhamma Chaka Puwanta Sutta. It's in the Samyutta Nikaya, and it is well known that this is the very first sermon that he gave. After he figured out what the mind was. Now, as he introduces it, surprisingly enough, he starts off with understanding the concept of the Middle Path. What he was referring to in the sutta was the Middle Path between the austerities that they were practicing, and the jhanas that they were practicing, because his group that was following him, his friends, his comrades, were practicing the same things that he was. Now, ordinary people, when they read about this, they understand the sensual desires on one extreme to be going to the brothel, going to the bar, going to the nightclubs, going to the music festivals, going to YouTube, that sort of thing. That's where pleasure is found by ordinary people. But in this conversation, he wasn't talking to ordinary people. He was talking to people who were as deep in the practice as he was. And a lot of people then don't understand that the middle way is someplace between all of these austerities and all of this Jhana practice that they were doing. So if you can understand that, then the middle path is not back into hindrances. If you have one extreme of the high Jhanas and the other extreme of the austerities, when you get to the middle path, Where do you land up? Do you land up back in hindrances? That's no place to land up. In fact, the hindrances is just more self-torture. No, the middle path winds up being that first Jhana, being in a state of pleasure where you're not harming yourself with hindrances, nor are you seeking those higher Jhana states. That the pleasure that you're looking for is the pleasure that can be found in the first Jhana. Now we can take that middle path concept and expand it to almost everything that's concerned with Dhamma. First example I'll give you is one extreme is the past, and the further back into the past you go, the more extreme you get. Hello, rebirthers and reincarnationists. And the other extreme is off into the future, and the further off into the future you go, the more extreme it is. Again, hello, rebirthers and reincarnationists. These are extremes, but the Buddha taught the middle path. And what is the middle path between the past and the future? Anybody got a clue? Ben, what does your finger mean? You're pointing to your groin, I suppose.

**Speaker B:** I was saying right now, at this.

**Speaker A:** Point, right here, right now. That's the middle path. Exactly. Okay, now in that middle way, that middle path means that we're kind of balanced. There is a way of referring to it in the sense I would call it dynamic balance, and that another word for it is the Pali word Upekkha. Amrit, do you have a working definition of the word Upekkha?

**Speaker C:** I think it's usually translated as equanimity.

**Speaker A:** But equanimity is a word that was manufactured by, I guess, Goenka. Have you ever heard of the word equanimity before? No, it's not an English language word. It's a manufactured word. I bet it's not even in any of the dictionaries.

**Speaker C:** Yes, what I heard from you is, uh, is like balancing in a boat when the boat is, uh, moving up.

**Speaker B:** And down and you are trying to.

**Speaker C:** Figure out how to balance yourself.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. The story is then is imagine that you're on a fairly large fishing boat and that you're out at seas, high seas. Now the captain of that fishing boat has been on that boat for years. And so in those high seas, he's up on the bow, and he needs to go to the stern, and so he gets up and he walks. Now the boat's shaking back and forth, but he makes it without running into things. Meanwhile, let us say that he has a Buddhist professor from Harvard University on board, who was there on the bow with him, and this guy has never been on a boat like that. And so he gets up and goes with the captain, and he runs into the cabin, he runs into the side, he heaves over the side, and then he goes over the side. Why? Because he doesn't have sea legs. So being able to balance when the deck that you're walking on is not stable. That's equanimity. Another example would be a teeter-totter. You know, the kids go up and down and up and down and up and down, and it's fun to do that because they're both balanced. But if one kid goes down and then gets off the sliding or off of the teeter-totter, What happens to the other kid? He goes ka-wham, right? That's the trick of the teeter-totter, is to get off the thing when you're on the bottom so that your companion who's riding the teeter-totter gets a sore butt. But as long as both of the people are balanced, it can go up and down. So we want to talk about this quality of movement Why? Because one of the major teachings of the Buddha is Anicca. Things are constantly in flux. Things are constantly moving. Can you find your balance in all of that turmoil? Can you find an equal, happy place with the turmoil of the politics? World politics, wars, IRSes, cops out catching people for no reason at all other than they've got a quota. All of this kind of stuff is happening. And the right answer to that is, is that almost no one can handle that. When you get stopped by a cop, You're either going to be afraid, you're going to be angry, you're not going to have good balance. So how do we practice to get good balance? Is by going into seclusion, getting away from the world, getting away from it all. And then the next line is, is that only to find out that you brought the world with you. When you went off into seclusion. So now you have two levels of seclusion. One is to get yourself physically alone, and then the second step is to get your mind out of the past, out of the future, out of the world, so that you can gain things stable and practice getting things stable, getting yourself OK. Now, that basically is not a one-item shot. There's actually some progress, not much, and you can practice all of the levels of progress all in the same sitting, or basically in the same moment. But I want to make sure that you understand that it's there. Almost everyone in the world, let us say 99.9%, probably even higher than than that, live in a world of dissatisfaction. They are taught dissatisfaction. They are taught that they're the little guy and there's some big guy up there that's going to be bigger and better and stronger than you are, and you eat, and you either have to lump it or fight him. But we wind up being in dissatisfaction. We wind up being a victim. A good example of that is, in a way, Donald Trump, being an ex-President of the United States, running for office, you should think that he would be on top of the world. But in fact, he's the biggest victim in the world. He's always complaining about this and that and the other thing. He's a total wimp. Everything is always somebody else's fault. He's got no balance, no equanimity at all, that when things go up, he goes up. When things go down, he goes down. And what we can learn is that we can begin to change that, and we can change it. Um, today I had a friend use word. I forget what it was, but it has to do with really, really liking something. Maybe the word would be perfection. Or, Nikki, did you overhear that conversation? What was the word that they were using? You don't remember?

**Speaker B:** Not sure.

**Speaker A:** It has to do with very, very good, exalted. All right, but when we go to the exalted, when we go from very, very low to very, very high, that's still not balanced. There is no balance in there, and yet this is how we begin to practice. We take our unwholesome thoughts and change them to wholesome thoughts. The basic practice is to start with the negativities that we have been practicing our whole lives and see that those things are negative, seeing that they're unwholesome, and change it around into something beautiful, something positive, something great, something magnificent, something Okay. And we practice that way till we counterbalance all of the negative stuff that we've been doing. And then the third step, also from choice, is we move out of our positivity into equanimity. To allow things to be just the way they are. So in order to gain equanimity, there is a word— these basically come from the Brahma Viharas, and the words are in this order: Metta, Karuna, Mudita, Upaya. Now, this teaching is not actually from the Buddha, that the Buddha did not teach Metta. What he taught was being able to control one's own mind. But in the Seven Factors of Enlightenment, there is the word Upekkha. But we can understand it by going through the Brahma Viharas The Metta, Karuna, Mudita, Upekkha, basically is kindness or friendliness is Metta. Karuna is wrongly translated as compassion, and rather what we can say is that we offer people a way out of their misery. Going back to that boat trip that we were talking about, if somebody falls overboard, let us say that that professor fell overboard, is the captain going to jump overboard too in order to save the guy? Or is the captain going to throw him a life raft and then drag him back aboard? Most people in the West, in fact, it's taught this way in Christianity, is that when somebody goes overboard, jump overboard too. Become a lifeguard in that sense that you've got to swim out there and pick them up and carry them. So if somebody is having a pity party, that answer would be join their pity party. Misery loves company. You become miserable with them. But this is not the way that the Buddha taught Karuna. The way to do that would be don't jump overboard with them, don't join them in their misery, but rather throw them a life raft to get them back on board. Now the next one is Mudita, and that's the one that I want to work with for just a moment. The Mudita is also referred to as sympathetic vibration. An example of that is you put a violin in a room, it's properly tuned, and then a trumpet player comes in and plays A. The string on the violin will start to resonate. The trumpet player leaves, and then somebody else comes into the room with another violin. Guess what? Even though the trumpet player has left the room, that violin, that first violin, is still ringing that note A, you bring a new violin in, and it will very slightly start to get into harmony with the other violin, and their A string will also start to vibrate. This is called sympathetic vibration, and I'm using an example that's physically real. That in fact, when I was both in high school and also later studying music in college, this is one of the favorite labs that the college professors like to do, is to prove to us that musical instruments will start to resonate and harmonize with one another. Well, we can do that also. And so the example that I would use would be the one-two punch The beginner, they would say, you find joy wherever it may be found. Now, the example would be that two people are competing for a job. Let us say that their boss has gotten a promotion and he's leaving, and it's up to him to choose either you or someone else to become the manager. And guess what? The other guy won, and you lost. How are you going to handle that? There's two ways to handle it. One would be that instead of being jealous, you congratulate him. In fact, you take him and the whole team out to supper. You make sure that you're making really good friends that you actually can take joy in the fact that he's the boss now, that you're going to support him and become his number one employee. How many people do you know do that way? Very few. What happens instead is what almost everybody does, is they get jealous. Oh, I should have gotten that job, and I'm going to make life really tough on this new manager. Well, guess what? You're actually destroying your own career because he's the boss. And if you make life hard for him, he's not your friend. You're probably going to be the first one fired. Okay, so this is what we mean by Mudita, is that you can find joy in and congratulate this guy who has won the job, because if you take joy with him, then you're going to be in good shape. But if you get jealous and act jealous, you're actually creating your own Dukkha, your own misery. But now let's turn that around in another way, and let us say in this case, in this scenario, you got the job and he didn't. Now you're the boss. How are you going to handle his jealousy? Are you going to do it in the ordinary way, or are you going to work really hard to cheer him up and bring him on the team? You're going to give him your joy. This is what we mean then by that Mudita, and you can see it from both directions. You can either create misery or joy for yourself if you lose, or if you win, you can see that someone else is going to be miserable and you can bring them out of it. This is the Mudita. And then the next step would be the Upekkha, and that is equanimity or balance. Now let's use a crude example. This example, in fact, Arhat Thanissaro uses. It's coming from the medical situation. You've got a hospital and you can see that during COVID especially, that a lot of the nurses did not want to treat COVID patients. Why? Because they caught COVID. Somebody miserable, they've got COVID, there are patients in the hospital and the nurses catch it. The same thing happens, by the way, in medical school. That is quite famous. In medical school that whatever topic, whatever class that students are taking, whatever disease they're studying, they think they've caught that disease or somebody in their family. They can't just study it as a disease to be studied. They got to go look for somebody who's got it, mostly me. So if we're studying pancreatic cancer, all of a sudden I've got pancreatic cancer. This is the style that we have for ordinary people. So in that situation, let's say that the doctors take a great deal of joy when he can cure someone from COVID But guess what? They lost a lot of people to COVID. And a lot of the nurses not only didn't like catching COVID themselves, They didn't like nursing people back to health only to have them die. This is called burnout. Teachers have burnout. If all the students that the teacher has is learning well, she's happy. But if some of them are Bart Simpson or not doing very well in school, the teachers want to quit. They don't like getting burned out. They don't like being failures. Doctors don't like losing patients. Do you know of a doctor who actually likes losing his patients? Maybe Hannibal Lecter, but other than that, doctors want to keep their patients alive. And yet, guess what? Every patient that the doctor has is either, one, going to outlive the doctor, or two, the doctor is going to watch them die. Doctors watch people die. And a lot of doctors don't want to practice medicine. They get burnout because they don't like to lose their patients. But a doctor who has equanimity, when a doctor has Upekkha, what that means is, is he can tolerate the losses because he knows that you win some, you lose some. There's sometimes the ship is going this way and we're happy, and sometimes the ship is going that way. And if we're not careful, we're going to fall overboard. So this is what we mean by the middle path. Can you always find a middle path so that when things go up, you don't go up with it? When things go down, you don't go down with it. You are able to maintain your balance. The balance point in the mind between what is good and what is bad. The balance is between unwholesome and wholesome. David, pop quiz: what words would you use for the balance point between unwholesome thoughts and wholesome thoughts?

**Speaker D:** The balance points between wholesome thoughts and unwholesome thoughts. Neither unwholesome nor unwholesome thoughts.

**Speaker A:** You want a hint? No thought at all. So the balance between being joyful that you saved your client and being miserable because he died is that balance point of having no feelings at all, that you're maintaining your equilibrium. Just like the ship's captain, he's learned, he's got his sea legs. Can you get your own sea legs for life, Amrit? Can you do that?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, definitely.

**Speaker A:** Yes, but we have to practice. And the way that we practice is one, starting off with the unwholesome and practice having wholesome, one wholesome thought after another, after another, after another. And when we get really good at having one wholesome thought after another, after another, we could actually then refine that down to first Jhana. That's the path. But then the second point would be to start putting gaps between the wholesome and the unwholesome thoughts. So you have a wholesome thought, a wholesome thought, a wholesome thought, nothing happening, and then another wholesome thought. Almost always when people are practicing, they'll have a wholesome thought, a wholesome thought, but then it'll be followed by maybe either nothing or an unwholesome thought again. So what we're going to start practicing is either having wholesome thoughts or nothing much at all. That's where the Upekkha comes in, is when you're no longer dealing with sympathetic vibration. Or another way of thinking about it, the doctor now is just practicing medicine. He's not trying to save patients, and he's not disappointed when they die. He's just merely practicing medicine. This would be the balance— just doing it. Now, out of that comes great joy. I know that that's kind of a surprise, but in fact, the Dalai Lama talks about it like that. That happiness, he says, there's nothing much to it. That the real happiness is when everything is easygoing, that there's no ups and no downs. Because that's what all of those ups and downs of life is— something that you created. You told yourself a story about it and put yourself down, or you tell yourself another story and build yourself back up. When you stop telling stories and allow reality to just be reality, it winds up being just a paradise. That's all it is, a real place. No ups and no downs to it, just absolutely steady-state reality. It's in great flux, by the way, great turmoil. And yet one thing that's consistent to it is that reality itself doesn't have any feelings. When things go up in reality, reality doesn't have a reaction to it. It just maintains that equanimity, the reality of it. So, Thomas, with an U, do you have any remarks about this?

**Speaker E:** It was a nice reminder. And definitely something related to these Dhamma talks. Sometimes I wanted to sit still the entire Dhamma talk. And what a relief. I don't have to. I can just keep that body.

**Speaker A:** That's a good word to use. What a relief it is that I've given up the ups and downs, that I can maintain a new kind of happiness, the happiness of release, the happiness of the freedom from being up and being down. So the ship itself is going back and forth, the deck is going up and the deck is going down. But if you've got your sea legs, you can manage that and you can just keep going and going. So Thomas with an H, what do you have to say?

**Speaker F:** No, I second what Thomas said. A good reminder. I had one question. You talked at the beginning about.

**Speaker A:** Retreats.

**Speaker F:** The retreat format can sort of lead to striving and unnecessary suffering. I know that at Suwan Mokkh they do 10-day retreats there as well. Is that style of retreat and the format there different to what you might expect in some of the The answer.

**Speaker A:** To that is yes and no. The answer to that is po. The answer to that is yes, kinda. Right. Now, to be honest with you, guess who actually started doing those retreats? Who was one of the very first ones?

**Speaker F:** Possibly you.

**Speaker A:** When I started, I didn't really understand what I was doing, so I pretended to be a little Goenka. And so that's what started the formats. But over time, especially Achan Po, had made some really major changes to it. One of the major changes is, is that they do not sit for long periods of time. They only sit for 30 minutes, and they give proper instructions that if you've got any leg pain, if you find discomfort, then the right thing to do is to stand up. And if you're still not ready, or if you're droggy, go outside and do walking meditation, and then come back in after 5 or 10 minutes and sit back down. They never teach that at the Goenka retreat. Oh no, you're supposed to sit there no matter how much pain you've got, waiting for the bell to ring. So at Wat Suwan Mokkh, they give you a whole lot of options because they're not there to make you miserable. They're there also— the teaching is different because they do talk about getting rid of unwholesome thoughts and just beginning to sit there and enjoy yourself. I don't think I ever heard, with all the times that I was sitting with Goenka, not once in the talks that he gave was he talking about changing the mind. In the beginning, they have the Anapanasati, they call it, which was just watching the breath, watching the breath, and then they have the scanning, but they never actually go with a change model. The same thing is true with the Mahasi. I've done Mahasi retreats, not so many, and there they talk about noting, noting this and noting that and noting this and noting that, and keep noticing, keep working at it until you begin to see all of that stuff begin to fall apart. And when things like get get dissolving, that's when the Dark Night of the Soul— I make a phrase— comes in, in the sense that people become afraid, they get miserable, they get unhappy, they get into a state of despair, and they get into a longing, a strong longing: I've got to get out of this. So that's steps 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. And step 11, then, surprise, surprise, in the 16 stages of insight, step 11 is a strong, strong determination to make a change. You see, at Wat Suwan Milk, we start off with making changes right away. We don't have to wait for our 15th year of practice. We don't have to wait for our 30th retreat to finally get to the point that we've got to make a change here, because this is not working. And with that, step 11, that strong determination to make a change, that's when the Eightfold Noble Path and the Four Noble Truths really begins to take hold. Until then, all that time, they haven't been practicing the Eightfold Noble Path and the Four Noble Truths. I don't think that I ever remember Goenka talking about the Eightfold Noble Path and the Four Noble Truths. If they did, it's hard to miss. The whole point about that right noble effort. You've got to make a change. You've got to see what you're doing is unwholesome, unsatisfactory, unwelcome. And when you can see that what you're doing is a pile of crap, now you can make the determination, "I've got to change." And where are we going to change it to? We're going to change that negativity into positivity. Everything is all right is an absolute dead-on secure way of getting rid of fear. But people get really fearful in those retreats. Oh, I must be doing it wrong. I'm miserable here. And the answer is, is that everything's okay. Everything is fine. There's nothing dangerous here. Everything is all right. No worries, no problems. And so we begin to say things like, I can handle this. Everything is all right. Nothing much is going on. And so we begin to practice that positivity, which then with the language that I'm using moves you into that neutral state, that state of balance, that state of Upekkha, so that we don't go up and we don't go down. Things are not good and not bad, they just are. And so the retreats at Wat Soan Mokkh, I would say, are kind of unique in the world because they actually follow the Eightfold Noble Path. They actually talk about it, make it easy on yourself, don't be hard on yourself, don't want something. You see, almost all the people who take retreats like the Goenka retreats or the Mahayana retreats, they want something. What do they want? They want to be enlightened. Well, guess what? If you're wanting something you don't have, that's Dukkha. Wanting enlightenment is Dukkha. You're going in the wrong direction when you want enlightenment. The reality is you're already good enough. You don't need enlightenment. What you need to be is accepting the way things actually are. That's real enlightenment. The real enlightenment is hunky-dory, nothing to it. There's really nothing there. But wanting enlightenment, that's strong desire. That's as bad a desire as going to the Bravo, going to the races. Going to the military, all of those ordinary things is because people want stuff. And here, or in the case of the military, wanting to get out of it, you want desperately to not go. But some of them are gung-ho, they're desperate to go. And the answer is, let's find balance here. Let's not go up and go down. When things are up and down, we can maintain that equal place, that noble middle path. This is what the middle path is. So, Ben, do you have any comments?

**Speaker B:** I did have a day, maybe a few days back, and I noticed that for quite a chunk of the day I was just out and about walking around, but I wasn't thinking. And it was so much more peaceful, so much calmer, so much more perceiving and hearing things. But it didn't cause a reaction, and it was, it was harm.

**Speaker A:** I'm not following you. Micah, can you help me?

**Speaker B:** Ben was saying that a few days ago he was walking around and not having very many thoughts, and it was much more peaceful in the mind.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's what we're looking for, is that peace of mind that comes when things are not up and they're not down, when nothing is happening. So when nothing is really happening, there's not much thoughts about what's happening., and you could just be okay without having thoughts about trying to fix something because nothing's broken. Ivan, do you have something to say?

**Speaker B:** Oh, um, yeah, Upekkha is such a beautiful word. I just realized that, uh, if anytime in my life, if something is going down, I could see, okay, this is a good time to practice to stay balanced. And there's so much control in that understanding. It really gladdens the.

**Speaker A:** Mind. Right. The mind becomes bright and pure when it's not being poked at by good and bad. David, do you have any remarks? You're at Wat Soan Mokkh.

**Speaker D:** That's.

**Speaker A:** Right. Have you volunteered to help with the retreats yet?

**Speaker D:** I asked Ajahn Metteyya if he needs help, if he needs.

**Speaker A:** Volunteers.

**Speaker D:** But he didn't really answer. He just said, well, usually people have to enter the course 3 times before they volunteer.

**Speaker A:** Ah, but see, he doesn't know anything about you. He doesn't know you've been through the course yet.

**Speaker D:** I told them I went through it once.

**Speaker A:** Already.

**Speaker B:** You did Deepa Bhavana as.

**Speaker A:** Well. You've gone to a Vipassana retreat also, and he doesn't know.

**Speaker D:** That.

**Speaker A:** Right?

**Speaker D:** But it's okay. I probably will just enter again.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. Well, the best thing to do is to not ask him, to just show up and be a volunteer.

**Speaker D:** I'm not sure if that would.

**Speaker A:** Work. Well, right now Kathle is at Dhamma Kiim. I would recommend that you go and stay at Dhamma Kiim for several reasons. One is that Achaan Metta does help with the retreats. Acharya Metteyya is good. He works with the Westerners, and that's one side. Okay, so because of the retreats, staying at Dhamma Khyam, and on the days when Acharya Metteyya is not there, you would eat at the retreat center. Because of that, you would become familiar to Arhat Metta. Or not Anagami, but to Khun Metta. He would see you around if you stayed at Dhamma Kiam. Number 2, there's Kat there. You've got a good friend. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker D:** Uh, I do see him at least once a week. I see Kat, and I, I'm able to visit Dhamma Kiam during the day, but I don't know if I want to stay there yet, actually.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, if Kat can handle it, I'm sure you can.

**Speaker D:** I could, I could, but it's a question of do I want to handle.

**Speaker A:** It? Well, you're handling Wat Suwan Mokh pretty well, I suppose.

**Speaker D:** It's definitely much more loose here in.

**Speaker A:** Terms of.

**Speaker D:** The schedules and rules and regulations.

**Speaker A:** That's right. Wat Suwan Mokh is not a training wat. But Dhamma Kiem, according to the, let us say, the style of Ajahn Metta, he had in fact always— Dhamma Kiem has been a training wat. And so that would be of value to you. I know that you really like the laid-back nothingness of Wat Suwan Mok, but that's only because you can handle it. You'd be surprised at how many people freak out when there's nothing happening. They need that structure. Okay. And not only that, but the advice would be, when you know that Ajahn Metta is coming for you, get scarce, be hard to.

**Speaker D:** Find.

**Speaker A:** Get.

**Speaker D:** Scarce, be hard to find.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, be hard to find when he's.

**Speaker D:** Coming to look for.

**Speaker B:** Me.

**Speaker A:** All right, so being around him, being around Kat, and being around the meditation retreat center, there are all the advantages that you would have to watch Sohamokkhaya. And as we've just covered it, at Sohamokkhaya you got.

**Speaker D:** Nothing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So, Carl, do you have any comments? Are you on?

**Speaker B:** No comments here.

**Speaker A:** Just no comments. How about you.

**Speaker B:** Ross?

**Speaker A:** No, all good, Dhammarato. You're all good. Okay, well, does anybody have any comments before we finish up? Uh, everybody got Upekkha? Ben, do you get it? You got some Upekkha?

**Speaker D:** Dhammarato. Arhat, you mentioned the Mahasi stages of insight. You said stage 11 would be when the student gets the strong desire to get out of it. Yeah. But I think stage 11 is actually equanimity.

**Speaker A:** No, no, it's not, right? Not, not the list that I know of from the Visuddhimaga. Now, it's been years since I've read it, so I may have missed a number or two, but I do know that strong desire to make a change, to get out of it, is the step immediately before the Four Noble Truths. And I strongly remember that that's Step 12. And how can you in fact get equanimity directly out of coming from the night of the soul? You just bounce right into being in despair, into being equanimity? Not a chance. You've got to go through the positive to get there. You can't come from negative to zero. Why is that? Is because from the negative, getting to zero is an uphill climb. You're working. But if you're already on top, if you got the positive, then sliding down to zero is easy enough to do. It's a downhill journey. Now what I'm talking about here is actually from electrical engineering. This is actually the way that the atoms operate in reality, is that you don't go to zero from the zenith to zero. You always come to zero from the zenith, not the nadir. You go from the top down to zero. You never come from the bottom up to zero. And for that reason, I would suggest that equanimity is not Step 11. In fact, I would go so far as to say that equanimity is not even in the 16 stages of insight. The 16 stages of insight is about practice, that in fact, the 16th is ongoing evaluation, which is what we start with. Funny like that, that the place that the 16 stages of insight end up with is where we start. So in a real important way, you could say then that the 16 stages of insight is for normal people to come up to the level of noble, to where we are starting with noble. And it's through the noble and the understanding of wisdom is where we can come from the negative to the positive to the balance. So I challenge you, go get that 16 Stages of Insight and show me equanimity, especially as Step 11. Sure, you'll find it someplace on the internet. Amrit, go right ahead, I'm listening.

**Speaker C:** Yes, uh, one question. So Mahasi took the 16 stages of insight directly from Vishuddhimarga?

**Speaker A:** Um, let me say that there's two Mahasi methods. It's important to understand there is Mahasi Samadhi who was the grandfather, the guy who got it all started. And in his work, you will find a whole chapter on joy. But after he died, a political monk named Upandita took over. That happens with many places. Luckily, that didn't happen with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa because Ajahn Po was already established as the, the abbot emeritus. But in the Mahasi, the new kid on the block took over. By the way, the same thing happened when Vilamaramsi died. This lay cat, this lay dude that's all into rebirth and reincarnation, he took it over, which means that the Vilamaramsi good stuff that they were doing is going to crash land. So That's basically what happened with the Mahayana method when it came from Upandita to the West. It became hard-nosed, tough-nookie, sit for a long time, note and note and note and note. It was like he missed out on the very best part of the practice. And so that's what Western Mahasi method is. It's not actually Mahasi's method, it's Upadana's method. Ben, you got your hand up. Go.

**Speaker B:** Ahead. Is the— you're talking about after putting in wholesome thoughts, being able to just sort of have no thoughts. Is that the same thing that Ajahn Samadhi calls the deathless, or Bhante calls the unborn Buddha mind, or liberation, or enlightenment? Like, is that the sort of— okay.

**Speaker A:** First off, it can happen naturally. It can just happen. An example of that would be people do by happenstance, win the lottery. It just happens. But we're not just winning the lottery, we're rigging the lottery. We got to practice it, we got to work at it, we got to put the right effort in. The right effort is to start getting positive. Start saying everything is okay, everything is fine, not a worry in the world, I can handle this. Wow, we're great. Become that champion. Because once you gain the position of being a champion, that's the time to retire. Okay, imagine that there is a prize fight and you have two boxers. And after the fight, both of them go to a massage and get a massage. And while the two boxers are getting massage, you can imagine that the winner is having different thoughts than the loser. That the loser is saying, "Oh, I've got to do this, I've got to work harder, I've got to get this going." Or maybe he's having thoughts of, "Oh, I should quit this, because I'm no good at it." —to where the winner may say, "Hey, I'm on top of the world, now is the time to retire." That Muhammad Ali would have probably not gone back and done any boxing after he became the world champion, except that they took his championship away from.

**Speaker B:** Him.

**Speaker A:** In fact, you could see that where that happened was that he did retire, because when he was drafted, he wouldn't go to war. Here he is, the world champion prize fighter, and he won't even go fight for the U.S. government. So, they stripped him of his title and put him in jail. After that, he comes back to get his title again. If he had just kept his title, then he could have quit in success. So this is the way that we practice, is we've got to get really successful at our practice, and then we can just relax. We've won. But if we're not successful at our practice, that's where most people quit their practices because they're not successful, but then they haven't got anything for their practice. 'Oh, that Buddhist stuff is just a bunch of crap,' you know, is their attitude. Why? Because they're not successful at it. This is what I again mean, that you can't come to zero from the nadir. You can only come to zero from the zenith. You got to learn to become a champion. You got to learn to have one happy, wholesome thought after another, after another, after another, after another, before you can put real gaps in it. Who did that? So, I hope that answers your question.

**Speaker B:** Ben.

**Speaker A:** Thanks, Dhammarato. So, does anybody else have anything to say? Good enough.

**Speaker B:** Huh? Just got that.

**Speaker A:** Wow, what a relief it is. I can shut up now, guys. This has been a delightful talk. I've really enjoyed it. I hope that you've been able to take my Mudita and start vibrating.

**Speaker B:** Happily.

**Speaker A:** We'll see you.

**Speaker E:** Thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, Dhammarato.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A), focuses on the **Middle Path (Majjhima Patipada)**, using the Buddha's first sermon as a starting point to explore a practical, balanced approach to meditation and life.

### **Core Summary:**

**1. The Historical Context of the Middle Path:**
*   The talk begins with the Buddha's experience after enlightenment, revisiting his ascetic companions at Deer Park.
*   The Buddha had tried two extremes: deep **Jhana (meditative absorption)** and severe **austerities (self-mortification)**. He found both unsatisfactory.
*   The "middle path" he taught in his first sermon was **not** a compromise between sensual indulgence and asceticism for ordinary people. It was a middle way **specifically for dedicated practitioners** between the extreme of high Jhana states and the extreme of self-punishing austerities.
*   This true middle path, Dhammarato suggests, is found in the consistent attainment of the **first Jhana**, a state of pleasure (*sukkha*) and focus free from hindrances, without striving for "higher" states or inflicting pain.

**2. The Middle Path as Dynamic Balance (Upekkha/Equanimity):**
*   The Middle Path is presented as a **dynamic balance** in the midst of life's constant change (*anicca*).
*   It is likened to having "sea legs"—maintaining stability on a shifting deck, or finding the balance point on a teeter-totter.
*   This balance is called **Upekkha**, often translated as equanimity. It is not passive indifference, but a skilled, balanced responsiveness to life's ups and downs without being thrown off emotionally.

**3. The Practical Path to Balance: A Three-Step Training:**
   1.  **Replace Unwholesome with Wholesome:** Start by consciously replacing negative, unhappy thoughts with positive, beautiful, and kind thoughts. This counters a lifetime of negative mental habits.
   2.  **Cultivate Sympathetic Joy (Mudita):** Learn to find joy in others' success (e.g., congratulating a rival who gets a promotion). This breaks the cycle of jealousy and creates shared happiness.
   3.  **Arrive at Balanced Equanimity (Upekkha):** After mastering wholesome thoughts, one can introduce gaps of "no thought" or simple awareness. This is the balance point—not reacting to wins or losses, but maintaining steady composure like a seasoned doctor who helps patients without burning out over outcomes.

**4. Critique of Common Retreat Models:**
*   Dhammarato criticizes retreats (e.g., Goenka, some Mahasi) that emphasize long, painful sitting and "noting" without teaching the **active change of mind**.
*   He contrasts this with the approach at **Wat Suwan Mokkh** (founded by Buddhadasa Bhikkhu), where the practice is gentler, encourages comfort, and immediately focuses on the **Eightfold Path** and **Four Noble Truths**—specifically, recognizing unwholesome states and actively replacing them with wholesome ones.
*   A key point: **Wanting enlightenment is itself a form of craving (dukkha)**. True practice is about accepting the present and finding balance, not striving for a future goal.

**5. The Goal: Peace in "Nothing Happening"**
*   The ultimate peace is found when the mind is not pulled into "good" or "bad" stories. It's a state where "nothing is broken" and nothing needs to be fixed.
*   This is a happiness of release—freedom from the rollercoaster of reactions. It's a steady, peaceful abiding where perception is clear without compulsive mental commentary.

### **Key Metaphors & Examples:**
*   **The Boat Captain:** Having sea legs (equanimity) vs. the seasick professor (reactivity).
*   **The Teeter-Totter:** Balance requires both sides (or a skilled center point).
*   **The Doctor:** Practicing medicine with care but without attachment to every outcome (vs. burnout).
*   **The Violin:** Sympathetic vibration (*Mudita*)—resonating with the joy of others.
*   **The Boxer:** The champion who can retire at the peak (zenith) versus the loser struggling from the bottom (nadir)—illustrating that balance comes from success in wholesome states, not from misery.

### **Overall Message:**
The Middle Path is a practical training in mental balance. It starts with actively cultivating wholesome thoughts to counter negativity, progresses through learning to share in others' joy, and culminates in a steady, equanimous mind that remains unshaken by life's inevitable flux. This path is framed as kinder, more effective, and more aligned with the Buddha's core teachings than severe, striving-based meditation techniques.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain Buddhist concepts, primarily focusing on the **Middle Path** and **equanimity (Upekkha)**. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **1. The Buddha’s Story (Historical/Narrative)**
- **The Buddha’s asceticism and awakening**: The speaker recounts the Buddha’s journey—practicing severe austerities, realizing it wasn’t working, nearly drowning in a creek, and then accepting nourishment (rice milk) to regain strength. This sets up the **Middle Path** between extremes.
- **The first sermon at Deer Park**: The Buddha’s first teaching (Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta) is framed as a rejection of both extreme asceticism and extreme jhana (meditative absorption) practice.

---

### **2. Metaphors for the Middle Path & Equanimity**

#### **a. The Ship Captain in High Seas**
- **Metaphor**: A seasoned captain walks steadily on a rocking ship, while a novice (a Harvard professor) stumbles and falls overboard.
- **Purpose**: Illustrates **Upekkha (equanimity)**—the ability to maintain balance amid life’s turbulence.

#### **b. The Teeter-Totter (Seesaw)**
- **Metaphor**: Two children balancing on a seesaw; if one jumps off, the other crashes down.
- **Purpose**: Shows how **balance requires mutual adjustment** and awareness—and how imbalance causes suffering.

#### **c. The Sympathetic Vibration of Violins**
- **Metaphor**: A tuned violin’s string vibrates when a matching note is played nearby, and can cause another violin’s string to resonate.
- **Purpose**: Explains **Mudita (sympathetic joy)**—how joy can be shared and amplified, like vibrations harmonizing.

---

### **3. Modern-Life Analogies**

#### **a. Workplace Competition**
- **Story**: Two people compete for a promotion; one wins, the other loses.
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates **Mudita** (being happy for the winner) and how jealousy creates suffering, while shared joy benefits both.

#### **b. Doctors and Burnout**
- **Analogy**: Doctors who become emotionally attached to saving patients experience burnout when patients die.
- **Purpose**: Contrasts ordinary attachment with **Upekkha**—the balanced mindset of doing one’s duty without being swayed by success or failure.

#### **c. Donald Trump as a “Victim”**
- **Example**: Trump is portrayed as someone constantly blaming others, with no emotional balance.
- **Purpose**: Illustrates the **absence of Upekkha**—being tossed by ups and downs, unable to find a middle ground.

---

### **4. The “Path of Thought” Metaphor**
- **Metaphor**: Moving from **unwholesome thoughts** → **wholesome thoughts** → **gap between thoughts** → **equanimity**.
- **Purpose**: Maps the progression of meditation: first replacing negativity with positivity, then cultivating stillness, then arriving at a balanced, thought-free awareness.

---

### **5. The Boxer Retiring as Champion**
- **Story**: A boxer who wins the championship and retires at the peak, versus one who loses and struggles.
- **Purpose**: Symbolizes the idea that **you must first cultivate success (wholesome states) before you can “retire” into equanimity**. You can’t jump from suffering directly to balance; you need a period of positive cultivation first.

---

### **6. Retreat Practices as Metaphor**
- **Comparison**: Goenka-style retreats (enduring pain) vs. Wat Suan Mokkh retreats (adjusting posture, being kind to oneself).
- **Purpose**: Critiques **extreme practices** as a form of self-torture, and advocates for a **Middle Path approach** in meditation itself.

---

### **Key Themes Linked to Metaphors**
- **Middle Path**: Not just between sensuality and asceticism, but between past/future, thought/no-thought, effort/relaxation.
- **Upekkha (Equanimity)**: Presented as **dynamic balance** in motion, not passive indifference.
- **Mudita (Sympathetic Joy)**: Framed as a resonant, contagious quality that uplifts everyone.

These metaphors and stories make abstract Buddhist principles relatable, emphasizing a **practical, non-extremist approach** to meditation and daily life.
