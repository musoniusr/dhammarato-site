### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, let's assume that it started. This is a Sunday afternoon, and the funny part is, is that everybody on this call is in either Thailand or Malaysia, and it's afternoon. And so welcome for this time of day. And Matt had a question. Go ahead and restart your question, Matt.

**Speaker B:** I don't know if it was a question, maybe more of an observation or statement. It's that in my life, when I first got into Buddhism, I saw that it was obvious that I needed to separate myself from people who had a tendency to think unwholesome thoughts and engage in unwholesome behaviors. Which led me to be in isolation. And now I'm thinking that I need to put more effort into finding people who are the opposite, who are more wholesome and have more wholesome behaviors and thoughts so that I can improve myself. Because it seems like if I'm by myself, I tend to just do what I did in the past as opposed to becoming better.

**Speaker A:** All right, now without going too much further, than that. What we can say is that many, many people see that beginning part and try various opportunities of getting out of it. All right, some people will in fact think that if all— if they get a whole bunch of money, they can leave that civilization, go buy my own island or something like that. And retreat from the world, and so they plot and scheme to rob Fort Knox or something like that. Well, dream big if you're going to fail anyway. So, if you recognize then that that is a very common thing, it is actually easy enough wisdom to come across. It's in fact possibly the beginning of the spiritual journey, is to wake up and say, "What a crap! This is all a bunch of crap!" And then, the next stage would be withdrawal from that, once we wake up to it. But in fact, that's almost a microcosm of the entire teaching of the Buddha. In the sense of the two-step process of knowledge and vision and seeing what's going on, and deliverance from it by dropping it, getting rid of it, throwing it out. That that's in fact the process that we're working with with Anapanasati that got you to the state that you could see how big that pile of crap actually was. And it's all over the place and everybody else has got that same kind of— to be generous, we could say false wiring. Not the kind of wiring that's into the DNA completely, where we have no control over it, but rather the wiring of all of the rules and the way that things are supposed to, the standards. It's sort of like this: how does an electrician wire a house? He wires that house according to the plan that he was given. He was told how to wire that house by the regulations and the laws. Okay, so that's how we wire our own brain, is around the regulations that we learned in childhood. Don't go there, don't say this, you're not big enough to do that, ouch, that hurts. And so we've learned this whole life plan, and when we begin to wake up to that and recognize that it manifests itself in the form of unwholesome thoughts. And as we begin to see the unwholesome thoughts and start cleaning that stuff out, we begin to see the whole world in a brand new way. Before, we saw it through the same colored rose glasses that, you know, and when we take those glasses off, we see that everybody's wearing those same colored rose glasses and we want away from it, we want out of here. Because actually part of that education is— and this is where a majority of the people get stuck in— when they see how bad things are, they want to go fix it. They see society's troubles and they go on sometimes on a rampage to get it fixed. Marjorie Taylor Greene is a clear example of that. She's just a little deluded about what she hates. So, hello, Pedro. And this is a stopping point for many, many people. You could call these the zealots. The ones who see what a pile of crap that civilization has become. And I guess you could say, in a kind of a big intellectual, conceptualized way, this is the fight-or-flight syndrome that we have, when primitively, we would confront or compound some predator or some enemy. And so that's how we would behave naturally due to our genetics. Those are the two big choices that we'd make once we see the danger. The trick is, are you going to get stuck in fight, because you're going to lose that one, or flight? And that's the next step, but it's got its limits too. And so then, the next logical stage is to not just flee, but to find better places to flee to. And that's part of the reason why, especially in the time of the Beatles, you had a mass input of immigrants into India, camping in Nepal, checking out Sri Lanka. Kind of party group trip myself, for years. And that they were all seeking something. This is in fact what the Southern Baptists call an Anagami, a yearning to go someplace else and get out of here. 'Let's go to Africa and save all of the natives.' And so this is a widespread held fight-or-flight mechanism that we go through. But then some wisdom starts to pop in there, and so the frontal cortex starts to come into play there, hopefully. Because the other possibility is whatever rules we're supposed to keep, like, oh, I couldn't possibly go do that, I couldn't go and fight, and I couldn't go away, so now I'm stuck with it. Poor me. All right, and so there's all of these possibilities that we go through at a natural place, but eventually we come up to the point of recognizing that there is a way out of this, because I can find people who have found their way out of this, and that they stay kind of out of it for most of the time. And whether they're in it a little bit of the time is not important. The point is that that's the way that everybody's intending to live, is living like you're the king of the world, on top of the world. Because why? What's your other choices? Either be buried under your own pile of world, or clawing your way out of it, trying to get to the top of it, or being on top of your own world. And when you recognize that others have actually gone to the top of their own world and they can manage that pretty well, Anapanasati. Those are the kind of people that are worthy of association. This is, in fact, that's a— there's a key word in there, and that is worthy, worthy of respect. Friends that you're going to go and live with because they're worthy of your time, they're worthy of your attention, they're worthy of your generosity, Matt. And when we recognize that they're worthy of respect and generosity, then that's what builds Sangha, because they're practicing those same things so that they can see you guys as worthy also, worthy of their respect, worthy of their honor, that we feel honored to be friends with one another, because we're finding some good people to associate with. And here those that are planning on that, and working on that, and growing it, here they are, off into places like these achans that they're finding, that Daniel has located. There are so many really high-quality, excellent meditation and Dharma teaching all over Thailand. There's so prolific, there's thousands of them, but the Westerners seem that they are not in existence because they don't know about them. They're not within my world, therefore they're not in any world. Yes, Matt, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** You just answered basically what I was going to ask, but it seems to me that a lot of people don't actually believe these people exist. And I know some people who think that you're the only one, for example.

**Speaker A:** Well, guess who my teachers were?

**Speaker B:** Other people.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, that's right. And, and that's one of the, the points. It's really good as an example when you're sussing someone out. How do they approach their lineage? Where does this stuff come from? If they're saying they dreamt it up on their own, that's suspicious because this stuff is so rare and so hard to figure out that it takes a Buddha or two now and then to be able to figure out that all you have to do is see what the problem is and then set it down. That's too much for most humanity to figure out. And so we want to see them. I couldn't have figured it out without Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's instructions and theoretical backgrounds and understanding all of the stuff from that point of view, and then getting kicked in the butt and slapped in the face and having to walk on hard rocks and learn to coordinate my hands and learn to have great big bumblebees an inch long crawl across my head while I'm standing and talking to Ajahn Po. Actually, it was the other way around. I was watching him having a great big wasp crawl across his head while we were talking together. That was an instructional point for him. And that's the kind of thing that the lineage has that we can do something with on the internet. But another point was that Ajahn Po and Bhikkhu Buddhadasa were not my only teachers at Wat Suwan Mokkh. All of the monks were teachers of each other, and they were all good friends with each other, joking and laughing and pointing things out and all of that kind stuff, OK? And the Thais are better at it, and the Westerners get uptight. And so, in fact, one of the qualities of that, or an example of that, is imagine that you've got 4 or 5 teenagers that are, let us say, crossing through traffic and going on whatever normal road that there is, and that one of them misses his step and slips and falls. Now in the West, they'll turn around, they'll wait on him, maybe they'll ask, does he need help? Especially if there's women there, they'll go and help him and whatnot like this. In Thailand, if that happens, everybody's gonna laugh, including the guy who slipped and fell, 'cause it's no big deal. And nobody comes to help anybody. [Speaker:Dhammarato] They're teasing him, like almost hazing, like at a school for kids, except that the hazing has already been done and now this is the afterglow of the hazing, "Ahaha, we got you!" Okay, and get up and let's go. And so that kind of mentality then is quite instructional, because we will allow it. Basically, that spoonful of sugar. Let's put some humor in life, because then life's lessons are a whole lot easier to swallow. And it's really, really good to be around people who are willing to spoon-feed you life's lessons with a smile. And that's why we do want to associate with the wise. And that's the next step along the way. This is what most of them would talk about. Even if they don't say it in that language, this is the desire to ordain, which is also wrapped up with being able to get away from it all in that worldly sense. But where we're going is at least worthwhile going. That in fact, when I was first at Wat Soan Mook, I felt like the place was a nature park. I felt like, let us say, a young Indian brave running through the jungle. That was the kind of feeling that I had there. It was a huge, huge forest, and I very much loved the place for that. So this, this whole idea of being able to fall in love with the place that you're in and the people that you're around and feeling like you're at home is something that most Westerners kind of lose By the time they're wearing long pants. And that's something that I was able to rediscover at Wat Suwan Mokkh. But I did that after I had ordained. The question is, can me, by telling this story, help each and every student who listens to this tape be able to see that for themselves and recognize that yes, there is value in knowing that there are ways and places to where you can actually come home in a way to relax, that you're finally at home and there's no place else to go. That's really an amazing kind of feeling that you've kind of arrived at where you want to go. That you don't want to go anyplace else. You've already been around the world a couple of times, or 3 or 4, stopped along many, many places, many cultures. So what's the point of traveling on? It's just okay to be where you are, but you gotta kind of get to the state of loving wherever you are. And finding a place like that for you guys in Thailand, it's really possible. If you look around, you can find something. Find some noble Thai people, find some noble— I mean, they don't even have to live in the Wat to be very generous and kind and excellent, high-quality people. That's the neighborhood that I live in, by the way. First of all, the actual landlord, Mr. Arsam, is actually the head layman at one of the biggest Wats on the island, which back doors to his property. It's only like a minute or so walk, uh, and that he keeps track of all of the equipment that they use whenever they bring out all of their party equipment or funeral stuff or all of that. He's got all of that stuff, uh, squirreled away in the garage right across the street here. So this is the kind of community that I'm in with his family, and that they've got 4 or 5 houses around, but They're constantly bringing food and bananas and fish that have been caught and all kinds of things to share. And so Tam makes sure that they do that too. It's a community kind of way of living. But about half the time, we will arrange for the transportation for the kids, and then the other half of the time, the the other family well, and so we get the kids back and forth. Yeah, we have two kids on a motorbike is basically what it is, along with the driver. But everything is really shared, and that's one of the qualities that I like. If we go build a house, all of that's got to start over again. But here we are. I feel like I've reestablished that kind of family that I was found at Wat Soan Mokkh. I can recreate that, now that I know what it is that we need. And what is that? Family, friends, people. And so, that's the point then, of seeking out good people, nobles. Watts is full of those kind of people. Good to associate with. In fact, the ideal situation that many people kind of note— and sometimes this is an important point— is look at who lives in the houses that are close by the wat, and then think back historically why that would happen. And then you can recognize in Fremont, California, they've got a huge Thai wat there, but much of the property in the vicinity of that are owned by Thai people who now have the wat right across the street. A way of saying it, that's very Jewish of them, you know, because that's the way, you know, the Jewish tradition is, you've got to walk to the synagogue. So if they build a synagogue, everybody in the Jewish community is going to go build their houses around that. That's the way that it is here in Thailand, and that we can establish that also, in the sense of the Westerners can become— because there's 4,000 or 5,000 Westerners on this island, no community at all, nobody knows anybody, unless you typically hang out at the same bar. And so, that whole idea— I'm going on too long about finding noble friends and staying with them— is much, much superior to just merely retreating. It is not so much of getting out of the situation, it's more of, "Yeah, but where are you going to go?" Okay, and then the next one, which is the big step 3 that we were talking about right at the very beginning of the conversation, was that what are you going to do once you have gotten that noble, worthy mindset straightened out for yourself? Do you have 24 hours a day? What kind of entertainment do you want? And I mean, if you have in the first place lived with the knowledge for a while that the whole world is nothing but a soap opera, well now, we can go watch the soap opera. That part of the tradition that I have seen is that in the village, the boys in the village, they know about the village what, including all of the old uncles that are there and that kind of stuff, and they go there, they know the place, and so when they're able or ready, let us say old enough to ordain, they ordain in that wat amongst their old uncles and their family and everything else. And after the young monk is well trained for a few months or a year, then he's sent to the forest wat where the real training goes on. And that's the distinction, very strong distinction, but the Westerners don't understand it until it's really strongly pointed out. But once he's in that forest walk, that's then the seclusion. He's away from the world. And that's where the training is done, so that he can get that world out of his system and come back to a peace, at home, at harmony and everything. In Thailand they have the word sabai sabai. The way that they say it is relaxing, just Sabai, Sabai. Okay, so this is the way that we're going to be living our life for a while, out in the forest or the wilderness, or at home, or in an empty hut, or whatever like that, having close friends by, getting the own mind straightened out. And then the mind is worthy, it's come up to a point, maybe not 100% of the time, but certainly more than 90% of the time, and certainly down not down there at the 30 to 20% that it normally is for people of getting their mind in and working. In fact, there's an old story from the 1950s that the human mind is so sharp, but most people only use 10% of it. Have you heard about that? Well, one of the ways of restating that is because, of course, that's completely wrong. If they understood the whole point about what the amygdala does and what the cortex does, which one, and the cerebellum and all of the functions of all of that stuff in the brain, then they would not say that because that doesn't make any sense. But what we can say is that people are, yeah, they use the whole brain all the time. They're just pointing it in the wrong direction about 90% of the time. Really, really bad shots, us human beings. Or another way of saying it, that we're only thinking about 10% of the time, and the rest of the time we're on kind of automatic pilot. And so the whole practice then is taking that range from about 10-20% at best And by the way, those who engage in certain activities and certain sports and that kind of stuff actually develop a sensory awareness that will put them up 20-30%. You know, like Samadhi swordsmen and batters and some football players and all kinds of other sports really train the mind. Boxers, for instance, if you start thinking about the argument you had with your grandma, you probably have a face full of fists. Immediately after, because you're not watching what's going on. So there are many, many things that will train us to look at what we're doing, to start watching, being awake, and we can take that, that Sati, and start putting it to good use. Now even in the Mahasi Method, they have the idea of wake up and take a look at what you're doing. But really the whole third point is not only to wake up and take a look at what you're doing, but make a change, which is that very cleaning out of the mind that needs to be done. Waking up and see what a mess it is in there is not so much fun for so long. It may put some Americans into a dark night or something like that. So, let's say that the reason that we're going to actually go out into the woods and get away from it all is to actually learn to figure out that we are actually in a paradise, why don't we enjoy it as such? And stop frowning and farting around about all the stuff that we brought with us. Just let it go, set it down, forget about it. And that, by the way, one of the thoughts that I will have as soon as that kind of stuff comes up, because it does— I mean, it's past, the mind is open and free, and up pops something— and then I'll look at that and I'll say, well, I'm glad I don't have to do that anymore. And then set it back down. I can look at that old house in North Carolina, and I mean, just an image of it flashes by, and then I can say, wow, I don't have to take care of that old house anymore, and set it down. Or, wow, I don't have to cut grass anymore, and set it down. Whatever it was in the past that I was doing that I didn't like, especially the things about myself that I didn't like It's, "Oh, never mind, set it down." And that's the way that we clean it, one little thing at a time. And so, to continue on with that, we can begin to understand that one of the mistakes that Westerners make is actually more of an issue of Hinduism, and a lot of Westerners mix Hinduism with Buddhism. And that is the issue around Anatta, in the sense that there is an Atmos that is out there. This is the big God, or the big I, or the big Self that Maharama Maharishi, Ramana Maharishi, when I read his article, because somebody mentioned him recently, and saw that, oh, this is a curious mixture of primitive Hinduism and Buddhism, but it's said in a Hinduistic way. And one of the things that the Buddha was talking about is this 'atmos,' like the atmosphere we're in, this big beautiful world, this wide paradise that we're in, is actually my interpretation of me, that I and nature are one, that I am the God here. This is the whole idea of it, except that we still stay in that part of feeling insignificant about it. Now what the Buddha says instead is that that 'atmos' is not alive, it's not aware, it's not conscious, and it's not here to rub your belly. It's here because of situations and circumstances, and we were born into that situation and circumstances, and if we can learn to get along in that situation and circumstances, without rebelling and resisting and wanting it to be different and being confused about it because we see danger, danger everywhere, and recognize in fact we are at home. There's nothing dangerous. We can relax. Everything's okay. There's no place to go. We live in a paradise. And we can clean the mind out like that. And when we get to it in that way, now The monk in the forest is kind of ready to go back to the city, what? And be one of the old uncles. So that now he can come and listen to all the tragedies of the world that the old relatives and village people bring to him. And he says, "Huh, there's nothing to it." And let them figure out that there's nothing to it. Their argument is just situational, doesn't matter. And this is part of the way that the Thai system works, is that the elderly monks, after they've gotten the training of having no place to go and nothing to do and feeling completely at home, they then want to let that rub off as best they can to the people in the village. And so the whole— eventually the whole civilization of Thailand winds up being at a higher level. That's one of the reasons I love it here so much, is because the average Thai person is much more awake than your average Westerner. I see you nodding your head, David. Okay. And so with that, because of the language barrier, we misjudge them. Everybody thinks that anybody who doesn't understand what I'm saying must be an idiot. And it's basically the other way around. Everything that's said around me that I don't understand makes me the idiot, except when you recognize that language don't matter anyway, that it's the comfort and feeling of security that we're really looking for, not correct interpretation of the language. And now we're back into that step 3 again of being able to spread the joy that we have gotten in seclusion. Now, in this frame of reference that I've been speaking about, it is sort of a lifetime kind of thing, starting at 20, staying in the wat for 5 years and then spending 20 or 30 years in the forest and then coming back as an elderly old man and just sitting there and being happy with his family while the family sit there with him and being happy. That actually now can be said, well, it doesn't have to be like that. That can be compressed, chopped up, made into a fruit salad. And practiced, because we're living our lives in such that our life itself is already chopped up. Sometimes it's chopped up by airplanes, sometimes it's chopped up by jobs, and chopped up by mommy and daddy, and chopped up by my desires and whatever like that. And so we can recognize, okay, with our time chopped up, that still means that we can still practice all three phases. Of recognizing what Anapanasati is, wanting to get out of it, actually getting out of it, then getting it out of you, and then coming back and dealing with it again happily. That in fact, one of the ways to say it is, is that with all the ills of the world, with all the greed, all of the really big lies and stupidity and ignorance of those political parties, and all the ill will and hatred and racial violence and all of that kind of stuff is what we would define as the world. Except that's just my own attitude. That's not a real world. That's my concept, and I can say it any way that I want to, but that's the way that I see the world. So that's the world to me. Until I change my attitude and say, "Wait a minute, that's the world that I constructed because I've been watching too much of Fox News or something." And so, these are not really my thoughts about the world, that there's other ways to think about the world, and we can think about the world the way that we want to think about the world. The world is not really that ugly. In fact, most of the people that I know, they're okay people, they're struggling along. Almost all of them have the same problems that I've got. I just don't sling them around in everybody's faces, all this everybody else. But we're all the same, that we're not better than one another, that that in fact, that's the part of the atmos, that we're all part of the atmosphere. We all bring the same air, we all have the same junk thoughts that we were taught by the same parents. We're all in it together. So why can't we just teach each other to enjoy it? Because you're not going to be able to fix it, but you can play with it. It's a playground of sorts. So it's an attitude about the world that eventually has to change so that we recognize that it's not so bad. The whole world is my home if I see it that way. Even getting on a crowded bus and fighting for the seat, I still feel at home. Actually, that's not going to happen. I'm not going to get on a bus because I know that I won't feel at home when I'm on that bus that's so crowded. And guess what? The best part is I don't have any place to go. Bus rides not necessary. So if we start to use our wisdom to shut the doors to the things that we know that we should not go in, because therein lies our own boogeyman and dangers and whatnot like that. An example of that is that very few people have played with snakes. I happen to, because of some of the past that I've had, that I've had to deal with them on several different places and levels and whatnot like that. And so I'm not afraid of the snakes around here at all. Because what Thai people aren't either. But the average Westerner, if they got confronted with as many snakes as we do on a regular basis, they'll start killing them. Why? Instinctively, it's because they're afraid. It's not necessarily the culture. It's not the culture that tells them to kill snakes, it's the culture that tells them to be afraid of snakes. And so, that fear can be directed culturally, or we can be afraid of snakes out in the wilderness, and so we have to start dealing with some of them out there. There was in fact one episode that it was one of these bright yellow pythons, and this was a big guy, and he was rolled up. Rainy, rainy night, and I was walking along a pathway next to a really, really high hill that was actually constructed by humans putting rocks in place to get this retaining wall so that they could put a kuti up there on the side of the hill. And in the crash of the night, you're just rolling down this big thunderous thing. And when I got close to it, I recognized that it was a big python. And he wasn't having a good day. And so I left him. And the next day I told Ajahn Po about it, and he says, "Did you tell anybody?" And I says, "No, you're the only one." And he says, good, because if it gets out, the lay people come and eat him rather than just kill him or capture him. Because, you know, in Florida they want to get rid of the pythons there. If those pythons that are there in Florida were in Thailand, or maybe it was the Thai people who were in Florida, they wouldn't have a python problem. All right, so here's all of this stuff about culture, and we recognize that, oh, wait a minute, this is a big, wide, wonderful world we live in, and it's always our own narrow mind from our own position that we think the whole world is like that, that we actually create the world that we live in through our concepts and our ideas and whatnot like that. This is the revolutionary understanding that we come to is that in fact all of the Dukkha that we ever had and ever will have, we're manufacturing it on the spot by our attitudes and our feelings and our thoughts. And we can do better than this. And so that's the cleaning out process, and pretty soon you don't have to deal so much with all those unwholesome thoughts because every time that you make the mistake, you correct the mistake right then and there. That's how, in fact, a good musician learns music, is that as soon as he makes a mistake, he backs up and he plays it again and plays it again and plays through it on. And so this is kind of what we do with Anapanasati, is as soon as you can catch that mistake— hey man, I saw that, that's not who I am— we can Let that go. Throw that out. It's not who I am. Or back to, I'm glad I'm not that anymore. I'm glad that's not who I am. I'm glad I don't live in that house anymore. I'm glad I don't have to deal with those people anymore. And we just raise that gladness level because look how much dirty past that you have personally, recognizing that everybody's got that kind of a dirty past and we hate it, rather than joyfully recognizing, "Hey, you don't have to do that anymore, that's not who you are now." And that's letting go of it, to let go of that past, because that's where the baggage lies. That's the whole baggage of it, that when you're not who you thought you were, who the heck are you? Well, guess what? That's a stupid Who cares? What really matters is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Is this painful or is this pleasant? Over and over again we keep making that decision. Any painful that we see, we can make it pleasant again. And so once we learn that thoroughly out in the forest with our noble friends, the worthy ones, then we can come back and live that life, cheering everyone up. And so that's the whole show. A lot of people think, in fact they complain about, what's the use of a recluse going off into the woods and never dealing with society? The answer to that is, is that when he gets rid of the society in his mind, he can come back and play with the reality of the society that he used to not even know about, because the only society he ever knew was the one that he dreamt up, not knowing it. And now we can come out of the wilderness, back into the real world, with fresh eyes, recognizing everybody's a friend. Got no enemies here. That was a delusion that I had. I make enemies by competing with them, most often not only competing with them, but winning, and then rubbing their face in it. And that doesn't make friends. And so, much of civilization is like that, very territorial. Very tribal, very I don't know you, so I'm better than you are because I don't speak your language, you don't speak mine. And we get this attitude about how bad the world is when in fact it's just an attitude that's based upon ignorance. But it takes a long time to work through that ignorance, mainly because we don't want to. We like our delusions. The story is that you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free, but first it will piss you off, and for some people, it will piss them off permanently. We already like our delusions and our delusions are better than the actual facts in front of us. And one of the delusions, by the way, that I see a lot of Buddhists have is the delusion that comes out of both Hindu and Christianity, that there is some big truth, some ultimate truth, some gigantic truth, and if we could only see that big truth, that gigantic truth, then we would drop all of our baggage. David, you're shaking your head. Do you know what I'm talking about?

**Speaker C:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] Yes, I do. I looked at Hinduism a bit And even in some Buddhist traditions, they make big claims, I think, about reality, right?

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm. Yeah, the big truth, the big it, the big surprise, the big satori is all we need. And that actually is magical thinking that flies in the face of— there's all kinds of things that we're both ready for and can learn, and things that we're not ready for and cannot learn, and that's a wide variety of topics, just like the one that we have been talking about is the very first, is that people fall out of love with the world, and then they start to fight it or try to get away from it. The lucky ones are the ones who try to get away from it, and eventually they find that we are looking not just away but to get to something. You see the sequence in there? Where's the ultimate truth? Which one of those is the ultimate? It's got to be the first one, the very, very first one. I hate this place. That's the ultimate truth, because that's going to get you started. If you don't go through that place, you're going to go nowhere. You're going to sit there and love and hate that relationship with your world and not even know anything about what's going on. But that's not the ultimate truth. No, there's more to learn than that. And so there is no ultimate truth. Maybe in fact there is an ultimate truth, and that ultimate truth is: I don't give a flying rip about the next truth. You come to the end of it, the end of truth. I don't need any more truth. I've got plenty of truth. I don't need to keep piling on more and more looking for something that's even more special than what I've got. What I've got is not special, but it's sure good enough. And so that would be the end, that's the ultimate truth, is get a load of wanting truth. Stop wanting to know the truth, you already got it. But that doesn't sound so ultimate, that's quite depleting, almost yucky, that's not ultimate. And in fact it's too obvious to be ultimate. So, therein lies the fallacy. No, what is the truth is what's happening in the present moment, which changes. The truth is, the truth changes. It doesn't stay the same. Now there are certain kinds of truth that we could call noble. They're not ultimate, but they're noble. Hinayana, Buddhist teaching, and all of that. And that is, the nobleness is that they persist, strongly persist, just like the laws of nature so strongly persist that we would call them noble. But in fact, if you guys have got any chemistry background, you know that there's a whole group of chemicals that are referred to, or let us say elements, that are referred to as noble. And what's the most important quality of that? They don't mess with the other stuff. They don't get into rust. Argon stays argon. It doesn't even stay around, but never mind. The point is, is that a noble gas, or a noble truth, means that it resists and persists the changes. It's somehow above them. They're super mundane. To all of the chaos. This is the distinction then between Samskara and Dhamma. And I'm referring to the little phrase you've heard of Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta. But there is a little better phrase of that, and that is: Sabe Samskara Anicca, Sabe Samskara Anatta, and Sabbe Dhamma Anatta. Now what that means is that even things that are noble and persist still have no self. The Four Noble Truths is not up in the air looking down upon you with a spyglass. And that is possible for some people to start looking at it like that, but it is something that persist. So the Four Noble Truths is that Dukkha persists. Humans have been doing Dukkha for thousands of years and will probably continue to do it, and every child that's born will be born in Dukkha, and if he's really lucky, he'll come out of it because of the association with nobles in young childhood, like the Dalai Lama, you know, they went up in the hills and found him a young Anagami man that says, hey, Mama, that kid's special, we want him. And Mama said, yeah, you can have my kid. And so they grabbed that kid and they turned, set him down, and they taught him all kinds of good stuff. And now they call him the Dalai Lama. But they told him, or the, uh, those old monks, they told Mama, he's special. But really what was the specialness is the education that he got, because he was now around, uh, monks who were worthy were the nobles, so he was raised with the nobles. That's in fact a tradition in both Thailand, the old tradition, and in my lifetime I've actually seen it in Bantambong in Cambodia. And the tradition is that the very, very young boys of the village become young monks, go to the monk school, dress as little monks, live their life at in the dormitory with all the other monks, having a faculty of senior monks. It was very much like a boarding school in style, except that in Venerable Bhante, all of the boys line up in the line that you're supposed to line up, and the senior monk then will take them to the neighborhood where their families are so that mom and dad can see their son every day. It's a marvelous system that they've worked got worked out. And that's why they have that ability to train the kids, and living in that kind of environment. Ajahn Po once told me that he was really lucky because he was a monk from the age of 6 and he never had to deal with women, ever. Didn't have to look at them, didn't go anywhere near them, didn't hear the sound of their voices, Just complete. Not only that, but nobody around him cared about it. Not one kid in the dorm had a porn book. Not one. Nobody knew, nobody cared. I mean, talking about ignorance is bliss. And here we are all hung up because in our society we're talking sex, that's the most important thing in life for most of your life, right? Aren't we taught that if you don't get it, you're not a man? All of this kind of stuff is put into the society that we don't really need. We don't have to be taught that way, but that's how the society that we've got has worked out. And once we can see that, we can say, "Wait a minute, I can take that out of my mind too. If Machen Po can think that way, so can I." that there's no reason why— well, let's say it this way: it would be better in Western sports if the women athletes at whatever level dressed exactly the way the men did in that particular sport, as opposed to dainty little bikini swimsuits. They probably wouldn't get near the audience, but at least it would be real sports, rather than watching for the action. But our minds in the West are trained for that. We're trained to look at stuff in a certain way that we miss all the really good stuff. But the point in that regard is, you said, no man, I mean, I'm looking at the good stuff. All of the beautiful arm movements and all the stuff that athletes do, I don't care enough about that at all. I only care about that crotch. That's what I care about. And so when we recognize that, we can say, wait a minute, that's wholesome. I don't have to go around wanting something I don't have. It's better to put those kinds of thoughts out and start looking at the paradise of reality that I have right here in front of me. And that's the training, is to get cleaned out of the mind of wanting things that we don't have and being satisfied with all the stuff that we really do have, because that's the only way that we're going to be able to teach that to anybody, to help them to understand, is by being able to do it yourself, live by example. And so, we practice the way that we do. So in that way, even though you're a layman, from time to time you will be having to deal with that terrible world out there, so long as you see it as that terrible world out there. Or you can deal with that world out there with any opinion about it that you want. So let's try having a positive attitude about the world. It is not the bucket of shit that we think it is. That Buddhism does not necessarily teach that the world is a bucket of shit. Tells you to look at what you're thinking, look at how you believe, recognize that you're creating that. And then we can teach others that, hey, watch what you're doing, look at what you're thinking. Wakey wakey, pay attention, life's not so bad. And so that's the full circle of it. There's the first dog each one of us has to recognize, but everybody does already recognize what a toilet humanity is. Now, some may be saying that, oh, the turd that I'm sitting on is good, but all them others are terrible. But every one of them is loaded down, every one of those turds is loaded down with other people saying the same thing about the turd that I'm living on. And this is how it is. That we'll reserve. It's like that in politics also. We hate every politician in that party, except the one who represents us. So we basically begin to understand that we really do see the whole world through narrow blinders. We don't see it the way that other people see it. But when we recognize that there's no particular way to see the world, other than the way that we want to see it, And so let's practice with that. That's one of the really great values of being able to travel and come to Thailand, is because you were immersed in a culture, just like the best way to learn a language is by being immersed in that language, not listening to headphones from your cell phone, but rather to go and be with people. Okay, so that also applies directly with the quality of being around nobles. So that they can help you clean out and you can help them clean out. The world's a marvelous place to be. And here's my clear example of how wonderful the world is, is these friends that I've got. So I don't know whether this talk has been of much value or not. What do you think, Matt?

**Speaker B:** Well, sure, it's of value. Hopefully it gets through my thick skull at some point. Maybe it has now.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so you recognize there's a couple of steps to go, but you're on your way, man. Yeah. How about you, Max?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, thank you.

**Speaker A:** Anything to say?

**Speaker D:** Uh, no, not, not really, no.

**Speaker A:** All right, no questions or anything? No. David, what's going on?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, good talk. Yeah, so essentially what I've done is I've recognized the world, civilization, society, whatever, is not very supportive or healthy to cleaning out the mind. So that's what I've done is just left that. And here I am, Malaysia.

**Speaker A:** Right. And in July, which is just a few days from now, you're going to be ordaining. Give that a go, see what it's like. Maybe you've got a— and, and the likelihood is, is that you've got some noble Thai monks around. Pay attention, wakey wakey, spend your time around them, become friends with them.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I see how important Sangha is and how important it is to clean up my mind. It's like, this is the direction I'm going. It's like to like build Sangha and to further clean up my mind.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. Okay, how about you, Pedro? You got anything to say?

**Speaker D:** Oh well, so yes, um, honestly, uh, I've wrapped my mind some months ago about like wanting to associate with noble people and so on. For this reason also I've joined the Sangha. At the same time, I see that when I get distracted, I get so much involved in the world, like I plan my future for years and commit to things. And so then I get back to the Sangha and say, okay, but which direction is actually the one I want to get into? But I really— so sometimes I feel like I want to plan practical steps to get more into Buddhist teaching. At the same time, I feel like it's more easy for me to get involved into the world. And when I come back to the Sangha, I realize, okay, it's like I've never really moved from impractical steps from where I was. So I'm trying to understand and journal about it and meditate more. So maybe some solution comes up.

**Speaker A:** All right. Okay. In fact, Pedro is mentioning one of the points that I didn't cover very well. Kind of a detail point in the sense of that do I stay or do I go place. You can hear that in him, okay? Do I leave or do I go? And the answer to that is, is that first off, a lot of people get stuck in that place and it's not comfortable, and they'll stay there for years without either coming. And so By being stuck in that "yes, I go," "no, I stay," back and forth, we fail to recognize that I don't have to jump in the river completely headfirst. I don't have to dive in. I can stick my toe in. I can stick my foot in. I can put a little bit of the time in. That this is better the way to go anyway, that it's not always whole hog. But one of the qualities of that generally has to do with that plane ticket. That plane ticket to Thailand is a big, big step for many people, for several reasons, and not the price of the ticket. But basically, the price of all of these belongings— what am I going to do with those, especially if I check out? Completely. This is part of the process that we go through, that would be called also, from the Sutta's position, learning to live with little. The Four Requisites. And we recognize that we may be carrying more baggage than we need. And I've seen some students come by with Gosh, a suitcase and two enormous backpacks, leaving much of the stuff in Thailand because he recognized that he didn't need it when he brought it. He just owned it, so he brought it, and now I don't care anymore because it was too much work to carry it around. So that's one of the points, and that question of what baggage that we have actually cannot be just physical baggage in the sense of things that have those kind of handles, but also emotional baggage. Fear. Fear of the unknown and fear of what am I going to lose, like the road not taken, you know, the Robert Frost poem, that we got to keep going down the same road even though nobody takes that road over there. I'd like to go down it someday, but not today. And so then the next time that we think about it, going down that road again, there's that road not taken, there's that road not taken again today. I call into a Skype group and there's that road not taken staring me in the face again. And so we recognize that, well, maybe it's not a great big yes or no giant leap, but it's something that we can play with instead. Is that not right, David? You're beginning to understand that you can do both. You can play with both. Your microphone is muted.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, you can be in the world and you can retreat from the world. Yeah, play with both, experiment.

**Speaker A:** That you don't have to go back to the village like the old monks did in the story. You go back next month. You can go back and forth. The door swings both ways. Yeah, and we can find nobles. There's a lot of nobles in the West too. That in fact, if you find a noble in Thailand, you can ask him, well, who do you know this in America? Because a lot of the monks who are in America are the top quality monks from Thailand, and it's an old boys' network. They know each other. And that's what I'm hoping that we can really tap into. There's an old boys' club that I know exists. I was part of it so many years ago. And so tapping back into it should be very easy with the Westerners to find those nobles, those who are worthy of being around, even if you're there with a swinging door and you're there for a week and gone for a week and they're back for a month and then gone for 2 years and then back for a lifetime, you know, up to you, as long as you enjoy the process, knowing that there's this not just great big life cycle that we're talking about, but that that same cycle goes around and around and around, sometimes in one's head in a day. And in fact, when we really get old and gray, that's how we do it. We do through that whole cycle every day. So in the morning, we're paying attention to the group, and in the afternoon, we're gone, out of there, nowhere to go, lost in space, you know. And so when we recognize that it's all just a game, just a cycle, just something to play with, Then we can lose that fear of the unknown, saying, oh my goodness, if I make this great big jump, what if I lose? You know, back to Robert Frost and that road not taken. No, go take that road, play with it. Yes, Matt.

**Speaker B:** Well, I was going to say what made it easy for me to leave the US and Florida and Canada and all that was the realization that I'm going to— if I stay in that position, I'm going to continue waking up every day doing the same stuff over and over and over again and being unhappy. And it got to the point where I had no choice. I had to leave.

**Speaker A:** I understand it. That's right. It's kind of like the psychological straw that broke the camel's back. Or another way of thinking of it is that over time, with your awareness, waking up process, that the Dukkha was here and now your Sukkha is up to a level that things get kind of out of balance and then all of a sudden, whoop! And you say, "Man, I'm out of this Dukkha, I'm out of here." Okay, and that kind of happens with everybody. Eventually we make a choice, but let's not hurry the choice, let's make sure that it's done with wisdom. So that you can weigh, okay, that in fact as a businessman you can appreciate the term cost-benefit analysis, that that's exactly what we're doing with our life, moment by moment by moment, is doing a cost-benefit analysis as we can remember. And then we can say, wait a minute, that's a dead deal, I don't want. Wait a minute, yeah, we'll do that one. And so that's the way that we would do it, that's the cost-benefit analysis of, is this Dukkha or is this worth doing? And when we get really, really excellent, we can come to the position of, is this Dukkha and it's not worth doing, but I'm happy as a lark. And so that's basically the practice of that, so I give that as the gift of the day to you. Matt, this is all a cost-benefit analysis, second by second by second. So, anybody got any last words? Nobody? OK. Well, thank you guys, I really appreciate it. I look forward to seeing you guys next week, too.

**Speaker B:** Likewise.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye. Sure, thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker D:** Thank you, bye.

**Speaker A:** Thanks. Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) in conversation with Sangha friends, revolves around a central theme: **the spiritual journey from disillusionment with the world, through withdrawal and purification, to ultimately finding a joyful "home" everywhere by associating with noble friends (the Sangha).**

Here is a structured summary of the key points:

### **Core Problem & Starting Point**
*   **Disillusionment:** The talk begins with Matt's (Speaker B) observation that recognizing the unwholesomeness in the world and in oneself leads to a desire to withdraw and isolate. This feeling of "What a crap! This is all a bunch of crap!" is identified as a common and valid **beginning of the spiritual journey**.
*   **Fight or Flight:** Upon seeing this "pile of crap," people typically react in two primal ways: **Fight** (trying to fix the world, becoming a zealot) or **Flight** (withdrawing completely). Both have limitations and can become traps.

### **The Evolutionary Path: The Three Key Stages**
Dhammarato outlines a natural progression, modeled on both the Buddha's teachings and the traditional Thai monastic training system:

1.  **Seeing Clearly (Knowledge & Vision):** Waking up to the unsatisfactoriness (*dukkha*) and the "false wiring" of our conditioned minds.
2.  **Withdrawal & Purification (Deliverance):** Stepping back from the world to "clean out" the mind. This is done through practices like *ānāpānasati* (mindfulness of breathing), where one learns to see unwholesome thoughts and "set them down." The goal is to reach a state of being **at home, with no place to go**, feeling *sabai sabai* (relaxed and content).
3.  **Return with Wisdom:** After purifying the mind in seclusion (like a monk in the forest), one can return to society with a new attitude. The world is no longer seen as a hostile place but as a **playground or paradise**. One can engage without creating enemies, spreading joy and teaching by example.

### **The Crucial Role of Noble Friendship (Sangha)**
*   The critical step beyond mere isolation is **actively seeking out noble, wholesome people to associate with**. This is the heart of building a **Sangha**.
*   Associating with those who are "worthy of respect" provides support, humor, and a spoonful of sugar that makes life's lessons easier to swallow. It allows one to "fall in love with the place you're in."
*   Dhammarato gives personal examples from his time at Wat Suan Mokkh in Thailand and his current community, highlighting how living among generous, kind people creates a supportive environment for practice.

### **Key Insights and Corrections**
*   **The World is a Mental Construct:** Our suffering is not caused by the world itself, but by **our attitude and concepts about it**. "We actually create the world that we live in through our concepts." Changing our perception changes our experience.
*   **No "Ultimate Truth":** The talk challenges the Hindu/Christian-inspired idea of a single, grand, ultimate truth that will liberate us. Instead, the "truth" is what's happening in the present moment, and the path is a gradual process of **cost-benefit analysis**—moment-by-moment choosing what leads away from *dukkha*.
*   **Compression of the Path:** You don't need to follow the traditional lifelong monastic cycle. The three stages can be **compressed and cycled through daily**. One can "play with both" engagement and retreat, using wisdom as a swinging door.
*   **Letting Go of the Past:** A practical technique is to meet old, negative memories or patterns with the thought: **"I'm glad I don't have to do/be that anymore"** and then setting it down.
*   **Cultural Immersion:** Traveling to places like Thailand immerses you in a culture where the average person is often more "awake" and the Dhamma is woven into society, facilitating learning in a way that books or headphones cannot.

### **Conclusion**
The talk culminates in an encouraging picture: the spiritual path is about moving from lonely disillusionment to **joyful belonging**. By cleaning our own minds through practice and surrounding ourselves with noble friends, we can transform our perception of the world from a "bucket of shit" into a wide, wonderful home. The journey is a flexible, ongoing cycle of seeing, cleaning, and sharing, not a rigid, one-time leap.

**In essence:** **From isolation to noble association, from hating the world to making your mind a paradise, and then sharing that paradise with others.**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on your transcript, the primary speaker (Speaker A, likely a teacher or guide) uses a rich tapestry of metaphors and stories to illustrate the Buddhist spiritual path, the importance of community (Sangha), and the process of purifying the mind. Here is a breakdown of the key metaphors and stories used:

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **The "Pile of Crap" / "Bucket of Shit" World:**
    *   **Usage:** This is the central metaphor for the unwholesome, stressful, and deluded aspects of conventional society and one's own untrained mind. The spiritual journey often begins with waking up to this reality.
    *   **Quote:** *"What a crap! This is all a bunch of crap!" ... "everybody else has got that same kind of... false wiring."*

2.  **Wiring a House / Brain Wiring:**
    *   **Usage:** Compares the conditioning of our minds (through childhood rules, cultural norms, and trauma) to an electrician wiring a house strictly to code. Our "brain wiring" is based on these learned regulations, not on truth or freedom.
    *   **Quote:** *"that's how we wire our own brain, is around the regulations that we learned in childhood."*

3.  **Fight, Flight, or Find:**
    *   **Usage:** A three-stage model for reacting to the recognition of the "crap" in the world.
        *   **Fight:** Trying to fix the world (e.g., becoming a zealot or activist).
        *   **Flight:** Withdrawing and isolating oneself.
        *   **Find:** The wise middle path—actively seeking out wholesome people and places (the "noble friends" or Sangha) to associate with.
    *   This is framed as an evolution from a primitive "fight-or-flight" response to a wiser, more deliberate search.

4.  **Climbing to the Top of Your Own World:**
    *   **Usage:** Describes the goal of practice. One can be buried under the "pile" of the world, clawing out of it, or living "on top of your own world"—in a state of mastery, peace, and perspective.
    *   **Quote:** *"living like you're the king of the world, on top of the world."*

5.  **Cleaning the Mind / Throwing Out Garbage:**
    *   **Usage:** The ongoing practice is likened to cleaning house. Unwholesome thoughts and past baggage are seen as clutter to be recognized and discarded.
    *   **Quote:** *"I'm glad I don't have to do that anymore. And then set it back down." ... "we clean it, one little thing at a time."*

6.  **The Spoonful of Sugar (Humor):**
    *   **Usage:** Contrasts Western seriousness with Thai light-heartedness. Life's difficult lessons are easier to accept when delivered with humor and teasing, like medicine taken with a spoonful of sugar.
    *   **Story:** The Thai vs. Western reaction to someone slipping and falling.

7.  **The World as a Soap Opera / Playground:**
    *   **Usage:** Once the mind is cleansed, one can re-engage with the world without being caught by it. It shifts from a terrifying place to an entertaining drama or a playground where one can engage skillfully and without fear.
    *   **Quote:** *"the whole world is nothing but a soap opera, well now, we can go watch the soap opera." ... "It's a playground of sorts."*

8.  **The 10% Brain Myth Re-framed:**
    *   **Usage:** Corrects the pop-psychology idea that we only use 10% of our brains. The truth is we use 100%, but we point it in the wrong direction (toward unwholesome thoughts) "about 90% of the time." Practice is about redirecting our innate awareness.

9.  **Learning Music:**
    *   **Usage:** Compares mind training to a musician practicing. When a mistake (unwholesome thought) is made, you notice it, correct it, and play the passage again. It's a process of gradual, attentive refinement.
    *   **Quote:** *"as soon as he makes a mistake, he backs up and he plays it again... this is kind of what we do with Anapanasati."*

10. **Noble Gases:**
    *   **Usage:** Explains the Buddhist concept of "noble" (as in Four Noble Truths). Like noble gases in chemistry (e.g., Argon), which are inert and don't react with or "get messed up by" other elements, noble truths and a noble mind are stable, persistent, and "above the chaos" of conditioned phenomena.

### **Key Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Thai Forest Monastery (Wat Suwan Mokkh) Experience:**
    *   **Purpose:** Serves as a personal and ideal model of Sangha. It's described as a "nature park" where the speaker felt like a "young Indian brave," rediscovering a sense of being "at home" and surrounded by supportive, joking, noble friends (both monks and laypeople). This story embodies the "Find" stage of the path.

2.  **The Python in the Rain:**
    *   **Purpose:** Illustrates cultural conditioning versus innate fear. The speaker encounters a large python on a stormy night and simply leaves it alone. He contrasts this with the instinct of many Westerners (or Floridians) to kill snakes out of culturally ingrained fear. The story highlights how our perceptions and reactions create our reality.

3.  **The Dalai Lama & Village Monk School Traditions:**
    *   **Purpose:** To show the power of early association with "nobles." The Dalai Lama was identified young and raised by wise monks. Similarly, traditional Thai/Cambodian systems where village boys live in temple dormitories from a young age create an environment free from certain societal obsessions (like sex), allowing for a different kind of mental development.

4.  **Robert Frost's "The Road Not Taken":**
    *   **Purpose:** Addresses the hesitation (Speaker Pedro's dilemma) about committing to the spiritual path. The speaker advises against seeing it as a monumental, irreversible choice ("the road not taken"). Instead, one can "play with it," try it out, and understand that the "door swings both ways." It's about reducing the fear of the unknown.

5.  **Building Community in Thailand vs. Isolated Westerners:**
    *   **Purpose:** Contrasts the organic, supportive community around a Thai temple (where laypeople live nearby and share resources) with the isolation of thousands of Westerners on an island who only connect in superficial settings like bars. This story argues for the intentional building of a noble Sangha.

### **Overarching Narrative Arc**
The talk itself follows a metaphorical **three-stage journey**:
1.  **Recognition & Withdrawal:** Seeing the world's "crap" and wanting to flee (the starting point).
2.  **Finding & Cleaning:** Actively seeking noble friends and a supportive environment (the Sangha) to help "clean out" the mind's wiring in a protected space (the "forest").
3.  **Returning & Playing:** With a cleansed mind and a new perspective, re-engaging with the world not as a battlefield, but as a playground or soap opera, able to spread joy and wisdom without getting caught in the drama.

These metaphors and stories work together to make abstract Buddhist principles (like the importance of Sangha, right view, and mental purification) concrete, relatable, and memorable.
