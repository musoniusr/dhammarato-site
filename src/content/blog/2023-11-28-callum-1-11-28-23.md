### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, so have you ever heard of the word Mahasi or Goenka or any of those kind of words?

**Speaker B:** The Vipassana teachers?

**Speaker A:** Yes. Uh-huh. Well, Mahasi didn't use the word, uh, Vipassana as strongly as is being used today. And a funny point is that the word Vipassana does not appear in the suttas except in brackets where the translator has used them as divisions in suttas.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** But the word Vipassana, a Pali word, doesn't generally appear. That in fact, the more important way of looking at it would be investigation, to look, to see what's really going on. And that the way that they do insights is you got to lollygag around, look at your Dukkha, see how Dukkha works, get this Dukkha connected to that Dukkha, go right down the Dukkha rabbit hole, and eventually you'll have some insights about the Dukkha. And in fact, all the insight that you need is to see something as Dukkha and to get away from it immediately. Okay, that in fact the whole quality of having a slow time in practice, taking years and years and years to get anywhere with that, is because they don't take the the right effort, this part of the Eightfold Noble Path. And what is the right effort? To change the unwholesome into the wholesome. Most specifically, in the beginning, to change those unwholesome thoughts into wholesome thoughts. And yet the Western style of meditation generally doesn't do that. That when we come out of the unwholesome into the wholesome, we get great benefits immediately. That if, for instance, you have fear, that fear is unwholesome. Let's change it into the feeling of safety and security.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** If you have uncomfortable— uncomfortable situations are also unsatisfying, dissatisfying situations. So getting out of the unwholesome discomfort into being comfortable.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** So there's immediate benefits. And with being comfortable, safe, and secure, we can work on the biggie, and that is becoming satisfied, because Dukkha actually has the definition of being dissatisfied, being unsatisfactory. And yet in Western Buddhism, Dukkha has taken on the word suffering. To where, like some religious groups like the Jehovah's Witness who go door to door with their pamphlets, can you imagine a Buddhist going from door to door giving out pamphlets saying, "We're going to solve your suffering," and as the door slammed, the guy says, I'm not suffering, as he says in an angry tone and slams the door, not recognizing that anger is a form of suffering. Yeah, we think of suffering as a great big deal. The example would be the skier who's skiing down the hill on the snow and runs into a high high-quality fuel like high-octane gasoline that explodes. Not only does he break every bone in his body, he's got third-degree burns all over his body. Now that's suffering, right? But that's not what Dukkha is all about. It's being dissatisfied in any particular moment.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I understand that.

**Speaker A:** So if we can deal with that as the first noble truth, then we come to understand that the Second Noble Truth is that this suffering is caused by our ignorance. Now, in Tibetan Buddhism and other Mahayana groups, they talk about it is that suffering or Dukkha comes from attachment or clinging, and that that's not at all true, that in fact the Buddha— there's some suttas that talk about it in the sense of wise attachment. There are certain things that are wise to attach to.

**Speaker B:** Really?

**Speaker A:** Right. Like this present moment.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Like being in a good mood.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** By being free from dissatisfaction and being satisfied. These are things we're clinging to. And so that Second Noble Truth is greatly misunderstood. That the three actions are the liking, the not liking, and the ignorance of those two things, including being confused because you don't know whether you like it or not. You don't know whether you understand it or not. And so the ignorance is at the base. One of the stories I tell is in the 2004 tsunami December that happened out in the Indian Ocean on Phuket, on Thailand, all the elephants headed for the hills, but all the humans, all of the tourists, they stayed on the beach and the tsunami came because they were not paying attention. They were ignorant. So getting caught in a tsunami has more to do with your ignorance and your greed for being on the beach. The elephants were smart enough to head for the hills because they could feel it in their feet and they knew what was going on. So this is the Second Noble Truth. And one of the side points of the Second Noble Truth actually is at the heart of the issue. And that is, is that all of the Dukkha that anyone experiences comes not from the outside, it comes from the inside of the mind. Yeah, that's the main point, is that it's our ignorance that causes all the difficulties. And so what we practice then is not necessarily anything like the formal meditation that has become to be known in the West. Some of the habits, bad habits, were picked up by the Asians, but the Westerners have gotten it to the point that they think that there is nothing but meditation. And yet they don't get anything out of the meditation. And they hope that somehow they're making merit or building up something good. And then in a few years or 10,000 hours later, the great Kamma machine in the sky is going to waltz in do some Shaktipat and then they'll feel blissful.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that assumption.

**Speaker A:** And that the real point is, is that if you want bliss, go get it right now. We'll teach you how to do that. It's something to be practiced, it's a skill to be developed. And so most meditations are useless, right? That in fact, the Buddha practiced meditations and got probably world-class, the best one in the world, especially in the time. He went to all the great teachers, and all the great teachers wanted him to be the teacher, and he walked out on them because that does not lead to the end of suffering. That you can sit on the floor forever, how long you want to, going deep into your mind as you want to, etc., like that. But when you get off the cushion, out in the world, you're back in the world again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I noticed that too.

**Speaker A:** That what we need to practice is somehow getting away from the world so that we can practice getting the world out of our mind, right? And when the mind is free and pure, then we can go back into the world and not be of the world. This is the real teaching of the Buddha, is let's get away from the world long enough to get the mind completely free. But that doesn't mean that that seclusion time has to all be sitting on the floor in some meditation hall with Buddha rupas and incense and candles and maybe a monk or some old Western teacher who thinks that he's a teacher sitting there in front of the students so that they'll hold really still, when in fact that's not at all what the Buddha taught. The Buddha did not teach anything about holding still. What he did teach was, is get to know your body very well. Experience the body. Notice what your hands are doing. In the suttas, it talks about being mindful of grasping, reaching, touching, moving your arms around, what it's like for walking. What all four postures are doing, etc., like this. And so that sort of squatting on the floor kind of meditation that's so famous in the West is really not what the Buddha taught. In fact, he rejected it.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And not only did he reject it, but so many of the Westerners now Because of balance sheets and business and bank accounts and all that kind of stuff, we kind of have the fixation, the ignorance about numbers, that we think numbers are higher, that the higher the number— so let's have First Jhana, Second Jhana, Third Jhana, Fourth Jhana. Oh, we'll invent some new ones and have a Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth, and we'll find a sutra or two and we can plug in Nine. Right, okay. But a better way of talking about it would be that the mind can go into various states, and often it happens with everybody but will only go into those states momentarily because we don't know anything about them. And so these various states need to be practiced. But the Buddha Even though the four Jhanas are listed in the suttas, I would say that part of the reason why they're there is because of time structure. I mean, if you're sitting out in the woods with nothing left to do, you've got no cell phones, you've got no communication, you've got no electric power, got no running water, what are you going to do with your time rather than sit there and feel good? Because you've got nothing to do, no place to go, you've got adequate shelter, adequate food, adequate clothing, adequate medical. So what are we going to do with our time? How do we structure our time? Well, nowadays nobody's going to be practicing much with these jhanas because they're too busy with their cell phones, etc., their laptops, TV, telephones, porn, all kinds of stuff. So when there's nothing, when you take all of that stuff away then we'd have time to just sit and do nothing. And we get skilled at doing nothing. And when you get to great big nothings, those are just the Jhanas.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** But the Buddhists didn't see that those Jhanas in and of themselves were liberating. That's why he left all of that stuff. And also he left the Jains under the leadership of Naganaka Putta, which is also known as Mahavira. He practiced that stuff for a while, to the point that he was better at it than any of them. He could out-flagellate himself and out-starve himself. There's even statues that have about the starving recluse, right? And those are not the path to awakening, to removing of the Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so, when Western teachers teach, they often will grab anything to teach, rather than staying focused on the real teachings of the Buddha, that in fact, in several Suttas, I've seen 4 of them so far, where he says he teaches only one thing, and that is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Which means that he doesn't teach anything about belief. Now there are some people, Some very famous people, some translators, some very famous translators that are so stuck in their beliefs that one of them in particular will say, oh well, the direct method, or when he teaches only one thing— no, he teaches a lot of stuff. He'll teach what I want him to teach instead of teaching exactly what he did teach. Which was only one thing, and that is freedom from suffering, Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. And that he also did not practice spiritual powers or beliefs of any kind, and that he discouraged that, wanting his students and Bhikkhus to stay in reality. To stop making magical maps and start living in those belief systems. And yet most Westerners, when they come to Buddhism, they're very, very reluctant to get out of their belief systems. In fact, they want to take what they believe and shove it into Buddhism and then call their belief system Buddhism.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And that's what Western Buddhism has become. There's very little of the actual teachings of the Buddha in Western Buddhism, because it's just full of all kinds of culture, all kinds of stuff. Now, here's a point that's actually quite fascinating, and that is, the Dalai Lama is quite famous. And he's highly regarded as a spiritual teacher. And also, most of the people who really love him have a whole lot of magical beliefs, and they don't understand that the Dalai Lama himself will just put up with them, but that he doesn't have much magical beliefs himself, right? And that I've got a video on our channel where the Dalai Lama has gone to visit Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, who was my teacher in Thailand. And the point, the most important point that I want to make about this is that Buddhism went to Tibet and stayed in Tibet, but there is no such thing as Tibetan Buddhism, right? There are Buddhists who happen to be Tibetan. Yeah, just like there are Thai people who happen to be Buddhist, but there's no Thai Buddhism, right? That the differences are cultural, and the cultural differences were there before Buddhism came. But a lot of people get the two confused, and so they come up with ideas about Tibetan Buddhism, which means Tibetan culture has infiltrated into the minds of some people, so that they think that there is a Tibetan Buddhism, where in fact it can be completely separated out. If you throw out all the Tibetan and leave just the teaching of the Buddha, that's exactly the same thing as what happens in Thailand. Let's throw all the Thai culture out, and we can stay with just what the Buddha taught. This is in fact very similar to the associative law of addition and subtraction. And multiplication, to where A times B plus A times C is equal to A times B plus C. Right? OK. So the Tibetan is B, and Japanese culture would be C, and Buddhism would be A. And so when it comes in, there's an AB, but the A can be separated back out. And because of that, people who really understand the teachings of the Buddha are unconcerned about the cultural differences. But because of the Western mindset being so sectarian-bound by Christianity and other things, they think that there are distinct Buddhisms. There is Zen, there is Pure Land, and there is Vajrayana, and there is Theravada. And the answer to that is, no, you're talking cultures. Let's get out of the cultures and get back to the actual teachings of the Buddha, which is freedom from dissatisfaction. And so right now, Western Buddhism is in a big mess because there's very little Buddhism there in almost all Western culture, including their ideas about Asian culture. And so what we need to do is to forget about culture and start focusing on what the Buddha actually taught. And that is, he taught only one thing: Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. And when we unpack that, the first thing that we unpack it into is the Four Noble Truths. And the only insight that we need into Dukkha is, there it is, let's get out of here, right? We do not have to do any psychological archaeology. All we need to know is, yeah, we picked up a lot of our junk, a lot of our old maps, all of our old ideas when we were children, when we were too young and too stupid. To see what was real. And that often a lot of kids can see what's real, and then they get punished for that. Yeah, and get lied to. And so they forsake the real and take on the culture. That most of the kids that I know of, 3 and 4, they would rather play than learn their ABCs and 1-2-3s. And if they could learn to play when they're 3 or 4 and continue to play, they could have a joyful life if they never learned to read. But in fact, in our culture, it says, oh, you have to have an education because you have to make money. And everybody winds up getting money and are still miserable.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I can see that quite clearly.

**Speaker A:** So the real teaching of the Buddha is not actually about the culture. Including our cultural ideas of what is meditation. And this is why I don't use the word very much, and I do not call myself a meditation teacher by any stretch of the imagination. But what I do teach and what I do share with my friends is Dhamma, the actual teachings of the Buddha, and how to practice that. And we need to practice it like a skill because we were raised without developing those skills. Yeah, the last example that I gave is a lot of kids can figure out what's real, but they won't stay with it because the culture and their family and their teachers and all force them out of the real into the imaginary, into the maps. Yeah, that we live in a system of mental maps. And most people don't know the difference between what's real and what maps are. And so this is what we need to do to practice that, is to figure out what's actually real and what is our ideas, our concepts, our critical thinking, all of that kind of stuff. Our criticism, our self-criticisms, and especially all the rules about how things are supposed to be.

**Speaker B:** And you think it's totally possible to somewhat revert to that childlike state? Because I've noticed here, as I've got older and become more left brain, I look back to childhood and I think, well, why was it so wholesome then? Why was I doing so well? Why was I so creative and free, and it doesn't seem like there's a way out.

**Speaker A:** Well, yes, there is. And basically what you could say is that life is, um, very much like we start off in childhood. It's like walking on the beach, and we're walking on the beach and we see beautiful shells and things, and so we pick them up and take them with us, right? But over the years, we've got a big burden of shells, something like you've seen the statue of Atlas carrying the world on his shoulders. Okay, well, that's all the shells that the child picks up on the beach. The question is, are you going to take one shell out at a time and recognize that you don't really need this shell, that I'll keep this one and throw that one out and put this one back in the bag and throw those down? So that we can make the bag smaller, because that's the way that Western Buddhism is taught. And the other possibility is Atlas can shrug that stuff right off. He can throw the whole bag down, and he can do it right now. And if he winds up picking up more shells, he can throw those down too. So this is the, um, the point is, is that all of this is in the moment.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** If we see that pretty shell, are we going to pick it up and carry it with us? Are we going to leave it alone, set it back down? We don't need it. And so long as we keep putting stuff back down, then anything that we pick up doesn't get heavy because we'll put it right back down as soon as it does get heavy. Yeah, but we don't live our lives in that way. Our culture teaches us then in fact the teaching itself is part of that burden.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And so the whole practice then of Anapanasati is to see the various objects that we'll take. You can call them objects of meditation if you like, but all of these objects that we take will be a skill that we will develop for that. And that one of the skills that we need to develop is to being able to change our mind-state. That we can change our thoughts first, those are the easiest to change, but then we can begin to change the mind-states, as well as our attitude. In fact, attitude and mind-states are very similar.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And so we can in fact change our mind states. We can also change our posture. We can change what we're doing with the body. We can slow down, we can pay attention to what the hands are doing, keep the hands off the face, keep from brushing our hair all the time and touching ourselves and whatnot. So there's a lot that we can do by noticing what we're doing with the body, because the body is already okay. It doesn't need touching and loving and petting and scratching. It's already okay. And so we can work with the body, and we can work with the mind, and we can work with the mind states, and also the objects of the mind. And then when we get skilled with doing those things, we can also begin to work with the feelings.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And so now we have all four of the foundations of mindfulness. Have you ever heard of the word Satipatthana?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, this is what we're talking about, the Satipatthana, the four foundations of mindfulness: the body, the feelings, the mind, the mind's objects. So these are the four items, and that we practice that through Anapanasati. So basically, we have the Eightfold Noble Path, which is the real teachings of the Buddha, and then he gives an object, the Satipatthana, to perform that Eightfold Noble Path on. And one of the curious stories is that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa made the point that the Buddha only taught one kind of meditation. Now you'll find in the Visuddhimagga and other later documents and things that he taught 40 different meditations, right? But Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was quite challenged with this by the Pali scholars in Thailand, and they've got tons of Pali scholars in Thailand, unlike in the West where we've got a dozen or fewer, and that they couldn't find any place to prove him wrong. They couldn't find any place to prove him wrong, that the only teaching that the Buddha gave about how to practice the Eightfold Noble Path was the practice of Anapanasati, and that we practice Anapanasati for the fulfillment of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness And by fulfilling that, we also fulfill the Eightfold Noble Path, but in the fulfilling of the Eightfold Noble Path, not the beginning of it. In the beginning, it's a skill system that needs to be developed, but once it is developed, then it's referred to as the Sambojana, or the factors of awakening.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so what we're practicing with the Eightfold Noble Path is to practice the awakening, and we practice it through Anapanasati on these four foundations, leading to eventually knowledge and deliverance, is one of the ways of talking about it. But in fact, this leads up to— you've probably heard the word enlightenment, right?

**Speaker B:** I was going to ask you about stream entry, actually.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, let's look at enlightenment before we talk about stream entry, because the word itself has a dual meaning or a dual purpose. One is enlightenment in the sense of throwing some light on it, the light of day, turning the lights on, which has the ability to actually see. So if we can actually be the kind of enlightened that gives us the knowledge and the information about what's really happening right here, right now, by shining a light on it, then we'll have the ability to do something about it. And what we do about it is to drop it, to put it down, which comes into the word of moksha, which means freedom, liberation. Also, sometimes in some suttas it's translated into deliverance. But this is the way that we could say enlightenment is, is to shine a light on it, and then lighten up about it.

**Speaker B:** Right. How is this different from repression?

**Speaker A:** Well, when you're doing that, you are practicing. Remember that the practice is not squatting on the floor, that that's a form or a formation. That's not the actual function. That in fact, it doesn't matter what posture you're in, doesn't matter where you are. The question is, is can you actually see what's going on rather than following a map? Right now, the maps often are referred to as rights, rules, rituals, laws, ways, supposed to standards. —right?—and that the Buddha has a Pali word for that, Silabhatta Paramasa, and it is often translated as attachments to rites, rules, and rituals, and you could go so far as to say that generally, that's what we mean by mapmaking. The map is how things are supposed to be according to the paper. You look at the map and you say, "Oh, the reality is like that." And you go out there in reality and you get lost. And in fact, one of the maps that I was playing with when I was a kid that my dad had because of his natural gas, he had actually not all the towns that we visited had this, but in one particular town they had a map of everything that was under the ground. All the power cables under the ground, all of the gas pipes, all the water pipes, all of the sewage pipes. But that's all that map was. And if you really didn't know yourself your way around those pipes, because there wasn't roads or buildings much on that map, and so it was hard to figure out where you were using that kind of map, right? But if you knew where you were, having that map would be good for knowing where you can dig and where you can't dig, right? All right, so maps then, by their very nature, do not actually put out the information of reality. Not only that, but reality is dynamic. On a roadmap, Google Maps can run you right into a construction zone because the mappers didn't know that they had set up these, these cones for the day. Right. And so we live according to the maps that we've made since childhood.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, the Pali word— another Pali word for this is called Samskara. Have you heard of the word Samskara before?

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker A:** All right, um, we'll get into it, but I've just given you the basics, is that the Samskara is basically the sum total of all of those shells that you picked up your whole life.

**Speaker B:** Oh, it's the Sanskrit word Samskara.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** It'S often translated by the, uh, the poor translators. They— here's the thing, the Polytechnic Society was the ones who did it. They started about 1880 and ran into the 1920s doing all the translations, and in the process they built lexicons or, uh, cross dictionaries. And now all the translators use those old dictionaries that were written by people who didn't know what they were doing. And so when the translators use those instead of investigating what the word actually means, they'll just use it out of some dictionary, right? And so, uh, the word Samskara is badly translated, like almost all of the really interesting words, like Dukkha for instance, badly translated.

**Speaker B:** Sort of like an impression.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** I had Samskara down as a kind of impression.

**Speaker A:** Well, not— you could say that it is, but a better word of talking about it is the dents, like dents in your armor or dents in your, uh, you know, pound in, you know. They call them also, uh, traumas, right? Okay, so it's a collection of old trauma.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And that we carry that around as that's our map of what the world is like, right? So you're supposed to avoid people that do this. If they wear a turban, you got to stay away from them, or if you can, give them some trouble, wipe them out. Because we learned that from people who didn't know anything about turbans, and so they were afraid of them. That in fact fear is the major issue with the world. And so if you can come out of your fear, if you're not afraid of anything, that's freedom.

**Speaker B:** Not be nice.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's intentional to stop being afraid. You have to train yourself to not be afraid. So when you have thoughts of 'Oh, the cops in this town are bad because they stop people and give them tickets and whatnot like that,' then we wind up being afraid of cops. In fact, something very curious about that is that on the surveys that they have made, people will say that they're more afraid of the cops than they are of wrecking their car. And yet the cops are out on the road to try to prevent accidents, and they wind up being the problem, not the solution to the problem. And people are still afraid, but they're now afraid of things that are irrelevant. But the real issue is that if you're afraid to crash your car, then you'll drive safely, and if you're driving safely, the cops really are irrelevant. And so, if we see life like that, then we can begin to put ourselves in safe environments and then talk ourselves into the fact that we actually are safe, rather than having these feelings of being unsafe. And the feelings that we have of being unsafe are often called anxiety, panic attacks, stress, all of these kinds of words that we have. Because we're afraid. And so the right way to practice is to practice, intentionally practice, oh, there's nothing to be afraid of. There's no snakes on the floor, there's no crocodiles, the SWAT team is not busting down the door, the Russian mafia is not in town, and I'm safe. But we can think about writing an email to the boss and get all freaked out.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So the actual practice then of the Eightfold Noble Path starts with getting a view that's correct. Now later we'll talk about it in greater detail, but the point that I want to make right now is that right view and right noble view is not the way that most people think in the sense of a worldview, a viewpoint, a way of looking at the world, is not what we mean. What we actually mean by right noble view is better said as right noble viewing, looking, investigating. Stop making maps, stop following the maps, and start looking at what's real through the senses, getting into the senses so that we can see really what's going on. And so we start with that. Then in fact, you wouldn't have called me if you didn't have some right view. You could see things. You saw a video and you say, I see that, and let me investigate this further. Okay, but sometimes people will view those videos and they say, huh, he doesn't know anything because I already know. I've got all of my maps, I've got all my ways of how things are supposed to be. And then with that wrong view, that wrong viewpoint, they don't bother to actually investigate. All right, now the investigation is based upon something, and that is that you're not going to investigate until you remember that you're going to investigate. We have to remember to keep practicing.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Rather than, oh, I'm in the map and I'm in the map. No, remember that you're in the map. Come out of the map and get back into reality.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Then, like I said one time before, is that people have automobile accidents by following the map. They've got their cell phone out and they got their Google Maps and they're looking where they're going, and then they crash their car because they're not looking where they're actually going. They're looking at the map.

**Speaker B:** Right, so we commonly term this as mindfulness or Sati.

**Speaker A:** Well, Sati has gotten— it's a bad translation, mindfulness. Then in fact, most people never ever heard of the word mindfulness. Maybe it's crept into the vocabulary of English nowadays, but in the old days nobody ever used the word mindfulness. That, that was an invented word. To try to describe what Sati is, and Sati has much more the quality of remembering to come out of the map, to remember to be in reality, remember to stop having thoughts of the past and the future and come into the here-now so that you can observe.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And then once we make that observation, the third item of the Eightfold Noble Path comes into play, and these three things together is the primary part of the practice for quite a while, and that is Right Noble Effort, to remember to look at what's going on, see the Dukkha, and come out of it right now. Not investigate the Dukkha, investigate it only to see that this is Dukkha, and then drop it. It's almost like walking by a pile of of dog turds, you know they're dog turds. See them, don't step in them. But if you step in it, now you got to really deal with the dog turds because you got to scrape your shoes off, wash them off, do something, right? But you can in fact get so into it that you take a sample back to the kitchen, take your knife and open it up and look at it and investigate it. And this is what meditation is all about, is taking dog turds off the street, taking them to your kitchen, and investigating them, right? But the right thing to do is just see the dog turds on the road so that you don't step in them, and that's all you need to know about dog turds.

**Speaker B:** And that's it. It's as simple as that, really.

**Speaker A:** It's as simple as that.

**Speaker B:** You just recognize you're creating suffering for yourself and just let it go.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. That there's a lot of suffering going on with practice of meditation. That it doesn't— for most people, it does not solve the actual issue. It puts them deeper in it.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** So that's all that it takes, is to be able to investigate the dog turds of our mind, the unwholesome thoughts, thoughts of revenge, thoughts of being afraid, thoughts of what we're afraid of. Thoughts of what we want, thoughts of confusion, thoughts of doubt, thoughts of worry. Now I'm naming the five hindrances. All right, so anytime that we can see that the mind has come into the hindrances, come into the unwholesome thoughts, we can change it right then. The Buddha had a phrase, aha, I see you, Mara. And this Mara, this devil, that's the unwholesome thoughts that we have. And we can divert ourselves from that. In fact, in the beginning, there is more than one way to do it, but the two that I recommend that people look at is: Number 1 is diversion, and Number 2 is to talk about it's not mine. You heard about Anicca, okay? It's not mine. Those dog turds are not mine. They don't belong to me. So if I have a thought about writing an email to the boss, that's not my— that's not my email. Forget about it. Throw it out right now. I'm having fun being happy. So when we have thoughts of politics, oh, those politics don't belong to me. Those politics belong to politicians. Let them have their fun killing each other with their words. So we can take those two approaches. One is by diversion out of the unwholesome into the wholesome, and that the other one is to just throw it all out. It's not mine, not me, got nothing. And so in a way, it's interesting to say that freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose. Once you as Atlas put down that whole world of worries that you're carrying, you got nothing left. Oh yeah, it's not my business, I throw it out. This is where the concept of Sunyata, or emptiness, comes in. Is that it's not mine. There is no self there, which means nothing has any meaning at all except that which you put back into it in your own selfish little way. But ultimately, nothing means anything. But we are taught, part of our Samskara, part of our standards, is to know the difference between above standard and below standard, between right and wrong, and good and evil. But most people have the mistake that they think that because I like it, it must be good, and because I don't like it, it must be bad. And this is where Adam and Eve wound up by making judgments, and then they had to put up with their judgments of finding, uh, you know, the— they call it the knowledge of good and evil, which means that's good, that's evil. That's good, that's bad. That destroys our paradise. Yeah, because we're making rules about it. So that's another one of those dog turds that we need to see. Are we judging things based upon whether we like it or not? And let's come out of that because it doesn't belong to us anyway, right?

**Speaker B:** So is all— does all Dukkha stem from mental conceptualization, really, because I'm sure yesterday, like, you had a painful leg, but that can be pain, but you don't have to suffer it.

**Speaker A:** No, I wasn't suffering, but the leg was suffering in its own way. And so my compassion for the leg rather than my pain, because it wasn't pain, but the leg was shouting, it's screaming. Okay, and the leg itself. So another example of that is a kid who breaks his arm, goes to the doctor, gets a cast put on it, and the doctor says, take it easy, let the bone heal. And yet the kids will grab things with their hand, they'll write from school, and they'll use that arm. And every time that we move the hands, it moves all of those muscles in the arm. Moving the bones around and preventing them from actually healing. That if the kid really wants his arm to heal, he needs to hold that hand still. Right? Well, this is one of the advantages then that we have for the practice of Anapanasati, is learn how to slow things down, how to slow down the body, how to slow down the mental processes until we can bring them finally to a stop. That we learn, we need to learn how to steer. All right, we need to learn how to avoid difficulties, that in fact there's no real big issues about what's right and what's wrong. What we do need to learn is what's Dukkha and what's not Dukkha. Because we often in our society attribute good, wholesome things to what's actually Dukkha. And so this is part of the training process, is to know what's wholesome, what's not wholesome. And there's a great— for the beginner, a whole lot of stuff in the middle that they don't know whether it's wholesome or not. Or maybe they'll label it wholesome and later find out that, oh, I was wrong. That's not wholesome. An example of that would be smoking, drinking. Even though many, many places will say, "Oh, drinking alcohol is unwholesome," you also have a whole culture of people who think that it's okay.

**Speaker B:** Especially in Britain.

**Speaker A:** But when you actually can see for yourself that drinking alcohol is not wholesome, you can bring it to an end. And if you're lucky, you can bring it to an end happily. But then we can see that the same thing is happening with thoughts. For instance, sitting and thinking about an argument that you had with someone is not wholesome, because by arguing with someone that we just had a real argument with, we didn't like them very much when we were arguing with them. That's the whole point about being in argument is you don't like what's going on. And so we go away from that argument and we continue to argue, like, oh, I'll get her with this one. I know exactly what I should have thought of this before, right? That kind of thoughts. And not recognizing that she's probably going to have a better answer than you can think of. You can think up the really hard questions to ask her, but she's probably going to have some really good answers for that. 'And now we're back into an argument again.' So the better thing to do is have the thought, 'So she's a really good arguer. Maybe I should not argue with her. Let me be friends with her instead.' Now, those are wholesome thoughts, right? Okay. So this is the whole point about meditation, is that people in meditation are trying to figure things out. And the real point is to just see them and drop them. And that we need to practice this, I would say they use the word formal, like formal meditation. I would rather talk about it in the sense that we need to have a schedule, so that we will schedule our talking, so that we would know when to do it. And I would recommend, you know, they talk about meditation an hour a day, 2 hours a day, 3 hours a day. Can you put up an hour a day? Okay, all right, well, let's not put it up all at once. Let's do it in 10-minute increments, 6 times a day, so that we can get it practiced more often. Because if we only practice 1 hour a day, then that means 23 hours a day we're back into the hindrances. Plus a long history of hindrances, it's going to be a pretty slow process. But if we practice really often, then sometimes between those sessions, like we practice for 10 minutes every 2 hours, then pretty soon we'll remember to start practicing an hour later, then maybe 30 minutes later, and so that we can remember to start practicing really often. To have wholesome thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** That we come out of those unwholesome thoughts by right effort. We have to put in the effort. And then students will say, oh, it's really hard. No, that always really hard, that's an unwholesome thought. Yeah, never mind, start again. When you remember, don't fuss at yourself for the times that you've forgotten. Congratulate yourself for the times that you remember. So this, in a way, is a complete shift around of the way the whole culture is run.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** An example of that would be that they punish children. In the old days, they spanked them and whipped them, and now they do other psychological damage to the kids. Putting them in the corner, or withdrawing their cell phones, or all kinds of stuff to punish. And our prison systems are mostly based upon a punishment model. If you screw up, I'm going to make sure that you pay for it. This is actually a kind of an ordinary right view, and the opposite of that would be the wrong view that kids have, is, oh, I can do what I want to do and I'll get away with it. And then the ordinary right view is, "Oh no, you can't get away with it, we'll make sure. We've got a Kamma machine, and we've got priests, and we've got rabbis, and we've got cops, and we've got teachers, and we've got uncles, and we're going to make sure that you're going to get punished or hurt if you do it against our wishes, or against our rules." And so, here the kid then picks up a whole bag of these rules. So pretty soon, we've got a great big carrying of Atlas' world on his shoulders. That's all of the rules. And so, the right way of looking at it, the noble way of looking at it, is look at what's happening right now, and if there's any Dukkha, throw that out, and come back to a state where you can feel safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. Now these words: safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied, the Pali word that fits that is called Sukkha, and Sukkha is exactly opposite of Dukkha, that if you're safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied, wouldn't that be enough? Why do I have to have something magical about enlightenment that's way off there in the distance, when in fact being safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied We can do that right now. Yeah, let's practice doing that right now. Let's be enlightened right now. We can see what the trouble is and we can avoid it right now. So the Western model of Buddhism is a long-term picking up one shell and maybe keeping it, maybe throwing it out, and picking up another shell and keeping it or throwing out, rather than just put down the whole bag. Mm. And so this is the actual teaching of the Buddha. This is why it's called supramundane as opposed to mundane, because mundane is one step at a time, a little bit here, a little bit there, but never getting anywhere.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I feel like that's what I've done, to consume a lot of teachings, and you never seem to quite get anywhere.

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm. So the way that we're going to practice now is to sit down and start looking at what the mind is doing and then make some changes to it. Start having more wholesome thoughts. This is the basic understanding. This is the way we can get started with the practice. And I'd recommend that you sit down and do this for 5 or 10 minutes, 6, 7, 8 times a day. What time to do it?

**Speaker B:** This look like— pardon? What would a formal 10-minute practice look like?

**Speaker A:** Well, the normal way of looking at a formal practice is you've got to go to a special place, use special clothing, sit in special postures, that kind of stuff. Right. But the kind of meditation that we don't call formal would be putting yourself kind of on a schedule so that you remember to keep coming back and practicing having a mind in a wholesome state. So this is the basic point, and we can continue next time. But I would— you've already known enough about practice that you can do what you want to with your postures and where you are. But what you need to do is to have just enough formality or just enough schedule to say, okay, this is the time right now for the next 10 minutes. I'm going to actually practice coming out of the unwholesome, stop having the thoughts that I normally have, and let's start having some wholesome thoughts like everything's okay, everything's fine, no worries, no problems.

**Speaker B:** And that's what the practice looks like. It's as simple as that. Drop in unwholesome thoughts and replace.

**Speaker A:** Yes. With wholesome thoughts. That's the basis of the practice. Right noble effort. Do something. Do something new. Don't investigate the old and investigate the old and keep investigating the old. No, see that that's old. That's all the investigation that we need. See it and throw it out. Put something wholesome in its place.

**Speaker B:** Okay, it makes sense. It's kind of common sense in a way, but we sort of skip over it.

**Speaker A:** But it— but that's not what the culture teaches. All right, well, let's finish the call now, Callum, and I'll see you in the next couple of days, maybe 3 days or so, and then give me another call.

**Speaker B:** Same time?

**Speaker A:** About— yeah, this is a good time for me.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay, brilliant.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. We'll see you.

**Speaker B:** All right, thanks for that. See ya.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points made by Dhammarato (Speaker A):

### **Core Thesis: A Critique of Modern "Meditation" & A Return to the Buddha's Core Teaching**
Dhammarato argues that mainstream Western Buddhism has strayed from the Buddha's essential teaching. It has become bogged down in cultural rituals, complex meditation techniques, and long-term striving, missing the simple, immediate path to freedom from suffering (*Dukkha*).

---

### **Main Arguments and Key Points:**

**1. Misunderstanding Key Concepts:**
*   **Vipassana & Meditation:** The heavy emphasis on "Vipassana" and formal sitting meditation is a modern construct. The Buddha's core practice was **investigation** (*not* psychological archaeology) and **right effort**.
*   **Dukkha:** It is not "suffering" in a dramatic sense (like severe injury), but **dissatisfaction, discomfort, or unsatisfactoriness** in any given moment. The goal is to recognize it and let it go immediately.
*   **The Second Noble Truth:** The cause of *Dukkha* is **ignorance**, not simply "attachment." In fact, some attachments (to the present moment, to a good mood) are wise.
*   **The Source of Dukkha:** All *Dukkha* originates **inside the mind**, from our ignorance and unwholesome thoughts, not from external circumstances.

**2. Critique of Common Practices:**
*   **"Lollygagging" in Dukkha:** Many insight practices err by dwelling on and investigating *Dukkha* at length, rather than seeing it and dropping it instantly.
*   **Formal Sitting Meditation:** The Buddha did not teach rigid, cross-legged "squatting on the floor" as the primary practice. He taught mindfulness in all postures and activities.
*   **Long-Term, Gradualist Model:** The idea that one must meditate for thousands of hours to someday receive awakening is rejected. **Bliss and freedom are available right now** through skillful practice.
*   **Cultural Baggage:** What's called "Tibetan," "Zen," or "Theravada" Buddhism is often just local culture mixed with the Dhamma. The true teaching (A) can be separated from the cultural trappings (B or C). Western Buddhism is a "big mess" of these cultural additions.

**3. The Correct Practice: The Buddha's Actual Teaching**
*   **The One Thing:** The Buddha taught **only one thing**: *Dukkha* and its cessation (*Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha*).
*   **The Method - Right Effort:** The heart of practice is **Right Effort** from the Noble Eightfold Path: **to abandon unwholesome states and cultivate wholesome ones immediately.** This is a skill to be developed.
*   **The Technique:** When an unwholesome thought (fear, anger, worry) arises, **see it as *Dukkha* and replace it with a wholesome thought** (safety, comfort, satisfaction). Use **diversion** or the reflection **"this is not mine"** (*Anicca*).
*   **The Goal - Sukkha:** The immediate aim is to cultivate *Sukkha*: a mind that is **safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied**. This is the opposite of *Dukkha* and is accessible now.
*   **The Framework:** This practice is done within the structure of the **Four Foundations of Mindfulness** (body, feelings, mind, mind-objects) and the **Noble Eightfold Path**, fulfilled through the practice of *Anapanasati* (mindfulness of breathing).

**4. Practical Advice:**
*   **Forget "Formal Meditation":** Practice isn't about a special posture. It's about **remembering (*Sati*)** to come out of your mental "maps" (concepts, rules, past/future thinking) and be present in reality.
*   **Schedule Frequent Practice:** Instead of one long sit, practice for **5-10 minutes, 6-8 times a day**. This trains the mind to return to wholesomeness more often.
*   **Be Kind to Yourself:** Congratulate yourself when you remember to practice; don't berate yourself when you forget.
*   **The Analogy of Shells:** Life is like picking up shells on a beach. We accumulate burdens (samskaras, traumas, rules). The path is not to analyze each shell, but to **put down the entire bag** (Atlas shrugging) whenever we feel its weight.

### **Conclusion:**
Dhammarato presents a radical simplification: the path to freedom is not in complex meditation systems or years of retreats. It is in the **moment-to-moment choice** to see the unsatisfactoriness of an unwholesome thought and to **replace it with a wholesome one**, thereby cultivating immediate well-being (*Sukkha*). This is the essence of Right Effort and the Buddha's core, practical teaching stripped of cultural and religious baggage.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several vivid **metaphors** and references a few **stories** to illustrate their critique of modern meditation practices and to explain their interpretation of the Buddha's core teachings.

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The "Dukkha Rabbit Hole"**: Used to criticize a style of insight meditation that involves deep, prolonged investigation into suffering. The metaphor suggests getting lost in analysis rather than immediately abandoning unwholesome states.
    > *"go right down the Dukkha rabbit hole"*

2.  **The "Kamma Machine in the Sky"**: A sarcastic metaphor for the perceived passive, merit-building approach in some Western Buddhism, where practitioners hope for a future, external reward for their efforts rather than seeking immediate change.
    > *"the great Kamma machine in the sky is going to waltz in do some Shaktipat"*

3.  **Atlas and the Bag of Shells**: This is the central, extended metaphor.
    *   **Shells on the Beach**: Represent all the mental baggage, rules, traumas, and cultural conditioning ("Samskara") we pick up throughout life.
    *   **Atlas's Burden**: Carrying this heavy bag of shells is like Atlas carrying the world—it's the weight of our suffering.
    *   **The Two Methods**:
        *   *Western Buddhism (Slow)*: Taking out one shell at a time, examining it, and maybe discarding it.
        *   *The Speaker's Method (Immediate)*: "Atlas can shrug that stuff right off." You can drop the entire bag immediately by recognizing "this is not mine" and letting it go.

4.  **Dog Turds (or "Dog Sh*t")**: A blunt metaphor for unwholesome thoughts and suffering (Dukkha). The point is to see it and avoid it, not to take it home and analyze it.
    > *"It's almost like walking by a pile of dog turds... The right thing to do is just see the dog turds on the road so that you don't step in them... meditation is... taking dog turds off the street, taking them to your kitchen, and investigating them."*

5.  **Maps vs. Territory**: A common metaphor used extensively here to distinguish between conceptual thinking ("maps"—rules, beliefs, past/future thoughts) and direct experience ("the territory"—present-moment reality).
    > *"we live in a system of mental maps... you get lost"*
    > *"people have automobile accidents by following the map... they crash their car because they're not looking where they're actually going."*

6.  **The Child and the ABCs**: Represents the loss of innate, playful, direct engagement with reality due to cultural conditioning that prioritizes abstract learning and future goals (like making money) over present-moment satisfaction.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The 2004 Tsunami Story**: Used to illustrate the Second Noble Truth (the cause of suffering is ignorance). The tourists, ignorant of the coming danger and greedy for beach time, stayed and suffered. The elephants, attentive to the signals in their feet, moved to safety. The story emphasizes that suffering arises from internal ignorance, not external events.
    > *"all the elephants headed for the hills, but all the humans... stayed on the beach... because they were not paying attention. They were ignorant."*

2.  **The Skier and Gasoline Explosion**: Used to contrast extreme, dramatic **suffering** with the Buddhist concept of **Dukkha** (dissatisfaction). The story clarifies that Dukkha is not just about catastrophic events but the subtle unsatisfactoriness in any moment.
    > *"the skier who's skiing down the hill... runs into... high-octane gasoline that explodes... Now that's suffering, right? But that's not what Dukkha is all about."*

3.  **The Buddhist Door-to-Door (Hypothetical)**: A humorous hypothetical story to critique the misapplication of the word "suffering." It shows how leading with "solving your suffering" can be alienating because people don't identify with that label, even while displaying it (e.g., anger).
    > *"can you imagine a Buddhist going from door to door giving out pamphlets saying, 'We're going to solve your suffering,' and as the door slammed, the guy says, I'm not suffering, as he says in an angry tone..."*

4.  **The Kid with a Broken Arm**: Used to explain the value of stillness in healing—both physical and mental. Just as moving a broken arm prevents healing, a busy, grasping mind prevents peace. This supports the argument for learning to slow down and stop mental agitation.
    > *"a kid who breaks his arm... if the kid really wants his arm to heal, he needs to hold that hand still."*

5.  **The Underground Utility Map**: A specific example of the "map vs. territory" metaphor. It shows that maps (concepts) are useful only in context and are not the reality itself—they lack dynamic, real-time information and can be useless if you don't already know your location in reality.

**In summary**, the speaker uses **metaphors of burden, avoidance, and misdirection** (rabbit holes, heavy bags, dog turds, wrong maps) to critique common practices. They use **metaphors of immediacy and simplicity** (shrugging off the burden, not stepping in turds) to advocate for their method. The **stories** provide concrete, often dramatic, examples to separate cultural misconceptions from what they argue are the Buddha's core, practical teachings.
