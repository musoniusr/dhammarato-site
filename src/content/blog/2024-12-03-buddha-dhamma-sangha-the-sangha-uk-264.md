### Transcript


**Speaker A:** The video recorder on. So today I would like to make a general announcement. It's Sunday afternoon, uh, what, November the 3rd. And that, as you guys know, I was in the hospital for 9 days in July and managed to convince the doctor to let me out of there before the bill went sky high. And so I crawled home and kind of recovered for a couple of months. But then in October, I kind of lost it. And what it is, is a feeling of general weakness, of not being, for instance, not able to walk. I'm using a walker. I've had the walker before and been able to stop using the walker. But now when I'm walking with the walker, I'm almost completely dependent upon it, as opposed to carrying it in front of me in case I might use it, which has been the way that it's been before. And so I don't spend a lot of time getting up. But the good part, the good news is, is that With nothing to do and no place to go, literally, I'm enjoying the heck out of no place to go and nothing to do. That finally, after all of these years, I'm beginning to take my own advice quite literally. And this seems to have been a good enough time for it. Because we've gotten a Sangha going. We've got several volunteers that are willing to do stuff. Mikey would be top brand on that. He's living here at the house and kind of managing the website and kind of managing, in fact, actually managing the YouTube channel. And that we've gotten several other friends who are beginning to take calls basically from new students, as well as just keeping the Sangha going. That's the only desire that I have left, is that the Sangha does not belly up. Because my belly is up. That what I want is that I want people to continue to talk with each other, to continue to have Sangha. And that's noble Sangha in the sense of having a place where you can actually talk to people in the Noble Dhamma. Now, I know that we've got some friends who come on and give us a lot of their past, a lot of their ordinary Dharma, and we need to allow them to do that and continue to moving things back to the Noble Dhamma, which is basically everything is already okay. We don't need this and we don't need that. What we really need to do is to clean out our mind and let things be okay the way they are. This is the real teaching of the Buddha. The real teaching of the Buddha is to see our disappointments, our disgust, our dislikes, our desire, our demands, to see them rather than having them ignorantly, because when we can see them, we then have a choice about what we're going to do about it. That's the real teaching of the Dharma, as opposed to things like ancient Jewish history, which basically is just old stories about old dead people who didn't become happy practicing what they were practicing. And so old Jewish histories, old Christian histories, old psychology— none of that is of any real value. What's of value is to see the thoughts that you're having right this very minute and to make a change. And we practice that over and over and over again. Why? Because we built up such momentum, such habit patterns of having unwholesome thoughts based upon wants and desires and demands and have-to-haves and dislikes and disgust and all of that. And start enjoying your life moment by moment. The more moments you spend enjoying your life, the more happy you will be in general, as well as the more happy you'll be right now. And it's always about right now. And so this is what I would recommend that we practice, and we practice this together. Not necessarily always in seclusion. You have to get secluded away from the world, the world of the unwholesome. But once we get away from that world and start practicing wholesomely, now is the time to come back and practice together wholesomely, to start having wholesome relationships with wholesome friends. To talk about happiness and talk about everything is already okay. No need for this and no need for that. And so this is about the only desire that I have left, is that all of these hundreds of students who have called me and talked to me over time continue to call each other and talk to each other And we have ways of doing that. We have Skype and we have the Open Sangha Foundation website. We have Discord. And what I would recommend is that if you're posting on Skype, whenever you post on Skype, also move over to the Open Sangha Foundation and post the same thing. In one of the groups, add a new group, add topics, and start putting stuff there. There's one thing that's very interesting, and that is, is that the logs show that people are joining on a regular basis. Every day we have 1, 2, or 3 or 4 new people who are joining the website. But no one, especially of the old group, is communicating with them, is saying, hi, how are you? Sending them messages or anything. And this would be something that someone could take on as a kind of happy task, is to see when new people join the Sangha, send them a message. Saying, 'I'm glad to see you.' Open a dialogue, communicate with each other. So I would say spend a little bit of time every day on Skype and a little bit of time every day on Open Sangha Foundation. A lot of you don't even know how rich the thing is. It's absolutely rich. We have dozens if not hundreds of PDF files, and we have hundreds and hundreds of links. We have videos and video links and all kinds of stuff for you to investigate. We've got a huge library, and part of the library is our Google Drive. Which is an even more vast library. And so if you're into reading, we've got Buddhist literature for you to read. All you have to do is learn the website. And so this is what I would recommend that you do, and do it in the spirit of Dhammarato but not necessarily with his body looking over your shoulder. I remember very well part of the— they did a video on the death of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. And by the way, that video is on our website, and I would highly recommend everybody view that video where A portion of the video talks about that Buddhadasa does not die, that he just goes off into nature somehow and is still all around us. And I feel that very true, that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, the spirit of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, is very alive and very well in Thailand. I think that David has gotten a huge dose of that too. What do you think about that? Okay, so in that same tradition and in that same lineage, let's do this also with the Dhammarato group. Let's keep the thing alive. Let's keep those friends. If I'm not around and you say, oh, well, Dhammarato is not around, 'Never mind, I'll just go off and play tiddlywinks or something,' then you've lost the Dhamma right then and there. But if you say, 'Oh, well, Dhammarato is not around, but boy, he left me a lot of friends to play with. Let me go play with all of the friends that he's left me,' then that's the right attitude. And so this is kind of what I have to say. And so I would reckon now I would like people to join in and conversation to start talking. David, why don't you take over for a little while?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, great to see you back in good health, at least.

**Speaker A:** Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Sorry, I'm not sure what did you want the topic to be here?

**Speaker A:** Well, I want it to not be silent. And number 2, to be noble.

**Speaker C:** Dhammarato, what are you trying to tell us? Are you telling us that you're finishing up or something?

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker C:** What are you trying to tell us? It's a bit upsetting.

**Speaker A:** All right, I'll put it as simply as I can. I'm dying. And I'm going to do it happily whether you like it or not. And it also may take me a while to do that. 6 or 7 or 8 years or so will be fine. Maybe 25 years, who knows? But it's definitely in progress. Carl, good to see you. Thanks for turning your camera on. Since David went silent Let me hear it from you, what you got to say.

**Speaker D:** I don't have much to say. About the website, I have a few questions because I got on the website and it looks good as far as that. And you said a lot about like PDF files and a lot of information to read. But what I see from nowadays, people who are really interested at least in Dharma, they want it quick dosages of it. That's why like YouTube videos were such a great thing, because you can put it in the background and listen to it. So most people unconsciously or consciously are listening to what you're saying. At least that's what worked for me in the beginning. So I found the video format to be the most useful as far as like going deeper into the Dharma, into like reading suttas, into going PDFs, communicating with people. I find there's a huge disinterest of like of wanting to do that because the personal practice is already quite a lot.

**Speaker A:** That's all there is to it anyway. I don't necessarily recommend that people read suttas. In fact, our sutta page is relatively short. Most of it's from just stuff that we've gotten from the Anguttara Nikaya. Leaving the other websites, we do have actual links. So if you want Sutra Central and you don't know how to find it, they're in our library. We've got all of those links to all of those places that has all of that reading, because you'd be surprised at how addicted so many Westerners are to reading. Where in fact the only book that they really need to read is the one between their ears. How many times you've heard that one?

**Speaker D:** Yes, and for some reason it takes somebody, it takes like somebody who says, I have qualifications in teaching Dhamma, I've been a monk, I've been in the Dharma for this long. It takes that person for them to be like, oh yeah, he knows what he's talking about. Meanwhile, somebody comes in who's been in the Dharma maybe for 10 years or 15 years and hasn't been a monk, has been living a layman life, has the Noble Dharma, but it's not going to click the same way. I find it doesn't click. People need that authority figure, like telling the doctor for them to stop eating donuts. It's the same thing. They need that authority for some reason for the Dharma even to click.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so many people do need a daddy to spank them. But we've got a big daddy who does quite a lot of spanking, and we still don't learn the lessons that daddy's trying to teach us. And what is another word for this daddy I'm talking about? Reality. Reality is constantly spanking us, telling us to wake up, look at what's going on, see what you're doing. And yet most people They'll put their head back in the book and not listen, not wake up, not see what's going on around them. This is part of the reason why we need to have that Sangha that I'm talking about, that group of people who keep reminding each other to pay attention to what Daddy is saying, to pay attention to reality.

**Speaker D:** That's true, but as far as like new people, what do you see attracts them here is usually the name of like either Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, either Dhammarato, either Ajahn Chah. It's not— somebody has to have like almost a name built up in the community for them to be attracted to that group of people.

**Speaker A:** All right, let's take it from there then. If the name Dhammarato means enough to people where they're going to call and want to talk to Dhammarato, then people like Alex and Mikey and Anna and several others can then call and talk to that person saying, hey, Dhammarato is feeling like shit, but I'll be willing to talk to you. And then start a friendship right then and there, because that's what it's all about. The Dhamma is all about friendship. There's actually a sutta by the name, surprisingly, as the Hat Sutta. It's in the Samyutta Nikaya, and there Ananda comes from Sariputta tells the Buddha that Sariputra just told me that friendship is half the Dhamma. And the Buddha mused about that for a second and he says, oh no, it's 100%. It's all. It's all Dhamma. It's all the Dhamma is friendship. And so You can actually have a guru, but if you have no relationship to that guru, you're probably not going to learn anything from that guru. And if you have a teacher that you have a close relationship with, but that teacher is an ordinary person, then you're unlikely to get anything much out of it in the long haul. I've seen clear evidence of that within the Western Sangha, that some of the old monks, Western monks, never got what the Buddha was talking about at all. They've just become old monks, but they've got quite a following. And guess where he's leading that following? Is back into the ordinary world. So I would rather have a noble friend who has not been noble long and is still practicing noble, practicing noble on me. Because while he's practicing noble on me, I'm absorbing noble right then and there. And I'll just as likely listen to a friend as I would to some schmuck who calls himself a teacher. And believe me, there's an awful lot of people in the West who claim that they are Buddhist teachers and they do not spread the Noble Dharma. And one of the easy ways to see it is that they're not trying to build Sangha. They're trying to build their wallet. And when someone is trying to build up their wallet, they are not trying to build up Sangha. It's like, oh, A, give me money and I'll teach you Dhamma. B, give me money and I'll teach you Dhamma. But the real noble way is, hey, A, meet B. Make friends with him and talk Noble Dharma together. And that's what we're all about, is let's build Sangha. It may take a little extra effort, and in fact, that's part of the Eightfold Noble Path, is taking right noble effort. Take right noble effort to teach each other and stay noble. And in fact, that's something that I see quite often, is that the monks will be noble perhaps with each other, but as soon as they start talking to a layperson, they get all ignoble again. Rather than speaking only in noble terms. And what would be those noble terms? Everything's okay, everything is fine. Yeah, you, you want to talk to me about the fight that you had with your wife? I don't want to listen to the fight that you had with your wife. I want you to stop fighting with your wife. Just stop. Be happy and be noble with her, and then you won't have to talk to me about your stupid arguments. Just shut your face. That's what a noble would tell an ordinary person. But look at what happens at the psychology office— that the husband or the wife goes in and wants to talk for an hour about the argument that they had with their wife. And guess what? That psychologist will bring up his cash register every time. So that's the issue, is that we need to start sharing the noble Dharma with one another, practice doing that. Does that make sense to you, Carl? It does.

**Speaker D:** And I, I can say I have many students in my life, as far as myself as student and many students in my life who I do practice Dharma with, and they tend to be like lay people. There isn't much need for— I mean, there isn't always need for a noble Dharma, and you can see in their eyes that what they're looking for is noble Dharma, but yet they're constantly getting stuck into more of these more popular, I guess, streams of spirituality, or what you want to call it, like the westernized spirituality, which is big business, right? It's a club, you pay a fee to enter, and then you might get exposed to Noble Dharma, you might not. It depends who you meet, it depends who's part of that group. You might get lucky, you might not get lucky. Meanwhile, here we have one team, and that one team is getting maintained throughout the whole conversation. It's always just about the Noble Dharma, and as soon as we see people get off that path going back into their questions, doubts, ways, we always put them back on the path, we always put them back on the Noble Dharma.

**Speaker A:** We always— Yes, exactly.

**Speaker E:** Right, yeah.

**Speaker D:** Well, I practice that in my life. I try to put as much Noble Dharma into people as much as they can eat. Obviously you have to put a little spoon of of like a little, a little, a little drop of like a medicine, right? It's just a little drop at first, and then it gets more and more and more.

**Speaker A:** And that drop of medicine is a drop right now, and more and more and more is just yet another drop right now. And then later, just another drop right now, and then a little later, another drop right now. And the more Nows that you have, the more drops you'll have. So that's the way to look at it, is that things are going to give you a drop of medicine every time you think about it in a noble way. But it's so easy to go back to the old way of thinking. Because everybody around you does. Our society teaches us that things are screwed up and they need to be fixed. I mean, look at American politics right now. They've really convinced themselves that things are either screwed up or about to get really screwed up, and everybody is in a tizzy. And very few people on the internet that I've seen is coming in saying, hey guys, chill out. It doesn't matter which one of those politicians wins the presidency. The question is, are you going to be happy anyway? It's not up to the President of the United States to make a world good enough for you to be happy in. The question is, can you make a world good enough for you to be happy in? And can you spread that world to others?

**Speaker D:** There is a lot like another thing I notice in the West. I live in London, so I noticed in the city there's this distrust when you offer friendship for free. There's a distrust in people's eyes that they're like, Wait, you want to be my friend? What do you get out of it? You know, that kind of attitude is always like a worried attitude towards you. Meanwhile, in Thailand, you don't sense that with people. People are more open to immediately receive you because friendship is almost like ingrained there from the early days. I mean, it's not as competitive a society as as here in the West. So that also gets in the way of teaching Dharma because friendship is the way, but people don't even want to get to that level of friendship in the beginning. It's almost like if you're trying to be their friend, they're very suspicious of you. They become like, why are you giving me this love? Why are you listening to me? Why are you just nodding and not going with me into my Dukkha and going, oh yeah, right, yeah, yeah, let's gossip about that person. So there's that kind of distrust. It's almost like you have to go down to the Dukkha to build friendship, which is a stupid way of going about it. And then you can maybe— Well, how.

**Speaker A:** Do you answer that? Here's a point that we can talk on for a minute. How do you handle that when they are either with their stares or their glares or their words are telling you, how dare you want to make friends with me? What do you want? How are you going to answer that?

**Speaker D:** I answer the same way within myself. I answer, it's okay, there's nothing to worry. It's okay as long as I'm calm, and I try to bring the calmness into them, and hopefully that rubs off eventually on them. I mean, I can't do much if they're not willing to practice themselves. I can only practice myself and hopefully that rubs off at that moment. And then eventually they will ask you a question, "Why are you so calm? Why are you smiling all the time? Why are you this?" And then maybe you can slip in a bit of Dharma. That's how it usually goes.

**Speaker A:** That's exactly right. Sometimes it takes that long, slow time. Very rarely is it worthwhile saying actually something. But if you were going to say something, you could say something like, I don't want anything. I've already got everything that I want. I don't want anything. I want nothing. Maybe I can help you want nothing, and then we can really be friends. So that's the way of addressing it. You've got it right, is that When people are wary of you, they're not wary of you. They're wary of everything that they've ever heard before. They're wary of society. They're wary of you because they know that their government hires thugs, dress them in special uniforms, and put them out on the street to be bullies. The national bully system. It's called police, and they want those bullies out there to prevent people like you from being happy and wanting nothing. And so everybody believes that everybody wants something. I've even heard it in the expression of everybody's got a price. Everybody's got a price. Yeah, I've got a price. My price is $0. That's my price. I'm cheap. So David, do you have anything to offer yet?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we should spread the word to others. We should make connections in the Dharma. We should build our Sangha. We should make friendship important. Is important to have friends in the Dharma.

**Speaker A:** And so what we've done over the past several months and years is to develop some web tools to do that so that we can have not just local Sanghas to where you have to travel to Timbuktu and join Timbuktu Monastery in order to find Sangha. Now it's available online. I can see 15, 20 years from now where our Sangha has 30,000, 40,000 people in it, all chit-chatting with each other. Well, hello Thomas, glad to see you.

**Speaker D:** I think the need for the Sangha was the highest during the COVID Like that was probably the biggest boom you can see, like people who are into Dharma during COVID they really got into like this online thing. And I don't know how many phone calls you had during 2020? During those years when COVID was going, I think you noticed that there was a higher appetite for the Dharma. Well, mainly because of the circumstances that were going, a lot of fear and a lot of uncertainty and everyone.

**Speaker A:** Guess what? COVID didn't cause the fear and uncertainty. And when COVID went away, It didn't take that fear and uncertainty with it. That fear and uncertainty is part of our culture, not part of an epidemic.

**Speaker D:** But it was highlighted. It was very highlighted because you couldn't escape it. Now you're in a shoebox of your apartment room, I don't know, private house, and it's very highlighted because you can't distract yourself from it now. And it's being in your face all the time, on the news, on the TV, on the radio, on the internet. I was thinking that was probably the peak of like building Sangha online and building friendship online.

**Speaker A:** Well, we were certainly doing that then. We hadn't gotten this far along with the website, but the website was already in plans. Before COVID It just took a while, mostly because it was all volunteer and that some of the action was slow. In fact, I didn't even start coding until May of 2023. And so that's where the website really took off. Was because of that. And so now it's got every bell and every whistle. You could go so far as to call it the Buddhist Facebook. Nobles. So Luke, do you have anything to say?

**Speaker E:** Hi Dhammarato, not a huge amount. I've been— I was lucky enough to have a call with Alex the other day, had a one-on-one conversation with him, which was really good. It was really nice to talk to him. We had a really nice chat. And Mikey too, a few weeks ago I had a good chat with. So I feel like, yeah, that I've definitely been able to connect with people, you know, part of this, part of this Sangha. And yeah, I already feel a connection with everyone, and it's been nice to get to know people and share Dharma and inspire each other.

**Speaker A:** It's been great.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, so thank you, Dhammarato. You started all this, so thank you.

**Speaker A:** Yes, all I did was kick a stone down a hill. Let us hope that this becomes a bigger snowball and eventually an avalanche.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, for sure.

**Speaker A:** In fact, I did a lot of kicking on that snowball. So, Dean, where are you? Are you still listening?

**Speaker C:** Well, Dhammarato, yeah, I'm still here. I'm still listening.

**Speaker A:** Do you have anything to comment on?

**Speaker C:** I know it's just a bit upsetting, like, which sort of is what it is, you know.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker C:** It looks like, uh, um, I'd say I'll be coming to Thailand a bit sooner than I thought. I might be able to see.

**Speaker A:** You. So, okay, well, the, the story or the teaching of having wholesome thoughts, that's the Dhamma. Then Buddha is having those wholesome thoughts, and then Sangha is sharing those wholesome thoughts. This is the Triple Gem: Buddha, Dharma, Sangha. And that's about as simple as I can put it, is that when you are having wholesome thoughts, you're the Buddha. Right then and there, you're awake to what you're thinking, and what you're thinking is wholesome. So this is the whole show right then and there, is to remember to have wholesome thoughts and to share them with others. This has been the whole teaching since We got started on the internet in 2016. I think we've got videos that go back that far, but they really got started in October 2018 when Skype started allowing us to record the videos inside of Skype. And so this is what I would try to depart with you guys, is to remember to have wholesome thoughts and to share those thoughts with others. We do that, we'll be fine. If you do that by yourself, you will have a marvelous life for the rest of your life. And if you do that with others, you will be sharing and helping them to have a healthy, happy life also. Arahant, do you have something to say?

**Speaker C:** What?

**Speaker F:** I'm just very happy. I'm really happy that I have discovered your videos. It's like 2 or 3 weeks ago, for the first time I saw one of your videos, and ever since, every day I've been watching at least 2, 3 some days, and practicing, practicing. I've already had a call with Mikey, I've had 2 calls with Alexander, I've been messaging with David, and so I'm trying to be in the Sangha and practicing and Yeah, I'm just very happy. I feel a lot of sadness and a lot of unhappiness, but that is for me things to practice with.

**Speaker A:** And yeah, that's probably based in regret. Well, don't have— don't right now have regrets about what you didn't do in the past. Right now, forget about the past and be happy now.

**Speaker F:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** Forget about the past.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, I'm very much in the habit of trying to heal the past or trying to, you know, fix the past instead of just being happy right now and letting the past take care of itself, which, which it already has done, of course.

**Speaker A:** So Mikey, why don't you take over for a little while?

**Speaker G:** Sure. So yeah, it's worthwhile to spread the Dharma. We can say this is true on the inside and this is also true on the outside. Spread Dharma on the inside of the mind, we spread Dharma with friends. And one thing I would like to encourage is staying away from any sort of guru worshiping. One thing that's very beneficial is to talk with friends in the Sangha about Dharma, regardless of how well practiced they are. If they don't have that much practice and you have more practice than them, that's a chance for you to sort of teach them, but you'll also learn while you're teaching them. You know, when we talk about the Dhamma, it just kind of reverberates around the room, around the mind.

**Speaker A:** Piling on is another way of saying that. Yeah, piling on. The more you talk about the Dhamma to other people, the more you're talking about the Dhamma to yourself too.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, yeah, it's nice. It feels nice to talk about it. It pleases the body, it pleases the mind.

**Speaker F:** Dhammarato, can I say something? Sorry, can I have a question about it? I have done a few going of Vipassana retreats, and in that they recommend to not talk about your experiences, about your meditation experiences with other students.

**Speaker A:** There is A reason for that in a limited context, and that reason is, is that when people are doing a retreat, they will often have weird experiences floating off into space, going into some sort of self-created heaven or self-created hell. And the beginning students always think it is important, it is valuable, and it's meaningful that they had some meditation experience. That in fact, that seems to be the reason why people are attracted to Eastern meditation in the first place, is they're not looking at it for the real benefit. They're looking at it for the experience without recognizing that every minute, every second, we're having another experience, a new experience. Let's have a new experience right now, never mind some spectacular experience. Now, the next point is, is that if people in those groups or those retreats have a spectacular experience, and they tell the people around them, then those people want that experience too. And so now they're in Dukkha. Oh, I want that experience Tommy had. And then they're not practicing at all correctly. They're practicing according to their desires. And so in a retreat, that injunction has some limited value. But people take it way too far. That in fact, one of the problems that I see with the Goenka, and I have seen it since the very beginning, and to make sure that you understand, I spent many, many months with Goenka. I traveled with him all over India. I did dozens of retreats, 10-day 20-day, 30-day, all of that kind of stuff. This was back in the 1980s, early 1980s, when they still had— in fact, I remember when they got the first VCR, and so they started taping his tapes, VCR. Then eventually they went digital and started doing with the videos. Now, one of the problems with the Goenka is that he never tried to build Sangha. He wanted to be the guru. He was Indian. He wanted to be the chief and 10 little Indians around him, or 100,000 little Indians. He didn't want a Sangha at all. And because of that, the Goenka system is not a Sangha. You don't have a dozen different teachers within the tradition of Goenka. You've got only volunteers who play his tapes. And so I would say offhand that while there's an awful lot of people who appreciate Goenka, the whole system is doomed to failure simply because it Number 1, has no lineage. What is the lineage is that it's passed down from what we do know for sure, from Vedi Sarada down to Upadana and then Goenka. But after that, the lineage stops. There is no lineage after that. So what are they going to do in the year 2525? They're still going to be playing Goenka's tapes, play his CDs. Is that what they're intending to do? And not only that, but it's a really important issue, and that is, is that when people do a Goenka retreat, the best joy they have is when the retreat is over. Wow, what a relief! I know, but they don't teach people to have joy right on day one and let that joy build.

**Speaker F:** That's exactly the thing. I have done it a few times, but it did not change the way I think. You know, I have still the same mind that I had before. I could sit very still for a few hours. I can do that. But from inside, I'm still the unhappy, the still not the wholesome thoughts. That thing for me is new now since I've—.

**Speaker A:** You're right in the sense that the Goenka system is also incomplete to where the teaching of the Buddha is about all four aspects of the body, the feeling, the mental states, and the mental objects, to where Goenka is mostly focused on the body. So people learn to sit still. But is their body really relaxed? Are they kind of forcing? Is it a kind of rigidity, etc., like that? Because their mind is still agitated. And so if somebody has signed up for a Goenka retreat and talks to me about it, the answer that I will give them is, oh, make these few changes while you're doing the retreat. But if somebody comes and asks me, oh, there's a Goenka retreat coming up, should I sign up for it? My answer would definitely be no.

**Speaker F:** For me too. I think, to be honest, I think the only benefit to it is just being away. I was thinking just being away 10 days, 10 days away from your wife or 10 days away from your job, that alone has some benefits to it.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker F:** 10 days away from your normal life. So I see a benefit in that. But more than that, I will never do it again. For me, I will definitely never do it again.

**Speaker A:** All right. That leads me then back to the teaching of the Buddha, where he says, go to the forest, go to the foot of a tree, go to an empty hut or even a pile of straw and sit down. And bring mindfulness to the fore. Now, what mindfulness to the fore means is start looking at what you're doing, start being here in the here-now. So in that regard, people would probably get better results if they bought themselves several hundred dollars worth of camping gear and went out into the woods alone and just go out into the woods and just hang out for 10 days. They get a whole lot more benefit out of doing that than they would doing a Goenka retreat. Ah, but so many says, where's the guru in the woods? I want a guru. And the answer to that is the world doesn't need another guru. I mean, look how many gurus we've had over the centuries. We've had Socrates and we've had Marcus Aurelius and we've had the Stoics and we've had Jesus. And what have we gotten ourselves? Even the Buddha. Nobody listens to what the Buddha says. They're too busy being little Buddhists or little Christians, being still a follower. Where the Buddha talks about, become a lion under yourself. Know your own mind, take control of your own mind. And therefore, the noble friends that you have will be noble friends Noble because they have a strong mind. They're not sucking up to you because they want something, but rather they're joyfully sharing what they have already. So in a way, you could say all of the world's religions, even Buddhism, is a royal failure. If— look at how many religions that we've got and how many people are in those religions. And if Islam or Christianity was working, wouldn't we have a happy world?

**Speaker F:** I was also thinking, sorry, how many people have they produced that are enlightened? None, or at least very few, maybe.

**Speaker A:** Well, the problem with the enlightened ones, fully enlightened ones, is that they go off and forget about the world. They don't— the fully enlightened ones are unlikely to take students. But the Buddha was kind of special because he knew that if he didn't teach, nobody would teach. And so he taught for the benefit of future generations. And so keep that in mind when you're teaching. You're not teaching to just one person. You're teaching for the benefit of humanity. They're teaching for the benefit of further generations. And slowly the Dhamma is going to sink in. Right now, I would say it's at the level of about 0.01%. About 99.9% of the people don't get it. But look how many people have gotten it. That I have heard, and this was information that was 40, 50 years old, that there was like 25,000 nobles in Thailand. And I've met quite a few of them. And so recognizing that there are nobles and you start practicing being noble, one noble thought at a time, and pretty soon that kind of builds up. Go ahead, Mikey.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, and being in Sangha, making friends just makes it easier and easier.

**Speaker A:** Because we're putting more and more mind moments in it.

**Speaker G:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** David, is that chicken? Uh, Achan Chow's chicken?

**Speaker B:** There's so many roosters here. It's crazy how loud they are. They're just all over the place. They poop everywhere.

**Speaker A:** You know how to handle those roosters?

**Speaker B:** No, how?

**Speaker A:** Stop beating the dogs.

**Speaker G:** Arahant.

**Speaker A:** That was the mistake that they made at Wat Suwan Mokkh is some head monk that took over for a little while saying, we've got too many chickens, we've got too many dogs, let's solve the problem by stop feeding the dogs. Guess what? There are no chickens at Wat Suwan Mokkh, and there's no dogs there either. But in the time of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, the place was overrun with both chickens and dogs.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, even now it still is though. This time there's still chickens, many dogs there.

**Speaker A:** So anyway, back to you, Mikey.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, I'm not sure I have much else to say. Other than, yeah, just stay in Sangha, keep making friends. And yeah, as Dhammarato says, it's rare to encounter people who will really get the Noble Dhamma in the real world. But when you come back into Sangha, you'll find there's plenty of people that get it and rejoice in talking about it. And Also, I did want to say that it's a fun game. I've found for some people, myself included, whenever first talking about the Dhamma, it's like, oh, not sure what words to use, and that can feel frustrating and this sort of thing. But yeah, just see it as a game to play and don't have to worry too much about saying it perfectly because you're not going to get it perfectly anyways.

**Speaker A:** Actually, coming out of perfection is one of the— Right. There is no such thing as perfection. There is no such thing as all noble all the time unless one is in seclusion. So if you're dealing with the world, even when you're having noble-mindedness, you're going to have to wind up making some choices about ordinary stuff. For instance, you can't walk into the bank and do banking business with a complete 100% noble mind, because the only— the only thing that you can do in the bank with a completely noble mind is Why am I here? And then you leave. But you can take your noble mind into the bank and do some ordinary business and sign some papers and do this transaction and that transaction quite happily. And if the bank clerk doesn't want to do it the way you wanted to do it, you can handle her or him quite happily. Because you do have a noble mind, but you sometimes have to do ordinary business, and that's okay. Become aware of the distinction between is the mind being noble right in this present moment, or is it being ordinary in this present moment? And then if you say, oh, bad me, oh, I was not noble for a second, That old bad me, that's definitely the worst kind of ordinary. It in fact is possibly a good point to make again is that there are three views or three ways of looking at it. One is noble, the other one is with right ordinary view, and then there is wrong view. Punishing yourself for having right ordinary view is definitely wrong view. But recognizing, "Oh, that was ordinary right view there for a moment," then that thought becomes a noble thought again. So does anybody else have any questions or any points to make? I've about had it up to here. Any final comments? Thank you for the teachings.

**Speaker F:** Come on, Jesse, maybe something about your health. Will you go back to the hospital.

**Speaker C:** Or what is the next step?

**Speaker A:** I'm thinking more in line of having, finding a doctor who could do a home visit. Visit and come here and draw blood and take it and have it analyzed or whatever like that. Right now I'm not on any medication at all, and I'm sure that there could be some medications that would help, but a hospitalization I don't think is the right idea. I could be lazy in bed. All right, so Mikey, why don't you finish this off now?

**Speaker G:** Yeah, so for anyone watching or listening to this online, to— on the Dhammarato YouTube channel, check the video description. We have 3 Skype groups now. We have the Sangha UK and the Sangha US, which is where we do group calls, and then there's also a one-on-one Dhamma calls Skype group. You can join that to speak with seasoned practitioners. There are even monks in that group that you can talk about the Dhamma with. And we of course also have Dhamma Friends Discord that you can join, and obviously opensanghafoundation.org, which has a huge database of teachers, students, wats, facilities that you can practice at, and all sorts of.

**Speaker A:** Resources and good search systems.

**Speaker G:** Yes. So go ahead and check all that out, and thank you everyone for being here today.

**Speaker E:** Thank you.

**Speaker F:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Thank you all. I very much appreciate you being my friends.

**Speaker E:** You too, Dhammarato.

**Speaker G:** All right, take care everyone.

**Speaker E:** Arahant. Hi, guys.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends, centers on three interconnected themes: **Dhammarato's health and legacy, the crucial importance of Sangha (spiritual community), and the core practice of Noble Dhamma.**

Here is a summary of the key points:

### 1. **Dhammarato's Health and Transition**
Dhammarato announces he is in declining health, using a walker and feeling weak. He openly states, "I'm dying," but emphasizes he is doing so happily. His primary concern is not his health, but ensuring the **Sangha he helped build continues without him.** He urges the community not to depend on his physical presence but to rely on each other, comparing his ongoing spirit to that of the late teacher Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, who remains a living inspiration.

### 2. **The Centrality of Sangha and Friendship**
The talk's core message is that **friendship (kalyāṇamittatā) is not just part of the path—it *is* the path.** Dhammarato stresses:
*   The community must become self-sustaining. Veteran students should welcome newcomers, make friends, and support each other.
*   He has built online tools (Open Sangha Foundation website, Skype groups, Discord) to facilitate this global, accessible Sangha, calling it a "Buddhist Facebook for Nobles."
*   The goal is to create a space where people talk to each other about Dhamma, not just to a teacher. He criticizes systems (like Goenka's) or teachers that focus on a central guru or finances instead of building genuine, peer-based community.

### 3. **The Practice of Noble Dhamma**
Dhammarato defines the essence of practice simply:
*   **Core Teaching:** "Everything is already okay." The practice is to clean out the mind and see our desires, dislikes, and disappointments clearly. When we see them, we have a choice.
*   **Method:** Cultivate **wholesome thoughts** in the present moment. "The more moments you spend enjoying your life, the happier you will be."
*   **Contrast with "Ordinary" Dhamma:** He distinguishes "Noble Dhamma" from "ordinary" spiritual talk. Noble Dhamma constantly returns to the theme that happiness is possible now, without needing anything external. It avoids getting lost in past stories, psychology, or "ancient Jewish history."
*   **Application in Society:** He uses the example of political anxiety to illustrate that happiness doesn't depend on external circumstances but on our internal response. A noble friend reminds others of this.

### 4. **Practical Advice for the Community**
*   **Engage with the Platforms:** Use the Open Sangha Foundation website, Skype, and Discord actively. The website is a rich resource with PDFs, links, and a library.
*   **Reach Out:** When new people join, veteran students should greet them and start a dialogue.
*   **Teach Each Other:** Everyone, regardless of experience, can share Noble Dhamma. Teaching reinforces the practice for oneself.
*   **Avoid Guru Worship:** The spirit of the teaching is what matters, not attachment to a single person. The lineage continues through shared practice and friendship.

### 5. **Dialogue with Sangha Members**
The conversation includes others who:
*   Share their positive experiences connecting with Sangha friends.
*   Discuss challenges in teaching Dhamma in the West, where people may be distrustful of free friendship or overly reliant on authority figures.
*   Critique other meditation systems (specifically Goenka retreats) for being incomplete, overly focused on experiences, and lacking in Sangha-building.
*   Reaffirm the importance of practicing calm and wholesomeness as an example that eventually inspires questions and openness in others.

**Conclusion:** The talk is a heartfelt passing of the torch. Dhammarato's final wish is for the community to sustain itself through **wholesome friendship and continuous practice of Noble Dhamma—remembering that "everything is already okay" in the present moment.** The tools are in place; the responsibility now lies with the Sangha to connect, support each other, and keep the teachings alive.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several **metaphors** and references a few key **stories** to illustrate his teachings about the Dhamma, community (Sangha), and his own situation.

### **Metaphors**

1.  **"Belly up" / "My belly is up":** He plays on the idiom "to belly up" (meaning to fail or go bankrupt). He says his only desire is that the Sangha does not "belly up," then adds humorously and poignantly, "Because my belly is up," referring to his own physical decline and impending death.

2.  **Daddy/Reality Spanking:** He criticizes the need for an external authority figure (guru) by saying, "so many people do need a daddy to spank them." He then redefines this "daddy" as **Reality itself**, which is "constantly spanking us, telling us to wake up, look at what's going on." This metaphor presents life's difficulties as a form of corrective, teaching feedback.

3.  **"A drop of medicine":** When discussing how to teach the Noble Dhamma to others, a student says you have to give it in small doses, "a little drop of like a medicine at first." Dhammarato extends the metaphor, saying each "drop" is a moment of noble thought ("a drop right now"), and healing comes from accumulating these present-moment "drops."

4.  **Kicking a Stone/Snowball/Avalanche:** To describe his role in starting the community, he says, "all I did was kick a stone down a hill." He then hopes it becomes "a bigger snowball and eventually an avalanche." This metaphor illustrates a small initial action leading to an unstoppable, growing movement.

5.  **"The only book... is the one between their ears":** He dismisses over-reliance on texts by saying the only essential "book" is one's own mind. This metaphor emphasizes introspection over intellectual study.

6.  **"The national bully system":** He uses this provocative metaphor for the police to explain societal distrust, suggesting institutional forces condition people to believe everyone wants something and to be wary of freely offered friendship.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Death of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa:** He references a video about the death of his teacher, Buddhadasa. The key point from the story is that "Buddhadasa does not die, that he just goes off into nature somehow and is still all around us." He uses this to argue that the *spirit* of the teaching and the teacher outlives the physical body, a model for how his own community should continue after he's gone.

2.  **The Hat Sutta (Upaddha Sutta):** He recounts this story from the Samyutta Nikaya. The disciple Ananda says to the Buddha that Sariputta told him "friendship is half the Dhamma." The Buddha corrects him, saying, "Oh no, it's 100%. It's all. It's all Dhamma." Dhammarato uses this story to ground his entire emphasis on building Sangha and noble friendship in the Buddha's own words.

3.  **Personal Anecdote about Goenka Retreats:** He shares his personal history with S.N. Goenka's Vipassana movement from the 1980s. He tells this story to make several points:
    *   The injunction against discussing meditation experiences has a **limited context** (to prevent desire and comparison in beginners).
    *   The **system is flawed** because it relies on a single guru (Goenka) and his tapes, not a living Sangha or lineage of teachers.
    *   It focuses too much on bodily sensation and endurance, not on cultivating joyful, wholesome thoughts from the start. He concludes that one might get more benefit from simply camping alone in the woods for 10 days.

4.  **Anecdote about Wat Suwan Mokkh's Chickens and Dogs:** He tells a brief, cautionary tale about his teacher's monastery. After Buddhadasa's time, a new head monk decided to solve the "problem" of many animals by stopping feeding the dogs. The result was that the dogs killed all the chickens, and eventually, there were no dogs or chickens left. It's a metaphor for how misguided, heavy-handed solutions can destroy a living ecosystem—paralleling how a community (Sangha) needs natural, supportive care, not controlling management.

### **Overall Purpose**
These metaphors and stories are not just illustrations; they are the core of his pedagogical method. They make the teachings on impermanence, community, self-reliance, and present-moment awareness vivid, memorable, and grounded in both scripture and lived experience. They also soften the delivery of difficult news about his health and frame his impending death not as an end, but as a transition for the community he helped start.
