### Transcript


**Speaker A:** You can't change the outside world, and so in fact, that's what we talk about. I've had many, many people who have seen interviews have complained, "How can you possibly be happy when the children in Yemen are starving, or they're being bombed? What about world hunger?" The answer is, well, the world is going to be hungry whether I'm happy or miserable, you know. So today, by the way, welcome, James. I'm glad to make your friendship, and I hope that we could become good friends.

**Speaker B:** It's a great honor for me, and I'm very, very appreciative of all the good teachings that Okay, you provide.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's it. That's exactly what we're talking about— the myth of all those good teachings. Okay, that's the myth. All those good teachings. In fact, there is only a very small set of teachings that, in order to be understood, need to be looked at from various angles and various points of view. And that we have to take these very, very simple things that we're talking about and apply it to a very complicated human's life. The complexity is the fact that the human has gotten themselves into a great deal of diversity, and so when they see Buddhism, they see just more diversity or just one more thing to throw in the bag.

**Speaker B:** The acquisitional mindset of the Westerner.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, exactly. As opposed to having the mindset of this is in fact directions on how to put a hole in the bottom of your bag, right? These directions don't need to be thrown into the bag the way you throw everything else in. This direction says, hey, take this and that and you put a hole in the bottom of the bag so the stuff begins to leak out.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's the whole teaching of the Buddha that makes it different. And the scholars have known about this, but the practitioners don't. What I mean by the scholars is, is that they know and they talk about that Buddhism is a negative or via negata. Or a subtraction process, right?

**Speaker B:** Taking away.

**Speaker A:** Taking away.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that's all there is to it, is to change that process from adding to into the mindset of taking away. All right. And so the first things that we start taking away is all the troubles, all the problems, and everything like that. And get the mind into a really, really good state.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, gladdening the mind.

**Speaker A:** Gladdening the mind, precisely, which the Buddha would also refer to as taking the right effort to remove unwholesome thoughts, also called hindrances, and place into the mind only wholesome thoughts, one after another after another.

**Speaker B:** Right, Thomas? Thanks. Almost like when you let go of the Dukkha, it pulls you or almost slings you into an exuberant state because you have freedom.

**Speaker A:** Wow, what a relief it is to not have to go to work today in my own mind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** It's a being able to take the day off. Literally, or at least the hour, or maybe the moment. But at least take a moment off. You don't have any jobs to do, no worries to make, no, uh, thoughts to do, no enlightenment to gain, no past life experiences to strive for, nothing. Everything's okay. Just let it go and relax. That's the basic teaching of the Buddha from that to stages of more relaxation, to stages of even more relaxation, to the point that we get down to the point that we're not even processing the data that's coming in through our senses. We're just sitting there in sensory awareness in a state of awe and wonder because we're not trying to make sense out of anything. Yeah, we're in this great sense of well-being because we have dropped away all of the hindrances, all of the thoughts, all of the bad feelings, and are just relaxed.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, a sense of appreciation and gratitude.

**Speaker A:** Appreciation and gratitude and wonder, awe, a feeling of being in the presence of something magnificent. Is happening in a really magnificent way, ongoing. So that's the kind of yes, appreciation, real appreciation for the value of being alive and being able to note the reality of this present instant, this present moment.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, cosmic awe.

**Speaker A:** That's it, that's it. We don't have good language for it. But we're pointing in the direction of how nice one can allow oneself to feel, and that in fact we can talk ourselves into it. And yet most people spend their whole lives seeking that kind of stuff in outside ways, like at football games or pool tables or brothels or all kinds of things. We're looking for the exhilaration of the winning, and we often have to deal with the agony of defeat. The Buddhist method is, let's get rid of and start dealing with these things one at a time, and the first one to go is the agony of defeat, so that we actually do feel the thrill of the win. And after we get that, then we can set that aside too.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's as if Western society has gamified our innate desire, but it's a desire to come back to the self, or to come back to the awe, cosmic awe. And they put a bunch of— think

**Speaker A:** that they're far away from it, or that they have many spiritual practices to do, or they may need to make a whole lot of merit, or something or another is preventing it from happening right now, and it has to be done way off into the future.

**Speaker B:** Right, they create a dissociative state and then try to sell you a cure to get back that innate sense of awe and appreciation.

**Speaker A:** Well, now you're talking about the function of the charlatans. Yeah, the priest, the magician, the sleight-of-hand magicians, the snake handlers.

**Speaker B:** Well, even the bread and circuses that that are there to be a substitute for what you have internally.

**Speaker A:** Oh, you mean like social workers doing the same kind of thing?

**Speaker B:** Anyone trying to sell you something that you think will make you happy.

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm. Oh, well, in that case, then we can bring in the whole show, and that whole show I call the Greb, G-R-E-B, which means Government, religion, education, and business.

**Speaker B:** There you go.

**Speaker A:** Grab, grab. That's the big dudes that are trying to make a profit off of your misery so that if they have enough profit, then they can able then to deal with their own misery. If they go off and deal with their own misery directly, then other people would not be ripped off as well as being miserable.

**Speaker B:** Right. Well, the more miserable the more people are, the higher the demand are the cures for the misery that they present in terms of material things mostly, or drugs.

**Speaker A:** And so the entire professional system then has to do with acknowledging that there's a problem. That needs to be fixed. Yeah. All right, the Buddha has a different philosophy about that. There's no problem, or that you're creating the problem with your unwholesome negative thoughts, right?

**Speaker B:** The dissociative state, your— the divide between yourself and your happiness.

**Speaker A:** All right, so look at what you're doing. Look at the fact that we make ourselves unhappy because we give ourselves work to do. But you see, there is a delusion or fallacy built in there, and that fallacy we can put in the language of several different perspectives. And one of the perspectives is delayed gratification. All right, now delayed gratification has been around for a long time, and in fact you could basically say that this is the old Hindu and now more modern Christian version of God in the sense of the Kamma machine, the delayed gratification. You do good and you will get good results. If you do bad, you will get bad results eventually, so they say. Or the other way of saying it is, no matter what, Right, and heaven

**Speaker B:** and hell are the furthest, are the

**Speaker A:** exact right, exactly the extremes of this whole do good and get good results. But there's a few kickers in there, like forgiveness and mercy and grace and those kinds of things. But basically the old point is, is that you need mercy and grace because of your bad behavior and you're trying to get a way out of it. So now getting the grace is now a good action. That modifies or destroys the bad results that you were going to have coming to you, right?

**Speaker B:** So they implant that disassociative wedge very early on in their theology.

**Speaker A:** Not only is it that way, but we do that with our kids. Yeah, we teach them delayed gratification. Learn your ABCs and know your numbers, know your 1, 2, 3s. Why? Well, if you do that, you can get into the second grade, you could get a graduation, get into second grade. Well, why do I have to third words. Yeah, so you could graduate and get into the third grade, and along the way, many of the kids— but a lot of them don't ever figure out that, hey, wait a minute, this gratification that I had thought was coming is short-lived and inadequate.

**Speaker B:** Right. And it gets you on the treadmill of more and more and more and more. So I got the third grade, where's the 33rd grade? And they don't know when to get off the train.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. And so that's what happens when the guy gets about 40 years old and winds up in the Harley-Davidson dealership. He's still looking for the gratification that he didn't quite get in the first grade.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they promised me gratification, but I never got it.

**Speaker A:** And so I've been— not only that, but all the gratification that I have been looking for has not been exactly that gratifying. Right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** It's not enough. That hardly isn't enough for 20 years in the factory. In other words.

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm. Exactly so. And so we feel ripped off or we have the opinion from childhood of being a victim.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Being ripped off.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Of needing help, needing mercy, needing forgiveness, needing grace. Or needing a mommy somehow or another to come back and start taking care of me, like she did when I was a baby in diapers. She would say, "Goo goo goo ga ga," but by the time I'm 6 years old, she says, "Pick up your toys and clean your room and do your ABCs and put down that cell phone and do your homework." And that's what life becomes for the human being, and deep inside we long for that original state of nurturing and well-being and everything was taken care of. And isn't that a nice fat tit right in front of us with such delicious milk and everything is okay, right?

**Speaker B:** Or the flip side, the anger at being ripped off to want to redress that dissociative state, right?

**Speaker A:** But those feelings, especially that one, is going to prevent us from ever being able to get into that state again. Right, yeah, it is because we're pissed off because we're the victim that's been ripped off. So this is a self-perpetuating thing that happens in childhood and it perpetuates right into adulthood. And the Buddha is making a statement here: wake up and look at what you're doing, that you're in fact creating your own misery with your own unwholesome thoughts. And that's basically the entire teaching of the Buddha, but we put it in reference to the Four Noble Truths. But most of the teachers who teach the Four Noble Truths don't really understand the point because they never get around to it. In all of the lessons and all that I've ever heard from all of the different teachers around the Four Noble Truths, they tend to neglect the third noble truth almost as if in passing, almost as if, well, we don't cover that now because that's so far into the future for you anyway.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah. No, all of it is very, very insightful, very profound. And that's where getting back to the Pali, if you have a suggestion, at least for the fundamental texts that, let's say, an intermediate student should start with? For example, now I didn't want to get off on the comparative religion angle, but if perhaps something has been mistranslated because of the theologians that were doing the original English translations, I've run into a lot of bad English translations.

**Speaker A:** You're really, really putting them high up on— I wouldn't call them theologians. I would call them scholars. Riles Davies and I.B. Horner, and there are several of them.

**Speaker B:** Scholars.

**Speaker A:** Sure, with the way that they did their translations, we need to put that as a big stamp on them.

**Speaker B:** It's a personal pet peeve of mine. I'm going to have to work on it for the rest of my life, but I don't like bad translations.

**Speaker A:** Do it joyfully and then it's not work. And then there it is. For me, it's just— there it is.

**Speaker B:** It's found treasure. Than by— it's like taking a golden object out of the ground and polishing it off. So for me personally, I would very much look forward to seeing— well, first learning what are the foundational texts in your opinion, and then maybe looking at, for example, a German translation of that text and then comparing it to the English translation.

**Speaker A:** To see if— Okay, this is what I would recommend in that regard, and that is that without going too much into detail, we could understand that, uh, an understanding of the Dhamma is what we're really looking for anyway. Yeah. And that we may in fact be having to find the Dhamma in a whole lot of weeds if we go directly to the suttas. Yeah, in fact, we may need to learn how to read the suttas so that we know where to go find those Easter eggs, what kind of bushes they hide under, and that kind of thing. Yeah, for this reason, I would recommend students, you get familiar with the works of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. Okay, Bhikkhuni is dare to teach the Dharma to the Thai people, but what he has to say actually is of great value to the Westerner because it's about the human being anyway. The problem is that the stuff that's been translated from the Thai into English in some cases has the same similarity of translation errors that we have with the Pali, only they're not nearly so profound because the students who were doing the translations of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa are students of Bhikkhuni.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And so there's very, very small little things, and I'll give you an example of that, is one of the books that was, I think it was published in 1988, and the name of the book is Anapanasati Mindfulness for the Serious Beginner.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I would change that word serious out of it because of the kind of connotations that it has and put the word enthusiastic in there instead. But those are the kind of little translation errors that sometimes make a big difference in our understanding.

**Speaker B:** Right, the serious Buddhist is not what you want.

**Speaker A:** Right, serious Buddhists we don't need. But what Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was talking about, Santi Karuna understood, but he chose the wrong word, but Bhikkhuni's English wasn't sophisticated enough to know that kind of distinction.

**Speaker B:** Right, right. No, it's an ongoing thing, and it's so beneficial that he's a living teacher, or was a living teacher too during your time? Is he still alive?

**Speaker A:** He died in 1993, but first-line students of his are both in the East and the West. Christopher Titmuss in Santa Clara and Robert Bucknell are some of the Westerners who teach with the knowledge of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa.

**Speaker B:** You see, teachers really never die in that sense, but the closer people were to their living memory, the better for understanding.

**Speaker A:** Well, one of the things that's very curious and interesting and actually quite humorous, and I found this out in 2002 when I had gone back to Wat Suwan Mokkhizamokkh to visit with Achan Po, and Achan Po literally stopped whatever he was not doing and took me on a whirlwind journey all over South Thailand, all the way up to Ranong, to Chumphon, to several places I don't know the name of, all the way down to Nakhon Sri Thammarat and all the way over to Phuket. And in all cases, especially in Ranong, was a monk's conference there, but he was going back to reintroduce me to some of the monks that were there at Wat Soan Mok when I was there as a monk. It was kind of like an old homecoming, and he took that as an opportunity. We went to Srotapanna and saw the Upaya and other things like this. But here's the point that I want to make. He didn't take me to some back-alley monk in some far-off city. He always took me to the chief head abbot of the biggest Wat in the city.

**Speaker B:** The top, yeah, of the top dudes.

**Speaker A:** So Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's students are in top demand as the higher ranks in all of Thailand, especially in South Thailand. That is quite amazing, is that he had that kind of status.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's really amazing how the cosmic order can send these souls to us and enlighten us all.

**Speaker A:** No, don't think of it that way. There was no cosmic doing this, that, and the other thing. That is, in fact, that he began to look and he began to see. He began to wake up. He went through the same process the Buddha did, except that he had a whole lot of starting power to go for. Here's a little story that might help you to understand. In the early 1930s, he was giving talks because he was actually a student of Pali, because in Thailand they have actually 9 levels of Pali examinations. They're really into the language. There's guys who in Thailand not only speak the language, but one of the monks that I knew quite personally and was very fond of His teacher knew the entire Tripitaka by heart and demonstrated so in the 1950s at the Sixth World Buddhist Conference, where Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, by the way, was the keynote speaker. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so this is the level of monks that I've been kind of associated with. Just, I mean, really fortunate in that way. But the point is, is that, yes, there is that level of Pali. That's in part of the Thai culture and their translations of the Pali have been modified, and Bhikkhu Buddhadasa actually prompted some of the changes. And here's how that happened: that when he was a Pali student in Bangkok, he was invited to give talks, and in the audience, some of the people did not like what he had to say. And so they got really angry and started a fuss. And the word is Sangha decessa. And what a Sangha decessa is means a breaking, deceased. You hear the Sangha, deceased, okay, to kill it, to break it.

**Speaker B:** Yes, Sanskrit word or Indo-Germanic. It's pretty close to vitality, right?

**Speaker A:** You can just hear that word. You know what it means. It's not good, right? And so they brought him up on charges of Sangha decessa because of what he was teaching. And because it was in Bangkok and because of all the well-known monks, they actually held a Sangha Dassesa of some of the top brass, if you can think of them that way, in Bangkok. And a Sangha Dassesa always requires 20 monks. If there's a magical number in Buddhism, it's 20.

**Speaker B:** 20, OK. You have to be 20

**Speaker A:** years a monk to become a Thera. You have to be 20 years old to become a monk. You have to have 20 monks to ordain a temple. It takes 20 monks to ordain a new monk, it takes 20 of this, that, and the other thing. And the Sangha Dasesa is another place where it takes 20 monks to be— that's the monk's court. A monk's court, a Sangha Dasesa, is 20 monks come together. And that in that you found of that group division.

**Speaker B:** Right now, was Bhikkhu Buddhadasa a monk at this time or just a student?

**Speaker A:** 10 years a monk. He was an Anagami. Okay, so he was 10 years a monk, an Anicca, and out teaching and going through some of the higher-level Pali studies.

**Speaker B:** So he was ordained already by 20

**Speaker A:** monks, so a long time ago. Yeah, this is— now he was ordained, let's see, he was born in 1906, so he would have been ordained in 1926. This, so this is around 1935-36. Okay, so this is the time frame that we're talking about. He He was a monk of 10 years at that time.

**Speaker B:** So, and he revisited the Pali text

**Speaker A:** with, let's say, a new— He presented that in court.

**Speaker B:** In court, as fresh as he could.

**Speaker A:** And that— what happened with that was that that required a literature search that put hundreds of monks to work.

**Speaker B:** Looking at the text together. Yeah, is he lying about this? Is this really true?

**Speaker A:** What is this? Uh-huh. All right, so this is what the outcome was. There was two outcomes to this trial. One is, is that the judgment was that he was teaching the right Dharma to the wrong people. That was the sentence. Yeah, but because if nothing happened to it, he contended that for the rest of his life, in the sense of now that the cat is out of the bag, let's leave it out. And he became publicly known for actually publicly teaching the Noble Dharma. But he had backup. Let's go back to that panel because one of the members on that panel happened to have been the Samadhi Sangha of Thailand, the number one top monk. Yeah, who had been appointed by the previous top monk who— with— they've got cardinals, they've got a group called Chao Khun. There's between 300 and 500 of them. They're very much like the Cardinals. Okay, so there's a lot of acceptance of who's going to be the Samadhi Sangha Raja. And in fact, there's actually 6 of them in Thailand, but the one in Bangkok is the heavy-duty dude, right? This monk actually became Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's personal teacher. This is interesting. Now we're talking about that not only did Bhikkhu Buddhadasa get off scot-free from this trial, but that he had agreement with some really heavy-duty top monks in Thailand. What this indicates is that the Sangha had been alive and well for all along, and Bhikkhuni just happened to stumble into it just like others do. He just stumbled into it in a very public way.

**Speaker B:** Right, and he attracted through the controversy people to and challenged them to show where he was wrong.

**Speaker A:** Precisely so, which began to convince a lot of people. That's why he is so big time in Thailand. He is really, really big in Thailand. Here's some names of some of his students. This is jaw-dropping, okay? Number 1 would be Achan Pañña Nanda, who was the head of the largest temple in Thailand, Wat Chulapatthan in Nonthaburi. That's in fact, he was very close to Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, and that's the monastery where Sankhara went to ordain, and Achan Pañña�����a was his Upajaya. So this is close-knit stuff. Here's one that will blow you away. Achan Chah was a student of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. The first time and the only time that I've ever spent much time with Achan Chah was at Wat Suwan Mokkh.

**Speaker B:** Of all things, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Of all places. And not only that, but I also met Achan Samadhi. At that time, because Ajahn Chah brought Ajahn Sumedho to see Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. There's actually at least one YouTube video of all of the students who were there, all Western monks under the Ajahn Chah tradition, being taught in broken Thai-English, they call it "Thai-lish," by Bhikkhuni Buddhadasa. There's videos of that. Where Ajahn Chah is standing over to the side someplace. So this is the kind of connection. And so yeah, Bhikkhu Ajahn Sumedho, Ajahn Amaro, Ajahn Vipassana, that whole crowd are very close to Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and understand his teachings.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so it sounds like that's the where to start with.

**Speaker A:** This is the place to start. Is with the Noble Dharma of this whole point about we have to clean the mind out, gladden the mind, practicing Anapanasati so that we can get the mind really fit for work, so that then we can note the arising and passing away, but in doing so, we're only noting the wholesome, valuable, true things. But if you're noting before the hindrances are gone, then all you're going to note is the rising and falling away of hindrances and garbage and wind up in some dark night of the soul, or, you know, the whole story with that.

**Speaker B:** That's how Western psychology works, is just rehashing all of the bad things that are in your mind instead of just recognizing and getting rid of them and then focusing on the good and just calming the mind.

**Speaker A:** And so in Anapanasati, you can see one of the ways of looking at it is that the first, second, and third triad—the body, the feelings, and the mind—are the skills to be developed so that we can get the mind really fit for work, so that then we could go for the fourth tetrad, which is where the Satipatthana Sutta and the one-by-one as they occur, and many other places where they're talking about what to do while you're in Jhana, that in fact that would be one of the ways of saying the entire teachings of the Buddha in one sentence would be that you have to get your mind in a really pleasant state so that you can see really what's going on. Now we can say that phrase in other more technical ways, and that is that you have to get into the first Jhana so that you can see what's going on.

**Speaker B:** You can dispense with the bad and focus on the good.

**Speaker A:** Now what's really going on is that in the time of the Buddha, Jhana practice was widespread. The problem with the jhanas is that people even nowadays think that the jhanas are the ends unto themselves, rather than getting the mind fit for work.

**Speaker B:** Right, to process what's going on in a circular fashion and constantly making the right decision. Based on Dharma.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. And so this is where we then get back to the Four Noble Truths and especially the Eightfold Noble Path about Sati, to remember, to wake up and take a look.

**Speaker B:** Right. And to gladden the mind that you made it. Congratulations.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's the right effort. You have to take the effort to gladden the mind Because most meditators, they don't do that. They're not taking the right effort that it takes. They call it choiceless awareness or noting.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, terrible use of language there. Yeah, terrible use of language. They're just so deceptive and just empty in a lot of ways. But yeah, congratulating yourself to get to the point of being able to decide what am I thinking about right now and how to classify it and immediately get rid of the bad ideas, bad thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Now that thought that you have right there is another way of stating the entire teachings of the Buddha, and in fact it is stated in many, many ways like that in the suttas. Okay, and so one of the things that I would recommend that you read would be Void Mind by Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, available. You can probably just do Void Mind and bring it up on Google immediately. The PFD for it. All right, to where the void mind— the Westerner will automatically think that means void means completely empty, you got nothing. To where the void mind in this regard is actually talking about, no, we have to have wholesome thoughts in the mind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there could be a few of them, but find them and focus on them and space them out. You don't have to have gluttonous amount of good thoughts. One is enough, right?

**Speaker A:** One at a time. Exactly. That's exactly right. So this is the way that we would practice. And you can see from this, this is only a very small tinker. That whole tinker point is that we have to remove the unwholesome. It's almost like saying that the only thing that the clock needed was cleaning. If we just clean the clock, then it would work right.

**Speaker B:** Right. The maintenance manual, the second line or third line is make sure you remove the dust from the working gears.

**Speaker A:** Otherwise, that's exactly what we need to do. And so the dust would be dust from the past. So having thoughts about the past, thoughts about the future, thoughts about someplace else is dust in the clock of the ticking of right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you're manifesting something in the present which is a tumorous or poisonous type of reality.

**Speaker A:** Precisely. Okay, so let's talk about then the correct function of the clock is very much like the Atana which means the sensory world. In the sensory world, there's 5: the touch, the taste, the smell, the sight, and the sound. Okay. However, in Buddhism, we talk about 6th sense, which is the mind. Now, the 5 senses work on the outside world, but they— in the sense of reality, to where the mind is working on old dialogue, running old tapes, not in the present moment. So the thoughts that we have are often thoughts of the past. And when we're doing that, we're not in the present moment. So being in the present moment is going to be very much like being in the sensory awareness.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Thoughts of the past, thoughts of the future, fears, but also instinctive things that come up. For example, the survival instinct. Fear is being then triggered for some reason when there's no alligators in the room.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you've seen that talk or two. All right, so yes, that's exactly correct. We trigger these feelings of fear and we probably do it with thoughts that may have only been one thought moment or two, just an image.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, a split second.

**Speaker A:** Uh, it could be the thought of someone's name that you need to send an email to or something like that, and that can bring up fear in just one thought moment. But the good point is, is that we don't have to continue with those thought moments. We can change them, and we can have thought moments of when we recognize the fear there, we can tell ourselves, really, there's nothing to be afraid of right now.

**Speaker B:** And that's the Sati that recognizes it for the Dukkha that it is. And then so it cuts off the bad thought and then all of a sudden, gladdening the mind, it brings in the good.

**Speaker A:** Precisely. So now we can go to the point of the back to the Four Noble Truths and say, really, this is all about the Third Noble Truth. The whole story of the Four Noble Truths is to get ourselves into that state of the Third Noble Truth. It's not way off out of the future. It's right now, right here, right now, right now. The Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha is Western mentality, is delayed gratification. Dukkha, we got to do some investigation. We got to do some noting. Dukkha, Dukkha, more Dukkha. I have insight into Dukkha. I can really see that Dukkha now.

**Speaker B:** All Dukkha all the time.

**Speaker A:** All the time. Right, and someday, someday, my prince will come and he's going to bring a Nodukkha machine with him. OK, and so this is the way that we recognize then that this is the problem of humanity in the time of the Buddha. Before the time of the Buddha, everybody was practicing any and all kinds of meditation practices. Hoping to get something out of it. And the whole point that the Buddha then discovered was, hey, we don't have to get anything out of it. We're already okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, you're in the gold mine. You don't have to carry it to a bank and spend it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right, exactly. So that becomes the attitude. The third noble truth is the attitude of well-being. The attitude of wholeness, the attitude of got this.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, residing in the palace of the spirit.

**Speaker A:** Precisely. And that you can see that throughout all of history and throughout all of humanity, people have been lusting and thirsting and doing all kinds of things to get these kinds of feelings. Outside, exterior. They go to football games so that when the touchdown is made, they can feel like a champion because they identify with that football. Or they go to an Anagami, an Anapanasati, or someone, so that they can get wowed. People like to have magic shows so that they can be wowed and surprised and all of this kind of stuff. This is actually what horror movies are all about.

**Speaker B:** Right, to feel something.

**Speaker A:** To feel something, precisely. And the whole part of the society then, going back to the grab, is that the grab owns your feelings.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. They're on TV and you have an external orientation.

**Speaker A:** Right. And so the government makes you feel bad and wants you to vote for the other team.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, or want you to change what's on TV to change the external world, to change the internal state. But it's a disassociative method.

**Speaker A:** Can't change the outside world. And so in fact, that's what we talk about. I've had many, many people who have seen interviews have complained, "How can you possibly be happy when the children in Yemen are starving or they're being bombed?" Or, "What about world hunger?" The answer is, well, the world is going to be hungry whether I'm happy or miserable, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, you're just fixating on something you can't change necessarily. And misery, the misery of the world, how can you change it? You can't. So If you want to feel helpless, hopeless, and depressed, please just stick on that.

**Speaker A:** And start to talk about in the sense of wanting, because they're not even awake enough to make that kind of choice. Rather, it's that they're so habit-driven, so habit-bound already in making that kind of choice, that they don't even wake up to the point that they know that they have a choice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they're just looking for more misery because they've been given misery and they think that's the only path there is, right?

**Speaker A:** Bhikkhu Buddhadasa is really big on that. He talks about it almost in the sense of you have your Kamma, which is what he's talking about in more of the Thai sense, is your past. Or you have the Kamma and the Kamma Vipaka, or you have the results of your past actions. And that's what is taught in church, that's what's taught in Sunday school, that's what's taught in, uh, Hindu, and that's what's taught to the children in Thailand, more or less.

**Speaker B:** Also like the untouchables in India, that they're born into misery and there's just no chance of getting out, period.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. But the Brahmins are also born into the Brahmin misery.

**Speaker B:** Aha, yeah, that would be a fascinating topic. What type of misery have the Brahmins?

**Speaker A:** The expectations.

**Speaker B:** The expectations, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the expectations of being a priest when he wants to be a mechanic. You can't be a mechanic, you're a Brahmin.

**Speaker B:** Aha, aha, yeah, the torture of high expectations.

**Speaker A:** Yes, so there's a lot of family conflicts when you're expected to do because you were born in this.

**Speaker B:** So it creates misery.

**Speaker A:** It has its own values and it has its own misery.

**Speaker B:** So the misery of karma, you could say.

**Speaker A:** And we can also say that that would be one's destiny. That we live out our destiny. He who lives by the sword dies by the sword. That we get into a frame of reference and what comes around goes around and we keep dealing with it in that same cycle.

**Speaker B:** Another external factor that we have no control over.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. That's the attitude until we wake up and recognize, yes, we do have control over this. Yeah, we're not caught in it. And so this is the point of making the change. This is why we could go so far as to say within the teachings of the Buddha that— and you see, in Western thought and in philosophies and other places, they have the distinctions between destiny and free will. Buddhism is in the middle. And the way that you can easily express it is, is that, well, yes, but it's expensive You got to put in the right effort.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you have to have the right attitude.

**Speaker A:** Right. You got to latch hold of that right attitude and right effort and right Sati to remember to do this and take the right view. And when you actually put in the right effort of having wholesome thoughts, you're actually changing your destiny right now.

**Speaker B:** Personal responsibility. It's about you. It's about your thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Uh, dissect that word. Respondability means that there's wisdom. I have the wisdom to respond because I can see what's going on, as opposed to the word react, which is just action done over and over again. There's the habit. And so that's the distinction between— I mean, this is built right into our language, the distinction between reaction and respondability.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and then habit. You're just in a habit, you're in a cycle, but you can break it.

**Speaker A:** One of them is your Kamma, the react, react, that we react, which means we keep doing the same actions over and over and over again. Actions mentally, actual verbally, actions with the hands, is always a reaction. And we go around being punched and prodded and poked, and we react to that punching and prodding and poking.

**Speaker B:** And almost we're overstimulated in our modern environments now to the point where it's really out of control.

**Speaker A:** All poking and prodding all the time.

**Speaker B:** And that's the new normal. I'm hearing a ding here, a ding there. People are distracted.

**Speaker A:** This is why the Buddha recommends to get into seclusion so we could get away from all that poking and prodding from the outside. And now we can begin to see the poking and prodding we're doing on the inside.

**Speaker B:** Right, right, to raise the shields to the palace that you have inside and not just let everybody walk right in

**Speaker A:** and do what they want, trash the place, right?

**Speaker B:** Have a party in your mind and you're not invited.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. So all of these analogies are pointing towards something. We're using palaces and that kind of stories and realities, but the point is that we have a choice. That's the point. The point is, the whole point of the Eightfold Noble Path, the whole point of the Four Noble Truths is that we've got a choice— Dukkha or Dukkha-Nirodha. That's your choice.

**Speaker B:** Especially in one's own mind, right here, right now, you have the choice.

**Speaker A:** Got the choice. Drop it the old way, or you're going to do something new.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and that's the empowering simplicity of the teaching, because it's right.

**Speaker A:** That's how— but now you're beginning to see just how simple it is, as well as how powerful it is. And now you say, well, wait a minute, what about this 47 suitcases full of Buddhist baggage?

**Speaker B:** Where's my elephant? I need to call Ganesh.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, there's all magical powers and all kinds of things, but when we recognize, oh, wanting things that we don't have is Dukkha. Yeah, instead of wanting things and then getting them— in fact, look at spiritual power. A really easy example is the Catholic Church. With 1,000 years of celibate monks praying and doing all kinds of things to get favors from God, how many actual real miracles have they been able to prove? I rest my case. Case rested. No evidence. A very, very large absence of evidence. So, that means that any and everybody, and the funny thing is that people are leaving Christianity in droves, because it didn't live up to its magical promises. So, why are they being drawn and attracted to Buddhism, and then get hooked up into all of the magical promises of Buddhism?

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:DAMMARATO] Right, right. The mistake of thinking that the grass is greener on the other side. Every religion, every mental concept or construct has its own pitfalls, right?

**Speaker A:** And yet the Catholic Church has tried really hard for a long time to get some miracles going, and they can't do it. How do your— how does your average, uh, uh, let us say, guy who lives in Nashville, Tennessee, reading books on Dharma, how is he going to get those magical powers if the whole Catholic Church can't do it 2,000 years. Wow. What are his odds? But you can see, but he really wants it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well, I don't even understand why. Why would people want those magical powers? I mean, you know, but they have a little song or a little poem about them in the sense of diving into the dirt earth and swimming like it was in water, walking on water, walking through mountains. They've got a little list there. Okay, who would want to take a bath in dirt? You keep coming up dirty.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, I like to think of them as metaphors. I also am inspired by stories that

**Speaker A:** are metaphors for what? And then we can go after the metaphor and yank the metaphor out and look at what And then we could replug these metaphors only if they fit back in. But right now, the metaphors of all we've got, what they were originally pointing at, we're not sure anymore. All we've got is magical powers. Well, guess what? A whole lot of people who became interested in the Buddha were already interested in magical powers. But in fact, there's stories about it. One of them is Gosikatami or something like that. She— her baby died and she went to all of the doctors and then all the magicians, and none of them could bring her baby back to life. And so she went to the Buddha wanting him to do magic. And so he says, okay, you go get me 10 anise seed, or maybe mustard seed, or pretty close. And you have to get one Anicca from each household who has never had any death. And she went all over town and could not find even one house that had not known any death. And so finally she did what she needed to do with that corpse, and she came back to the Buddha and she became a Bhikkhuni. That was the magic of the Buddha. Right.

**Speaker B:** Well, the practice, the practice, it goes all the way up to death and beyond. So it can handle— Well, I don't

**Speaker A:** know about the beyond, and neither do you. It's the ones who say and beyond are the ones who— I mean, bed and bath is okay. You can go beyond that.

**Speaker B:** But well, that you get beyond the concept of death.

**Speaker A:** Oh, you know, there's a lot of metaphors like that, like, uh, death, where is your sting?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And victory over death. And a lot of people think that that means immortality rather than, hey man, I'm, I'm, I'm a lion here, and lions die, and I can die like a lion, right? I can handle that. Yeah, right here and get beat.

**Speaker B:** Right, bringing it to the here-now and saying, "I'm still alive, so I'm not going to be thinking about death or life after death because that's future."

**Speaker A:** Well, basically, right here-now, do I feel I can handle anything? That's the feeling, to cultivate the feeling that I can handle anything, so that when anything comes by, we have that attitude, "I can handle this too." Right.

**Speaker B:** And the method is there.

**Speaker A:** Old age, sickness, and death are coming.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And possibly worse. But there's no point in thinking about what could be wrong in the future.

**Speaker A:** It's just— well, actually, old age, sickness, and death are the best thing that can happen. Right. Think about it. You get old before you get sick. And then when you're sick, then you die. There's other ways to do it. You could die young. Yeah, that's worse than dying old, right? Your body— how about just getting sick and staying sick and sick and sick and not die, and then you get old and die, right?

**Speaker B:** It's a way of— well, just like fruit ripens on the tree and then finally grows thick or heavy enough to fall. Of its own accord.

**Speaker A:** Okay, right. So that's— we're talking about something that's natural. So when you were saying, uh, there's things that are worse than old age, sickness, and death, and I would say yes, there's one thing I know for sure that's worse, that's worse than old age, sickness, and death, and that is getting sick young and dying.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. Or, or being locked in one's own personal hell. With Dukkha just coming and not having any control.

**Speaker A:** Not have a choice.

**Speaker B:** Any method.

**Speaker A:** They don't have any choice. That's so. That would be then the whole teachings of the Buddha. The whole point about the Four Noble Truths is that we've got a choice. And so therefore we should investigate this Third Noble Truth so that we know what it's like to be free from suffering.

**Speaker B:** Right, to know what it's like.

**Speaker A:** So what is like, hey, am I free from suffering right now? Yeah, this is nice, I like this.

**Speaker B:** Mhm.

**Speaker A:** And I can be in that state,

**Speaker B:** and I can do this over and over and over and over again.

**Speaker A:** Precisely. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And that, that's the method, that's the Dharma, and that's where your personal responsibility is engaged. And you can't say, oh, I can't do this. You have to.

**Speaker A:** Well, we don't have those doubts later, that in fact I was getting kind of prepared to work that into it. So let's let that be next time's topic, as well as some pointers on actual practice.

**Speaker B:** Right. Well, I'm very much— I'm over the moon that we finally were able to connect, and I'm very, very grateful for all of your teachings.

**Speaker A:** Well, they're not mine. They don't belong to me.

**Speaker B:** Well, I'll be reading The Void Mind from Bhikkhu Buddhadasa.

**Speaker A:** There's a lot of others, Handbook to Mankind and other things like that, but this those kind of books are pretty slow going because they're loaded down with wisdom. They're dripping with it.

**Speaker B:** I have a lot of work to do, but discovery.

**Speaker A:** Yes, go play, enjoy.

**Speaker B:** I will.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. Okay, James, we'll see you soon.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, the core summary is as follows:

The central theme is that **the essence of the Buddha's teaching is a process of subtraction, not addition.** The goal is not to acquire more spiritual knowledge, practices, or states, but to remove the mental habits that cause suffering, thereby revealing an innate, peaceful well-being that is already available.

Here are the key points discussed:

1.  **The "Myth" of Complexity:** The Dhamma is not a vast, complex system to be collected (like a Western "acquisitional mindset"). It is a simple set of instructions for "putting a hole in the bottom of your bag" so that burdens (suffering, unwholesome thoughts) can fall away.

2.  **The Core Practice: Subtraction and Gladdening the Mind:** The path begins with **"taking away"** unwholesome thoughts (hindrances) and actively cultivating wholesome ones. This is **Right Effort**. The first goal is to **"gladden the mind,"** to create a state of relaxation, relief, and well-being. From this joyful, clear base, true insight becomes possible.

3.  **The Misunderstood Third Noble Truth:** Many teachings neglect the **Third Noble Truth (the cessation of suffering, *nirodha*)** by presenting it as a distant goal. The speakers emphasize that this freedom is **available here and now**. It is not a future reward but a present-moment choice to drop suffering and reside in a natural state of "cosmic awe," gratitude, and appreciation for being alive.

4.  **Critique of "Delayed Gratification" Systems:** The talk critiques how society (Government, Religion, Education, Business—the "Greb") and even some religious frameworks sell a story of **delayed gratification**. They create a sense of lack or dissociation and then offer external cures (goods, status, future salvation), keeping people on a treadmill of desire and victimhood.

5.  **Personal Responsibility and Choice:** Buddhism is positioned as the middle way between destiny and free will. While past habits (*kamma*) are powerful, we have the **"respond-ability"** in the present moment to break the cycle. The entire Eightfold Path is about making the choice for *dukkha-nirodha* (cessation of suffering) over *dukkha* (suffering) **right now**.

6.  **Practical Advice:** To avoid getting lost in complex scriptures, the recommendation is to start with the works of **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa**, who clearly teaches this "subtractive" approach. The practice involves:
    *   Using techniques like *ānāpānasati* (mindfulness of breathing) to calm and gladden the mind.
    *   Developing the mindfulness (*sati*) to recognize unwholesome thoughts as they arise.
    *   Letting them go and replacing them with wholesome ones, moving towards a sustained, joyful awareness.

7.  **Addressing World Suffering:** In response to how one can be happy in a suffering world, the answer is pragmatic: the world's suffering exists independently of your mental state. Adding your own misery to it doesn't help. The most effective contribution is to first free your own mind from suffering, creating a foundation of clarity and compassion.

**In essence:** The talk strips Buddhism down to its practical core: suffering is created by our own unwholesome thinking. By learning to stop that process and gladden the mind, we discover an immediate, joyful freedom that is our natural state. The path is about making that simple, profound choice in each moment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several core metaphors and stories to explain Buddhist principles, particularly focusing on the idea of Buddhism as a process of **subtraction** and **letting go**. Here are the key metaphors and stories identified:

### **Core Metaphors:**

1.  **The Bag with a Hole:**
    *   **Description:** The primary metaphor. The "acquisitive mindset" of the Westerner (or any seeker) is likened to a bag into which they keep throwing things (teachings, practices, possessions). True Buddhist teaching is not another item to add, but **"directions on how to put a hole in the bottom of your bag"** so that the contents (suffering, attachments, mental clutter) can leak out.
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate that Buddhism is a *via negativa*—a path of **subtraction, removal, and letting go**, not accumulation.

2.  **Cleaning the Clock:**
    *   **Description:** The mind is compared to a clock. The only maintenance it needs is to **remove the dust** (thoughts of the past and future, unwholesome mental states) from its gears. Once clean, it functions correctly in the present moment.
    *   **Purpose:** To emphasize simplicity. The core practice is removing mental "dust" to allow natural, present-moment awareness.

3.  **Taking a Day Off / Going on Strike:**
    *   **Description:** The relief of meditation is compared to **taking a day off from work in your own mind**—no jobs, worries, thoughts to manage, or enlightenment to strive for.
    *   **Purpose:** To contrast the habitual mental "labor" of problem-solving and striving with the peace of simply letting go and relaxing.

4.  **The Palace / Raising the Shields:**
    *   **Description:** The mind is a palace. People often let external stimuli and internal habits "trash the place" or "have a party in your mind and you're not invited." Practice involves **"raising the shields"** to protect this inner space.
    *   **Purpose:** To frame mindfulness as a protective, empowering act of setting boundaries for one's mental environment.

5.  **The Greb (GR-E-B):**
    *   **Description:** An acronym for **Government, Religion, Education, and Business**. These are portrayed as the "big dudes" or systems that **"profit off your misery."** They create or acknowledge problems (a "dissociative state") and then sell cures, perpetuating a cycle of seeking external gratification.
    *   **Purpose:** To critique societal structures that externalize happiness and create dependency, contrasting them with the internal, self-sufficient path of the Buddha.

6.  **The Treadmill / Train of Delayed Gratification:**
    *   **Description:** The common life script—study to get to the next grade, work for the next promotion—is a **treadmill or a train** where the promised gratification is short-lived, leading to a feeling of being ripped off. The mid-life crisis (e.g., going to a Harley dealership) is a symptom of this.
    *   **Purpose:** To explain how societal conditioning creates endless craving and how the Buddha's teaching offers a way to "get off the train."

7.  **The Gold Mine:**
    *   **Description:** The state of peace and well-being (Nirodha) is not something far away to be attained. **"You're in the gold mine. You don't have to carry it to a bank and spend it."**
    *   **Purpose:** To stress that the goal (the Third Noble Truth) is immediately accessible, not a distant future reward.

### **Stories and Anecdotes:**

1.  **The Story of Kisagotami (The Mustard Seed):**
    *   **Description:** Referenced briefly, this is a classic Buddhist story. A woman named Kisagotami, whose child died, asks the Buddha for a miracle to bring him back. The Buddha asks her to fetch a mustard seed from a household that has never known death. She cannot find one, and in doing so, realizes the universality of death and finds spiritual release.
    *   **Purpose:** To show that the Buddha's "magic" was wisdom, not supernatural power. It leads to insight and letting go, not the fulfillment of worldly desires.

2.  **The Trial of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa:**
    *   **Description:** Speaker A recounts the historical event where the Thai monk Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was put on trial (*Sangha decesa*) for his teachings. The verdict was that he was **"teaching the right Dhamma to the wrong people."** This event forced a deep examination of the texts and ultimately led to his teachings being validated by high-ranking monks.
    *   **Purpose:** To establish the credibility and revolutionary nature of Buddhadasa's "subtraction" interpretation of Buddhism and to show that this understanding has deep roots and authoritative support within the tradition.

3.  **The Catholic Church's Lack of Miracles:**
    *   **Description:** Used as a rhetorical point. The speaker notes that despite 1,000 years of prayer by celibate monks, the Catholic Church has little provable miracles. He then asks, if such a large institution can't produce magical powers, what are the odds for an average seeker?
    *   **Purpose:** To discourage the pursuit of Buddhism for "magical powers" (siddhis) and to redirect focus to its practical, psychological, and liberating core.

### **Summary of Key Themes via Metaphor:**
The talk consistently uses metaphors to contrast two approaches:
*   **The Common (Wrong) Approach:** **Addition, acquisition, external seeking, delayed gratification** (filling the bag, running on the treadmill, seeking miracles, buying solutions from GREB).
*   **The Buddhist (Right) Approach:** **Subtraction, letting go, internal peace, immediate availability** (putting a hole in the bag, cleaning the clock, taking a day off in the mind, realizing you're already in the gold mine).

The central message is that freedom from suffering (*dukkha*) is a choice available **here and now** through the simple, repeated act of letting go of unwholesome thoughts and gladdening the mind.
