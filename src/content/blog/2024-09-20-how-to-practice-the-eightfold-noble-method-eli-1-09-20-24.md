### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So when people say that they don't want to have their videos recorded, what that means is, is that they really don't want to change, that they want to stay afraid. They want to keep their fear. And so over a long period of time, I can suss somebody out just by asking that question: can we record your video? And I'm glad you said yes. Because that shows that you actually may in fact be interested in changing. And you've been asking about ordaining. You know, I can tell you this: not everybody— in fact, probably less than 50% of those who actually ordain and become Buddhist monks or nuns They don't— they didn't do that to, to, um, to change. There's a wide variety of reasons. In Thailand and in Asia, it's because mommy generally pushed them into it because she gets benefit when their son or daughter ordains. Or somebody's looking for an easy lifestyle or a way out. There's all kinds of reasons, but the important reason is, is that you want to change. And you can do a whole lot of changing without ordaining. But if you do ordain with the intention of change, then you need a good teacher around. And so we can get started with the Buddha said that he only taught one thing, both formally and now. He taught only one thing. Do you know what that one thing is that the Buddha taught?

**Speaker B:** Uh, suffering and the cessation of suffering.

**Speaker A:** Yes, Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. It's in several suttas, but my favorite is in Mahayana, Mahayana, number 22, The Simile of the Snake. So basically what I was just mentioning, in fact, about that sutta is that most people grab the Dharma by the wrong end, and it winds up like a snake you grab at the wrong end, turns around and bites you. And so actually, people who meditate cause themselves more Dukkha. Yeah, not less. They sit too long, they sit tired, they want something they don't have, and the whole practice of of the Dharma is to see the Dukkha, to see the restlessness, to see the desire, to see the being in a hurry as Dukkha, and come out of it immediately. So, if we can see the Dukkha, we can also see the cause of Dukkha, which is in fact our own greed being in a hurry, our own ill will, not like having to wait, and our ignorance about it. Sure, because that's in fact the cause of suffering. If you can see your own ignorance, can you see those thoughts of wanting something you don't have and being disgusted because you don't get it? That's the Dukkha. If you can see it, you can see the Dukkha, which means that now you can step forward right into the Third Noble Truth, Sukkha, Nirodha, freedom from suffering, freedom from, in fact, dissatisfaction, because you ain't suffering and you know it. You're just dissatisfied like all the other people you ever met. You're not laid up in some prison. You're not hung up, uh, on a cross. You haven't busted every bone in your body and set yourself on fire at the same time. I know a guy on the snowboard, he did that. He, he took a snowboard downhill and ran right into a buck— a 55-gallon barrel of gasoline. Broke up every bone in his body and set him on fire. Now he's suffering, right? But you're not suffering.

**Speaker B:** No, I'm pretty okay.

**Speaker A:** But you are dissatisfied with your life and you're afraid to die. Isn't that interesting? What a combination— dissatisfied with life and being in a hurry and being afraid to die.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm more afraid to die, like, before I do something, but I don't really know that's a useful thought.

**Speaker A:** Well, if you know anything about the Buddha, that you know that the really big thing that you got to do It's nothing, right? You probably even know the Pali word for that.

**Speaker B:** I don't.

**Speaker A:** Sunyata or sunyata. Oh sure, you did know it, huh? Okay, said you'd been reading. Yeah, everything is empty, and when you become empty, you're not going to be doing a whole lot. But you've been trained that you got to get something done.

**Speaker B:** That's how they refer to it. So many people, they say that there's a task or there's a goal that you have to do it like your hair is on fire.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right. And what is it that you have to do that, uh, while you're, uh, because your hair is on fire? Nothing. Stop working so hard at putting out that fire. Let it burn, baby, burn. You're okay. So the hair's on fire. There's only so much of it.

**Speaker B:** Well, I've got a bit right now.

**Speaker A:** Well, you might want to then have the haircut so you don't burn so much.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you know.

**Speaker A:** So we have covered the first 3 of the 4 Noble Truths, which actually is nothing but an explanation of his one statement, Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. And so the 4th item on that list, the 4th Noble Truth, is that there is an absolute workable method to get you out of your Dukkha. It's called the Eightfold Noble Path. No doubt you've heard of it, and yet many, many Western teachers don't even bother to mention it. They'd rather talk about other things like Metta and Dhamma, like give me money and that kind of stuff.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, never really heard the Eightfold Path mentioned. I don't— I mean, I know what I could probably list what the 8 are, but I don't— I don't know, just kind of a thing that people say sometimes when they talk about the Four Noble Truths.

**Speaker A:** Well, we talk about it as an Eightfold Noble Path, and that's an actually bad translation because it's not a path. Whenever you think about a path, you think about a bicycle path or a horse path or a footpath. A place to go. So that's a way of saying that it is wrongly stated. And a perhaps better word would be the right noble way. But even a way, like a highway or a driveway— well, actually, a driveway is not the same as a highway. That's in fact funny. Have you ever heard of that? There's a parkway, right? You drive on a parkway and you park on a driveway. That's our language. Did you catch that? You drive on a parkway and park on a driveway.

**Speaker B:** I have Verizon's high-tier premium internet down deep in the city, but I guess.

**Speaker A:** Oh, so you're on the cell phone, huh? Using, um, yeah, but I just had.

**Speaker B:** To disconnect from the Wi-Fi.

**Speaker A:** Um, to.

**Speaker B:** Resume, I had a, I guess I had a question about, you mentioned not doing anything, and sometimes that's really simple. Like, there's been times that When you.

**Speaker A:** Practice correctly, you'll eventually get there. When you say that it's simple, what that means is sometimes you're tired and sometimes you can't think of anything, but that's what ordinary people do. But we're talking about nothing in the sense that it's a trained practice, basically a one-two step issue, okay, that in fact you cannot get from the bottom up to ground level and stay there. You'll always go back down. What we have to do instead is go from the bottom to the top, and then from the top it's a downhill journey so that you can come to rest at the middle place. Does that make sense? Let's actually look at a sine wave. The sine wave goes down and then it comes up, and it goes up and then it comes down again. And when it's on the downhill journey, that's when it can come to rest, right? But if you go from nothing up to ground zero, you got to keep putting energy and effort into it, otherwise you'll go back down. Right. Sink again. So the two-step process then is to follow the Eightfold Noble Path in both directions. In the first way, we take out the unwholesome thoughts and put in wholesome thoughts, one wholesome thought after another, after another, after another. And when unwholesome habits come back, we can say, "Never mind, start again," and go back into the wholesome habits. And when you get one wholesome thought and one wholesome habit after another going in a long string, then you can begin to put some gaps between the wholesome thoughts. But even those who are not well trained at wholesome thoughts, when they go to a gap, the first thing that pops back up is a hindrance or an unwholesome thought. And so we have to be able to have such a new habit formed, such a new skill formed, that we can go to nothing and then come back into something that's positive rather than our old habits.

**Speaker B:** When you say that's right view, well.

**Speaker A:** We'Re going to talk about right noble view in just a moment. That in fact, right noble view is not a view, it's not a noun, it's not a worldview, it's not a way of looking at things. It's a verb to actively look, looking So one way to say it is, is that there are two different kinds of investigations. The police, I'm saying, one is the investigation as a whole pile of paper in a file cabinet. That's an investigation. It's finished, it's done with. And then there's another kind of investigation, and that's when the cop is actually out there looking at stuff. He's investigating, he's doing the verb part of it. And then it becomes a pile of paper. That's the noun part, okay? And most Westerners think the Right Noble View is a noun. It's a viewpoint, and it's not. It's an investigation. You have to investigate right here, right now, what kind of thoughts that you're having. Investigate right here, right now, what's happening with the body. Investigate right here, right now, what kind of feelings you have right here, right now. Investigate your attitude, and right here, right now, you investigate your thought system, your thoughts. Now, I have just mentioned something that you might have heard of. It's called the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, or the Satipatthana. This is the Satipatthana. You have to be aware by investigating And you can only be aware and investigating when you remember to do that. Otherwise, you'll go back to your old habits, go back to sleep. So you have to remember to practice, and that's the number one skill, is to remember to practice. Because if you don't remember to practice, then when you do practice, you don't develop any skill. But if you practice, if you remember to practice, if you are investigating, if you remember to investigate, to keep looking and keep looking, then those two skills working hand in hand will work together to increase. But there's another one that is the third skill, and that is the right noble effort to make a change right here, right now. To see this unwholesome thought, to remember to look at what's going on and see that this thought is an unwholesome thought and to change it to a wholesome thought. To look at your mind state, to look at your attitude and see right now that I'm in a mind state that gives me these unwholesome thoughts, I'm going to change that mind state from being a loser into a winner. We look at our feelings, because the thoughts and the attitude, the mind states create the feelings that we have. We feel afraid, we feel sad, we feel anxious, we feel uptight, we feel Anagami, hurry. And we do that, and when we can see that we're in a hurry, we recognize that that's because of an attitude, and it's because of the thoughts that we were having. Oh no, I've got to get in a hurry, I've got to get her done, I'm a victim, I'm not good enough, so I got to prove that I got to get her done. And then, okay, so you can see that system that we have. Then you can feel good because you got the job done, when in fact if you practice correctly you can feel good immediately, because there is no job to be done. Or better still, the job that needs to be done has already been done. That's in the sutta. Okay, the mind is pure and clear. That's the job that needs to be done, is to remove those unwholesome thoughts and put wholesome thoughts in place. That's the job that we need to do. I have to practice doing that over and over again. So whenever you look at that email and says, oh no, I've got to answer it, the answer to that is never mind, I'm okay right now. I can answer that email happily, or I could not answer it at all happily. So most people will answer the email and don't like it, or they'll not answer it in fume, right? But so whether you do that or not is irrelevant. The question is, how do you feel about it, whether you did it or not? Think about four quadrants, okay? Like a window like this, all right? On one side you do it, on the other side you don't do it. You've got a choice: are you going to do it or you're not going to do it? An example of that is you're going to eat or you're not going to eat. Are you going to breathe or not going to breathe? Are you going to ask that girl out or not ask her out? You're going to drive to the store or not drive to the store? Whatever it is, it's some action, some Kamma. And then on the other edge is: are we going to— whether we do it or not— are we going to feel bad whether we want to feel good. They're unrelated. So you have four possibilities: you could do it and feel bad, or do it and feel good. Then you can not do it and feel bad, or you not do it and feel good. Your choice. I assume that you would have the choice of whether you do it or not. Your choice would be that you're going to start to feel good about what you're doing, Well, you have to change your attitude in order to change your feelings, and you have to change your thoughts in order to change your feelings. And the way to get started is by having a comfortable body posture. For instance, if you're hanging upside down by a rope from a tree, you're probably not in the best shape to practice. But if you are very skilled and you find yourself in that condition, you can probably just relax with your foot hanging by that rope. That's okay. No need to struggle. So, this is how we begin to practice. We have to practice with the body being comfortable and relaxed. No back pain. This is why they recommend to sit up. But in fact, the attitude of the body and the attitude of the mind are very interestingly related. For instance, if you're sitting up straight like this, then gravity is going to pull you straight down. But if you're bent over, hunkered over, now gravity is pulling here, causing back strain. If you're leaning back like this, you're going to also have back strain. But if you can sit up straight, well, guess what? The attitude of your mind. If you lean one way or the other, then that's the way you're going to fall. But if you have an upright mind, you can sit up straight. You can mind— your mind is up straight. So we have to practice those two things together: sitting up straight and having a mind set up straight. Another one is that breathing in long and breathing out long in the body. That's in the Anapanasati Sutta. Okay, so as you're breathing in long, you have to remember to breathe in long. You got to tell yourself to breathe in long. You have to know the difference between breathing in long and not breathing in long, and breathing out long and not breathing out long. So there's a normal kind of breathing, this done absent-mindedly, done ignorantly, and now we're going to start breathing consciously, with awareness, which means that now you've got to put the mind to work, to get the body to breathe correctly. Right? Noble effort again.

**Speaker B:** So then am I making myself breathe and watching it too, or am I just watching the breathing as it happens?

**Speaker A:** If you just watch the breathing, the mind will run right away. All right. Okay. You gotta watch it intentionally doing something with it in order to keep the mind focused on it. So if you've heard anything about the Goenka retreats, when he says just watch the breath, don't try to change it, That's why their meditation is so difficult and they never get into places, because they're not actually applying the mind to the breath. Buddha recommends that you take long, deep breaths intentionally, not too long, not too deep, but just enough to make them intentional, so that you can keep your mind focused on the breathing. And between that, you're still going to have all kinds of thoughts. While you're actually breathing in long and breathing out long. So if you're having thoughts, the best thing to think about is the breathing. But otherwise, you can have wholesome thoughts like, wow, this is a nice breath, I like this, wow, I'm really getting someplace, I can do this, rather than unwholesome thoughts like, oh, how long do I have to do this, when's the bell going to ring. Those are unwholesome. I'll get something out of this someday— that's an unwholesome thought. I'm getting something of value right now— that's a wholesome thought. So thoughts about the past, thoughts about the future, are unwholesome. But thoughts about what's happening right now, everything's okay right now, those are all wholesome thoughts. Buddha, as you probably know— and I'll give you some sutta references in case you don't— the Buddha was really big on be now. Have you ever heard him referred to by the name of Tathagata?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** You know what it means?

**Speaker B:** Thus gone.

**Speaker A:** That's the worst translation you could come up with. Thus actually means this, and it's not gone, it's come. Come to this. Come to right here, right now. The Tathagata means the one who is here now, not gone thus.

**Speaker B:** How did they screw that one up?

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** How did they screw that one up?

**Speaker A:** Well, it was screwed up by a bunch of Christians, you know, because it was the Christian scholars from Cambridge and Oxford first, I.B. Horner and Riles Davies and his wife, and they started the Polytechnic Society in London more than 100 years ago. They were not Buddhist, they knew nothing about Buddhism, they were language scholars, and they're the ones who translated it and they didn't know or have a clue about what they were translating. And now Western Buddhism, the English language version of the suttas, is just way off base, really, really wrong.

**Speaker B:** So short of reading the— or learning Pali, what translation would you recommend?

**Speaker A:** I would recommend that you read— that you learn to read through the translation first. When you begin to understand how to read, given some definitions of some words so that you can make some changes as you're reading them. So when you see the word concentration, it's better to use the word organization, because Samadhi does not mean concentrated in the sense of tightness. Concentrated means over and over and over and over and over and over again. Concentration also can mean gathering things together, like a— let us say a meditation hall is concentrated with all of the students because they come together. But in general, we use the word concentrate into definition is something like taking all the unimportant stuff out and keeping only the important stuff in. That's the worst possible translation. What we really want to do is to organize the mind, to collect the mind, collectedness. Unification of mind is the definition for Samadhi, not concentration. Because it's so easily misunderstood. I've already given you one: the Eightfold Noble Method, or the Eightfold Noble Way is a good enough translation, but the Eightfold Noble Path is a bad translation. Because if you're practicing the Eightfold Noble Method right here, right now, you get results right here, right now. You don't have to wait 25 years.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** You'Re not on the path, you're not on a journey, you're stopping the journey. So in fact, many, many ways they had it backwards, but they were Christians, and Christianity is really all upside down. And so the translations that they did of this Buddhist sutras are upside down.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, another one would be Nibbana. Nibbana is badly translated. Many people think it's a city or a destination or a journey, where in fact what it really means is to stop the journey. Here's an example. Have you ever— do you drive? If you're in Austin, of course you drive. You're out driving your car, right?

**Speaker B:** I bike, but sure, huh? I bicycle, but same difference.

**Speaker A:** You bicycle? Okay, all right, well, we'll use a bicycle. It works. When you're out riding on your bicycles, don't the tires get warm?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Doesn't the chain heat up?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, when you park that bicycle, let's say you rolled it right into the wherever and park the bike, right then and there that bike is still hot, right? The tires are still warm, okay? But over time, if you don't ride that bike and that bike is going nowhere, will the tires cool off?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's Nibbana. After you stop the work that gets you so hot and you stop the work, you'll eventually cool off. That's what Nibbana is. The job that has to be done has been done. Now sit for a while doing nothing and let yourself cool off. All right, so Dukkha is mistranslated as suffering. It's not suffering, it's just dissatisfaction. Samadhi is not concentration, it's consolidation, getting things together. Nibbana is not the destination, Nibbana is the cooling off after you stop traveling. And then there's another one, which is actually a cute one. I like this one. This is my favorite, in fact. You know that the monks carry a bowl?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** No, they don't. It's not a bowl, it's a pot. Specifically a pot. It's a pot in the Pali. It's a pot in the Thai language. But those Christians, they don't want a pot on their altar. They want something nice and fancy. They want a bowl. You know, a bowl has an open shape to help it cool off, but a pot has a narrow lid to keep things contained. Yeah, yeah. So the monks carry a pot, they don't carry a bowl.

**Speaker B:** Closed.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you look at it, it's shaped like a pot, it takes the function of a pot, and the Christian translators translated as bowl.

**Speaker B:** Wow, yeah, they really screwed it up.

**Speaker A:** And another one which actually is, uh, very confusing, they call them Buddhist monks. You know what a monk is? In a monastery, they use the word monastery. There's no monastery. There is no Buddhist monks. They're called Bhikkhus. They're Bhikkhus. Isn't even the word for wanderers. They're not cloistered in a monastery. They're out in the woods. That's what a forest monastery or a forest wat in Thailand. Now the word wat in Thai is the same as vihara in the Sri Lankan, and what that means is vihara. You've heard the word hara, that means heart, and vi like Vipassana means going into. So Vipassana, vihara, the word vihara actually means in the home. At home. It's not a monastery, it's a home.

**Speaker B:** I guess I'm realizing a little bit as we talk that I get caught up a lot in the intellectual side of a lot of this. And if not, I mean, I'm sure the mistranslations play a part in it, but also the Western culture.

**Speaker A:** That's okay, that's all you've got. You're— but what you do have is a little bit correct. At least you have the sutras. You're not reading about, uh, Goliath and David. You're not reading about crucifixions. You're not reading about Muhammad killing 800 Jews. All right, so at least you're reading the right book. He's just reading the wrong translation of the book, and you're going to have to learn how to re-translate it in your own mind. Yeah, here's another one that's mistranslated. Anatta. Have you heard that word before? Yes, you probably heard of Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta. Yes, the three characteristics, right? All right, what does anatta mean? It's mistranslated as no self. In fact, what it really means, Atta, like Mahatma Gandhi, that Atta is soul, not self. But the Christian translators, they couldn't possibly translate it as to be no soul. That'll freak all of them out. So they mistranslated, probably on purpose, to be no self. Now, what is the soul? Is something that's permanent and everlasting. But a self is like a state of mind. So sometimes we're selfish and sometimes we're not. In fact, when we're a victim, we're selfish, and when we're not a victim, when we're a winner, then we're very generous. And so basically what no-self means is not a fixed self. That you're a moving target. And so when somebody insults you, you don't have to take it. Be a moving target. Step right out of the way. Play dodgeball. Yeah, dodge insults so that you dodge them. They don't hit you. You can move out of the way. But if you get insulted, it's because you stood yourself up to be a target.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Didn't move out of the way.

**Speaker B:** I've learned that specifically very recently. Like whenever I get into a small argument with my girlfriend or anyone else, I find that I'm defending a self-position, but if I surrender or give it up, then I realize that there's nothing actually being harmed and that it's the only thing that can fix it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's painful to hold a position. Really painful, especially if you hold it for a long time. Here's something, uh, let's, let's play with this. Is this cup heavy?

**Speaker B:** I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's about half full of coffee. Is it heavy?

**Speaker B:** Uh, no.

**Speaker A:** Well, if I continue to hold it, will it get heavy?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Oh, now you're beginning to catch on. All right, so the whole point is, is that if you hold something for a very short time, it's not heavy. But if you keep holding that same position, that argument gets hot and your attitude gets heavy. Yeah, but if you set down that attitude, then the conversation is over. You. Let her win, right? Yeah, she'll be happy and you'll be happy. But if you keep holding your position— oh, I'm right— it gets heavy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So this is back to right noble effort, to put that thing down. Can you put it down while you're talking? Can you put it down while you're sitting in what you would— some people would call meditation? Not just seeing those unwholesome thoughts, those heavy thoughts that we have over and over again, but we gotta set them aside. You gotta put them down. That, in fact, even a better way of saying it, you gotta throw them out. You gotta take out the trash.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** For instance, you've got a sandwich that you don't like, you leave it half eaten, then you put it aside, but you put it right in front of you, and there it is over and over again. It begins to stink after a few days. Oh no, you want to actually take it out. In the U.S., probably take it out to the road, or maybe take it out to sea, but take it out. Not just let it hang around to get old and moldy. So it takes action. This is the right noble effort. That's the job that needs to be done. It's a job in the sense that you've got to dispose of those unwholesome thoughts.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** Over and over and over and over again, those half-eaten sandwiches will be staring you right in the face. Throw them out.

**Speaker B:** So if— well, earlier you asked me if I practice, and I definitely practice. I definitely paint a lot every day, but I don't have like— I don't like sit down really hard and practice.

**Speaker A:** I mean, I don't want you to sit down really hard and practice. I want you to sit down really easy and enjoy your time. And every time you start to make it hard for yourself again, throw that thought out and say everything is okay, everything is fine, not a worry in the world. You need to really practice that, otherwise you're going to wind up being back in a hurry again.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** All that unwholesome stuff. So this is the way to get started. We need to do this. So let us 5 or 6 times a day for about 10 minutes. You don't need to sit for an hour. In fact, you don't have the attention span. People who sit for an hour do not enjoy it. They're having a whole bunch of unwholesome thoughts later in it, waiting for the bell to ring, their knees hurt, their back hurts, all kinds of things, because they're trying too hard, or they've been given bad instructions. The right way to do it is when you're very successful, to remember to practice only about 5 or 10 minutes to get your mind in a really, really good state. And you do that several times a day, over and over and over again. Get yourself in a brilliant state of mind, the kind of mind state that, hey, I can handle anything. Hey, we're having fun here. The Buddha was known as a lion. He was not humble. You've heard that the lions roar. The Buddha was a lion. He wasn't bossy, he wasn't a bully. That in fact, bullies and prideful people are actually losers, and they're trying to hide it. They're actually in the state of a victim. And what we need to do with the Samma Sanghappa is come out of our victim's mentality into a winner's mentality. I can do this. So now we've got four. We've got Right Noble Looking, set up by Right Noble Remembering to look. Followed then by right noble effort to change, to throw that trash out, and then we begin to develop a right noble attitude of, "Hey, I can take stuff out. Hey, I can throw that out. Hey, don't nothing bother me. Anything that bothers me, I can throw it right out." You can congratulate yourself and pat yourself on the back. You've got it wired. Your life is a joy. And that's when things get really good in the middle. You've heard of the story of good in the beginning? Throw that thought out. Good in the middle— hot dog, I can do this! And then good in the end— gosh, there ain't nothing left, there's nothing.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** So this is the way to practice. You think you can practice like that?

**Speaker B:** Yes, sir.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, you try that for a week or so and then call me back.

**Speaker B:** Okay, sounds good.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and meanwhile, go scout those places out.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I will.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, we'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. Bye.

**Speaker A:** See you live. We'll see you. Good for you.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) in dialogue with a Sangha friend (Speaker B), is a practical, no-nonsense guide to the core of Buddhist practice focused on **ending dissatisfaction (dukkha) here and now.** Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: The Intent to Change**
* The talk begins by emphasizing that the true purpose of spiritual practice (including ordination) is **genuine change**, not ritual, social approval, or an escape.
* Willingness to be recorded is used as a metaphor for being open to change and facing one's fears.

### **The Buddha's One Teaching: Dukkha and Its End**
* The Buddha taught only one thing: **the understanding and cessation of *dukkha*** (often mistranslated as "suffering," but better understood as dissatisfaction, stress, or restlessness).
* Most people, even meditators, often increase their *dukkha* by practicing incorrectly (e.g., forcing meditation, wanting results).

### **Correcting Common Mistranslations & Misconceptions**
Dhammarato argues that key Pali terms have been badly translated by early Western (Christian) scholars, distorting the practice:
1.  **Dukkha:** Not "suffering," but **dissatisfaction** or stress.
2.  **The Noble Eightfold Path:** Not a "path" to a future goal, but a **present-moment method** or "way" to be applied now.
3.  **Samadhi:** Not "concentration" (implying tight focus), but **unification, collectedness, or organization** of the mind.
4.  **Nibbana (Nirvana):** Not a distant paradise, but the **"cooling off"** that happens when you stop the frantic "work" of craving and aversion.
5.  **Anatta:** Not "no-self," but **"no permanent soul."** It means you are a "moving target"—you can choose not to identify with or defend a fixed, solid self.
6.  **Tathagata:** Not "thus gone," but **"thus come"** or **"the one who is here now,"** emphasizing presence.
7.  **Monk's Bowl:** Actually a **pot** (with a lid), symbolizing containment, not an open bowl.
8.  **Monastery/Vihara:** A **dwelling or home**, not a cloistered Christian-style monastery.

### **The Practical Method: The Noble Eightfold Way Applied Now**
The heart of the talk is a practical, moment-to-moment application of the path:
*   **Start with Right View (Right Looking):** This is not a fixed belief system, but an **active verb—to investigate**. Continuously look at your present-moment experience: body, feelings, mind states, and thoughts.
*   **Supported by Right Mindfulness (Right Remembering):** The primary skill is **remembering to investigate** and practice. Without this, you fall back into old, habitual patterns.
*   **Activated by Right Effort:** The **"job to be done"** is to actively **identify unwholesome thoughts** (e.g., hurry, worry, self-criticism, wanting something else) and **replace them with wholesome ones** (e.g., "I'm okay right now," "This is good").
    *   **Analogy:** Don't just notice the half-eaten, stinking sandwich of an unwholesome thought. **Throw it out.**
*   **Cultivate a Winner's Attitude:** Shift from a **victim mentality** ("I'm not good enough," "I have to prove myself") to a **winner's mentality** ("I can do this," "I can handle anything"). The Buddha had a "lion's roar," not a humble, defeated demeanor.

### **Specific Practice Instructions**
*   **Posture:** Sit comfortably and upright. Physical ease supports mental ease.
*   **Breathing (Ānāpānasati):** **Intentionally** take long, comfortable breaths. This active engagement keeps the mind focused. Don't just passively watch; gently guide the breath.
*   **Duration & Frequency:** Practice **for short periods (5-10 minutes), several times a day.** The goal is to repeatedly create a "brilliant state of mind," not to endure long, painful sessions.
*   **The "Two-Step" Process:** You cannot sustainably lift yourself from a low state to neutral. Instead:
    1.  Use wholesome thoughts to elevate your mind to a **positive, joyful state** ("good in the beginning").
    2.  From that established positivity, you can then **allow gaps and settle into peaceful nothingness** ("good in the middle" and "good in the end").
*   **In Daily Life:** Apply the "four quadrants" to any action: You can **do it or not do it**, and in either case, you can choose to **feel good or feel bad about it.** Your goal is to cultivate the attitude that leads to feeling good, regardless of the action.

### **Conclusion: The Goal is Freedom Now**
The entire teaching is framed as a **here-and-now technology for ending dissatisfaction.** It's not an intellectual exercise or a long journey. By correctly applying the Noble Eightfold Way—through continuous investigation, remembering, and actively replacing unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones—you can "cool off" (nibbana) and find joy and freedom in the present moment.

The talk ends with an assignment: practice this way for a week and report back.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors** and references a few key **stories/analogies** from Buddhist texts to illustrate their points.

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Snake Metaphor (from the sutta):** Grabbing the Dharma (teachings) by the wrong end is like grabbing a snake by the wrong end—it will turn and bite you. This illustrates how misunderstanding or misapplying meditation/Dharma practice can cause more suffering, not less.
2.  **Hair on Fire:** The common Buddhist simile of practicing as if your "hair is on fire" is reframed. The speaker suggests the solution is to stop frantically trying to put the fire out ("Let it burn") because the frantic effort itself is the problem.
3.  **Sine Wave:** The process of practice is compared to a sine wave. Going from a low point "up to ground zero" requires constant effort. The real goal is to go from the bottom "to the top" (developing wholesome habits), so the return to the middle is a "downhill journey" where you can come to rest.
4.  **Police Investigation:** "Right View" is not a static noun (a file of completed evidence) but an active verb—like a detective out "investigating" in the moment.
5.  **Four Quadrants / Window:** Actions (do/don't do) and feelings (feel good/feel bad) are separate axes, creating four possibilities. The key is to choose to feel good regardless of the action taken.
6.  **Bicycle Cooling Down:** **Nibbana (Nirvana)** is not a far-off destination. It's like a bicycle cooling down after a ride. When you stop the frantic activity (the "ride" of craving/aversion), you naturally "cool off."
7.  **Heavy Cup:** Holding onto a position, opinion, or argument is like holding a cup. It's not heavy at first, but if you hold it long enough, it becomes very heavy and painful. The solution is to put it down.
8.  **Half-Eaten Sandwich / Taking Out the Trash:** Unwholesome thoughts are like a half-eaten sandwich left to rot in front of you. You must actively "take out the trash" and throw them away, not just set them aside.
9.  **Moving Target / Dodgeball:** The concept of *anatta* (not-self) means there's no fixed target. To avoid being hurt by insults, be a "moving target" and dodge them instead of standing still to be hit.
10. **Path vs. Method:** The "Eightfold Path" is critiqued as a bad metaphor because a "path" implies a journey to a future destination. "Method" or "Way" is better because it implies something to apply *right now* for immediate results.

### **Stories & Analogies**

1.  **The Simile of the Snake (Alagaddūpama Sutta, MN 22):** This is the primary sutta story referenced. The Buddha uses the simile of a man who clumsily grabs a snake and gets bitten to warn against misapprehending the Dharma. The speaker uses this to frame the entire talk.
2.  **The Snowboarder Story:** A personal anecdote about a man who crashed into a barrel of gasoline, breaking every bone and setting himself on fire. This is used to contrast extreme physical **suffering** (*dukkha*) with the more common psychological **dissatisfaction** that the speaker argues is the true meaning of *dukkha*.
3.  **Parkway/Driveway Wordplay:** A humorous linguistic observation ("You drive on a parkway and park on a driveway") to illustrate how language can be illogical and how Western translations of Pali terms can be similarly misguided.
4.  **The Lion's Roar:** A reference to the Buddha's confident, fearless teaching, described in the suttas as a "lion's roar." This is used to contrast a wholesome, powerful mindset with the mentality of a bully or victim.

### **Core Narrative Framing**
The entire dialogue is structured around a **teacher-student story**, where the teacher is testing and guiding the student. The initial question about **video recording** acts as a metaphor for resistance to change and clinging to fear. The student's "yes" becomes the starting point for a lesson on moving from dissatisfaction to freedom by correctly applying the Buddha's "one thing": the ending of *dukkha*.
