### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Hello, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** Hello.

**Speaker A:** What? Why is the, uh, I don't know if this is my screen, but is it? Why is everybody in like a stadium or something? Like, oh, you need to change the setting. Like, you need to go to the.

**Speaker C:** View thumbnail there and you need to.

**Speaker A:** Click like, you know, click on the grid. Yeah, you have to switch it back yourself. Somebody else may need to do that. Somebody was very eager, they started the call and then they started the recorder and then they changed the view and all of that kind of stuff. But, uh, we'll be okay. So welcome guys to our Sunday afternoon talk. It's a little after 4 o'clock here in Thailand. And we've got several guys here in Thailand. Kat's in Thailand and Mikey's right here on the porch. And so most of the people, though, are on the time zones in Europe someplace. And so today we'll talk about a topic that has been well discussed hundreds of thousands of times over the past 2,500 years. And that the way that I would like to get started with it is by giving a little bit of history of it. Now, I haven't actually read this, but from what I've gotten from my good friend Dhamma Vipassana, he's done quite a lot of research, and he says that the whole idea or the whole concept of reincarnation got started at about 800 BC, about 300 or so years before the time, maybe 400 years before the time of the Buddha, in a time when the Brahmins were having a bit of trouble hanging on to all of the land. Several times throughout history, the Brahmins have owned almost, if not all, of the land in what we now consider India, and that the way that they were able to gain control over the land is by doing funerals. And the cost of one's funeral was one's land, which meant that inheritance had a problem. This is in fact why there were so many serfs and sudras that happened, was because their daddies who owned land had to give it to the Brahmins in order to get a good funeral. There is still this practice in India. I've actually been to the burning hats at Varanasi, and that's still one of the main things that if especially someone travels a great distance to Varanasi in order to have his cremation done at the burning hats, that's one of the requirements. Now, there was some political stuff going on during those days. This is back like 1979, 1980 period of time. When the city was trying to actually put up a real crematorium. And the Brahmins were so against that that they said that anybody who contributed to that crematorium, even down to bricklayers, would not get a funeral done on the funeral pyres at the burning hatch. In other words, they were adamant. Guess what? It took them about another 50 years to get that crematorium built. Meanwhile, there was all kinds of problems in Varanasi because there was only like 14 or 15 funeral pyres that were running nonstop. But in the 8th century BC, the Brahmins who owned all the land were having some conflict with that because of the warrior class. Was going in and reconfiscating some of the land. And the Brahmins' point was this. This is the whole story, is that we are Brahmins. We were born Brahmin and you were not born Brahmin, which meant that you were not good in your past, that only the Brahmins were good in the past. And that gave rise to the whole viewpoint and the whole concept of reincarnation. Now, somehow or another, by about 300 BC, that concept actually got into the Mediterranean area, that before that time, only a king, only a god, only a pharaoh would have an afterlife. Nobody else got one. And in order for a pharaoh to have a great afterlife, he had to get the priest of the local area really involved with the embalming and putting together his funeral and the funeral place and all of that kind of stuff. But surprise, surprise, at about 300 BC, anybody who had any money in Egypt could get an Arahant for their rebirth. Very interesting how things spread like that. Now, when the Buddha came along, he could see what a ripoff rebirth and reincarnation was. And in fact, they didn't even have the concept of rebirth. But the places in the suttas where the word rebirth appears is almost an intentional bad translation of the Pali word jati. The Pali word jati actually means to become something or to create something, the way that we would use the word like the birth of the blues.

**Speaker D:** All.

**Speaker A:** Right, or the birth of a civilization, not a birth of a human being. However, The belief system that the Brahmins had created was so strong that almost all of the people who came to the Buddha to gain the teachings of the Buddha had to put down that very, very strong belief. I mean, after all, it's kind of a delicious belief to believe that you're going to get a second chance. You're going to get another go at it. You know, if you screw up this life, you can get another one or two or a dozen or more. And that the part of that has to do with the fact that built into our DNA is an instinct that is referred to by the scientists as the self-preservation instinct. There's an instinct inside of us and it has its own language. And the language of the self-preservation instinct is the language of fear. So an example of that is that you're on a precipice, a high place, and you look over the edge and you have fear. Maybe the fear comes in the form of tingling of the feet, or maybe heart palpitations or other things like that. But what you want to do is step away from the edge. Also, warriors generally don't want to go into battle because they don't want to die. Very few people, in fact, want to die. And the reason generally for people wanting to die is because life itself for them is shit, and they want to die. But the reality is, is that we all have this self-preservation instinct. Even those who commit suicide are very slow to do it. In fact, almost all— they say all the suicides are accidents, but they actually succeeded at something they merely wanted to try and fail at. That suicide is generally not an act of committing the killing of oneself; it's almost actually a cry of desperation. So, think of it for yourself: How bad off could you get before you wanted to kill yourself? What kind of disease? What kind of mafia would be after you? What kind of prison sentence and the bullies in the prison would you have to put up with, etc., like that, before you actually want to die? How about when your body gets so old, so sick, that the next breath is really difficult? That's generally what happens when people die, is that they stop breathing. That's part of the reason why they call it expire. So before I go any further, let me get Deidre. You got your hand up. Go right ahead, young lady.

**Speaker E:** Thank you. Thank you, Dhammarato. Now, I was wondering, because you say there's a different system that says that we want to survive, you know, like the survival instinct, you don't want to die. So that's something that has nothing to do with the mind or training it. It's a separate, on its own kind of thing. I'm asking because my mom, she, my grandmother got dementia and when she passed away, my mom immediately pulled up like, I don't want to be, I want to be, it says Anapanasati, to be euthanized when I get this like this. And she had all kinds of rules like, if I cannot eat myself, if I cannot talk to people, if I can't remember my life, loved ones, etc. And she passed all those borders, but she still didn't want to die.

**Speaker A:** All right, now here's something very interesting. When she says, I don't want to have dementia, I would rather be dead, I don't want to be able to not feed myself, I would rather be dead, etc., she's saying that when she can still feed herself, when she does not have dementia. But if she in fact does have dementia and can't feed herself, she'll probably be just like being her mother, hanging on for one more day, hanging on for one more time. This is the self-preservation instinct, and it creates that situation where we will cling to life when death in fact would be the better alternative for many of them. But we cling to life because of that instinct. It's built right into our DNA. So that DNA, then the Brahmins were using that against people by saying, oh, you don't want to die? Well, guess what? If you give us all your land, we're going to perform this ceremony, and then you got another chance at it. Now, one of the things that I saw when I was at the burning ghat— in fact, cops took my camera away from me because I was taking photos there, and the Brahmins didn't like that at all. I got my camera back, minus the film that I'd taken. But the funeral pyres that they build are small so that the body kind of drapes over, and they always have the legs laying off to one end. There's— why would the Brahmins waste a whole lot of wood just to burn some feet? And so what they do is that at one point in time is they'll break the legs and pull them over so that the legs will also burn. But there's also an important point in time, and that is, is that when the nostrils start boiling, because when the nostrils start boiling and fuming, That's the point in time when the Brahmins know that the brain is boiling. And so they'll make a gesture and other Brahmins that are attending other funeral pyres will come around and they'll get a great big shilade like burl with a big stick. It's much more than a baseball bat. It's really heavy at one end. And they'll take that shuleli, and all the monks around are screaming and shouting in Brahman language or whatever, the chanting. And then they'll crack that skull open with that big shuleli. And when they do, brains and steam and smoke and all kinds of things burst forth in a great big cloud. And that's the indication that the person's soul has now been released from the body. They still do this in India. It's a great big show. You probably, if you know how to Google the right thing, can find all kinds of photos, at least from a distance, of them doing this ceremony. Now, The point is, is that all the people in the time of the Buddha, and still in India, many, many millions and millions of people still believe in reincarnation. So where did rebirth come from? I'll give some of my experts a chance. Mikey, what's the difference between rebirth and reincarnation?

**Speaker D:** Rebirth doesn't necessarily have to involve a soul, whereas reincarnation, as Sankhara— Actually, okay.

**Speaker A:** You said not necessarily. We could take that part of the phrase out. There is a sutta, number 38, And the Mahatanhabhavana Sutta, I think it is in the Pali, the Sutta on the Great Analysis. And in there, a young monk comes and actually he's out there in the wilderness with other monks making the claim that consciousness is there around here and there as we travel around here and there to experience the past good and bad actions. And the monks tried to talk him out of that, and when they couldn't, they took him to the Buddha. Or actually, they told the Buddha, and the Buddha summoned this monk to come and tell that story, that it was actually consciousness. And so that word consciousness has to be thoroughly understood. And that's what we'll talk about in the next few minutes, that consciousness is dependent. And yet many religions like Islam and Christianity talk about consciousness being permanent. That in fact consciousness and the soul are almost synonymous with one another, and that the idea of the word soul is an important one, that you probably heard the teaching of the Buddha as anatta, meaning no self, right? Is that correct, Mickey? No self. You've heard that how many times? Right, very few of you have ever heard it translated as no soul, and yet in fact that's what it actually means. Anatta, an easy example is Mahatma Gandhi. That name Mahatma is Maha Atta, or great soul. Now they believed in a soul in India. Long before they believed in a soul in the Mediterranean area, Christianity picked up on the idea of a soul, but the old Jewish tradition was that it was Sheol, or the grave, that when you died you went to the grave. And yet, this idea of a soul came into the Mediterranean, probably around the same time as everybody getting a fancy burial so that they could be risen from the dead someday, which happened to coincide with Alexander the Great's foray into India. And so, it seems like what happened was, is that the concept was picked up by the Greeks and brought back to the Mediterranean, the idea of a soul. And that the idea of a soul means that the consciousness is permanent. And yet it's very easy for you to see that your consciousness is not permanent, it's temporary. For instance, you go to sleep at night, where's your consciousness? How many are conscious all night long? How many of you are conscious all day long? Oh no, consciousness floats in and out. It's not permanent. And yet, for some reason or another, the religious idea is that consciousness is so strong, so everlasting, so permanent, that it actually can survive death. Now, if we believe in such things as that, then that means then, oh, well, I'm going to have another chance at it, why should I go through the hassle and the turmoil of right noble effort to get my act cleaned up this life, when in fact I've got more lives to come? With that attitude, you can see that this is the primary reason Why so, so few people ever become noble in their mind state is because it's too much work, and they've got plenty of time. But when you understand that this is the only life that you've got, you better get your act together now, or you're going to die with your shit. Why should you spend the rest of your life suffering and then have another life full of suffering, and maybe a third or a fourth or a fifth life of suffering before you finally get the idea that maybe this life I'll clean up my act. Well, this is where Christianity comes in and says, haha, we've got a magical solution. The poor dude got up on a cross and he died, and he was perfect, so he died for your sins, which means that if you believe in Jesus Christ as your savior, you're free from sin. And they have little ceremonies at the Baptist church, especially called a baptismal, where they dunk the kids under, almost drown them, bring them back up, and for the rest of the next week the kid is still in sin. So those baptisms don't actually take someone out of sin. They still get in fistfights, they still get bloody noses, they still get taken to the principal's office and get paddling. Being a Christian kid and getting a baptism and becoming a Christian doesn't really do the job. Why is that? Is because if you're actually going to become a Christian, if you're actually going to take Jesus as your Savior, that means you've got to change. You've got to start living your life the way that Jesus instructed, rather than hoping that somehow or another he's going to do it for you. By the way, on the side note, there's a really interesting thing in this, in this, in the scriptures, which talk about Jesus riding a donkey or a mule into Jerusalem for the very first time when he was already fully an adult. How many of you have heard that story of Jesus going into Jerusalem riding on a donkey? Okay, so what did he do when he got off the donkey? He went to the temple. That's the reason he went to Jerusalem. And when he got to the temple, what did he find there? Does anybody know what he found when he got to the temple? Yes, Deidre, what did he find when he got to the temple?

**Speaker E:** They turned it into a market.

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly. The bankers had taken over. How many of you have seen a small town or even your own church having the bank take over? Well, the bankers took over. They took over the temple. He didn't like that very much. And so he committed a great big sin. He drove the bankers out of the temple, and the worst part of it was, is that he overturned their tables, which means that now they couldn't do their accounting anymore. Who's got what coin? And so he caused a great deal of controversy within the bankers' community. Naturally, they're going to take Jesus and do their worst to him to make sure that he doesn't destroy their businesses anymore. And yet Christians don't talk about that. They talk about him being free from sin, and in fact he committed a great big sin against the bankers. And so that happened, I guess, this week, and next week by Friday— maybe that was on a Monday or so— but within just a few days he was nailed up. The Christians didn't like that so much, and so they had to have an excuse. Why was he nailed up? They can't say, oh, he got nailed up because he raided the temple. They couldn't say it that way. They had to say, oh, he, uh, this was all God's plan so that the, um, uh, uh, he could save people from their sin. Yes, Dietrich. Or is it Jonas? Jonas, you got your hand up. Go right ahead, sir.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I wanted to ask a question about Jesus. There's this one passage somewhere in the New Testament where he says, like, drink my blood and eat my flesh too, and you will— I will reside in you and you will reside in me, something like this. And this sounds a lot to me like the the— this idea of like becoming one with the Brahman, how much is that reflected in Buddhism?

**Speaker A:** Um, actually, those are what you would call rituals. Ritualistic eating of the flesh of the, um, uh, of Jesus means that you take on his qualities. Drinking of the blood of the Lamb means that you're taking on his qualities. You, uh, drink the wine and chew the wafer. And by doing so, you're taking on the qualities. Guess what? Having the small lunch at church while the priest is praying is not going to give you the right noble effort that it takes to actually make a change. You're not going to change simply because you drank the wine and chewed the wafer. And yet this is the state, this is the idea of the ceremony. By the way, the Buddha was somewhat against ceremonies. He called it silabatta paramasa, attachment to rites, rules, rituals, laws, and things like this, hoping that if you take a certain kind of ceremony or if you behave in a certain way, then that will be your salvation. So this whole idea then is, is that consciousness is temporary and it's not something that's permanent but affected by eating a wafer and drinking some wine. That kind of transubstantiation doesn't happen. At least I don't see anybody here who's seen any direct evidence of that ever happening, though the church talks about it a lot. In fact, no matter how many times the priest drinks the wine and chews the wafer, he still wants those altar boys. And so he didn't change very much. But if we can understand that consciousness is temporary, that means then that we can affect it somehow or another. But let's look at it from this direction. Back— what is the difference now between rebirth and reincarnation? Mikey had it almost correct when he said that, oh, reincarnation means that there is a soul that transmigrates from one body to the next, or from one heaven to hell, or some animal, something like that, depending upon the religious beliefs. But rebirth means that things happen, that you'll kick something into motion and it may have results 300 years from now or 50 years from now, but it's not you who has to put up with those results because you're dead. An example of that, in fact, one of my, uh, the interesting ones is, is that I have heard that it was because of Hitler that the nation of Israel exists. How many ever heard anything like that? Okay, so Dietrich has heard about that. Okay, now the point of it was, is, is that yes, there was a Holocaust. Yes, there was a British Empire that broke up the Ottoman Empire. Yes, there was people here and people there, and the Jews wanted back in. In fact, there was quite a lot of Jews already living in Israel at time. And so Hitler being a direct cause is not possible. It was a string of events, one event after another after another, through the 1930s, through the 1940s, up until the late 1940s when the nation of Israel was born. Guess what? It's still having birth defects. It still hasn't gotten a complete life yet. And so is still in the process of being born. But the point that I'm making is, is that it's not the way that people think in the sense of cause and effect, that a cause has an effect and that cause has another effect and that cause has another effect, and it winds up being a sequence of events. And consciousness being dependent means that it's just one step in a long progression of cause-effects, and that the real teaching of the Buddha is that we can begin to affect those cause and effects. Go ahead, Dietrich.

**Speaker E:** It still makes It sounds a little bit like that you are just a little step in a whole string of events. Pardon? That you're a little, how do you call it, chain in a large— It's.

**Speaker A:** A chain of events, exactly.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, but still is it then, still it is that you have to be heedful about your actions because.

**Speaker A:** I— you.

**Speaker E:** Still have an influence even if you're a little small chain. Yes, really careful about what your actions are and try to precisely— so what those actions are gonna cause.

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker E:** In long term, not in short term.

**Speaker A:** Well, the short term is all we have, but what we do in the short term is going to affect the next short term, which is going to affect the next short term after that. There's many, many different examples that I can give to this, and I'll give one of them now. A 14-year-old boy was standing beside his father when his father got shot in the back. 14 years old. At the age of 21, he managed to get a hold of a pistol. What did he do with it? He shot the guy in the back who shot his dad in the back. Now, what's responsible for that? Did the guy deserve getting shot in the back? What if the kid wasn't there? What if the kid had not remembered the guy? What if the kid had forgotten all about it? What if there was no gun available? You see all of those causes and effect sequences that are all there together. Okay, so here's another example that I think is quite cute too. Hitler died and went to hell, but they didn't have a hell hot enough for him, and they knew that, and so they let him be reborn as a donkey. And he was given, uh, as a, as a donkey, he was given to a little girl. The little girl then loved that donkey very much, but the donkey stomped on her foot one day and broke her foot. And the daddy didn't like that, he pulled out his pistol and shot the donkey. Now, was that donkey getting shot, was that the cause of Hitler killing all of those Jews, or was it because he stepped on the girl's foot, or was it because the dad didn't like it? What was the cause, what was the effect? The answer to that is this: very, very complicated. And so this is the reason that we can say that reincarnation is kind of like a very, very simple description of something that happens that's very complicated. And the reaction really that we should have is that it's really complicated simply because everything depends upon something else. That consciousness is dependently arising. The example would be that if you have an object but you have no eyes or have no light, then even though the object is there, you can't see it. So it takes both the eyes and the object in order to see the object. But consciousness does not end there. Once we see the object, now we want to make sense out of it. And so we tell our little selves a story about it. But the story we tell ourselves is based upon information that we had from the past. This is called Samskara. And that story that we tell then is what impacts us, not the actual object that we saw. It's the story we tell ourselves is what impacts us. And that impact then is what causes feelings. Now, this little thing that I'm telling you about is actually in the Pali called Paticcasamuppada, or in the Thai, Paticcasamuppada, where there's a sequence of events. The eye contacts the object and the mind becomes conscious of that object. But it doesn't end there with consciousness. It now has to tell a story about it. And that story is actually what we would call naming the object. And so the nama rupa and we tell ourselves a story about the object, and that story we tell is called salyattana, and that salyattana then is what impacts us, called pa����ha in the Pali, and that's what gives rise to feelings. Altogether there's 12 steps of dependent origination, and I've only started at step 3 and gone to 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. But there's a complete sequence of events that happens, and that sequence of events is determined by consciousness being temporary. And so if we can understand that things are temporary, everything is changing. Does anybody here know of something that doesn't change at all? Deidre, go ahead. Your mic is muted.

**Speaker E:** What doesn't change at all is that everything always changes.

**Speaker A:** Yes, but that's not something that changes.

**Speaker E:** Exactly. You wanted to hear something that never changes.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Okay, well, something that never changes is changing, isn't it? Wait a minute, wait a minute, you're saying that my concept of change doesn't change, and yet, yes, it does?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, what never changes is that everything always changes, everything always grows.

**Speaker A:** Well, it doesn't change at the rate that you want it to, it doesn't change in the way that you want it to. It doesn't change in the way that you expect it to change.

**Speaker E:** Fair enough.

**Speaker A:** Okay, nothing changes according to any plan or anything. It's always immediately, instantaneously, like dominoes. Okay, and so that, that whole point is, is that everything is in state of flux. Change itself is just a concept.

**Speaker E:** Maybe I have another one.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker E:** Maybe what never changes or what's always the same is the way consciousness works.

**Speaker A:** The what?

**Speaker E:** The way consciousness works.

**Speaker A:** When consciousness?

**Speaker E:** So consciousness is very malleable. It's individual, but the way it works is for everybody the same. So the way it works is always the same?

**Speaker A:** No, it doesn't. You can have two kids in a bed, or you can have two kids in a room in two different beds, and you can yell loudly and one of them will wake up and the other one doesn't.

**Speaker E:** Well, let's say then the way consciousness learns, maybe.

**Speaker A:** Well, it doesn't learn. I know a whole lot of people who haven't learned anything in years.

**Speaker E:** Well, then we maybe have a different view on what consciousness is.

**Speaker A:** Right. Okay, so consciousness then is the ability to take in information. There is eye consciousness, but eye consciousness only happens when there is something to see and eyes to see with. There is sound consciousness, but sound doesn't exist in a vacuum. It also doesn't exist— sound does not exist when Tam's got her headphones on. Because I can yell at her from across the room, she doesn't hear me. Okay, so everything is mixed together like that, but you have to have the sound, you have to have the ears, and you have to have that contact. So in fact, you could say there's two kinds of contact: the contact with the sense organ, and then later a contact with the mind. Yes, Ben, go right ahead.

**Speaker B:** I just wonder then, given that some Buddhist monks— Ajahn Kalyano comes to mind, I've heard others— but they can talk very specifically about 'If this person does this, then they'll be reborn. You've got 7 lives left to live, and if you do this, you'll be reborn as a hungry ghost, and if you do this, you'll be reborn as an animal.' Like, are they just making it up? Like, where are they getting it from?

**Speaker A:** Like, they're making it up based upon a lack of understanding of what they're reading in the sutras. More than likely, bad translations and bad teachers. Okay, so let's use the example of a hungry ghost. Now, the, uh, the picture of a hungry ghost is like a great big, um, vessel that's got a very small opening at the top, like for a lid. And that the hungry ghost means that their desire to be filled is greater than their capacity to take stuff in to get filled. And what we have with a hungry ghost is basically nothing but greed. So if you get greedy, you are right then and there reborn as a hungry ghost. Another example would be a dumb animal, basically When we think of Westerners especially, we think of a dumb animal as a worm or a mosquito or something. But the Buddha was referring to a draft animal. Now, the draft animal, the donkey or the bull, has to do its duty of carrying a burden. So the example that I have is from my time in India. I saw a donkey with a great big beam, not big in the sense of like this, but one that was, you know, 20 feet long and maybe 4 inches around. It was strapped to his back, and as he walked around in a 30-foot circle, it had a millstone that it turned. And the guy on duty then had a big bag of sugarcane, and he'd feed the sugarcane into the mill and out at the bottom would come sugarcane juice, and he'd sell that sugarcane juice for 10 rupees. Okay, how much of the sugarcane does the donkey get? How much juice does he get? Nothing. Okay, so a dumb animal— another example of that is the horse is out in his pasture, he loves that pasture, and a new farmer comes on, puts a plow on that horse and makes him plow his own pasture so that the farmer can have crops. Guess how many of those crops the horse gets? Nothing. He gets hay. Okay, how many of you feel like that when you're at work? You do what you're told to do and you get no reward. This is the dumb animal. The other one would be going to hell, and being in hell is the same thing as being hot, being agitated, being bothered, feeling bad, feeling like there's no way out of it. This is a feeling of being in hell. The fourth one is being in a state of fear. It's referred to as the Asuras, but you would think of it as in the form of the Titans. Titans were heavenly warriors, all dressed up for battle and scared to death to go into battle. Why? Because they're going to lose. And so there's these four states of doing what we want— we don't want to do— and are doing what we're told to do and not liking it. That's the animal. Wanting something that you can't have is the Hungry Ghost. Being in a state of deprivation, being in great hunger, being great desire, being angry and not able to do anything about it is a hell state. And then being afraid and not being able to do anything about it, that's the fourth one. These four woeful states are the natural outcome in— and in fact, they're listed as part of this thing that I was talking about before, Paticcasamuppada. When you tell yourself a story and you have bad feelings about it, then you want something, you become a hungry ghost. If you hear something and you don't like it and you get angry, you become a hell being, etc. Like that. These are mental states. So in fact, we can say that we don't have to believe in rebirth and reincarnation after you're dead, that you're going to get another life. Oh no, you can create that new life right here on the spot. You get reborn in a woeful state. Luke, go right ahead. Yeah, I'm just wondering, so the interpretations I've heard of like where it's translated as saying after the breaking up of the body, so you know, this person is reborn in this place. So to me, that— if I read that, I'm like, oh, well, he's literally saying in the next life, right? I can understand that.

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, here's the real point then. We have to go back to what the Buddha actually taught, because the Buddha didn't teach rebirth and reincarnation. He said In Sutra number 22, both in Sutra 22 and several other places, he says, both formerly and now, I teach only one thing: Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. And so after the body is broken up and you go into a hell state, maybe that breaking up of the body is just a broken bone. Who knows what that means? But the point is, is that the Buddha teaches us how to get out of our dissatisfaction. And that people are, after the body is broken up and goes into the next life, they're still in their kind of hell. They're still in their kind of woeful state. That rebirth and reincarnation is not a way out of Dukkha. The Buddha teaches that there is only one way out of Dukkha, and that is to follow the Eightfold Noble Path which has the real qualities of being able to remember to look at what you're doing right here, right now, to look at what you're doing and make a change. If you can see that you're having an unwholesome thought, change that unwholesome thought to a wholesome thought. You create your own hell, you create your own hungry ghost, you create your own woeful animal state. We create those out of our own mental conditioning. We're taught that by our folks, by our parents, by our teachers, by our aunts, by our uncles, and especially by the priests. They enjoy you suffering. They would rather the kids suffer, because then they can control them. But this is part of the reason why kids are taught so much garbage, is because it's a possibility of being able to control them. And look, you're still under the control that they placed you under when you were 6 years old. You still do the same things in the sense that you've got a job to do, you do the job and you don't like it. Why can't you change that mental attitude of it doesn't matter whether you do the job or not, can you enjoy what you're doing? If you're going to do that job, why can't we enjoy doing it? If we've got to go do something, why should we be afraid to do it? An example of that is walking out on stage and giving a lecture, giving a Sukkha teaching, a song, playing the tuba, whatever you're doing. But kids have stage fright, and many of them don't ever get over it. Well, why should the kid be afraid? I mean, this little kid that I'm thinking about now, he's dressed as a tree, and his only line is, "I'm a tree." But when he gets out on stage, he sees all that audience out there, and there he is standing as a tree, and he forgets his line, "I am a tree." Why? Because he's afraid, for no reason at all. And so, that fear that we have actually goes back to the self-preservation instinct. That's why the actors and especially comedians talk about dying on stage. He didn't die, he just felt like it, because he felt bad, when in fact he felt the way that he did because of the circumstances. Rather than feeling the way that he wanted to feel. And this is the real teaching of the Buddha, is to be able to see that you create your own dissatisfaction, your own discomfort, your own fears, your own anger. You create all of that stuff because you didn't give yourself a choice when you were a kid. But now, practicing the Dharma, you've got a choice. If you can remember that you've got a choice, you can stop being unhappy and start being happy. If you know that you've got a choice and you're going to sit there at your job and do your job, why don't you sit there and do your job happily and enjoy it? Why do you have to hate doing it? Then in fact, we are trained to have jobs and to not like them. How many of you here actually like the job that you've got? Don't see anything, but you have a choice about that, you see. And if you enjoy your job, that's because you've decided that you could enjoy it. But when you were in the first grade, did you enjoy that? I'm not talking about the first day of school. I'm talking about when it's droning on and on and you've got to learn that ABCs and the 1, 2, 3s, and you get homework work. No, none of the kids enjoy doing that. So we get in the habit of doing what we're told to do and not liking it. We actually create our own hell. And the kids don't have the smarts to recognize that they're doing that, but you guys do. You can begin to wake up to see that you're creating your own misery. This is what the real teaching of the Buddha is, that if you've got Dukkha, see that Dukkha and make a change to it. This is actually the important points of the Eightfold Noble Path, is to remember, to look, and to make a change. And I would go then the next step with that in the sense of remembering to look at what you're doing, to make a change, and congratulate yourself for making that change. And do that, all those 4 things, over and over and over again. And guess what? It builds confidence, it builds shraddha, it builds your strength of mind, so you know that you can handle anything. No matter what happens, you can handle it. Why? Because you've trained yourself to handle your own negative, unhappy thoughts. And throw them out. And so this is really the rebirth that we're talking about, is to be reborn into a noble state of mind. The Buddha actually talks about it in the sense of change of lineage. This is why the monks talk about it in the sense of what lineage are you in, is because you've changed your lineage. You're no longer Uncle Bob and Aunt Susie's nephew. You're no longer Mommy and Daddy's little kid. You're in the noble clan now. You have changed your lineage because you've changed your mindset from being an ordinary person into a noble-minded person, one thought at a time. One thought at a time. And yet, getting yourself killed on the motorbike and the breakup of the body, and then you're reborn— what are you reborn into? The same old crap. That's the problem with reincarnation, is it doesn't improve things. This is why they have the lie that they tell each other about making merit. 'Oh, if I build a temple and then die on that motorbike, and then after the breakup of the body, I'll be better off because I built a temple in the last life, or I fed the monks, or did something like that.' Actually, in reality, if anything, if you practice generosity and continue to practice generosity, then you will be born into the noble state of being generously minded. Rather than selfishly minded. And so, somebody could ask me a question something like this: Are you sure that rebirth and reincarnation don't exist? The answer to that is, it doesn't even matter. It's not happening right now. If it does, I'll be there waiting for it. I'm going to make sure that when I die, I die consciously so that I can make sure of what's going on. But right now that I'm alive, I don't have a clue. But I do know that if I believe in that stuff, it will slow me down in my progress. It's a burden to carry. And if you put that burden down and says, I don't care about the future, I care about right bloody now, and I'm going to get my act together right bloody now, because now is all you have. That's a very interesting thing, you know, that the Buddha taught about, uh, be in the here now. There's sutras about it. And yet what is rebirth and reincarnation is worrying about the very deep dark past and the very deep dark future, something that you can't do hardly anything. You can't do anything about what happened last year. You can't do anything about the elections that are coming up 2 weeks from now, so why should you bother about what happened 500 years ago? That's ridiculous. Better to just forget all about rebirth and reincarnation and worry about what's happening right now. This is the real teaching of the Buddhist. See that Dukkha right here, right now, and get out of its way. Also, one last point, Luke, and that is, is that what you can tell already is, is that there was a lot of idiots that were reading the suttas, and sometimes they dick with them to make the suttas conform to what they believed. And so they put little phrases in, like, after the breakup of the body Now I can keep my belief system going, so therefore I don't really have to follow the teachings of the Buddha, at least not yet. But when you recognize that now is the only time you got, you might as well practice in coming out of your suffering right now. Why keep your suffering now for 5 minutes and then come out of it 5 minutes from now when you can come out right now? And if you have the attitude that I can wait 5 minutes. Maybe after 5 minutes you can say, well, I've got 5 more. And you may find more, 5 more, 5 more into more and more and more dissatisfaction, more and more suffering, when in fact you've got a choice right now to come out of it. Better to come out right now. And so in that regard, the teaching of rebirth and reincarnation is more under the category of irrelevant, rather than just merely ridiculous. It's an irrelevant teaching. But if you think that it's relevant, it may interfere with something that's really useful in teaching, and that is to be happy right now. Don't worry, be happy. Teacher, you got your hand up.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I wanted to share something about being really grateful for the Dharma because I had a gallstone attack on the day before yesterday. I ended up in hospital getting morphine. Whoa, what a treat. But while doing it, it was very painful. But while having an attack, I was all the time I was saying, this will pass, this moment will pass, this pain will pass. And I can also be very grateful for living in this time, getting to a hospital in 10 minutes, getting morphine, that morphine exists. So I can have all different thoughts about this pain. And that was so cool. I was really— it was the Dhamma in practice.

**Speaker A:** Congratulations. I'll add one point to that, and that is, is that when you say this too shall pass, there's an underlying current in there, and that underlying current is, I can handle this right now, I can handle this, it'll pass. But if you have the idea that I can't handle this then it doesn't matter whether it'll pass on later or not. I can't handle it now. But if you have that attitude, oh, it's not that bad, I can handle this, that that's in fact the way that we want to have. That's a very, very good lifelong phrase to pick up and repeat often. No matter what happens to you, you can say, I can handle this. The Buddha even talks about it in the sense that no matter how obstructed the mind gets with hindrances, no matter how obstructed with unwholesome thoughts, I can throw those unwholesome thoughts out and come back to reality and see things the way that they really are. And that really are— pain is just a body sensation, and I can handle it. So Jamie, do you have any final remarks with this?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I mean, I think that.

**Speaker D:** I.

**Speaker C:** Mean, I'm not fully convinced by your kind of thesis.

**Speaker A:** I'm not trying to convince you of anything.

**Speaker C:** One sec, the Buddha, I think he did have all these visions of kind of rebirth and stuff. That's what the, the night under the Bodhi tree is supposed to be, is.

**Speaker A:** He saw under the Bodhi tree he figured out the Four Noble Truths. Under the Bodhi tree, but the first.

**Speaker C:** Two was him seeing beings being reborn according to their karma and whatnot, right? And I, I believe that it's quite likely he had that experience, but I guess my issue with it is that even even if he did have that experience, it couldn't prove to him that what he saw was causality, that it was the truth. He could only know that he'd had an experience of seeing sort of beings being reborn. And I guess there's no way to get from that experience to actually knowing reality as it is in itself.

**Speaker A:** Yes, there is. Let's go through those three watches of the night so that everybody is up on this, the topic. The first watch of the night was seeing how things keep getting repeated over and over and over again. Maybe the name this and the name that, and the situation is this, the situation is that, but everything keeps happening over and over again. The second watch of the night is what is called watching beings coming and going. The example that I use is you're sitting on, let us say, the roof of a building, and down below is a hardware store, and you see a guy going in, and then a minute later you see him coming out. The guy that came out is not the same guy that went in. He went in looking for a hammer and he came out with a shovel. It's not the same guy. We change over and over again. This is what we mean by the coming and goings of beings. This is that today you have this attitude, and then 10 minutes later you've got a different attitude. You're not the same person. We are taught that we're the same person. That's personality view. Personality view is that I am who I am. I was that way when I was in diapers. I was I was that way when I was in the first grade, I was that way when I was 12, and I'm this way as an adult, I was this way in college, and our memories do that by tricking us. The fact is that you are not the same person who was in diapers, you're not the same kid that was 12 years old, you're not the same kid that entered college who graduated from college. You change constantly. Everything is changing, in motion. This is what we mean by Anicca, and you're the number one example. So, uh, the delusion is, is that I am the same. That's the personality view. But if you really begin to see the Dharma, what you'll begin to see is that you're a moving target. And that you can move in certain ways to dodge the Dukkha. You can learn to play dodgeball with the Dukkha because you're not the one that they're complaining about. They can look directly at you and complain to your face, and it's not you, it's someone they made up in their mind. But if you believe that who they're complaining to is you, then you've bought into their delusion. It's not you. I am not the one they're complaining about. I'm the one who is laughing at the one that they're complaining about. So you can change. That's the whole point of it, is that we do not have that consistency But we are— our memory systems give us the delusion that we are the same, but all you have is the memory, not the sameness. You're not the same. Isn't that liberating? Think about it. You're not who you think you are. But I'm not going to destroy my government-issued ID. I didn't catch that. Mikey, can— did you catch what Lars says?

**Speaker D:** Yes, he made a joke. He's not going to destroy his government issue ID.

**Speaker A:** Oh well, let them have that delusion, but you don't have to keep that delusion. Yeah, somebody asked me, are you an American? And the answer to that is, well, there's an— there's a passport in there someplace that was issued by the U.S. government. But that's their delusion that I'm an American. Me, I'm not sure what I am. The only thing that's sure about it is I'm not an American. So that's the whole point, is yes, a piece of paper does not define who you are. Government documents, memories, doesn't define who you are. You can change at any particular point in time. So that's the second one, the coming and goings of beings. You actually come and go. But the third watch of the night is the one that's liberating. Think about it like this: in the U.S. Navy, out at sea, they have the three watches of the night. The first one starts at 8 in the evening and goes to midnight, and the second one goes from midnight to 4 AM, and the fourth one goes from 4 AM to 8 AM in the morning. By the time that the third watch is finished, so is breakfast for the entire crew, but it's daylight. So the first watch of the night, it's dark, it's nighttime, you can only see obscurely. The second watch of the night, it's even darker, hard to see, things are obscure. We can see the coming and goings of beings, but they think that it's me and you that's coming and going, and in fact it's not, it's just coming and going. And then the third watch of the night is the real liberation, and that is to recognize that you're not those things. Now you've got daylight. Now you can see what's going on if you look. So these are the third watches of the night. The first two are based upon delusion, and the third one is liberating, to wake up and see that you do have choices. So, Mark, do you have any final questions, any final statement to make? No, not at the moment. It's been great to join you. Hopefully see you all again sometime soon. I didn't hear what you said. Micah, can you help me?

**Speaker D:** He said it's been great to join us and he hopes to see us soon.

**Speaker A:** All right. How about Thomas and friends? Do you have anything to say?

**Speaker C:** What about Kate?

**Speaker E:** It's been really interesting. Thank you.

**Speaker C:** Nothing, because it's a very interesting talk. I listened to it quite a few.

**Speaker A:** Times, so I'm familiar with it. Excellent, excellent. So if nobody else has anything to say, Mikey, will you take this thing home?

**Speaker D:** Yes, I'm glad to see we have some new people joining us today. Go ahead and, you know, y'all are here on Skype. Go ahead and join us on Discord as well.

**Speaker E:** Bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, Dhammarato presents a provocative and practical critique of the traditional Buddhist concepts of rebirth and reincarnation. Here is a summary of the core teachings and discussion:

### **Core Thesis: Rebirth vs. Reincarnation**
Dhammarato argues that the Buddha did not teach literal **reincarnation** (the transmigration of a permanent soul or consciousness). He claims this idea was a Brahminical construct, originating around 800 BC as a means for priests to control land and funeral rites. The Pali word *jati*, often translated as "rebirth," more accurately means "becoming" or "the birth of" a state or condition.

### **Key Points and Teachings**

1.  **Consciousness is Temporary, Not Permanent:** True to the Buddha's teaching of *anatta* (no-self, no-soul), consciousness is dependently arisen and momentary. It fluctuates and ceases (e.g., in deep sleep), proving it is not an eternal entity that can carry over after death.

2.  **Rebirth as Mental States in the Here-and-Now:** The crucial teaching is that we are constantly "reborn" into different **mental states** based on our karma (actions). The "woeful states" (hell being, hungry ghost, animal, angry titan) are not future physical destinations but current mind states:
    *   **Hell:** Experiencing anger, agitation, and burning frustration.
    *   **Hungry Ghost:** Experiencing insatiable greed and desire.
    *   **Animal:** The state of dumb servitude, doing a hated job without reward.
    *   **Titan/Asura:** The state of paranoia and fear.

3.  **The Danger of Belief in Literal Rebirth:** Believing in future lives can become an excuse for laziness (*"Why do the hard work of purification now if I have more lives to come?"*). This undermines the urgency of the Buddha's core message: to end suffering (**dukkha**) **in this very life**.

4.  **The Practical Path Out of Suffering:** The entire discussion is framed within the practical framework of the **Eightfold Path** and **Dependent Origination** (*Paticcasamuppada*). The solution is always available:
    *   **Remember, Look, Change, Congratulate:** Be mindful of your present state of mind (*dukkha*), see it clearly, consciously change it to a wholesome state, and reinforce the positive change by acknowledging your success. This builds confidence (*saddha*) and the ability to handle anything.

5.  **Historical & Textual Context:** Dhammarato suggests that passages in the suttas mentioning rebirth "after the breakup of the body" may be later insertions or misinterpretations by monks who couldn't let go of the prevailing Brahminical belief. The Buddha's enlightenment "watches of the night" are reinterpreted:
    *   **First Watch:** Seeing the repetitive, cyclical nature of phenomena.
    *   **Second Watch:** Seeing "beings" (mental states) constantly arising and passing away—**change** (*anicca*) in action.
    *   **Third Watch:** The liberating insight of **cessation**—seeing how this cycle of suffering can be ended through the destruction of the taints (*asavas*).

### **Conclusion: A Call to Present-Moment Practice**
The talk concludes that worrying about literal past or future lives is **irrelevant** to the core Dhamma. It is a burden that slows progress. The only thing that matters is the present moment. The real "change of lineage" is shifting from an ordinary, suffering-prone mind to a noble one, **one thought at a time**. The ultimate message is: **Don't worry about metaphysical rebirth; focus on being happy and free from suffering right now.**

**In essence:** Dhammarato redirects the concept of rebirth from a cosmological timeline to a psychological toolkit for immediate mental transformation, emphasizing the Buddha's practical path to end suffering here and now.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by the speaker (Dhammarato) to explain Buddhist concepts and critique religious beliefs:

### **Metaphors**
1. **“Birth of the blues” / “Birth of a civilization”**  
   - Used to explain the Pali word *jati* as “becoming” or “creation,” not literal physical rebirth.

2. **“You create your own hell” / “You create your own hungry ghost”**  
   - Metaphorical description of mental states (e.g., anger = hell; greed = hungry ghost) as immediate rebirths in the mind, not afterlife realms.

3. **“Dumb animal” (draft animal like a donkey or bull)**  
   - Represents a state of exploitation and burden—doing work without reward, akin to a dissatisfied job or life situation.

4. **“Moving target”**  
   - Describes the non-fixed, ever-changing nature of self (*anatta*), emphasizing that we are not the same person over time.

5. **“Play dodgeball with the Dukkha”**  
   - Suggests we can learn to avoid suffering by not identifying with others’ complaints or our own negative thoughts.

6. **“Facebook for the Buddhas”**  
   - A modern metaphor for the Open Sangha Foundation website as a social network for spiritual community.

### **Stories and Historical Examples**
1. **Origin of reincarnation in Brahminical India (800 BC)**  
   - A story of Brahmins using funeral rites to acquire land, linking funeral costs to inheritance loss, and promoting reincarnation to maintain social control.

2. **Varanasi funeral pyres and skull-breaking ritual**  
   - A vivid anecdote from the speaker’s travels describing Brahmin funeral practices, used to illustrate the manipulation of belief in soul release.

3. **Jesus and the temple bankers**  
   - The biblical story of Jesus overturning money-changers’ tables is retold to critique Christian ritual and the idea of “sin removal” without personal change.

4. **Hitler and the donkey**  
   - A darkly humorous parable about Hitler being reborn as a donkey, then shot for stomping a girl’s foot—used to question simplistic karmic cause-effect narratives.

5. **The 14-year-old boy avenging his father’s murder**  
   - A story about cyclical violence, illustrating complex cause-effect chains rather than linear rebirth.

6. **The Buddha’s three watches of the night**  
   - The enlightenment story is reinterpreted:  
     - First watch: Seeing repetitive patterns.  
     - Second watch: Observing “beings” (mental states) come and go—like a man entering a hardware store and leaving changed.  
     - Third watch: Liberation through realizing non-self.

7. **Child actor with stage fright (“I am a tree”)**  
   - A simple story about fear and self-preservation instinct, showing how we create our own suffering.

8. **Gallstone attack anecdote (from a participant)**  
   - A personal story of using Dharma (“this too shall pass”) to cope with pain, emphasizing present-moment practice over afterlife beliefs.

These metaphors and stories collectively aim to:
- Demystify rebirth as a mental, not post-death, process.
- Critique institutionalized religion and ritual.
- Promote present-moment awareness and self-responsibility.
- Illustrate core Buddhist concepts like *anicca* (impermanence), *anatta* (non-self), and *paticcasamuppada* (dependent origination).
