### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, continue.

**Speaker B:** All righty.

**Speaker A:** All right guys, welcome to the UK Sangha. We were just talking about malicious gossip and how prevalent and how persistent and.

**Speaker B:** How.

**Speaker A:** Fundamental to normal social circles to partake in this activity is like from— most people can relate to this from a very, very early age. If you hang, you're hanging around in.

**Speaker B:** A group of people, you're trying to.

**Speaker A:** Be a part of it, and the main thing that people are talking about is what are they talking about? Other kids. Oh, that weird kid, isn't that so funny how weird he is? And look how stupid that guy is.

**Speaker B:** And then, hahaha, that will make me.

**Speaker A:** Feel better about myself. So yeah, this habit is developed as a kind of defense mechanism to put others down. Or the opposite happens where you become extremely self-conscious and you start putting yourself.

**Speaker B:** Down in your own mind.

**Speaker A:** So both of these come from hindrances, first of all, but lack of wholeness. So it's unwholesome. So if something is unwholesome, it's going to seek retribution or seek becoming whole through incorrect ways. So wrong, through wrong views, through wrong speech, through wrong— all of that. Yes, Metta.

**Speaker C:** Is every one of you— no, not every one of you is American origin, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Yeah. So Because you said it in a way with a very, very narrow focus on the destination and the way you explained this experience of people bonding in this particular age group through excluding people, right?

**Speaker B:** Basically, right.

**Speaker C:** This, I mean, I see, I can relate to this in a way. At the same time, from my experience as a German, it's like there is always this, and this is with all those themes, I see this. I mean, we are trying to close a duality with practicing this method. Always between something that is wisdom-based in the best sense and something that is mundane. But people also don't really think about those things. And the grown-ups around those kids, they are exactly as lost, I would say, as those kids. So in Germany, I saw those things mostly happen behind, let's say, how do you say this, like behind closed curtains. So in the front, everything is effective, everything is wonderful, the society is keeping their obligations up and so on. Everybody is acting like nothing is happening, and behind closed doors people are desperate and, I don't know, hit their kids or something or whatever.

**Speaker D:** So if they maintain the level of ordinary right view at the level of the world, yeah, free from the wrong view of breaking the laws and all of that, but even if they think.

**Speaker C:** They'Re doing the right thing, you know, they're mostly completely in the dark.

**Speaker A:** View.

**Speaker D:** And they're not doing things because they analyze them and think they're wise. They're doing them because they were told to or taught to, either implicitly or explicitly, since they were a child.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you just gather some habits based off the conditionings, the conditions of your surroundings. So no one's at fault here. It's just a set of causes and conditions. But yeah, that You're right, Vedana, it does happen at different levels. It happens at like from middle school cliques to all the way to.

**Speaker B:** I.

**Speaker A:** Don'T know, the school to different colleges to the area you live in. You can see this a lot with gangs and stuff like that being an exaggerated example.

**Speaker B:** Like I'm from here, you're not from here.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so all the way to your political affiliation, to the country you live in, to your race, to your social class— every single one of these aspects pertains to that mode of excluding others to create a stronger sense of self-worth or selfhood, which is just a product of delusion, the construct.

**Speaker B:** But.

**Speaker A:** Anyways, like how to come out of these habits is very rewarding if you do, first of all, because it just feels like plain wholesome. Like when you think in a wholesome way, you feel in a wholesome way. So if you just start, if you.

**Speaker B:** Just stop.

**Speaker A:** Thinking through things through a judgmental lens, you just feel a lot more easygoing and you feel a lot more inclusive. And like, chances are like you're gonna make— you're gonna like— you're gonna make more wholesome friendships that way as well, and maybe even teach the Dhamma by the way that you are. So like, every social interaction is an opportunity to practice the Dharma, and by practicing the Dharma, inadvertently you teach the Dharma.

**Speaker C:** It's a good side point. The way you are, not something artificial.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, not like what— not talking about like, oh, here's how you do this method, and here's the stages of insight, and here's how you get—.

**Speaker B:** Where did I hear that?

**Speaker A:** And here's how you get into first jhana, second jhana. Like, all that stuff is like technical stuff, but, uh, the meats— I mean, the, the heart of it is, um, just how you react and how you respond to things. And then trying to— and then just keeping, uh, an uplifted sense of joy even when, you know, like we've talked about this in past Sangha calls, like there's those people that you walk by that they're going to have just like a terrible look on their face, and they're going to look at you in like in a mean way. They're not going to want to say hi. They're going to be like— because they're just like wrapped up in their hindrances. So you have one of two choices. You can keep smiling, you can keep an uplifted sense of joy, and maybe even potentially spark a smile on their face. And a good reaction from them. Or you can let that— you could.

**Speaker B:** Let the input of that data create.

**Speaker A:** A hindrance in you as a reactionary mechanism. So like, oh, who's this guy with this look on his face? Like, fuck this guy.

**Speaker D:** Like, that's a really good point. And that's something that we point to be made about it is it's not that the guy, the actual face that he's making, that results in the negative response in us. It's the process of we see the negative face, right, and then we create some story about the face that he is disliking me and I am lesser. And then maybe some conditioning from when we are young of remembering when people were disapproving of us and not feeling loved. And then we feel that same feeling then and there. And it happens very quick in the mind. And so it is nothing personal. And it could never be that even if this guy is mad at you, he's mad at some representation of you he's built up in his own mind. And if you don't even know who you are, how is he going to know who you are?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so like that whole process happens.

**Speaker A:** Very quickly in the mind, and the skill that we're developing is really seeing.

**Speaker B:** How that functions, seeing how that works.

**Speaker A:** So how does this mechanism work?

**Speaker B:** How does Dukkha arise?

**Speaker A:** Like, this is effective practice, is not prevent— not necessarily never experiencing Dukkha, but understanding the mechanism more in depth the.

**Speaker B:** Next time it happens.

**Speaker A:** So you walk by someone, they have a bad look on their face, you're all happy, and then you get a bad taste in your mouth because you feel a sense of rejection as a response to some past experience where you've been rejected. When the situation is completely brand new, and it has nothing to do with that. Like, oh, maybe that guy's having a bad day. Okay, well, I'm gonna keep being happy.

**Speaker B:** Like, what is that?

**Speaker D:** Like, I was watching, uh, a Veritasium video yesterday about skill development, and, uh, it's helpful to look at practice in the lens of skill development because what we really are is just learning a skill. A lot of people talk about meditation as some woo-woo enlightenment. But those concepts are really far out there. And we can look at it as just another skill. We're learning a skill, the skill of learning to be happy, the skill of identifying Dukkha and learning Dukkha completely so we don't mistakenly Dukkha anymore. And so he outlines 4 steps in the process of learning a skill. One, repeated attempts with feedback or receiving feedback. We try the skill, right? You hit the tennis ball over the net. Does it go over or does it not? Does the player hit it back or do they not? Perseverance. Two would be a valid environment, right? Is the data we're getting, for example, a stock trader, does it actually mean anything or is it just random? If he infers, oh, I traded when the stock dropped yesterday, and then he comes up with some reason for that, is that reason that he comes up with representative of the actual reason that thing happened?

**Speaker A:** Right. Or is it superstitious?

**Speaker D:** Or if it's just superstitious, he's not actually developing a skill.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker D:** And then timely feedback, we're getting immediate feedback. The Dhamma is immediate. We practice and we see what happens here and now. Is Dukkha gone, or is Dukkha not gone? Am I still dissatisfied? And 4 would be not getting too comfortable, that we continue to practice and continue to look, and there's never a point where we just stop looking and go back to sleep, that we're developing the habit of waking up and waking up and waking up. So what you were saying, I think, is helpful to look at in the sense of repeated feedback that a lot of people will become scholars of Buddhism and learn about enlightenment and learn about all this stuff, but they never actually get the feedback of it. They never actually get in the cushion and try, does this skill work or does this skill not work? And if it doesn't, maybe I acquire some more information and play around some more. And then I try it again.

**Speaker C:** How did you phrase the second?

**Speaker D:** The second would be a valid environment. Is there some regularity in the results I'm getting that are from some, probably some other reasoning or some other pattern that I'm learning about?

**Speaker C:** And this is true for every step, right? This is true for everything and anything. If you Even if you, I mean, mostly for people, if they hit a plateau, right? If they go in their learning curve to their first real success, then, oh.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I did it.

**Speaker C:** Now I'm enlightened or something like this. And well, no real confidence anymore, no real enthusiasm anymore, motivation anymore, and so on, because it's getting— I mean, it's.

**Speaker D:** Not really getting harder.

**Speaker C:** This is just the concept too. So yeah, it's kind of a reevaluation of what you're— why you're doing what you're doing.

**Speaker D:** And continuing to reevaluate and continuing to reevaluate that again and again.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** So Dukkha is a very repetitive process. And the way that it starts, there can be varying qualities or aspects to it, but the fundamental process of going from satisfied to Dukkha is the same process every time at its core, with the same root factors.

**Speaker A:** So it may be.

**Speaker B:** And so like the problem is most people, after they're already experiencing Dukkha, they will come up with superstition or some kind of hypothesis of why they're experiencing Dukkha instead of being aware and being there for it when it happened, as it happened. So this is the skill that we're developing of developing a keen awareness of things. So it's kind of like a skilled hunter walking in the forest, and you're in the mode that you can hear a twig crunch in the leaves 20 yards away. And what's the type of mind state you have to have to like have a 360 awareness of that. Because you can see the formations of Dukkha arise if you're paying attention. And you can see how it develops.

**Speaker A:** And this is a very—.

**Speaker B:** This skill.

**Speaker A:** Is— it's not that we become.

**Speaker B:** More and more comfortable with doing this. And not we become satisfied and then we become complacent with that. We become satisfied and then we find it easier and easier to have this type of awareness and pay attention. So it's like, again, with Anicca— hey, Robert. Attainments and everything, it's more like developing abilities that you can continue to use rather than crossing a threshold and then not having to use those abilities anymore. So many people think that at a certain point of meditation they will become a certain level of enlightened, and then they won't have to use their abilities.

**Speaker A:** That got them into a wholesome state.

**Speaker B:** To begin with anymore. And then they find themselves dissatisfied because they're not practicing correctly, and then again.

**Speaker C:** Into entropy, so they decline. Their skills decline.

**Speaker D:** And this is something we can look at because this is just a skill. It's a very noble skill, but we can look at it with the perspective of other skills, other ordinary skills. That medical doctors, the doctors who come in immediately after med school, are highly knowledgeable of medicine, highly knowledgeable of how to treat patients, and but as time progresses It's been longer and longer since they've been in medical school. Their memory of what they learned in medical school is just that of what it was in medical school. And the field has continued to progress and continue to progress. And so when they're 50 or 60 and they're still a doctor, their skills are going to be a lot less than the young medical student who's just started in the field and just started being a doctor. And so we can take this as a lesson that if we were that medical doctor, that we have the intention to keep looking and keep learning and keep investigating, that although the skill becomes automatic in one sense, in the sense that the effort is less, That doesn't mean that no effort is required, like Scott's saying, and I think it's a really good point.

**Speaker A:** Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Another thing I'd like to make an analogy for is, I don't know if anyone's ever snowboarded before, but in the beginning when you first snowboard, it takes a lot of effort because you're braking. Every turn you have to brake, slow down. So your legs are tensed the whole time. And by the end of it, you're very, very sore. But the better and better you get at snowboarding, you're just going to, oh, I'm going to throw a carve here, carve there. But for the most part, I'm standing up just going. So meditation is similar. At the first, you're going to have to be, oh, there's an unwholesome thought, unwholesome thought, hindrance, hindrance, hindrance.

**Speaker A:** You're going to be putting in seemingly.

**Speaker B:** A lot of effort for these hindrances that are arising until it's like wholesome, wholesome, wholesome, there's a hindrance, throw it out, wholesome, wholesome, there's another hindrance, throw it out. And so these things, because of your correct practice, the effort becomes more streamlined, and then it becomes— it's more like you're just playing music and just going on a solo, like you become a virtuoso and now you're just having fun with it.

**Speaker A:** So that's the kind of the difference.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, Robert, you have a question?

**Speaker E:** Yeah. Do you guys have any advice for dealing with social anxiety?

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker B:** So like anxiety is like a hindrance.

**Speaker A:** So like the way that you deal.

**Speaker B:** With social anxiety is by taking the.

**Speaker A:** Social out of it and realizing that.

**Speaker B:** You just have anxiety. It doesn't matter what the cause is. The problem is restlessness and worry, which is a hindrance. And these come from an unwholesome thought, or in another way of saying it, incorrect perception. So the first step for the origination of Dukkha is a delusion about the way things are. So anxiety arises because you weren't paying attention. So first step is to, now that.

**Speaker A:** You have anxiety, change your diaper, throw it out.

**Speaker B:** I don't need to be feeling— there's nothing wrong with this moment. That was all a fabrication of my mind. That was making me feel a way that I don't want to feel. So I throw it out, I quieten the mind, and then now I pay attention. How does this anxiety arise? It arose from a stream of mental formation that were deluded about the fact of the matter. So you add some self-reflecting thoughts that were constructed out of a social situation that were giving you a hindrance. But really, there is no social sense, there is no social situation. There are phenomenal experiences arising in a way, and we need to pay attention to see how these experiences operate in our visceral experience, and how Dukkha arises. The reason why we pay attention how Dukkha arises is so we can learn how Dukkha has a cessation, or how Dukkha ends. So this is the beautiful simplicity of the teaching of the Buddha. It's not about Oh, how do I, how do I get back my ex-girlfriend? Or how do I become more charismatic in a social situation? No, social anxiety isn't the problem. Anxiety is the problem. Okay, so like, you need to simplify things into, okay, there's all these different labels I can give to Dukkha, but at the end of the day, it's just Dukkha. It's just dissatisfaction. We can call it social anxiety. We can call it a whole range of different categories and symptoms that Dukkha can cause, but the root of it is dissatisfaction. So dissatisfaction, when dissatisfied all the time becomes mental illness. And then you can call the mental illness different things based off what symptom it exhibits. But the problem, whether you're a well-adjusted millionaire with tons of friends, is you're satisfied. Or if you're in a mental in a psych ward because you had a schizophrenic breakdown, you're dissatisfied. The problem is the same as dissatisfaction. And the teachings of the Buddha has a beautiful simplicity to actually solving the problem of what's actually going on here, is that there is dissatisfaction. That's the first step, is to realize it's just being dissatisfied. So not being satisfied with the way it is right now. Wanting other things. So there is dissatisfaction, and there is a cause to dissatisfaction, which is the process of dependent origination. So how do these things arise? They don't come from nowhere. They don't— like, superstitious thinking would think it comes from some kind of— it comes from the stars, right? Oh, it's because I'm an Anagami or something like that. So it's like we come up with all these magical thinkings, and you can create a whole theory about it, about like, that's what astrology is, or karma. Oh, in 500 lifetimes ago, I was a bad boy, so now I'm experiencing something bad. No, in this moment, the way you perceive things caused Dukkha to arise in you. So it's not a magical thing of making up all these different reasons. Or even, even something that you think is more realistic is still like you think, oh, I have Dukkha because this person called me a mean name, or I was rejected from a social circle. No, that's not why you have Dukkha, because that could happen, but it's been satisfied still. It's how you're what happened. So always there is, there is Dukkha. There is an origination of Dukkha. There is an end to Dukkha that.

**Speaker A:** Comes from practicing the Dharma.

**Speaker B:** And then there is a way leading to the end of Dukkha, which is practicing the Dhamma. And then you might have experienced one of the three. I'm sorry, Robert, can you mute your thing? It's making some noise.

**Speaker E:** I'm at the function right now, just like hiding in the bathrooms to take these calls. That's why.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Just mute it until you talk. Okay. And so people will experience 1 and 3. So they'll experience Dukkha and then they'll experience moments of relief. And then they make up reasons about 2 and 4. So they'll make up a reason why they They'll make up a reason that's not true of why they're experiencing Dukkha, and they'll make up a reason, oh, this girl texted me, or I got an Instagram notification, that's why I stopped experiencing Dukkha. They make up a reason, but no, those aren't in reality actually what happened to stop experiencing Dukkha and experiencing Anicca. So the teaching of the Buddha is very scientific and methodological. So we're viewing things, and we're deconstructing it and seeing how it builds and how it functions. So it's like becoming an inner engineer. So how does an engineer learn?

**Speaker A:** And how does an engineer work?

**Speaker D:** That's the perfect example. Because engineers don't care about why. They don't care about why does this do this? Why is the derivative of whatever, whatever. They care about how, and how does this work, and does this work enough to get this machine going, does this work enough to get this program running, right?

**Speaker A:** And then another example we can use is that there is a way of learning how something is functioning by taking it apart. So this will happen in the military when an enemy country gets a hold of some piece of technology.

**Speaker B:** They can reverse engineer it by deconstructing.

**Speaker A:** It and seeing what it's made of.

**Speaker B:** And how it functions in that way.

**Speaker A:** Made in China. So the way that we practice when we already have Dukkha is in a reverse engineer direction. So we deconstruct how the Dukkha arose.

**Speaker B:** And we look at all the signs.

**Speaker A:** And the footprints and the writing on the wall in our experience of why this arose, of how you're thinking about things. What's the content of my minds? What's the— is it wholesome or unwholesome? So we can reverse engineer it that way, and then we'll gain insight into how it arose. And then the opposite, when we are satisfied, even more effective of understanding dependent origination of how Dukkha arises is being there for it when it's constructed. So that's much easier than reverse engineering. It's easier to watch someone build something and then copy that than it is to take something that's already built and deconstruct it and try to rebuild it.

**Speaker B:** But both are possible.

**Speaker A:** So this is the skills that we're developing at any given moment, whether we're experiencing Dukkha or not experiencing Dukkha. And then we might be experiencing Dukkha, not experiencing Dukkha, very quickly back and forth. And then that's probably one of the best opportunities to get a handle, understanding of these things. When you're satisfied, oh, you get a little worried about something, you get a little anxious, you'd be like, oh, there it is again. I see you, Mara. And then you go back to satisfaction. And you come in and out of it very quickly. And then it starts to become more obvious and more clear what is causing what and what condition is creating what effect. So I'm talking about this, I'm talking about this all in the theoretical sense, but this is come and see for yourself type of practice.

**Speaker D:** So yes, and like you're using the analogy of snowboarding earlier, at first when you're snowboarding, you have no idea what to do. You're falling down a mountain, you have no idea how to balance yourself, you have no idea how to place your legs in the right way. Or turn the snowboard.

**Speaker B:** And so that's a lot of— you're.

**Speaker D:** Gonna fall on your ass.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and same with you.

**Speaker D:** You're gonna fall on your ass. You've been falling on your ass your whole life, so why not start now learning how to balance, learning how to get your, uh, get your balance and right? And so oftentimes people look at— this happens with any skill. You can see the Western mindset very clearly here, that whether it's snowboarding or meditation People will want to go down the highest mountain immediately, but that's not a way to develop the skill. To develop the skill, we want to start with the fundamentals, start with what's happening right now, start with getting balance, start with not falling on your ass. And we do that right now. We see, okay, I'm going to try and be a little more balanced. I'm going to try and bend my knees instead of locking them out completely, right? And see if that works. And if that works, we develop that as a skill. I'm not a snowboarder, so this is just a little improvisation. Scott would be better at this.

**Speaker A:** I think this, I mean, this applies in so many different aspects and skills, not just snowboarding. Like anyone, when you first start piano, you're gonna like suck at it and you're gonna keep messing up over and over.

**Speaker C:** Although, can I add something?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, go for it.

**Speaker C:** If you can find something Whatever it is that aligns in the technical repetition process that gives you a better feeling, this is perfect. At the same time, if this doesn't occur, that's no reason to stop trying, right?

**Speaker A:** Right, right.

**Speaker B:** No, that's how you learn to stop, to stop practicing.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. So like doing this causes me to.

**Speaker B:** Fall on my ass. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Going forward, I'm gonna not do this, and then I'm gonna adjust. I take in the new information that that causes me to fall on my ass. I'm gonna adjust to it, and then I'm going to try this, and then, whoa, that feels good. Okay, here we go, now we're cooking. And, uh, and so forth. So we do this with our thoughts and, and, and stuff like that. We play around with the thoughts and see, um, what is going to get rolling, get it rolling, get the process started.

**Speaker D:** And we start to see patterns, we start to see, we start to develop wisdom in the sense of leaning forward completely when I'm about to snowboard down the hill, or leaning back too much, I'm going to fall on my ass. And so we develop wisdom when we feel the balance going off, when we lose our center of balance, as we practice more and more, we see that we can lose our balance if that, and we develop recognition for that. We see a pattern, and with wisdom, we decide not to do that. And it's the same with Dukkha, right? If we're in the habit of social anxiety, in certain social anxiety, certain environments, we feel scared, we're critical of ourselves, we're judgmental of ourselves, then start one moment at a time seeing that pattern. Start watching yourself. As you get off balance and watch yourself fall over and pick yourself off, pick yourself up and start on down.

**Speaker A:** The hill again and tweak it a little bit. Yes, tweak it.

**Speaker D:** Exactly, tweak it. That's a good point.

**Speaker A:** So I'll get to you, Robert, in a second. I just want to put one more example. Another example of exactly what we're talking about is coaching a sports team in any sport. So you may have the way that your team plays. This is our style and this is our strategy. And it's caused us success in the past. But then you're playing a new team. And this new team has a different strategy that takes advantage of your weaknesses. And then now you're losing this team. But then a stubborn coach will be like, no, just keep doing— this is how we do it. 'Keep doing it like that,' and they're going to lose. A smart coach will be like, 'Oh, they're taking advantage of this weakness. We're going to bolster that. We're going to adjust to their weaknesses, and we're going to attack at those points.' So they adjust to what they're in the real time. They're looking at what's going on in real time, making the adjustments to what's going on. And that's what differentiates a successful coach who knows how to adjust to whatever team they're playing or adjust to whatever is happening, rather than having a dead set way of how we do things. No, this is how I do it, and even if it doesn't work and it causes me suffering over and over again, that's just the way it is and I can't change it. That's the mentality that kind of like just repeats the same karma over and over. Okay, Robert. What's your question?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I appreciate it, guys. I'm gonna head back to the group now. I like that, um, point you gave me, Scott, about realizing that it's not the, um, it's not the, the situation that's giving me the anxiety and the situation's the problem. It's just the anxiety itself that's the problem, right? And that's gonna— I think that's gonna help me change my mindset. So it's more like I'm okay in the situation. I'm just tackling the anxiety and not like worrying about the situation so much, just worrying about how I feel, you know, my Anapanasati and getting that sorted out first and foremost.

**Speaker A:** Right, that's the only way it'll work. So have fun. Have fun.

**Speaker E:** I'll take this for the test.

**Speaker A:** Nice seeing you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, peace out, boys.

**Speaker A:** Take care, man. Have a good one. Okay, any other things you'd like to talk about? I think going on the thread of.

**Speaker D:** That, Dukkha gets subtler and subtler, like you're saying, that as we develop strategies that work and that beat other teams, there are going to be better teams, or Mara is going to be getting more skilled Or rather, the strategies that we didn't see before start to become more apparent. The unwholesome patterns that we didn't see before, we start to notice. It's subtler. And when we see that subtle Dukkha, it's about being able to see it and say, that's Dukkha, rather than, oh, I don't suffer anymore, and I'm done with Dukkha. Because like you're saying, that's the stubborn sports coach who thinks his strategy is perfect and he doesn't need to think anymore. No, this is about investigation, constant investigation. Go ahead, Scott.

**Speaker A:** Right, so I see this a lot in spiritual circles, is that no, actually consciousness is permanent, or it's one or the other. So like you'll get into all these ideologies and views about the way things.

**Speaker B:** Are and.

**Speaker A:** Cling on to it.

**Speaker B:** As.

**Speaker A:** The way to Nibbana or the way to the end of suffering. And when it doesn't produce the results that you desire, that you're satisfied with, you will still cling on. If you're practicing incorrectly, you will still cling on to it, just like We can say the same thing with beliefs and religious beliefs. Have you ever met someone who has a belief about things, and when presented with a coherent logical argument about why it's wrong, and it's all the evidence is put right in front of their face about why these are inconsistent beliefs, why they don't match up to reality, and there's no evidence for them. And here's actually a logical reason why it's wrong, and here's the evidence that can be repeated why it's wrong. But they would be like, nope, I have faith, right?

**Speaker B:** So the.

**Speaker A:** Faith we have in Buddhism is not really the same way most people think of faith as as a blind belief, right? We don't have blind belief in that sense. We have experiential confirmation that this is the way. This is the way to the end of suffering, and this works, and I can do this. That's more of a conviction based off experiential knowledge or insight than it is about believing in something that doesn't produce the results or promises future results that you're never going to encounter right now. It's just magical thinking and superstition, and this is going to go round and round in a circle, piling up more.

**Speaker C:** And more and more instead of letting things go away, fading out.

**Speaker A:** Well, the thing is, like, instead of things happen the way that they have, like, phenomenologically, things are arising and passing away. It's just how we view and interpret.

**Speaker B:** Things.

**Speaker A:** Which also arises and passes away, that is going to cause us Dukkha. Or not. So it's not that things will change.

**Speaker B:** Like how things function, the natural law.

**Speaker A:** The ingrained, the fundamental law of cause and effect and dependent origination.

**Speaker C:** Never understand the Second Noble Truth. Basically, you understand the Second Noble Truth that the clinging to it The attachment is the problem.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but that's not enough. You have to understand how does clinging.

**Speaker B:** Arise, and not just on paper like.

**Speaker A:** You'Re memorizing it for a test.

**Speaker C:** That's where the question comes from. That's where the question for the most people comes from. They try something and try something and try something, it doesn't work. They are not able to see it because they are not advanced enough in their meditation. And so they, okay, the only thing they know is what they learned. And then this conditioning kicks in and they grasp for delusions. That's the natural dependent thing they do in this situation. So this is where you have to teach directly into.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so a good teacher will tell.

**Speaker B:** This person.

**Speaker A:** It's kind of like, instead of like a lot of spiritual teachers, you know, it's the difference between giving a man a fish and teaching him how to fish. There's a difference. So it's like same thing with education. Like if you're teaching someone how to learn rather than giving them new knowledge and information to store in their mind, One is going to lead to a lot more benefit than the other. So how to teach someone is you teach them how to look, stop and look at what you're doing. This doesn't work continually over and over until you understand how it works and you get good at it. You don't teach— they don't just teach you, oh, here's the fruit. Oh, it's just like right away because I did the work and now I'm just going to give it to you. And now you're dependent on me, and I give it to you every time. That's the difference between a lot of traditions where it's like more heavily reliant on some sort of magical guru, as opposed to learning the Dhamma and applying the Dhamma for yourself in your own experience. Because the Dharma is not— the Dharma is universally for everyone. Like, the Dharma can be practiced for everyone. Whether it's going to be understood or people are going to want to practice it is a different question, but it's possible for anyone to practice the Dharma and repeat the same methods and get the same results as anyone else if they are— if they can care enough to look and care enough to practice.

**Speaker C:** Except the spark. The spark is something where you really need someone who can inspire this in you. I mean, if I would just read Dhammarato blog, for example, and stay in the things I learned before a few years, it wouldn't really ignite the 8-foot-long.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you make a really good point.

**Speaker D:** Uh, that when we're just reading things, uh, it's less likely that we get that slap in the face and actually understand things, and someone to set us straight beyond the pattern of what you were talking about, Vedana, of, uh, maybe getting a little taste or having— hearing something that you like and then holding on to that because you're too scared to admit that you don't know, And so, for example, to have someone to bring you back to remind you that the practice is immediate, the practice is here and now, the practice is independent of that old view or old thing that you like that you're holding on to.

**Speaker C:** If you're able to see it, most people just don't even see that. They don't see what they are doing. They're doing it. And they have the bad results, and then they are mean to themselves.

**Speaker D:** But there isn't that clear seeing, there isn't that Anapanasati, there isn't that— Yeah, go ahead, Scott.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, what you said about the spark is true, but it's true in the same way. For instance, how does someone learn math? From the teacher. The first thing the teacher does is do the problem, walk them through it. Step by step, and then so you're there for them doing it, and they do it for you.

**Speaker B:** So they walk you through, here's Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** And now get you into wholesome state, Dukkha, Nirodha. I did it for you. That's like doing the math problem step by step, and they're doing it for you, and you're learning that way. But then the progression is that, okay, now go do it on your own. Exactly. So now you do the examples, you fuck up the examples, you come back and you'd be like, why did I fuck up? And then you'd be like, oh, here's this, this, and this that you fucked up. And then so you start to learn in this way until you start succeeding at your own examples. And maybe there, maybe eventually you get stuck. And okay, now I'm stuck again. And Maybe let me try to figure it out first on my own. So you put some genuine effort into figuring out first on your own instead of going crying to Papa Dhammarato. And you might figure it out. Oh, actually, I am not stuck anymore. I figured it out.

**Speaker C:** Or you're really, really— somebody can do this wonderful.

**Speaker D:** That's a really good point.

**Speaker C:** Or you're different people, different learning styles. I'm sorry to interrupt. I have to go. I wish you The best, best Dharma conversation now. Till the next time, have fun.

**Speaker D:** Great seeing you, Vedana.

**Speaker E:** Bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I was just gonna say, if you're— in response to Veda there— if you really, really are stuck, then you bring it to the teacher and, hey, need some help on this. And then you can be like, oh, actually, that was pretty simple. And then You learn that way.

**Speaker D:** Um, yes, and this connects with the idea of skill development, that the feedback, right, that some people will read a book and read a book and read a book, and then they'll get to the practice problems and say, oh, I actually understand enough, I don't even need to do the practice problems, let me keep on reading. But that's that we need to do the practice problems to actually develop the skill. And we can lie to ourselves saying we understand it when we really don't. The understanding comes from the trial and error, the the experiential learning. And this is the same with practice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And then once you finish, once you get the problem right, you complete the test, you can go, whoopee, I did it, my job is done, I got an A+. And that's similar to the practice. So you do the practice, you succeed at the practice, you congratulate yourself for succeeding at the practice, and you feel even better. And now you can just sit here and be satisfied with nothing to do and nowhere to go because you're sitting on your pile of dirt victoriously. But you had to get on top of the pile. You had to dig yourself out of the dirt and you had to get on top of it. And also people are throwing buckets of dirt on you and you have to wipe off that dirt until you really are on top of the pile of dirt. And you have to clean yourself off if more dirt gets on you. But then you can enjoy sitting as a champion victoriously. And you can relish it and celebrate it and soak it in and really appreciate the the magnitude and the scale of this achievement that goes beyond anything. This is a more impressive achievement.

**Speaker B:** Than.

**Speaker A:** Any materialistic achievement you can have, because this goes past the relative problems and solves the big problem. The only problem there really is is Dukkha. Aside from that, that's just Dukkha and wearing different costumes is other problems. So you solve Dukkha, you solve the biggest problem that there is and the only real problem behind all problems. So yeah, you become— you're just, you know, filtering things down to solving the main problem of it all. And then you can enjoy yourself and celebrate um, afterwards. And, uh, you can— that's the beauty of it, is like you can like not even teach the Dhamma. You can become your own Buddha and like never talk about it again, or you could teach it because, uh, it can help people and benefit people. But, um, either way, it's, it's a good thing.

**Speaker D:** Um, either way, no problem.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, no problem. And, and, and, uh, and, uh Yeah, it doesn't get any better than that. So like, the teaching of the Buddha has a profound depth to it, although on the outside it may seem like, oh, why are there all these lists and these numbers for things? But the applicational benefits is almost beyond the comprehension of the ordinary capacity of the mind in the sense of like the discursive thought process. So a lot of spirituality will be like, oh, go beyond the mind and you have to go like, it's like unfathomable, like you're not going to understand it. But you can understand it, you can deconstruct it, you can break things down. It's just you're not using the same skills that you're used to using. So you're not using the same.

**Speaker B:** Method.

**Speaker A:** Of thinking that you were before. But it still is a way of understanding and a way of seeing and a way of of deconstructing and a way of discerning.

**Speaker D:** Like you can tell someone to balance on their snowboard, right? But that telling, that pointing at the idea of balancing on their snowboard is nothing compared to the physical bodily experience of balancing on the snowboard.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So like how in theory do you balance on a snowboard versus how it actually feels to do it?

**Speaker D:** You can read textbook after textbook on balancing on a snowboard and not actually learn experientially how to balance.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's probably the simplest way to put it and the best way.

**Speaker D:** And life is just an endless mountain of snow and we're snowing down it. And most people just fall down after time after time. They're not even looking. They're blindfolded practically. And maybe they just give up and they're lying on the ground in Dukkha, right? But we have the opportunity to enjoy the ride and get up. And when we fall down, learn, learn, investigate. What did I do to miss my balance? And get back up and enjoy the ride.

**Speaker A:** I'm gonna lie down here and feel sorry for myself and scoot on my butt all the way down, or am I gonna try again? Oh shit, I fell on my ass. But that guy looks— he's having a lot of fun over there. Let me try it again. And so you get good at riding down the mountain, and you start to enjoy this thing called life. And you can appreciate it and could realize that when I fall on my ass, I have a choice to feel sorry for myself, or I have a choice to look at what I'm doing and adjust to it and be curious.

**Speaker D:** How did I fall on my ass? Yeah, it must have been some delusion there. I want to see what that is and get back up and learn how to snowboard again.

**Speaker A:** Right, right, right. All right, so I think that's been great. Yeah, it's been a great talk, man. I think a lot of good conversation came up. Um, uh, it was good to see you. And, uh, uh, we, we, uh, we had some members arise and pass away, but I think even, even like even two people here, uh, generates a lot of Sati and a lot of good conversation. And I think a lot of people can benefit from the YouTube video and so on. And future generations, they're going to be digging up this video from the hard drives. Maybe some alien civilization or something can learn the Dharma from deciphering what we're talking about. So I'll leave it at that.

**Speaker D:** All right, this has been great. Yeah, if you're in a future generation, this probably isn't relevant to you, but those of you who are in this generation, there's a link in the description for Discord and to join these Sangha calls. All are welcome. All right, see you, Scott.

**Speaker A:** See ya.

**Speaker D:** Bye.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk transcript, here is a summary of the key themes and teachings discussed:

### **Core Topic: Unwholesome Social Habits & The Root of Dukkha**
The talk begins by examining **malicious gossip** and social exclusion as a deep-seated, unwholesome habit developed from a young age. This behavior is identified as a defense mechanism to build self-worth by putting others down, or conversely, turning that criticism inward. The root cause is a **lack of wholeness** (*akusala*), leading to actions based on wrong view and wrong speech.

### **The Universal Problem: Dukkha (Suffering/Dissatisfaction)**
The conversation shifts to the fundamental Buddhist teaching of **Dukkha**. The speakers emphasize that whether it's labeled as social anxiety, gossip, or any other mental distress, the core issue is always the same: **dissatisfaction**. The problem isn't the external situation but our internal reaction—the process of how dissatisfaction arises in the mind.

### **The Path Out: Skill Development & Investigation**
The talk frames meditation and Dhamma practice not as mystical enlightenment, but as a **practical skill to be developed**, similar to learning snowboarding, a musical instrument, or engineering. Key steps in this skill development are:
1.  **Repeated Attempts with Feedback:** Try a technique (e.g., cultivating wholesome thoughts) and see if it reduces dissatisfaction.
2.  **A Valid Environment:** Ensure your practice is based on real cause-and-effect, not superstition (e.g., "My anxiety is because of my stars").
3.  **Timely Feedback:** The Dhamma offers immediate results. You can see *right now* if a thought pattern leads to peace or distress.
4.  **Avoiding Complacency:** Never stop investigating. As one subtle layer of dukkha is understood, another may appear.

### **Practical Methods: "Reverse Engineering" and "Catching it Live"**
Two main investigative approaches are discussed:
*   **Reverse Engineering:** When you are already in a state of dukkha (e.g., anxiety), deconstruct it. Trace back the thought patterns and perceptions that led there.
*   **Catching it Live:** The more effective method is to maintain mindful awareness (*sati*) to see the very moment a wholesome state turns into an unwholesome one, observing **dependent origination** in real-time.

### **Key Analogies & Insights**
*   **Snowboarding:** Initially, practice requires great effort to correct hindrances (like braking on a snowboard). As skill develops, it becomes effortless and joyful (like smoothly carving down a slope).
*   **Sports Coaching:** A wise practitioner, like a good coach, adjusts their strategy in real-time based on what's working, rather than stubbornly sticking to a failing plan.
*   **The "Spark" of a Teacher:** While the Dhamma is universal and can be practiced independently, a good teacher or community provides the essential "spark"—direct guidance, inspiration, and correction that books alone cannot offer.
*   **Solving the Root Problem:** By learning to end dukkha, you solve the fundamental problem behind all life's relative troubles. The resulting peace and satisfaction are presented as the ultimate achievement.

### **Conclusion**
The talk concludes by reiterating the profound, yet practical and scientific, nature of the Buddha's teachings. It's a path of **experiential learning**—moving from theoretical understanding to embodied wisdom by continually investigating the mind, developing the skill of happiness, and enjoying the "ride" of life with balance and clarity.

**In essence:** The discussion moves from analyzing a common social ill (gossip) to deconstructing the universal mechanism of suffering (dukkha), and finally to outlining a practical, skill-based path of mindful investigation for overcoming it.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors and stories** to explain meditation, overcoming unwholesome habits, and the nature of suffering (Dukkha). Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors & Analogies:**

1.  **Skill Development / Learning a Craft:** The practice of meditation and overcoming hindrances is repeatedly compared to learning a skill.
    *   **Tennis:** Trying to hit a ball over the net and getting immediate feedback on whether it worked.
    *   **Snowboarding:** At first, you brake constantly, your legs are tense, and you fall. As you get better, you "carve" effortlessly, and it becomes fun—like a musician playing a solo. This illustrates how dealing with hindrances becomes more streamlined with practice.
    *   **Medical Doctor:** A doctor who stops learning after med school will have outdated skills compared to a new student, emphasizing the need for continuous practice and investigation, not complacency.
    *   **Engineer:** An engineer doesn't ask "why" in a philosophical sense but focuses on **"how"** a system works. Practitioners should be like "inner engineers," reverse-engineering their suffering to see how it functions.

2.  **Sports Coaching:** A stubborn coach who refuses to adjust strategy when losing is compared to someone who clings to a spiritual method even when it causes continued suffering. A good coach adapts in real-time to the opponent's weaknesses, just as a practitioner must adjust their approach to mental habits.

3.  **The "Pile of Dirt":** Achieving a wholesome state is likened to digging yourself out of a dirt pile to stand victoriously on top. People may throw more dirt on you (new hindrances), and you must wipe it off, but you can learn to enjoy being on top of the pile.

4.  **The Hunter:** Developing keen awareness is like a skilled hunter in a forest who can hear a twig snap 20 yards away, having a 360-degree awareness to spot the "formations of Dukkha" as they arise.

5.  **Reverse Engineering:** Understanding suffering is compared to a military reverse-engineering captured enemy technology. You deconstruct the finished product (your present Dukkha) to see how it was built. Even better is to watch it being built in real-time (seeing Dukkha arise as it happens).

6.  **Math Teacher / Student:** A teacher walking a student through a math problem step-by-step is like a Dharma teacher guiding someone from suffering to a wholesome state. True learning happens when the student then practices and solves problems on their own, making mistakes and correcting them.

7.  **Riding Down a Mountain of Snow (Life):** Life is an endless mountain of snow. Most people are blindfolded, falling repeatedly, and lying in the snow feeling sorry for themselves. Practice is learning to enjoy the ride, and when you fall, investigating *how* you lost your balance so you can get back up and continue.

### **Stories & Anecdotes:**

1.  **Childhood Social Bonding:** The talk opens with the relatable story of children in social groups bonding by gossiping about or excluding the "weird kid." This is presented as the foundational habit of using judgment and exclusion to build self-worth, a pattern that continues into adulthood with politics, class, race, etc.

2.  **The Person with a Bad Look:** The scenario of walking past someone with a angry or mean face is used as a recurring story. It illustrates the choice point: you can let their expression trigger your own past conditioning and rejection, creating a hindrance, or you can maintain your own uplifted joy, potentially affecting them positively.

3.  **The Stock Trader (Superstition vs. Skill):** A stock trader who attributes a successful trade to a random event (like a stock dropping on a specific day) is used as an example of **superstitious learning** versus **valid skill development**. This contrasts with the immediate, verifiable feedback of Dharma practice.

4.  **The Believer with "Faith":** The story of someone who, when presented with logical evidence against their belief, simply says "I have faith" is used to contrast blind belief with the **experiential conviction** developed in Buddhism, which is based on seeing what works to end suffering here and now.

**Overall Theme:** The metaphors consistently frame Dharma practice as a **practical, learnable skill** rather than a mystical or philosophical belief system. They emphasize **experiential learning, immediate feedback, adjustment, and the gradual development of proficiency** in managing one's own mind and finding happiness.
