### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Hopefully other people will join. Let's see here. Which is pretty cool, Jimmy. Just pouring some mango juice here. Mango juice is delicious.

**Speaker B:** I just ate a whole mango, it was pretty good too.

**Speaker A:** Nice, man. Now this mango juice I got, try to make sure it's like the best mango juice. It's like naked. It's called naked mango juice and no added sugar, so that's good.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, mango is quite sweet already. So, oh yeah.

**Speaker A:** So how has your Dharma practice been going?

**Speaker B:** It's been going so-so, I guess. I've not been practicing that much lately, like there were other things happening, but I think I've practiced a lot already and I'm at a good point where I don't need daily practice, I think. I probably should still do it, but it's like, it's not so much of a worry right now. So that's good.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's good, man. Yeah, in a weird way, real Dharma practice is when you kind of stop needing to focus and do things so strongly. But maybe just like hit balance when the mind's disturbed and just kind of do a little course correcting. It's like sailing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, it's always the question, what is practice, right? If you mean by practice, you know, getting deep breaths and, you know, thinking that everything is fine. And then I've been doing that, but I like— I didn't sit down that much recently.

**Speaker A:** Well, yeah, the practice is basically just breathing and relaxing and being satisfied with the way things are here and now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Basically.

**Speaker B:** I mean, it's winter here where I live, so it's quite cold. But I've been taking hot baths, which are making me quite satisfied. So that's a good thing going.

**Speaker A:** See, you're practicing. That's a good Dharma practice, hot baths.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Quite relaxing, pretty satisfying too.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, totally. Tulah. It's getting hot in here. It's a bit warmer today.

**Speaker B:** Where are you at, in which state?

**Speaker A:** Illinois. Okay, yeah, not too sure.

**Speaker B:** Is Illinois like a warmer climate or is it like on the colder side?

**Speaker A:** It's colder, but it has all the seasons. It has hot-ass summers and cold-ass winters, but it's kind of more known for being colder. But like I said, it has a very like 2.5-month hot-ass summer. 2 to 3 months. And it's lovely. A lot of people complain about the weather, but I like.

**Speaker B:** The weather, really. It's the weather. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's good at helping us, of teaching us to be satisfied with the way things are.

**Speaker B:** Happy and all, or be satisfied with the complaining. Sometimes I just really like to complain about the weather, and that's like good too.

**Speaker A:** Nothing wrong with a little complaining.

**Speaker B:** And it's like, it's like such an easy way to do small talk, complaining about the weather. Like everyone, everyone has It's in the Vedana.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, it only becomes a problem when it really starts making you dissatisfied or others dissatisfied.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But if it starts disturbing us, then it can be something that we need to change a little bit.

**Speaker B:** Because it.

**Speaker A:** Can be a lot of things, like almost like You know, drugs and addiction, you start with a little, you're like, oh, I can handle this, but before you know it, find yourself in a bad place.

**Speaker B:** And that's kind of slippery talk.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's kind of how the Samsara is, you know, just develop these habits and we stick to them because we're creatures of habit. And it's very subtle and insidious at first. Before you know it, you're walking around miserable. You're like, how did this happen? Well, from a Western society with a habit of complaining all the time. But if you just remain aware of what's happening, it's an easy fix, a very easy fix. Yeah, nothing to do, nowhere to go. No complaints, nada. So yeah, what should we talk about?

**Speaker B:** I mean, I've been thinking about Zen. I mean, I'm probably too much intellectualizing it, but I'm thinking about, you know, in Zen writings and in other Buddhist scriptures, it's like, it's often said that, you know, you have to see things as they are, you know, just each moment and just see them, you know. And there's sometimes the claim that you kind of get a better understanding of how things are if you're like this, but it's kind of a problem because like our senses are filtered by our minds already, right? So So I'm not really seeing things as they are, you know, like I'm seeing them with my eyes and stuff like this. So the question really is, do we even get a higher sense of truth or anything? Like, do we really see things as they are? Is it just okay just experiencing them? If it's just about experiencing and Does it mean that, like, I don't think there's actually a higher truth claim or a higher insight that you have by just experiencing it. It's just another way of experiencing, but I don't actually think that there's like a— I mean, it's good for well-being, right? But I don't think there's necessarily a higher truth claim that comes out of that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, higher truth is kind of like a— it's like another carrot people want to chase, you know, when in actuality it's not about— like Dhammarato says, it's not about getting it right, it's about getting it joyfully, you know. Not so interested in the questions and answers and being and becoming and birth and death, more so interested in just the way things are happily. You know, it's such a relief to not have to get Dharma practice correct.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I get what you're saying. I'm just thinking about it because it's like, um, I mean, I think, I think they're saying that's, that's correct practice or good practice anyway. But I'm reading Zen stuff and it's like a lot of Buddhists are like, yeah, you know, you get kind of more wise and stuff like this. You gain something, right? Like, it's like, okay, if you just experience things, if you do it joyfully, you gain some sort of insight. But I don't necessarily think that's true. I think it's just, it makes life better, I guess. And like, that's enough. Who could want more? But it's like I don't think there's necessarily a better understanding of the world anyway. I think that is a— maybe, you know, if you think— I feel like if you think about it too literally, it's like, okay, you kind of push your ego a little bit, you know. And maybe you shouldn't do it. It's just what it is. It's just joyful experiencing something or experiencing the moment. It doesn't give you more wisdom or insight or anything.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the typical Western mindset is really involved with either gaining or loss, trying to gain or running away from loss. And Zen is like the middle way. It's the Dharma practice is the middle way of not so much about gaining or losing, trying not to lose, but more so just being content with the way things are. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** I think sometimes it's good to not be content with the things they are. I think like, because I've talked with other people too, other Buddhists too, and they're like, okay, And Dhammarato says that too sometimes. But okay, what he's saying is, okay, or what is meant is, okay, you should do things joyfully, you know, you should practice in the moment and stuff like this. But then some people say, okay, I don't want to interact with the world or, you know, with the news or stuff like this because it's making me feel bad. And I think correct practice prevents us from feeling bad or suffering from it. You know, you can feel bad, maybe sometimes it's good to feel bad, but we shouldn't like turn away from things and seeing things for how they are. Like, I think if you practice correctly, you don't have to be afraid of how things are and seeing them as they are.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's good too to make the distinction between— when I say being content or turning Dukkha into Sukkha, it's not so much that a lot of people, I believe, will make the assumption that, oh, my brain must be joyful at all times. But the brain by its nature is not joyful at all times. And I think that's what more you're alluding to. And that's kind of— we're on the same page. The brain is not always going to be happy. The brain is not always going to be joyful. But this is bodily joy, bodily boredom, bodily hate, bodily anger. These are all these things. And it's almost like there's two types of being content. There's striving and trying, which is most normal, kind of trying to be content no matter what, no matter what. And then there's the content that's like, my brain is going to do what it's going to do, this biological mechanism. It arises and falls. It's going to go through its own natural course. Can I be okay with that? That's a different content. And I think it's similar to what you're trying to allude to.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I get what you're saying. I'm just saying that I think good practice, you know, I sometimes feel like when you're Buddhist, especially in the Western world, you're sometimes kind of an outsider, maybe, like you're not, like, you know, the Christian, like many people are 100% of the time.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** It'S crazier than the next one. Yeah, some Buddhists are like, okay, you have to, you have to practice inward perfection, more or less, like, okay, you have to get yourself good, basically, and to have away from all the other things. But I feel like good practice should enable you to interact with the world and interact with bad things, so you can do change too. Like, I think that's a good thing. Like, it doesn't matter what you do, but Like, of course, it shouldn't be— it shouldn't turn into this whole huge thing that just causes you suffering. But I think practice should prevent you from having the suffering and not turning away from the thing wholly so that there is no interaction with it at all.

**Speaker A:** Almost a better way of describing it would be like There's physical pain that comes with thoughts, feelings, and emotions, and physical anguish. But suffering is when you're attaching to those. So in one sense, it is good to say, like, to annihilate suffering, you know. It can be tricky with words, you know what I mean?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, sure.

**Speaker A:** Because there's discontent to the body, like I was saying earlier. But what I believe the Buddha was talking about when he was talking about suffering, or It's like what Dhammarato is talking about. It's like dissatisfaction with the way things are. You know, dissatisfaction. And dissatisfaction is not a problem. And like you were talking about too, once you become okay that dissatisfaction is a part of life and it's just a biological chemical that flows through the body, it's nothing to be cultivated. It's not worth anything. It's just Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta— thoughts, feelings, emotions. Ageing, sickness, death. It is impermanent, unsatisfactory by its very nature, and inherently empty of a permanent self, aka not worth clinging on to, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think, I think that's, that's true. I think that's, that's it. But it's just like, okay, some Nirodha. Yeah, I guess, I guess, I guess the important distinction is like there are unpleasant things happening, but what's important is not avoiding unpleasant things and not necessarily seeking them out to prove anything, but to not suffer from unpleasant things. Like there's a difference between feeling something unpleasant and suffering from it, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the difference between somebody in the ocean being cast about by the tides and waves, banging themselves against rocks, or a surfer riding the waves that occasionally gets scraped up by coral and rocks. They're both kind of going through the same thing, but it's the attitude and it's the view and it's the awareness of the other one that turns all that what could be Dukkha, just basically mental anguish, into something that's way more pleasant and joyful. You know, he's riding the waves of life, but the other one's not on a surfboard. The other one doesn't know, never learned how to surf, aka the Dhamma practice. They're both going through the same life, both going through similar circumstances, not entirely exactly, but You know what I mean? Just one's a better surfer. It's just an analogy. It's not like perfection, you know. It's not like, well, the other one could be happy even if they don't have a surfboard. It's like, that's going beyond the analogy, you know.

**Speaker B:** It's just a simple— Yeah, I get it. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** That's why analogies are fun. They have purpose to get a point.

**Speaker B:** The questions I have then is like, okay, what do you even practice? Like, isn't that okay if you're just okay with dissatisfaction? Like, a negative feeling arises and you're just okay with it and you say, okay, this is bad, but it will change. And I'm not— this is its momentum. Sure, but if you feed it fear.

**Speaker A:** Feed it your attention and awareness, what happens? It gets cultivated and grows. But if you're okay with a little anxiety, oh, it'll pass. If you're okay with a little fear, oh, that's natural, it'll pass. It has no chance to grow because you pluck it out before it even gets its roots in the ground, you know what I mean?

**Speaker B:** Sure, but what do you practice then? Like, what do you actually practice?

**Speaker A:** We're gardeners. Like Ajahn— what's his name? Thich Nhat Hanh, he said we're all gardeners of the mind. We're just tending to our garden. That's the practice as gardeners. A little dukkha arises and we pluck it out. And just like you're saying, you know, you can't always get rid of dukkha forever. It's part of life. But it's not a problem for the gardener. But for the inexperienced gardener just going through life, they got a whole garden filled with weeds and brambles and they don't know where to begin. So what is the practice? It's the practice of cultivating peace and joy and turning Dukkha into Sukkha. It's gardening the mind. Are you good at gardening the mind? You know, if Dukkha arises, dissatisfaction, are you good at talking with yourself and seeing it for what it is, seeing through the illusion of what that dissatisfaction really is? That it's not you, it's just a passing phenomenon, not important, not to be taken too seriously. It serves a purpose and then you just take that purpose and just do what you will in the physical reality. And if it doesn't serve a purpose, then you just ignore it. But not ignoring it in a passive sense, ignoring it in a changing sense. In this essence, the ignoring those things will be the positive change that comes. So we're all just gardeners. We go through our day with our minds, our garden, and as Dukkha, dissatisfaction, arises, instead of getting angry, we may breathe and relax. We may go for a walk. We may look at that anger and see that it's an illusion. And there's many different ways to practice this, but usually, basically, it's all Anapanasati and also Sati. You know, it doesn't have to be the breath. It could be concentrating on positive things. It could be concentrating on the moment. We're just shifting our awareness really playfully, easily, not forcefully. That's the practice. And over time, you see that you kind of become bulletproof. It doesn't mean that everything's going to go perfect for you. It doesn't mean that you've somehow found a way to escape the slings and arrows of life. No, we're still partly human. We're still going to suffer everything that everybody else suffers. But we don't have to suffer it in the normal way. You know, we can actually find joy even, and pluck out that suffering and dukkha as it arises, thereby freeing ourselves from the cycle of birth and death. These words are just guidelines. There's no perfect word that's going to solve everything. The closest the Buddha could come was dukkha dukkha Nirodha, and also pointing towards the Noble Eightfold Path. It's basically just breathing, relaxing, smiling, chilling out, and we have enlightenment. We have Nibbana. That's really just a cool mind. Nothing fancy or miraculous in the classical sense, but miraculous in a noble sense that we no longer are slaves to.

**Speaker B:** The.

**Speaker A:** Pitfalls of the mind, to the ups and downs of the mind like a sailor shipwreck in the ocean.

**Speaker B:** We're.

**Speaker A:** More like the cool surfers that are just like, oh, this happened, this bad thing happened. Well, I didn't want it to happen. I tried to logically and reasonably avoid it, but it still happened. Well, I guess that's just— it is what it is. Say love you, que sera sera, whatever will be will be, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I kind of get it, but my question is, but isn't that then more just so like an understanding, or, you know, an attitude. Like, so many, so many people are, oh, you gotta practice this, practice that, and you gotta practice, practice, practice. But really, like, it's just, okay, things, things are impermanent, things change, you're gonna be fine again. You don't— like, this, this relieves suffering already, right? Because, you know, okay, this might be bad, but all bad things happen— stop— all good things stop, but all things— all bad things stop too. And like, isn't that just an understanding? Okay, I guess you, you gotta remind yourself, but like, what, what is there then to actually practice? Like, when you have this and understand this, what's— what's— what practice do you need?

**Speaker A:** Practice is remember to look and change. Remember that if something's agitating your mind, even something as pure-hearted as trying to get Dhamma practice right, you have to see that it's slightly, subtly disturbing you and make a change. And that change in this instance would be like, what is Dhamma practice? It's just don't worry, be happy. Not getting it, not worried about getting Dhamma practice correct like everybody else. What a lighthearted, what a light, fun thing that feels like when you're not obsessed with, this is the way Dharma practices, this is how it has to be. This is basically just chilling out, having fun, having a good time, you know. Not a good time like, oh, I need to keep having a good time, like a party. I don't like— no, if it rains, it rains. If it snows, it snows. If I get sick, I get sick. If I get healthy, I get healthy. Whatever it may be. In the physical realm, I'm like a computer. I just do my diligence to try and get by this world the best I can for me and my others in a logical, reasonable, moral way. And that basically takes care of everything else, because that's what Kamma is. Kamma is when you're muddying the water with your own bullshit. Life's like a still forest pond, you know, and then Kamma is like you trying to trying to control everything, you getting angry, you getting frustrated. It's like, and then you act out on that anger and those bad habits, and then that creates ripples and muddies the water in real, uh, in this reality, in this physical realm. But if you're always cool as a cucumber and just remember, like Ramana Maharshi says, not to react to anything, is all the spiritual practice you need is to chill out and not react to stuff so, so passionately or violently. You create no Kamma even if the anger does exist in the brain on some level. That's okay. There's no problem with anger. The problem comes when you take your anger out on your girlfriend or take your anger out on your kids or take your anger out on your boss. That causes all kinds of problems. Or if you take your anger out on the guy on the street, that causes all the problems. If you take your frustrations, insecurities, fears out on others, that's the problem. Out on yourself, that's the problem. But if you have a little insecurity, you breathe, you relax, you see that its nature is fleeting, it does not last, it's impermanent, you relax and it passes. That's the trick. That's the whole real magic trick is that we take refuge in the breathing, in the relaxing, so those emotions have time to pass and not get cultivated into something more ugly, you know.

**Speaker B:** Sure, I would agree that ethical behavior is very important, like not creating suffering for other people.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, if you're satisfied, what could you possibly create that would harm others or yourself? If there was anything, it would be completely accidental and not have anything to do with with your intentions or actions really, aside from accidents. And even that, it's like, you know, if I'm satisfied, I'm not going to hurt anybody's feelings. If I'm satisfied, I'm not going to hit anybody. I'm not going to steal or manipulate or lie. If I'm satisfied, I'm just happy as a clam. So like Dhammarato says, it's like, just do the practice and then the morality, you know, it comes with it. It's the fruits of the practice. You become satisfied, then all of a sudden, like, hey, I don't need to steal these jeans. I'm satisfied with these ripped jeans. Maybe if I want to do it ethically, then I'll save more money and buy some more jeans. That's a better way to go about it. That won't cause suffering, really.

**Speaker B:** You know.

**Speaker A:** Or sometimes stealing may be the ethical thing to do. A child is starving and he steals a piece of bread, and you caught him and you let him go. There's other ways too, you know, but it's just basically living a compassionate, simple, peaceful life, being a simple man, helping. Zen Master Seung Sahn said Buddhism is the trees are green, the water is flowing blue, and the dog is barking woof woof, and the birds are tweeting tweet tweet. And if some creature comes to you and needs help, you help her. And that's Buddhism. It's just the way things are, and not causing problems. Then what Kamma is there? What Kamma is there for the hermit in the forest, or for the peaceful farmer who has no intention whatsoever in his bones to hurt anybody? Maybe perhaps unless he thinks it's ultimately defending them, but there's nothing that comes from that. No anguish, no Dukkha. They don't even have to be Buddhist. They could be Christians. They've never heard of the Buddha in their life and they're perfectly enlightened masters. They just call it by a different name, maybe. Maybe being a simple man, that's what.

**Speaker B:** They call it, maybe.

**Speaker A:** Peaceful man, maybe. Some may call it the Holy Spirit or whatever. That's the wonderful thing about Buddhism. It's not like other studies, like the Dharma practice. It's not like married to any specific idea other than chilling out with things, and that causes us a lot of satisfaction. You know, we're not obsessed with calling ourselves Buddhist. No, I'm a Buddhist, I'm this, I'm that. We're not obsessed with ego trips, you know. That doesn't mean we're perfect. These bodies may stumble and fall. That's okay. But over time with practice, we fix all of that stuff, you know. In no time we fix all that stuff. That's why silence is the best teacher, man. It's like words are just guidelines. They're just fingers pointing to the moon. But real silence, there's no up or down. There's no right or wrong. There's no evil or goodness. There's just the truth, the Dharma, inside everything in this reality, inside and outside of it. It's just peace.

**Speaker B:** I would, I would say, okay, I, I think there are some evil things, and I think, um, sometimes there needs to be something done about it, you know. Like the Nazis are bad, for example. I don't think anyone is disagreeing, but sometimes this stuff around the house, you know. Sometimes I need to fix something or clean something, and I'm like, and I'm not doing it, and then I kind of get annoyed with it. And it's like, okay, this annoyance pushes me to do things. So it's not a bad annoyance, it's kind of a good annoyance.

**Speaker A:** And we put expectations on that, like you were just saying, was very interesting. And I always love— I use it to this day, what Dhammarato always told me and everybody else, Good enough is okay. And I use that for my cleaning too. And ironically, I think it pushes me to clean better than I otherwise would have. Because before I didn't need to be perfectionist and then everything just kind of goes to shit because I don't want to clean because I didn't enjoy it. But now when I clean, I say, oh, this is good enough. I clean the pot good enough. I'll clean it again tomorrow to make sure I get all the gunk off before I use it. And it's relaxed and I enjoy cleaning. Ergo, everything becomes more clean in my house. Isn't that funny?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's like I've tried doing, you know, Zen practices. Like sometimes it's doing housework and sometimes it's cleaning and stuff like this. But sometimes I'm just really annoyed with cleaning. Like I do it, but I'm really fucking annoyed with it because it's like I don't want to, but it needs to be done. So it needs to be done. It's nothing, nothing I can do against it. But it's like, okay, when I'm annoyed and I'm angry because I need to clean, I noticed, okay, now I'm cleaning extra good because I put all this anger into cleaning. And it's like, it's— so I feel like it's sometimes a good thing to not be satisfied, or sometimes it's good to be a little angry. Like for example with cleaning, like, okay, I'm angry with cleaning, now I'm cleaning better. So it's not a bad thing, you know.

**Speaker A:** Hey, if it works for you, if you think in those terms, it ain't hurting nobody. Sounds good to me. So many times we can get in our own head and just be like, Yeah, this is like this, and we've all fallen into this trap. Who hasn't fallen? This has to be particularly this way with words and this and that. The truth is it doesn't really matter. It only matters when you bring it up in this moment and start giving it labels and ideas and compartments, you know. Where is the idea that it's good to be suffering or good to be dissatisfied when you're not talking? When you're silent, when you're enjoying the smell of a beautiful flower. That shit goes out the window. It's nothing. There's no teaching, there's no words, there's no English, you know what I mean?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I guess what I was trying to say is sometimes like when you practice Buddhism and stuff like this, you kind of get this feeling, okay, I need to chill out, I need to be satisfied. But sometimes you're just not chilled out, sometimes you're just not satisfied.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's okay. Exactly. Not getting it right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, being satisfied with not being satisfied is kind of— it's kind of paradox, you know, but it's like— the difference.

**Speaker A:** With being satisfied or unsatisfied almost comes from our reflections on it afterwards. In the moment, it's pretty much the same thing. But when you sit there in your room and stew, like, ah, the other week, this guy, he just looked at me the wrong way, man. So it's like, why are you bringing that up? The past is dead. He's gone. Doesn't even remember you. You're here, but here you are like, ah, this thing's this way, man. And in a sense, these humans are us as humans. These humans, they have the power to create these castles made of sand, these thought castles. So there's a thought castle of I'm angry about this guy next to me. There's a thought castle of it's okay to relax. And the thought castle of Four Noble Truths. And the thought castle that it's okay to suffer. Every type of thought, feeling, and emotion that you cling on to, it's okay to cling on to as long as it's not causing Dukkha. And that's kind of what I would attempt to help explain to people. It's like all of us have these thought patterns, feelings, and emotions. They are what they are. Some are helpful, some have more value.

**Speaker B:** Some have less value.

**Speaker A:** But essentially, basically, Generally speaking, all of them are the same. If we cling too tightly to any one of them, they cause Dukkha. You know what I mean?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm just trying to say, I guess, that sometimes it's not even so easy to say, you know, what is Sukkha and what is not Sukkha. Like, like, for example, with the cleaning, you know, like when you, when you read Buddhist sutras and stuff like this, it's always like, oh, anger is an affliction. You need to get rid of that anger and stuff like this. But like, I mean, what I do think is important is acting the best you can with other people, right? But I think it's like not so easy to say sometimes what's suffering and what's not suffering. Like, I think suffering is when you It's difficult to even say what suffering is exactly. I mean, everybody knows suffering, right? But sometimes suffering is even good. Like it leads you to change things or something. You know, it's not always so easy to say what is good, what is bad.

**Speaker A:** Weeds in the gardens, you know, when we pluck them out of the garden, You throw them on the leaf pile and they turn into nutrients for the yard. Without any dead weeds, there would not be a garden at all. It's part of life. And like Ajahn Samatha says, it's not desire that's the problem, it's the attachment to the desire. It's not necessarily the Dukkha that's the problem, it's the attachment to the Dukkha, the bad habits.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but I mean, yeah, it's— for example, I stopped smoking last year, and I stopped smoking not because it was like good for me or anything, it was like I became really annoyed with it. I thought it was really stupid because I'm doing this, it's good for me, and— but it was really annoying. But this annoyance was like, okay, with this annoyance, with this negative thing. I was like, okay, this, this made me stop smoking. So it was not a bad thing at all. So sometimes it's difficult to say what's, what, what is suffering, what is not suffering. I think, I think sometimes when I practice, I have a too simplistic kind of view on what is suffering. Like, some things are just Just okay.

**Speaker A:** Like— And we don't always have to define it. We don't always have to say this is this, this is that. It's okay letting it be ambiguous, or if even if it's difficult to describe, that's okay too. Some things are easier to describe, some things are more difficult.

**Speaker B:** You know.

**Speaker A:** Nobody'S putting a gun to our head like say define suffering, define Dukkha. I'll say dissatisfaction, you may say something else. It's all just words, dogs barking, like Uche Krishnamurti says, just talking. But you see, it's getting too abstract. We keep it real world, you know? And part of that keeping it real world is making some balanced definitions, is saying like, Dukkha just means dissatisfaction, dissatisfaction that's causing you really bad discomfort. And you need to just chill and relax with all things. Let go of all these things that are causing you these problems and breathe and relax. You see, if we keep it balanced, there is some definitions. You don't have to be married to the definitions, but it is good to have a yin-yang, you know what I mean? If we get too loose, like, who knows what Dharma practice means, then we're not— it's more difficult to practice because people are scratching their heads like, what the fuck are these guys talking about? And that's why Dhammarato comes in so handy, because even sometimes I can be flowing and philosophical, get off track, and I talk to Dhammarato or something, or hear him talk, and he's just like, Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, don't worry, be happy. You know, turning dukkha into Sukkha. You have to get it right, you just have to get it joyful. Like, oh yeah, it is pretty simple, yet he's describing it using definitions, semi-solid definitions, and It's there and it's a useful tool. You know, if we get too abstract with it, if we get too, what is this? What is this? What good is it aside from interesting philosophy? Which is fine if that's the thing, you know what I mean? But ultimately the Dhamma practice is about the balance, is about the middle way. Not getting too obsessed with the past or the future, but staying right here, making things simple. Not necessarily throwing out language, but not necessarily not using it for what it is. You know what I mean? Not letting, like Ajahn Chah said, not letting our kuti, hut, go to disrepair, go into shambles, but also not being obsessed with over-cleaning it and over-fixing it, but a nice balance of keeping your house in order the best you can, you know.

**Speaker B:** Balance.

**Speaker A:** A lot of people, they're so smart that they overthink themselves out of bliss. You know, it's like my plate's dirty after eating, do I clean it? Do I clean it well? Do I clean it with 3 amounts of power, 4 amounts of power? It's like, you're finished eating, just put your dish in the sink, buddy. What are you banging your head against the wall for? It's not rocket science. You know?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I just, I think sometimes I put too much emphasis on like, okay, being joyful, because sometimes I'm just not joyful. And it's like, if I then start to worry about, okay, I'm not joyful now, I should be joyful, that's like, that doesn't help like anyway. So it's like, okay, I've gone over to being just, okay, if I'm not joyful, I'm not joyful, that's okay too.

**Speaker A:** Like We're basically saying the same thing. We're on the same page. Yeah, and that's kind of the art of Dharma practice too, is maintaining conversations or talking to others about the Dhamma and finding ways to attempt to do it in semi-interesting ways. But it's all just this simple thing said in various ways. But it's good to always come back to that simple core: Dukkha, Nirodha to help remind us because we forget, you know, we forget and before we know it it's subtle, we're lost in our Dukkha and we're like, what's happening? I should be happy, I'm an Anicca, and we lost sight of the Sati of remembering, remembering to look and make a small change if necessary, playing with it, not going crazy with it, just playing with it, the mind, you know, building a nice garden. It doesn't have to be perfect or pristine, it's good enough, good enough. And what you're basically saying, if I can say see if this is accurate. You tell me, I don't know. But you're basically saying with your mind, good enough is okay. And with your Dharma practice, good enough is okay. And it seems like your practice is very good enough.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's, it's, um, um, I should have put it— it's, it's, it's kind of weird sometimes because like, um, When you actually feel like you're suffering for some reason, and then you practice the Dharma and you do your breathing or your meditation or whatever one does, it becomes this very powerful thing, you know, which is— it makes a real difference. But if you're not suffering, if everything is going all right, it's not it doesn't feel so powerful and it's like the need to do it isn't there and it's like, okay, I don't need to practice so much because it's like everything is fine, like I have nothing to worry about.

**Speaker A:** In a way, just chilling out and relaxing is practice. It's a living practice, it's a living Dharma, it's the Buddha. You become a Buddha when you're just like, oh, I'm just chill, everything's fine. And that's what you're describing. You're just a Buddha, a living Buddha. Congratulations.

**Speaker B:** I wouldn't go so far, but do you know what I mean? Like, sometimes the practice is such a powerful thing, you know, and sometimes it's just, yeah, okay, like I do meditation and sometimes it's It's really powerful. And sometimes it's just okay, I sat for half an hour and did nothing. I just sat there, but nothing happened, nothing was going on. It's like, okay. But sometimes it's like this really powerful, blissful thing. I think it may be when you're actually suffering, when you're stressed out, and when you actually need to sit down and then you do it. And then it's like, okay, now you feel the difference. But when everything is all right, it's like there's not so much difference, because why would there be?

**Speaker A:** And that's— he's just describing reality. It's waves up and down, up and down, and you're just riding the waves. Sometimes you feel like that, sometimes you don't, as Dhammarato says. And that's the beauty of the Dharma practice is it's like one of the only things I've ever found that just allows things to be as they are and not forcing things to be other than what they are. You know what I mean? It's like everything we're taught in life is force, race, run, educate, be the most smart, the smartest one, be the most educated, get the degrees. It's like, it's so nice to be part of groups that are not looking at materialism as some kind of checkered flag, or like gaining the most money is a checkered flag. But really, it's like we all have the checkered flag already. We're all winners already. That's such a beautiful thing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And I think That's true. Like, like having, having a group, that's really great. Like, for example, um, in my work, it's like, or, or what was my work? It's like, okay, I was, I did customer service things, right? And it's like, okay, when you, um, you have, um, you kind of have to treat people differently, right? If somebody spends €10,000, it's like different than someone who spends like €50, right? And it's like, and everybody treats them differently, and it's a different thing, right? But in reality, one guy is just like an asshole with less money, and one is an asshole with more money, right?

**Speaker A:** They come in all shapes and sizes.

**Speaker B:** But it's like when you're out in society, sometimes like people really think that if someone has like large amounts of money, they have to be treated with more respect and like they are some person just because they have more money. And it's like, it's really weird because it's like, it's so— it's not— it's like not an honest thing. And it's like, it's good to practice Dharma with people who are like, okay, all that stuff doesn't matter too much. It's just, you know, very different.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, very different value system indeed. We cherish joy and peace and simplicity and balance and and love and being here now. And it's a wonderful thing. That's when I talk to people who don't practice the Dharma really, or not into Buddhism or the Dharma practice, I really notice such a contrast, especially because it's been a few years now I've been in this particularly this Sangha. And it's so lovely to talk to different people, even through chats or just on video. But then when I'm talking to, quote, normal people, regular people outside of this, it's also good practice because I see the stark difference between what I'm striving for, not in a race-running way, but what I kind of striving in just grasping what's already there sense versus the grasping of the regular people who is very blatant to me that it's causing them Dukkha, you know. And they're a good, in a sense, traffic marker for me, like slow down, you know, because you don't want to end up like them. You don't want to end up where you're not even enjoying your life. You're just, I got to do this, I got I gotta do that. Everything's a problem. Everything's a fucking thing. Everything's drama. You know, it's like, no thanks.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I, I do understand why people become monks. It's, it's nice to wonder. I mean, they're like, I guess they're, uh, quote unquote bad monks too, but it's, it's, um It's nice to know that not everyone has like this, this weird value system where, you know, status and money and all those things are the most important thing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's a, it's a great hope, it's a great pleasure, and that's why I think the Buddha incorporated it into, you know, the precious jewels, you know, Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha. And not just Sangha like in an organization type of like this Sangha, this like Sangha of brotherhood of truth and sisterhood or whatever of truth coming together and peacefully and simply and just expressing the beautiful Dharma, the joy of being here and now. And it's wonderful, man. And then at the end of my life, someday when I'm an old man, it's like, I'm gonna look back at all these conversations. It's just a very, very simple, beautiful thing, a very lovely thing to talk with other people interested in this stuff.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I agree.

**Speaker A:** Right. So, well, you rock, brother. I better get going, man.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, see you. Goodbye.

**Speaker A:** Much peace and love, dude. Great talking.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and a Sangha friend (Speaker B), here is a summary of the key themes and insights:

### **Core Message: The Essence of Practice is Simplicity & Satisfaction**
The central teaching reiterated throughout is that genuine Dhamma practice is not about complex philosophy or strenuous effort, but about **cultivating satisfaction (Sukkha) and joy in the present moment**. The ultimate goal is to "turn Dukkha into Sukkha"—to transform dissatisfaction into contentment by changing our relationship with experience.

### **Main Themes Discussed:**

1.  **What Practice Really Is:**
    *   It is **not about daily formal meditation** alone, but a continuous, gentle "course-correcting" of the mind, likened to sailing or gardening.
    *   Practice is **breathing, relaxing, and being satisfied with the way things are here and now**. Even simple acts like enjoying a hot bath can be Dharma practice.
    *   The attitude is key: "It's not about getting it right, it's about getting it joyfully."

2.  **Dealing with Difficult States (Dukkha):**
    *   The aim is **not to avoid unpleasant feelings** (like anger, annoyance, or cold weather), but to **stop suffering from them**.
    *   The difference is between *feeling* an unpleasant sensation and *clinging* to it, which creates mental anguish. The practice is to see these states as impermanent (Anicca), unsatisfactory (Dukkha), and not-self (Anatta), allowing them to pass.
    *   **"Good enough is okay."** This principle, applied to tasks like cleaning, reduces perfectionism and makes action more relaxed and effective.

3.  **The Role of Insight and "Higher Truth":**
    *   The discussion challenges the pursuit of "higher truth" or special insight. The real "magic" is in the **pragmatic result**: a peaceful, joyful life free from being a "slave to the pitfalls of the mind."
    *   Intellectualizing can lead to overthinking; the practice is about **direct experience and a lighthearted attitude**.

4.  **Engagement with the World:**
    *   Good practice should **enable engagement with the world**, including its difficulties (like bad news or necessary chores), without being overwhelmed.
    *   It’s about developing resilience—like a **surfer riding waves** instead of being battered by them. Ethical behavior naturally flows from a satisfied mind.

5.  **The Paradox of Satisfaction:**
    *   A key point of agreement is the importance of **being satisfied even with dissatisfaction**. It’s okay to not feel joyful sometimes; the problem arises when we resist that state and create secondary suffering.
    *   The mind's natural fluctuations are accepted. The practice is to **"remember to look and change"** playfully when agitation arises, not to force a constant state of bliss.

6.  **Value of the Sangha (Community):**
    *   The conversation highlights the importance of a community (Sangha) that shares values of **peace, simplicity, and presence**, offering an alternative to societal values centered on status, money, and constant striving.

### **Key Analogies Used:**
*   **Gardening the Mind:** Weeding out dissatisfaction (Dukkha) and cultivating joy.
*   **Sailing/Surfing:** Making gentle corrections and riding the waves of life's experiences without being wrecked by them.
*   **A Still Forest Pond:** Kamma is like muddling the clear water with our reactive "bullshit"; a calm mind doesn't disturb the water.

### **Conclusion**
The talk demystifies practice, framing it as the everyday art of finding contentment through relaxed awareness, ethical living, and letting go of clinging—especially to the Dhamma itself. It emphasizes that peace is found not in gaining something special, but in a simple, joyful acceptance of "the way things are."

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors** and **stories** to illustrate their points about Dharma practice, mindfulness, and life. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Metaphors**
1. **Sailing / Course-Correcting**  
   - Speaker A compares Dharma practice to sailing: when the mind is disturbed, you do a little “course correcting” rather than forcing things.

2. **Gardening the Mind**  
   - Speaker A expands on Thich Nhat Hanh’s idea: we are “gardeners of the mind.” We tend to our mental garden, plucking out weeds (dukkha/suffering) when they arise, cultivating peace and joy.

3. **Surfing the Waves of Life**  
   - Speaker A contrasts someone being tossed in the ocean (suffering) with a surfer riding waves (skillful practice). Both experience the same waves, but the surfer has awareness and skill, turning potential anguish into something more manageable and even joyful.

4. **A Still Forest Pond vs. Muddy Water**  
   - Life is compared to a still forest pond. Karma (or unskillful action) is like stirring up the water with anger or control, creating ripples and muddiness. Being “cool as a cucumber” keeps the water clear.

5. **Drugs and Addiction as a Slippery Slope**  
   - Speaker A compares complaining or negative habits to addiction: it starts small (“I can handle this”) but can subtly lead to a “bad place” if we’re not aware.

6. **Building Castles Made of Sand**  
   - Thoughts and emotions are like “castles made of sand”—mental constructs we build and cling to, which can cause suffering if taken too seriously.

7. **The Carrot on a Stick**  
   - Speaker A describes the pursuit of a “higher truth” as a “carrot people want to chase,” suggesting that Dharma is more about joyful engagement than attaining some abstract ideal.

### **Stories & Analogies**
1. **The Cleaning Analogy**  
   - Both speakers discuss cleaning as a practice. Speaker A uses “good enough is okay” to describe a non-perfectionist, relaxed approach that ironically leads to better cleaning. Speaker B shares how annoyance with cleaning can sometimes fuel more thorough action—showing that not all “negative” energy is unskillful.

2. **The Starving Child Stealing Bread**  
   - Speaker A gives an example of ethical complexity: a starving child stealing bread might not be seen as creating negative karma if the motive is survival, illustrating that morality is contextual and compassion-based.

3. **Customer Service & Money**  
   - Speaker B shares a story from customer service: people are often treated differently based on how much they spend, but in reality, “one guy is just like an asshole with less money, and one is an asshole with more money.” This highlights the illusion of societal values compared to Dharma values.

4. **Quoting Teachers**  
   - The speakers reference stories or phrases from teachers like **Dhammarato** (“It’s not about getting it right, it’s about getting it joyfully”), **Ajahn Chah** (not letting your hut go to disrepair nor obsessively over-cleaning it), **Ramana Maharshi** (“not to react to anything is all the spiritual practice you need”), and **Zen Master Seung Sahn** (“Buddhism is the trees are green, the water is flowing…”).

5. **The Computer Analogy**  
   - Speaker A describes the physical realm as being like a computer: we do our diligence logically and reasonably, without emotional interference, to navigate the world.

### **Key Themes Through Metaphor**
- **Practice as Balance**: Not forcing, not neglecting, but adjusting like a sailor or gardener.
- **Suffering as Manageable**: Like weeds, waves, or muddiness—something to be worked with, not eliminated entirely.
- **Joy in Simplicity**: Letting go of the “carrot” of higher truth and finding contentment in “what is.”
- **Habits as Insidious**: The slow, subtle build-up of negative patterns (like addiction or complaining) that can lead to misery if unchecked.

These metaphors and stories help ground abstract Dharma concepts in everyday experiences, making them relatable and practical.
