### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Well, let's do it. Alrighty. So, so, Rick, do you have any topics you'd like to discuss today before we jump into the dialogue?

**Speaker B:** No, let's dive right in. Okay, I have something I'm preambulating already, so go ahead. Yeah, that's fine.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So one thing I've noticed this week that's been really beneficial for my practice. So I recently read the book by Bhante Vimalaramsi about Tranquil Wisdom Insight Meditation, and this can be a whole other talk, that book. So I'm just going to focus on one small part where he talks about how any tension or stress that one notices, like in one's consciousness, is a form of craving. That's a form of either desire or aversion. And aversion is also a form of desire, right? And so I've started noticing that. And when I notice any tightness or tension in my perception, I'm learning to disengage from the thoughts about that and just notice that tightness as Dukkha, you know. And then I look for another place in my awareness that is more expansive and calm and happy, or is expansive, calm, and happy. And that's been really powerful, like, as far as practice off the cushion goes in particular. Because it takes the Dukkha out of the game of thought, which a lot of this dialogue by Plato we're about to discuss is about, and brings it into the physiological realm. And it's way easier, I find, to call a spade a spade when you start to see Dukkha as physiological as opposed to merely a mental thing. Because sometimes I would debate with myself, is this really an unwholesome thought? Or, you know, is this like something I should actually, you know, be concerned about? You know, let's say like I'm worried about paying the bills or something. Is it unwholesome to be worried about paying my electric bill? You know, saying, thinking to myself, oh, I have to pay that, you know, or not. And you can argue with yourself about it. And the fact is, paying the bill is pretty wholesome, actually. But once you start thinking and you develop some kind of a mental and then emotional attitude towards it of, say, worry or aversion or whatever, that's where Dukkha is created. So if you just notice the tension that comes up when you start thinking about that, then immediately it becomes clear what it is and you can throw it out. And so I'm finding my nervous system actually to be better, a better Dhamma tool for me than my mind, which has been a pretty interesting insight.

**Speaker B:** So you mean your system has become less nervous?

**Speaker A:** There you go.

**Speaker B:** It's just a system now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, just a system.

**Speaker B:** Not nearly as nervous.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's funny why they call it a nervous system, right? You know, like why that particular word? But yeah, it's been a big improvement in terms of my ability to discern between Dukkha and non-Dukkha, you know, joy, bliss, expansion, expansive awareness. Et cetera.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I like your example of the, like, of, let's say, like, having to pay a bill or having liquor. But I see those thoughts as the first one is just a reminder, like a little alarm, like a notification, like a mental notification. At that point, after it's been brought to the attention once, then I think it has the potential to move into Dukkha, as you said, because of the attachment to emotion or the constant recycling of the same thought, or the struggle against it, all of that. But the notifications, I think they're helpful, actually. And I don't see them as— I mean, they're necessary. They're necessary because of the kind of postmodern society that we live in. We constantly have to be notified of XYZ variables so that we can maintain, as best we can, our ship on the waters of this culture. But yeah, after that, yeah, it's not helpful any longer. And I guess generally in my day-to-day, I'll just kind of almost be grat— like have a gratitude toward it. Okay, thanks for the notification. And then I'll take care of that at X date. And then I'd let the thought go. I let the notification go. And if it returns, I go, remember, I have the date, back out again.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, there we go. That's great. Yeah. It reminds me of a podcast I just listened to over the weekend. It's a conversation between Delson Armstrong and Daniel Ingram. I've listened to it before, like a year ago on Guru Hikin.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I've I've watched that one as well. Is that the one where they— there was an interesting question about.

**Speaker A:** I think.

**Speaker B:** Steve asked them, you know, could someone who's steeped in the Dharma and on like XYZ path have sociopathic tendencies? And Ingram was like, absolutely, we see it all the time. And Delson was like, nuh-uh. Yeah, that's the shorthand version. I know there was more. It was a lot friendlier than that, but that's— I remember that kind of like point of friction between the two on that. Was that the same talk?

**Speaker A:** That was the same talk. Okay. And that's a whole other conversation, but— Absolutely. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** I'm just trying to orient which one you're talking about. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And the reason I brought it up is there's an interesting part of the conversation. Also, this actually ties into that topic too. Okay. Of like, would an Arhat, you know, how would an Arahant experience putting their hand on the stove, right? And assuming the stove is burning, right? Sure, sure. Or some other, you know, physiological pain, right? Like, and there's actually a part in the suttas, according to the guys on the call, that when the Buddha is near the end of his life, he gets some kind of disease in his abdomen, in his bowels. And he actually kind of complains about the pain, maybe not the way we would normally complain today, but he says something along the lines of, you know, this suffering, or this, maybe not the suffering, this pain is tremendous. You know, so, you know, along those lines, and the conclusion they came to is that, you know, an Arhat, an enlightened one, for those that don't know the term, is, you know, subject to the same physiological system as any of us. So, you know, the Buddha felt the really bad abdomen pain, you know. However, they would probably, you know, in some sense feel less pain because they don't identify with it and attached to it. And that they're just experiencing pain without all the additional of, oh my God, I can't believe this is happening to me. Right? Oh my God, it's so terrible. Oh my God, this is gonna happen forever.

**Speaker B:** You know, there's no overlay, there's no overlay of suffering on top of the physical suffering. There's no mental anguish that ties in the way we would, like if we suddenly get a tightness in our chest, rather than just experiencing it and recognizing, oh, perhaps it's time to go to the hospital. There would be the, uh-oh, what does this mean? Uh-oh. And then all the scenarios play out, whereas an Arahant wouldn't. They would just— they would take the necessary action, but without all this negative Dukkha strings that they quickly attach and go, what does that mean for my life? What does that mean for me? What will happen? Yeah, yeah, I know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, for sure. And And another way that it's talked about is, you know, all things have Anicca, right? So, you know, Dhammarato, you know, has talked before about how his teacher, John Poe, said that a Srotapanna is a Srotapanna some of the time, you know, and an Arahant is an Arahant some of the time. And, you know, they're not always 100% of the time exemplifying Srotapanna or Arhat.

**Speaker B:** Right, because then that goes back to the idea of perfection. And perfection is literally just a concept.

**Speaker A:** Yep.

**Speaker B:** It's a concept. And how can one, especially one who hasn't, let's say, had these experiences, how could they precisely know anyway, you know.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, yeah, for sure. Oh, Pietro, great to have you on. How are you doing, guys?

**Speaker B:** Hello, good.

**Speaker A:** How are you? Oh, fine, thank you. Great. Okay, what was up? Are we already in a topic? Um, kinda. We're doing the intro topics, just whatever anyone wants to bring up. So right now we're discussing, um, pain and our hot shit and that type of thing. And our big topic for the day is going to be the dialogue Euphifro by Plato. So, um, yeah, that's where we're at. So anyway, and anything you want to bring up too, Pietro, feel free. So after we wrap up this pain topic. Um, and I— yeah, but, uh, anywho, um, so what were you saying, Rick?

**Speaker B:** Not sure. Oh, I remember. No, no, I found that— I found the train. I got back on the train. Um, just, just how— and again, this is like a little tangent, but how The very concept of enlightened or Arahant or whatever is again very conceptual, and different traditions have their ideas of it, different people have their ideas of what that must be. And there seems to be kind of a consensus of— I think people associate it with some sort of perfection, perfection of no suffering, perfection of— transcendence of suffering. But there could be like, like either an exaggeration of that, you know, based throughout time, over time, throughout the traditions. Or maybe it's just a matter of maybe wishful thinking. Like, of course I want my teacher to be perfect, one of the perfect ones.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** But, well, just having a physical form necessarily means some sort of physical suffering, you know. It's just automatic. It's just automatic.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, absolutely. And it's really easy to just investigate that right away. So if an Arahant gets a rock falls on his head and he gets brain damage Arya gets Alzheimer's, or she, by the way, could be a she, you know, they're probably not going to be an Arahant anymore, you know, especially if they have Alzheimer's, right?

**Speaker B:** So I forgot how to be enlightened. Yeah, I completely blew my mind. It blew out of my mind. That's right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So there's all kinds of ways you know, that might not even involve them stepping off the path, but just some natural thing happens to them and they're no longer an Arhat, right? Including death. You know, when you die, where's the Arahant? Well, they're gone. We don't have any immortal Arahants yet. You know, the tech isn't quite, quite ready for that yet. But But yeah, so even that, you know, is an impermanent state, which is actually— we had a conversation about that in the Sangha US on Friday with one student, you know, kind of declaring that this was a permanent, you know, undefeatable state, and Dhammarato basically saying no. Yeah, Anicca.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely, that's back to wishful thinking. It's back to wanting to think there is a state beyond suffering, beyond change. But then you're starting to push against the Noble Truths. You know, it doesn't go against the four big tenets, right? There is impermanence. Even our Arhatship is impermanent. Absolutely.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Even maybe within the same lifetime. Absolutely. Yeah. Everyone's an Arahant until they talk to their sister.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Everyone's an Arahant until they talk to their children.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. The good old Ram Dass quote, "You think you're enlightened? Go visit your family.".

**Speaker B:** Go visit your family and you'll find out real quick who's enlightened.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** The ultimate test. That's funny.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely.

**Speaker B:** But I understand, I mean, for a lot of people it feels like.

**Speaker A:** Their.

**Speaker B:** Motivation to practice is to reach this exalted state. And that's fantastic, but at the same time they're kind of setting themselves up for some disappointment. They are.

**Speaker A:** And I also want to point out, like, one of the great things that Ram Dass is saying, you know, in that quote, and Rick's version about the sister specifically— my sister— yeah, yeah. Um, is it implies that one should test, you know, themselves. One should test one's own attainment. Maybe not that they should that it can be beneficial, right?

**Speaker B:** I think, I think, I think they'll be tested either way. Like, life, life is its own test. I don't think you need, I don't think you need to go out and seek it out at all. I don't think you need to.

**Speaker A:** I agree.

**Speaker B:** You know, it's, it's not like you're, you know, let's say a highly trained martial artist and you're going to go out to the, the east side and, you know, with some $100 bills strapped to your shoulders to see, see how good you are. You don't need to, you know, just continue to live and, you know, the slings and arrows will find you either way. There's no need to seek it out, you know, it's up and down, the wave continues.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, I totally agree. Whether you like it or not, life is going to test you.

**Speaker B:** It'll find you, it'll find you, it'll, you know, circumstances will find you. The wonderful thing about the practice is you will be ready for any moment, you know.

**Speaker A:** So there's actually another great story Dhammarato tells, this one about there is a monk in one of the monasteries he's affiliated— he was affiliated with, um, who did like a 3-year silent retreat, you know, and he was totally blissed out for much of that time. And at the end of the retreat, he went in a car, you know, he had to go on a car ride. And as soon as he— they started driving, the Dukkha came back. And he was not really mentally prepared for the car ride. And that raises the question, you know, what was the purpose of the 3 years if all it takes is a simple car ride to destabilize your little bliss that you have, right? Your mucho bliss, perhaps, right? So I think there's benefits to both on-the-cushion practice and off-the-cushion practice. And if one part of that equation is seriously neglected, you know, there's danger for Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Right, it's sort of like the vegan or the vegetarian that's super strict and adheres to only certain types of foods, uber healthy, and that's laudable. However, if they find themselves in circumstances where that food, that very specific food, isn't available, How is their system going to react when, you know, they get a little grease and fat and salt in there? You know, it's going to be— it's going to rebel, it's going to reject it, it's going to experience a lot of physical suffering as a result because they lost that conditioning in a way. You know, they're existing on the pure cosmic, you know, gluten-free universe, geez. But they've forgotten that the majority of the world isn't eating that stuff. And so it's my sort of more gross version of what you're talking about with jumping from retreat to retreat without ever seeing how it's going to meet the road, just by living in the dusty world the way we do.

**Speaker A:** For sure. There is actually a word for this. It's called hormesis. And what hormesis is, is basically the process by which many biological organisms react to stress, where first the stress comes in and they benefit from a certain amount of stress. And then once the stress is too much, they start losing instead, and they actually do not benefit. So there's actually like a hormetic zone. I can show you guys here this little chart. So this is like a really simple way of looking at it, where when you have some stress, you're actually strengthening. And there's like a maximal zone after which your benefits begin to decline, and then you begin to weaken. So here's another chart that shows the same, where you have your maximum response here, and then you have your threshold, and then you have your loss of capacity. So we all ideally want to be somewhere here if we want to grow in whatever area. Like, weightlifting is like a really popular example, right, where you want to— you're not going to gain strength if you don't add a certain amount of stress. However, if you add too much, you can become injured, and then your weightlifting endeavor is over. And that applies to anything, basically. So stress can be helpful for the system. It can in certain doses.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely. But of course, we can't always dictate how much is coming into the system. We have very little control over that. And so it's helpful, I think, just to, you know, again, to continue to investigate regardless of what's incoming into the system.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And hopefully it'll be enough when you're really tested. You know, death of a loved one, loss of a limb, you know, fortunes are shattered, lost, life savings gone, you know, civil, you know, unrest, upheaval, you know, major issues, uh, you know, you'll be at a point where you're still fairly peaceful despite the fact that, you know, things are churning at a rate unbeknownst to you prior.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and that's why the Dharma is so valuable, is because it's like a meta skill. It's like a skill about skills, right? You know, where you're not only learning how to react to one situation, you're learning to react to all of your life, you know, any stressor in your life. And that makes you more resilient, you know, over time.

**Speaker B:** That's right, Wu Wei. Don't resist the water. It's much more powerful than you. Learn to float, learn to dive, learn to move with the currents, because it's going to take you where it wants. You are just along for the ride, folks. You're just along for the ride. The more you relax, the better.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely. Anywho, we've been going on for around 40 minutes now. So Pietro, do you have anything? Or shall we just go into the dialogue? I think we can get into the dialogue. I really appreciate this first part of the call. Awesome. All right, well, thank you, Rick, for closing us out on that one. Sure. Let's start the dialogue here. All right, so this is the Euthyphro by Plato. So the way we're going to do this is, this is actually kind of long, so this could even be two calls. It's about 16 pages, although it's in script format, so, you know, it's not like a full 16 pages really. But so I'm going to introduce it and do kind of an overview, and then when this is finished, well, we can do some key lessons. And also, Rick and I are going to do like a little shall we say, like, like play reading. So Rick can take on the role of Euphifro. I can take on the role of Socrates, unless you'd rather change that, Rick. I'm fine.

**Speaker B:** I'm good with it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay, cool. And yeah, so just a little overview. So this dialogue is one of the most famous Platonic dialogues. And it gets at the crux of many of Plato's ideas. I think we could actually even do a full series on Plato because there are so many great dialogues. But the basic gist of it is Socrates, who is the teacher of Plato, who may or may not have been a real person, but he never wrote anything down himself. He had this habit or pastime Liking to go to the agora, which is like the central marketplace, and just kind of interrogate people about their lives. You know, why are you buying this? Why are you doing that? Why are you here?

**Speaker B:** What a legend. Yeah, what a— what an effing legend, man. Yeah, imagine, imagine going to your, to your nearest mall and accosting people about their consumeristic tenets. Why do you need that? Oh man, mall security would be on you. Anyway, go ahead. Just a funny aside. It's really, really hysterical to think that he did that back in the day.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it is. And, you know, people usually didn't appreciate it. And Euthyphro is one of the people that did not appreciate what Socrates was doing. And it eventually got to the point where Socrates was accused by the courts of corrupting the youth of Athens, because he would get kind of like these followers, people that would follow him and participate in the same activity. And Plato was one of them when he was a young man, and that's how he met Socrates. And then Plato's the one that wrote down all the things that happened, or invented them. But anyway, that's up for debate. But long story short, Socrates was quite famous for investigating and interrogating everything, using the tools of dialogue and philosophy. And ultimately, he was charged with corrupting the youth. And then put to death. So they actually sentenced him to death, and he had the option of either death or exile, and he chose death. And he also chose to be the one to administer his own death. So he ended up taking suicide by committing suicide by hemlock. And he actually went out in quite a happy way. He wanted to be surrounded by all of his friends. And that's another great dialogue. That's actually my favorite one that could be up for discussion, the Trial and Death of Socrates. It's about 2 to 3 small dialogues, actually. So anyway, so carrying along here. So, so Socrates is at the market. He comes across this pretty arrogant religious person, Euthyphro, and Euthyphro is about to bring a case against his father for killing one of his slaves. And he claims that the reason he is bringing this case against his father is because he displeased the gods. And Euthyphro is a very pious and religious man, and he would never do such a thing. And his father angered the gods by doing this. And Socrates ends up interrogating Euthyphro about the nature of piety you know, which you can also talk about is virtue and its connection to religion. So it's very interesting dialogue. And a couple of side notes here. So in Greece, you know, at this time, not today, fortunately, you know, slaves were considered, you know, basically property. And committing some kind of accusation against one's parent or an inquisition of any kind was considered a grave sin. So, you know, or they didn't have the language of sin back then, so a grave transgression, right? So, you see, Pharaoh is actually a kind of, you know, exiled from his family, his friends. He's held in ill repute simply because he is pressing a case against his father for damaging his property, right?

**Speaker B:** So he's a bit of a pariah, right, in a way? And interestingly, like Socrates is as well. So these are kind of like two pariahs going at it.

**Speaker A:** Here. Exactly. And actually, at the beginning of the dialogue, Socrates first kind of befriends Euthyphro over the fact that they're both pariahs, so which is an interesting part. So anyways, I'm going to read this intro first, then we'll start the dialogue. The scene is the agora, or central marketplace of Athens, before the offices of the magistrate who registers and makes preliminary inquiries into charges brought under the laws protecting the city from the gods' displeasure. There, Socrates meets Euthyphro. Socrates is on his way to answer the charges of impiety brought against him by three younger fellow citizens, on which he is going to be condemned to death, as we learn in the Apology. Euthyphro has just deposed murder charges against his own father for the death of a servant. Murder was a religious offense since it entailed pollution, which, if not ritually purified, was displeasing to the gods. But equally, a son's taking such action against his father might well itself be regarded as impious. So impiety or piety, you can also talk about as virtue, right? Like just good, bad, etc. Euthyphro professes to be acting on esoteric knowledge about the gods and their wishes, and so about the general topic of piety. Socrates seizes the opportunity to acquire from Euthyphro this knowledge of piety so that he can rebut the accusations against himself. However, like all his other interlocutors in Plato's Socratic dialogues, Euthyphro cannot answer Socrates' questions to Socrates' satisfaction or ultimately to his own. So he cannot make it clear what piety is, though he continues to think he does know it. Thus, predictably, Socrates' hopes are disappointed Just when he is ready to press further to help Euthyphro express his knowledge, if indeed he does possess it, Euthyphro begs off on the excuse of business elsewhere. That which is probably what would happen with anyone if you interrogated them at the market. Though Socrates does not succeed in his quest, we readers learn a good deal about the sort of thing Socrates is looking for and asking his question 'What is piety?' and the other 'what is' questions he pursues in other dialogues. He wants a single model or standard he can look to in order to determine which acts and persons are pious, ones that give clear, unconflicting, and unambiguous answers. He wants something that can provide such a standard all on its own, as one of Euthyphro's proposals, that being pious is simply being loved by the gods, cannot do says one needs to know first what the gods do love. Pious acts and people may indeed be loved by the gods, but that is a secondary quality, not the essence of piety. It is not that which serves as the standard being sought. There seems no reason to doubt the character Socrates' sincerity in probing Euthyphro's statements so as to work out an adequate answer. He has in advance no answer of his own to test out or to advocate. But does the dialogue itself suggest to the attentive reader an answer of its own? Euthyphro frustrates Socrates by his inability to develop adequately his final suggestion that piety is justice in relation to the gods and serving and assisting them in some purpose or enterprise of their own. Socrates seems to find that an enticing idea. Does Plato mean to suggest that piety may be shown simply in doing one's best to become as morally good as possible? Something Socrates claims in the Apology the gods want more than anything else? If so, can piety remain an independent virtue at all with its own separate standard for action? These are among the questions this dialogue leaves us to ponder. So, and another thing to pay attention to in this dialogue, which the intro mentioned, is the way Socrates interrogates Ethipro, and in general interrogates ideas, right? And when we talk about investigation in the Dharma, we generally talk about, you know, trying to see things clearly. But there's multiple different types of investigation, right? You know, one can investigate, as Rick and I talked about earlier, you know, through investigating just the nervous system. You know, or the system, if one is not so nervous, you know, what are you feeling? What are you seeing? What are you hearing, etc.? And another form of investigation, which is what Socrates is all about in this dialogue, many others, is that of logic, dialogue, analytics, you know, thinking things through, etc. And That is quite an interesting way to investigate something, and it's also valuable. And that's, you know, really something to pay attention to in this dialogue. So Mr. Rick, the first line, take it away. Now, Euthyphro. So Rick will be Euthyphro, and I will be Socrates in this dialogue. So Euthyphro, take it away. All right.

**Speaker B:** What's new, Socrates, to make you leave your usual haunts in Lyceum and spend your time here by the King Archion's court. Surely you are not prosecuting anyone before the King Archion as I am.

**Speaker A:** The Athenians do not call this a prosecution, but an indictment, Euphro.

**Speaker B:** What is this you say? Someone must have indicted you, for you are not going to tell me that you have indicted someone else.

**Speaker A:** No, indeed.

**Speaker B:** But someone else has indicted you?

**Speaker A:** Quite so.

**Speaker B:** Well, who is he?

**Speaker A:** I do not really know him myself, Euphipro. He is apparently young and unknown. They call him Miletus, I believe. He belongs to the Piti and Dem. If you know anyone from that Dem called Miletus, with long hair, not much of a beard, and a rather aquiline nose.

**Speaker B:** Quite a description.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** I don't know him, Socrates. What charge does he bring against you?

**Speaker A:** What charge? A not ignoble one, I think, for it is no small thing for a young man to have knowledge of such an important subject. He says he knows how our young men are corrupted and who corrupts them. He is likely to be wise. And when he sees my ignorance corrupting his contemporaries, he proceeds to accuse me to the city as to their mother. I think he is only one of our public men to start out the right way. For it is right to care first that the young should be as good as possible, just as a good farmer is likely to take care of the young plants first, and of the others later. So too, Meletus. He first gets rid of us who corrupt the young shoots, as he says, and then afterwards he will obviously take care of the older ones and become a source of great blessings for the city, as seems likely to happen to one who started out this way. By the way, just to point out here, it's very interesting how Socrates mocks the accusations against him and speaks like in a very respectful way of Meletus, but also a mocking way. And he also shows that he has a lot of detachment to his own— like, these are various serious charges against him that can result in his death, and he has like this very mocking, detached attitude towards it, even though he knows he's probably going to be found guilty. So you can see Socrates is clearly someone that has developed a lack of I, me, and mine. I don't know if I would call him attained or anything, but there's certainly some lack of attachment going on, which is definitely positive. So take it away.

**Speaker B:** I could wish this were true, Socrates, but I fear the opposite may happen. He seems to me to start out by harming the very heart of the city by attempting to wrong you. Tell me, what does he say you do to corrupt the young?

**Speaker A:** Strange things to hear him tell it. For he says that I am a maker of gods, and on the ground that I create new gods while not believing in the old gods, he has indicted me for their sake, as he puts it.

**Speaker B:** I understand, Socrates. This is because you say that the divine sign keeps coming to you, so he has written this indictment against you as one who makes innovations in religious matters, and he comes to the court to slander you. Knowing that such things are easily misrepresented to the crowd. The same is true in my case. Whenever I speak of divine matters in the assembly and foretell the future, they laugh me down as if I were crazy. And yet I have foretold nothing that did not happen. Nevertheless, they envy all of us who do this. One need not worry about them, but meet them head on.

**Speaker A:** So just to give a little context about the divine sign, So Socrates— this is actually another sign of no 'I' mean 'mine'— is, you know, people would ask Socrates, where did you get all these ideas? You know, where did this questioning come from, etc.? And he would say, oh, it's not me, it's a spirit. A spirit comes into my body and gives me all these ideas. And it's not clear as to how serious Socrates was about that. But it is interesting that he did not attribute his own intelligence to himself, and he actually referred to it— this is where the word genius comes from— is he referred to it as his diamond. So also demon is related to this. So he would say, my diamond gives me all of my ideas, right? And The diamond is related to the word jinn, you know, which is like a kind of like a demon in, in say, you know, Arabic language, which is related to the word genie, you know, someone that grants wishes. And you see that etymology comes up to genius, right? So as this all kind of originates with Socrates talking about the spirit, the spirit of genius that would give him his ideas.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato and Sangha friends, is an informal dialogue exploring practical insights from Buddhist practice, interwoven with philosophical discussion. Here is a summary of the key themes:

### **Core Practice Insight: Using the Body to Detect Dukkha**
*   **Speaker A** shares a breakthrough from reading Bhante Vimalaramsi's *Tranquil Wisdom Insight Meditation*. He focuses on the teaching that **any tension or stress in consciousness is a form of craving** (desire or aversion).
*   **Practice Method:** Instead of getting caught in mental debate about whether a thought is unwholesome (e.g., worrying about bills), he **shifts attention to the physiological sensation**—the "tightness" or tension that arises. He recognizes this directly as **Dukkha (suffering/stress)**.
*   **Key Shift:** He then **disengages from the thought narrative** and finds another area of awareness that feels **expansive, calm, and happy**. This makes the Dharma more tangible and easier to apply "off the cushion," using the nervous system as a primary tool for discernment.

### **The Nature of Suffering and Enlightenment**
*   The group discusses how an enlightened being (an **Arahant**) would experience **physical pain**. The consensus is that while they would feel the sensory pain, they would **not add the mental overlay of suffering**—the "oh no, this is terrible" narrative, fear, or identification with it. They would experience pain with equanimity and take appropriate action without anguish.
*   They challenge idealized notions of enlightenment as a **permanent, perfect state**. Citing Dhammarato's teacher, they note that a stream-enterer is one "some of the time," emphasizing **Anicca (impermanence)**. Even enlightenment within a lifetime is not an immutable state and can be affected by circumstances like brain injury or Alzheimer's.
*   The humorous quote, "You think you're enlightened? Go visit your family," is referenced as a **test of one's practice in challenging, relational environments**.

### **Balancing Retreat and "Real World" Practice**
*   A story is shared about a monk who was blissful on a 3-year silent retreat but quickly became distressed during a simple car ride afterward. This highlights the **importance of integrating off-cushion practice**.
*   The discussion warns against creating a sheltered "bliss bubble" that can't withstand the grit of daily life. Practice should build **resilience for inevitable life challenges** (loss, illness, upheaval).
*   The Dharma is praised as a **"meta-skill"** that increases overall resilience by teaching one how to relate wisely to *any* stressor.

### **The Concept of Hormesis**
*   **Speaker A** introduces the biological concept of **hormesis**: a beneficial adaptive response to moderate stress that strengthens the system (like weightlifting), whereas too much stress causes breakdown.
*   This is applied to spiritual practice: some **stressful life experiences can be growth opportunities**, but we often can't control the dosage. The Dharma helps us navigate this skillfully.

### **Transition to Philosophical Dialogue: Plato's *Euthyphro***
*   The group transitions to a study of Plato's dialogue *Euthyphro*, which explores the **nature of piety/virtue**.
*   They draw a parallel between **Socratic investigation** (using logic, dialogue, and questioning to uncover truth) and **Dhamma investigation** (using mindfulness and bodily awareness to see reality clearly).
*   They note **Socrates' detached, non-self-referential attitude** even when facing death, seeing it as an example of reduced attachment to "I, me, and mine."

### **Overall Tone and Message**
The talk is conversational and exploratory, emphasizing **practical application over dogma**. Key takeaways are:
1.  **Turn to the body** to detect the root of Dukkha.
2.  **Enlightenment is not about perfection** but about the end of *mental* suffering and a profound understanding of impermanence.
3.  **Test your practice in daily life**, not just in isolation.
4.  **Wisdom can be cultivated through multiple modes of investigation**—both somatic (body-based) and philosophical/intellectual.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the dialogue, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by the speakers:

### **Metaphors**
1. **Notifications / Alarms**  
   - Speaker B compares thoughts (like remembering to pay a bill) to helpful notifications or alarms. The first reminder is useful, but dwelling on it creates suffering.

2. **Ship on the Waters**  
   - Speaker B describes navigating modern life as keeping “our ship on the waters of this culture,” implying stability amid chaos.

3. **Overlay of Suffering**  
   - Both speakers describe how an enlightened person (an Arahant) experiences pain without the mental “overlay” of anguish, fear, or storytelling.

4. **Testing Enlightenment**  
   - The “Ram Dass quote” metaphor: “You think you’re enlightened? Go visit your family.” Enlightenment is tested in challenging relational dynamics.

5. **Hormesis Curve**  
   - Speaker A introduces the concept of *hormesis*—a biological metaphor where moderate stress strengthens, but too much weakens the system. Applied to meditation and life challenges.

6. **Wu Wei / Flowing with Currents**  
   - Speaker B compares resilience to floating or diving in water: “Don’t resist the water… learn to move with the currents.” The metaphor emphasizes adaptability over struggle.

7. **Nervous System as a Dhamma Tool**  
   - Speaker A contrasts the mind (which debates) with the nervous system (which feels tension directly). The body becomes a more reliable guide to suffering than thoughts.

8. **Vegan / Strict Dieter**  
   - Speaker B compares a meditator who only practices in retreat to a strict vegan who can’t handle ordinary food. The metaphor warns against avoiding life’s “grease and fat”—i.e., everyday stressors.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1. **Bhante Vimalaramsi’s Teaching**  
   - Speaker A references the book *Tranquil Wisdom Insight Meditation*, where tension is seen as craving. This frames a personal practice story about moving from mental to physiological awareness of *dukkha*.

2. **Buddha’s Abdominal Pain**  
   - The speakers discuss a sutta where the Buddha experiences severe physical pain at the end of his life, using it to illustrate that even enlightened beings feel pain—but without mental suffering added.

3. **Daniel Ingram and Delson Armstrong Debate**  
   - A referenced podcast where the two debate whether someone advanced on the Dharma path can have sociopathic tendencies. Used to explore the complexity of enlightenment.

4. **Dhammarato’s Story of the Monk on Retreat**  
   - A monk blissful during a 3-year silent retreat becomes distressed during a simple car ride afterward. The story questions the value of isolated practice without integration into daily life.

5. **Socrates’ Trial and Death**  
   - In the transition to discussing Plato’s *Euthyphro*, Speaker A summarizes Socrates’ story: his method of questioning, accusation of corrupting youth, and choice to drink hemlock. This sets up the dialogue’s themes of piety, virtue, and investigation.

6. **Euthyphro’s Case Against His Father**  
   - The plot of *Euthyphro* is summarized: a pious man prosecutes his father for killing a slave, claiming it’s the god’s will. Socrates interrogates him on the nature of piety, revealing his ignorance.

These metaphors and stories serve to illustrate core ideas about suffering, practice, enlightenment, and the integration of spiritual insight into everyday life. They also bridge ancient philosophy (Plato, Buddhism) with modern experiences.
