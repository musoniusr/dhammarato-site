### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Be that document I posted in the group chat. If you get anybody, please volunteer to help out and collaboratively take notes with me. That'd be great.

**Speaker B:** All right, guys. So we called this meeting to follow up with the last meeting where we introduced the idea of proposals and some overall structure for how the organization's going to work, some rough structure. And now we have 3 proposals to go over today in this meeting. 2 of them we're going to ideally be passing, and 1 we'll be discussing. So the first 2 are about choosing the initial board members, who 8 of the 9 of us are here. So we're going to officiate that, and then also starting the process of the 501(c)(3). So most of all the research has been done for the 501(c)(3) stuff, and now we're ready to execute, and especially once the board is confirmed. And the fourth proposal, or the third proposal that we'll be discussing, is about the mission statement. Tyler came up with a rough mission statement that we can all critique, and this can be something that as a board we can refer to, hey, does this match what our mission is for the organization when we're going through any future proposals? Hey, Robert.

**Speaker C:** Hey, other Robert.

**Speaker D:** Yo, yo, what's good?

**Speaker B:** We're just giving a vague structure of what the meeting is going to look like. We have 3 proposals, you might have seen them. We're going to be just I'm about to hand it off to Tyler now who will be talking about the first one, Proposal 2, about confirming the board members.

**Speaker D:** Very cool, very cool. I'm going to whack some headphones on.

**Speaker C:** And then I will join you on the face.

**Speaker A:** Cool, thanks Parker. Let me share my screen. Alright, so the link to this document is also in the meeting notes. So yeah, check those out if you want to kind of look at this and add some comments yourself. So again, just to refresh everybody's memory, I'm not sure if you were there on the last call, we're doing like a proposal system where basically the intent of a proposal is two things. Well, it's mostly just to get us all on the same page about like, hey, do we all like understand what we're trying to do and understand all the implications?

**Speaker D:** Implications?

**Speaker A:** Have we thought through this? And then having a process to say like, hey, like, do we all actually agree on this, how we want to use our limited time and energy? And so currently the way we've been passing proposals is just kind of group consensus because we don't have a board yet. But this first proposal is about choosing a board, and with the boards, one of their primary responsibilities will be to decide whether proposals pass or don't pass. In the future, we're going to open this up more so that some proposals will go through more of like the full Open Saga community rather than just the board. But just to start to keep things focused, it'll be just the board, you know, yes or noing these proposals. So this first proposal here is about choosing the initial board members. So thank you everybody on this call who applied to be a board member, and thank you Parker. Parker had a lot of conversations to everyone to say like, hey, do you understand what's entailed? Because The things that are involved with being a board member involve like reading all of the proposals, going back and forth, doing additional roles and responsibilities, including maybe doing our finances, for example, or coordinating fundraising, right? And so it's not like a trivial commitment. And so everyone who signed up so far is down for that commitment and brings something really like a unique perspective to the table. These are the initial board members we have. I think this is— what is this, 3, 4, 5, 6? We have like 9 people who are— who bring something really interesting and valuable to the table and also are down for the commitment. And so we have Parker's kind of like had, I think, conversations with a lot of individual people as well. And so this would be our initial board, and we were initially planning on something— doing something a little bit smaller to keep it more manageable. But look, we have so many people who are stoked about contributing that we'll start out bigger. We will always have the ability to kind of reduce or increase the board size as things arise. So for example, if you feel that, A, like I can't actually meet this commitment anymore, or we can change this in the future. But this is what we're starting off as. So yeah, I mean, I guess I'll leave it there. And I think for this proposal, so we don't have a board member or a board yet, this will just be kind of by consensus vote, like, are we cool with this board member, this initial board, or list of board members? And so before I jump into that, does anybody have any questions or comments before we do the vote?

**Speaker C:** It's an honor to be on the board.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I feel the same way as well.

**Speaker E:** Cool.

**Speaker A:** Well, it sounds like maybe we're ready just to do a vote. Maybe a quick show of hands. If you approve this, please raise your hand.

**Speaker E:** My hand is being raised right now if you can't see it. I have mine.

**Speaker A:** All right, beautiful.

**Speaker D:** I think that's— I don't know how to raise my hand.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, all right, so I'm gonna call this passed.

**Speaker E:** There we go.

**Speaker A:** And I'll make the decision here as pass as well. All right, beautiful. So this is great.

**Speaker D:** What do I click to raise a hand? I don't know how to— Oh yeah, you're good.

**Speaker A:** I think we got all the feedback from you.

**Speaker D:** Okay, now I see.

**Speaker A:** Nice. So, all right, so this is great, and this is important for two reasons. One is it'll allow— it unblocks Parker to start the process of setting up the 501(c)(3). It's like the last big thing we needed. The other reason it's important is that as we start making decisions, the board, you know, I guess us, everyone here, is going to be voting on like, hey, is this the direction we want to move in? So this next proposal, we're going to have an opportunity to test out our newly found board powers and the board will decide. So everyone who's on this list is going to decide like yay or nay on this next proposal. All right, so I'm going to hand it over to Parker who wants to do the next proposal.

**Speaker B:** Great, thanks Tyler. The next proposal, Proposal 3, I'm going to share my screen here. Let's see. Are you guys able to see this?

**Speaker C:** Not yet.

**Speaker B:** All right, let me try it again. Do you see it?

**Speaker C:** I still can't see it, but I'm not sure if that's the problem.

**Speaker F:** On my side.

**Speaker D:** The screen is blank. It does show a new screen saying that you're trying to show us something.

**Speaker A:** Oh nice, I see it now.

**Speaker B:** Better now?

**Speaker C:** There it is.

**Speaker D:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right, great.

**Speaker E:** Am I supposed to see your screen?

**Speaker G:** I don't see your screen at all.

**Speaker E:** I just see you.

**Speaker A:** I'm in the wrong, uh, maybe because.

**Speaker B:** The mobile screen is small. Maybe you turn it in some direction.

**Speaker A:** Speaker view.

**Speaker G:** What are you looking at?

**Speaker B:** It's not important. I'll just talk about it and you'll get the general idea. So it's the proposal to set up the 501(c)(3). The research and stuff has been going on for a while now, so I just did some rough outlining of what it looks like. So the context and goals of the process to set up the 501(c)(3). Essentially, if we're just a bunch of friends wanting to do some Sangha stuff, We could do that without setting up any formal government structure, but we're going to be accepting donations, and because we're accepting money, we're going to be having to pay tax on that money. But we can get approval with the IRS as a 501(c)(3) organization so donors don't have to pay tax on the money they're giving us. So that's why it's beneficial to set this up. And another point on that is the process. If one is just doing this normally, it would be a pretty long drawn-out process. One of the forms is like 50, 40 pages, but since we don't plan to be accepting more than $50,000 in donations within the first 3 years, the process is shortened a significant amount. So that is the point about the Form 1023 versus the Form 1023-EZ, if you guys can see that. And then how do we start the nonprofit? So we first incorporate, we start a corporation within the, within like a state level, which Since I volunteered to use my address, we're going to be doing it in Arizona. So we start the corporation there, and then once we create that corporation, we get a number and we can get that corporation to get tax approval by submitting something with pay.gov. To do this, though, we need to have articles of incorporation that fit the government standards or IRS standards, and also other documents such as bylaws and different policies. And this is where we've primarily been held up besides getting the board of directors together. So we've decided to outsource this. Chris isn't here, but he found someone on Fiverr that was fairly cheap and also had really great reviews and consistent reviews. So that's what we plan to do in terms of writing these documents of the articles of incorporation and writing the bylaws, because one of us could try and take a stab at it, but there's different language they require and it could be rejected. And the expenses are around $300 to even request approval. So if we get them rejected, in a sense, it's worth paying $100 or $200 to ensure that they'll be confirmed. So that was outlining the context and goals. Now I'm going to talk about the direct proposal. We're going to purchase the premium package from this lady on Fiverr. Anagami, who will set up the— she'll both create the organization at the state level, even though that's a simple thing to do. She's offering to do it, and then she'll— she probably has some templates for these documents that she's talking about. She'll provide those templates and put them into the system that we're going to be using to apply for the 501(c)(3) approval, which is pay.gov. So this, the total adds up to $390. Around $300 of that is the.

**Speaker C:** Government.

**Speaker B:** Expenses, and then around $180 of that is the expenses to Kri Creations on Fiverr. So Matt's generously offered to $500 to cover the process. And since I'm the one handling it right now, he'll forward the money to me, and then I'll then pay for the Cree Creations fiber services plus the government stuff that needs to be covered. And then once that's done, any extra money I'll send back to him. And so that is the service we're paying for. And once that service is complete, there are still a few more things to do. She'll have given us bylaws, which bylaws are like general— when will we meet, what is the limit of the board, how many people are allowed on the board, just various policies. So she'll probably have some template that she gives for that, and then we can go through as a board, hey, how often do we want to meet, what's the limit for our board, what are our roles, and we can clarify that stuff, but we'll have a structure and using language. Let's see. Okay, Joe's saying maybe the numbers here are wrong. I'll go through, we'll fix that once I finish outlining this. And then after that, once we have the bylaws that we agreed upon, we'll have a meeting. This is a traditional thing done. For nonprofits it seems is to have a meeting approving the bylaws, appointing the various officers in the different roles, the director, the treasurer, and whatever roles we decide we'll have, and then we'll need to have the accountant or the treasurer work with the finances and set up a process for reporting the finances every year. So that the one responsibility that we have is to get things going, and then we'll need to on a yearly basis— the form is called Form 990— report our finances. And since we're— and my understanding is that we'll also be able to do that with the 990EZ, which is lot less work. Alternatives, I kind of mentioned this earlier, that we could do it, writing it ourselves, but I don't have that experience. And I tried poking around looking for templates online, and most of them were expensive, like $100. So I thought it would be better to have someone who's approved to do the service, do the service rather than us trying to take a stab at it. And getting something wrong and having the process go on for another 3 months and also having to pay a little extra. So that is the proposal, and I think there were some mismatches with the finances that Joe was talking about. Let's see. I'll pass it on to whoever next, and then we can vote on the proposal.

**Speaker A:** I just had a— or discuss it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, go ahead.

**Speaker A:** A couple of comments on here. So, yeah, this is an awesome proposal, Parker. Thank you for putting this together. This is really detailed and amazing. I guess a couple of things that I think are implied here of like, we have to figure out board roles and our meeting time. And so that should probably be like another proposal we can spin up after this. We create another chat for like all the board members to kind of like iron some of those details out. I just want to like call that out. And then another thing too is that we want to make sure that the bylaws— we already passed like kind of like a rough governance mechanism of like, hey, we're going to like board members vote on these things by supermajority or whatever. Like, just want to make sure that that's reflected in the bylaws, Parker, when you like talk to that contractor. Okay, sweet.

**Speaker B:** All right, so correction, it is $480, and that is covered by the $500 that Matt Hoskins offered. Okay, does anyone else have anything else to say?

**Speaker D:** Yes, if that doesn't cover the amount of money that you need, let me know.

**Speaker B:** Great, and Matt said the same, that he'd be willing to offer more if this isn't enough. Great, so we can now vote with the 9 board members to pass this, and then we'll keep going in the process. Yeah, go ahead, Robert.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I know Chris was in charge of this. What happened to his involvement?

**Speaker B:** Chris and I, he found the person that we're working with, and he's also— we've been talking about it in a separate chat in the governance stuff. He's busy with other projects right now, so he said he wouldn't be fit for a role on the board, but he's been helping out with this.

**Speaker C:** Great, thank you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. All right, great. So we can vote now on whether to pass this. All in favor of passing it, raise your hand. Great, that's everyone.

**Speaker D:** Cool.

**Speaker A:** Well, that was easy.

**Speaker B:** That was. And now we have some discussion on the mission statement of the organization that Tyler will talk about.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, cool. One second here. All right. So I think, you know, as we've been discussing kind of setting up OSF over the past couple weeks, I think, you know, a lot of us have some like vague vaguely different ideas of like what we're trying to do. And it turns out like those vaguely different ideas can really matter in terms of like how we want to spend our energy and like how we want to prioritize what we do next and like the things we create. And so I wanted to create a mission statement where we can— that helps us prioritize and say like, hey, we do this and not this, or this is what we think matters the most. And so this is really meant to be kind of a guiding light so that when we when we're having discussions about what we prioritize or what we do next, the hard part of thinking about like, who are we as an organization, is already thought through. We can reference that mission statement and be like, hey, does this align with our mission statement or not? And so it just makes those kinds of conversations a lot easier and a lot faster. And so I gave my best first stab at one, and this is based off of something that I think Parker and some other folks had written in the past and just kind of add some additional detail, but I'll just read it here. So the Open Sangha Foundation is a grassroots initiative of students and teachers who are building an open and informal Sangha for Western Buddhism. We believe that true Sangha supports practice with Dana rather than transactions, creates family rather than dogma, and encourages integration into Wats rather than individual practice alone. So I'll let that marinate for a second. And I kind of would love to get people's takes on kind of how this sits with them, if they're like, if it captures what we're trying to do well, and like will give us a good guiding light for, you know, when the board is making decisions in the future.

**Speaker F:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] I think it's really good that almost all of it is good, except for using the word Watts, just because we might know what it is, but other people might not know what it is if they first initially come to the organization or read about it or something like that. Before I heard Dhammarato talk about a wat, I had no idea what a wat was. So I don't know if there's a different word to use there.

**Speaker E:** I was also— I mean, I had like a lot of thoughts on it. It's— I think it's a great first stab, but, well, one of the thoughts was like brevity. I haven't looked at too many other mission statements, but I mean, like a lot of the big ones that I know of, they tend to keep it really simple, like 1 or 2 lines. And I wish I had come up with a good one that I thought I would like to use or something, but I didn't really have anything. But like, my mind kept almost generating new things for a mission statement. So like, I just kind of have some things I'd like to add to it and improve with it. But I do like it as a good starter, you know. So like, I Not that I think it's bad or anything, but just there are some ways to improve it. So like, hopefully that's what we'll do by the end of this meeting.

**Speaker A:** Cool. Yeah. And just to build off that thought for a second, like what we could do also, and sometimes done, is splitting into like a mission statement and values. Whereas like a mission statement is that kind of like brief, like what are we doing? Whereas values are like ways of prioritizing. So I kind of like this Dhamma rather than transactions, family rather than dogma or like values. And the mission statement could be something kind of like this, building this informal Sangha, maybe. That's just like an initial idea. But I think something we want to do is make sure that's not too generic and too broad and pithy where we lose its ability to guide our action. And so I think it's really easy to think like things that like Jack Kornfield is doing, for example, could fit the criteria of creating a Western Sangha, right? And it could be confusing to someone who's not familiar with what we're trying to do, like how what we're doing is different from how Western Buddhism has been tried in the past. And so the intention of this section, even though I agree that this can be way better, is to make it really clear how we're different from other approaches to Sangha in the West.

**Speaker E:** For sure. Yeah, adding a little bit more ambiguity would be nice. Because we don't know what it'll transform into, but also you want to have like a distinct idea of what we're offering.

**Speaker C:** Sure. Another comment, I think wat is mostly like a Southeast Asian Buddhist term, and if we're going to be more broad and inclusive and include, say, Tibetan or Zen, etc., they don't use the word wat. I think temple is maybe the most generic term.

**Speaker D:** Yes, but the word temple is the right word to use. That's exactly where they kill animals on an altar.

**Speaker C:** In the old days.

**Speaker D:** Well, still in India.

**Speaker C:** Certainly. Another comment too is the dogma issue, I think could get potentially thorny at some point. You know, I know that, you know, the great philosopher, I think it's Carl Rogers said, or maybe I think it was Karl Popper actually, he said that the ultimate antidote to intolerance is an intolerance of intolerance. You know, so I worry a little bit about the word dogma. I'm not sure if there's a better word that can be used, but I know enforcing against dogma sometimes includes some things that can be interpreted as a bit dogmatic. So I don't know if you want to— you could maybe write creates family through an application of the Dharma or something along those lines.

**Speaker E:** What about something like this along these lines? The Open Sangha Foundation is I really like that it's open, but informal is kind of like iffy too. So I didn't quite— I feel like something is working in my mind, but it's not quite there yet. But what about something like this? The Open Sangha Foundation is a group that is interested in promoting the access and availability of traditional Western Buddhism. So like, we're basically trying to say that we're increasing access, we're increasing the quality of the material because we want people to know that like we're not trying to reinvent the wheel, but we are making it available and like to a new generation. So it is the same old Sangha, the same old wisdom. We're doing it kind of in a different, more new age way. Those are some of the things that I think we should highlight on in our mission statement. That just kind of like we just want to incorporate some element of our goal to kind of open access and really promote like just good traditional Sangha or good traditional wisdom in a new way or something along those lines, right? So we're not talking about what people are doing wrong nowadays. We're only talking about how we want to contribute to the things being done right which kind of keeps it all positive, kind of keeps it open-ended because we're— yeah, that's kind of what I was thinking.

**Speaker D:** Here's a question about that and a couple of things, and that is, who is this mission statement for? Are we going to put this mission statement on our website, or is this going to be merely for the 501(c)(3)? This is— they could be different.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, this is for both, and I think it's important that they're both the same for a couple reasons. One is that, you know, we're decentralized, like we're a decentralized organization, right? Like we have people all across the world contributing. Some of them are board members, some won't be, and we have to have a way to guide the action of all this big decentralized group into like one direction. And so the intention is to use both, and we could always adapt this over time as it changes and as the organization changes. Like, we're not locked in, right? But we want to have a good place to start to kind of guide our action in these early days.

**Speaker E:** Okay, those are good. Some of the things that I— Go ahead.

**Speaker D:** I agree that we can take the word "Wat" out and put the word "Temple" or "Monastery" in. I kind of go for temple rather than over monastery, but we could call it something else. Don't call it.

**Speaker A:** Okay, what is the.

**Speaker E:** Mission of Open Sangha too? Like, let's just talk about that for a second before we talk about how to summarize it in a statement. What is our mission?

**Speaker A:** So actually, sorry, I do have to drop off. I have to head out here, but if y'all wouldn't mind, keep taking notes. This is like an awesome discussion. Please take notes in that document and add ideas of like things that you think would be good mission statements in the meeting notes, and that'd be super helpful. All right, I'll see you guys later.

**Speaker C:** See you later, Tyler.

**Speaker D:** Thank you.

**Speaker E:** Bye, Tyler.

**Speaker G:** Bye.

**Speaker C:** I really like the use of the word grassroots. I think that's very appropriate, and I think it gets to the point of what this is all about, as opposed to it being some kind of a hierarchical or top-down organization. So I fully support the use of that word. And yeah, I just wanted to throw that out there.

**Speaker E:** So yeah, I liked it too. Some of the other words that I liked too was modernized, decentralized, sustainable development and maintenance. Right. So yeah, so like I'd like to include some of those words to really try and capture like What is new that Open Sangha is doing, right? We're in a new age, we got lots of new mentalities, new generations. We're trying to expand the availability as well as the quality of the Dharma to a new generation and create up some kind of structure, sustainable structure that's going to exist after us, right? So those are some of the things that I think are the mission and I want to be a part of our statement. For us as well as for everyone else, just like a— because essentially the mission statement is like a one-liner that you can just give to people who ask you like, well, what is it that you do, or what's your foundation, you know? But.

**Speaker C:** I think you could add to the access of availability, you could add scaling the access of availability, because I think that is what this is about, is to scale that. Right? Because at the moment you have a lot of solo practitioners that may or may not find themselves in Watts, and so you could even add something along the lines of, you know, we are interested in creating a more inclusive Buddhism that improves access to the Dhamma, or something along those lines.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, adding that digital component, we're basically trying to make like Facebook for Dhamma, right? We're trying to add social media, connect the connectivity that social media has to the nonprofit and the Dharma Foundation, because obviously a lot of these noble souls aren't interested in that kind of social media stuff, the access or the availability. However, the way that the modern society is going, like in order to open up the availability to that younger generation, we're going to need to have some kind of connectivity and accessibility on, like, you know, apps like Facebook groups. And, like, basically we're just trying to add connection to this group of noble souls who traditionally don't really connect very much, right? So we're— that's what I feel like part of our essential job is.

**Speaker D:** We could also play with putting the word volunteer in there, as opposed— or making sure that people understand that this is not a paid, salaried organization.

**Speaker E:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** The Grassroots Volunteer Initiative, a grassroots of.

**Speaker D:** Volunteers interested in Yes, a grassroots volunteer initiative.

**Speaker E:** Nonprofit grassroots volunteer initiative or something like that. I feel like we're headed in the right direction. We got kind of the concepts, the ideas, certain words that we want to element or add in. So I think we're cooking with grease now.

**Speaker C:** Oh, I have something to add here. So I would say interested in improving access or scaling access, but maybe improving is a better word. And then you could add after the Western Buddhism, in changing the dynamic of Western Buddhism to be more community-oriented rather than oriented towards the solo practitioner, because that's really what this is about. It's expanding Sangha, not the continued lone ranger in the Dharma, so to speak.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Which I think most of us have been at some point.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, well, you know, it's just part of the traditional mystical journey. You have to go into a cave and you have to do your own thing in a cave for a while.

**Speaker D:** And I'm the Bhante.

**Speaker F:** You know, on the theme that, like, somebody mentioned before of not going with the negative too much, I wonder if the part where it says "dhana rather than transactions," because one, it's very specific, and it's kind of like putting something down. I mean, I don't know if we really want to put down people publicly that, I mean, yeah, we have our own beliefs. I mean, obviously none of us are taking donations to live our lives or whatever. And maybe we're against that, but at the same time, I think there are a lot of people within Buddhism that do just live off of that, and we still want to be friends with them.

**Speaker D:** I don't know.

**Speaker F:** It's just an idea.

**Speaker D:** That's right. That was one of the major mistakes that I think that we made in the early days was if you have the hint of money, they're not welcome. And I think that that's not the right attitude. I mean, can you imagine that students can't get into the first grade until they already know their alphabet? Makes no sense, because they teach the alphabet in the first grade. In that regard, I don't think that we should limit it in that regard, that anybody is welcome. Even Anapanasati is welcome.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I think maybe one thing we should ask ourselves here is how generic do we want to be versus specific? Like, do we have, say, 3 initiatives that we want to embark on, like, say, embracing dharma as opposed to transactions, creating a family environment within the Dharma, and perhaps embracing Sangha as part of the Dharma, or something along those lines. Like, do we want to have specific initiatives here, or do we want to be as generic as we can be in order to pass the mission statement filter, so to speak?

**Speaker D:** I like that, those three things. Yes, we can talk about it. Rather than Donna, we can talk talk about it gift-oriented or gift-based, or we can use the word donation.

**Speaker E:** What is Donna again?

**Speaker D:** Donna is actually the same word in Pali that we have as donor or don— donation. Don, it's the same word. So donation is based upon Pali word and the, uh, Indo-European word. It's the same word.

**Speaker E:** Okay, but like, um, so do— I'm not asking everybody else, I guess I'm asking our expert, right, Dhammarato? Um, do you think that it's better to have the money in the Western— like, so here's the thing, if we are able to Through this Open Sangha Foundation, we can greatly increase the percentage of the market of Western Buddhism that is traditional and non-money-based. Let's assume that we can't reach everybody with our setup. Like, on the one hand, do you think that it's better that some people have a kind of monetized system for spreading Dharma, like Jack Kornfield, if that reaches a section of the market that we could not reach. So like, on the one hand, like, obviously we are not really liking the transactional model, but it seems like that's what Americans respond to in a certain way. So like, on the one hand, we're trying to do something to further increase like the market saturation, right? We want to reach a group of.

**Speaker D:** People who— Anapanasati, Okay, not necessarily. The first thing that we can say is that yes, Americans do respond to pay-as-you-go because we have been, let's say, indoctrinated into that. But the donation has been there in the American society as well as throughout history. An example of that would be medical doctors who are treating patients who can't pay the doctor. They don't have money, but they do give him a chicken and invite him to supper. Yeah, this kind of thing. All right, so, uh, and Christianity is based upon this. And one of the things that we I can't understand is that some of those Christians, televangelists mostly, are able to buy jets. So some of them, that money comes from someplace. Now, one of the things that we can think of it is, is that in fact I know this for sure, is that one of our sister organizations, the Open Dharma Foundation, has a whale. They've got money because someone has got real money who's willing to back the organization. I don't know who it is, but there are whales out there. There are people with money who, if they did a retreat, would pay the standard fee to retreat and that would be it. But these whales that have a huge amount of money that if they do a retreat and see how valuable it is, they might wind up giving $10,000 or $30,000. So this is the kind of thing that we can understand, that we do not know what the donations will be, but that if we can point the donations in two areas. First area would be supporting people who want to dedicate their lives to the Dharma, and they don't know how to do it otherwise. And the second group would be those same guys who are dedicating their lives to the Dharma, can then do free retreats, and we would support the retreats that they would give, by buying food for the wat, to do a retreat. A weekend retreat. So, these are the two areas that I can see that we have for the donations. Smaller donations would be like to create a community of already established teachers, whether they're established by charging money or establishing by going through donations. So those would be the 3 areas that we would have that actually touches old teachers, new teachers, and new students becoming teachers.

**Speaker F:** You know, I think— can I say one thing really quick?

**Speaker C:** Sure, go ahead.

**Speaker F:** Okay, one thing that we can think that we can offer too is like the collective resources of kind of all of us that have like field-tested where to go, which can be like just as valuable as the financial aspect that Dhammarato is bringing up. Because I know for me, I like when I was on my own practicing, I just didn't know where to go. And I've been to like a million different places. And I can tell people, hey, this is worth going to, this place is not worth going to, if they talk to me, but the resources aren't really there on the internet currently. And that's something that we can offer, I feel like, that we have a lot of people who are actually going to places, actually serious practitioners, and are like, hey, this is a place where you can go, you can stay for free, all you got to do is help out with lunch or whatever, and you can practice as long as you want. Because there's not a lot of cost in getting to places. I know of a lot of places where they're like, hey, if you just make it here, you know, you can stay as long as you want. I know of at least a few places like that near me, and obviously it's not that hard for most people to be able to come up with a little bit of money to get there, but it's really hard to know where these places are to begin with. So that was just something I would offer.

**Speaker B:** You're on mute, Dhammarato. Dhammarato, you're muted.

**Speaker D:** Yes, I was saying that we can put that kind of stuff in the email, in the website, as part of the description. Right now we're just trying to get a mission statement. It needs to be done, you know, like within a paragraph or so. One comment Even the details that I was making about where the money is going to go, that doesn't need to be in the mission statement.

**Speaker B:** Go ahead, Robert.

**Speaker C:** So one comment about the word dogma. I have two alternatives. One is exclusion, family rather than exclusion, and another alternative is family rather than indoctrination. And I like the word indoctrination a lot because it goes at the heart of creating a more open Buddhism that is open to input from many different traditions. However, I know exclusion is something that is a big topic on mind for many these days, particularly with respect to the inclusiveness, you know, a dialogue that's been going on within the United States. So those are two alternative ideas, and I'm curious to hear people's thoughts, because I kind of actually lean more towards indoctrination, because we don't want this to be about Thai Buddhism, right? We want it to be about open Sangha, not Thai Sangha, and also not being denigrating to other traditions in any way, shape, or form. I think railing against indoctrination is better than perhaps exclusion. It's more specific, but I'm curious to hear people's thoughts on that.

**Speaker D:** I would like to avoid words like that altogether. Indoctrination is a word that we could kind of avoid.

**Speaker C:** Perhaps exclusion would be better.

**Speaker D:** We can just take the rather than transactions out and create— okay, with Dhamma with how about gift giving creates family and leave the two rather than out.

**Speaker B:** That's not safe.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, let's take all of the rather than out and say what we are doing rather than what we're not doing. And maybe even— does that make sense, Parker, to take the reference?

**Speaker B:** I like that. I like that the way that sounds. It's maybe less scary or judgment statements that could be read as judgmental, even if we don't mean them. Other people who eventually join might read them as judgmental.

**Speaker C:** And perhaps we could even replace temples with Buddhist communities.

**Speaker D:** Got it, got it. That's it. That's exactly what we're building. Got it. Excellent, Robert. Excellent point.

**Speaker C:** Gracias.

**Speaker B:** All right, so here's sort of an updated, taking into consideration some of the additions. Open Sangha Foundation is a grassroots initiative of volunteers interested in improving access of traditional Sangha and Western Buddhism. We believe that true Sangha supports practice with dana, creates family, and encourages integration into Buddhist communities.

**Speaker D:** We got it. That sounds good for me.

**Speaker F:** That sounds really good, I think.

**Speaker C:** That sounds great.

**Speaker D:** Sure.

**Speaker E:** I think we should switch out Donna to be something that— because anybody who reads this or sees it on our website would have to like research it, or we'd have to explain it somewhere else. So like, if the mission statement is going to be seen by so many people, I think we should go with a word that, um, I got— I feel like I'm like kind of 50/50 on this because on the one hand.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, donations are gift-giving rather than dana because the Western community doesn't know the word dana even though it's in the word they use, donate, donator.

**Speaker E:** Okay, so you believe that?

**Speaker D:** True, Sangha. What about the word donations rather Yeah, or generosity, I think, is actually— I like generosity.

**Speaker B:** Me too.

**Speaker C:** Although generosity is kind of vague.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, that'll do. Generosity is a vague word. I like it. How generous of the postman to actually bring the mail.

**Speaker B:** Okay, Open Sangha Foundation is a grassroots initiative of volunteers interested in improving access to traditional Sangha and Western Buddhism. We believe that true Sangha supports generosity, creates family, and encourages integration into Buddhist communities. What do you guys think about the true Sangha? Do we need that, or do we leave the true out?

**Speaker E:** Well, I definitely think we should leave out true, but also I think that we should include more of an element of like, um, what we're really trying to— like, what we, what we believe that true Sangha— like, an element of what would make real Sangha. Let's maybe try the real Sangha. Real Sangha needs to be divorced from greed. So like essentially part of what we're trying to do with this corporation is we're trying to refine the nobility of the teachers, right? We're trying to handle money for them so they don't have to worry about it, so they can be 100% about nobility and the Dharma. So like part of what we believe or what we're trying to do is we want to facilitate financial stewardship for like, you know, the Buddhist monks who essentially would be better off by not having to deal with it at all. So I'd like some of those words.

**Speaker D:** Maybe put in there. Yeah, that's a good point. In fact, we might want to add a sentence about teacher training and support that we've stressed. You know, I don't know the word to use, but teacher training and support. Or teacher support?

**Speaker E:** I think refinement works really good. I've read a lot of work, and like, that's like an element of the traditional Buddhist teaching, this element of refinement, which is like kind of this process of like continuous improvement. We are like refining ourselves as conscious living beings. We're trying to be more— so we're trying to refine the quality of the education of the teachers or something.

**Speaker C:** I think also to expand upon someone's earlier point about expanding on some of the ideas in the mission statement, we could maybe have 3 sections, 3 different separate pages, one on generosity, one on family, and one on integration, right?

**Speaker D:** Right, that would be on the website, and we can talk about what's on the website. Right now we're doing mission statement.

**Speaker C:** Right, so if people wanted to click through and see what we mean by these things, they can do that. But for now, I'm going to keep it more general, right?

**Speaker D:** So we can just kind of point to that in the mission statement. We might even want to have clickbait, I think, you know, in the mission statement that's on the website where they can actually click, like teacher training or teacher support or things like that. Give them a direction. But right now we're trying to get the mission statement to put into the 501(c)(3).

**Speaker F:** What about builds family instead of creates family? What do people think of that? Or something— I don't know, just because create is like you do it once.

**Speaker D:** Promotes, I guess.

**Speaker E:** What about fosters?

**Speaker D:** I don't like foster care. That word has been ruined.

**Speaker E:** That would be good for— I want to throw in something about transparency because I feel like the— obviously being a nonprofit, but some element of transparency would be nice.

**Speaker D:** So like, okay, we can put— oh, I mean, got it in the name of the title, so we can make sure that we put open and transparent in one sentence somewhere.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, like part of our goal is to refine the quality of knowledge, right? We want to have an impact on positive knowledge spreading. We want to have like the right Dharma being spread. Another aspect of our mission statement would be like financial management, which is ideally it's going to try to impact the demon of greed in Western Sangha teaching or something, right? We want to try to reduce that to some degree if we can, if possible. And like, somehow transparency would be helpful in that area.

**Speaker D:** Well, we can put the word transparency in there. I would Actually could be part of the first line, in the sense of open Sangha Foundation is an open and transparent generosity-based nonprofit community building for the teachings of the Buddha, I guess we'd say.

**Speaker C:** Um, one question I have is with the word traditional, because that's a very loaded word for a lot of people.

**Speaker D:** Um, me too. I would like traditional taken out.

**Speaker G:** Okay?

**Speaker D:** Because there's, there's many kinds of tradition. An example of that is, are we going back all the way to the tradition of the Buddha himself? Are we going after the tradition that formed during the time of Asoka? Are we going after the teaching tradition of the 5th century. It seems that every time every 500 years ago Buddhism gets a brand new tradition.

**Speaker E:** Oh, what about this one? Improving access to Sangha, Kamma, both digital and physical, Kamma, in a new age of Western Buddhism.

**Speaker D:** Sounds great. I don't mind putting the word New Age in there, though it's got its own magical problems.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, yeah, I mean, like, it's kind of like 50/50. On the one hand, it is loaded. On the other hand, like, it is— that is part of what we're— so I mean, I'm using it more in a literal term, so hopefully people don't read into it too much with like the, uh, But no, that really is what we're doing. We're really trying to add the new age being digital, not Aquarius or whatever. That's why I mentioned earlier digital. So that's the new age. The real age is digital connectivity.

**Speaker C:** I'm opposed to new age because there are a lot of traditional Buddhist communities out there that would really not like that. Like say Tibetan or Zen. That's.

**Speaker D:** The point that I'm making.

**Speaker C:** Right, once they read that, they would say no thanks, we don't want to be part of any New Age.

**Speaker D:** Maybe not New Age. Another word that I'd like to take out, Parker, is the word 'we believe that True Sangha supports.' How about we can say 'we promote that?'.

**Speaker B:** How does this sound? I had a— I created a second one where it's just one line. Let me know if I'm leaving anything significant out. Open Sangha Foundation is a grassroots initiative of volunteers interested in improving access to Sangha and Western Buddhism. I guess it still doesn't flow. A Sangha and Western Buddhism that supports generosity, promotes family, and encourages integration into Buddhist communities. I interrupted myself there, but trying to make it flow into one rather than two sentences that include a "we believe.".

**Speaker D:** Okay, so it's looking good to me.

**Speaker A:** I thought of two places you could include the word transparent. You could say.

**Speaker B:** Like Corey said, I.

**Speaker D:** Think, transparent initiative, or that supports transparent.

**Speaker B:** Generosity, or that supports transparency and generosity.

**Speaker E:** I like transparent generosity because it's like, I don't really know what the difference is in all the different phrasing because I've actually learned that like the different phrasing of each one of those would mean some kind of subtly different thing. But I think that like that for me, kind of like, even though I don't really, I don't even know what the hell that really means. So maybe that would be a little bit of a red flag if other people are like transparent generosity. Well, I know what generosity is and And it's like, that's what rung the most true to me, is I would like to have transparent generosity. So I don't know, that's a weird— it seemed to like ring the most, but I was also kind of like, hmm.

**Speaker B:** How about talking about the initiative part? Because that has to do with more of the organization side, a grassroots transparent initiative.

**Speaker C:** Love it.

**Speaker D:** What we're doing right now is very generous, Dharma.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, yeah, you should do that one. That one sounds really good, I think.

**Speaker C:** Sweet. The one question is about the use of the word Sangha in the singular. So there are many Sanghas. There's hundreds, thousands, there's thousands of Sanghas. So do we want to say to Sangha as though it's a generic, like you think people will understand that Sangha means something kind of more generic about this collection of Sanghas? Or do we want to be more specific in saying improving access to a diverse array of Sanghas in Western Buddhism that support generosity, etc., etc., etc.?

**Speaker E:** I think that what I had done.

**Speaker D:** Earlier would cover it.

**Speaker G:** People are that word up, just like the word Sangha. So I propose that we use the word friendship or something else, anything else besides, or use this mission stays an opportunity to define that word Sangha with something else.

**Speaker D:** Yes, that's a good point. Yeah, let's make sure that we use the word Sangha and that we define it.

**Speaker B:** Do you guys like friendship or family better?

**Speaker C:** Um, what about.

**Speaker B:** Friendship?

**Speaker D:** Friendship, family, uh, community of generosity— those, uh, all three can be put in there.

**Speaker A:** What about, and encourages individual practitioners to.

**Speaker B:** Integrate into Buddhist communities at the very last line?

**Speaker E:** I don't think we do. We allow that too.

**Speaker D:** That's a good idea. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** I think that's sort of implied by encourages integration into Buddhist communities, but maybe not.

**Speaker E:** Well, you're right, we don't want to encourage it. We want to facilitate access for those who already want to do it. So like, we don't have a dog in the fight. Well, we kind of do, but like, really the goal is to like give more access to people so that they could do what they want to do rather than we tell them, even though.

**Speaker B:** We need integration and facilitation. I think those will be two big things that we do, right? Publicizing this like Joe was talking about, not to get into specifics, and then also maybe having grants or some sort of thing that encourage people to go.

**Speaker G:** One thing I want to point out really quickly here is I'm thinking a year ahead from now when I'm presenting OSC to maybe a group of my team members, and we already have established like in our company KPI, which is like a statistic that you track for improvement in a company. And so we have a wellness KPI, and so I'm thinking about, you know, that we're using the word Buddhist, we're using the word Buddhism. Is it possible that we could swap that out for something more generic, more corporatized, more like wellness?

**Speaker D:** I don't know, mental wellness or well-being. I like the word well-being.

**Speaker G:** Yeah. Instead of, uh, you know, a specific Buddhist, which could come off— it could come off as a religion.

**Speaker D:** But I don't even like the word Buddhism. I don't use it. There you go. Because there's a whole lot of people use the word for themselves, and we ain't like that.

**Speaker G:** Exactly.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker D:** Take the word Buddhism out. I'm okay with that too. One problem with that— ancient wisdom of the Buddha rather than the word Buddhism.

**Speaker B:** So right now it's being used in this way: Open Sangha Foundation is a grassroots transparent initiative of volunteers interested in improving access to Sangha in Western Buddhism that supports generosity, promotes friendship, and encourages integration into Buddhist communities. So we have those two points where we mention it: Western Buddhism and then integration to Buddhist communities.

**Speaker C:** Sure, I think one kind of needle.

**Speaker D:** To be thread here—.

**Speaker C:** Oh, sorry, go ahead, Kishon.

**Speaker G:** I was just going to say the first one, maybe mental well-being, you could replace it there in that context, possibly.

**Speaker C:** Sure, I mean, I think one you know, needle to be threaded here.

**Speaker D:** Let's use Buddhism, the word Buddhism, only one time at best.

**Speaker C:** Sure. And kind of one challenge that I see rising up here is there are so many communities that are very proudly Buddhist, right? Particularly the Asian wats, right? Like, I think if you were to go into a Thai wat, they may not say this is a mental well-being community. Right, although that might actually be what it is.

**Speaker D:** They would be speaking Thai language.

**Speaker G:** We know that.

**Speaker D:** I have no problem with any word you used.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, who's gonna write the checks is the real question. Is it the, you know, is it.

**Speaker D:** Them or is it— right, but kind.

**Speaker C:** Of the issue I'm pointing at right now is one thing I've seen in the States is there's kind of a division between the, you know, McMindfulness group, which is kind of people that are trying to— and that's a pejorative, of course— that are trying to take the Dhamma into corporations and say, oh, you can meditate so you can become a more productive worker so you can make us more money, right?

**Speaker D:** And then they got that.

**Speaker C:** Well, actually, that's the idea, right? And that's the controversy, because a lot of Buddhists are actually pushing back and saying, uh, no, this is This is the opposite of that. This is actually antithetical. Right, this is antithetical to the corporate values. This is actually the opposite of the corporate values. So I don't know if we want to.

**Speaker D:** Do a kind of a patient lead. We have to understand that the audience that we're trying to get to are the ones who don't know what we're talking about. So rather than saying that we have to tiptoe around those who know what they're talking about. Let's say we don't have to worry about tiptoeing around those guys, that we want to make sure that what we're saying is clear to the people who are not already holding positions.

**Speaker B:** So here's another one. I took out the Sangha and Western Buddhism and changed it Sangha in the West. Let me know what you guys think. Open Sangha Foundation is a grassroots transparent initiative of volunteers interested in improving access to Sangha in the West, supporting generosity, promoting friendship, and encouraging integration to Buddhist communities.

**Speaker C:** Sure, and you could maybe even replace Buddhist with mindfulness-based because that would be—.

**Speaker D:** I get a bonobo for that one. But we can— I would go for Buddhist and wellness-based. Community.

**Speaker C:** Great, I totally agree. Yeah, I think that way you get both. You get the more wealth wellness end of the spectrum, and you also get the Buddhist end of the spectrum.

**Speaker D:** And taking the word New Age out because that's got other things to it.

**Speaker B:** Are we including anything new when we say wellness-based, or is that just to give a different word for people who don't who might be put off by Buddhist communities?

**Speaker D:** I think that wellness-based is actually going in the direction of what we're actually doing.

**Speaker A:** Or what about mental health-based or something?

**Speaker D:** That's a big word now, isn't it?

**Speaker A:** Mental health.

**Speaker D:** That's a— wellness is an easier going. When we're talking about mental health, that gets into another danger area. Over a bunch of shrinks.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, I agree with you on that, Dhammarato. I like.

**Speaker B:** The way you— how does it— doesn't really flow right now, the last line of— and encouraging integration into Buddhist and wellness-based communities. Maybe it does. What are your guys' thoughts?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, that sounds good.

**Speaker C:** I like it. I'm gonna sign off for one second. I'll be right back on.

**Speaker B:** All right, okay, here I'll read it again. Open Sangha Foundation is a grassroots transparent initiative of volunteers interested in improving access to Sangha and Western Buddhism, supporting generosity, promoting friendship, and encouraging integration into Buddhist and wellness-based communities.

**Speaker F:** I just feel like wellness-based is so That's so vague though, because like, I mean, there are so many like weird hippie places out there that are doing crazy stuff.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, are we including Hinduism or that? It might, as this stuff grows, people might misinterpret that to be a wider category. I'm not sure. That's— I guess the issue has to deal with whether or not we want to put our foot down on the idea of Buddhism, with the negative part of that being people on the more mindfulness, Western science side of things might be put off by that, or if we want to try to include them at the expense of being more vague and wishy-washy.

**Speaker D:** I would think that we might want to look at words like, um, ancient wisdom of the Buddha and take the word Buddhism out.

**Speaker G:** I like that.

**Speaker B:** Communities that practice the ancient wisdom of the Buddha.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, and that could go for anybody. That could go for the Tibetans or whoever. They could say, oh yeah, that's us, these— they're talking about us.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, that's.

**Speaker F:** I mean, I think that's really good because I know even like very popular people like Samatha, like they often throw in something like that where they're like, oh, according to— or, you know, Eckhart Tolle likes to like name-drop the Buddha.

**Speaker B:** All right, Open Sangha Foundation is a grassroots transparent initiative of volunteers interested in improving access to Sangha in Western Buddhism, supporting generosity, promoting friendship, and encouraging integration into communities that practice the ancient wisdom of the Buddha.

**Speaker F:** There's just still that issue of like Sangha not being defined, because we all know what it is, but like, yeah, I mean, Kishon has a point about that, but people are gonna read that and they're gonna be like, what the world is that? Just the second, like the second use of Sangha.

**Speaker D:** If we use the word Sangha, then we can put in parentheses after that noble friendship, and that should be enough to define what the word Sangha means. I think that works.

**Speaker G:** Or you could just go with noble friendship without the word Sangha. I mean, the Sangha is in the whole name of the organization.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I guess it's in the Open Sangha Foundation, and it might Yeah, it's.

**Speaker D:** Got Open Sangha Foundation, the name of it. So we can put, uh, we could actually define the term Sangha as noble friendship without having— I mean, whether we put the word in or not is not important.

**Speaker G:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Open Sangha Foundation is a grassroots transparent initiative of volunteers interested in improving the access to noble friendship in West— in the West. Supporting generosity, promoting friendship, and encouraging integration into communities that practice the ancient wisdom of the Buddha.

**Speaker G:** I like that, except I think we repeated the word friendship, but it sounds good.

**Speaker B:** Yep, we do noble friendship and then promoting friendship.

**Speaker E:** I think we should say worldwide instead of in the West.

**Speaker G:** We can delete the words Actually, at.

**Speaker D:** The end of it we can put worldwide. I like the idea in the West, uh, at the first time that we use it, but we can add worldwide somewhere later in there.

**Speaker E:** Sure.

**Speaker D:** Globally.

**Speaker E:** Globally. We're going global. Here's a mission statement that I Googled, a different one. I don't know if you guys want to hear the other mission statement. So we can get an idea of what they're like. But honestly, they are kind of similar to ours. I think ours could use like a little bit more direction, but then at the same time, I don't know, it is kind of like okay as it is. I think we're getting pretty close to something, but we could also use like maybe one more line too. Like other— I looked at a couple other mission statements. I've seen some of them get kind of lengthy. So if we wanted to add another line, or to separate the one into two. I think that would kind of like work as well to add a little bit more conciseness to it. That way we, um, rather than like oversimplify and have it so completely concise that we kind of don't mention some of the important things that we'd like to do.

**Speaker D:** Can you put that into a sentence that we can add to the one part that we we already have there for that Parker's got?

**Speaker E:** Well, the thing is that so we have everything there summarized into like one sentence. We could split it into two that is more defined. So rather than adding anything else, I think we could split that into two, or we could continue on our current path to just keep it as like one short, concise Is that one sentence or two sentences? Yeah, I think it's just one sentence. So we could either keep doing that one or like we could add a second one or work this one into two.

**Speaker B:** That's a good point. Thanks for checking out other mission statements, Corey.

**Speaker E:** I wish I had more time to check them out before, but I've been like super busy.

**Speaker B:** We're not going to be voting on it now since people have dropped off.

**Speaker F:** So.

**Speaker B:** If you guys think we can leave it here, or if we can keep refining, we can leave it here for now, and then we can have it in the chat for us to keep refining.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, that'd work. I mean, like, if anyone wants to try their hand at it and adding more, then that could be like another project for anyone on the board, you know, like try and make your own, or to try and add to it if you can, and then next time we meet, hopefully we'll have something definitive to vote on, I guess.

**Speaker D:** Yes. Okay, so let's go ahead and vote on this one as the official one, knowing that it can be changed at a later time, that this is not set in concrete, but at least is agreeable with us.

**Speaker B:** Do we have anything to say about friendship repeating twice?

**Speaker F:** I think that's fine.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you could use the word family somewhere in case of one of those.

**Speaker B:** Friendship, to friendship repeating.

**Speaker A:** You could use family somehow.

**Speaker C:** I don't know, you could work on it.

**Speaker B:** Promoting— I'm going to read it twice. You guys let me know what you think. Open Sangha Foundation is a grassroots and transparent initiative of volunteers interested in improving access to noble friendship in the West. Supporting generosity, promoting friendship, and encouraging integration to communities that practice the ancient wisdom of the Buddha. Okay, second time. Open Sangha Foundation is a grassroots and transparent initiative of volunteers interested in improving access to noble friendship in the West, supporting generosity, promoting family, and encouraging integration to communities that practice the ancient wisdom of the Buddha.

**Speaker D:** I like the second one.

**Speaker E:** I think that works. Yeah, it works good. Enough for now. So I think that that's fine.

**Speaker D:** Yes, it works. I also know that the website can be changed later. That's our thing. But this mission statement has to go in the 501(c)(3), and I think that we've got it well enough there to define what we're doing.

**Speaker B:** So let's have this one. We don't have to vote on the proposal officially. But we can agree upon the fact that we can put this one in the 501(c)(3) because those are just government papers and those won't be public facing.

**Speaker D:** Right.

**Speaker B:** OK, do you guys agree on this for the government papers?

**Speaker G:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** All in favor, yeah.

**Speaker D:** Yeah. I think we should.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** We should switch to saying nays because like, I think everyone's probably going to always agree when we press these things. So like. If we just say, who is there? Anyone who says nay, it'll be really obvious. And then that would be easier to do.

**Speaker G:** Or forever hold your silence.

**Speaker A:** There you go.

**Speaker B:** Love it. All right, great. Well, that's all I have. That's all we have.

**Speaker D:** Thank you, Parker. I am impressed with you guys. In general, and most specifically Parker and a few of the others. Thank you guys so much. I really appreciate it.

**Speaker G:** Excellent work, Parker.

**Speaker D:** I couldn't do it without you. I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't bother doing it.

**Speaker B:** Yes, and Tyler's not here, but he's been doing a lot of great work. Without this formal proposal system, things— I think some formality has been very beneficial in having concrete structure that we can build upon. So thank you. To him for that if he ever hears this. Great, so that's all. I'll leave the proposal for the mission statement in the chat, and if anyone wants to make suggestions, the proposal isn't officially approved yet. So cool, great, great talking to you guys. Thank you so much for coming and for volunteering, for being on the board. It's really wonderful to see this coming together.

**Speaker D:** Yes, thank you, thank each one of you. Thank you, Robert. And thank you, Joe and Tyler and, uh, Keyshawn. Thank you. And all— Corey, it says plus 4, so I'm not sure all the names.

**Speaker E:** No worries.

**Speaker B:** All right, see you guys.

**Speaker E:** Good one, everybody.

**Speaker D:** Thank you, everybody.

**Speaker C:** Have a great one. Cheers.


### Summary

This is a summary of the meeting transcript:

**Meeting Purpose:** To formalize the structure of the Open Sangha Foundation (OSF) by voting on key proposals.

**Key Decisions & Outcomes:**

1.  **Proposal 2 - Initial Board Members: PASSED**
    *   The group formally approved the initial slate of board members (all 9 attendees).
    *   This board will now be responsible for reviewing and voting on future organizational proposals.

2.  **Proposal 3 - Establish 501(c)(3) Nonprofit Status: PASSED**
    *   The board approved a plan and budget (~$480) to formally incorporate as a nonprofit.
    *   The process involves hiring a contractor from Fiverr to prepare state incorporation and IRS paperwork (Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws).
    *   The goal is to obtain tax-exempt status to receive donations without tax liability for donors.

3.  **Proposal 4 - Mission Statement: DISCUSSED (Not Finalized)**
    *   A draft mission statement was reviewed and extensively debated.
    *   **Core Debate Points:**
        *   **Tone:** Should it state what OSF *is for* (positive) or what it's *against* (e.g., "transactions," "dogma")?
        *   **Language:** Use accessible English ("generosity," "friendship") vs. Pali/Sanskrit terms ("dana," "Sangha").
        *   **Scope:** Should it specify "Western Buddhism," "wellness," or "the ancient wisdom of the Buddha"?
        *   **Audience:** Balancing appeal to newcomers with respect for traditional Buddhist communities.
    *   **Working Version (For IRS Paperwork):** The group agreed on a temporary version to submit with the 501(c)(3) application, acknowledging it can be refined later:
        > *"Open Sangha Foundation is a grassroots and transparent initiative of volunteers interested in improving access to noble friendship in the West, supporting generosity, promoting family, and encouraging integration to communities that practice the ancient wisdom of the Buddha."*

**Next Steps:**
*   Parker will proceed with the 501(c)(3) filing process using the approved funds.
*   The board will need to define roles (Director, Treasurer, etc.) and meeting schedules in a future proposal.
*   The mission statement will remain open for further refinement by the board before being finalized for public use.

**Overall Tone:** The meeting was collaborative and productive. Participants were enthusiastic about formalizing the organization to support a decentralized, generosity-based Buddhist community focused on accessibility and integration.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use a few key metaphors and stories to explain their ideas and organizational vision:

**Metaphors:**

1.  **"Guiding Light"** (for the mission statement): Speaker A (Tyler) explicitly uses this metaphor to describe the purpose of the mission statement: *"this is really meant to be kind of a guiding light so that when we... are having discussions about what we prioritize... we can reference that mission statement."*

2.  **"Facebook for Dhamma" / "Digital Connectivity"**: Speaker E (Corey) uses this modern analogy to describe their goal of building community: *"we're basically trying to make like Facebook for Dhamma... We're trying to add social media, connect the connectivity that social media has."* This is part of a larger metaphor of updating tradition for a "new age," which they clarify means the digital age, not the spiritual movement.

3.  **"Cooking with Grease"**: Speaker E uses this colloquial phrase to indicate productive progress during the mission statement discussion: *"I think we're cooking with grease now."*

4.  **"Needle to be Threaded"**: Speaker C (Robert) uses this common metaphor to describe a delicate balancing act in their wording, specifically between appealing to traditional Buddhist communities and using more modern, corporate-friendly language like "wellness."

**Stories / Analogies:**

1.  **The Medical Doctor and the Chicken**: Speaker D (Dhammarato) tells a brief story to illustrate that the donation (*dana*) model is not foreign to Western culture: *"An example of that would be medical doctors who are treating patients who can't pay... they do give him a chicken and invite him to supper."*

2.  **The "Whale" Donor**: Speaker D uses the business/fundraising term "whale" (a major donor) as a conceptual story to explain a potential financial future: *"the Open Dharma Foundation, has a whale. They've got money because someone has got real money who's willing to back the organization... they might wind up giving $10,000 or $30,000."* This story outlines a vision for how large donations could support teachers and free retreats.

3.  **The Lone Ranger in the Dharma / The Cave**: Speakers refer to the common story of the solitary practitioner. Speaker C mentions changing the dynamic *"from being oriented towards the solo practitioner,"* and Speaker E adds, *"it's just part of the traditional mystical journey. You have to go into a cave... for a while."* Their mission is presented as an alternative to this "lone ranger" narrative.

4.  **The First-Grade Alphabet Analogy**: Speaker D uses this analogy to argue against excluding those who currently use a transactional (fee-based) model: *"can you imagine that students can't get into the first grade until they already know their alphabet? Makes no sense... In that regard, I don't think that we should limit it."* The story advocates for inclusivity and education over purity.

These metaphors and stories help the group conceptualize their new organization's structure (guiding light, cooking with grease), its role in the modern world (Facebook for Dhamma, digital connectivity), its financial philosophy (the doctor, the whale), and its desired community impact (moving beyond the lone ranger in the cave).
