### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, welcome everyone to Wednesday Sangha UK. So we're chilling, we're vibing. Scott is currently out. So yeah, but we were kind of talking a little bit about like physical activity and how that can also be really helpful for alleviating Dukkha, kind of getting out of hindrances as well, waking up. So yeah, if anyone would like to talk a little bit more on that or share— I actually myself, I enjoy practicing a little bit of like sun salutations, like the hatha yoga, the stretches. So that's kind of nice. And then also doing walking meditation and just going for walks in general is another fun way.

**Speaker B:** Like that, or how does it— yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Sun salutations are— they're like 12 sort of steps, but yeah, like kind of like starts out and then you go down to the floor and kind of come back up. There's a couple of different poses in it, so it's kind of nice. I like it because you can loop them, so you can kind of just like loop them around, so you can do like 10 or, you know, until you kind of burn out. But it's nice because it's like a full body workout and you can again practice the breathing with that as well. So I enjoy like practicing some of that sometimes in the morning and then do like like 10-minute like sit or however long. Sometimes just however long I feel if it's good, right? So that can be quite nice. So really get the energy going and then just chill out.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, this is a crazy position right here.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, like.

**Speaker B:** I, I'm, uh, I can't be a victim here, right? Like if I'm a victim here, I'm gonna get slaughtered. But if I'm all open, like like, come, come get me, I'm the king of the castle right now. So I start the morning like that, it's amazing.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, just straight up, just willing to take it all in.

**Speaker B:** Yep. Someone saw me doing that actually to work today. They pointed it out, they saw it, they're like, that looks like a good stretch. And I smiled at them like, you know it, it is.

**Speaker A:** I know, that's nice. It's interesting. Yeah, that makes me think of like that whole victory pose when, um, you know, Dhammarato is like showcasing like Piti, right? And he goes like this, right? Um, can't quite see the whole thing, but you know, like hands up in the air, like let's go, you know? And that is just— that really stuck in, in terms of that and like that feeling of success and that feeling of being a champion to kind of point towards that. So I think that's really wonderful.

**Speaker C:** Yeah. And it's funny how it's like also tied to the body too, because it feels very awake and like alert, just like your muscles are just like, I'm here. So it feels really refreshing. And it's funny, the body, this thing like that, how it's connected to feelings.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, no, it's helpful to kind of like understand that connection a bit and to play with it. I know last time when I was kind of on and starting the call, we talked a bit about like smiling as well. So that's like another thing that's kind of nice to be aware of with the body and how that can connect with, you know, actually gladdening the mind, doing something physical. And of course, the breath as well, just being aware of of the breath and actually like taking an effort to make it long and like enjoyable, that can like completely change one's mood, you know, which is nice. Yeah, that is like one of the elements that I think is like sometimes, you know, at least that I found coming to this practice, is that that difference between like actually putting in the effort and directing the breath as opposed to just like passively watching it and like, okay, we're going to, you know, take the nice long breaths. We're gonna put a little skin in the game, um, and that kind of brings it back together with like, okay, you know, we know what we're doing here. We are aware. So that's wonderful with actually having more of a concrete, if you will, or a direct understanding of even what mindfulness is or Sati is in terms of like waking up. And it's a little less like, you know, doubtful or whatever. It's just like, hey, no, we know what this is. You know, and it's this right now, just being aware of this in-breath.

**Speaker B:** And.

**Speaker A:** Being aware of the out-breath and putting in that effort to make it long. So yeah, I know. And with that too, like actually physically relaxing the body as well. That's also quite nice with the tensions and just like actually like, oh, we can just relax. The shoulder or any tensions in the forehead, that is quite, you know, enjoyable and enjoying that process. But yeah, just putting in that little bit of effort, I have found it has made practice feel a little bit more consistently enjoyable as well as, yeah, no, it's just there's a little bit of benefits, just like a little bit of effort.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, however much it takes to gladden the mind, right? But yeah.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, just— yeah, go ahead, you first. Okay, no, so yeah, it's like Anapanasati is something you do, and it's like, uh, you know, the Buddha talks about skillful, unskillful actions, so attending to the body is kind of skillful. And when you're able to look at it and abide in it in like a not ordinary way where you only pay attention to it if it hurts or if you have a pain or an ache, or if there's something like extremely pleasurable happening to it, that's when you pay attention. It's— you're kind of like shifting the whole way you abide in the body. And it's it into a more skillful manner. Like, oh, I'm in my body because it feels nice right now and it's wholesome right now, it feels good right now. And then just again, like rinsing and repeating and watching and looking and changing and investigating over and over and over again. Yeah, that's only something you could do. So it is wholesome and it's enjoyable for sure.

**Speaker B:** And we'll probably be in pain if we're not doing that. That's why the pain will be there. We're doing something else, focusing on some problem, and then the back starts hurting. You're like, oh shit, why is it hurting again?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, my posture is bad or something, and then adjusting.

**Speaker B:** Posture is usually like kind of sign of the mind, I think. Same thing we were talking about earlier with the open posture. Yeah, they're like directly connected.

**Speaker C:** Versus like all like fetal, scrunched in, tight, in defense mode. Yeah. Or also like I was thinking like a kind of like a funny funny toy to like in relation with the body, you know, there's actions that are kind of unskillful to the body. Like, yeah, maybe Taco Bell at midnight is not the best option. You know, that's Dukkha. This is a Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** That is Dukkha. It's Dukkha in the morning too.

**Speaker C:** Dukkha in the morning. Yeah. So like catching it ahead of time too.

**Speaker B:** Meal prep.

**Speaker C:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker B:** I was going to say earlier with the long breaths, I noticed that there's— Dhammarato was also talking about the short breaths, right? The— and you would always get the everyone to join along. I noticed those breaths are really useful when I have a brother and he's going through some life changes now. So he's often just like, like a wet sock or something, just kind of moping about. And I'm like, bro, do your breaths right now. And then he just starts doing it. His eyes wake up. He's just breathing. And then all of a sudden, we're just laughing. And like we're friends again. It's all good. Problems are gone.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** I was just gonna say, like, when you're in a high anxiety, like there's so many thoughts swirling, that's when the long breaths come in. And then when you're like, just there's nothing in you, you're just the cold rock, that's when those big breaths just penetrate right into, like, open the whole body up again, start up that motor, push the car out of the mud. Momentum builds up.

**Speaker A:** And no, it's cool though, you bring up the short breaths too. Yeah, because those can be quite useful. They're fun for like building up energy and what have you. It's kind of nice, like, yeah, if we're feeling a little sloppy, we're feeling a little lethargic, then going with the short breaths and really waking up is quite helpful. And also, yeah, building like some of that Piti. That's what I like to practice with normally. Like if I do do like a sit or what have you, again, it doesn't have to be super formulaic, but I like playing around. And so a lot of the time around the start, like, you know, I'll first like get relaxed and all that stuff, but then I'll actually move fairly early on to like just a round of short breaths for however long it feels comfortable. Then drop that and go into the long breaths and then just like really chill out. So that's kind of nice, the interplay. It's like actually ramping up, like, yes, we can do this, you know, that whole winner attitude, and then moving it down and just like just chillaxing. So that can be helpful with that. Yeah. And just like any time you have, we're like, I find sometimes with the long breaths too, like if you're consistently doing it again, some alteration can be nice because it can get a little like if you're doing it like like an hour or something if you're like really on it and practicing like throughout the day. It's like, oh, okay. So switching it up, even if it's for a little bit, can also be kind of nice. But yeah, definitely, if we're like feeling lethargic, that's a nice way to play around as well.

**Speaker C:** Yeah. Another like fun, fun thing to play around with that I've been doing recently.

**Speaker A:** Is.

**Speaker C:** I don't know if you guys are familiar, but Bhikkhu Thanissaro, he mentions playing with the breath and visualizing it kind of like energy flowing through the body and putting it to different muscles.

**Speaker B:** Like.

**Speaker C:** The four parts of the abdomen moving into the back. How does it feel like if you imagine the breath coming through the back of the skull, or if you're breathing through your pores or breathing through your eyes? And then it makes the long breath a lot more interesting. And to play around with because I need my little toys still.

**Speaker B:** But yeah, yeah, that's wild. That's crazy. I do something similar to that, kind of like in the gym, but that's kind of— that's my workshop where I play with all these things. That's really awesome. And yeah, I'll try it out a bit more attentively now that you Dhammarato described it like that.

**Speaker C:** Now it's so cool. Yeah, just like, like, what does it feel like if you breathe from the back? Because, you know, like, again, breathing is kind of— if you leave it conceptual, it's tied to like, oh, the nose, the diaphragm. So if you kind of met— well, like, what does it feel if I breathe through the sole of my feet, like, as a toy to play with? And knowing that it's a toy, and it makes it much more engaging and fun. So yeah, I recommend it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, no, that's cool. Bring that up, Isaiah. I was actually just talking to somebody who did a Dhammarato retreat recently on the Discord server, and they were mentioning like that as well. Yeah, like the actual breathing into the different parts of the body or breathing from it, right? And kind of feeling that energy. But yeah, no, that's cool too, because it really— I mean, it goes into the being aware of the body as well, right? So it's not like, okay, we have to be hyper laser focused on just like one area, but rather we can become aware and breathe in or from the whole body. So that's nice too, because it's like, yeah, there's all these different toys to play with and things to investigate when it comes to the sensations of the body and what makes that up as well as we're breathing in and out.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker C:** And it's cool too, because like even At first when I encountered and messed around with it, I didn't realize, but it also now it's kind of more sobering because it's like, oh yeah, I'm kind of fabricating that experience of breathing through the feet, right? And just as I could fabricate breathing through the feet, I could fabricate Dukkha, I could fabricate Piti, I could fabricate Sukkha as a part of my experience. And it's fun to start messing around with being fabrications kind of wholesomely. And then it changes again, like, like slowly but surely by repeating it, it changes. And I don't know, it just feels good.

**Speaker B:** I think you hit it right on the head. I think that's the main point that that's trying to show. Perfect. It's all mind.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's the forerunner for sure.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's interesting seeing how so much of it is like from direct experience, like, you know, fabricated. And even like you mentioned there, like even when it's from the diaphragm or from the nose tip or it's being located in one particular area, that's sort of also a fabrication. Like, where is the breath, right? So that's a fun thing to play around with for sure. Yeah. And it's all equally real.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, because I mean, we don't think about it, but the skin like gets diffusion of oxygen too. So it's like, but we never consider that in the direct subjective experience that, you know, just through like diffusion, we're getting oxygen through the skin. So it's, yeah, it's just, it's kind of wild. And then it really kind of makes you question feelings, you know, like, like, I don't know, before I encountered the practice, they were this big thing, or like this kind of like mysterious Pandora's box, you know, they come, sometimes they're good, sometimes they're bad. And when they're bad, they're kind of scary. But now that like, it feels very liberating to have control, I can feel good when I want. So now, even the bad feelings aren't that hard to look at. And then to have fun and investigate the second noble truth. Like, oh well, what is this? You know, what's causing this? Like a little, like a detective.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, really playing with that investigation. And it's interesting too, like, because it's like breaking things down until they're like constituent parts, and it's not like this big piling on. It's just like, oh, okay, there's just a little bit of like disliking. Like, especially when we pull back and we really see like the feelings of the liking, disliking, not knowing, and those reactions. And it's like, it's interesting because it's just like, you just see it and it's so impersonal or what have you. It's just sort of like, okay, that's sort of happening. But then we can direct it to like more, okay, like the more pleasant, you know, feelings. But even that is like, you know, it's like, oh, I like it, but I don't want it, right? So the pleasant feelings come or whatever through the meditation, but we're not like attaching to those or some conceptual idea of it either. It's just like, okay, that's cool, that comes up, that's pleasant, and then it goes away. Okay, cool, but we'll find something else and some other way to gladden or whatever. So it's not even so fixated on any particular configuration of sensations. It's just like, oh, okay, that's cool too.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's like having it on tap. It's like you don't— nobody goes around like with their mouth in their faucet Like just trying to like, oh, because it's there. Like you could get water whenever you want. You don't have to like put your mouth in there and just have pressing the button like 24/7. It's like, ah, there's water when I'm thirsty, I'll go drink from it. And it feels much more wholesome because it's inside, not because outside people do that with external objects that they think brings them joy and good feelings. But when it's on inside, it's just like having tap water. Just go get my Lofill right now, drink.

**Speaker A:** Well, yeah, precisely. It's much more reliable than, yeah, like external sort of pleasures. So, and that's why I like the wholesome states of mind, just so wonderful, because it's just like, okay, yeah, this is quite easily available. And yeah, especially too when we play around, we do the investigation, and we look into you know, the nature of reality as it is, it's like, oh, okay, cool, we actually can kind of choose, you know, when the mind is sharp, like how we can feel, right? So we can feel that joy, we can bring that up, we can bring up satisfaction and ease, you know. But that's the cool thing too, is we're also riding the wave of these emotions and not being like, again, it's like, oh, okay, cool, it's like party time, and we feel the Piti and we feel the success and this overflow. It's like, oh wow, that's so wonderful. But then also too, can we ride it when it goes like nice and chill and calm and easy and all that as well, or a mixture. And so it doesn't have to be one thing, because like I think what happens sometimes is people get maybe attached to one particular kind of flavor of happiness. But if we can enjoy all the different flavors of happiness, whether that be like wahoo, or that kind of like when it dies down and it's just chill and calm and serene, you know, that's the wonder And that's it. Like, it's just so, so enjoyable and it's very easily available. Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Yeah. You get to enjoy the show rather than getting sad because the scene ended.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Precisely. And yeah, no, so it is wonderful and it's nice to just be able to be like, okay, yeah, you know what, we can just be, we can be happy camper just sitting there. Up and breathing or walking or whatever, you know. So it's so nice. And yeah, no, that's making me think too, yeah, about the activity and also like practicing, um, you know, walking meditation, you know, either like a little bit more formalized where one might be walking a little slower. Like I've got room here where I will practice the walking meditation. So it's nice to mix it up and not have to be like we have to necessarily do a strong determination or what have you, but we can mix it up. So we can be kind of— well, we can be kind to the body. I spent a fair bit of time like meditating with a little bit more of the strong determination. We're going to work through it. We're going to be completely still or what have you. And like, sure, that I investigated into the nature of pain or whatever. It's like sensations, but it's like, okay, we can kind of see that. And that's cool. But also we don't have to like necessarily get into this thing where it's like a marathon, right? So we can enjoy the practice and, you know, maybe move around a little bit. That can be nice. Like, I mean, even if you're sitting, right, and we were talking about posture before, right, it's actually like, okay, like making those minor adjustments, like, and really watching where like one's weight is resting with the spine or what have you, not necessarily always getting into like this super tensed position, but actually just like, okay, we might get like exaggerated, right? We might do that and then kind of relax it down a bit, find that thing. And then if it's like, okay, we find ourselves getting into a little bit of a lethargic thing, we can kind of pick it back up, right? But there can be a movement, especially when we're doing these longer breaths. There is a movement. You can actually breathe into that. Like, even if I notice perhaps a little bit of a minor discomfort, again, breathing into that or what have you, you notice that with just that movement, it kind of subsides even. So yeah, that's kind of a nice thing too. But it doesn't have to be the static sort of tense thing. It can be like, okay, we are really relaxing that. And then again, if we feel like going a little bit more and get up and walk around, or just practice with that way as well as an alternative with the walking meditation, or getting outside and walking in daylight or what have you, is also really another wonderful way to practice. And what's wonderful about the walking too is that it kind of helps with the integration, I think, into like, you know, everyday life and like going out. And so when we're not into seclusion and actually like continuing the practice off the cushion, if you will. So that's a nice way as well. Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I like how you said that this is not supposed to be static and like determination, because that's kind of like I think about it, it reminded me that's kind of like an ordinary way of like living, that that's how most people kind of live. They just kind of like muscle through it. They're like, I was told that I had to do this job in this way and I had to struggle and not be happy all the way. I will drag my feet even if I fall on my way out. And it's kind of like Yeah, it's funny because that's how, like, that attitude of being static— because that's not the way things are. Everything's moving, everything's changing, everything's flowing. Nothing is staying the same. It's like— so just that little, like, view change changes your attitude because then it's much more easy to go with the right flow, not the wrong flow.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, precise.

**Speaker B:** Sea legs.

**Speaker A:** Sea legs. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** It was good to have your sea legs. And when you're going, like you're saying, DJ, from the different kinds of happiness, it's the change that is irritating to the unwise, right? The change of going from one to the other. And then you try and be static with it. This is okay. Anapanasati. Yeah. I was safe last time.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, no, this is okay too, you know. And then we can find something to either enjoy about it or have it just be as it is, you know, and just enjoy that. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** This reminds me a lot of— I do these kind of determination sits in the sauna. You guys ever tried that? Okay, quite something. It's like you're getting this extreme heat and like everything in your body is telling you to get out and there's so much pain and like it just hurts to breathe. Breathing's supposed to be fun, now breathing is painful. And I realize that it's actually the way that I am sitting or the way that I'm in the mind, right, that I'm creating this pain. And all of a sudden I'm like, I've done this before, I know that I can be in this hot room and actually enjoy it. It flips, the pain is gone, there's actually no pain. I'm not exaggerating it, there's zero, like 0.00 pain, and I'm just enjoying it. And my body feels like it's reaching out into the heated room I'm just like breathing, and then the pain comes back. Now I'll settle it back down, and then I'll try and like, okay, let me try and get 10 good breaths where I enjoy every kind of in and out of it. And I get like 7 breaths, I'm like, okay, nope, try again. And I won't leave the sauna until I can get 10 like breaths where I'm actually enjoying it. And it's not like, okay, I'm done the 10, let me get up. I'm like, I feel perfectly good. I could stay in here longer, but you know what? Let's just get up and leave. Yeah, it's not like I'm leaving out of pain. I make sure that I'm in a state where there's no pain and I'm practicing that. And then I get out and usually these like insights just start popping into my head right after. That's my kind of sauna journeys.

**Speaker A:** No, that's cool. Or hot because it's a sauna. But, you know, there's— it is like very interesting to see that, like how that can change with, you know, unpleasant sensations. Like, yeah, like either with our change of reference with our mind, slight movements, but also like, yeah, like it will like— I mean, that ain't permanent either. And it is sensations. So I noticed that when I was doing sometimes the longer sits or I mean, sometimes if I do still sit a little bit longer. I mean, I'll notice that too, like it'll come and then it'll go away and it's like, okay, not that big of a deal. So it is interesting to see that for sure, right? I think it's just helpful. Again, it's kind of to play around and have fun with it. I think the main thing is what we can kind of get into with like more strong determination, like sittings or what have you, that might be the thing is like this kind of comparison or like that whole static thing where it's like, well, we need to go for this long before we get the cookie or whatever it is, whatever the goodie is, right? Rather than being like, hey, we can enjoy this from the beginning to, you know, like from the very start, in the beginning, middle, and end. And so that could be really, you know, wonderful rather than, oh, well, I have to sit here for like 40+ minutes before the special thing happens, you know, or like, oh man, I only sat for like, you know, 5 minutes today and yesterday I sat for like 40. Also too, I think like breaking it up so it's more frequently throughout the day if you are practicing like seclusion sessions is also quite lovely. So welcome, Panna. Yeah, like so you have more of those hits because I think that's what Dhammarato tends to recommend is like actually to practice like more frequently but a little shorter. So it's like you have also a little bit more high quality when you do practice. But also it's spread out a little bit more throughout the day, as opposed to like, okay, we practice for like 1 hour straight and then kind of like just drop off, you know, for the rest of the day. This is like, oh, okay, we practice like a little bit in the morning, a little bit, you know, throughout the day. And then that helps it to trigger Sati more throughout the day. So we remember and we're like, oh, okay, cool. And then, you know, gladden the mind and what have you. When we're not practicing formally, when we're just, you know, up and about. And so that kind of, I think, is another fun way to practice. But honestly too, I think if you're like sitting there and you're enjoying yourself, you know, go at it. Or if you feel like investigating— yeah.

**Speaker B:** I want to say that's actually a really good point. That wraps up what I was trying to say really nicely, because I don't go in there all the time. I go in there like once a week and I don't have a timer. I'm literally— sometimes I'll stay in there much longer, sometimes not. I make sure that me having fun is like why I'm in there. Yeah, yeah. I don't try to torture myself with that. It's kind of— and the cookie is if I'm doing the practice right. So it's kind of a weird— I don't know what that is, loophole or a weird way to approach it. But yeah, I agree. Don't torture yourself.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, no austerities here.

**Speaker A:** No, no, no. But again, it can be fun, right? Like what you're saying, like to play around, to experiment, and to see that, like you're putting yourself in that situation. But again, it's still like, okay, it's still safe, right? I mean, this can be a fun thing too, like if we're into like about the temperature thing, like taking like cold showers or what have you, that can be another wonderful way to wake up, or what have you. But like, okay, it's like sort of like safe, but also like you know, kind of experimenting with that and playing with it and being like, hey, it's not that bad, you know.

**Speaker B:** So yeah, is that why the Buddha went to like the spooky swamps?

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker B:** Dharma was like, that's advanced practice to go into the spooky swamps. So we don't need to always go to the spooky swamps. No, even when I'm training weights, I warm up with lightweight all the time. I probably use more lightweights than heavyweights. Way more. Just use the heavyweights just a little bit for fun. Try it out.

**Speaker C:** And it is different too, because when you're like, when you're approaching it like that, it's not like I fail for not being able to lift a heavyweight or I fail because I can't be 2 hours in the sauna or something crazy like that. It's like I want to see how far this skill goes. So then it's like, oh, and then when it ends, it's like, that's it. Okay, let's try again some other time. And then just enjoying that whole process of discovery is nice and wholesome. And it's different than like doing endurance just to see how long you could withstand torture.

**Speaker B:** And when you leave the sauna in a good mood, you don't actually lose.

**Speaker C:** No, it feels really relaxing. It's like, ah, the muscles. I always like how the muscles feel.

**Speaker B:** But instead of like leaving, instead of leaving when you don't want to leave, when you're like, oh, I'm uncomfortable, I'm gonna get out, I'm saying like I'm leaving, uh, when I want to get out. So I'm never even leaving like a loser. I'm never like, oh, the The sauna beat me today. It's like, no, all right, I'm good. Time to get cold now. That was fun.

**Speaker C:** I like the sauna too. It's fun.

**Speaker A:** I like that approach.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I'm sorry.

**Speaker A:** Oh, no problem.

**Speaker B:** Go back to sauna. I was wondering where you guys live. I know DJ, you're in You're in Canada with me, right?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I'm in Arizona, so I like when it's just hot as shit outside. I like the heat, period. But I also like the cold, so there's no part of the year I don't like.

**Speaker B:** There you go. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Nice.

**Speaker C:** But yeah, I see people, they're always either happy that it's winter or like just so distressed that it's summer and it's so hot. But I'm like, people voluntarily choose to go in saunas. We're getting this 120-degree weather for free, baby. Let's enjoy it. Just like people go take ice bath. I'm like, oh, it's cold outside. That's shit. I don't have to pay for ice. I don't have to turn on the water. It is cold. But yeah, but that part has grown because of the practice. I wasn't like that before. So, but I like it because now life is much more easy, not complicated, very simple.

**Speaker B:** Simple.

**Speaker C:** And yeah, but it like, because that's kind of like you were saying, DJ, like the flavors of happiness. There's so many things changing on the outside. To like the summer more than the winter is almost silly. That's setting yourself up to fail.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** No, precisely. And so we just like see that and we recognize it. It's like, oh wow, yeah, no, that's why this just makes so much more sense to be more, you know, content with that, you know, inner happiness or whatever you want to call it. Um, because again, that is just much more reliable when everything is changing and, you know, you can't rely on anything, you know, uh, in that regard. It's like, okay, yeah, so it's, it's nice. And to be able to also appreciate that change when it does come and when the weather comes, because it's like, okay, it's going to do what it's going to do. We can't— having that mindset has been so helpful in, in the winter when it's like you wake up and it's like, 'Oh, there's a driveway and it's full of snow, so let's go out there.' And that's good exercise right there. But yeah, you know, um, yeah, for sure. But like, just being like, 'Yeah, no, that's the weather. That's, that's what it's gonna do.' Like, we can't like change that. But that's also everything else, you know, in life. So yeah, and even— so it's interesting too, there's helpful Yeah, weather can be helpful. We can learn a lot from that.

**Speaker B:** I said each weather is helpful.

**Speaker A:** Oh, each weather. Yeah, yeah. Well, yeah, too. That's an interesting thing. Yeah. Well, when we take it though as like, you know, like, oh, we can learn from this, right? And we have that more like, you know, cultivation mindset, that growth mindset of like, okay, we can learn from this and we can continue to like develop our understanding of Dhamma. And what have you. So like nothing's lost. Yeah, in that regard. Not that I mean it's a problem if things are lost. Things are going to be lost all the time. But you know, if you catch my drift, you know, it's helpful.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's just enjoying the show. And then like when the practice is good, everything kind of sets off the reminder of the Dhamma. And it's wholesome all over again. So just like the seasons change, the weather change, the traffic's changing. Like that's always like when something changes and I don't expect it, it's always welcoming because then Sati comes up. And I've noticed that Sati has gotten even like more refined as I practice it too, because it's like it almost feels like sobering, like it's like, oh, oh shit. Let's feel good. Like, dance a little bit because my friend's here.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's interesting though, yeah, to notice sometimes how like if we kind of pull back and look at like the way that practice is going, like I notice It's like, you know, sometimes there'll be periods where, you know, there's a little bit up, there's a little bit more engaged with the practice, and then it falls off, and then it comes back up. And like, it's interesting to notice that, but it seems like once you understand a fair bit, it's just going to kind of automatically come back up because like once you've tasted, you know, the mind being free from hindrances, when you kind of know that satisfaction You're like, okay, we're going to come back to this because like, okay, you know, you might get caught up in some worldly things or whatever. But then, yeah, Sati comes back up, you know, you get whacked in the face with that and you're like, oh, okay, yeah, I know, I see that. And like, why wouldn't I? This is just like, you know, it becomes more automatic.

**Speaker B:** Why wouldn't I?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker C:** Like, like, right, wrong view, what, like how? It's just right, dude.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, somehow it convinced me. Yeah, never mind.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, precisely.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Never mind, start again. Yeah, another one of Mara's pranks here. That's what I like what Scott was saying, it's like Mara's, you know, pulling pranks on you. So yeah.

**Speaker B:** Classic expression.

**Speaker C:** And I really enjoy these Dhamma talks because they're like really great way to get the wholesome juices flowing. And it's just, yeah, it's like charge you up, get ready to take on the next moment and the next and the next.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, for sure. Like, I found them like very beneficial until— yeah, just have a community of people to talk to about this. And yeah, like really sets up the rest of, you know, the week or the practice or just reminds us right now to, you know, come on back and gladden the mind and enjoy.

**Speaker C:** Because most ordinary people, like, you can't they'll get really pissed off if you're like, well, just don't have problems. Take a deep breath. But it's like, I mean, I feel for them. I've been there. But like, being with other people who are like, yeah, no, no, that's it. It's much better.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. My brother, like I said, is going through some things and he was like, all right, I tried this whole Dharma thing on February and look where it got me. Nowhere. I have nothing to show for it. I like, I spent the whole month chilling and relaxing, enjoying myself, and now look where I am, in the same place where I left off. And I'm like, so how's this month going? And he's like, it's horrible, I've been stressing this whole time. And I'm like, so how's the work? Got any more money for your stress? And he's like, no. And I'm like, so what's the answer here? And then he just like stops and he's like, oh shit, Mara, you got He's a funny one. I'm trying to get him on the calls.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, no, it does. Yeah, it definitely helps to, you know, talk to folks and what have you. But no, that's— that's it, right? And it is helpful to see sometimes, hey, we pop out of it or whatever, but come on back in. But that's the— too, you know, what did it get me? Nothing. It's like, yeah, exactly, good job.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that's the point. He didn't find it as funny as me.

**Speaker A:** No, no, that's— and that's the interesting thing, right? It's like figuring out that and how to do it skillfully and what have you, right? Because like, yeah, no, for the most part, when a lot of the time when people are down, you know, they don't want to hear like, oh yeah, just breathe and do that. And you know, it's like, okay, so—.

**Speaker B:** But when you're— I said rest on your laurels. Yeah, I told them rest on your laurels.

**Speaker C:** He's like, I don't have laurels.

**Speaker A:** Oh boy, no rest. Um, oh my. Yeah, but yeah, no, it's cool though, because like, hey, when we're in like a community like this or whatever, we kind of like understand, and we're like, okay, this is what we're here for, to do, you know, to gladden the mind, to, you know, get out of hindrance, and to just come back and enjoy the breath, appreciate the breath. And really kind of like, again, learn and understand the Dharma together. And that's wonderful. I was like, yeah, I know when you go in the world or what have you, I mean, there is a little, I think, a degree of like understanding to this because like, yeah, sure, there can be a fair bit like it's like with like toxic positivity or what have you that people, you know, go on, what have you about. But this is a little different because this isn't necessarily even positive. This is wholesome. And there's a slight— there's a slight variation because it's not like, okay, well, you know, you need to keep your chin up and then you'll have all this worldly success and everything's gonna be like hunky-dory if you just, you know, believe you'll manifest, you know, the secret, all that stuff. It's like, no, we're coming back and we're being happy now, like this current breath. Because I mean, in all honesty, everything's constantly changing, it's ups and downs or what have you with life. So we're going with that thing of just like, hey, let's I mean, again, it's just understanding like nothing is worth clinging to and we come back with like, hey, just this right now, this is enough, you know. And honestly, when you recognize that and understand the Four Noble Truths and understand like giving up of, you know, the thirst and that quenching the desire and coming back to contentment quite easily, you know, that kind of, yeah, no, it goes beyond anything that we could possibly conceive of in terms of like worldly pleasure or what have you. It's just, yeah, no, it's absolutely wonderful and it's a marvelous, you know, treasure that. But again, it's also not clinging to that. So when we go about in the world or whatever, we don't have to argue with people or like somehow be like, okay, I'm going to convince you of this, because ultimately the person needs to want that, right? There needs to be that chanda There needs to be that little bit of drive that says, hey, you know what, I can do this before we drop and let go of, you know, the various different thirsts. And yeah, so it's trying to convince somebody to do that. I don't think it's going to be, you know, again, it's a skillful way that we can do that. Like we do that through jokes or what have you, or, you know, but it's just like, hey, or through our own attitude, you know, that sympathetically carrying over, I think, is another skillful way. And sometimes, again, just listen to the person, I think, as well. That can be like, you know, because, hey, you can go and do what— maybe that'll give you some, some benefit or what have you, and then maybe say something after. But like, you know, we can listen. But the skill then for us to cultivate, I think, and develop is like listening to somebody's like going on and then not picking it up, right? So caring for them as opposed to caring about them, like, oh, you know, I have all these problems and what have you, and being like, hey, you know what, I'm caring for you right now by listening to you, but I'm not caring about it. Because if I start caring about it, then we're going to get into like a discourse, we're going to start like fighting about it or what have you, where now I've got to fix all your problems, you know. And it's like, no, but maybe you just feel like having somebody, you know, to listen to. But with this, we get more into like with ourselves, it's like, hey, we need less of that. We don't need so much of people to listen to us because we can provide that, you know, for ourselves. We are kind of like a champion and we can let, you know, this stuff, you know, go. Not that it, you know, again, sometimes it can be wise to go and talk to people and what have you, or if you are, you know, not saying never to do that or what have you, um, but it definitely is helpful to be like, hey, I can be, you know, nurturing towards, you know, myself or to whatever these emotions are and handle them, you know. And that does, I provide benefit for the world because, you know, when we are doing this, then we don't— like, other people don't need to coddle us, right, so much. And that's kind of nice, and we can be there for other people as well. And so that's why when we do practice, it's really wonderful to remind ourselves, hey, this is actually a really beneficial thing we're doing, you know, not only for our own well-being but for the well-being of, like, we're— like, I mean, a lot of times all sentient beings. Like, this stuff is actually very positive, and it's actually very beneficial, and it's very wholesome. So really working that in with the Success is a really helpful thing, I find, you know, also to hype up the meditation, get that hype train going, you know, in a wholesome way, not in a way that's causing, you know, like, oh, this is going to be, you know, where the expectations are, you know, super high. Because again, sometimes the problem can be on the expectation. It's like, no, we can drop the expectations, but we can also really, again, build up like, hey, this is really beneficial. And that really helps too with like some of the stuff like, oh well, we're just sitting here, we're not doing anything, or you know, this is pointless, or any kind of doubts that might come up. And be like, no, by doing this, by practicing this and clearing out and cultivating, you know, mindfulness of in and out breathing, or Anapanasati, you know, we are actually helping, you know, to again benefit everyone involved. So the people we encounter as well.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah. It's easier to be a student. Go ahead, Saddha. That train of thought will help open you up to actually feeling good. And then that was proof in its own. And then you know there's the point.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, precisely. Yeah, no, because like once you directly experience that as well, and like just those good feelings that come and all that stuff, it's like, okay, yeah, no, that's it right there, you know. Sometimes it goes a little bit beyond language, but again, we can use that too with like the wholesome thoughts to kind of, yeah, really help work that in. So yeah.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, sitting there doing nothing is one of the best things ever.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's funny, one of the best no things ever.

**Speaker C:** Yeah. And it's like, like you, back to the whole cookie analogy, it's like, yeah, people spend years, uh, doing like weird shit, like testing themselves, getting jobs, finding a corporate ladder just to give themselves a cookie and then watch it fly away. And when you sit down, like, you could just be like, I can have my cookie now. I don't have to do a whole bunch of like extraneous things. And it's just, it's wonderful. It's one of the most productive things because then you don't need nothing from anybody. And you could be really like a better friend to people, not caring, like not needing to get your fix from them. So it's just like you could just give because you have so much and you feel so wealthy. And it's just a completely different way of interfacing with the world and things around you because it's like, well, it's like, here you go. I mean, like, I could listen to you. I could listen to you for an hour, just go like this and act like your friend. It doesn't bother me. Shit, I don't even bother myself.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And even when someone else is, let's say, complaining, they're kind of giving you ways of understanding them. And then that's kind of like your way to talk to them. That's their language. And then when you're talking their language, you can start talking about Dharma. And so by listening to them, we can figure out the words they use, the angles that they take, and then we can, like Dhammarato says, grab their hand and walk them out of the swamp.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, now that's a good way of putting it, Nick. Yeah, like start to like understand their language and and be able to communicate with them. And again, if we can communicate the Dharma without having to use specific Dharma words, that's when we like really know it. Yeah, you just kind of use ordinary language.

**Speaker C:** It's one of the best gifts ever.

**Speaker B:** You want the warm fuzzies. Legendary, lads. Well done.

**Speaker A:** Well done. We did it. We took a breath. There we go.

**Speaker B:** We did it right. Yeah, now we can chill.

**Speaker A:** It's making me think though, again, kind of going a little bit back to the sauna, but I was going to mention like the approach, right, of like, hey, I'm just going to take a few more breaths or whatever. That's like kind of like helpful too, right? It's also getting back to like, hey, just this one and just this one and getting out of— yeah, getting out of the whole like even honestly thinking about even timers or what have you. I think timers can be useful for rather than like, okay, I have to meditate. For so long. I can, right? Like, okay, like maybe there is something or whatever to attend to. So we're like, hey, we're free for the next, you know, however many minutes. Set a timer, we can do that. And if it doesn't go that long, cool, you know, that's fine, right? But like, just more like, okay, this is the point, rather than I have to do this for this long. I can, you know, I can do this. I can is another great sort of phrase to play around with as well. I find as a book Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** I think I can. I think I can.

**Speaker A:** It's like, okay, I can feel this way. I like, I can and I don't need. So like, another one is that's kind of playing around with the renunciation. Oh, goodbye Isaiah, it was great to see you on here.

**Speaker B:** But yeah.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, I don't need. So like, if something comes up, like, just like And sometimes it'll be random objects, but like, hey, I don't need that, you know. I don't, I don't need this thing to work out that way, or what have you. It's fun because that, that I find is another way to come back to just satisfaction and being cool. It's like, okay, we don't need this, we don't need that, we don't need whatever other thing, you know. It's not, it's not required. It's not, uh, for, for our happiness, right? For our contentment, for satisfaction. You know, but yeah, I know, just coming back to this current breath, just this one. And that is also so helpful when it gets like, oh, well, you know what, should have been meditating more, should have been practicing more, should have done this. And all those should haves, just coming back to know it's just this one right now. I mean, that's when it's really spot on regardless, because it's going to be just, yeah, this current one. Not yesterday's breath, not the, you know, it's just the one now.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** You brought up a question. I was wondering, anyone in here, I'm interested to hear what you guys have to say. Like, when I experience Dukkha, I don't really experience like a verbal thought, like I should have done this or I shouldn't have done that. For me, it's I just feel pain. I could just— it's usually in my stomach.

**Speaker A:** Interesting.

**Speaker B:** Um, but I never really think like, oh, I didn't do this. Sometimes, like, I wouldn't say never, but like majority, 99, maybe 90% of the time, it's always just pain. I would release the pain, relax. Sometimes I don't even know that it's pain, and that's usually when it's worked up its way to thought, and that's when I kind of bring myself in the first Jhana through like seeing that I'm safe, kind of talking my way into it. But most of the time it's not verbal.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's more just like, it kind of like the feeling sort of structure, right? Like it's just sort of like an unpleasant sort of position. Yeah, yeah. So you can kind of feel more almost contracted, right? As opposed to like, it being in like the form of verbal thoughts. Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting. Yeah. Because like when you remove the verbal thoughts or what have you, sometimes too, like the feelings might still be there or what have you. I find that takes a little while longer as well, right, to sort of, um, change. Sometimes, I mean, it depends, right? Like sometimes it'll just snap, kind of go away or what have you. But like the actual emotions and then the feelings themselves can be a little— yeah, it can still be kind of present in terms of like Dukkha. So it's like figuring out that. Yeah, though I think most of the work is like actually like again, the gliding of the mind, because that will change, right? Yeah, yeah. But it's interesting, and you put it like that, it's not so much in the form of like internal sort of thought, internal dialogue.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, usually it's like the angry feeling. I just feel angry.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Anyone says anything to me, it's immediate kind of there's like more of a jump into Dukkha instead of kind of being in my recliner and, uh, being able to say whatever I want to say.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** So a girlfriend helps me with that a lot.

**Speaker A:** But yeah, like almost like a pre-verbal thing. That's why, yeah, I think like actually like implanting some of the whole thoughts until it's kind of like that structure is like changed over is helpful. Like, even if— because like, yeah, sometimes I think a fair bit of it, like, I don't know, for me it is a combination because it will be like, you know, verbal thoughts sometimes, but then you have the reaction to the verbal thoughts, like the actual like underlying aversion or what have you in terms of that, you know, until it's spotted and sort of changed. Changed, right? But, but yeah, I find like once the thoughts train can kind of start moving to somewhere wholesome, it's like, okay, cool. And then again, if it's in that kind of thing, it's like, okay, we drop the thoughts and go just right to the sensations. But yeah, it's interesting too, because like sometimes if the mind is clear enough, I find like just being able to break it down and like just the pure sensation sometimes, like even when it's like an unpleasant or what-have-you sensation, like just being like, okay, that's just a sensation as well that's doing its, you know, vibratory thing in direct experience, you know.

**Speaker B:** The wub-wubs.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's just kind of like a, you know, that's sort of the funny thing. It's like when you start to see, oh, that's it. Yeah, yeah, like what is it, right? Yeah, you need to directly look. Yeah, so, but yeah, no, I mean the helpful thing, right, is when we recognize that and it's already like starting to change, right? So You know, I mean, there's change in that. Sometimes it's rapid, sometimes it's slow, sometimes it's like— but you know, you can kind of see that. And it's interesting. And to kind of find the gaps even of that. And yeah, but yeah, no, that's interesting. Yeah, I find too, like with that, sometimes you're mentioning like a hangy, like, yeah, sometimes I'll notice that. That's when it's like a little bit more hard to— not hard, but like it's a little bit more effort or what have you to change. It's very visceral, you know, as opposed to like a thought process kind of thing. And maybe from that, yeah, I know, like unwholesome, like verbal thoughts will arise or what have you, but it's like the underlying thing is like very sort of, you know, in the emotional structures. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that's where it's like working with it. But sometimes I find that's where also like acceptance and that sort of thing is helpful as well with like the, you know what I mean? Like that's for me anyway, like being like, oh, it's okay, you know, anger or whatever. I'm going to take good care of you rather than being like, okay, you're bad for this or what, you know, like trying to fight it like too hard, like solidifying another form of self, you know, and just being like, oh, okay, we see that objectively for what it is. You know, we see the Dukkha. Aha, I see you, Mara. Or hey, I'm going to I'm going to be gentle with you. I'm going to take good care of you. Anger or what have you. So I find that to be helpful on that kind of situation when, if it does get like more, um, and sometimes there can be a feeling of overwhelmed.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'll use that. No, I think that will help me speed it up because it feels like there's like a buffering. Uh, I can touch it and it's like it's buffering. And usually I take a little seclusion. I don't even have to leave the room, but I kind of just will face away from other people and just kind of try to settle it. But yeah, more nurturing I think would help speed that up quicker.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, that might be helpful. Yeah, yeah, no. So I think we've come up over the hour now, so— but it's been a really wonderful chat. Yeah, so thank you guys. Yeah, thanks for— and glad to see you on there.

**Speaker B:** Nick.

**Speaker A:** Take it easy, lads and women.

**Speaker B:** See ya.

**Speaker A:** All right, anybody else have any closing.

**Speaker B:** Notes?

**Speaker A:** All right, I'm gonna head out. Goodbye, folks. Glad to see you on.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato and Sangha friends, focuses on **using physicality, breath, and attitude to alleviate *dukkha* (suffering/stress) and cultivate wholesome, joyful states of mind.** Here is a summary of the key themes and practices discussed:

### **Core Themes**
1.  **Body as a Tool for Gladdening the Mind:** The discussion begins with how physical activity—like sun salutations, yoga, walking meditation, and even adopting an open, "victory" posture—can directly shift energy, dispel lethargy, and create feelings of success and alertness. The body and mind are seen as intimately connected.
2.  **Active, Playful Breath Work (*Ānāpānasati*):** A major emphasis is on **actively shaping the breath** to influence the mind, rather than just passively observing it.
    *   **Long Breaths:** Used to calm anxiety, settle swirling thoughts, and cultivate ease (*sukha*).
    *   **Short Breaths:** Used to energize, overcome sloth, and generate rapture (*pīti*).
    *   **Playful Investigation:** Experimenting with visualizing breath as energy flowing to different body parts (e.g., back, feet) to deepen engagement and understand sensation as a fabrication of the mind.
3.  **Cultivating a "Winner" or "Champion" Attitude:** The talk encourages fostering an inner attitude of success and capability. This is embodied physically (e.g., open postures, smiling) and mentally through thoughts like "I can," which builds confidence in the practice and the ability to find happiness independently.
4.  **Practice for Enjoyment, Not Endurance:** The group strongly advises against viewing meditation as a grim test of endurance or willpower. Instead, the approach should be **kind, playful, and focused on finding enjoyment in the present moment**. The goal is to leave any practice session feeling good, not "beaten."
    *   **Sauna Example:** One speaker uses sauna sessions not to torture himself, but to play with the mind's relationship to discomfort, leaving only when he is enjoying the experience.
5.  **Integration and Wholesome Living:** The practice is meant to be integrated into daily life through frequent, shorter, high-quality sessions that help maintain mindfulness (*sati*) throughout the day. This inner well-being makes one more resilient and a better friend to others, as one is less needy and more capable of giving.
6.  **Understanding *Dukkha* as a Fabrication:** By playing with breath and body sensations, practitioners see firsthand how experiences—both pleasant and unpleasant—are fabricated by the mind. This demystifies negative feelings, making them less scary and easier to investigate with a detective-like curiosity (relating to the Second Noble Truth).
7.  **Reliable Inner Happiness vs. External Conditions:** The group contrasts the unreliable happiness from external, changing conditions (weather, food, jobs) with the reliable, always-available happiness cultivated through inner skills. This leads to a simpler, more content life where one can "enjoy the show" of changing phenomena without being distressed by them.

### **Key Practices & Takeaways**
*   **Start the day** with an open, victorious physical posture.
*   **Use breath actively:** short breaths to energize, long breaths to calm.
*   **Make practice fun:** see it as play and investigation, not a chore.
*   **Frequent, short sessions** are more beneficial than infrequent marathons.
*   **Use wholesome thoughts** ("I can," "This is beneficial") to gladden the mind and counter doubt.
*   **Practice "I don't need..."** as a form of renunciation and contentment.
*   **When dealing with strong, non-verbal *dukkha* (like visceral anger),** respond with nurturing and gentle acceptance rather than fighting it.
*   **Community (*Sangha*)** is vital for support, sharing, and reinforcing this wholesome, joyful approach to the Dhamma.

In essence, this talk outlines a practical and joyful path where the body, breath, and a skillful attitude are used as immediate tools to create inner well-being, understand the nature of the mind, and develop a happiness that is independent of external circumstances.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several metaphors and stories to illustrate their points about meditation, mindfulness, and dealing with suffering (Dukkha). Here’s a breakdown:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **"King of the castle" / "Victory pose"**: Used to describe an open, confident, and receptive physical posture (like stretching with arms open) that influences the mind. It symbolizes being in charge of one's experience rather than a "victim."
2.  **"Push the car out of the mud"**: Describes using short, energizing breaths to build momentum and overcome lethargy or a low-energy state.
3.  **"Having it on tap" / "Tap water"**: Compares the internal ability to generate wholesome, joyful feelings to having a readily available, reliable resource. Unlike external pleasures, this "water" is always accessible when you're "thirsty."
4.  **"Enjoying the show"**: Refers to the attitude of observing changing experiences (thoughts, feelings, seasons) with detachment and interest, rather than getting upset when a pleasant "scene" ends.
5.  **"Sea legs"**: Represents the skill of maintaining balance and ease amid changing conditions, much like a sailor adjusts to a moving ship.
6.  **"Mara's pranks"**: Personifies distracting or unwholesome mental states as tricks played by **Mara** (a Buddhist figure representing temptation and death), framing them as minor annoyances rather than catastrophes.
7.  **"Toys" / "Funny toy"**: Refers to playful techniques in meditation, like visualizing the breath flowing through different body parts (feet, back, pores). This metaphor encourages an attitude of curiosity and experimentation.
8.  **"Cookie"**: Represents a reward. The talk contrasts the worldly struggle to earn a fleeting "cookie" with the immediate, always-available "cookie" of inner contentment found in meditation.
9.  **"Wet sock"**: A vivid image for someone who is moping, lethargic, and "soggy" with low energy.
10. **"Wub-wubs"**: A playful, onomatopoeic term for the vibratory, sensory nature of raw experience (vedanā) when observed closely.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **The Sauna Story (Speaker B)**: A detailed personal story about practicing mindfulness in a hot sauna. The narrator describes working with the intense sensation, shifting the mind until the pain disappears, and making a rule to not leave until they can enjoy ten breaths. This illustrates how perception of pain is mental and can be transformed.
2.  **The Brother and the Breaths (Speaker B)**: A short anecdote about telling a brother who is "like a wet sock" to "do your breaths." The simple act of breathing mindfully shifts the brother's state, and they end up laughing, showing the practical, immediate application of the technique.
3.  **Dhammarato's Victory Pose (Speaker A)**: A recalled story of a teacher (Dhammarato) physically demonstrating **Piti** (joyful energy) by throwing his hands in the air like a champion. This story reinforces the connection between body posture and mental state.
4.  **The Spooky Swamps (Speaker B)**: A brief, likely humorous reference to the Buddha going to frightening places for advanced practice. The group agrees that while such intense practice exists, it's not necessary for beginners—"we don't need to always go to the spooky swamps."
5.  **Grab their hand and walk them out of the swamp (Speaker B)**: This is a metaphorical story or image attributed to Dhammarato. It describes the skillful way of helping others understand Dhamma by first listening to their "language" (problems and worldview) and then gently guiding them out of suffering.
6.  **The Brother and "Mara" (Speaker B)**: An anecdote about a brother complaining that a month of relaxing Dharma practice got him "nowhere." The speaker points out that a month of stressing didn't get him further either, leading the brother to have an "aha" moment and exclaim, "Oh shit, Mara, you got me." This story highlights how the mind can trick itself into believing struggle is more productive than peaceful practice.

### **Common Themes in the Imagery:**
*   **Body as Map/Indicator**: Posture and physical sensation directly reflect and influence the mind's state (e.g., open vs. fetal position).
*   **Breath as Tool/Vehicle**: The breath is a versatile tool for changing energy—long breaths for calming, short breaths for energizing.
*   **Mind as Fabricator/Creator**: Many metaphors emphasize that experiences (joy, suffering, even the location of the breath) are actively fabricated by the mind and can be skillfully worked with.
*   **Playfulness & Experimentation**: The consistent use of "toys," "play," and "fun" frames meditation as an engaging investigation, not a grim duty.
*   **Inner Wealth vs. External Seeking**: Contrasts between the reliable "tap water" of inner joy and the exhausting pursuit of external "cookies."
