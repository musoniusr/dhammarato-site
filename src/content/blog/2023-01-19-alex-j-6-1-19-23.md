### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Because this is a very interesting way of looking at the Dhamma. Okay, that you're asking, Alex, about morality. Yes, yes, guess what? All religions is a teaching in morality. And the teachings of the Buddha is a teaching in morality. That's all there is. In other words, morality is how we treat each other, and that our society is built in a quasi-moral way, where weapons and wars and all kinds of things. Are happening. And there is an issue that humans have not learned to solve yet, and that is the issue of child discipline. We have not learned how to do it.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay? That how do you teach a child to be moral? The only way it can be done is through wisdom, when the child can see that what he is doing is wrong. Yeah, no amount of rules, no amount of punishments, no amount of metal detectors or anything that happens at any school board or anything that any adult says is not going to cause or not going to solve the issue of, in one particular example, youth gun violence. Or violence in general, that in fact has always been violence. The question is, what did the kid have available to pick up and use when he got unhappy, right? I remember chasing a child down the yard with a butcher knife in my hand. I remember doing that, 4 years old. I do not remember much of the circumstances other than I know where the kid lived, but I don't remember his name, right? And I remember a whole lot of stuff that happened in that yard. But one thing that I will admit to is I do remember one time chasing a child down the yard holding a knife. Yes, something had happened, okay? And the child, um, that in fact— guess what? Here's something very interesting. That was the last time that that had happened. Yeah, that the fact that I do remember it probably is that which prevents me from doing it again.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** Okay. That in fact, human beings, when they are born, they're not very well developed. But one hand, one thing that's for sure is they're 100% animal.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And that's one of the things that a lot of religions don't— we want to set us apart and not see us ourselves as part of the animal world because God made us special. But if God made us special, then why did he make us human? Why didn't he make us perfect instead? Why did he make an Adam that had to have an Eve? And why did he have to build an Adam and an Eve that needed that apple? Yeah, okay. So that's the whole point then, is that we are born as an animal. Let's get over that fact, right?

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** But the question is, what is morality in the sense of animals? That when two cats are fighting, or when two dogs are fighting over a bowl of food, We humans would think that's immoral, and the dog, you know, bad dog, right? Or when the dogs are in the house and jealous of one another and start to growl, or maybe even start a fight right in front of you, right? And we see that as wrong, right? And yet the dogs are just being dogs, they're just doing what dogs do.

**Speaker B:** Yes, we can't fault them for that. We can. It's just not making much sense.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. And when you pet the dog and you find that big juicy tick, we have the idea that that tick is bad, it's wrong. Actually, no, it's just dangerous a bit for the dog, but we don't see that, that we think of the tick as bad or something. So here we go, it's humans. That have invented morality.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And without it, we could not have society. We would in fact kill each other. Humans are pretty violent, and we also are pretty knowledgeable about weapons. That makes us dangerous, right? If we were— if we had remained at the level of sticks and not even graduated to knives, just baseball bats, that's the only weapons that humans could have. Guess what? When we don't think of apes, apes use sticks, right? Yeah. And when they're finished with the stick, and when they're finished with the stick, they lay it down. Humans keep our sticks and we polish them and we make them better and we sharpen them and we turn them into steel and then we put them into a barrel. And I mean, it's just that whole thing. And though And every improvement we make is just more dangerous. And some of the most dangerous weapons that humans have now are intellectual weapons. Right. Like propaganda and the news.

**Speaker B:** Huge weapons.

**Speaker A:** Huge important weapons that harm a lot of people. And biological weapons. But the point is that without morality, without some kind of morality, we would have already been extinct.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, probably a few times over, huh?

**Speaker A:** We'd have killed each other 3 times over if we had no teaching of morality. So somewhere along the line, humans started to get the idea of that. In fact, it's instinctual in the animals, so the idea of it could come easily enough, and that's them versus us. And what is an us, and how big is us? In other words, the tribe, right? Now, in South Carolina, back in the 1950s, in rural South Carolina, there were generally three tribes: the white people, the Black people, and those who didn't fit in to either one, which was me and a Jewish— and a Jewish friend that I had.

**Speaker B:** Okay, gotcha.

**Speaker A:** And so, um, by the way, one of the Jewish boys that I knew who was a bit younger than I was, I taught him how to play chess. His name was Ben Bernanke. He happened to have been the Fed chairman for a number of years, and I knew him personally in high school.

**Speaker B:** No shit, that's very cool. No way. Wow. And you guys played chess together? You taught him how to play chess?

**Speaker A:** But mostly I was friends with his older cousin, uh, Nathan Goldman. Yeah, who was also into politics for most of his life. But anyway, back to the point that I'm making is, is this tribalism that we have. We have tribalism, and that it's instinctual in the sense of where are my boundaries. Where is the unknown? Because the unknown is dangerous. Another tribe is out there and they've got better weapons than we do. Or in the case of the wolves, they set boundaries too, right? In fact, they've done a lot of research about the wolves and come to find out that they're human.

**Speaker B:** Right? Right.

**Speaker A:** They took a huge number of timber wolves, radio-collared them, and set them loose in Yellowstone. They did that 30 or 40 years ago, and they've been tracking them now, and they've got it down to 7 colonies. And those colonies are the tribes, and they— then those, um, uh, the data is solid. It's really solid that that radio collar goes into another radio, uh, um, another tribe, and it stops right there.

**Speaker B:** Wow.

**Speaker A:** And meanwhile, here they are just going along in circles around like this, okay, just staying within that community, okay?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So that seed then is, uh, is what goes into humans having things like racism, right? Okay, dividing up the culture between that which I know and am familiar with and that which I am not because the other is dangerous. You cannot stay out of your— you cannot leave your territory. That's getting even more and more so. I would think that humans over time would be able to integrate, and there's been a large number of experiments, but right now things are getting downright tribal.

**Speaker B:** Yes, right, in the most civilized areas, right?

**Speaker A:** Even in the most civilized places where you would expect people to be able to use their wisdom, to use their noggin, to come out of their tribalism, because in the way that we look at it, it's actually immoral.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, very much so, and unnecessary.

**Speaker A:** Right? Slinging Dukkha when there is no need to sling any Dukkha, right? Tribalism is one of the main causes of that. That's what I mean. That's just the one word that we can use. It talks about immigration Right. And, and move, and population movement. Anytime that you see— at one time, all humans were nomads.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** And we ran across each other, and the only thing that we knew to do when we crossed each other's paths was to kill each other.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** And so, right, that's part of the reason I think that the Neanderthals have died out. But there's also the big possibility that, oh, they didn't die out, they merged. Right. Which is then getting over the tribalism, getting over the otherness, and making friends with them and being in community with them. And pretty soon the two distinct species devolve into one species.

**Speaker B:** Right. How do you suppose that this relates to the Christian Bible story of the Tower of Babel? It's one thing that comes in my.

**Speaker A:** Mind when we talk like I have always thought from my childhood times about that, that it was a story of when people get together that don't speak the same language, they can't communicate. That's what I got from that. Yeah, that I don't think that God caused them to have different languages all of a sudden. When they were all speaking the same language. No, God caused them to have separate languages all along, right?

**Speaker B:** And when we think of God, we think of natural law.

**Speaker A:** Natural law. So the natural law is, is that these diverse languages learned— could not learn to get along with each other. So whatever project they had mutually going on fell apart, right?

**Speaker B:** Do you think this has much to do with like the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, the idea that this language and this culture is intrinsic to one's perspective and being. Is this something that we can clean in the same way?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Patterning, right?

**Speaker A:** Once you— okay, so this— we're just using this particular thing right now as an example, which would be tribalism, racism, otherism, judging a book by its cover.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that anytime that we recognize that we're doing that and also recognize the danger in doing that Then we can— aha, I see that. I see that I'm judging this person by the clothes he wears.

**Speaker B:** The clown suit.

**Speaker A:** Okay. In fact, I'll give you a clear, clear example of that. Okay. Oh, let us say weeks or months ago, but not too long this year. The Bacon house that was next door that we used to live in has been rented out. And there was quite a kerfuffle with that, but the cars going in and out, and now the place is really junky. I think there's 18, though I didn't actually count them, gas bottles all under the house in a pile, as well as 10,000 other pieces of junk. Okay, and then because of this, he moved in during November's rains. Now that I remember it, uh, the whole place got really, really muddy with all the traffic. Okay, so this is the situation. Okay, so this is just— that's the COVID Okay, right. And all the rocks that they put out so that they could have driving But that was all part of the moving in, but it took days and days to move in. And now I haven't heard much from him except that he's quite now a bit of a gardener because the house was absolutely a jungle. I mean, it was like Sleeping Beauty's palace by the time the prince got there.

**Speaker B:** Gotcha.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Well, guess what? Today, Tam brings me a handful of leaves. And it turns out that there's plants here, you know, because it's all legal in Thailand now. And so I says, oh, I want to go see. And I go out there and he's got a whole garden. And he actually picked up one of the potted plants and handed it to me to take home. Well, how about that, right? And he's quite a nice guy. I let my boundaries know that I don't know this guy and stop judging him, because in fact the judgment that I would use would be that of your typical redneck, because he had all of the redneck's equipment doing all the redneck stuff that'd be happening in South Carolina. So obviously this guy is a redneck, right? No, he's Thai.

**Speaker B:** Gotcha.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so yeah, that, that is a clear example right there of that tribalism. And we take visualities and then decide that we already know who and what this person is, right? Or the person Uh-huh. Or the first thing that we hear about them, if we hear about someone. And so people are describing, they may want to give a clear and balanced discussion, something good, something bad, and all we hear is the bad. And now all of a sudden we've got trepidation about this person.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** Because we're always looking for the danger, right? Because of this tribalism instinct that we have, we're always out for looking for danger. 'Cause in fact, the jungle was dangerous. And it wasn't the rhinos that were the most dangerous, it was that other tribe of humans.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** Why were they dangerous? Because they were just animals, but they had weapons. Okay, wrong. So that means then that morality is actually a man-made but extremely interesting and perhaps even an important issue. Because morality, in fact, may be life-threatening, life-changing. Matter of life or death is almost always a matter of morality anyway, right? That's why I would put morality in that category of important, because it winds up being a life-or-death issue in many cases.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** All right, that's at the extreme. That's where we start out. We start out as animals and we're introduced into a society that hopes for morality but doesn't know how to do it because we're all in it still animals. And so what— so, and so what the religious path is all about, whether it is Islam or Christianity, is trying to teach the people to be moral. There are consequences to immorality, especially if it runs rampant, right? That at best our society can only tolerate an occasional bad guy, but we actually have to count on each other. And the United States government is an example, is that you can't make laws and punishments enough. You've got to have cooperation.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** We have to have a certain level of decency. It's a level of morality. This is what happened in the 1950s with, uh, Charlie McCarthy, or, uh, or whoever it was. Uh, have you no decency, sir? Have you no morality at all? And that was enough to finally shut him up. He was the one who was finding a communist under every Hollywood leaf.

**Speaker B:** Every last place he wanted to look.

**Speaker A:** Any place he wanted to look, because confirmation bias, he found what he was looking for. Okay, and it was racism. Okay, the racism between capitalism and what is called communism. Right now, I use— if you use— if you express it like this, commune ism. That's different than communism because communism is propaganda. It's a lie, right? And it never did work. It was always totalitarian. Russia has always been totalitarian money or land grabbers. That's what it's been since all along. Okay, so, um, uh, and not only that, but the people who used to own the land are not Russian, therefore they're not us, therefore it's quite OK to kill them all and be moral about it. Let's just nuke the place, except that we want the land, too, and if we nuke the place, we nuke the land as well as the folks.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Q] Right.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dammarato] OK. Now, there is such a thing as a neutron bomb, but let's not get into that kind of stuff, because Putin doesn't have one. Okay, so let's get back to the point though, then, that all religions are moral teachings, and that in a way, the kind of stories that have developed and been told about Buddhism or the Buddha to turn it into a religion is for this moral purpose, right? Okay. And so I'm thinking now about a comment that was made by a Western well-known monk about Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, when this monk said that Bhikkhuni is in danger of destroying Buddhism. Why is that? It's because it's actually necessary to teach children a bit about morality. We can't let them go wild, we can't give them permission to do any and everything. This was basically what the Buddha talked about in Sutta number 38. He talks about that it's all greed. It's almost like in those primitive days of the Buddha, it was quite violent, quite ramshackle, because the rich boys were just out there, boys will be boys, wreaking havoc. And they did not have a Mayberry RFD kind of Andy Griffith sort of fella, right, to manage it. Okay, so, um, this, this whole point about it is, is that over that 2,500 years, this thing called morality has kicked into gear in many, many different societies. Okay, and because of the world travel that we have now, we're beginning to, just beginning to homogenize humanity. That has been diverse for, you know, hundreds of, maybe 100,000 years or more, depending upon land bridges and all of that kind of stuff. But there has been diversity, and that the way that we dealt with diversity was with a weapon because they were dangerous, and both each other thought each other were dangerous, and off we go down that dangerous path.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and so the whole point of the teaching of religion— now I keep grinding this in— is to teach us how to get along with one another. That's what Jesus was saying, is that if you have a traveler, invite him in as a guest, right? Now, uh, even in many of the Islamic countries, they have that as a standard. You have to provide for a traveler if he shows up especially if he's in danger from the environment, that you give him refuge. Okay, but when 10,000 of them come—.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay, big deal.

**Speaker A:** Mass migrations is what becomes dangerous. Okay, and so that's where the religions actually break down. We can do it one-on-one, but this mass herd idea is, is that there's too many of them and then it's dangerous. That, that's actually happened with Germany. There's too many Ukrainians.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** And right, that kind of thing. And before that, there was too many Muslims, there was too many this, too many that. And there— and the only thing that is there is that they're not German, right? Now occasionally an individual who is not German can come in and join the society. Onesies and twosies we can handle. But 20,000. All right, and so that means, that means then that mass religions break down.

**Speaker B:** Right? Because they automatically have this us and.

**Speaker A:** Them, and that the humanity then will go back into tribalism.

**Speaker B:** Oh, because even within the tribe, the teachings are, hey, come on, come get with the flock. And this is good when the tribe only needs to maintain itself, but as soon as it bumps into another, it's just even more of an uproar. You see that today.

**Speaker A:** Exactly right, exactly. So look at the, the issue of immigration, where in fact the United States in many reasons and for many decades has needed immigrants. Yes, but all they have to do is just mention immigrants are bad people, and all of a sudden those people who've left, they lose their Christianity about your supposed invited guest in.

**Speaker B:** Love thy neighbor, all that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, love thy neighbor as thyself, except the immigrants, because they're not Southern Baptist or something, right? Okay, so here's the whole point, is, is that then morality is not for the greater group, even though it's applied to the greater group, that morality is for the individual. You and me, in the way that we deal with people. That in fact, as I was saying, the entire teachings of the Buddha is a teaching of morality in the sense of cleaning out one's mind. And when the mind is clean, we don't hurt other people. And when we think about hurting people, sending that evil email, then we catch ourselves and don't send it. That in fact, one of the things that was famous about Abraham Lincoln that was in several of the biographies was that he would write nasty grams. He would just write them, hold it, and then he'd file those in the drawer and they were never sent from the White House.

**Speaker B:** That's beautiful. That's a very nice teaching.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] Well, the Buddhists though, will write that nastigram in their mind without even thinking about it, and then they will look at this nastigram that I'm composing, and I'm not about to send this thing, let it go. Take those thoughts out. We have thoughts of harm, we have thoughts of getting even, we have thoughts of revenge. We have to get that job done no matter who's standing in my way kind of mentality, and we plot in small things and we plot in politics, we plot everywhere. We apply that thought system that we have been harmed, we have been hurt, we have been victimized, and we need retribution, which is still part of that tribalism. This is part of that instinct, okay?

**Speaker B:** Well, we say we have a vengeful God, we have a wrathful God, it's all just big-time rationalization at the national level or at the religious level, or.

**Speaker A:** At the religious level. Now there can be a beautiful teaching in there if you can find it, and that is, oh, this God is a wrathful, vengeful God, which means that if I stay moral and clean I'm on his side. Let him go do his own dirty work. I don't have to do that. That's not my business. Let me just stay on the clean side. So that could actually— depends upon which way you use it, it's either Dukkha or it's Dukkha, Nirodha, right? So if you're the victim of the wretch, uh, wrathful, vengeful god That's different than being his ally, his good buddy, his friend. And we learn to be friends with nature. This is how we become moral, is by learning how to be friendly.

**Speaker B:** And this is Jung as well then, Carl Jung. This is the shadow.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. And so we even have to make friends with our darker nature, otherwise that darker nature is going to take control from time to time and start slinging Dukkha balls.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, left and right, up and down. Wow.

**Speaker A:** Now, when I first discovered this, I didn't like it very much.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, why was that? What about it?

**Speaker A:** I didn't like that the entire teachings of the Buddha was nothing but a morality teaching. Ah, because that's all I got in Sunday school.

**Speaker B:** And right, right, and it's all you hear growing up mostly— this, this, this, this, this.

**Speaker A:** That in fact, when I— I think Christianity has changed from this, this, this, this, and this. Look at this and, and, and get— clean up your act. Now the story is, oh, good Christians, you have all been so good and all cleaned up your act. Let's go get those immigrants. Let's go get those Democrats. Let's go get those politicians. Let's go get them Blacks. Let's go get them Jews. Let's go get the crooks.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the criminals. Oh, absolutely, the criminals. Or the drug addicts. I hear about the drug addicts all.

**Speaker A:** The time from those, and the drug dealers, right? Okay, all of them bad people out there.

**Speaker B:** Okay, the addicts and the dealers. Isn't it funny how they put them together?

**Speaker A:** And the cops, never mind the whole system.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and the cops too. Absolutely. Yeah. Oh God. Okay.

**Speaker A:** And as always, and it's always the other. Yeah. And so because of that, now we're getting back to that point about judging a book by its cover. And seeing the cop as a cop, as a clown, as a pig, as dangerous, instead of seeing him as a man doing his job, right, ignorantly, but he's doing what he knows how to do.

**Speaker B:** Exactly what we're asking them to do.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that we are as citizens paying them to do. But not training him well enough to do it, right?

**Speaker B:** I see it a lot when I see— I used to feel, uh, very— I don't know what you call it. I think we'd call it triggered or something like that when I'd watch how the police are equipped these days. Because after I got home from the wars, I noticed they wore the same things I wore over there, and in the back of their vehicles they had patrol rifles instead of assault rifles. But it's the same thing, different name. And I used to be so concerned when I'd see it because I couldn't understand why anybody wanted to bring back here what was going on over there.

**Speaker A:** Because we got rednecks over here too.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. That is so wild to me. And then people want to act like it's crazy when you have stuff. I had a friend, he redeployed from Iraq, and when he got home he had a lot of trouble. And he did the whole thing where I'm gonna be loud, I'm gonna attract a crowd, and that crowd eventually they're gonna call the police. And they call this suicide by cop now, you know, where you have the police come and you act in such a way— they did it in California as well. The man took off his body armor and literally told the police, take my life, because he understood that that was how those people were being employed. And that is the unfortunate Dukkha of that situation, is we just— we ask for it and then we act outraged when it shows up at the doorstep. And it's so sad to me. I'm so happy now that when I see them, I realize because of the teachings, you know, that this is a human. This is not— they're not taking on a strange act all on themselves. I need to be this evil thing. What is evil anyways, you know, other than something we really, really don't like, I guess? Because from another perspective, it's the same guy.

**Speaker A:** When an individual is on his own, he is much more likely to have the self-preservation instinct readily available. But when we get into a mob and get whipped up, all of a sudden it's we, it's us, and we all have the same goal. I mean, a very, very clear example of that is Mary Shelley's Frankenstein out of the— you know, everybody in town was scared of the monster until finally they got into the, uh, into the gathering. Everybody brings their pitchfork, they all get whipped up, and then they go get him. Yeah, okay, that's because the power of the mob, the good teaching, and that, and that, and that, uh, mob issue always is reacting to the issue of tribalism. It's our tribe now. We have gathered the tribe together, and now the tribe goes after that other, the monster.

**Speaker B:** And that's why the Sangha is so important for us to grow, right?

**Speaker A:** We have to have that Sangha because we can be there together without having an enemy. That is actually the cohesion of the Sangha that keeps it together. Not fear. That fear is the only motivator that people have other than this altruism. Let's be together because we enjoy each other's company, right? Which Jesus taught. That's the Anagami love. That's the brotherhood. Okay, right. But now Christianity has maintained itself through other isms rather than through community.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And so the religions wind up being ordinary because they don't have that whole idea of each one of us must be moral, and we have to remember to do that. Now here's a very interesting issue. We teach children, thou shalt not hurt, thou shalt not steal, whatever like that. And we then give a punishment that will happen, but the child hasn't experienced that yet.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Then in fact, every child will remain a thief until he gets caught and punished. And then his— and then he can see the Dukkha itself.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Punishment. Okay. Except within the Sangha, we have a higher standard than that. In fact, instead of punishing We rehabilitate.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** Especially for the small stuff. Now that depends upon whether it's an inside job or an outside job. If a monk takes something from another monk, that's investigated and dealt with within the Sangha with the understanding of rehabilitation. If the theft is for someone on the outside and the police come, the monks don't have much choice about it. They have to just— okay, you go do what you need to do, you're out of here. Okay, and so that's the way that the priest should have been treated by the Catholic Church.

**Speaker B:** Yes, right.

**Speaker A:** Instead of— because they had rotten apples in their barrel, they kept the rotten apples in their barrel and it rotted the whole barrel, right?

**Speaker B:** And Jesus said this, he said, give unto Caesar what is Caesar's, give unto God what is God's.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. This is what we're, uh, talking about. You— we each one of us owes things to the government, right? Why? Because the government exists, and that's all that's necessary. It's part of reality, even as ill-defined as it is. It's actually defined according to the way that we personally have to deal with it, right? So Janet Yellen doesn't see the, uh, the U.S. government quite the same way as the dog catcher does.

**Speaker B:** Right. Hmm.

**Speaker A:** Or animal control police, I think you're called now. But in any case, we all have our own understanding, and we have to deal with reality. The question is, can we deal with reality happily, or can we— or we have to deal with reality as if it was an imposition upon me, that I'm the victim here?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and you hear this, people say, 'I didn't ask to be born.' No, I don't think you had to ask. It just happens. But then every birth after that, every spiritual birth, that's if we can catch it, what we can stop by seeing dependent co-arising.

**Speaker A:** Right, exactly. So we have— that's why we want to remember to remember to look, is this tribalism that I've got in my hand that I'm about to sling at someone, or is it a goofball? You know? Yeah, we have to start looking for ways of treating each other well, right? So that's with the noble mind. So getting back to that child who is taught as a set of rules, when the child figures out for himself He will stop doing that. The problem is, is that so much stuff happens that we get no obvious retribution for. In other words, slapping my sister, I might get retribution, but hating my sister, right now, yeah, I don't even recognize inside. And there I am, full of all of that hatred for her. That only comes up when she does this or that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And then I'm boiling inside. And, and so, uh, this is one of the things that we have to start recognizing, is that our thoughts precede.

**Speaker B:** Everything, and they are in fact action.

**Speaker A:** They are the start, they're the seeds of action. That in fact, there's a Taoist saying that in fact, uh, the thought If you say and feel, you will then speak. If you speak it, you will do it. If you do it, it becomes a habit. And if it becomes a habit, it's then your destiny, right? And so this whole idea about people having a destiny and a predestination because God did it a long time ago— no, we do it moment by moment, our choice.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Our choice: are we going to harm ourselves and harm others, or are we going to refrain from harming ourselves and harming others? Or the better one would be that thought never comes to mind, right?

**Speaker B:** And only through Sati can we make.

**Speaker A:** That happen over and over and over again, because we have to gain control over several layers. We have to gain control over the world, and then we have to gain control over the instincts. We have to become fully human, not half animal, badly trained, and half human. We have to become fully human, which means wisdom directs our intent. This is where the word intention comes from. OK, right. Now there's two ways the word intention is used. One is for the long term, like the Chinese government intends to do the Belt Road Project. Good luck with that now. Yeah, all right. So plans are kinds of intentions, but we're not talking about that kind of intention. We're talking about the way the mind leans. This is the attitude, or the inclination, or the niggle, or the push. It's the thing that gives rise to the thought. Our attitudes give rise to the thoughts. A really clear example of that is, you just had a long bout, a prize fight. The winner goes to his room, the loser goes to his room. What kind of thoughts are each one of them having? One of them is, the fight is over, how relieved I am that fight is over. Oh, I really enjoy this massage. And they may even have thoughts about, I'm going to quit boxing. But one of them doing with the mentality of a winner, and the other one is doing it, oh, I got to get out of this. Oh, this is too much for me. Okay, he's doing it from the mentality of the loser. So the thoughts that they had then were influenced by the events of the moment and the attitude that they had in their mind about the events of the moment. This is Samma Sanghappa. We have to start changing our attitude about things, to come out of that victim's attitude, and the really only way that we can do that is with success. This is the value of Anapanasati, is because we keep getting success. This is a damned easy thing to do, is just change your mind, and it's also so valuable and wholesome that we can get the benefit out of that. And when we recognize, oh, I can't change my mind, oh, I can do this, then, oh, I can do this is that new attitude. That's, oh, this is hard.

**Speaker B:** When we talk about Anapanasati and we talk about the tetrads, in the third tetrad, when we talk about letting go and throwing back, is this because once we have gladdened the mind and made it ready.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's in the fourth. That's in the— oh, I'm sorry.

**Speaker B:** Yes, right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, right. That is dead. Okay, that in fact the story of, uh, uh, Anagami, uh, Gotami is what we, every one of us do. There was a woman who had her baby to die, and she didn't like it a bit, so she carried this dead baby to every doctor in the community, everywhere, all over the place. And some of them began to say, well, why don't you go to the Buddha? He's not a doctor, but he'll— So eventually she came to the Buddha thinking that he was going to do magic medicine. Right. And so he gave her the job of you've got to go take your baby and go to house after house until you get 10 anise seeds, sometimes called mustard. Anise is the treat. If you've ever been to an Indian restaurant, they'll either have it on your table or at the checkout where there's little seeds, very spicy. Okay. But the tick is, is that each one of these anise seeds has to come from a home or a house that has never known death. And she did not make it back to the Buddha with that baby. That was her lesson. She had to learn for herself over and over again that every household knows death. You have to let go when something dies. Yes, let it go.

**Speaker B:** Oh, and this is the fourth century.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and Jesus had the same thing. I mean, Jesus said it in a really stark way. He said, let the dead bury the dead, right? Because it is the dead who— those who are living in the past who do bury the dead.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, let the dead bury the dead. Let's come out of clinging to the things that die on us. Yes, because everything's going to die on us, right? Your dad, your sister, your dogs, everybody's going to die on you if you live to the ripe old age. The older you get, the more you recognize everybody dies on We lose everybody. Even we outlive our nurses. Sometimes we outlive our grandkids. But, but we lose stuff on a regular basis. I don't know how old— I don't know how old you are, but here's something. I have probably— I haven't counted them up. I might do that someday, but I have gone through now more laptops than I went through motorcycles, which is something in the 20s, and women, which is something in the 30s.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, all right.

**Speaker A:** And yet we get attached to this laptop, we get attached to this motorcycle, we get attached— and that motorcycle is gone.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** When it runs out of gas, it's not the motorcycle that we were riding a moment ago. Now this is a piece of junk. And that's because our attitude changes based upon circumstances, and we do it ignorantly. We reckon we don't keep track of what attitude that we have in the moment, right?

**Speaker B:** Because if we have wisdom, we can catch that, right?

**Speaker A:** We can catch what's my attitude, right?

**Speaker B:** When we see it, maybe we don't change it immediately, but when we sit with it, when we reflect on it.

**Speaker A:** Then we can see all this too is Dukkha. This too is Dukkha. And we do that enough times, and so then we begin to see even our attitudes give us Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Right? Because they're a type of existence.

**Speaker A:** It's the, uh, it's the back attitude of a loser, of the victim, of something's bigger, something got to me. Ouch, it hurt me.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Oh wow. And we go right back into that childhood instinct, right?

**Speaker B:** We start making a them and an us. We give these chairs.

**Speaker A:** A self rather than waking up and saying, hey, I did that.

**Speaker B:** Right? Yep. Hmm.

**Speaker A:** I can't blame it on something else. I did it. I did it. I'm a goofball, and that's okay.

**Speaker B:** Why do you suppose it is that we started in the first place with this idea? Does it just make things interesting? Is it just— No, it's taught.

**Speaker A:** Okay, this is taught. Everybody that you know that's older than you are had it before you did. Oh.

**Speaker B:** Right. Why do people stay in monasteries?

**Speaker A:** Because they recognize, at least at one point, that this world is a toilet bowl and we need to get out of here.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay, okay. I got you. That makes a lot of sense to me. So like we were talking before, I remember talking with you and with DJ and talking about how, you know, someday there's no more Buddhas. Someday there's just whatever this fucking shit is, you know.

**Speaker A:** When that happens, somebody will figure it out. That's the whole quality of the human race. I mean, we're talking about morality. Look how many decent stabs there have been made at trying to teach morality to human beings. Okay, I mean, without Christianity, can you imagine what this place is going to be like if we're— if in fact, if in fact there's any humans left, right?

**Speaker B:** If that's not the end of Christianity and humans, huh?

**Speaker A:** Right. Uh-huh.

**Speaker B:** Oh wow. So the whole thing is just what it is. There's a beauty in that.

**Speaker A:** And the beauty is, is that we have a choice. That's the beauty that nobody really understands, that we've got a choice. Are we going to choose the wholesome? Are we going to naturally follow the downhill path let gravity pull us back through instinct into the past. Oh.

**Speaker B:** I hear this when I hear about Satan being cast out, but it's not as if he cast himself out. He was cast out because he decided to rise up or whatever. He got some wild hair in his ass and decided he was going to do something other than what was wholesome.

**Speaker A:** All right. Let us say that every one of us has multiple personalities, and devil is one of them. Everybody has that devil. That, in fact, that's the instinct. Yeah, the instinct for greed, for power, in order to protect me from God, right?

**Speaker B:** Greed for power.

**Speaker A:** Greed for— that's an important point. Greed for power.

**Speaker B:** Is for protection. Yeah, from nature. But it never works, right?

**Speaker A:** So that puts out the point about what about spiritual powers that these guys keep wanting. The question then is, is that why do they want them? And who are they going to use them on, right? Are they going to take their spiritual powers to Las Vegas or the what or where, right?

**Speaker B:** Wow, man, that's rough for them.

**Speaker A:** Oh, and when we recognize that, no, that the real issue is, is that we're not managing our fear very well, right? We want power over other people. Now, the whole point about the spiritual power— power is to control, to get your way, to harm others. So power and Dukkha are related together, right? If you want power, that's because you already have and will continue to have Dukkha, whether which direction it's going in. And whichever direction it's going in, it cycles around. What comes around goes around. That's the cycle of Samsara. Yeah. So if we understand that, right at that point of when things contact us, what attitude that we have— if you can change your attitude, you've got it wired. That's the easiest thing to change, is the attitude. Then the thoughts are more difficult to change, and then our speech, once we've said it or once that email has been written, it's hard to retrieve it again.

**Speaker B:** Right. Yeah, that's quite the act to write the letter and put it in your drawer, especially when you know it's there the whole time.

**Speaker A:** But you gotta keep a very, very long draft list in your email box. Not a very few letters sent and a whole lot of drafts.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right on. So how Does one go about— how do I question that? I asked that question. What comes after morality? There's nobility.

**Speaker A:** Actually, if you think about it in one way, there is nothing after morality. The morality happens to be the result or the endpoint that in fact what we're really looking for is how does the enlightened mind behave? Pretty well, thank you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay, right. Yes. Well, so this is why we look for this to happen again and again like you're talking about. If we had one thing happen this time, but that's what happened, let's make it happen again. Let's do it again. Let's do it again. We're going to have thoughts, wholesome ones.

**Speaker A:** Every time we catch ourselves doing something immoral, even if it's just in the attitude, let's change that.

**Speaker B:** And that's the process of letting go, throwing back. That's okay, start again.

**Speaker A:** So here's an example, and this has happened at least once or maybe more times in reality, and that is imagine that it is an old Jewish priest using the same knife that he has used over and over again, whether he's called a rabbi or whatever. But he's the one who kills the goats in town. They do it in a ritualized way, and he goes out there to kill this particular goat who has this particular expression on his face, and it gets this old Jewish executioner, this ceremonially kosher, and he sees this animal, and he recognizes he can't do this. This is enough. I see what I'm about to do. And he sets that knife down, and he walks back into the house. And then every time it's time for him to kill another one, he'll remember this one, and he may in short order actually stop his business. Okay, he can see what he's doing. So that's an example now, because he was already doing the right moral thing. This was kosher. This was God's law. This is how you're supposed to do it. But then even a higher level of compassion, a higher level of wisdom hit him. The wisdom of Dukkha came to him, and he recognized what he was doing and recognized he can't do this. All right, that's a good lesson for us. Every time we mentally pick up some sort of thing, metaphorically a knife, that we're about to stab into something, an ritualized, fully permitted way, and we still recognize, no, this is wrong, let's not do this.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so you've heard me talk about action that leads to the end of action. Okay, so this is the example of that, is that when we see the action— so the real action is not doing the action, the real action is seeing the action and then stopping it, and that will then bring about the end of action. We don't do that kind of stuff much anymore, right? So we're going back to that child. We have to be able to see the Dukkha, and then we choose to do the right thing automatically anyway. When we can see Dukkha as Dukkha, when we see this is wrong as this is wrong, right? This is dangerous, this is harmful, this is to be avoided. And so when we begin to see Dukkha, that's why it's the first noble truth. It's really hard. I mean, I could talk for hours and hours. In fact, that's all we've been doing today is talking about that first noble truth, is can we see the Dukkha? Because if we can see the Dukkha, now we have a choice about whether we're going to continue it or not. So the real issue with the Dukkha is that we can't see our greed and our ill will. We can't see it.

**Speaker B:** What hides it? Just us, I imagine.

**Speaker A:** Until we do, right? Until we do. If we keep looking, we will see. And when we see, we make choices, right? And when we make the same choices, the right choices, over and over again, we can say, hey, I'm really glad that I've been doing it that way. But this is a better way of doing it. I feel proud of myself rather than caught in a system. That old Jewish rabbi was caught in a system called kosher, among other things, the Torah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, this is one of the reasons that people hide in the monastery. They don't hide there. This is one of the reasons people choose the monastic life. They realize that when they wake up, they see the Dukkha in so many systems. This world is a system grasping at systems, right?

**Speaker A:** This, this is a, a toilet.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** We live in it. Yes, we live in a toilet. And sometimes we can swim around, and sometimes we get the biggest piece of shit dropped off on us, and then down the sewer we go. And we don't wake up to the fact that we chose this. We're living in this toilet.

**Speaker B:** Man, that's tough. I went to visit our friends at the Lao Wat yesterday. Oh, good. Well, it was unfortunate. I feel like the— they call him their master. I'm not certain of his name. I didn't really catch it. But when I went to open the gate there, So they had an empty parking lot. There was 5 or 6 children that were outside of the little apartments across the street from it. They yelled at me, hey, don't go in there. And so I smiled, and you know, I love talking to the children. They're nice children. So I said, why is that? He said, you're not supposed to go in there. Nobody's in there. I said, okay. So did they tell you to tell people that? They said, yeah. I said, well, I'm here to see the head monk. No, I just want to say hello to my friends. So, are you guys gonna be okay if I walk inside, you know? Oh, he's okay, he's okay. Because they couldn't understand that I said head monk at first. I think they thought I said chipmunk or something weird. But when I went, I rang the doorbell. I couldn't ring anyone. I rang it.

**Speaker A:** This was a Lao wat. They would know the word achahn.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I will remember that for the next time.

**Speaker A:** But I remember that when I was— Teacher Maha means the head monk. They also know the word chao wat, which means the abbot.

**Speaker B:** That's the one. Okay, so what is unfortunate about this particular wat is they've been targeted apparently for burglaries and other such things. And I don't know what it is to extinguish fear in a human. I know for me it involves just looking at it over and over. But this poor guy, I think he may have been— you ever heard the saying getting treed by a chihuahua? No? You think all these big bad things are coming through the woods at you, so you scramble up a tree and you look down and it's a chihuahua and you're like, oh, fuck.

**Speaker A:** Oh, you don't even bother to listen to the fact that Chihuahuas sound a particular way. They don't sound like wolves.

**Speaker B:** Oh, exactly. We just go right up the tree, right? So this poor guy— now this is now the second time that I've went there that it's been like, I have a feeling he's concerned, and I don't know how to bridge that gap exactly because I understand it, I get it. It makes sense to me that if you have your house knocked over, which that is what it is, but at the same time, I'm a little confused as to how to approach it.

**Speaker A:** Okay. One of the things that is commonly done, one of the things that's commonly done here in Asia is that when a WAD is formed, people will actually go intentionally to buy houses close by. They do that within the Jewish community also. That in fact they intentionally do it that way because you got to walk to the synagogue. So wherever the synagogue is, people— so more than likely these kids that are there playing in the lot, the parking lot of the Wat, live in that area.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's why when I came back out, I let them know. I went over and I shook all their hands. I said, my name is Alex, my name is Alex, my name is Alex, what is your name? You know, all 6 of them, I shook their hands. And I said, hey, I said, I know that you guys are out here. You're doing such a good job for your community. You know, I appreciate how you're looking out for all of us and everything. That's so brave of you guys to talk to these weird white guys that are walking around here and poking around in these areas. So I know that you guys care a lot. I said, so I'm sure that when the master comes out and talks to everyone again, will you let him know that Alex came by? He just wanted to say hello to his friends. And that I was sorry that I didn't meet up with them at that point, but that I made sure to thank the kids again. So I'm hoping that put a little pop-pop for them, because I thought the same thing. I figured if those kids are out there and they're okay, that, you know, hey, don't go in there, then they're doing a good job of what they're told to do, you know.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so here's the question. Here's the question: what time of the day and what day of the week did you go?

**Speaker B:** So it was yesterday. It was in the early afternoon. Like probably like 3 something, right?

**Speaker A:** That, that's not a good time to go.

**Speaker B:** Okay, what is the best?

**Speaker A:** Mid, mid-morning is the best time to go, and the best day to go is on the weekend, and Sunday is the best time of all because that's— it's sort of like, uh, 10 AM so that they can get the chanting and the monks and everybody's community and all of that kind of stuff, and then they party down until about 1:30 and then and everybody's gone. And that's when you showed up.

**Speaker B:** All right, I got you. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense to me. That makes a lot. So I'll keep that in mind this weekend. I'll go ahead and recock and try and get back out there again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, 10 AM is about the right time to go. 10, uh, and 11 is the, uh, the magic moment. That's when they, uh, start lunch. So that you'll Finished by 12.

**Speaker B:** The last time I was out there, the gentleman, the two that were interested in talking with me, they were asking me, do you want to stay for lunch and whatnot? I know I had other commitments that day with the wife and whatnot because it was, I think it was New Year's actually the last time I was out there. So this next time I'll intend to stay there longer, eat the lunch, have a good time, wear my white, go on out. That's a pretty sound. What is that, a bird? Yeah, how beautiful. Okay.

**Speaker A:** That'S a good thing. All right, so, uh, let's just go back and retouch the whole point about morality now. This is that not just the teaching of the Buddha, but every religion is a teaching in morality. They just have various ways to enforce it and very various stories behind it. And the Buddhist method is to see the danger of immorality, see the Dukkha, see the dissatisfaction immediately through our own attitude. So the attitude is we're on guard, not up to 3, 4 on guard, but to guard the way that the dog sleeps in the yard with his ear kind of cocked so that if anything makes a sound, he's there for it. Okay, yep. And we have to be on guard like this, that we're listening or we're looking for this. The attitude is either a loser's attitude or a winner's attitude. And now that we've got the attitude of being on guard, it's a winner's attitude. And so every circumstance, any little thing that happens, is that going to change your attitude? If somebody steps on your toe or pushes you in the line, are you going to change your attitude? Nope, nope. I can maintain my Anagami. Hello, friend, you stepped on me again. That's the practice, and that's the whole thing. And when we have that mind at that level, then already we are not going to go out harming ourselves or others, that that's the noble mind right then and there. And the results of the noble mind is that you don't slug people because they stepped on you, right?

**Speaker B:** That's okay, right?

**Speaker A:** Exactly. And that's the metaphor for the way that we do with life. That in fact, I just talked to a woman, um, of course she's working at the hotel, and she thinks all the women at the hotel are catty and don't get along with her and, uh, compete with her. And in fact, when she recognizes, that's because she's afraid of them.

**Speaker B:** Yep, doesn't like to.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so she, so she gets her toes stepped on and she slugs back because she doesn't have the skills of recognizing that, hey, she needs to change her attitude right now, right? To stop seeing these other co-workers as enemies and see them as friends. They may not be competitive or catty at all. You're seeing that in their behavior because you're afraid.

**Speaker B:** Yes, and that's how that colors our perception. And once we have that perception, it collapses the options.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. So now we're generating new attitude, which gives new thoughts, which gives new speech, which gives new action, which which is not much at all, and a new set of habits, and now we can control our own destiny.

**Speaker B:** When we're open to the Dharma, it takes care of it.

**Speaker A:** When you're open to the Dharma, you're choosing moment by moment what your destiny is right now. And so the teachings of the Buddha is completely moral. Yeah, it's nothing but it. But it doesn't do it through a punishment-reward system. It does it through wisdom, right?

**Speaker B:** And is this why he told Ananda that the whole of the holy life is friends? Good, good friends.

**Speaker A:** Good. Yeah, exactly. That's it, right? That's that wholesome attitude. And you're not going to go around harming or hurting your friends. So you treat them very high, high quality, and that gives us a very high moral standing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and this is our character.

**Speaker A:** I have had several people in the United States mention this, by the way. The first time that I heard it was from an American woman who went with me to the Cambodian monastery in— it was outside of Washington, D.C., it wasn't in Silver Springs, I forgot exactly where it was. But she came back with the kind of feeling that she had been around someone that did live a high-quality moral life. And she had been going to the Catholic church. I mean, she was looking in a way, and she saw something in there. Later, years later, in fact, my mom had said, by comparing, uh, what she saw at the Wat with the preachers that she's known, that the Buddhist monks have a very, very high moral standard that has nothing to do with rules. It transcends rules. That is an attitude. Morality is an attitude.

**Speaker B:** And it's why people can feel it come off you.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's why it's so hard to maintain, is because the attitude becomes that of a victim, and now we need a set of rules to manage things, to manage all of these victims out here who are out for revenge and greed and ignorantly doing it. But when we all have the right attitude of friendliness, then we don't need any rules at all. Right now, what we've been talking about just now is actually in a book by Bhikkhu Buddhadasa called Dhammic Socialism. And he got into trouble with the CIA because of that and some other things. I mean, the CIA was hot to trot in the 1970s in Thailand, and they had counter— and here's something There was a counter— there was a— I don't know what, but we called them counter-insurgents that actually were armed. They were guerrilla fighters and they had their own newspaper, and they themselves chose Bhikkhu Buddhadasa as their mascot and put his name and face in their newspapers. So that— and he writes a book on Dhammic socialism, and the CIA actually hired The CIA actually hired a monk to go to Wat Sumannmok to spy on Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. And this monk then, when he was there, confessed. He confessed that he had been sent there by the CIA, and then it actually came out. Yeah, but it all is about this book on Dhammic socialism. Yeah, to where if we can learn to cooperate and communicate together, ever how big that together is, then we don't need capitalism, we don't need rules, we don't need laws, we don't need a lawnmower in every garage, and we don't need that many garages.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right, we could all just get along.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, we can just get one lawnmower and one garage that's good enough for 4 or 5 cars, and then, you know, and we live communally, we live happily like.

**Speaker B:** And I hear that in his teachings, and I love that he talks about that when he talks about when you penetrate the truth of the things as they are, you see there is no religion. There's just what you're talking about. There's just morality. There's just trying to be here, right?

**Speaker A:** And there's— in fact, there is no morality. There's only just— there's no morality. There's only just a happy attitude. That's all it takes.

**Speaker B:** Yes, right. And then we don't need any any number of— we certainly don't need any sort of an idea of this big self or little self or any number of things. There we could just be here. Yeah, and that's the beautiful thing of it, huh? And we see this in the Bible even. We tried to— we take it and we read it and we fuck it up, but it says heaven can't come to earth until everyone's heard the word of God, right?

**Speaker A:** If you understand correctly, it's— there's a lot of really good stuff in there. It's a mixture, but I mean, some of the best things that Buddha has to say is actually there in the Bible. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was really big on the Bible, but he didn't have to— he didn't have— he didn't have to deal with Christians. He just had the Bible by itself to go by, right?

**Speaker B:** Smart. What a wonderful thing.

**Speaker A:** And probably the English version of the Bible was read through by Thais when they translated it. They probably corrected some of the mistakes that were in the English so that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa had a better version in Thai of the Bible than common in the West.

**Speaker B:** Funny how that works.

**Speaker A:** Huh? Well, it depends upon whether you've got a friendly attitude when you're translating the Bible, or whether you've got the attitude, I gotta get it right, I gotta get it right, and if I have to get it right, I'll screw it up bad.

**Speaker B:** Oh man, I never even thought about that before. That's such an amazing perspective. Yeah, absolutely. And when you put in the idea of monarchies and all these— I mean, we have a King James Version of the How fucking crazy is it to read that and think of it as something else, you know? Holy crap.

**Speaker A:** Wow, that's exactly what you have. That's the Holy Bible right there. It's the holy thing. Yeah, the whole shebang.

**Speaker B:** And is this why when we hear about like, uh, Buddha Dharma going to China and they ask him, you know, what's the most holy thing, he says, wide open, nothing holy? Yeah, that's the most holy thing, right?

**Speaker A:** Everything is holy. There is nothing that is not holy. Depends upon the word, how and how you use it. If you mean holy in the sense of, uh, special, then no. But everything is sacred. Everything is holy. That's why I go barefoot, you know, because it's in the Bible. Take off thy shoes, Moses, for thou art upon holy ground.

**Speaker B:** Yes, sir.

**Speaker A:** Everywhere we go is holy. Pardon?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I just said thank you for sharing with me tonight. It's so nice. Really fills my heart with joy to hear all of this.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right. So now we know for sure what morality is. It doesn't exist. The reality is that it's the attitude. When we don't have an attitude correct and we have a society to deal with, we have to create a morality in order to learn to get along. When the mind is noble, we don't need morality. It doesn't exist.

**Speaker B:** Just this.

**Speaker A:** And yet when the mind, when the attitude is correct, then we have the highest standard of morality, morality of wisdom, rather than the morality of groups.

**Speaker B:** Right. Wow. And this is why rites and rituals won't save us. They always go.

**Speaker A:** Excellent, my friend. So let's go ahead and finish now. This has been a really fun talk.

**Speaker B:** Yes, very much so. Thank you so much, Dhammarato. I'll talk to you soon, my friend. Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with participation from Sangha friends (primarily Speaker B, Alex), explores the nature and purpose of morality from a Buddhist perspective. Here is a concise summary of the key themes and insights:

### **Core Thesis: All Religion is Moral Teaching**
Dhammarato posits that the fundamental purpose of all religions, including Buddhism, is to teach morality—how we treat each other. Society is built on a fragile moral framework, yet humans have failed to solve core issues like child discipline and violence because we rely on rules and punishment instead of **wisdom**.

### **Human Nature: We Are Born Animals**
A central theme is that humans are born 100% animal, driven by instinct. Morality is a human invention necessary for survival; without it, our capacity for violence and weapon-making would have led to extinction. We create tribes ("us vs. them") based on familiarity and fear of the "other," leading to racism, nationalism, and conflict.

### **The Problem: Tribalism and "Othering"**
The discussion uses examples like wolves in Yellowstone and personal anecdotes (e.g., judging a Thai neighbor as a "redneck") to illustrate how **tribalism** is an instinctual, dangerous pattern. This mindset causes us to judge by appearances, see outsiders as threats, and justify harm. Mass migration and political polarization are modern manifestations of this tribal instinct.

### **True Morality Arises from Wisdom, Not Rules**
The group critiques rule-based, punitive morality (as found in many religious and societal structures) as ineffective. True change happens only when an individual **sees the *Dukkha* (suffering)** caused by their actions. The example given is a child who stops stealing only after experiencing the painful consequences, not from external threats.

### **Buddhism as a Path to Natural Morality**
The Buddhist path is presented as a training in **cleansing the mind** of greed, hatred, and delusion. When the mind is clean, morality becomes natural and effortless. Key practices include:
*   **Sati (Mindfulness):** To catch harmful thoughts and attitudes before they become speech or action.
*   **Anapanasati (Mindfulness of Breathing):** To cultivate a mind of ease and success, making it easier to choose wholesome states.
*   **Changing Attitude:** The easiest point of intervention is shifting from a "victim/loser" attitude to a "friendly/winner" attitude. This changes everything that follows—thoughts, speech, and actions.

### **The Highest Standard: Morality Transcended**
The talk concludes that the highest morality is not a set of rules but a **noble mind** characterized by friendliness (*metta*) and wisdom. When one has this correct attitude, one automatically treats others well. At this level, "morality" as a concept doesn't even exist—it is simply how one is. This is contrasted with group morality, which is needed to manage untrained minds but often devolves into tribalism.

### **Practical Takeaways**
1.  **Morality is personal:** It starts with your moment-to-moment intention and attitude.
2.  **Watch for tribalism:** Be aware of instinctive "us vs. them" judgments based on appearance, group identity, or language.
3.  **Catch the thought:** Harmful action begins with a thought. Mindfulness allows you to see it and let it go (like Lincoln's unsent "nasty grams").
4.  **Sangha is essential:** A spiritual community (*Sangha*) provides a space to cultivate friendship without needing a common enemy, countering the tribal instinct.
5.  **The goal is a happy, friendly mind:** A mind free of ill-will and fear naturally behaves in the most moral way possible, transcending the need for external rules.

In essence, the talk reframes the entire spiritual journey as a cultivation of natural, wisdom-based morality that begins with seeing our own *Dukkha* and choosing, through mindful attitude adjustment, not to create more of it for ourselves or others.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use a rich tapestry of metaphors and stories to explore the nature of morality, tribalism, and spiritual practice. Here is a breakdown of the key ones:

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **Humans as Animals:** This is the foundational metaphor. Speaker A argues we are born "100% animal" with instinctual drives (like territorialism and violence). Morality is a human-made construct to manage these dangerous animal instincts so we can build society and not go extinct.
    *   **Examples:** Dogs fighting over food, a tick on a dog (not "evil," just being a tick), wolves with territorial "tribes" in Yellowstone.

2.  **Weapons as an Extension of Instinct:** The progression from animal violence to human violence is illustrated through the evolution of weapons.
    *   **Story/Metaphor:** Apes use sticks and drop them. Humans "keep our sticks... polish them... sharpen them... turn them into steel... put them into a barrel." This symbolizes how human intellect amplifies our innate dangerousness. The metaphor extends to "intellectual weapons" like propaganda.

3.  **Tribalism as Instinctual Boundary-Drawing:** The animal instinct for territory is directly linked to human social ills.
    *   **Metaphor:** The "tribe" is an expanded version of the animal pack's territory. The "other" tribe is the "unknown" and therefore dangerous.
    *   **Personal Story:** Speaker A's childhood in 1950s South Carolina, where society was divided into the "tribes" of white people, Black people, and those who didn't fit (like himself and his Jewish friend—mentioning he taught chess to a young Ben Bernanke).

4.  **Morality as a Man-Made, Life-Saving Tool:** Morality is framed not as a divine law but as a practical, essential invention for human survival.
    *   **Metaphor:** Without morality as a tool, "we would have already been extinct... killed each other 3 times over."

5.  **The Mind as a Garden to be Cultivated/Cleaned:** Buddhist practice is described as a process of mental hygiene.
    *   **Metaphor:** "Cleaning out one's mind." When the mind is clean, we don't hurt others. Harmful thoughts are like weeds to be identified and pulled.

6.  **Thoughts as Seeds of Action:** A causal chain metaphor illustrates how character and destiny are formed.
    *   **Quoted Saying (Attributed to Taoism):** "The thought... if you say and feel, you will then speak. If you speak it, you will do it. If you do it, it becomes a habit. And if it becomes a habit, it's then your destiny."

7.  **Attitude as the Rudder:** A central metaphor for the talk. Our underlying attitude determines our thoughts, speech, and actions.
    *   **Metaphor/Example:** The different thoughts of a **winner vs. a loser** after a boxing match. Changing your attitude is "the easiest thing to change" and steers your entire experience.
    *   **Metaphor:** Being on guard like a **dog sleeping with a cocked ear**, maintaining a vigilant, friendly attitude.

8.  **The World as a Toilet/Toilet Bowl:** A vivid, humorous, and pessimistic metaphor for the cycle of suffering (*Dukkha*) in unenlightened life.
    *   **Quote:** "This world is a toilet bowl... we live in it... sometimes we get the biggest piece of shit dropped off on us."

### **Key Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **Childhood Knife Story:** Speaker A's vivid memory of chasing another child with a butcher knife at age four. The point is that **remembering the experience of one's own violent impulse**—seeing the *Dukkha* in it—is what prevents its repetition, not external rules. This is a personal story of "wisdom over punishment."

2.  **The Story of Kisagotami (The Mustard Seed):** A classic Buddhist parable referenced by Speaker A. A woman grieving her dead child is told by the Buddha to fetch a mustard seed from a home that has never known death. Her failure to find one teaches her the universal truth of impermanence, leading to letting go. This story illustrates the **fourth tetrad of Anapanasati** (letting go) and the wisdom that ends clinging.

3.  **Abraham Lincoln's "Nasty Grams":** The historical anecdote of Lincoln writing angry letters to vent his feelings, then filing them away unsent. This is presented as a secular example of the Buddhist practice of **intercepting harmful thoughts before they become harmful actions**.

4.  **The Jewish Ritual Slaughterer (Shochet):** A hypothetical or recalled story of a ritual slaughterer who, upon seeing the expression on a goat's face, has a moment of compassionate insight, sets down his knife, and quits. This symbolizes the moment **wisdom transcends even religiously sanctioned morality**, leading to the "end of action."

5.  **The New Neighbor (Redneck/Thai Gardener):** Speaker A's recent story of judging a messy new neighbor as a "typical redneck" based on his belongings and actions, only to discover he is a Thai man who kindly gifts him a plant. This is a direct, personal **example of overcoming "judging a book by its cover" tribalism**.

6.  **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and the CIA:** A historical anecdote about how the monk's teachings on "Dhammic Socialism" (a morality-based cooperation beyond rules) were seen as so threatening that the CIA sent a spy monk to his monastery. This story underscores the **political and social implications of a morality based on wisdom and friendliness versus rules and control**.

### **References to Other Stories & Concepts**

*   **Biblical Stories:** Used as cultural reference points to critique or extract wisdom.
    *   **Adam and Eve/The Apple:** Used to question the idea of humans being made "special" and perfect, arguing instead for our animal nature.
    *   **Tower of Babel:** Interpreted not as God's punishment, but as a "natural law" story about the failure of diverse tribes (with different languages) to cooperate.
    *   **"Let the dead bury the dead":** Cited as a Jesus teaching parallel to the Kisagotami story—about letting go of the past/clinging.
    *   **"Take off thy shoes... holy ground":** Referenced to support the idea that a wise attitude sees everything as sacred.

*   **Literary Reference:**
    *   **Frankenstein Mob:** The villagers with pitchforks are used as an example of how individual fear transforms into dangerous, tribal mob mentality.

*   **Psychological Concept:**
    *   **Jung's "The Shadow":** Explicitly linked to the need to "make friends with our darker nature" instead of letting it control us.

**In summary**, the talk uses metaphors from the animal kingdom, tool-making, and gardening to explain human behavior. It leverages powerful personal anecdotes, classic Buddhist parables, and historical stories to argue that true morality springs from internal wisdom and a friendly attitude, not from external rules, tribalism, or punishment—which are often just refined expressions of our base animal instincts.
