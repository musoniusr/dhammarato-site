### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So you're asking a question about mindfully eating. All right, to start off, there is a passage in the Sutta Number 2 in the Sabbha Asova Sutta in the Anagami Nikaya, Number 2. Where it talks about it, and that this is used at Wat Suwan Molk and other places as a food reflection, in the sense of the reason that we eat is for the maintenance and health of the body, not for beautification, not for fattening, not for sports, not for buildup or our diets or anything like that. But only for the maintenance continuance of the body. So that's the frame of reference that we're using. So within that, the way to talk about it is that when you're eating, eat and pay attention to your eating. Now, one of the ways that the monks practice is that If you've probably noticed, mostly when people are eating, they're playing with their food while they're eating. In other words, they're looking at the next French fry, or that they're picking it up, or that they're playing with their— stirring their food around in the bowl, looking for the next morsel, etc., like that. And Actually, you could say then that humans are very visual-oriented, that the food tastes according to what it looks like. And we pay more attention to what the food looks like than what it tastes like. And that's actually especially true for expensive restaurants, where the preparation of the food is all about what it looks like on the plate. As opposed to what it actually is and what it tastes like. And so one of the ways of them to practice is that while you're eating, to put the fork, spoon, and knife down. Or in the case of the monks, they withdraw their hand from the bowl. But in fact, in India, many people, and in Sri Lanka in general, people eat with their hands. The Thai people eat more like the Chinese when they've got those big soup spoons and they've got chopsticks and whatever like that. But it really is also a finger food country to where, uh, finger food like in, in America would be a hamburger. You want to take the hamburger and keep it wrapped up in the paper or the plastic paper. But in some countries, they eat noodles, which are fangless. So, in the time of the Buddha, they didn't have any cutlery. So, they ate with their hands, and when they're not— let us say preparing, let us say a rice ball that's got rice and moisture and some vegetables, maybe some meat or whatever, and you pull it into a little ball, and then you pop the ball into your mouth, then you do nothing with your hands, and you start to pay complete attention to what's inside your mouth. So you draw your attention inside the mouth and begin to look at what's going on in there, tasting, feeling mostly, rolling around the teeth, the food in so that you can get the teeth to cut into it, break it up. And then the way to do it would be to suck the juice out, swallow that, and then continue chewing and taking the juice out and swallowing that until everything is a pulp. Now, I have seen Westerners talk about it in the sense of chewing your food completely well by counting the number of chews that you do. This is not necessary to count it. In fact, that's stupid because while you're counting, you're not paying attention to what you're eating. The full attention on the morsels in the mouth and swallowing just a little bit, swallowing the juice, swallowing maybe a little of the pulp until there is nothing left. The Buddha talks about it in the sense of not even one grain of rice. And so you run your tongue around your teeth and all everything, and when the mouth now is completely empty because you've chewed and swallowed everything that was in that ball of food, now you pick up the utensils and now you put your hand back in the bowl, etc., and prepare the next morsel that you're going to chew on. If you practice that way, it will take a lot longer to eat, and your food is better ready to be digested. To where you'll see animals that are, let us say, in a position of fear that another animal is going to get it. Dogs are especially that way, is that when they get a big chunk of, say, chicken, maybe a chicken drumstick or something, they'll carry it off, and then they'll take big bites and swallow it quickly. All right, a lot of humans eat that way too. They're in a hurry. And so the practice of slowing down and paying attention to what one is eating, that's the way to to practice mindfulness of eating or mindfulness while eating. Another thing that you can add to that would be the breathing, so that as you're chewing your food, you're also breathing. Be mindful of the breath as you breathe in. That in fact, when you're eating food, it's hard to breathe if you've got a cold. Because when you're chewing food, your mouth is closed, and therefore you're going to be breathing in through your nose and breathing out through your nose. And so some people, when they've got a head cold and they can't breathe through the nose, that means that they're going to swallow their food really quickly so that they can take a breath. All right, so all of those things would go into what would be called mindfulness while while eating. Now, there are some places— I've seen this in Zen, and I've seen this with some Westerners— that they think that eating is kind of a contest, that they've got to be finished before the master is finished. When he stops eating, everybody stops eating. So they're in a hurry to eat. But if the master himself is practicing mindfulness of eating as it would be specified with the Buddha, then everybody can take their time and chew correctly and properly. That in fact, I recommend one Western monk to leave the wat that he was in because the German monks there were doing that Japanese style of eating as fast as they could so that they'd be finished before the master is finished. And that's not the practice of the Buddha. That's competition rather than mindful eating, which is really paying attention to what you're eating. So you have any questions about that?

**Speaker B:** In terms of The.

**Speaker A:** Flavor.

**Speaker B:** So yesterday when I was.

**Speaker A:** Eating, I'd.

**Speaker B:** Done like a short fast for maybe 20 hours and had the food. Then I was just noticing as I was eating it, my mind just goes crazy to the flavors, you know. Oh, garlic. Oh, crispy.

**Speaker A:** Crispiness.

**Speaker B:** You stay above the flavor, if that makes.

**Speaker A:** Sense. I'm not sure that you would call it that. I would be sure to say, however, is Experience the flavors, to experience the food that you're eating, the textures, the taste, the aromas, the hardness, the.

**Speaker B:** Softness. And what about the pleasure from.

**Speaker A:** It? Actually, if you pay attention to it this way, the pleasure of it is not so important anymore. That in fact, the pleasure is a factor of greed, because people eat fast and they don't experience the flavors very well. And so, they're the ones who were really interested in the flavor, sort of like an example would be that you could take a very small sip of something, maybe syrup, Coca-Cola, or maybe a wine or something. But if people really are greedy for the flavor of it, they'll gulp it down. Guzzle, guzzle, guzzle, guzzle, guzzle, as opposed to sipping it and paying close attention to it. That you probably know about wine tasting, that wine tasting is not about the drinking of the wine. It's about paying attention to the aroma, paying attention to what they call the bouquet, paying attention to the taste of the wine. And that's what is done for all of the eating when practicing in the style of the Buddha. And so it's not about pleasure. Not for beautification, not for pleasure. It's only for the nourishment and well-being of the body. So pay close attention to the flavors because they're just flavors. The greed— in fact, you can, you know what I'm talking about— that when you're really greedy for the taste, you try to eat it quickly. You want to put more and more and more of it in your mouth to get maximum pleasure, and you're actually not getting the pleasure out of it because you're too busy eating and swallowing to actually pay attention to the.

**Speaker B:** Flavors. My parents used to hate that. Slow down, slow down. And I still do. There's only now I'm trying to change that, eat more mindfully. After a while, I mean, just yesterday being the first time, the food just feels like matter almost, not even flavor.

**Speaker A:** All right, so I think we pretty well covered that topic. Do you have another.

**Speaker B:** Question? The next question was, so I joined the Open Sangha Foundation website, and under your profile I saw a long sort of description, and in there you were saying things like about people. So let's say if someone does something, they have every right to do that, just as we do. Does that make.

**Speaker A:** Sense? Actually, I'm not too familiar with that. I know that something got posted in the— in one of those places. Okay, but I, I don't remember what it is. I didn't ever pay attention to it. I had the idea that it needs to be removed, but they haven't gotten around to removing.

**Speaker B:** It. It was something pointing towards the Lions when dealing with people. And, you know, I think it was coming more into the way we judge people in our life. Let's say it could be something as simple as, I don't know, someone being upset or angry next to you or sitting next to you in a not very nice way, and just accepting it and just understanding, like, that person can do that, like, it doesn't need to affect you. That makes sense. I think maybe it was pointing towards the Metta Buddhism. It was, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So I don't know if I've lost you. Well, um, all right, let's start with this. Metta was not a teaching of the Buddha. He did not teach Metta. He taught removal from Dukkha, dissatisfaction. People who are practicing Metta all generally create dissatisfaction. They see the dissatisfaction in the other person, and then they use Metta to try to smooth over it. It's almost like Metta is a paring knife that's trying to remove all of the brown spots off of the cauliflower or something. Okay, and the Buddha didn't practice that. He practiced it's important for you to get your mind straightened out and forget about all of this other people. That would be the difference then between the Theravada, which is called by the Mahayana the Hinayana, the little boat, big boat. Have you heard about those distinctions? Okay. Mahayana came much later, centuries after the teaching of the Buddha, and they have the idea that all beings have to be happy. They have a thing called the Bodhisattva vow: may all beings be enlightened before I get enlightened. And that's ridiculous. That's not going to happen. It hasn't happened ever. We've had, let's say, dozens if not hundreds, maybe even thousands of people who have become enlightened in the past 2,500 years. But there's never ever been an occasion where you could walk down the street and not see suffering everywhere you go. So, that idea of trying to fix other people, you can just forget about it. That in fact, to think that you can fix other people actually means, in reverse it is, is that, "Oh, that means that I've got to go find someone else, maybe a guru or or a teacher or a doctor or something to fix me. This is the whole basis of Christianity, is that you need a plastic Jesus on the dashboard of your truck or you're going to crash into a tree. You need Jesus, right? That's their whole teaching. And the point about the teaching of the Buddha is with the Four Noble Truths, the Second Noble Truth, if you understand it correctly, You understand that only you can stop your own Dukkha, because it's you that has to stop your ignorance, stop your stupidity, stop your own delusions about your wants and desires and delusions and all of that kind of stuff, that only you can fix you. The example that you could use is a guide goes to the piano teacher once a week, and once a week the piano teacher hears what he's playing on the piano and makes some corrections for him. She can see his fingering, etc., like that. But sitting in the meditation hall, nobody knows what's on in your mind. You can't read other people's minds. The only thing you can do is read their posture. That's a great pointer, especially when people are not mindful of their posture. And so they give away all kinds of information about their mind. But someone who is mindful of the posture, you don't know what they're thinking. So how can you fix.

**Speaker B:** Them?

**Speaker A:** All right, so don't worry about other people. Worry about can you be fine? Can you be okay even if you're sitting on some transit a bus or a train or something, and you can't change seats that you're in because it's a full house, but you can in fact sit beside someone who is being obnoxious to other people around them, and this guy— you're paying him no attention. They're all— you can actually do is to, let us say, be overflowing with your own joy, that you can smile at other people knowing that people like to be smiled at. They don't like to be pussed at, but they like to be smiled at. They want to be acceptable. To where a real Anicca doesn't care about being accepted because he knows that acceptance is not going to solve any of his problems. Only he can solve his own problems. That our society teaches us to go out and look for love, and everybody winds up looking for love in all the wrong places— in the bars, in the brothels, at the dance hall, the discos if they still got any of those around, okay. And nobody ever finds love in a bar or a disco. You're much better likely to go to a wat and find acceptance there. But the real teaching of the Buddha is, why do you want love? They say, some of them, the ordinary people, those who have been indoctrinated into Christianity, would say, love yourself. But that's not really the case. The reality is, is that you don't need love. You're already okay the way you are. You don't need to be loved. You don't have to love yourself because you're already okay. Love is not healing, and yet that's what our society teaches. You don't need to love the guy next to you. What you need to do instead is get yourself out of your own dissatisfactions. It's almost like that love is kind of a medicine. It's a salve that heals your wounds. Well, if you don't have any wounds, you don't need any medicine. If you're not wounded, if you're healthy, you don't need any pills. And so you don't need to give any pills or medicine to other people, but a smile will do. You've probably heard, you know, the word doctor is shortened to Dr. Well, I would prefer to have the initials RD, which stands for Reader's Digest, because in that magazine they had an article every month. They come out with it, and that article was always, laughter is the best medicine. So laugh and smile at people, that's the medicine. But you don't have to love them. Because the laughter and the smiles comes within you, and you're not trying to fix those people. So does that answer that.

**Speaker B:** Question? Yes. Very.

**Speaker A:** Interesting.

**Speaker B:** I think, yeah, like I spoke about last time, I think the whole way I've lived my life is so resistful and always trying hard, working hard. It's a bit routine, but like just turning that around and just chilling and letting things happen and doing things and.

**Speaker A:** Not— See, everything that you used to call work, see it as a toy to play with, that you're just playing here. If you're a chef, just have fun making food. You don't have to be in a hurry. They'll wait. And if your restaurant is crowded, you need another chef. You're there to take your time. Enjoy yourself. So you have an empty day and there's nobody in business, and you cook a little food and you're all okay. The next time there's a full house, you can still cook the same way. You don't have to be in a hurry because everybody's sitting there waiting on their.

**Speaker B:** Food. They can wait.

**Speaker A:** They can wait. Yeah, I'm having fun here. No need to pressurize yourself because they're pressurized over not getting their food on.

**Speaker B:** Time. That's very good.

**Speaker A:** Advice. And so the businessman will say, oh, but you'll lose customers. The answer to that is, well, you've already got too many customers. It's a full house. You don't need so many. You're here to enjoy your life, not to hustle because things are busy. It's only those who are greedy for money that want you to hurry. Life can be really easy and fun when you take the work and the hurry out of it and just enjoy what you're.

**Speaker B:** Doing. Yes, it's funny because like when it's really busy, I don't enjoy it, and then when it's really quiet, I don't enjoy it. Like, when you ever gonna enjoy it? Just enjoy it no matter what it.

**Speaker A:** Is. That's right. When it's really busy, you're really busy yourself on the inside and working and hard and all of that when you're full house. And then when it's empty, now you're worried about the money, there's nobody here. And so you wind— and, and so you wind up being unhappy on all of the extremes. And the way to handle it is just be happy. Doesn't matter whether it's an empty house or a full.

**Speaker B:** House.

**Speaker A:** In fact, I would prefer an empty house. Then we got nothing to do.

**Speaker B:** That's why I got down with the.

**Speaker A:** Spray.

**Speaker B:** Have Dharma.

**Speaker A:** Conversations, just kill the day. So what's next?

**Speaker B:** I think, I think that's covered what's on my mind. All.

**Speaker A:** Right, apply it. Well, practice well. Practice, remember, is repetitive. You've been in the habit of feeling bad for all of these years. How many times have you felt bad in the past 10 years? 100,000 times? 3 million times?

**Speaker B:** Too many times.

**Speaker A:** Many times. So now it's time to practice being happy, being okay. You're well skilled at being dissatisfied. Now let's get well skilled at being satisfied.

**Speaker B:** Practice. I mean, before I was doing like, I was trying to do meditation. I wasn't doing this basic groundwork of just being happy now, and I feel like I would have ups and downs. It would be good when the meditation was good, and then up, then down, and then up. But this just seems very, very level.

**Speaker A:** Right. That's why I generally do not use the word meditation because it's loaded down with baggage in the West. Contemplations, wanting things out of it and whatnot, where the correct practice is, never mind, everything is okay, it's good enough the way that it is, everything is okay, everything is fine, let's have some fun here. That's The real practice, not meditation, is to see all of those unwholesome thoughts and throw them out and say, huh, we're having a ball here, we're having fun here. Instead of saying don't bother me, I'm having fun, you can say, oh, I'm having fun, you can't bother me. Only I can bother me, and I choose not to do that right now. So you go practice, and we'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** See you later. How— how— sorry, just one quick— how do I join the Sangha calls? Because I couldn't find the.

**Speaker A:** Link. Which one, on Discord or on Skype.

**Speaker B:** Or Uh, any— all right, you know.

**Speaker A:** The, um, uh, the YouTube channel? Okay, you can go to any of the really latest videos and it's got a full description.

**Speaker B:** Oh, it'll be— the link will be in the description?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, all the links are in the description for every new video, even the old ones with some of the old links. You know, they, they change and whatnot. So every time we change the, uh, uh, this, the settings for the, uh, default, uh, discussion, we keep adding stuff to it. And so we've got Skype and we've got Discord and we've got, uh, several other things including the website and whatnot. So it's all in there.

**Speaker B:** Okay, perfect. That makes sense. All right. Okay, thank you very.

**Speaker A:** Much. Take care. Bye-bye. Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a Sangha friend (Speaker B), covers two main topics: mindful eating and the core attitude for practice. Here is a summary:

### **1. Mindful Eating**
Dhammarato explains the practice based on the Buddha's teaching that food is for the health and maintenance of the body, not for pleasure, beautification, or sport.
*   **Method:** Eat slowly and with full attention. Put down utensils (or withdraw your hand from the bowl) between bites. Focus completely on the food in your mouth—its taste, texture, and the process of chewing. Chew until the food becomes a pulp, swallowing the juices gradually, until "not even one grain of rice" remains.
*   **Key Points:**
    *   Avoid being visually distracted by the next bite; focus on the sensory experience in the mouth.
    *   Do not count chews, as that distracts from the direct experience.
    *   This practice improves digestion and counters the habit of hurried, greedy eating.
    *   The pleasure of flavor is not the goal. When eating mindfully, the greed for intense pleasure subsides, and food is experienced more as simple sensation.

### **2. The Core Attitude: Fix Yourself, Not Others**
The discussion shifts to dealing with difficult people and the purpose of practice. Dhammarato presents a direct, Theravada perspective.
*   **Primary Focus:** Your own mind. The core of the Buddha's teaching (the Second Noble Truth) is that **only you can end your own suffering (dukkha)** by removing your own ignorance, desire, and delusion. You cannot read or fix others' minds.
*   **On "Metta" (Loving-Kindness):** Dhammarato states that Metta, as commonly practiced to fix others' suffering, was not the Buddha's primary teaching. He contrasts this with the Mahayana Bodhisattva vow, which he views as impractical. The priority is to "get your mind straightened out."
*   **Practical Approach:** Instead of trying to love or change others, cultivate internal well-being. If you are joyful and okay within yourself, you can naturally smile and be pleasant. This is more effective than seeking external love or applying "love" as a medicine for wounds. If you have no inner wounds, you don't need that medicine.
*   **General Life Advice:** Transform your attitude toward work and life. See activities as "toys to play with," not as stressful work. Whether your environment is busy or quiet, choose to enjoy the process. The habit of a lifetime has been dissatisfaction; now, practice being satisfied and happy as a new skill.

### **Overall Theme**
The talk emphasizes **direct, personal practice** over complex philosophies. The path is to:
1.  Cultivate mindfulness in simple, daily acts like eating.
2.  Take full responsibility for your own mental state, letting go of the need to control, judge, or fix others.
3.  Replace the ingrained habit of dissatisfaction with a consistent attitude of contentment and enjoyment in the present moment, regardless of external conditions.

Dhammarato concludes by advising the listener to practice this attitude repetitively, framing true practice as choosing fun and okay-ness over being bothered by unwholesome thoughts.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate their points about mindfulness, practice, and attitude. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors:**

1.  **Metta as a Paring Knife:** The speaker criticizes the popular Buddhist concept of *Metta* (loving-kindness) by comparing it to a tool used to superficially fix imperfections:
    > "It's almost like Metta is a **paring knife** that's trying to remove all of the brown spots off of the cauliflower."

2.  **Love as Medicine/Salve:** The speaker reframes the societal quest for love as an unnecessary treatment for a wound that doesn't exist if one is mentally healthy:
    > "It's almost like that love is kind of a **medicine**. It's a **salve that heals your wounds**. Well, if you don't have any wounds, you don't need any medicine."

3.  **Work as a Toy:** To combat a stressful, effortful attitude toward life and work, the speaker advises seeing activities as play:
    > "See, everything that you used to call work, see it as a **toy to play with**, that you're just playing here."

4.  **Visual-Oriented Eating:** Describes how people often eat with their eyes, prioritizing appearance over taste, especially in certain settings:
    > "Humans are very **visual-oriented**, that the food tastes according to what it looks like."

### **Stories & Anecdotes:**

1.  **The Hurrying Monks:** The speaker tells a story about monks in a wat (temple) who eat quickly as a competition to finish before their master, contrasting this with the Buddha's prescribed method of mindful eating.
    > "I recommend one Western monk to leave the wat that he was in because the German monks there were doing that Japanese style of eating as fast as they could... That's **competition rather than mindful eating**."

2.  **The Guzzling vs. Sipping Drinker:** This short anecdote contrasts a greedy approach to flavor with a mindful one, using drinking as an example:
    > "If people really are greedy for the flavor... they'll **gulp it down. Guzzle, guzzle, guzzle**... as opposed to **sipping it and paying close attention to it**."

3.  **The Scared Dog / Hurrying Human:** Uses the image of an animal (or person) eating quickly out of fear or hurry to illustrate unmindful eating.
    > "Dogs are especially that way... they'll take big bites and swallow it quickly. All right, **a lot of humans eat that way too**. They're in a hurry."

4.  **The Piano Student:** Uses the analogy of learning an instrument to explain why you can't fix another person's mind—only they can do their own "practice."
    > "The example that you could use is a **guide goes to the piano teacher once a week**... But sitting in the meditation hall, **nobody knows what's on in your mind**. You can't read other people's minds."

5.  **Reader's Digest "Doctor":** A personal, slightly humorous story where the speaker prefers the initials "R.D." (for *Reader's Digest*) over "Dr.," referencing the magazine's famous phrase to advocate for joy over love.
    > "I would prefer to have the initials RD, which stands for Reader's Digest, because in that magazine... that article was always, **'laughter is the best medicine.'** So laugh and smile at people, that's the medicine."

### **Key Framing Concepts (Extended Metaphors):**
*   **The "Frame of Reference" for Eating:** The entire discussion on eating is framed by a sutta (scripture) that defines eating **solely as "fuel" for the body's maintenance**, not for pleasure, beauty, or sport.
*   **The "Little Boat vs. Big Boat" (Hinayana vs. Mahayana):** This classic Buddhist metaphor is referenced to contrast the Theravada focus on individual liberation (fixing yourself) with the Mahayana ideal of liberating all beings (fixing others), which the speaker dismisses as impractical.

These metaphors and stories effectively translate abstract Buddhist principles—like mindfulness, non-attachment, and self-responsibility—into relatable, concrete images and scenarios.
