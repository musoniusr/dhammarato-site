### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So as I was starting to say, in the Kamsambhian Sutta, number 48 in the Majjhima Nikaya, after the preliminaries, the Buddha talks about the five hindrances and lists them actually, but in this sutta, they're referred to as obstructions. And I imagine that obstructions and hindrances are interchangeable. And then he says that there comes a point in time, he calls it in fact the first knowledge. And the first knowledge is that no matter how obstructed the mind becomes or how much hindrances it has, the student knows without a doubt that he can come out of that. You can come out of those hindrances and see things the way that they actually are, see the reality of the situation. Now that's actually the attitude that grows by correct practice. And the correct practice is continuously, on a regular basis, removing the hindrances, or in other places in sutras he talks about them as unwholesome thoughts, and to remove those unwholesome thoughts and put happy, wholesome, winner's thoughts in place. And when we do that over and over again, what that means is that we are remembering Sati, to look, ditti, and then take the right noble effort to remove those unwholesome thoughts and put in wholesome thoughts, to remove the hindrances from the mind over and over again. Now that's one thing that most meditation practices don't teach. For instance, they teach the noting method, which is to note the unwholesome thoughts, but not remove them. Also, the choiceless awareness is to see those thoughts but have no choice about them. Remove them? They don't. But Bhikkhu Buddhadasa says right noble effort is the choice to change moment by moment, to see those unwholesome thoughts and to change them into wholesome thoughts. One after another after another, to change them to wholesome thoughts. And so once we start changing those unwholesome thoughts to wholesome thoughts, we begin also to gain confidence, or Saddha. And as we gain confidence that I can change my mind from unwholesome thoughts to wholesome thoughts, then we get this first kind of knowledge is that, "Yes, I can do this, no matter what happens, no matter how obstructed the mind gets, no matter what kind of pity party, no matter if I'm in jail, no matter if I'm in the hospital, no matter if I'm in the morgue, doesn't matter, I can come out of my hindrances." about whatever circumstances that I'm in and see the facts of life, see the reality. Now the Buddha says that this first knowledge is a step on the path. This is the actual first step. You've heard about Marga Phala, the step and then the fruit. The starting of it, and then the fruit of the path. All right, this is the first step on the path, is that knowledge that no matter what, I can come out of the hindrances and come back into a state where I'm in control. That's shraddha, and in fact, that's Samma Sanghappa. And the Buddha not only says that this is the first step on the path But he also says that this is noble, that this is supramundane, and that it is not held, this attitude of, "I can clean out my own mind, no matter what happens, no matter how obstructed it gets, no matter what kind of pity party, no matter how miserable or afraid or angry I become, I can come out of it." And he says that that attitude is not held, that knowledge is not held by ordinary people. Now what that means is about 99.9% of all of the people, which also means probably about half of the monks, maybe about half of the senior monks, and about 80% of New Mox, been less than 20 years. So ordinary people do not have the attitude. They have the loser's attitude of, "Oh, poor me, these hindrances have got me," rather than, "Oh no, I'm in charge now, I've got those hindrances under control." And so that's the Samma Sanghappa. That's that confidence, that Saddha, that I can be in charge of my own feelings. I can come out of my hindrances. I can come out of my bad feelings. I can come out of my fear. I can come out of my arrogance and come out of my humility too. And be a winner. And this is how one practices to become a lion. This is the first step becoming a lion. So what do you think?

**Speaker B:** Very well said.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** I said it's very well said.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's been said enough to where it's been well practiced.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I can't— nothing I disagree with there. I think that's all.

**Speaker A:** Well, if you do, you're disagreeing with the Buddha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's specifically. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But we don't practice that. Oftentimes we don't remember that we have to come out of our hindrances. We don't remember that we've got to stop all those unwholesome thoughts and start having wholesome thoughts. This is where the practice comes in. You've heard the statement that the teaching of the Buddha are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end. And yet most meditation practice is not good in the beginning. It gets really rotten. It goes into a dark night of the soul in the middle, and they never get to the end. But when you practice in the beginning to remove those hindrances, then in the middle When you've got that attitude, that middle attitude is the right noble attitude, that right noble Samma Sanghappa, that you've got this wired. You can practice the Eightfold Noble Path. You know, you have the knowledge and vision that this is the path, and you also have the knowledge and vision of what is not the path, which is ordinary life full of hindrances. And so you eradicate the doubt about the path. That's part of the middle practice, is the removal of the doubt, the fear, all of that. And then the end of the path is really good because there's nothing there. That's what makes it really good. Ain't nothing left. But that middle part, that's what we've got to get to, is that part where you've got that lion's attitude, not humble.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, I get it.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Ah, yeah, yeah, I see it.

**Speaker A:** So this is how we practice. We practice to see those thoughts by remembering to look And when we see those thoughts and we take the right noble attitude, or actually the right noble effort to remove them, and as we remove them over and over again is where that Samma Sanghappa, that wisdom comes in, the knowledge that it doesn't matter what happens. I see that far into the future, no matter what happens, I can handle it. Confidence. Good stuff. But it has to be practiced, because we've been practicing being a loser all of these years, been practicing being a victim. Every child is a victim to their parents. Parents say, pick up your toys, clean up your room. Do your homework, go to school. We're ordered around when we're children, and then when we're grown up, we have all of those rules in our brain that order us around. You no doubt have heard the Pali word silabata paramasa.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah. Well, that's what we're talking about here, is all the rules and all the supposed-tos that we picked up from childhood, and we go around our whole lives either conforming to the rules that we made up and keep inside, or we rebel against them. And when we conform, we're being a victim to the rules, and when we rebel against them, that's the arrogance. And the middle path is, let's throw those rules out. Let's get rid of that Samma Sanghappa— excuse me, the Asibha Bhavana Paramasa. Freud calls that the superego, and Arahant calls it the parent, the parent ego state. Neuroscientists, neurosurgeons, neurolinguistics will call that the temporal lobe or the mammalian brain. The language part of the mind. That language is almost always made up of rules, ideals. And when we can see that stuff in the mind, we can throw it out and put something wholesome in, like, I'm all right, I'm okay, I don't have to conform to my own set of rules in order to be okay, I'm already okay. Let me give you an example of that. You probably heard the rule: you should go to chanting. You should go. They have it at 4 AM and at 4 PM to 6 PM, depending upon the wat. Some wats have chanting, others don't. Some wats have chanting, but almost nobody goes. Except for visitors, etc., you should go to chanting. That's a rule. And the answer to that is, let's throw that rule out and say, I'm okay going to chanting or not going to chanting, I'm still okay. But if I am okay, then I can happily go to the chanting.

**Speaker B:** We lose a connection.

**Speaker A:** Pardon? You can happily go to the chanting because you're okay, as opposed to going to chanting because you're supposed to and not liking it and not okay. So often going to chanting is actually a hindrance for most. Question is, can you go to chanting and like it and enjoy it?


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points:

**Core Teaching:** The talk centers on the **first knowledge** or **first step on the Noble Path**, as described in the Kāmaṇḍakī Sutta (MN 48). This is the unshakable confidence (*saddhā*) that one can always emerge from the five hindrances (obstructions) and unwholesome mental states, no matter how difficult the circumstances.

**Main Practice - Right Effort:** The essential practice is **Right (or Righteous) Noble Effort**: actively recognizing unwholesome thoughts and hindrances as they arise, removing them, and deliberately replacing them with wholesome, "winner's" thoughts. This is contrasted with passive observation methods (like noting or choiceless awareness) that don't involve this active replacement.

**The "Lion's Attitude":** By repeatedly practicing this replacement, one develops **Sammā Saṅkappa (Right Intention/Resolve)**—a confident, "lion-like" attitude of being in charge of one's mind. This is **supramundane** and not held by ordinary people, who typically have a "loser's attitude" of being victimized by their hindrances.

**Path Structure:**
*   **Beginning:** Practice starts well by actively removing hindrances.
*   **Middle:** Developing the unwavering confidence and lion's attitude removes doubt and clarifies the path.
*   **End:** The fruit of the path is "really good" because "there's nothing left" (presumably referring to the end of suffering).

**Application - Rejecting Internal Rules:** The practice extends to identifying and discarding internalized rules and "shoulds" (*sīlabbata parāmāsa*), often formed in childhood (compared to Freud's superego). True freedom comes from realizing "I'm already okay" without conforming to these internal dictates, allowing one to act from a place of wholesome intention rather than compulsion or rebellion.

**Overall Message:** The Dhamma is a proactive training to gain mastery over the mind. By relentlessly applying Right Effort to cultivate wholesome states, one builds the supreme confidence that liberation from suffering is always possible, which is itself the first fruition of the path.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate the core teaching about overcoming mental hindrances and cultivating a "winner's" mindset. Here are the key ones:

### 1. **The Path and the Fruit (Marga Phala)**
   - **Metaphor:** The spiritual journey is described as a path with steps and fruits. The "first step" is gaining the knowledge that you can overcome hindrances; the "fruit" is the result of walking that path.
   - **Purpose:** To frame progress in meditation as a structured journey with clear milestones.

### 2. **Becoming a Lion**
   - **Metaphor:** Practicing the removal of unwholesome thoughts and hindrances is how one "becomes a lion."
   - **Purpose:** To contrast a confident, empowered, and fearless attitude (the lion) with a passive or victim mentality. The lion symbolizes sovereignty over one’s mind.

### 3. **The Loser vs. Winner Attitude**
   - **Story/Metaphor:** The speaker contrasts two attitudes:
     - **Loser/Victim:** "Oh, poor me, these hindrances have got me."
     - **Winner/Lion:** "I'm in charge now, I've got those hindrances under control."
   - **Purpose:** To emphasize that the practice is about shifting from a default state of helplessness to one of agency and confidence.

### 4. **The Dark Night of the Soul**
   - **Metaphor:** Referencing a common phrase in contemplative traditions to describe the difficult, disorienting middle phase of some meditation practices.
   - **Purpose:** To criticize approaches that don’t actively remove hindrances, suggesting they lead to unnecessary suffering and stagnation instead of progress.

### 5. **The Parent/Child Dynamic and Internal Rules**
   - **Story:** The speaker describes how everyone is conditioned in childhood by parental rules ("pick up your toys," "do your homework"). As adults, we internalize these as a set of internal "rules" or "supposed-tos."
   - **Related Metaphors:**
     - **Silabata Paramasa:** The Pali term for attachment to rules and rituals, used here to describe this internal rulebook.
     - **Freud's Superego / Transactional Analysis' "Parent Ego State":** Psychological parallels to the internalized rule-making voice.
     - **The Mammalian Brain / Temporal Lobe:** A neuroscientific metaphor for the part of the brain that houses this language-based, rule-generating function.
   - **Purpose:** To explain the origin of mental hindrances (like guilt, rebellion, or rigid thinking) and to argue that freedom comes from discarding these arbitrary internal rules.

### 6. **The Concrete Example: Going to Chanting**
   - **Story:** The speaker gives a specific, relatable example about the rule "you should go to chanting." They contrast two ways of attending:
     1. Going because you're "supposed to," which creates resistance and is a hindrance.
     2. Going from a place of being "already okay," which allows for enjoyment and genuine participation.
   - **Purpose:** To ground the abstract teaching in a practical, everyday monastic (or practice) scenario, showing how to apply the principle of replacing a "rule" with a "wholesome thought."

### 7. **The Pity Party**
   - **Metaphor:** A colloquial term for indulging in self-pity and negative emotions.
   - **Purpose:** To vividly and humorously describe a state of being overwhelmed by hindrances, which the practitioner learns they can "come out of."

### 8. **Cleaning the Mind**
   - **Metaphor:** The process of removing unwholesome thoughts and hindrances is likened to cleaning or clearing out clutter.
   - **Purpose:** To present mental purification as an active, repetitive, and necessary chore for clarity and peace.

### 9. **The Unobstructed vs. Obstructed Mind**
   - **Metaphor:** The mind is portrayed as something that can become "obstructed" or "hindered" like a blocked path or a dirty window.
   - **Purpose:** To visualize the goal: a clear mind that can "see things the way they actually are."

**In summary,** the speaker uses a blend of **traditional Buddhist imagery (path/fruit)**, **powerful animal symbolism (lion)**, **psychological stories (childhood rules)**, **modern spiritual metaphors (dark night of the soul)**, and **everyday vignettes (chanting)** to argue for an active, confident approach to meditation that replaces unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones, thereby building the "first knowledge" of unwavering self-efficacy.
