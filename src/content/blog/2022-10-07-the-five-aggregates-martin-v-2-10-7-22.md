### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right. All right. Yes, it's working now.

**Speaker B:** Perfect.

**Speaker A:** So tell me a little bit about the five aggregates.

**Speaker B:** Well, I mean, I don't know exactly what to say. So as I said, I watched quite a lot of your videos and basically talking about how the five aggregates are not the self, and there is no essence in the five aggregates. And to me, I find this especially helpful with thoughts, because it's quite easy to have like a thought pop up in your mind, and you take it seriously, and it brings you down. But then if you remember that you are not this thought, that in fact you can just stop this thought right in its tracks, and maybe instead think about nothing, or think about something good. To me, that's where the five aggregates are most helpful.

**Speaker A:** All right. It appears that the original teachings about the five aggregates were for students who were especially slow and reluctant to drop their conformational bias about deep dark past and long distant futures, because the people of the Buddha's time were more or less all eternalists and had been for probably about 300 years or so. That it looks like that rebirth and reincarnation, actually we can pinpoint a time of about 800 BC when the Rig Veda started to put put that stuff together, and that it was actually a political ploy or propaganda of how the Brahmins could control so that they could get money. In other words, if they can get the farmer to do an animal sacrifice, to kill a goat, after the goat is killed and blessed and blah, blah, blah, they get the goat.

**Speaker B:** Yes, exactly. But maybe one question I have about that is, why do you think then that it's so prominent in the story of the awakening of the Buddha? You know, like, the first thing he does is recollect his past life, then like see how beings die and then reappear in some other realms, and then.

**Speaker A:** He— There are two possibilities for that kind of stuff. Both of them more or less Hindu. And one of them is, is that to get people to put the Buddha way up high, to give him a magical birth, right? Just like all of the other deities in all the other religions, right? Yes, a magical birth is one of the ways to get really, really stupid ignorant people in line. And the other is to prove the existence of Kamma and rebirth. So one is putting the Buddha way up high because of his Kamma and rebirth, so those are the two issues that are there. In that early time that we were talking about, about 800 BC, it seems that the Brahmins were challenged. Why should the Brahmins, a big Brahmin family actually, why should the Brahmins be the only priests? Why should the Brahmins be doing all of the ceremonies, writing all of the magical language, and saying all the magical words to get all the magical property away from the stupid people? And their answer was, is that, oh well, it's that way because we were born Brahmins and you were not. You're just being jealous. It is obviously true that the Brahmins do all of these ceremonies and we sit back and do nothing. You know, we just let you guys come to us when you're in trouble and we get your goods for it. OK, so you could think of that. Brahmanism was actually the original psychotherapy. And so the next point is that we are born Brahmins because we were good in the past, and you were not born Brahmin, you were born as an ordinary person because you were not as good as us in your past. And that's the birth of that belief. It was an excuse for maintaining power. Oh, we're the Brahmins because we were born Brahmins, and you're not a Brahmin because you were not good enough to be born Brahmin because you had been a naughty boy in the past. And so this is where the whole idea of rebirth, or actually the word correctly here would be reincarnation. This is where reincarnation got started, in let us say concert or cahoots with the belief in Kamma. You do a good action, you'll get a good result; you do a bad action, you'll get a bad result. Now, in one of the sutras, the Buddha talks about in practice 117 in the Majjhima Nikaya, the Great Forty, is where he talks about wrong view. And this wrong view that he's talking about is basically a worldview. And there is a wrong worldview and a kind of an ordinary right view. And these can be broken down into a very simple statement of wrong view is I can do anything I want and get away with it. Yeah, this is the belief of every child. Especially those who have been nurtured too long and not held accountable, and they grow up with the whole idea that I can get away with it. In fact, the best example on planet Earth right now are the twins, Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. Yeah, yeah, they think that they could get away with it. Oh yeah, an ordinary right view is, "Oh no, you can't!" Or another way of saying it is, "Oh no, we can't!" But, "Oh no, you can't get away with it! We've got rules, you know! And the rule is, you do a good action, you get a good result, and if you do a bad action, you'll get a bad result." And the kids, they look around and they say, "No, sometimes I can get away with it." And in fact, good criminals do get away with it. They're smart enough to get away with it because, after all, the only people who become a cop are the people who have the confirmation bias that, oh no, you can't get away with it, but they're not particularly smart. So it depends upon your intelligence as to whether you get away with it or not. And it depends upon what the rule is. And other things like that. But a hard and fast rule has to have some magic in it. Oh no, you do a good action, you're bound to get someday a good result, and if you do a bad action, you're bound someday to get a bad result. That's why you're not born as a Brahman. And so that's the ordinary right view, is you can't get away with it. An ordinary wrong view is, I can get away with it. I can do anything I want, I can hurt as many people as I want, and I won't suffer any consequences. Yeah, right. Okay, both of those are actually dukkha-laden. The kid who thinks he could get away with it because he did one time will now do it in a stupid way and will get caught. Or the thief that is capable of getting away with it, he winds up not enjoying the life, but in fact, he's being hunted down. Brewster's got his millions, what is he going to do with it? He's got to hide it. He hadn't gotten caught yet. So, both ordinary right view and ordinary wrong view is unsatisfying. But the idea is that in the ordinary right view, the way I talk about it is, is that, "Oh no, you can't get away with it, we're going to hire the cops!" "Oh no, you can't get away with it, we're going to have teachers and Aunts and uncles and mommy and daddy are going to stand there and watch you. And if that's not enough, we're going to hire a priest and a preacher. They're going to buy— they're going to get a magic camera that's going to watch you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so this is the whole idea that it becomes eternalist. Eternalism means that over and over and over again, you still have actions that still need results. And it keeps going that way, on and on and on and on and on. Is there a way out of that on and on and on and on? And when they say yes, finally, after so many lives of doing good things and getting enough good results, eventually I'll have enough merit that I can be born like the Buddha too, or maybe not even at all. Right. That's what we mean by semi-eternalism. But you got to put in lives and lives and lives of a whole lot of effort. Yeah, why is that? Oh, it's because you also have to pay the Brahmins. That's how you make good merit, is by building big temples. That's why India is so full of big temples. Because people were believing what the Brahmins told them, and so that got set into the mindset of all of the people in the time of the Buddha. And so there are several teachings. Now it's not so hard. I can basically talk someone out of their eternalism beliefs in about an hour, but I also have a lot of people that can get really angry and post really mean comments without ever bothering to listen to what's being said. It's just so against their confirmation bias. Yes, rebirth and reincarnation.

**Speaker B:** I think most Buddhists would be shocked.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** I think that most Buddhists would be shocked by the statement that there is no rebirth.

**Speaker A:** Well, I mean, I don't go so far. Let's clean that up. I don't say that there is no rebirth, but I would say that it's a pretty ridiculous idea. Yeah, but I don't know for sure.

**Speaker B:** I don't know exactly.

**Speaker A:** No one knows for sure. The next point about it being ridiculous is because what evidence do you have?

**Speaker B:** Not a lot.

**Speaker A:** Not a lot, only some children telling stories that they were told to tell.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, that's the best. Yes, the best proof they have is children, like a few hand-picked children remembering what happened in the past life.

**Speaker A:** But what are they remembering? Are they remembering something that they weren't told? Did they dream it up on their own, or did they get coached into it?

**Speaker B:** It's hard to say.

**Speaker A:** Have you ever heard of the name Madeleine Albright?

**Speaker B:** No, never.

**Speaker A:** During the '90s, she was the Attorney General under Clinton. And so, what happened before that, she was in Miami, Florida. And big, big news came out about what she was doing in the 1970s when she was the Attorney General there in Miami. And what had happened was, is that several adult women in their 20s got somehow to know each other and started putting together that the memories that they had about being raped were not real memories. It didn't really happen. They just went along because they were told to, because Madeleine Albright wanted to really crack down on child pornography. And so the social workers would start questioning little girls and getting them convinced to tell these stories that put uncles, grandfathers, and other people in prison for no reason at all other than the confirmation bias. And then that started coming out in the 1990s. Okay, how close is that to memories of reincarnation? Yeah, because these girls were 13, 12, that age when this was supposed to happen, or that was the age they were when they were convinced to turn Uncle Bob in. So that's what a confirmation bias is, is that we are convinced that things are true without any evidence at all other than hearsay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that's all you've got for reincarnation or rebirth is hearsay.

**Speaker B:** And what would you say to the argument that maybe it's like a motivation to practice? Because if you think, okay, like in a few years I'll be my coffin.

**Speaker A:** It's a motivation to not practice.

**Speaker B:** You think so? Oh, because you can practice later.

**Speaker A:** Because I can practice later, I got all the time in the world.

**Speaker B:** But what about the idea that you know, like our time on this earth is not so long, pretty soon I'll be in my coffin, and then it should be like the traditional Nibbana, because when you take the belief in rebirth, what is the goal? The goal is to escape.

**Speaker A:** How far do you want to go? Are you going to be ultra-orthodox or just orthodox? Because you're right, it's the orthodox, but ultra-orthodox, no, in the time of the Buddha, The word Nibbana meant nothing but cool. Yes, using two examples. One is when an animal becomes domesticated, then they're chill. Another one was when food comes right out of the fire, it's too hot to eat. You need to let it— Nibbana. The same thing is with the mind. Get the heat out of the mind and let it chill. Let it cool off. That's what Nibbana meant in the time of the Buddha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But most people can only see that that's going to happen to them after they're in the moldy grave. Then they will chill. That's the Jhana. That's the highest peace.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. But the thing is, like, if there is no rebirth, then you will get that highest peace no matter what you do. You can like practice now.

**Speaker A:** I'm not asking you to get it before the rebirth. You're going back to there is no rebirth. Let's make sure that you don't know.

**Speaker B:** I don't know, of course I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I have an open mind. Not only that, but let's stay with the point that it is irrelevant because it doesn't have anything to do with how you live your life now.

**Speaker B:** Exactly, no, I'm playing devil's advocate, this is not really my opinion.

**Speaker A:** I know, I know, but I appreciate it. Here comes the devil, I'm coming for you. The double of reality.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I know because I've listened to your videos, I've read Buddhadasa's books, and I know that the answer is right now, it's the practice right now. I'm not interested in that anymore, it doesn't matter to me. But I know unfortunately that there are so many people, because I've read these things online, that make these points like.

**Speaker A:** "Oh, what's the point?".

**Speaker B:** And it's hard I think to reach these people. Whereas I know for a fact that you can experience Nibbana.

**Speaker A:** I'm not even trying to. I don't reach at all. I'm tired of it. Okay? I'm tired of grabbing and reaching and whatnot like that. If someone reaches out to me because they want to hear the Dhamma, then I'll respond.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I'm a little slippery, but I'll respond.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Uh, and, and so we're making kind of sure, uh, in this place right now is that it is irrelevant because we don't know. No, anything that you don't know is irrelevant until you do know it, and then it becomes relevant.

**Speaker B:** But what we do know is that what the Buddha said to Sati, you know, in that sutta, that consciousness is dependently arisen. That is something you can experience. Yeah, I mean, that's— I mean, this is something you can experience. And so this can dispel the notion that there is this consciousness that's like even in this life, there is no such thing. So why would you think about past life and next life when in this moment there is not the same?

**Speaker A:** Wait a minute. What the Buddha teaches is that consciousness, whichever definition that we have of it, and I've got two solid uses of the word consciousness, and also in Pali the word Vinaya, is used, and it's used exactly the same two ways. And so we'll talk about that for a moment later. However, the important point is, no matter which of the two kinds of consciousness it is, they're dependently arising. Yes, in this— in that sutra, the consciousness is when you see it, when a sight that is a physical object with light, gets to the eye, and it contacts the eye, then the eye becomes conscious of that sight. But if there is no eye, if there is no sight to be seen, if there is only full darkness, then there is nothing to be conscious of. So consciousness, eye consciousness, doesn't exist. The same thing is with sound. That unless you hear something, the hearing is actually the contact of the sound waves themselves contacting the ear, making hair move in a liquid, and that's connected to the neurons that go into the brain. So, if there is no sound, then there is no consciousness of a sound. That's what the word is all about. So it's always dependently arising. That sutta is what gave many people the idea, who still want to cling to rebirth, reincarnation, sorry. The difference between rebirth and reincarnation is that it's consciousness that is reborn in reincarnation, and in rebirth, that is believed by many Buddhists there is no consciousness to be reborn. Well, if it's not me that's being reborn, then why should I give a flying rip about rebirth? You can see how selfish the whole point is. Oh, it's not that— does rebirth or not rebirth exist or not? It is me who is being reborn. Yeah. Or not. Okay. And one of the reasons why the belief is so delicious, it is so widespread, and in fact we have really solid evidence with another religion which I'll get to, but people are afraid to die, they don't want to die, they see their friends die, they don't know what to do with it. Imagine what it was like way back in really primitive times when humans became conscious. You see, a dog will walk by his best friend's dog dead, and they won't do much pining. They'll do some sniffing and then they'll walk away. Dogs don't bury dogs. No, not in great ceremony. They don't have any ceremony at all. Why? Because that's not part of their fear package. Their fear of dying is right here, right now. If the wolf comes, the dog's going to be afraid. But seeing a dead dog there, the dog is not going to necessarily be afraid. It's going to sniff it and see if he can eat it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So humans are different because when we see a dead human, we think immediately of me dying. Yeah. That's why funerals have become such a big moneymaker. Oh, that we make a lot of money, and we have been making a whole lot of money a whole long time. Time, all the way back to the time of the Buddha. In fact, at that time, the reasons why the Brahmins were so rich is because they owned all the land, because they required that as payment for a proper funeral. Guess what? They still do that at Varanasi. I've been to those funerals. Wow. They want land, lots of land.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So, it's a scam, it's a trap. People are afraid to die. This is part of the reason why the Buddha teaches to become fearless. If you're not afraid of death, then you don't have to have any beliefs much about it, because you really don't know, and you can stay neutral, because we really don't know anything. Except for one thing we do know, and that is, since there is absolutely no evidence of an afterlife, why should we give a flying rip? Yeah, why not go with the evidence that there is none? Because we got a whole lot of evidence that there is none. Houdini set up a whole lot of evidence back in, from about the 1840s until the 1930s, in about a 90-year— actually more than 90, maybe 100-year period of time. Seances were very popular. Do you know what a seance is?

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, yeah, no, I know. Yeah, you have to contact the dead, right?

**Speaker A:** Right. Guess what? How many seances, real ones, do you have anymore?

**Speaker B:** Uh, not many. Like some kids, kids.

**Speaker A:** Why were they— they even had them in the White House.

**Speaker B:** Really?

**Speaker A:** Wow. Yeah, Lincoln had, because he had— he lost a son. So let's have a séance, okay? Houdini, who was a master magician, sleight of hand magic, could take handcuffs off, could take the chain around his neck and get it up on his chin, and then get it up on his forehead, and then you get it behind, which meant now all the chains fall right off of him, okay? He did underwater tricks and all kinds of things, and so he knew the art of prestidigitation very well. But he was also very much like myself, really curious about what real magic was real. And so he started going to séances, and every one of them he exposed. Big newspaper headlines and all of that kind of stuff there. I don't remember their names, but there were two sisters who were very good at it, and he finally caught them. When he recognized that when one of the women got up and walked around in the room that he saw her in, she was barefoot. But when she sat back down, she put her shoes back on. That's pretty strange, isn't it? Did you catch that?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Most people, they go barefoot when they're sitting and they'll put their shoes on when they get up to walk around. But this woman was different. What was happening was, is that the right shoe was connected under the floor.

**Speaker B:** Wow.

**Speaker A:** And so she could lift her feet up and move the wires back and forth to create all kinds of things in the room. Okay. And because that stuff was exposed in the 1930s and people were put in jail and that kind of stuff, because they were making a lot of money off of it, it just stopped. Yeah, we don't see any of them anymore. No, they got caught at it. Maybe, maybe evangelical Christian preachers are going to get caught at it too, all in a group. But mostly they just get caught one at a time with either their hands in the panties or in the plate.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So let's go now and talk about the five aggregates. Yes, because anyone who sits down and begins to answer questions correctly and look at things can say for sure that who I really am is not the body. No, no, definitely, because at 3 years old I was different than I was at 9, and when I was at 21, and when I was at 35, and when I was at 50, and when I was at 35 is all different. So the body cannot be. And now they know for sure that all of the molecules are basically— the first way is all of the cells that are in your body now will all be dead and replaced in the next 7 years. They didn't used to think that. They used to think that a child, by the time of 5, his mind was already set. No, those neurons live and die. Nothing is set. We just keep training the neurons to act the way that the old ones were operating. That was what's going on. So there's not one cell in your body that's more than about 7 years old. You're completely changed. Everything about you, all your cells are dead, all of the molecules. A lot of the water that you piss out is not drank. Is manufactured in the process of combining the food and getting the carbon out of it and forming water with oxygen, and out you go with it. Okay, so there's a whole lot of stuff in the body that's not you at all. And so that's one of the trainings, is to recognize that you are not the body. But look how many industries are built on the belief that people have, the conformational bias. I am the body. It sneaks up, it's easy.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, it's big money.

**Speaker A:** The fashion industry, the lipstick and cosmetic industry, the perfume industry, Gucci, Prada— it's all vanity. It's all about I, me, and mine. Even clothing determines who you are. In fact, there's a concept called the clothes make the man. It's not as important as it was many, many years ago, but everybody had to dress the same in the old days. So if you're a businessman, you better dress like a businessman. Now that's not so much. Elon Musk will break that rule. Yeah, there's another one. Um, Vladimir, uh, uh, Putin, he wears a coat and tie, all straightened up. How does Vladimir Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, dress? No, that's right, casually in an army green t-shirt. He's not fitting the role. Right? He's not dressed like all of the other politicians. The same thing is true of the guy who's running for Senator in Pennsylvania; he doesn't wear the traditional suit. There's the whole idea about the clothes make the man is beginning finally to fall apart. But the clothes make the man actually is, I am the clothes I wear.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they define me.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, they define who I am. It defines the body. Let's look at some more industries. How about the sports industry?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And how about the workout industry and fitness centers all over? I am the body. It is me who is running on this treadmill.

**Speaker B:** Exactly, and my body has to be fit, because then I will look good.

**Speaker A:** Right, so I will look good so that I will be a chick magnet, exactly. Or better still, I will look good because I was told to look good. That's expected of me, there's the rules. And in fact, a lot of the rules that we have reinforce our confirmation of bias about "I am the body." And if people can understand that one, that's the thread that is pulled. When people recognize, "No, I'm not the body, I'm something else." Well, let's go a little bit deeper into it. Are you the feelings? Sometimes anger, sometimes sadness. And when they— and in our society we say, I am sad, I am angry, I am frustrated, but it's not me that's frustrated. It's just there is frustration. At best, I am the one who sees the frustration. I'm the observer here. Yeah, but there's a little bit further that we can look at it, and that is that no self is necessary. Just observation. We can have observation without an observer, just like we can have walking without a walker. You've heard that one?

**Speaker B:** Yes, from Nagarjuna.

**Speaker A:** Yes. All right, so I am the observer is, for most people, kind of the intermediate point, which would say then that rebirth is the intermediate point between reincarnation and not giving a flip. Yes, just don't care. And that's where a lot of people get mixed up, because they think that, oh, if I believe in reincarnation and you laugh at me, that means you believe that reincarnation doesn't exist. But nobody really knows. No, nobody knows. But what we do know is whatever it is that is reborn, it is not the body. That's what— that's where a lot of people— in fact, that's the whole Muslim religion is founded upon that. That's why they love to cut up bodies and send the penis in that direction and the arms and legs and whatnot like that, because they have the The belief is that the body is going to heaven. I really am the body. That's part and parcel of Islam. Yeah, they have a lot of rules and rituals about it. The body's got to be buried within 24 hours of death. Actually, they have it on the same day. It's got to be buried the same day unless it's at night, and then he's born— buried the next morning. Got to do it, otherwise that body is not going to get to the right destination. You can't leave them out on the slab like they do in the morgue. You got to bury the darn thing, okay? Otherwise it won't get to its proper destination. So there's a lot of beliefs about the body. We grew up in a society that believes in 'I am the body' and supports industries like the clothing industry, the medical profession, the sports industries, the Cosmetics and all of that is just built into our society, and we as children are not wise enough to look up and say, "Mommy, why do you put that lipstick on? It's expensive and you don't look any different.".

**Speaker B:** "Oh, you look worse.".

**Speaker A:** "You look worse with that. Not only that, but you get it all over my arm when you kiss me." We go then to the feelings: I am not my feelings, I am not the anger. The anger is there, but it's not me. No one is going to be permanently angry all the time, and yet the whole idea of a soul is something that's the essence, permanent, everlasting, it endures. Then in fact, that's one of the problems of Buddhism being translated into English, is that it would have been more correct for for it to say "no soul," because that's more correct. In the sense that we can define soul, we can't define self very much. I mean, self-driving, the car now has a self. We can give it a name, a Tesla. It's got self-driving, all kinds of words, all kinds of uses for the word "self," so we can't say that there is no such thing. One way or the other. What we can say though, is that there is selfishness; we can see it in ourselves sometimes, and see it in others often. So, there is such a thing as selfishness, but inherent existence is subject to investigation. So, Nagarjuna uses the example of a chariot. But we could use the example of a motorbike or a PC or a chair or anything. So Nargajuna asked permission of the king, can I, let us say, order your people around to rearrange this? And so he said, take the wheels off and put them over there. Actually take the spokes out and the hub out. Take the basket apart, take the ridgepole and throw it over that way. Where's the chariot? The king has to recognize the chariot's in his mind. Yeah, chariot doesn't actually exist until the parts of it are rearranged into his mental concept of what a chariot is. Okay, that there is no such thing inherent as chariot. It's just a mental concept that's been manufactured. Same thing with an automobile. There's no such thing inherently as an automobile. It's made up of parts. Same thing with the body. There's no— where, if there is a soul, where is it? Is it at the tip of your nose? Is it on the third eye? Is it between your bowel movement place and the other place? Where is it? Is it on the left scrotum or the right scrotum? How about the toenails? Who is the self? Where is me? And when the feelings come and go and come and go and come and go, where am I? Am I moving? No, you're a soul. You're supposed to stay put. I mean, what is it that can survive death? It's so powerful to survive death, but it's not powerful enough to handle the feeling.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's true. So yeah, there's nothing much to the soul, but the word is misconstrued. I think that in fact, to be honest with you, I think it was intentionally mistranslated because these were Christians.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** You can't go around saying there's no soul. That's dead set against Christianity.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think so, because when you look at the first sutta, when the Buddha talks about it, it's quite clear that he's talking about a soul. Like, it's like everlasting, the essence that you can control it and everything. It's not like this, like, everyday mundane self word that we use in everyday language.

**Speaker A:** Have you ever heard of the name Mahatma Gandhi?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, break it apart and you'll see Maha. Yeah, Maha Atta, that soul. So Anatta is not a soul, which means nothing is permanent. The Buddha taught everything is temporary, Anicca, what to— Sankhara. Tathagata, why you're dominant, etc. The whole point is, is that we have a confirmation bias that I am who I am and that's all I am. You know, every one of us sings the Popeye the Sailor Man song, I am. And the reality is, is that no, you're just a bunch of constituent parts that happen to be put together in a a particular configuration right now, and that configuration is going to be changing very quickly over a short period of time. And it can change in the direction that you want it to change if you're aware that you can change and you're aware that this is the time to change. Otherwise, we have the belief that there is a soul So, if consciousness is dependently arisen, if the body for sure is not a soul, if our feelings are all over the place and they're not a soul, then the next two things would be perception and memory. But you're not who your memories are, you don't just remember and there you are, or you were always there, all you have to do is remember. That you're there, because our memories are spotty. They're not very good. We don't take information in well, we don't organize it well, and we don't put it back out very well. That's the problem, is that our memories are really shoddy. A good example, by the way, is a movie. It's either on film or on your hard drive, a video. Guess what? Your computer knows that video, that movie, much better than you do. You don't remember all the dialogue, you don't remember all of the music, you can't play any of that music, you don't even remember it frame by frame.

**Speaker B:** I don't even remember the characters' names.

**Speaker A:** Yes, and all of that, computer can memory. So, the computer memory is much better than human. But we don't think of the memory of the computer as a self. No, because we could wipe all that whole file out and 10,000 other files and put new files on. We got— I mean, you can take Windows off and put Linux on, so there's no inherent self as far as software. And not only that, but if the hard drive goes bad, you can change that. You can change out the memory and put in a new processor. You can change the screen. You can change the keyboard. There's nothing on a laptop and then.

**Speaker B:** Pretty soon you have a new PC. I mean, this is how it is with my PC because I built it myself, and like over the last 6-7 years I've changed this and that, and it's like 100% of the PC is different. But there was no point where it was a completely different PC. It's just changed slowly over the last 6-7 years to the point where nothing is the same as when I bought it the first time.

**Speaker A:** You remind me of the story of my grandfather's hand axe. A hatchet. Okay, he's had that same hatchet almost all his life. He got it in his 20s and he's in his 80s and it's the same hatchet. But he does remember that he broke the handle a couple of times and then he broke the head. He used the new handle to put on the new head and it's still the same hand axe. Yeah, yeah, that's the way that we think about things, is that we see a connection that doesn't really exist. Until we investigate. So, when we investigate our memories, we can figure out that they're putrid, shoddy, and not only that, but we tend to remember the wrong things. It would be much better to remember the right thing at the right time, rather than remembering the wrong thing. An example of that would be a mother fussing at her child, yakety, yakety, yakety, yak, and the child is in tears, and mother gets even more angry, and the child child is even more afraid. Walk up to that lady and ask her, would you treat a policeman this way? What would a policeman behave like if you talk to him the way you're talking to your daughter?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, she wouldn't.

**Speaker A:** No, because she has at that level a little fear and situational awareness. But she doesn't have that situational awareness. She's not thinking, she's not looking, she's just lost her mind because of she feels safe, she can get away with treating her daughter that way. But then when she's in front of the cop, she recognizes very quickly she's not going to be able to get away with it. All right, so the memories that we have are dependently arising also. And one of the ways that I teach is that in the present moment, starting now, starting with correct practice, we begin to add new wholesome memories on top of the old pile of old memories. So that when a situation comes up, we're more likely to deal with it with the new data than with the really, really ancient data. If we're doing that. But if we keep stirring our old pot, all this is all me in there, then you're more than likely going to take up a memory that happened when you were 2 or 3 years old because they were really powerful back then. You didn't have so many. Rather than taking a new wholesome memory off the top of the deck.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you have to recognize the bad old memory and just stop reenacting it in your mind. Like as soon as you notice it, you have to like let go. It's not self, it's not me, it's not my soul. Out you go, and then actually I'm good.

**Speaker A:** This is not who I am. I can make a change right now if I can remember to think that way.

**Speaker B:** You just need the small effort. It's like a small dose of effort to get rid of it and replace it with something wholesome. And if you do, then you feel you're good for however long it can last.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, I must mention then about part of the Eightfold Noble Path is Right Noble Effort. Right Noble Effort is the very least amount of effort necessary to actually get the job done. Sometimes just a little nudge is all it takes. The example that I'm thinking about is the police car is chasing this dude down the highway, and all of the police in town are all in a fritter about it, they've even got a helicopter or something out there, and all the policeman has to do is to come up to the back of that other car that he's trying to chase and nudge it. Just give it a little nudge, and that guy's going to be spinning all over the road. That's the way that we need to think about the right effort, is just a nudge in the right place at the right time to change the mind out of an unwholesome pattern into a wholesome pattern, which basically means it spins around and stops. Yeah, okay. So, uh, in, in that way, we're recognizing that we're not our memory system. So the last one on the list then is the fifth aggregate, is perception. Now, uh, perception actually means, if you look at the word to perceive or to precognize or even to recognize or to recognize something. In other words, we make an understanding out of what we see, that we get curious sometimes of what's going on over there, and we try to put it together with what we know to figure out what's happening. When we do figure out what's happening, that's a new kind of consciousness. But it too is dependently arising, now it's depending upon perception, and it's depending upon the original thing that we saw, consciousness, that was also dependently arising. If we shut our eyes, we wouldn't see it, and then we wouldn't be asking questions about it. So now we're digging into our memory and looking and finding out, and then to put that together to figure out what's happening. That is what we mean by perception; we're trying to understand what we're taking in as input. And so the input then is not what contacts us, it's what we've made of that input. We perceive that input using old data, even if that data is only 5 or 10 or 15 seconds old. That's how we know trajectories, is because we're watching it right now as it moves along right now, we can see exactly where it's heading. So sometimes if we're using recent past, our perception is pretty sharp. If we're using really, really old data, then our trajectories and our perception of how things are headed are going to get off. And so this new kind of consciousness in the Pali is called the Salyatana. The perception is called Anamarupa and also Sanyata, and the memory systems are called Samskara. You've heard that word before, I'm sure, the Samskara. All that old stuff, including some of it is fairly new, and the newer it is, the better it is to use in perception. So that we come up with something that's quite accurate, because it's really close. The output of perception, the 'saleh-attana'— the word, by the way, 'saleh' means 'to be inside,' and 'attana' means 'the senses,' the inner senses. And that's what contacts us, and that's what gives rise to feelings. Because the feelings are already mixed in with the Samskaras. In other words, we feel this time the way we remember that we felt last time this kind of event happened. So, if you hear a loud noise as a child and you always duck, and then every time you hear a loud noise you duck, then when you're an adult and everything happens, now a brand new noise is happening and we duck, because we're in the habit of ducking. Why? Because we're afraid. Yeah, but if we start listening very closely to what's going on, we can recognize, oh well, I don't need to duck now. That noise is loud but it's far away. It missed me. I don't have to duck.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, so this is how these five aggregates are taught, as in the sense of there is no self there. There's no self in our memory. There's no self in the way that the human mind processes data to come up with an answer. The answer that we come up with is closer and closer now to a self, but the five aggregates themselves, there's no self there. It's just sight and processing and coming up with a solution based upon our past. But the past is malleable, not fixed, no soul to it. No, our perception is not fixed. Sometimes we feel like a nut, sometimes we don't, sometimes we're all over the place, sometimes we're confused, sometimes we're spot on. Our perception is malleable, it's also dependently arising. No self, no soul, no essence of me is there anywhere. And when people begin to hear that, then they can stop clinging to the concept that there really is a me in here someplace that will survive death. Started recognizing that no, whatever me is is going to be dead long before the body dies. An example of that is Alzheimer's. Alzheimer's changes the personality completely.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, I know.

**Speaker A:** They even forget language and vocabulary and all kinds of stuff.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, my grandmother died from Alzheimer's, so.

**Speaker A:** They've been doing it, by the way, for a long time. The word Alzheimer's is a new word for an old problem. They called it dementia, they called it senility, they called it crazy old age. Yeah, so we changed the words for it as medical science wants to get their hands on it more and more, make some money off of it. We got to change the name of it. It's a new product now. But the point is, is that the person that was 15 is not the same person as 25, nor the same person at 45 or 75 or 95, that we go through changes. The personality changes. People stop being a Christian and start being an atheist, and they stop being an atheist and become a Hindu, and then they stop being a Hindu and start being a Buddhist, and then they, if they're lucky, stop being.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And so this is why the Five Aggregates are taught the way that they are, is to work people through the understanding that what I thought of was me does not exist. Whatever me is, is dependently arising.

**Speaker B:** Yes, and I find that especially helpful if you have unwholesome thoughts, then if you know that, you can really easily let go, because you recognize the unwholesome thought, it's not you, it's not your essence, and you just stop doing that, and you do something else that's wholesome, positive.

**Speaker A:** It's wholesome, right? You make that effort to make that change.

**Speaker B:** Because if you believe that you are these unwholesome thoughts, then you don't want to let go. Like, no, but I can't, these are my unwholesome thoughts. They are who I am. No, but like— In fact, we start.

**Speaker A:** Arguing, they are not unwholesome, these are my thoughts.

**Speaker B:** I need them, yeah.

**Speaker A:** I need them, right? Because who would I be if I didn't think this way?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly. But if you know that your essence is not to be found in any of these aggregates, then it's a lot easier to let go.

**Speaker A:** There's no essence in fact anywhere, that we're always a moving target.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And but where, which way we move is based upon causes and effect. Many of them could be habits, old sad cars that keep running us in the same circle. Those sad cars are not me. Otherwise I behave the way that I used to behave. Until I'm nudged. But nobody's going to give a nudge to my mind except me. But when I nudge my mind, and I'm not the same me as I was before, I've changed.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly. I think it's very helpful as well to realize that you are not your memories, because that means you can change from one day to the next if you want to, because you're not bound by your old way of doing things. Like literally, this is not me. Like it's gone, it's in the past. Now I'm acting this way and I'm reacting.

**Speaker A:** Visual image that I've given students before, and that is imagine that your old past is like what we flush down the toilet. Anagami, Anapanasati, Bhikkhuni, Bhikkhu.

**Speaker B:** I'm losing you, Dhammarato. Can you hear me? Because you froze and I could not hear you anymore.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's because a bang happened in our neighborhood and the power is now out, but went out, but the power is back on now.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Yeah, it looks like it's still recording.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, it's still recording. Recording, uh, because this laptop is on battery. Oh, there it is. Okay, so let's come back. I was going to turn the Wi-Fi on. All right, so where we're going with this is the five aggregates are, uh, an introduction into Paticcasamuppada. There are several Suttas, one of the better ones is Sutta 22, the simile of the snake. The last half of that Sutta is about the five aggregates not being the self. And so, when people begin to understand that their old ideas of what it was, a soul, needs to be revisited, now they're capable of beginning to practice the teachings of the Buddha. But so long as we hold the confirmation bias of "I am who I am," and subject to the Kamma machine that has a long, slow process, and recognize that I can make some changes right now, because I'm not that permanent self. Yeah, and so in a way, the, uh, the belief in reincarnation and rebirth is the biggest fetter, the number one fetter that people have for practicing correctly. Personality view— who am I?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** That's the whole thing. And if people— and so I would go so far as to say is that This then becomes the introduction into the teachings of the Buddha, is to recognize that you are not set, you are not permanent, that you can change. If you don't get that and have the belief that, "Oh, I'm a soul, I'm permanent, I'll be reborn," and this and that, then there is no effort to practice correctly. No right noble effort. We postpone it, or we don't make the changes that we need to make. That's what really the whole thing is, is about the change, is are we willing to take the right noble effort? And if we believe in a soul, then we're not willing to take the right noble effort. It's the number one fetter. If we can't get over that, then that means that we're stuck in 'I can't change.' And the Eightfold Noble Path is about taking the right effort to change the unwholesome thoughts into wholesome thoughts, to change our attitude, to change our feelings, to change the way that we think. That's one's right effort applied to the mind applied to the feelings, applied to the body. We actually have to take the right effort to change the way that we breathe. We have to change our relationship to the body, to start paying attention to what the body is doing right now, rather than identifying that, "Oh, I am the body, I am always the same thing, therefore I don't have to worry about the body." That way, when something does happen to the body, "Oh, I've got to go to the doctor." I got to go get help rather than just sitting here and watching the poor body rot, because that's what it's going to do, is going to sit there and rot, because it's not permanent. Everything changes. So let's finish this talk with this point of is that we are now fully prepared to talk about Paticcasamuppada, especially in relationship to where does the self come from, why is there so much Dukkha involved with it, because we have it now nailed down firmly that you can change.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I can change, I've been changing, so I can change.

**Speaker A:** I am change, I'm change itself, and there I go. Whoopie, come back again. Nothing permanent here. Yeah, nothing abides. Everything is temporary. And so I use the phrase, sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't. Yeah, definitely. And so let's start watching those changes that happen because of the Samskara and decide that we can make changes newly. We can make new changes.

**Speaker B:** All right, yeah, nice. Well, thank you very much. So I'll call you back to talk about Paticcasamuppada then. Yes, thank you very much for this conversation, and I'll get back to you soon then. All right, thank you, Dhammarato. Have a good day. Goodbye.

**Speaker A:** We'll see you. Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a Sangha friend (Speaker B), centers on a radical reinterpretation of core Buddhist concepts, challenging orthodox beliefs to focus on immediate, practical insight. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: Deconstructing Eternalism to Empower Present-Moment Practice**
The talk argues that beliefs in **rebirth/reincarnation and an eternal soul (atta)** are not the essence of the Buddha's teaching but are cultural baggage and "confirmation bias" inherited from pre-Buddhist Brahmanical society. Dhammarato posits that these beliefs were often used for social control (e.g., Brahmins justifying their status) and can actually **hinder practice** by promoting complacency ("I can practice in a future life").

### **Main Arguments and Discussions**

1.  **The Five Aggregates (Khandhas) as a Practical Tool:**
    *   The primary purpose of analyzing the aggregates is to realize **"not-self" (anatta)**. This is most immediately useful for mental training.
    *   **Example:** Seeing a troubling thought as just a temporary mental formation (one of the aggregates) allows you to let it go and replace it with a wholesome thought. You are not defined by your thoughts.

2.  **A Historical Critique of Rebirth & Kamma:**
    *   Rebirth doctrines are traced to post-800 BCE Brahmanism, framed as a political tool to maintain priestly power and wealth (e.g., through animal sacrifices and funeral rites).
    *   The "magical" stories of the Buddha's past lives are likened to the myth-making found in other religions to elevate a figure's status.
    *   **Evidence for rebirth is dismissed** as hearsay, akin to coached childhood memories or debunked séances.

3.  **The Central Problem: Clinging to a Self ("I am"):**
    *   The belief in a permanent self is identified as the **#1 fetter** to practice. If you believe you are a fixed soul, you lack the urgency and belief in your ability to change *now*.
    *   **"I am the body"** is a pervasive confirmation bias fueling industries (fashion, cosmetics, fitness) and suffering.
    *   The teaching of **dependent origination (Paticcasamuppada)** applies to consciousness and all aggregates: they arise based on conditions, not from a permanent self.

4.  **A Pragmatic and Evidence-Based Approach:**
    *   The position on rebirth is **agnostic**: "Nobody knows for sure." Therefore, it is **irrelevant** to the practice, which is about what you can know and change in the present.
    *   **What we *can* know and experience** is that consciousness is dependently arisen, the aggregates are not-self, and we can observe and change our mental habits.
    *   **Nibbana is redefined** not as a post-mortem escape from the cycle of rebirth, but as the **cooling of the mind** here and now—like letting hot food cool to be edible.

5.  **The Path Forward: Right Effort and Change**
    *   Understanding *anatta* through the aggregates empowers **Right Effort**. You see you can "nudge" your mind from unwholesome to wholesome states because there is no fixed self to defend.
    *   **You are not your memories or personality.** You have been changing all your life and can consciously change direction now by creating new, wholesome mental patterns.
    *   This understanding is the essential **prerequisite for deeply understanding Dependent Origination**, which explains how suffering (dukkha) and the sense of self arise moment to moment from conditions.

### **Conclusion**
The talk is a forceful call to strip away metaphysical beliefs deemed cultural and obstructive, and to embrace the Buddha's teachings as a **practical, immediate psychotherapy**. The goal is to become fearless of death by ending suffering in the present, through direct insight into not-self and the dependent nature of all experience. The ultimate point is **liberating agency**: realizing you are not bound by a fixed self or destiny, so you can—and must—make the effort to change right now.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors, analogies, and stories** to explain complex Buddhist concepts and critique traditional beliefs. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Metaphors & Analogies**

1. **The Chariot (or PC/Motorcycle)**
   - **Source:** Referenced from Nagarjuna.
   - **Purpose:** To illustrate "no-self" (anatta) and the lack of inherent existence. Just as a chariot (or a self-built PC) is only a label for a collection of parts, the "self" is only a temporary assembly of the five aggregates.

2. **Grandfather’s Hand Axe / Hatchet**
   - **Story:** The axe had its handle replaced multiple times and its head replaced, yet it’s still considered "the same axe."
   - **Purpose:** To show how we impute continuity and identity onto things that are constantly changing—just like the "self."

3. **Nibbana as "Cooling Down"**
   - **Metaphor:** Likened to food cooling after being cooked, or an animal becoming domesticated and calm.
   - **Purpose:** To explain Nibbana not as a metaphysical afterlife but as a present-moment calming of the mind.

4. **Right Effort as a "Nudge"**
   - **Analogy:** A police car giving a slight nudge to a fleeing car, causing it to spin out and stop.
   - **Purpose:** To illustrate that effective mental change (Right Effort) often requires only a small, well-timed intervention rather than brute force.

5. **Old Memories as "Flushed Down the Toilet"**
   - **Visual Metaphor:** The past is like waste we flush away; we don’t need to cling to it.
   - **Purpose:** To encourage letting go of old, unwholesome mental patterns.

6. **Consciousness as Dependently Arising**
   - **Analogy:** Eye consciousness arises only when light, a visible object, and a functioning eye come together—not independently.
   - **Purpose:** To demonstrate that all mental phenomena are conditionally arisen, not evidence of a permanent self or soul.

7. **The "Kamma Machine"**
   - **Metaphor:** The belief in rebirth is compared to a slow, mechanical system of reward and punishment across lifetimes.
   - **Purpose:** To critique it as a disempowering belief that postpones practice.

### **Stories & Historical Examples**

1. **The Origin of Reincarnation as Brahminical Propaganda**
   - **Story:** Speaker A recounts a historical narrative where Brahmins (around 800 BC) invented the doctrines of karma and reincarnation to justify their social privilege and extract resources (e.g., animal sacrifices).
   - **Purpose:** To argue that rebirth is a social construct for control, not a core Buddhist truth.

2. **Madeleine Albright & False Memory Scandals**
   - **Story:** Reference to the 1990s recovered memory controversy, where children were coached into false memories of abuse.
   - **Purpose:** To cast doubt on "past life memories" in children, suggesting they could be similarly implanted or coached.

3. **Houdini and Séance Exposés**
   - **Story:** Harry Houdini’s exposure of fraudulent spiritualist séances in the early 20th century.
   - **Purpose:** To argue that claims of contacting the afterlife (and by extension, proofs of rebirth) are often scams with natural explanations.

4. **Putin, Trump, and "Getting Away With It"**
   - **Example:** Used as modern archetypes of the "wrong view" that one can act without consequences.
   - **Purpose:** To illustrate the dichotomy between "wrong view" (I can get away with bad actions) and "ordinary right view" (actions have consequences).

5. **Clothes Make the Man**
   - **Cultural Story:** The idea that identity is shaped by external appearances (fashion, uniforms).
   - **Purpose:** To show how we wrongly identify with the body and its adornments, fueling industries and vanity.

6. **Alzheimer’s Disease**
   - **Example:** The radical personality and memory changes in Alzheimer’s patients.
   - **Purpose:** To demonstrate that personality and memory—key components of the supposed "self"—are impermanent and fragile.

### **Overall Rhetorical Purpose**
The metaphors and stories serve two main purposes in the talk:
1. **To Demystify Core Concepts:** Making anatta (not-self), dependent origination, and Nibbana accessible through everyday analogies.
2. **To Deconstruct Traditional Beliefs:** Using historical narratives and modern examples to challenge literal interpretations of rebirth and karma, presenting them as later additions or cultural baggage rather than the Buddha’s core insight.

The dialogue heavily uses these devices to shift the focus from metaphysical speculation to present-moment, empirical practice.
