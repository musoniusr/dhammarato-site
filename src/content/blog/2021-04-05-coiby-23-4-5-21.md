### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, so

**Speaker B:** yeah, so what he was speaking right now is that he said instead of focusing what's arising, we can shift the focus to what passed away, right? Yeah, then it reminds some words in Daniel Ingram's book, The Most Core Teaching of the Buddha. In his book, he said when you become sensitive to the sensation, you begin to notice the passing away of thoughts naturally. I mean, if

**Speaker A:** you— And we can do it naturally in the sense of very passively. But another way of thinking about it, which is actually something that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and Mahasi himself agree on, is that this is to be done actively in the sense of pursuing or chasing down this, in this case that we're talking about, the fading away. To actually actively go after it, to start recognizing directly things keep dying, they keep passing away, they keep going. This moment is gone, the next moment is new, and this is gone, and it's gone, and everything keeps passing away. That in fact, once we begin to see that, then the first— the fading and the passing and then actually the cessation. And the cessation means that it's actually already gone. It's already gone. Okay, so now we're in full-blown Sunyata land, is this sensation, or the cessation after it's gone. So you see first the turmoil, and the turmoil gives activity, and then from the turmoil We see the fading away, and then from the fading away we see its death, and then the gone-ness of it. It's no longer there. Okay, and then the next step is to relinquish that, is to throw it out, to let it go. So in fact, when I'm talking to students about Anapanasati and step 10 of gladdening the mind, that actually means that steps 13, 14, 15, and 16 had happened in very rapid succession in the previous mind moments of the student. When they wake up and they see that this is an unwholesome thought and that aha, I see you, Mara, kicks off that process of that rotting away, dying out, it's gone now. And I can let go of it completely and take on the next mind moment. And so that passing away or fading away process is something that we actually want to actively pursue. Why? Because already all the time the mind has been actively pursuing, grasping, and clinging at the arising of thoughts. That this is how we grasp a hold of things, and in fact that's the job of the self-preservation instinct is to be on guard for anything that could be possibly new happening. And so we're always looking for something new that's about to happen or is happening. We've already got that training. So when the students sit down to meditate, they are actually capable of seeing these things come up because we already have much of that skill. Especially if we're looking. So the really first thing that we do is we start to see, is this thought wholesome or not? Is it worth having or not? And so we begin to label or begin to think with the discernment of, is this wholesome or is it unwholesome? Because the gladdening of the mind is surely going to be a wholesome thought that we're putting in and taking out the Mara. You remember me telling you about, "Aha, I see you, Mara." Okay, that "Aha, I see you, Mara" will then kick it out of the active or the Anicca or the arising phase into the passing away or the fading out phase. And sometimes that happens in the mind within an instant of time, an instant in the sense of about a tenth of a second or so. Anagami moment. And so this is beginning— what this is, what we begin to look for then, is those moments when things actually look like they're falling apart, fading away. And we want to especially note that with unwholesome thoughts, to make sure that we let them die and fade out, go away, be gone, out of here, and we relinquish them. So this is a way of practicing, and in this regard, we're talking about something that's done in very early practice. A lot of people who read the book and they see this somewhere in the middle of the book and they say, "Oh, this must be an advanced technique. This is when somebody gets really good at what they're doing, is that now they can see the fading away, the arising and the passing away of phenomena." Actually, no, we want to be able to get actively involved with that process. We want to really jump on it and make it fade, let it go, throw it out, relinquish it. That's what the process is geared towards. So this is actually where the Satipatthana and the Anapanasati and all of the other sutras actually do come to an agreement. Is in that arising is easy and passing away is now the new skill to be learned.

**Speaker B:** So your suggestion that we can actively let things go away, because when I was reading the book by Tuladasa, The Mind Illumined, He encourages such kind of attitude. Let it come, let it be, like all these kind of emotion feelings, like a friend. They just come and go, and if they want to stay, let them stay.

**Speaker A:** Yes, and you can do that let it be passively or actively. Okay, let me show you the distinction between actively and passively. I've got this little thing in the hand. Can you see that? No, it's already gone. Arahant, let's get it again. Okay, so there's something in the hand there. Now the easy thing to do is just turn the hand and it'll fall out like that, but Never mind. If I hold it in my hand and turn it upside down, now I have to actively let it go because I've already actively begun to cling to it. And so when we're talking about letting go or relinquishment, it's actually an activity that we have to have in the mind to actively let it go in the sense of throwing it out. Again, a very active kind of thing, just like we seize the mind by seizing the breath and making sure that it's a long in-breath and a long out-breath, we're beginning to control the breath, we can also control the mind in this way by actively throwing it out. So therefore, the rotting away, the fading away, the dying is not just something that we kind of notice out of the the corner of our eye is something that we physically and actively bring about. In order to do that, we have to develop the mind to be very fast, because it's going to die away anyway. So we have to be pretty fast to grab hold of it and wrestle it down and throw it out. You see what I mean? This is actually a very fairly speedy activity, and yet this is something that's to be done at whatever speed the student can do it, when he wakes up and recognizes that the mind is full of hindrances, is full of unwholesome thought. And we want that thought now that's arising, because while it's arising and coming, we get attached to it. But if we have now the idea we're going to make it fade away, we're going to kill it, we're going to have it go into cessation, it's going to be gone, then we're done with it. And that being done with it is also that active. So even the step 16 of the relinquishment of Anapanasati is an active thing, just like step 1 of Anapanasati is the activity of actually intentionally taking a deep long in-breath rather than just watching whatever breath is there. So when we say the fading away is to be seen as natural, yes, it absolutely is natural. But we're going to get on top of that.

**Speaker B:** I don't have direct experience to get what you mean, but a related question may be, how do you differentiate between pain and suffering?

**Speaker A:** Well, the word pain already has suffering built into it. Perhaps what you're meaning is what's the difference between sensation in the body and pain in the body?

**Speaker B:** Uh, let me be more specific. Uh, for example, when I was doing a retreat in Burma in 2016, at first, you know, when you sit for a long time, your leg will feel quite uncomfortable.

**Speaker A:** Yes, okay, I understand that. Let me ask you a question first. What's the value of sitting with the leg in pain and uncomfortable?

**Speaker B:** I don't know, because that's what the meditation encourages you to do. That,

**Speaker A:** or would you believe that not all meditation teachers teach that? That at Wat Soan Mokkh, we do not teach students to try to sit for long periods of time. We try to teach them to keep their mind alert for long periods of time, no matter what their posture is in. So if a student gets tired or his legs ache during the middle of the sitting session or towards the end of it, then it's perfectly okay and part of the instructions for him to stand up If he needs to or wants to, he can actually do walking meditation. And years ago, they would be doing walking meditation in the back of the hall, but people would complain. And so now they're invited that if you actually want to do walking meditation during the sitting time, then you can get up out of the sitting and go outside and do walking meditation out there. That's fine. It is better for you to go outside and be in the outdoor breeze and the sun or the shade and walking back and forth and being happy than it is to sit in the meditation hall in pain. Pain is not recommended for those who cannot tolerate it. Pain is actually for the advanced student a very, very interesting gym to go work out in. But you don't want to take a baby into a gym because the baby doesn't know what to do and in likelihood is going to be hurt by all of that weightlifting equipment. So we need to get big enough and old enough to where we can go work out in that gym called pain. Then in fact, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa makes a big point of that sickness is a wonderful opportunity to practice Dhamma. Why? Because we've got work to do now. I mean, would you rather just be sick and then just be sick, feel sick, think sick, act sick, and are sick? Or would you rather use that as an opportunity to practice the Dharma while the body is sick, the mind's okay, the body is sick but it can still breathe well. If it breathes well, it'll probably heal itself faster. So let me do some Anapanasati, get this old machine working and breathing well, and by naturally I'll start to feel better. That in fact, that's what killed people in the coronavirus thing, was they weren't breathing. They didn't have the strength or the stamina to put up with it. They were what they would call gasping for air, being afraid of it rather than very slowly, steadily taking in air and then slowly, steadily letting it back out over and over again until you get plenty of oxygen. So when you're sick, that's a good thing to practice, is Anapanasati, for a whole lot of reasons. So let's go back to the issue of pain in the meditation hall is almost an artificial pain that you put your body into any posture and leave it there for a long period of time, it'll begin to build up pain. An example of that, just sitting here, take your left arm or your right arm, I don't care, one of your arms, and just put it up in the air. All right, just keep it there for a while, and we'll just continue to talk. All right, just leave the hand in the air. That's all we have to do. You may start to notice a few things about it, and after 10 or 20 minutes, you'll begin to really notice some stuff about it, right? But the question is, you know that the arm is screaming in pain, you know that it's doing that. Why are we putting up with this? Is there some value or some reward in doing it, uh, that we're going to get out of it later? So now we have to do an evaluation of a cost-benefit analysis. In other words, what's the value of holding your arm in the air? Are you holding your arm in the air just because I'm holding my arm in the air and you've already determined you're not going to bring your arm down until I keep— until I put mine down? Is that the idea? Why are you holding your arm in the air?

**Speaker B:** You see, you like, uh, you asked me to do an experiment, so I'll give it a try.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it does have its own benefit for a while, but after a while the arm begins to get tired because it's doing something. It's in a posture that you're not usually in, and yet this isn't in fact what I'm talking about right now, of just raising your hand in the air and just keeping that is often done in India by guys and leaves their arm in the air for years. They're almost famous as to how bad the arm shape gets in atrophy because they've been proving that they've been keeping it up in the air. In fact, they could not after so many years of having it up in the air, they couldn't even bring it back down. So I ask you again, how long are you going to keep your arm in the air? Yes, that's right. We put up with stuff until we recognize, hey, the thought that I'm having now, there's no end to it. And meanwhile, the arm is getting more and more tired. Why don't I let the thing have a rest and now I can bring it down, you see? This is in fact the whole issue that is kind of missed by students in these long sitting sessions. That is much better to sit for short periods of time more often a day. Throughout the day, just sit and go into a state of Anapanasati, in the state of being safe and secure, pure and happy and comfortable. The Bhikkhu Buddhadasa stresses that issue about making sure the body is comfortable. Now to him, the lotus posture is the comfortable posture, but lotus posture is common in Thailand and it is of enormous effort for Westerners. I don't know about the Chinese, I imagine it depends upon your family's history as to whether the children are raised sitting on the floor, like in South China, and in Northern China they're put on furniture. So if you're raised in Southern China, I imagine that the kids sit on the floor all the time. They even eat off the floor like they do in Yunnan Province. So that's what determines your ability to sit on the floor, is that have you been doing it your whole life? And yet in the West, we have the idea that the sitting posture is in fact an important aspect of the whole practice and how long can you sit. The suttas say nothing about that. In fact, what the Buddha says is go to the forest or into an empty hut or to a pile of straw or sit under the shade of a tree. In fact, the only point of it is to get away from people. To get alone. So an empty hut, your room, that serves as that empty hut. And this is an important part. The next part of it is, is just to sit. But you don't have to sit in the cross-legged posture. In fact, the Pali word does not use cross-legged. It just said, but sit— the most important point is to sit upright. Sitting upright is the big deal. Let me explain to you why. There's two major reasons to sit up straight. One is that when the body is sitting this way straight, the gravity is pulling straight down. So it winds up over time being a comfortable posture. If the body is leaning forward or stooped or whatever, then that curvature means that the center of gravity is being affected by that curve. And in fact, this part of the body, if we're leaning over, that means there's going to be tension building up in the top part of the back. Other people will have tension in the lower part of the back depending upon their way that they're sitting. But the cure for all of it is to make sure that we're sitting up straight. Then there's the other part, and that is the breathing part. While we're slumped over, guess what? It's hard to breathe. And so if we're sitting up straight, then naturally we're open-chested and it's easier to breathe well. So because of that, the sitting up correct posture is important. But whether your legs are in a full lotus, a half lotus, a Burmese, a side posture, on your knees Japanese style, sitting on a Zen stool, sitting on a sofa, None of that stuff matters so long as you can sit comfortably. Because when you give yourself pain, the question is, why would you do that? What value is it? You already know what pain is. Now, if you've got pain that you have to deal with, that is there whether you're sitting, it's not self-induced, it's not actually created, and you know exactly how to get out of that pain. All you have to do is lower your arm to get out of that arm pain, right? That's all you had to do to get out of it. So moving the body is all we need to do to get out of this meditation kind of pain that's induced by sitting still. But there are going to be times when you are going to have to deal with real pain. And then the way to deal with real pain means the real pain that you didn't artificially bring up and you can artificially just whisk right back away, which is In fact, if you think about it, the fading away, the arising of the pain, and now intentionally doing something to make it fade away is the right thing to do, as opposed to sit there in pain thinking that the pain is going to be some magical teacher. No, the pain is actually your body giving you information. Hey, something's wrong here. We need to do something about this. It's actually a messenger service. And that we pay attention to that. So example is that if you have an insect bite and it itches, if we are ignorant of it, then we more than likely scratch it, scratching around it and whatnot. In fact, scratching an itchy spot makes it almost a good feeling. It's almost a good feeling, but not quite. It's just better than the other feeling of it just itches like heck. And besides, I got to do something about it. And so you can see that ignorance build up because now the scratching is destroying and interrupting the skin that's in the immediate vicinity of that original insect bite, making it grow, making it worse. Because we're not mindfully doing it. But if we will be mindful, we can take and put some ointment on that bite, rubbing it tenderly, saying everything's going to be all right here, and we mindfully take care of it. That insect bite will heal faster by taking correct care of it. So this is the right way to handle physical sensations. And there's even more to it than that, and that is that while that mosquito bite is sitting there thumping and screaming in sensation, we can actually take a look at it and say, wait a minute, where exactly is the sensation that I don't like so much? Because when I begin to look at it closely, the sensation I'm looking for is no longer thought of as pain, but in fact Pain means we want to push it away or get rid of it. But if we're actually looking for it, looking into it, we're no longer pushing it away. Now it's just a sensation that we can observe. And this is what they're trying to teach in the meditation session. And I congratulate them for not hiring a fleet of mosquitoes to come in and wreck your meditation hall just to make this point.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think it— but sitting long

**Speaker A:** periods of time, I don't agree with either. There will be times when you do have to deal with pain. Let's deal with it wisely, knowing that most of the pain can be managed by actually doing something to alleviate the body's crying out. In other words, while you're sitting there and the leg and the knees, uh, start to have pain, then the knees are saying, please move, please let me have some circulation. Now I personally know 5 guys, I've kept it up over time by now, I'm sure that if I knew the guys I could find a whole lot more, starting with Bhante Palo back in the 1970s, Vila Maromsi, Subhu, and other monks. Actually cannot sit with other monks. These monks have destroyed their knees to the point that it is outrageously painful for no reason at all for them to sit in the very posture that they were training in. But they trained in it for so long that they did damage rather than getting the muscles built up. They worked too hard at it. This is also possible to happen in a gym. Someone can get really hurt in a gym by trying to weight lift weights that are way too much for them. And sitting too long in meditation postures is an exact way of doing that kind of damage to oneself. And there's no real value in it because— and the way to talk about that is that Let us say that you could sit still for an hour once a day and you had good control over your mind to remove the hindrances, but at the end of that session you don't think about it, you don't care about it, you're off doing whatever, and now all of the hindrances come back and remain for 23 hours a day. Which is going to win here? The hindrances that are so comfortable, so common, and so frequent? Or this new practice that we're putting in. This is why I would recommend to do this more often a day for shorter periods of time, because the mind actually gets tired after about 20 minutes, and the body certainly gets tired after a while. So I don't recommend long sittings, I recommend frequent sittings. So instead of taking an hour a day, take 4 15-minute sessions. Or 6 10-minute sessions. But let's really work on this Sati to wake up moment by moment, taking a deep breath. Every time we take a deep breath, we remember to— and that's Sati. Every time we take a long deep out-breath, again, that's Sati. So we've got this Sati going, and the Sati's job is to make sure to investigate, to find, is this wholesome? Are not wholesome. Is this thought worth having? In other words, am I gladdening the mind or am I letting the mind be in the world? Am I taking the mind out of the world or am I leaving the mind in the world? It's another way of thinking of it or talking about it. So always we want to have this unwholesome kind of thinking to die out, to fall away. Everything's going to die out and fall away anyway, but with the unwholesome thoughts, we have it intentionally so, to be gone. But by doing that, we get really in touch with the natural arising and passing away of all phenomena. It happens very quickly, in rapid succession, so rapid no one's actually putting time on it. Oh, 1/10th, 1/20th of a second, that's how long it takes. Nobody knows. But we do know that things happen in pretty rapid succession. Things arise and fall away and arise and fall away and arise and fall away. And the faster we get it, then the faster we can see it, because some things are very slow. For instance, it takes a long time for a mountain to arise and a long, long time for the mountain to fade away. Some kinds of habits are like that too. It took a long time for us to develop that bad habit, and it'll take a long time for it to fade away. But so much of phenomena is instantaneous. It happens, it happens, it keeps happening, keeps happening. And so our job is to be on guard for that stuff that's happening that's unwholesome and throw it out, kill it off. Let's have some emptiness here. Let's have some silence.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I brought that question of pain and suffering, that after sitting in the upper torus— Sorry, the connection was lost.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it's back again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. What I said is that I brought the question of pain and suffering, that after sitting alone with one posture for a long time, after a few days, suddenly you feel no longer you suffered. It seems like pain and suffering are different, but I don't know how to do it. Actively. It's just like the suffering just go disappear by themselves, but, uh, and you can feel the pain only when you

**Speaker A:** make sure that the thoughts that are unwholesome are out of the mind will then the Dukkha fade away. That the thoughts are unwholesome The unwholesome thoughts will bring up unwholesome memories and it cascades into Dukkha. If you maintain wholesome thoughts, then that will cascade into the positive of feeling relaxed and easygoing and successful and all of that that goes with the Sukkha and the Piti of first Jhana. Naturally come about because of the kind of thoughts that we have associated with that. But if we are only noting what's going on in a kind of a natural way, then we will allow these unwholesome thoughts to come in and do their damage because we're not paying much attention to the value of the unwholesome quality or the dangerous or the Dukkha quality. Quality of these kinds of thoughts. And so, as we progress, we begin to get better and better at figuring out what is wholesome and what is not wholesome, in the sense that there's a continuum. Let's say unwholesome, really, really unwholesome stuff over here, and very, very wholesome stuff over here. Someplace we got to come in and put a line and say everything on this side of the line is unwholesome, and everything on this side of the line is wholesome. By beginning to see what is wholesome and not wholesome, that line begins to move in the direction of the wholesome, so that more and more of the things that you used to think were wholesome now wind up you can see the Dukkha in it, and those are to be avoided so that we begin to have just genuinely quite wholesome thoughts. This is the practice that we would go for, and by doing so, we're naturally going to bring ourselves into a state of mind that allows us to feel very, very good, very satisfied, very comfortable, very peaceful, feeling as if the job has been done, that we're quite successful. These are the kind of feelings that we want to generate, and this is exactly the feelings that Buddha is mentioning right there in the Anapanasati Sutta that are factors to the first Jhana, is to allow yourself to talk yourself into feeling really, really good and allow all of the other stuff to fade out, to fade away.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so you suggested to do it actively. For now, it seems for me like it's like, you know, give the mind enough time to learn about this. For example, you observe your reaction pattern, then gradually he will know that what is better, what is good, what is bad. So he will naturally like, okay, I don't want to react this way, just he will react otherwise. It's like I'm not doing it actively, it's still like passively.

**Speaker A:** Well, the concept of wholesome is the word that we normally use in English for the Pali word kusala, and yet it tends to seem to have a kind of a different meaning. But when we think of wholesome, we think of bringing things together, that is whole, and unwholesome means that things tend to fall apart. But the kusala and ekusala is actually opposite of that in the sense that there is a grass called kusala grass that is such a strong, hard, tough grass that in the time of the Buddha, it was used. They would dry it out, flatten it out, and use it as a knife because it was that strong and it would cut bread and all kinds of stuff. And so they could use that knife and it was kind of disposable knife because it goes dull easily, but when it's fresh, it works. Can't saw wood with it, but anything that's softer than that kusala leaf blade can be cut with it. So what we mean by kusala means that we can open it up and see what's going on, to where akusala looks like it is hard and tight. So we can think of these in two different kinds of concepts, but the distinction between wholesome and unwholesome then would be that the wholesome tends to be free from any more work to do, and unwholesome means yet more work to do. So wholesome takes us into the state of satisfaction. That everything is all right, everything is fine. And unwholesome thoughts take us into the realm of you got to do this, you got to do that, you got to do this over here. Even you got to do stuff you really don't want to do, but you got to do it anyway. Your survival depends upon that. And so we get this dialogue running in the mind of unwholesome thoughts, followed by unwholesome feelings, which is basically a reaction to the unwholesome thoughts. You got to go do this. You got to get up and go to work. I don't want to go to work. You got to go to work. I don't care. I don't want to go to work. And by the time this guy has had that dialogue going in his mind, he's trying to talk himself into, well, I really do feel bad and I don't want to go to work. Please, mommy, in my own mind, don't make me go to work. And so you can see all of these emotions that happen just because of this internal dialogue. If we can come to understand that dialogue, we can bring it to a halt. We can cease it. We can put it down. We can say, "Never mind, I'm okay right now." This also is a way of thinking about it in the sense of the kind of thoughts that hinder are also critical thoughts, thoughts of work to do, thoughts that this is good and this is bad. And the thoughts of this is good and this is bad, I've already said, this is good because I like it and this is bad because I don't like it. And what we're shooting for here is the integration or the wholesomeness of all things, or the nurturing. Or let's bring all of this stuff back together again. Let's let all of this wholesomeness that divides and gives us work to do and all of that and let it go for a while. We can let that die out. We can put that stuff down so that we can take a few deep breaths and just relax, just feel good. Everything's okay at this moment. And so we need to get ourselves in a really, really pleasant state. And this pleasant state that we're talking about is in fact the definition of first jhana. It's a state of Sukkha as opposed to a state of Dukkha, which is the dukkha is you got work to do.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I can feel that in daily life, for example, you, you needed to finish something before the deadline, there will be more stress But I think, but in their life, you have, you have to play different role. Remember, you, you need to be responsible for your job, you needed to do.

**Speaker A:** So, okay, so wait a minute, wait a minute. You just said that you were sitting for a long period of time and your legs hurt, and I recommended sit for shorter period times like 15 minutes or 10 minutes. And so for 10 minutes, can you say everything is all right, everything is fine. And you're saying, oh, I got to do this all the time. You can't do that all the time. You can't lift those kind of weights yet. You've got to practice getting into that state so that you can see that everything is all right, everything is fine. So don't try to think you've got to do this all the time, but you can do it 4 times a day.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm not just talking about the meditation. I mean, for example, even now you are taking job, for example, sometimes maybe you can do it very well, like 8 hours, it's not a problem. Sometimes you're not in good state, maybe you need So that time, but you still need to do like 8 hours, then maybe at the end of day you feel a bit tired, but you know, you are paid to do this for 8 hours, so you needed to do your duty. But at the end of day, maybe you can feel a bit tired, then there will be the stress.

**Speaker A:** Yes, okay, I understand that. I don't think you're telling me something that I don't know, but you are making a point of it. So what's your point? Are you going to feel bad because you feel tired? Are you going to say, I shouldn't feel tired, everybody in this factory is tired, but I should not feel tired, and I feel tired just like those people do? What is wrong with me? I hear that kind of stuff coming up somehow. You got somebody behind you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's my father, my dad.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so that's a way of thinking, is that even if you get tired, it's okay that you're tired. Don't be hard on yourself. You don't have to be hard on yourself at the end of the day because you're tired. It's better just to say, okay, I see the tiredness. Tiredness, and that's okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but I mean, with the tiredness, you cannot focus on the work. You're supposed to, you know, still to finish the work, so you have to kind of push yourself to do the work. Then comes the stress.

**Speaker A:** Okay, but you cannot work every mind moment. The mind is a monkey mind. It scatters around, and you're telling me that you're working so hard that you're not even aware that you're tired. And I'm saying, wait a minute, how do you know you're tired if you're busy working? No, you stopped working long enough to know that you were tired, correct? How did you know you got tired at the end of the day if you're also busy working?

**Speaker B:** For example, you find that you have difficulty understanding what you are reading now. For example, the question, It feels like you're difficult to come with a new idea, then you're like, "Oh, I'm tired now. I cannot think well now."

**Speaker A:** Exactly, so let me give you an example by using my finger as what we're doing, okay? And so this is the work, and so working, working, working, working, working, working, long time working, long time working, working, working, working, tired, Working, working, working, tired, tired, oh, I'm so tired. Working, working, working, working, oh, this is too much, I'm so tired. Working, working, working, oh, I'm so tired. Working, working, working. Okay, so this is the point. You're not working all the time, you're spending mind moments thinking about being tired. You're spending some mind moments feeling and being tired, which means that while you're working, you're not working all the time, that there's lots of mind moments in there where things are moving back and forth between the working and feeling tired, right? Can you get that? That you're not thinking about working all the time. There is at least some thoughts in there of being tired. Is that right? Yeah, otherwise you wouldn't even know you had gotten tired. You'd just be tired, but you weren't paying any attention to being tired. You were paying all of your attention into working, and that didn't happen. You actually know every day that you're getting tired, so you're not spending every mind moment in working. This is the point that we're making, is that because you don't have that kind of focus anyway, that no one there at that factory spends every mind moment of 8 hours a day thinking of and doing the work. Everybody's a scatterbrain, everybody's got a monkey mind. And so working one moment and thinking about Aunt Susie and having a fight with Aunt Susie, and now I'm back working, and now I'm over on Uncle George, and now I'm back working, and now I've got a problem with the husband, and now I'm back working. And this is how it goes. It's back and forth all over the place. And I'm asking you, have you not noticed that in your own mind?

**Speaker B:** If I notice that there's kind of this struggle, like, okay, go to work. Oh, I'm tired. I go to work. I notice kind of this fight. Then I seem like I can stop this struggle, okay? 'Now let's take a break,' then there's no more struggle, then the stress will go away.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so now what I'm inviting you to do, now that we know that we have sometimes— we'll call it mixed motives or mixed thoughts— we can begin to understand that, okay, now we can start paying attention to these thoughts and start judging whether they're wholesome or unwholesome. Because 'I'm tired' can be a wholesome thought or it can be an unwholesome thought depending upon our attitude about it. 'I'm tired, never mind, back to work' is a different thought than 'I'm tired, poor me.' So we're noting the tiredness, but also is it going to be noted wholesomely or unwholesomely in the sense of how do we feel about it. If we have the idea of, "Never mind, just noting tiredness, back to work, everything's good, we'll be out of here soon enough, we can handle this, tiredness or not, we're good to go," is a different kind of thought than the thought of tiredness, "Oh, poor me, oh, I wish I could quit now." And so it depends on the kind of thoughts, because if you have the thoughts of, I'm tired, but never mind, back to work, you'll probably be a little bit better at the job than the person who is having the thought, oh, I'm tired, oh, poor me, I wish we could quit now. You see the difference?

**Speaker B:** Yeah. When you feel this, like this kind of thought, you're coming, for example, you're tired, uh Now, if you are not mindful enough, you can— it can be a source of self-blaming. Then you feel not good.

**Speaker A:** Yes, we were talking about that just before. So it will be, I'm tired now and you ought not be. Stop being tired. Come on, buck up. You got to get there. And then there's the other side of you that says, oh no, I can't do it. 'Oh no, that's too much work.' 'You get going.' And so now we've got that parent-child thing going. The one who is critical telling you you should do this, and then the tired part saying, 'But I don't want to.' And so now that dialogue is going on, and while that dialogue is going on, there's no thought moments about the work. Now the work is happening on complete automatic pilot because this internal internal dialogue is going on. And that's why we need to wake up to that internal dialogue, to wake up to it and say, wait a minute, I don't care if I'm tired or not, we can do this. And so now we have it back to the nurturing. As before, it was critical. You should do the work. I don't care if you're tired or not, you ought to do it. Stop being tired and do the work, which is ordering yourself around. It's not nurturing. It's not happy thought. But we can take it and make it a nurturing thought. And so this is an example of out there on the factory floor or whatever we're doing and we get tired during the day. And that also should be a moment of taking a deep breath. Did you be surprised at how quickly taking deep breaths will take us out of tiredness? And so taking a few deep breaths and paying attention to it, you just check that out and see that perhaps you don't get quite so tired. Especially as soon as you recognize tiredness, then you go through the Anapanasati. This is a good time. Other students have asked me questions questions about this. And it winds up being a particular point in time that's an anchor. And so for you, working in the afternoon is an anchor for you to get tired, for you to know it. For another friend of mine, his issue was that he gets really frustrated and can't speak straight when his boss comes. And so we worked with that so that when the boss comes up, he can see the boss coming. While the boss is coming, he can get ready for that. He can perk himself up, get himself ready for the boss with the sense of, here comes the boss, I can handle this. It doesn't matter what the boss needs, I can get it for him. We got this wired. There's a whole lot better thought than, oh no, here comes the boss, oh no, what does he want now? Have I done something wrong? You know, those are the kind of thoughts that causes suffering before the boss even gets there. We've been in bad feelings. And so working with this particular guy, another one is a violinist with stage fright. Even though she's a masterful professional musician, she still deals with the same stage fright that she did when she was a kid. Until she recognized that she talks herself into stage fright. She talks herself into, I'm going to screw this up. And then she gets set up for it so that she's already got butterflies in her stomach before she walks out on stage. But if she can recognize that going out on stage is in fact the time that she needs to take a few deep breaths and reassure herself, we got this wired, I don't I don't care if I screw up half the concerto, I'm going to enjoy it. I'm going to get a big kick out of this even if I miss a note or two. That's not important anymore. See, before we're worried about, I got to get it exactly right, I've got to do the job exactly correctly, but that's how I get my reward is by perfection of behavior. But the real issue is, no, you can enjoy yourself before you get the question of behavior. But you don't have to be absolutely 100% excellent in order to get it right. In fact, it's possible for people to play music correctly and nobody enjoys it, and another guy makes a few mistakes but everybody enjoys it because he's flamboyant and he really likes what he's doing and he bounces around on the piano, and it doesn't even matter if he misses a note or two. And so this is the basic change of attitude that we can practice while sitting in seclusion. You can sit down at work and close your eyes and say, for the next 10 minutes, I've got nothing to do and no place to go, and I'm going to sit here and take a few deep breaths and remove all the unwholesome things out of my head. And whenever one of them arises, We're going to let it pass away immediately. Let it go, okay, and come back to the wholesome thoughts, one thought after another after another. This is the right way to practice for a short time during the day to get yourself kind of in the mood for feeling like you can do this. You can actually begin to feel successful in your life.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I feel that somehow I can do it, though I'm not clear how I do it exactly. But with more practice, maybe I can get a hang of it.

**Speaker A:** You already can do

**Speaker B:** it. It feels like that somehow I can stop this kind of like struggle, but I don't know how I manage that. It seems like it's not me I'm doing that. It's like the struggle, once I pay attention to them, the struggle just stops by themselves. I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Yes, they do. Everything comes to a rest. Enjoy that. Enjoy that, that it all falls apart. Everything is falling apart,

**Speaker B:** and it's going

**Speaker A:** to fall apart with or without your help.

**Speaker B:** But in that sense, Do you think it's like just happened passively? I mean, if you— I'm not inter— I don't feel I'm doing something actively during this process. It's just like that. This is a struggle.

**Speaker A:** You're actively watching, you're actively noticing things, but it does take a bit of effort to pay attention, to watch, to observe. And when you observe one wholesome thing after another, after another, after another, after another for a long period of time, now that we know that things are always going to be wholesome, we can relax. But so long as there's a mixture of wholesome and unwholesome, That's the time to be on guard, to be on vigil, so that we can make sure that these thoughts are only wholesome thoughts and not unwholesome. Therein lies the position that everything then has that action to it. But if you can come to the point of arising and passing away, everything is gone and everything is good to go, then now you can finally even relax that. So the first part is to throw the hindrances out. But after we have the hindrances thrown out, we can relax again at an even deeper level,

**Speaker B:** right?

**Speaker A:** And that is just to enjoy the arising and the passing away, because there it goes, and there's nothing that needs to be done at all, because everything that does arise and pass away is wholesome. It's good to go. And I'm not critical of any of it. If I start being critical again, that means that unwholesome thoughts are arising again. So if you can get yourself into that passive arising and passing away, and everything's wholesome arising and passing away, and there's no unwholesome stuff in it, that's a good place to be. Congratulations!

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I can relax. What you talk about in the second part, I can make sense of that. What confused me is that the first part, you said like, first throw away the unwholesome thoughts, then relax into that. What confused me is the first part. You know, like throw away the wholesome and unwholesome thoughts. So I don't know how I— That's the whole point.

**Speaker A:** If you have it like that, that all thoughts are unwholesome for the beginner, then that means if you throw out all your thoughts, then you are in a state of no thought or no mind state. And that means that now that we are in that state, we can't observe. Much of anything. And so if we get into that state without having all of the other Jhana factors, then it's not really a Jhana, but it is something like a Jhana, but it has no real value. And this is where all kinds of really heavy stuff— because there are hindrances still lurking there that'll come up in fearfulness, in misery, in disgust, in longing. These are the things that can re-arise if we are not, let us say, already having the skill of discerning what is a wholesome and what is an unwholesome thought. So in one case, we're saying it doesn't matter what kind of thought they are, they're hindrances out there going, we're only going to be doing noting. But the vine is going to come back, and when it does come back, the question is, does it come back wholesome or unwholesome? Well, the answer is, when we threw it out, it was unwholesome. Therefore, when it comes back, it's probably going to be unwholesome. But if we can retrain the mind into wholesome, then as we throw it out as wholesome, when it does come back, it's more than likely going to be able to come back wholesome. This is another way of looking at it. Yes, there will be times when you don't have any thought at all, but that's not the issue. The issue is whether when it does have a thought, is it going to be a wholesome thought or an unwholesome thought? The answer to that would be, how do you tell what a wholesome and an unwholesome thought is? That's a skill to be developed. As you see the danger in thoughts, you'll begin to let them go, relinquish them, set them in the dustbin, and don't use them anymore. And so we begin to narrow things down so that many of the things that we thought used to be wholesome, now we see they're not so wholesome, and I can get rid of that one too. And now I have even less to do. And that's one of the ways that you can see whether something is wholesome or not, is whether you still have have to do something with it or not. An example would be the visa. Right now in Thailand, my visas are very, very easy. It's so easy that I only have to just say something or do something to take care of most of the year, and then it only takes about a day's work to get the paperwork and send it to the lawyer, and everything is done. 10 years ago, the visa was the number one job of my whole life. That months before the visa was due, I was making sure that I had all the paperwork. And I wasn't quite sure, and there was doubts, and they changed the rules and all that kind of stuff. But now the way that I do it is just that easy. I've done it so many times in so many ways, I know exactly what the procedure is and everything goes. So this is the way that we begin to practice our Dhamma. Is so that we know exactly how things are going to go, which means that we can get ourselves into that state of Sukkha easily. Easily we can come into a state of Sukkha and get rid of those hindrances because we've been here before, we've done that. But in the beginning, we have to inspect every thought. Is this worth having or is this not worth having? This is one's right effort. It's in the sutta, you know.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I'll try to pay attention to those moments that there's struggle and try to make sense of what you are seeing.

**Speaker A:** Let them go. When you see yourself struggling, you can just say, hey man, It doesn't matter why I was struggling, I don't have to. You don't have to say why I'm struggling, that's just another form of struggle. He's got to go find out why. No, we don't need to know why, we can just say I don't care, I don't have to struggle.

**Speaker B:** But how would this— would you comment on this? I mean, if you ask some question why, maybe you change your diet, you will kind of do sports. You feel like that.

**Speaker A:** You're looking for something big and long-lasting and whatnot like that. And I— and what I will say is, yes, that kind of investigation is worthwhile also, is to be careful that if you're taking medication, look at what, um, uh, effect that medication will have on the body. If you're eating a different kind of food, notice the effect that that food is having on the body. Yes, let's do that. But what we're talking about in the Anapanasati directly is to notice that some of the food that we eat is nothing but a thought. And so we need to actually investigate and look in that. Is this a wholesome thought? Is this thought going to give me indigestion or what? Is this the kind of thought that's wholesome or not? Because in fact, much of the unwholesome behavior is because of the unwholesome thoughts. And so as we have more and more pure thoughts, we have less and less behavior. And the behavior we have is generally noble, well received, friendly.

**Speaker B:** Uh, you just said with more and more pure thoughts we have less behavior. You mean we'll have less?

**Speaker A:** What I'm saying is that most of our behavior is unwholesome. Most of our behavior is fixing things that aren't broken. Most of our behavior has to do with buying things that we want, and after we own them, now we've got to take care of them. And if we didn't buy them in the first place, then we wouldn't have to take care of them. Okay, so as we live in more and more wholesome thoughts, that means that we want less and less and we stop buying so much stuff. And when we stop buying so much stuff, we don't have to work so hard to get the money that we need to buy the stuff. And so it circles downward in the sense that the easier I take it, the easier things are. The less work I have to do, the less work I find to do, and the less work I find to do, the less work there is to do. And so we spiral downward into a state of more and more rest, more and more peace. But in the normal world, it's more and more work to do, more and more anxiety, more and more hills to climb. And so this is quite opposite of what we've been training to do with our skills of life, skills of what you would call critical thinking. And now we're just nurturing ourselves into a nice state of peace and quiet. Everything's okay.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I can make— I can make a sense of that.

**Speaker A:** Well, good. Let's go practice that. Let's just go practice just being okay. Let's have some wholesome thoughts. Everything is all right, everything's fine. No place to go, nothing to do, no work to do, no problems to solve. And we can do that for 10 minutes a day, just having the kind of thoughts of, wow, isn't this a nice world? Isn't this a good breath? Isn't this a nice moment? Arahant. Everything's going my way.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I'll have a try.

**Speaker A:** All right, great. We'll see you later, Kobe.

**Speaker B:** Okay, thank you. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, primarily led by **Speaker A (Dhammarato)**, centers on **actively cultivating the perception of impermanence (anicca)** and using that insight to release unwholesome states. Here is a structured summary of the key points:

### **Core Teaching: Actively Pursue the Passing Away**
*   **Shift in Focus:** Instead of passively observing whatever arises in meditation, one should **actively shift attention to the fading and cessation** of phenomena, especially unwholesome thoughts.
*   **The Process:** Observe a thought (e.g., a hindrance), see it as unwholesome ("Aha, I see you, Mara"), which initiates its fading, death, and cessation. Then, **actively relinquish it**—throw it out.
*   **Why Active?** The mind is already trained to grasp at arising phenomena. The new skill is to actively pursue the ending. This is not an advanced technique but a foundational practice found in Satipatthana and Anapanasati.

### **Application in Meditation & Daily Life**
*   **Gladdening the Mind (Anapanasati):** Replacing an unwholesome thought with a wholesome one (like "everything is okay") is an active process of gladdening. Steps of observing fading, cessation, and relinquishment can happen rapidly.
*   **Dealing with Pain:** Distinguish between self-induced pain (like from forced posture) and unavoidable pain.
    *   **Self-induced pain:** It's a messenger; heed it. Change posture, walk, or adjust. Don't idolize pain. Frequent, shorter, **comfortable sittings** are better than long, painful ones.
    *   **Unavoidable pain:** Use it as a gym for practice. Investigate the sensation mindfully without the "pain" narrative, and use breathing (Anapanasati) to manage it.
*   **In Daily Struggles (e.g., Work Fatigue):** The mind oscillates between task-focused thoughts and "I'm tired" thoughts. The key is to **change the relationship to the "tired" thought**.
    *   **Unwholesome:** "I'm tired, poor me, I can't go on." (Creates internal conflict and suffering).
    *   **Wholesome/Nurturing:** "I'm tired, never mind. Take a breath. Back to work. We can handle this." This reduces stress and improves focus.

### **Key Distinctions & Clarifications**
*   **Active vs. Passive Letting Go:** Letting go isn't just passive allowance ("let it be"). It can be an active **throwing out** of what you've identified as unwholesome, akin to actively opening your hand to drop something you're clinging to.
*   **Pain vs. Suffering:** Physical sensation is one thing; the **mental commentary** ("this is bad, I can't stand it") is the suffering (dukkha). Removing unwholesome thoughts about a sensation allows the dukkha to fade, even if discomfort remains.
*   **Wholesome (Kusala) vs. Unwholesome (Akusala):**
    *   **Wholesome:** Thoughts that lead to integration, peace, satisfaction, and less work. They are "good to go."
    *   **Unwholesome:** Thoughts that lead to fragmentation, anxiety, internal conflict, and more work/problems to solve.
    *   **Practice:** Actively judge thoughts on this spectrum. The goal is to move the dividing line so that more things are seen as unwholesome and relinquished, leading to greater peace.

### **Practical Advice**
1.  **Practice Frequently, Not Just Long:** Do multiple short sessions (e.g., 4 x 15 mins) of active Anapanasati throughout the day rather than one long, painful sit.
2.  **Use Life's Anchors:** Use predictable daily triggers (afternoon fatigue, boss approaching, stage fright) as cues to take deep breaths and actively cultivate wholesome thoughts.
3.  **Cultivate Wholesome Inner Dialogue:** Replace the critical inner parent ("You must!") with a nurturing voice ("It's okay, we can handle this").
4.  **End Goal:** Through consistent practice, the mind increasingly dwells in wholesome states. Eventually, one can relax into simply observing the **natural, wholesome arising and passing away** of phenomena without struggle, in a state of peace where "everything is all right."

**In essence:** The talk advocates for a proactive, discerning meditation practice that targets the **ending** of unwholesome states as the direct path to reducing suffering and cultivating a peaceful, gladdened mind both on and off the cushion.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors and stories** to explain meditation concepts, particularly around letting go of thoughts and dealing with pain. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Key Metaphors**
1. **"Chasing down the fading away"** – Actively pursuing the moment when thoughts die or pass away, rather than just passively noticing.  
2. **"Aha, I see you, Mara"** – A story/metaphor from the Buddha’s teachings, where recognizing an unwholesome thought (“Mara” as temptation or hindrance) begins the process of letting it go.  
3. **"Sunyata land"** – The emptiness or "gone-ness" after a thought ceases.  
4. **"Rotting away, dying out"** – Unwholesome thoughts are like something that decays; we can actively speed up their death.  
5. **Holding an object in the hand** – Demonstrating **active vs. passive letting go**:  
   - *Passive*: Turning the hand so the object falls out naturally.  
   - *Active*: Clinging to it, then consciously releasing it.  
6. **"Gym called pain"** – Pain as a gym where advanced students “work out,” but beginners shouldn’t force themselves into painful meditation postures.  
7. **"Mosquito bite"** – Itching as a sensation; mindfully caring for it (e.g., applying ointment) vs. scratching ignorantly and making it worse.  
8. **"Mountain"** – Some habits or phenomena arise and fade slowly, like a mountain; others are instantaneous.  
9. **"Kusala grass"** – Wholesome (kusala) is like a sharp, strong grass blade that can cut; unwholesome (akusala) is hard and tight.  
10. **"Disposable knife"** – Kusala is useful but doesn’t last; it’s about skillfulness, not permanence.  

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1. **Meditation retreat in Burma** – Speaker B shares sitting for long hours, feeling leg pain, and noticing how suffering can disappear even if pain remains.  
2. **Indian ascetics with raised arms** – Some yogis hold an arm up for years, leading to atrophy; used to question the value of self-inflicted pain in meditation.  
3. **Monks with damaged knees** – Story of monks who injured their knees by forcing prolonged sitting postures.  
4. **Stage fright violinist** – A musician who talks herself into anxiety before performances; she learns to shift her thoughts to enjoyment rather than perfection.  
5. **Visa renewal process** – Speaker A compares his once-stressful visa paperwork to now-effortless routine, illustrating how practice makes dealing with thoughts easier over time.  
6. **Factory worker tired at the end of the day** – Used to discuss the internal dialogue between critical thoughts (“I must work”) and resistance (“I’m tired”), and how to shift to nurturing thoughts.  

### **Core Themes Illustrated**
- **Active relinquishment** vs. passive observation.  
- **Pain as a messenger** to be responded to wisely, not endured blindly.  
- **Thoughts as wholesome/unwholesome** and the need to “throw out” unwholesome ones quickly.  
- **Short, frequent practice** is better than long, painful sessions.  

These metaphors and stories make the abstract meditation instructions more tangible and practical.
