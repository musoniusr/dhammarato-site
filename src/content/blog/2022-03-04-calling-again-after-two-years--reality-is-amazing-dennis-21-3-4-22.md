### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Well, Dennis, it's really good to see you again. It's been a while, and from what we have just been talking about before we turned the recorder on, it sounds like that you're experimenting with and enjoying a lot of success in your practice, and I wanted to congratulate you for that.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** And that one of the things that you were talking about was, is that now that I'm seeing things clearly, I recognize everything before was upside down.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And that this is what the Buddha refers to as ignorance in the Second Noble Truth is the reason that we are attracted to things that we like, is because of this ignorance of everything is upside down.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And the reality is, is that everything is already okay, that you're still alive, you're still breathing right now, you're still here. That means you were quite successful at getting here now. Yeah, and very few of us want to congratulate ourselves for just being alive. It's mind-boggling, right? I know some people think 40 years is quite a lot, but when you got 75, 76 years on it, it's like, wow, this is really interesting stuff, this life.

**Speaker B:** It feels like the practice compacts 76 years into like 4, or is it, you know, like definitely?

**Speaker A:** I know what you mean by that in the sense of waking up finally. That one of the ways of thinking about it is, is that it does— the waking up process that people have with the Dharma, of beginning to pay attention, look at the kind of thoughts they have and recognize that most of those thoughts are rule-bound, rule-based, that we learn those thoughts as kids, and we're just continuing to act like kids. And so what happens is, is that we begin to grow up very quickly. Yeah, you grow up really, really fast, that we put some years on in a great big hurry. There we were, stuck at the age of 6 or 7 or 13 or whatever, uh, for 20 years, and now within a few months or a year or two We do all of that growing up to where now we're actually the age that we are, rather than living according to a set of rules that we learned when we were kids.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that's the perfect way to say it. I mean, it's almost like a natural thing.

**Speaker A:** So, you know, well, it's all— it's also very well known. There are passages in the Bible that talk about that, that Paul wrote that when I was a child I played with childish toys, but now that I'm an adult I put away those childish things. Now basically we're not talking about a toy doll or a little truck, um, a teddy bear. We're talking about putting away, um, the way that we thought as a child, which as children we learn jealousy, we learn to get our way by being angry, by holding out. But we also have an internal base of dependency that every child within us feels like we're not good enough. All on our own, that we've got to go do something or get something or fix something in order to qualify for the next breath.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's the biggest— I think the only thing that I had hardest time with is that, because it's frustrating. Because not because it's not true, it's because it's so true that no matter what you do, you can't make it any better than what it is already. And that gets people like, whoa!

**Speaker A:** Right, because we've been taught to strive. And when we relax and say, hey, I don't have to strive anymore, then that old rule-based, let us say, idea, concept, kind of a viewpoint. In the Pali, they've got a word for it exactly, the Samma Sanghappa. And then I normally translate that as attitude. But another way of talking about it is a tendency. It's not really a thought, not fully formed thought. It's just a tendency. The tendency of I need something. The tendency of I'm not good enough. The tendency of I will be all right later if— and that's often not vocalized or expressed, but it's still the tendency of the mind.

**Speaker B:** It's a feeling, you know, like it's more of like a Like a drive.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's a drive. I like that. And in fact, it is a drive. And that fits in with TA and Transactional Analysis. They developed— I'll go into the history if you want to, but they developed 5 drivers. And I've come to see that 3 of the drivers are really the same driver. And the other two drivers are really the same driver. Okay. And in these drivers, one of them is hurry up. And I had a whole lot of hurry up when I was a kid. Get it done in a hurry. Be the first in line. Okay. That kind of thing. Another aspect of that is to be strong. To be tough, to stand up. These kind of people who have that driver wind up being bullies, police, boxers, sometimes politicians, and they bully their way around. Okay. And then there is the other one. The third one in that group is be perfect. You got to get it right. Now, you can see how these three work in combination. In fact, a CEO will be both a bully and getting it right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I see what you mean. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, because if you can't get it right, then he's just a bully. Now he's just a gangster.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like he's justifying what he's doing.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. But when we have both of those drivers, or in fact, we also— every one of us has a subtle hurry up that can be— in fact, one of the expressions of hurry up is anxiety.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** In Christianity and other places, they talk about patience. But what we're talking about here is a much deeper level of patience in the sense that patience on the surface is like, I want this or I want that, and I've got to be patient in order to get this or that. But that deeper level is, is that we learn to be patient Because everything is already there. I don't have to wait for anything. I'm not even waiting. But the word waiting tends to have a completely different meaning now because that's the only thing there's left to do. It's just waiting around, just hanging out.

**Speaker B:** You know, that's the thing that blows my mind the most is is that, like, I don't know, like, not to sound all, like, weird or whatever, but the reality is, or what we could call reality, as opposed to what we're used to, is like, is completely all right. Like you said, it's already like it's effortless. It has no sense of like stuckness, like it has no sense of stopping, like stop, you know, it doesn't have that.

**Speaker A:** It's got no sense of being driven. Yeah, yeah, it's so beautiful, like it's truly beautiful that we're not driven by this hurry up, that we're no longer in a hurry. We're not driven by, um, uh, you, you got to put on the show. You got to be something you're not, which is to be strong, be tough. And we're not driven by trying to get it right, trying to learn it all, trying to know everything, trying to figure it all out. Then in fact, what happens is, is we become comfortable that we know enough. We'll not ever get it all. Here's an example of that that I just heard just today on YouTube, and it impressed me. And so I thought that I would tell you about it, is that the lady said, in fact, what she said was, is thinking that you're tall does not make you tall. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay. But guess what? Thinking that you're tall enough makes you tall enough.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, it's like with time, even like how we experience time, like as opposed to like when you're thinking about all of the stuff that you're supposed to be doing as opposed to just— there's like that old Zen saying like being time. And it's like how you say it's like resting in that already patient. Like, because it's weird how everything in your body and your senses, everything that isn't you is so much more chill. Like, it seems so much more like it doesn't notice you at all.

**Speaker A:** Right, right. Because it goes in reverse. That in fact this is the whole quality of staring at somebody across a crowded room and they immediately look to see who is it just looking at them and they catch your eye immediately and then you're shy, you look away. How is it that we know that? That's not a sixth sense, but it is picking up. It's almost like the body itself is an antenna. And if we're paying attention to what the body is feeling, then we can pick up on all kinds of things that we didn't before. An example of that is that— and I'll start with it— is this example that elephants can hear their herd very, very far away, 50, 100 kilometers, something like that. Because they can feel the ground with their great big feet. And the elephants that are traveling that distance away pound the earth and put enough vibration so that they can experience that feeling and orient themselves towards that herd so that they could catch up with it. They do that by sensing the way that you can sense things. And I do this with In fact, one of the biggest diagnostic tools that I have in working with my network, especially hard drives, is my hand. To hold that hard drive and feel its clicks, its pops, its rotations, its spin-ups, and that kind of stuff, because it's always got a music to it when it's working properly. Yeah, and I can hold that hard drive and feel what it's doing. A lot of People do that when they're racing cars. They feel the motorbike. They can sense everything that's happening in that motorbike because it's through the vibrations. Those vibrations are coming in from all over the body. OK, and so there's more of a sense to the body than just the way that we think of it in the sense of touch. That one of the ways of developing this is with the Mudras, where you're putting your fingers very close to the thumbs without touching them until you can actually sense that, yeah, you can actually feel that thumb and index finger close to each other without actually touching, because the touch is a different feeling than this sense of connection.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's strange how you could be on a motorbike and all of that is happening, and all of that gives you the sense that you're the one in control. It's so crazy how that works. There's no separation between the sense of— obviously, it's not that you have control. It's just that it's making up this sense of all these sensations are giving you this sense of something is happening right now.

**Speaker A:** Right, but that sense of control while on a motorbike at whatever speed limit that the individual can manage, and feeling in control, is part of the exhilaration of riding the motorbike, is that you're actually in control of this thing while you're weaving in and out or doing kind of crazy things, at least for you, because everybody's testing their own limits. Yeah, now we can actually use that in the sense of meditation. How can I feel so in control of this moment while I'm just sitting here without a motorbike? I don't need a motorbike to have that feeling or that sense of being absolutely in control of this. I can handle this. Yeah, and it has a sense of exhilaration to it. Exhilaration of knowing that you've got this. And so that point about the motorbike that you're making, yes. So get— if you've actually done that with motorbikes or you've done that even with bicycles, I mean, I've had friends that could stand on one foot on the seat and the other one on the steering wheel, or the steering bars, the handlebars in the middle. And steer it with the bottom of his foot on a bicycle. I'm like, I don't know how people do that on bikes.

**Speaker B:** I'm like, how the heck do you do that?

**Speaker A:** Well, he was just an amateur. He was just playing around. These good— some of those guys can then jump up in the air and do a flip and land back in the same way, but I don't know that. But that's being in control. So that's the whole point. That's why people do that kind of stuff. It gives them a sense of being in control of the body. This is one of the reasons why people want to be like Putin. Putin wants to feel that sense of control, that sense of power. Yeah. Why do we want that? Is because we feel afraid without it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, for sure. Well, yeah, because everything— then everything's just you know, as it is, pretty much.

**Speaker A:** And out of control, because that's the other side of being in control and knowing that you're in control and the feeling of the exhilaration. The only other option is to feel out of control.

**Speaker B:** It's so— it's— but that's the crazy part is like all of the control is just stress, like It's just like not understanding that there's nothing wrong. Everything's cool.

**Speaker A:** Oh, but that's actually the being in control, the one who is out of control. And by the way, we learned that when we were little kids. We came from a position at being born of being out of control.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And then we raised into childhood and there we were in first grade and we're out of control and the teacher's in control. And then we're in the playground. We're out of control. The bully's in control. And all that goes on and on and on. And many of us grow up feeling out of control. And here you have Vladimir Putin, who has been working very hard to get his mind in control. And now he's trying to hold a war because he's got to maintain that sense of I'm in charge here because he can't deal with things in his own mind. So in fact, we're doing it by trying to control— he's trying to control the motorbike called Ukraine.

**Speaker B:** That dynamic exists in every relationship that isn't genuine. Like, it exists in every— especially with men and women, like, especially, like, that's so obvious.

**Speaker A:** The power trip. Yeah. Especially the power trip of the man wanting the woman to be his mommy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And she doesn't want to be his mommy. She wants to be his friend or the mommy to other babies.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that's one of those things that need to be resolved so that they're very happy with the relationship that they do have together rather than the girl, for instance, getting the guy as a rough diamond, and she's going to take her little hammers and chisels and she's going to put some facets on this guy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's so funny.

**Speaker A:** Make it shine.

**Speaker B:** I think that's one of the most intense ways you can learn how to be, you know, like more in your own space and your own, like, learn how to, like, do all this is like when you, you're able to love people without needing, like, without having to make something out of it. That's really different. Like, it's difficult because you have to learn to do that. Like, you have to learn, you know, it's a skill.

**Speaker A:** Literally, it's a skill to be developed. Yeah, absolutely. And these are part of the skills that we're developing that in fact, the first part of the skill is learning to make friends with our better half. Then we learn to make friends with our dark side. And when we're completely integrated with our in and our dark and our bright and our parent and our child and our adult and become unified, the skills that we have of doing that are the very skills that we need to deal with other people, whether they have that integration or not.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's just like what blows my mind is how I'm alive and I learn all this. Like, that's how— what blows my mind is like how you learn this and you don't even know like how really. Like, you just pay attention and then that's it.

**Speaker A:** You know, yeah, it's just— that's the whole of it, is look. Remember to look. And when you look and you find something there that needs to be, let us say, dealt with, we deal with it easily. And we can then gain the habit of, hey, I can deal with anything easily. Oh, an unwholesome thought, out it goes. I handle that just like— well, just throw the stuff out. This unwholesome and everything becomes really easy. And so when we do that enough, then we begin to get the attitude, hey, everything's easy. And then we're not driven anymore because everything is already easy. There's nothing hard left. We're not in a hurry. We're not trying to be tough. We're not trying to get it right. Just everything is okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's funny because like everything is okay and all that. And then there's like also the energy that gets released because everything's okay, you know, and all that energy that you've been suppressing because holding it all back, you know.

**Speaker A:** Right. And in fact, we've been spending a lot of energy and a lot of effort trying to hold it back to where in fact it was holding itself up all along and it didn't need to be held back. It's very much like seeing somebody, you know, you see the football football players that they've got these big ramps and they take and put their elbow in it and up 2, 3, 4 and push on it. Well, a lot of us are doing that mentally with some sort of rules or laws that we've got in our mind, and we're just pushing against that rule, not being able to get past it. Like you're not good enough and thoughts like that. And so we're actually spending a lot of energy trying to and failing at meeting our own standards.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and it's— that's, you know, it's so crazy because it's like you— like, I already knew you were going to relate to all this, and because obviously we're human.

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's like, I think the biggest grow-up part for me of like the last 2 years have been when I realized that the person I love the most, I couldn't love as much as I wanted because I realized that I failed to love myself and meet the standards that I always knew that I could be. And, and it wasn't like an inadequate thing. It was like, oh, like, it's not even about that. It's like, it's like the only reason I never met them is because I thought I couldn't. Like, I thought that there was a problem with me, that there was like— it's who I am. It's not my standards. It's who— it's who I am naturally.

**Speaker A:** Like, that's a really good example of look how much effort you put into— you're not good enough.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's like this old joke. It's like you you do everything you want only at the end to get the opposite of what you intended. You know, it's like because you kept like, I don't know, it's like so weird. It's so weird how life, it's just different. It's just different because it's like, I mean, for me it's still new. So it's like, it's still kind of like, wow, like everything is still so like, like a It's how everything reflects differently. It's like how the Buddha uses the word convention and then the word like the reality and how each play with each other and react to one another and how it all kind of mingles together. And it's like so strange how obvious it is. And then it's like the more you realize how obvious it is, the more funny it is. Because it's like, how? How? You know, you're like, wow, but you know how, but you don't. And it's like, it's just, it's a, you're amazed by your own, like, by the mind, like what life is, like how it works. Like, it's just crazy.

**Speaker A:** That's a good way of putting it, is actually, we can use that word amazing in the sense that There is so much happening all the time. We couldn't possibly take in everything that's happening because we can only focus one thing at a time, but we can keep that openness. The problem with most people is that they spend so many of the mind moments on the internal rather than paying attention to the senses. And so by paying attention to the senses and paying attention to what's going on there, we also recognize when the thought system is interrupting us from being in the here now. It was literally being in the here now means to be in the senses as opposed to being in the past or the future is being in the mind, being in conceptual thought.

**Speaker B:** It's, it's, yeah, because that's what time is like. Time is just basically like memories of things that you keep on reflecting on.

**Speaker A:** And, you know, that's right. Time is an illusion. And that it's true that there is movement, and movement goes in cycles. And what we call a year and think of as time is nothing but the interrelationship between the Earth and the Sun. And that it's actually— you've probably heard that there is not 24 hours in a day. Why do the clocks all have 24 hours a day when in fact it's only 23 hours and 56 minutes? Okay, we do one circle. To do exactly one circle takes 23 hours and 56 minutes and a few points. Why do we measure it as, um, 24 hours? Is because by the time the Earth is moved around in a circle, it's also moved forwards in distance, so its relationship to the Sun is different now, and it needs an additional 4 minutes to catch up to be actually high noon.

**Speaker B:** Wow, that's crazy. I never knew that at all. Our time is 4 minutes delayed. We're 4 minutes behind.

**Speaker A:** One full circle is not a day. One full circle plus the amount of time that we have, our distance that the Earth has moved in order for it to line up so that the Sun is directly overhead again.

**Speaker B:** That's crazy. It's like, like, how the heck? Like, how does the Earth know?

**Speaker A:** It doesn't. It's just spinning around. It's the humans that know.

**Speaker B:** Ah, okay. Wow. Yeah. Okay.

**Speaker A:** It's only the humans that know this, and we've done that through observation. But you have to look really closely to see that the Earth spins in 23 hours and 56 minutes in one full rotation, but it takes just a little bit more for the sun to line up to make it high noon again.

**Speaker B:** It's interesting how you mentioned that time is actually like— because these are like gradations of the same experience. So like, it's like time is actually movement, but then if you look closer to movement, it's still. And then if you look close enough, it's actually both. And then if you look close enough, it's like you can't tell the difference.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. So we go down into that kind of reality, but we can also see that same procedure by going down into the mind. That first, our thoughts, when we're beginning our practice, our thoughts look really solid, big, tough, me. And as we practice more and more and begin to recognize that we can change that thought any time that we want to, it becomes less real, less physical, and more like a bubble or sea foam. Yeah, but in fact, that's one of the descriptions of it. Everything is like sea foam because that's where the mind is. It's just bubbling, popping a new bubble about once every tenth of a second or so. And that's all we are, is just a bubbling. So if that's true, then we can bubble green instead of blue. Just because we had a blue bubble doesn't mean we got to stay a blue bubble, which is the way that we have been trained. But now we just recognize that we can change the mind to be anything that we want to. We don't have to get in and stay in that groove that we picked up when we were kids.

**Speaker B:** It's all— it's It's great because, like, I remember, like, I really was struggling with, like, the monk and, like, wanting to be a monk and not wanting to be a monk. And I don't know if you remember that, but I remember.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I do. I do. I remember.

**Speaker B:** It's so funny because now it's like it doesn't even matter. Like, it's almost like, of course, like, it's tempting and all that, and like it's lovely and everything, but it's almost like Like, if it's meant to be, it's meant to be. And if it's not meant to be, it's meant to be. But I could still be happy. Like, that was never about being— like, that has nothing to do with being a monk. It's like, you know, being happy has nothing to— like, of course there's— like, you know what I mean? So, you know, I do precisely.

**Speaker A:** In fact, a lot of people want to be a monk, want to be a monk, they make themselves miserable wanting to be a monk. They work really hard, then they finally ordain. And then after they become a monk, they're still working really hard. They're not a good enough monk. It's like, and they could have dropped all of that struggle with or without the ordination. The ordination is optional.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's crazy. I don't know, like, I know why, but it's like, man, you look back on yourself and you're like, what? Like, why were you tripping so much? But it's like, and also like, I think it's because I personally try to avoid sadness. Like try to avoid pain, try to avoid relationship, try to avoid— I think that's what most people think like all of this is for is to avoid relationship, which is like the opposite of what this is. It's probably so intimate and so like, it's like so different because like I think when you read it with the lens of like I hate life and this is for me to stop, to like get out of this It's like you get this impression that the Buddha is this person that's just like crazy and trying to make your life like this solid brick that doesn't do anything. And that's how I saw it. But now it's like, oh no, it's actually the complete opposite. And it's almost like a fairy tale if you really want to match it up, because most people think this is a waste of time and all that. And in reality, it's kind of funny because they're doing it anyways. They're already doing it regardless That's the beauty of it. It's almost like you're just amazed by how people do it and they're talking to you and they have this personality and everything. And it's like they're doing the same thing you're doing. You just know, like you said. And I think that's the only difference between— like you used to mention, a noble mind and a human. Mind, like a normal human mind. And then it's like a noble mind knows that this is all like it's greater than the context in which you find yourself in.

**Speaker A:** You know, it's— yeah. Yes. And that the quality of life itself is that most valuable thing.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Being alive, staying alive, being able to take that next breath is so marvelous. Just one more breath. This will do. Don't have to worry about the future. Just let's take this breath.

**Speaker B:** And yeah, it's like that's— you said this thing a long time ago when I was like right on, like kind of like on the edge of like kind of going through a lot of things, and you said like, um, now this is— now you're gonna like start to discover who you really are, you know? Like, you're gonna really start to discover like, oh, like all these years you've been doing this, like you've been acting this out and doing these things, and then now because all these things are basically like coming up, and now you get to like really know who you are. And that's in that sense of, well, go ahead and really look. And it's almost crazy because I don't know if this is all just self-prophecy and you're just doing it because you're like, you're just, you know, doing the effort to figure things out. But it's almost like funny because no matter, like, you can say like, oh, you already been through all this, so you already know how this goes, you know, you already know the process and how this kind of works out. And that's what's funny is like humanity is just like this weird clunky thing that you can kind of unbox in the same way. And, and, you know, everybody kind of has the same thing. It's like the same way. And what's crazy is there's no humans. It's just like, it's like what people say is that uniqueness. Everything is so unique in its own, its own way.

**Speaker A:** Well, one of the ways of looking at it is, is that The Dhamma itself, when we first start looking at the Dhamma, it's complicated. It's got 3 of this and 4 of that and 6 of those and 4 more of these things and 8 of that and 12 of this and 16 of those, and on and on those numbering systems kind of go. The actual rationale behind that is those numbering systems just are mnemonics to help the teachers and the ones who were studying the Dhamma to remember that there are five aggregates and you have to count them up and get them all five. And there's also five hindrances. You need to count them up and get them all five like that. So, but ultimately the Dhamma itself is very, very simple. It's very easy. There's nothing much to it at all. And that is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. That's the whole thing. And we can also get a little more complexity into it by understanding it in the sense of the Four Noble Truths, that there is dukkha, there are reasons and causes, and when you don't have those reasons and causes, you feel a whole lot better. And then this is how we can apply that so that we can feel not dissatisfied, we could come back to a state of satisfaction. So it's actually quite simple. Now, what's complicated is Dukkha and how people avoid it, because it's actually built in with ignorance. In other words, the complexity is all based in ignorance. The wisdom and the truth is actually quite small. It's a very small, tight little package, Dukkha Sukkha, Dukkha, or Nirodha— your choice. Can you remember which side you're going to flip or flop on? Because normally we are flipping or flopping according to our habits of flipping or flopping rather than according to our wisdom of flipping and flopping. So the point is to turn the light on and take a look at what's going on, and that's all there is to it. Except that we have to do that with every darn little ignorant thing that we come across, is turn the light on, take a look at it, and recognize, hey, I don't have to flip, I can flop instead. I don't have to flip out, I can just flop. I like that.

**Speaker B:** You could just flop, right?

**Speaker A:** I can just flop. I don't have to flip out. And that's always our choice. And we have been spending way too much of our time ignorantly flipping out. And now you're learning that you can just flop instead. And it's okay that life is a flop.

**Speaker B:** It's like the more intense it gets, the more you accept life.

**Speaker A:** Like, it's like the more intense it becomes, like, even though— Yes, is it really intense, or are you paying closer attention to whatever intensity that was there all along?

**Speaker B:** That, yeah, that's the part that is the surprising part. It's like a calm intensity. It's not like a— it's like a rich like a rich substance. It's not— it's thick, you know, like in a metaphorical— but it's a bright light, but it's not burning light.

**Speaker A:** In other words, you can use the light to see rather than being blinded by looking into the light.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. And it's just wild. I think it's the weird part is how we— okay, yeah, a lot of the buts, you know, like, yeah, everything's good and all that, but then, you know, you hear somebody say, but, but, but, but, but, but this and but that. And a lot of the buts for me came from like the fear of like, oh, something really bad could happen to you. So are you ready for it?

**Speaker A:** You know, like the answer is I can handle it. Yes, I am ready for it. Yeah, I can handle it.

**Speaker B:** And that's the thing, is like, you— it's like, uh, it's so crazy how like we just worry about things though. For me at least, like worrying about things that not even happening yet. So it kind of gets in the way of all of that.

**Speaker A:** And it's— but that is so typical as part of the culture that we live in, is that you better be careful because something's going to go really bad if you don't. You got to do your homework. You got to do this, you got to do that, because something really terrible is going to happen.

**Speaker B:** Why do you think, I mean personally I guess, why do you think life is so, like not like the life that we're used to, I'm saying like real life, like why do you think reality, like nature, is so calm and, like I know it has like, it has this harmony, I wouldn't say it's calm, but it has this almost like this— Sila, how about The word that the Hindus have, the word Sila, has the quality of play or dancing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it has this almost like— It's got no purpose to it, it's just got beauty of motion. Everything is just dancing, lilting, moving.

**Speaker B:** It always makes me think about when my body, like when the body and all that stuff goes away, it always makes me think like, wow, like when I was born, like, well, it's kind of like the reverse. It's like you open your eyes and wow, you know? And then like when you die, and I always think because I have like friends and family and people and like especially one friend that I love the most and And like love that, like, it's so intense that it hurts, you know, like that, you know, it's like that vulnerability. And I always think like, I'm sorry, I'm getting like teary because it's like emotional, but it's always like, how do, like, I know, like, I'm not saying how, but It's kind of crazy because like it's like a dance, but then it like ends. So it's like, like it's like beautiful, but it's still— it's beautiful, right?

**Speaker A:** It's beautiful. And let's enjoy it as it is now because it will end. Everything is in a cycle. Everything ends. Now here's a way of looking at that. And that is that don't look at it in the sense of everything is ending and that you're dead, but look at it from the sense of when you're still alive, before you die, right when you die, and as you die. Those are mind moments. How are you going to spend those mind moments? Are you ready? Not for death itself, But are you ready for the dying process?

**Speaker B:** I'm excited in the sense of like, it's almost already a thing that's already taking place. It's like, I feel like life, a lot of it is a memory that I'm just kind of working through. And like, you know, like working through these situations and these tendencies. And I guess like when I realized like when you love someone, like when you find that dearest, nearest you know, like the Buddha talks about the dearest of the dear, you know, it's like, because it's a different type of quality because you're like super in love and attached. And so it's how does that end, you know, like you can't believe it because it's so amazing and all. So, and I don't know, that's something more like, and you can't really think it. It's a feeling, like it's like something that works itself out.

**Speaker A:** Well, here's how it does work itself out, and it does it with feeling or thinking, Anapanasati. And that is that if you know in advance that when you lose something that is dear, that that will bring on grief, you can plan on it in advance and sort of recognizing, you know, it can be a dog or a girlfriend or a laptop or whatever that we have that we find is deer, it's good to occasionally have a thought about this laptop's going to die, that dog is going to die, that bird that Piti found the other day. I thought it was going to die that night, but it waited 4 days to die. She became quite attached to it, so I was very surprised that when the bird died, she took care of it herself. She didn't even have to come crying to me about the bird dying. But everything dies. The question is, are you ready for that to happen, even if what is dying is so dear to you that it's your own life itself? Yeah, we know that we're going to die. Plan on dying. Think about dying. Think about all the ways that you could die. You can brush aside all the instant deaths, like out of the blue, we're just sitting here and then a gun goes off and I'm dead. Or that a bomb blows up. No, think about it in the sense of having fallen out of an airplane.

**Speaker B:** You have time.

**Speaker A:** And we have time, right? Because almost all death has that time. The other possibility is dying in one's sleep, but even then, there is a dying process.

**Speaker B:** You should have been paying attention.

**Speaker A:** Right. That's the whole idea. Then a lot of people, the cowboys talk about that they want to die with their boots on. What does that mean? They want to die in action. They don't want to be sick in bed and dying from the sickness. If I'm going to get shot, let me not be lying in bed for days and days wounded and die. Let me go ahead and die right there on the battlefield with my boots on. Okay, that's one of the mentalities. And so we can play with this kind of stuff, recognizing that you're going to die. It's like everybody's— how are you going to do that? What preferences do you have? Because you don't have any preferences over whether you are going to die or not. For sure it's going to happen. How are you going to handle that? How you're going to breathe? What are you going to say?

**Speaker B:** It's similar to how I handled, I think, the inadequacy, because it's really that. It's really like people, I think, like with the— it's like you think you're going to lose everything, like you think you're going to lose all this stuff. But I think it hits you like— I don't think it hits people like until they die, because they don't have anything they love more than themselves when they're like when they're living, so they don't know how that feels.

**Speaker A:** So exactly. So, so let's deal now with the loss of things mentally before we actually lose them, so that when we do lose them, whether it's a laptop or a dog or your own life, you're ready to let it go. That's what I mean about how are you going to spend your last mind moments. How are you— are you going to spend it clinging to life Are you going to be spending your last moment, um, let us say, blaming your, uh, um, the, the guy who shot you or killed you? I'll see you in hell. Or, uh, we're going to spend our last mind moment angry. How are we going to spend our last mind moment?

**Speaker B:** I'm going to spend it like happily, beautiful, happy.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, let's spend right now happy because it might be our last one.

**Speaker B:** Anagami.

**Speaker A:** That's a good joke.

**Speaker B:** I know, right? That's like, I don't know how, like, how much appreciation I have. So much. Like, people say, like, oh, like, you know, like, I want 100% of my brain, I want 100% of— like, I really appreciate the fact that we have filters, like, now more than ever. Like, of course I appreciate, like, wow, if you didn't, you know, that. But like, the fact that we can even communicate right now is beyond incredible because that should not be in a way. In a way, it doesn't make sense, you know, that we're doing this.

**Speaker A:** Yes, not only the technology and the Zoom and whatnot, but the fact that we're actually just speaking to each other in concepts, but we're able to use those concepts in words to turn that into an experience for you now.

**Speaker B:** It's, well, I mean, yeah, look at what life is.

**Speaker A:** You're right, life is just the experience of it moment by moment. Here it is.

**Speaker B:** And words, I mean, like life as we know it usually is made up of what, like conventional reality is made up of just words, like sounds, you know, reactions to those sounds. And, um, yeah, it's crazy. I mean, that's, uh I mean, I'm sure you've been through that with the love thing in your life because you're old and, you know, and, you know, you— Yes, in fact, dealing with my mother's death in advance, literally years in advance, because she had advanced Alzheimer's.

**Speaker A:** Her old body was tough, but her mind was gone for about 10 years. There was nothing left of her mind. And in fact, when I would call her she would work herself up and feel bad. Oh, when are you coming home? I want to see you, and that kind of stuff. And she would ask 3 or 4 of the same questions over and over and over and again over a period of an hour. That's all she'd have. And I'd answer her question in great detail or in short, and then she'd come up with another question that had just been answered. There was nothing left of her mind but feelings. Yes. And so I decided that it would be better if I didn't even call her because all she does is get upset when I do. That when I'm not with her, she doesn't think about me at all. She's much better off without me. And so I was able to give up my mom years before she actually died.

**Speaker B:** That takes a lot, like, you know, like a lot. Like, it's crazy because I don't think people know how much that takes. But because, I mean, now you're like calm, but I'm sure at the time it took so much like out of you that, you know, it built you up.

**Speaker A:** Now, no, just one. No, just one thought at a time. Just one at a time. I can handle this. I can handle that. And so it was actually quite easy to let go because I only let go of a little bit at a time. Okay, one thought at a time, just one thought at a time. That's the old— that's the whole practice about Anapanasati, is just let go of it right now. Don't, don't keep it all built up so that it blows over or, or explodes, unless it's in doing it in joy, like you, to be overwhelmed with how marvelous things are.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like even things like that, you know, like not that, you know, that happened, but that you were able to see and, you know, even love your mom in a different way. And like, it's crazy because like there are so many things in life that you have to do that too. Like you have to let go even though you don't want to let go. You have to because it's the best thing to do. And I think that's probably the number one thing that we all— we just— that's the practice. You know, the things that cause you suffering, let them go. So, you know.

**Speaker A:** But the question is, do we have to let them go all of a sudden at the point of its death, or can we let it go little by little?

**Speaker B:** That's impossible. I mean, good luck. You know, that's really hard.

**Speaker A:** But a clear, a clear example of that with computers is backing up your drives. You got to keep things backed up because if you don't keep things backed up, then you're going to be in really great misery when you lose all the data of that tribe.

**Speaker B:** I feel like death or whatever, like death is similar to that, like letting go of all that, like cleaning out, like letting go. And it's like when you lose that déjà vu, We've talked about the sense of déjà vu being gone. That is crazy, because I used to think like that, that was, your life is just a mechanism or whatever. But then you told me to pay attention when déjà vu comes up, when these dreams, like these visions, like this kind of like, oh, this intuition that I dreamed this before, that I had this before. And one time I realized it's just like that, that there's I never had this before. That's the point. It's entering right now. Like, I realized it was like, oh, okay. But I know that probably doesn't make sense, but it doesn't have to. But yeah, it's just, I think it's crazy how much, and I'll be honest to you, of course I've been practicing and everything. But most of it has come from because of the practice. It's allowed me to retain what I'm going through without flipping out. So like, that's where most of it like kind of comes from, where it's like I went through all these things and did all the things that I always was scared of doing. And then it's like, oh, okay.

**Speaker A:** Like, you know, actually, I think the Westerners put far too much value on what we would call formal practice. Yeah, that, that really the one of the main values of formal practice, which you have obviously done, is to develop Sati, to remember to look so that when you're not doing formal practice, you continue to remember to look at what's going on. And that's where all the insights come from, is because now you're out there living your life and actually looking at what's going on and seeing it in a new way. And as you keep doing that over and over again, it begins to build a new habit as well as the insight, the sharpness of the insight grows so that the things that you used to see as Dukkha are now seen as not Dukkha, and other things that used to be seen as not Dukkha are now seen as Dukkha, because we're refining our understanding of the reality of things. And basically, there's actually only one insight. And there's only one insight. And what is that insight? Into what is the nature of Dukkha. Well, that's dissatisfaction.

**Speaker B:** It's conditional. That's the right thing. It's just you. It's just you're choosing it.

**Speaker A:** You're choosing it. Exactly. That's where it's all coming from, is our choice every time. And we choose it ignorantly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Other than wisely.

**Speaker B:** It's— it just makes you laugh most of the time.

**Speaker A:** It does. It does. It's so funny when we begin to see that. It's just so marvelous to recognize, you know, I've had a choice about how I felt all my life and I didn't know it. I thought I was supposed to feel the way you're supposed to feel in this situation.

**Speaker B:** It's so mind-blowing. I don't know, it's just like you realize it, you're like— and it's not even like a realization, it's like, you know how people meditate and we wait for this moment to arise and come down and grace us? But for me, it's like, oh, it's like waking up from from like a hangover, right? Like when, if you've ever drank before, like in your young days, like, you know, you wake up and you're like, wait, what? You're not like, how did I get here? You know, you know, you're like, you're like, oh, you know, it's, it's crazy. Or, you know, you, it's really like blacking out. It really is that ignorant state of you just kind of dissociate from reality. And people have that already, you know, as they grow up. All that tendency.

**Speaker A:** Actually, you could say that one of the places that that happens a lot is in business meetings, where people are not paying attention to what the meeting is going on. They're thinking about going home, they're thinking about how they like or dislike other people in the room and whatnot like that. And basically what happens in the business meeting, most of the people miss. Yeah, because they're not paying attention to what's happening in the business meeting. They're not only half paying attention to what's happening in their own mind, and so they're divided back and forth and back and forth. And so learning to focus on anything is a skill, to be able to apply the mind to something and let it stay there rather than jumping around so much.

**Speaker B:** And it's the way that a monk lives her or his life and the way that a layperson— I've realized how similar it is in the way, obviously, that we approach everything, obviously, because it's the same way. But it's funny because if a monk was in the world, like a fully ordained monk who you know, who is practicing the practice and is having insight and, you know, is fully developed in the practice. Like, flip that over. He lives in the world. All that is, is a person who's happy in the world with everything around them. And then you just put them in a forest and it's just a person that's happy without everything around them. It's just like, it's the same thing. Like, they're living their life having quality.

**Speaker A:** It really is an all attitude. The problem is, is that the way that we raise our children, very few people wind up naturally happy in adulthood. We all get indoctrinated into having the primary feelings of being bad feelings: greed, ill will, ignorantly. Yeah, we're taught to want and to want and to want. Instead of teaching the child to not be afraid, we teach the children to be afraid Because they've got to do what they're told to do. In fact, I've got an example of that, that when Mom or the teacher or I would talk really straight to Kitty, like she's done something wrong, pay attention to look at what we're doing, she would become afraid and start to cry, which meant then that Mom and the teachers are going to get angry at her, which means she's going to cry some more. And I kept telling her, Kitty, don't be afraid of Mom. Don't be afraid of her. And so then came along, it has to do with the dog. So the dog becomes a teacher of Piti. And this is what happened. The dogs are not allowed on the bed, but sometimes they do. And the game is, is that they only come on the bed when mom is not at home. If mom is at home, there's no way they'll get on the bed. But when dad's home, and in the bed, they'll get on the bed too, like early in the morning after mom goes to work. So that's the situation. So Kitty decides that she's going to take photos of the dogs to show mom that the dog has been on the bed. All right. And so she approaches the dog with this camera as if it were a stick or something. And now that has happened several times, I point out to Kitty, look how terrified Lucky is. And she's so terrified she can't even get off the bed, which is what she knows she's supposed to do, just like you do when you start to cry. You know what you can— you're supposed to do, but you're crying so hard and so afraid you can't do what you know needs to be done to get mom off your back, for instance. And she picked that up. She recognized that she was just behaving exactly the same way that the dog was behaving. Afraid. When the dog was afraid, the dog was too stupid while afraid to get off the bed. But if Mom is on the porch, if Mom comes into the house, the dogs are lickety-split off the bed. They know that she's coming, so they know how to get off the bed in a hurry. But when Kitty's approaching with the camera, they get really afraid. And Kitty learned that. In fact, I'd already told you about the story of the bird that the bird died and she was able to handle that without crying or being afraid or uptight about her little bird dying. The same way with her vaccine. She just got her vaccine, the first shot, the kids' vaccine. They've got them in Thailand now and she's had her first shot just today. And I asked her, how was it? Did you cry? No, I didn't cry.

**Speaker B:** That's amazing.

**Speaker A:** I can handle that. And so, yeah, I'm really pleased that the dogs were a teacher for her, so that we can learn to not be afraid. Because if we're afraid, we can't perform. We can't do anything when we're afraid. All we have is the adrenaline to get us into a fight or flight, to run away. Or to fight it, rather than having the wisdom and the presence of mind to take care of business. That happens, in fact, when people are getting fussed at by the boss. They either want to run away, they freeze, or they want to argue, when the boss is really— what he wants is for them to listen and learn.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's, uh, I think that's too— it's like humble, you know, you— it's like having a teacher and, um, and all that. And, um, I think like learning how to discipline yourself and all— it's part of, it's part of just, you know, learning how to be here now and not being here now.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. To not give in to those fears that we picked up in childhood.

**Speaker B:** It's like there was this guy, like a guy asked another man, he's like, he asked him, like the cliché question, it's like, my life, you know, I've done everything right and I practice and I've done it all and it's all good. And but yet, you know, somehow I still feel inadequate and all that. And he's like, well, just imagine, right? Like he put this whole example, like you just in a way of imagine if a whole army is coming to your village, a small village. And, you know, all you have is a small army and you have to protect your family and everything. And do you think that when you sit under a tree and you're waiting for the battle, are you going to think about all the things that you hate about yourself and all the things that you— are you really going to think about all the things that— no, on that last day, the only thing is going to be how you face that, how you face it, like how you are going to go out there and do it. Like, you will give it all. I mean, it might, you know, this is a crazy example, but you know what I mean?

**Speaker A:** Like, it's— I do exactly know what you mean, that in fact, we do not deal with the fear and think about, oh, poor me and my poor family and all of that kind of stuff. No, we stay focused on there's a job that has to be done here. Let's pay attention to what needs to be done. And so that's another example right there. So pretty heavy gross example, but that's exactly the same issue as the dog can't get off the bed.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and it's like the boots, uh, the cowboy by their bootstraps, uh, they want to die in the, in what they're doing. And it's like, or, or Master, uh, a Buddha Dassa, like, you know, how he died with— it's like, you know, uh, I don't need the helicopter, you know, I don't need the hospital, I'm here, I'm here, right here.

**Speaker A:** You remember that? Wow, I'm surprised.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, of course. I mean, that's so amazing.

**Speaker A:** It's a really It is a good story. It really is that he can handle— he can handle dying right here. He doesn't have to go flying in helicopter to die. He can do that right here.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like, you know, most people would like a ceremony, flowers, a chill, everything around, you know. Like, it's like, in reality, it's like that already happened. Like, you know, like, it— you don't need all that. It's already gone. Like, just— it's okay.

**Speaker A:** Like, you know, they don't have to celebrate my life or my death. I'm celebrating it right now myself. Having my own little celebration.

**Speaker B:** It's like it reminds me of that war, like the samurai, the warrior, and you know, and all that stuff, like how they were always like, there's a job to be done. You do not like, you are here, you know, you carry yourself with grace and composure. And you know, it's like, it doesn't mean you don't like feel anything, but you know, you feel and you move on.

**Speaker A:** But if you're doing that, you're feeling secure. Rather than afraid.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's like the Buddha, like he had this intensity about him, but he was still able to relate to everyone, welcome everybody in, and he wasn't like scaring people away with his, you know, like toughness.

**Speaker A:** Well, one example that we can use, the Pali word for fear is Abhaya, and that they have Abhaya, which is not fear, but it's been translated into English as fearlessness. And that is a confusing thing because fearlessness is actually what the warrior does as he's getting ready for battle, and he uses that fearlessness to cover up his fear. In other words, He is in courage, he has courage, he can go meet that danger. And there's a slight difference in the sense of, if that warrior felt safe and secure, he would not be putting on the armor to go to battle, he'd be preparing supper for the enemy to come as guest. He's not actually afraid at all. So, fearlessness is actually courage and the ability to go with it by pushing that fear down, to where the Buddha doesn't have that fear at all. He feels safe and secure, he knows that he can handle the situation easily. In fact, there's a Zen story about that, that the samurai general, was going through the area conquering villages, and he went into this one village and he went into the temple, and there all of the monks were bowing and scraping. All the big generals come with his warriors and his samurai sword. Everyone was bowing except for the abbot of the monastery who was just standing there watching what was going on. And the general saw him and marched up to him and he says, don't you know that I can pull this sword and cut you in half? 'in a single blow without blinking an eye.' The old abbot says, 'Don't you know, sir, that I can stand here and let you cut me in half without blinking an eye?' That's a way of coming back without fighting anything. And that general respected him for that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I can imagine. That's incredible. Like, that's incredible.

**Speaker A:** It's— that is— so that's not fearlessness. That's just no fear at all. I'm not afraid. Don't you know that I could just stand here and let you cut me in half? I'm not afraid of you.

**Speaker B:** And that's why they say the samurai he puts on a grave face before he has to go to battle because no samurai ever wants to go to battle. Like, there's no— like, because that inside, they don't— that's never needed to— it shouldn't have to be used.

**Speaker A:** And that's right. And in fact, that's why Buddhism kind of reformed Japan to turn the martial arts and the real Bushido and the wars in the 1700s for the Shogunate and all of that and turn that into Zen and the art of whatever martial art you're talking about, Zen and the art of archery, or Zen and the art of sword making, or Zen and the art of swordsmanship, or that in fact the Goju kind of martial art that I learned was very strongly mentally oriented, that it's the mind It's not just the strength or the repetition or doing the work. It's the mind state that we get in so that we can handle anything. The mind state of being right here now. You can imagine, in fact, two people, never mind their training skills, but two people in a fight with each other. The one who is thinking about his mom is the one who's going to get hit. And the one who's paying attention to what's going on is the one who's going to be able to defend himself. Either verbally or mentally or physically, because he's here now.

**Speaker B:** What was the name of that? Goju. Goju.

**Speaker A:** The word go, it means strong, and then ju means soft. So it's a hard-soft system. Okay. And you heard the word jiu-jitsu, and you know that jiu-jitsu is using the other— the opponent's work against him. Well, this is what Goju has in it too, but it also has a great deal of strength that what we do is we make the arms very strong and hold it very tough to get those on. The way that they teach it is, is that if you hit something really hard with your arm and your muscles are not tight, you could break your arm. But if your muscles are really tight and firm, then they will operate as a shock absorber so that you might get bruised, but you don't break your arm.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. That way, now you can go out and you can use that part of your arm as a weapon. Yeah, I see what you're saying. Because you've got the strength built into it, because this is a much better weapon, especially for blocking, because you can go like that and actually break this guy's arm who's punching out like that. But he's punching So he's got a different muscle system going. And when I take my tight muscles and bang into his arm, I can literally break his arm. I've actually knocked a gun out of a cop's hand by doing that. Oh, for real?

**Speaker B:** Wow.

**Speaker A:** For real.

**Speaker B:** That's like— I never heard of Goju, but that's cool. I never heard of that type of martial arts.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Well, it's from Okinawa, but it's definitely Japanese. It is definitely Zen.

**Speaker B:** That's so cool. Like, it's definitely interesting how all this translates, all of these martial arts and all these arts translate to this internal, like we can internalize it and just make it something like resonates with this practice and so forth. But it's very interesting.

**Speaker A:** And it has two main components to it. Speed and attitude, which are exactly the two components that we need for Anapanasati.

**Speaker B:** It always goes back to that. Every skill, everything. It's like every true skill, I think especially physical skill, is so related to that. It's related to that mental attitude because there's going to be pain. There's going to be a lot of pain because you're growing. You're going to be growing and changing and so forth. So it's interesting how that works. But yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well, Dennis, I tell you what, we've been all over the place with our Dharma talk today, and I really enjoyed it coming into that point that you started with of being here now, being in the present, being in our senses and watching what we're doing and seeing what's going on. And that is actually liberating because we recognize that our conceptualized world is upside down to what actual reality is.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's beautiful.

**Speaker A:** It is so beautiful just to pay attention. This is so nice. And I am really pleased to see you again. Gosh, it's been months since we've seen each other, and I'm really pleased at your progress. Congratulations, you're really making good progress.

**Speaker B:** Actually, it's been almost 2 years. Yeah, it has. Yeah, I know, me too. I'm like, whoa, how has it been this long? But it almost feels like we— I never, I never nothing ever. Like, I never stopped talking to you, right?

**Speaker A:** We're still right here, right now. Here we are. And I'm really pleased to see you. I hope that next time you call, it's not 2 years from now. I hope that you call.

**Speaker B:** No, I just needed that time to grow.

**Speaker A:** Well, by the way, um, we are doing a whole lot of stuff now with Sangha of the students that are practicing, are learning about each other. Now I invite you to look In fact, you already know about the YouTube videos.

**Speaker B:** I've seen the UK one. Do you have a US one? Like, is it— does it matter?

**Speaker A:** I've forgotten where you are.

**Speaker B:** I'm in Florida, United States.

**Speaker A:** You're in Florida. That's right. That's right. That's right. Around Orlando area. That's right. Oh, I remember now. Okay. So yeah, there is a Sangha UK and the Sangha US, the one on Sangha US, we meet on Friday evenings. Your time would be 9 o'clock on Friday evening, which is 9 AM on Saturday morning here. And last time we had 14 on.

**Speaker B:** Oh wow, okay, that'd be fun. That'd be fun to talk.

**Speaker A:** So I invite you to come on. And also both the UK and the Sangha US have threads where people are talking about their practice. I mean, we're really building Sangha. People are helping each other. Yeah, you don't need me so much anymore.

**Speaker B:** We've got to— I still want to talk to you.

**Speaker A:** You can. You were the one who didn't call for 2 years. That's funny.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So I invite you to check it out, and maybe we can see you on the Sangha call. You can just hang out or whatever.

**Speaker B:** Definitely, yeah, I'd love to meet new people and, you know, talk to the people, like the people, you know, talk to all my friends.

**Speaker A:** Excellent, excellent. All right, well, we'll see you soon.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, Dhammarato. Uh-huh.

**Speaker A:** Happy to see you today. So happy.

**Speaker B:** Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and Dennis (Speaker B) is a wide-ranging, conversational exploration of core Buddhist insights gained through meditation practice. Here is a summary of the key themes:

### Core Theme: Waking Up from an "Upside-Down" Reality
The talk centers on the profound shift in perception that comes with dedicated practice. Dennis describes realizing that his previous way of seeing life was completely "upside down." Dhammarato identifies this as the **ignorance (avijja)** described in the Second Noble Truth—the root cause of suffering, where we are attracted to things based on a fundamental misunderstanding of reality.

### Key Insights Discussed:

1.  **Everything is Already Okay:** The central, liberating insight is that reality, just as it is, is already complete and satisfactory. The problem is our conditioned mind, which constantly feels a sense of lack ("I'm not good enough," "I need something").
2.  **Letting Go of Childhood Drivers:** They discuss how we operate from unconscious, rule-based "drivers" or tendencies formed in childhood (e.g., "Hurry Up," "Be Perfect," "Be Strong"). Spiritual growth is a rapid "growing up," where we put away these childish ways of thinking and reacting.
3.  **The End of Striving and the Rise of Ease:** True practice leads to the understanding that you cannot "make" reality better than it already is. This ends the exhausting inner striving. Life becomes effortless, without a sense of being "driven." As Dhammarato summarizes: *"Everything becomes really easy... we're not in a hurry. We're not trying to be tough. We're not trying to get it right. Just everything is okay."*
4.  **Being Present in the Senses:** True "being here now" means abiding in direct sensory experience, not in conceptual thought about the past or future. This is where peace and clarity are found.
5.  **Skillful Relationship with Life and Death:** The practice equips you to handle all of life, including loss and death. By learning to let go of attachments little by little in daily life, you prepare for the ultimate letting go. They discuss the ideal of facing death—and every moment—with composure, happiness, and without fear.
6.  **From Complexity to Simplicity:** The Dhamma is ultimately simple: there is suffering, it has a cause (craving/ignorance), it can end, and there is a path to its end. The complexity is in our own ignorant habits. The single great insight is into the **conditional and chosen nature of our dissatisfaction**.
7.  **Formal and Informal Practice:** While formal meditation (Anapanasati) is valuable for developing mindfulness (*sati*), the most important insights come from applying that "remembering to look" to everyday life—in relationships, work, and challenges.

### Memorable Analogies and Stories:
*   **The Motorbike:** The feeling of control and exhilaration on a motorbike is used as a metaphor for the meditative state of being in effortless, joyful control of the present moment.
*   **Childhood Drivers:** Using concepts from Transactional Analysis to explain our conditioned psychological patterns.
*   **The Samurai and the Abbot:** A Zen story illustrating the difference between fearlessness (courage that overcomes fear) and true fearlessness (the utter absence of fear born of wisdom).
*   **Backing Up Your Data:** Preparing for death is likened to routinely backing up a computer—it's a gradual, wise process that prevents catastrophe.
*   **Sea Foam:** The mind is compared to bubbling sea foam—insubstantial and ever-changing, which means we are not stuck with any particular thought pattern.

### Conclusion: A Celebration of Waking Up
The conversation concludes with mutual appreciation. Dhammarato congratulates Dennis on his clear progress, which is marked by a deep relaxation into the natural ease and beauty of life as it is. The talk is ultimately a celebration of waking up from ignorance, putting aside childish conditioning, and resting in the peaceful, amazing reality of the present moment.

### Metaphors and Stories

This conversation is rich with metaphors and stories used to illustrate Buddhist principles and personal growth. Here is a breakdown of the primary ones:

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **"Everything was upside down" / "Right-side up"**
    *   **What it illustrates:** The fundamental Buddhist concept of *avijjā* (ignorance). Our conventional, desire-driven view of reality is inverted. True understanding ("waking up") is seeing things as they truly are—already complete and "okay."

2.  **"Growing Up" / "Putting away childish things"**
    *   **What it illustrates:** The spiritual path as a rapid maturation process. The speaker describes being emotionally "stuck" at a child's age (6, 7, 13) for decades, governed by childish rules (jealousy, anger, dependency). Practice allows one to quickly "grow up" to one's actual age, letting go of those immature mental patterns. This references the Biblical quote (1 Corinthians 13:11) about putting away childish things.

3.  **"Drivers" (from Transactional Analysis)**
    *   **What it illustrates:** The unconscious, compulsive energies that motivate suffering. The talk lists them as:
        *   **Hurry Up:** Leads to anxiety, rushing.
        *   **Be Strong:** Leads to bullying, toughness, power trips (exemplified by Putin).
        *   **Be Perfect:** Leads to striving, never feeling "good enough."
    *   The goal of practice is to be free from these "drivers."

4.  **The Body as an Antenna / Vibration Sensor**
    *   **What it illustrates:** Deep, intuitive awareness beyond the five senses.
    *   **Supporting Stories:**
        *   **Elephants:** Feeling herd vibrations through the ground from miles away.
        *   **Mechanics:** Diagnosing a hard drive's health by feeling its vibrations with the hand.
        *   **Motorcyclists:** Feeling the bike's condition and performance through vibration, creating a sense of unified control.

5.  **"Pushing Against a Mental Ramp"**
    *   **What it illustrates:** The wasted effort and struggle of living by internalized, impossible rules (like "I'm not good enough"). It's compared to a football player pointlessly pushing against a fixed training ramp—exerting immense energy but going nowhere.

6.  **Thoughts as Bubbles or Sea Foam**
    *   **What it illustrates:** The insubstantial, impermanent nature of thoughts. With practice, solid, oppressive thoughts are seen as mere bubbles forming and popping. Since they are not solid, we can "change the bubble's color"—choose not to follow the habitual thought groove.

7.  **"Flipping Out" vs. "Flopping"**
    *   **What it illustrates:** The habitual (ignorant) reaction to life is to "flip out" with struggle, resistance, and drama. Wisdom teaches that you can simply "flop"—relax into acceptance, allowing things to be as they are.

8.  **"Backing Up Your Drives"**
    *   **What it illustrates:** The importance of preparing for loss (of possessions, loved ones, or life itself) through mental preparation (non-attachment). Just as you back up data to avoid misery when a hard drive fails, you "back up" your peace of mind by contemplating impermanence.

### **Key Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Samurai and the Zen Abbot:**
    *   **Story:** A conquering general threatens an abbot, saying he could cut him in half without blinking. The abbot replies, "And I could stand here and *let you* cut me in half without blinking."
    *   **Purpose:** To distinguish between **fearlessness** (courage that overcomes fear) and **true absence of fear** (the security and peace that comes from deep understanding and acceptance).

2.  **Putin and the Motorbike of Ukraine:**
    *   **Story:** Vladimir Putin's aggression is framed as a desperate attempt to control "the motorbike called Ukraine" to maintain an inner sense of being "in charge," stemming from his own unresolved fear and need for control.
    *   **Purpose:** To show how the "Be Strong" driver manifests on a global scale, and how external control is a futile substitute for internal peace.

3.  **The Daughter, the Dogs, and the Camera:**
    *   **Story:** The speaker's daughter (Kitty) frightens the dogs by approaching them with a camera. The dogs freeze in terror, just as Kitty freezes and cries when scolded. This parallel teaches her about how fear paralyzes and prevents wise action.
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate how we can learn from simple life observations to see our own patterns of fear and reaction, and to cultivate the ability to "handle it" without freezing.

4.  **The Death of Ajahn Buddhadāsa:**
    *   **Story:** The revered Thai monk Buddhadāsa, when offered a helicopter to the hospital at the end of his life, refused, saying essentially, "I don't need it. I can die right here."
    *   **Purpose:** To exemplify the ultimate preparedness and peace that comes from fully accepting impermanence, contrasting with the common desire for ceremony, struggle, or avoidance at death.

5.  **The Illusion of a 24-Hour Day:**
    *   **Story:** A scientific explanation that Earth's full rotation is actually 23 hours and 56 minutes, but we add 4 minutes to align with the sun's position, creating the "day."
    *   **Purpose:** To demonstrate that even our most basic conventions (like time) are constructed, relative, and not ultimately solid—mirroring the constructed nature of our mental reality.

### **Recurring Imagery & Concepts**
*   **Being Here Now / In the Senses:** Contrasted with being lost in conceptual thought (past/future).
*   **Already Patient / Already Enough:** True patience is not waiting *for* something, but resting in the understanding that nothing is lacking.
*   **Amazement / Beauty:** The recurring emotional tone of waking up to reality is wonder, beauty, and humor at the obviousness of what was previously missed.
*   **The Simplicity of Dhamma:** Framed as a simple choice between *dukkha* (suffering) and its cessation, obscured by the complexity of our ignorance.

These metaphors and stories collectively paint a picture of the spiritual path as a shift from a life of driven, childish struggle (upside-down) to one of relaxed, amazed, and mature openness to the present moment (right-side-up).
