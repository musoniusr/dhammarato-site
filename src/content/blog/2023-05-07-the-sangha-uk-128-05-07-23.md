### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Full house, 11. That's temporary. Okay, so guys, welcome to, um, the UK Sangha. It's, um, uh, Sunday afternoon in early May. What is this, the 5th or the 6th? Something like that. The 7th. Wow, numbers fly, don't they? All right, so, um, The thing about that is, is that it's the numbers that fly on your calendar, but people mistake that and think that it's days. But every day is a day, just that they're all the same. Every day is a holiday, and they're quite holy, but the numbers keep flying by. Such is the nature of the mind. We can't tell the difference between a day and a number. We're going to talk a little while today about what is the mission of the Open Sangha Foundation. And the mission basically is to unify Buddhism in the West. A pretty lofty goal to unify it, because the Westerners already come with a divided, divisive mentality. And a lot of people think that the Mahayana is different than the Theravada or the Zen or whatever like that, and they sort of put them into various buckets. DJ, good to see you.

**Speaker B:** Good to see you, Dhammarato, and the.

**Speaker A:** Rest of the crew. So the Western mentality is that these things are all different because Christianity is all broke up. And so we would think that Buddhism is all broke up too. In fact, no. What happens with Buddhism, and has happened historically in Asia, was that the actual teachings of the Buddha got transmitted to different places, in kind of bits and pieces, always just enough to make it work. Zen's got all they need to make Zen work, and they've had Zen masters for centuries and centuries, and we know all about it. They've got a huge, interesting lineage and a whole lot of jokes around it. And so, whatever they're doing, they're doing it right, until Zen gets to the United States or in the West someplace, and then all of a sudden it's the Westerners who think that they're doing it— in fact, they force themselves to do it exactly right, and that's the problem, because Zen is not. 'Exactly right,' it's actually exactly nothing. And that's hard when we've got the idea that we've got to get things right. So, it's also been said, by the way, that the Theravada who study Zen, they know Zen better than the Zen masters. They may not be able to practice it yet, but they certainly know it. Why? Because the whole quality and everything in Zen can be found in the Suttas. So the teachings of the Suttas got there, but the Suttas themselves didn't. The problem is that in the West, it all comes from lay people, not monks. Monks didn't come like they did all over Asia. The monks spread the Buddha, and they did it in a family kind of way. They traveled in groups. And this was how Buddhism was spread. In the West, it's spread by books, by internet, and by sometimes celebrities, rather than the actual real Dhamma. And so that's what gives the idea that if we can bring all of those together, we can bring them back so that the teaching of the Buddha actually becomes quite effective No matter which cultural baggage you want to carry along, you'll eventually drop that baggage, and then you're actually just in the Dhamma, or the Dharma— put an R in it if you like, I don't care. So that's at the top scale. At a little bit lower down in the structure, because I'm just giving you the top idea, but in there's deeper into the structure of Well, when someone comes, let us say, to the website, there's a wide variety of people with a wide variety of experiences with Buddhism. One of the things for sure is they probably have heard about Buddhism or they wouldn't be on the site, so we don't have to go to that level. But we may in fact put some basic stuff about the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Noble Path. But we do want to make distinctions between new students, old students, want-to-be teachers, actual teachers, teachers that charge nothing, teachers that do it for free, teachers that are ordained. This would be the various strata. And then we're going to collect all of these people who sign in and give us their information, the ability to contact each other either through comments, messages, or emails. We'll also allow everybody to have 1, 2, or 3 photos and that kind of thing, so that we get a massive amount of information about a massive amount of people. And then we can do searches like, I want everybody who knows anything about Zen who lives in California, and it will give you all of that data. And so the point then is, is that what we're going to be looking for And as a project that actually costs money, is that I want to start supporting people who are afraid, but do want to leave the lay life, but they don't know how to do it, because they have to have money. And there's a kind of a big transition that happens between, let us say, living the ordinary life, and living a life of ease and comfort. On the cheap. And that's what we're recommending. But some people need support, support like with plane tickets, support like— in fact, my ideal would be that instead of all of the guys getting on a jet plane and coming to Thailand, is to people start going all over the various wats in the West. Go introduce yourselves, see what's happening there. Not just wats in the sense of Thai Laos, Cambodia, but whatever is there available. So that if you're into Theravada, go visit the Zen Center, go visit the Mahayana, move around, find out what's going on, network, so that we can begin to get to find these guys who actually do want to ordain, and they can audition then on the website. Of who is willing to support me at $5 a month or $10 a month, and let me go and live in Wat Greensboro. Or maybe another way of saying it is, the guy probably won't have much need for money. He probably already owns a car, and that's OK if he already owns it. In fact, probably all the physical goods that he owns, he could probably pack into his car and then go live in the wat with the car in the parking lot. He doesn't have to travel much, but then if he starts to teach and starts to get moving around in the neighborhood, then he'll need a little traveling money. But the idea then is that if we can get Westerners to move into the various wats all over the place, and make friends, by the way, with the abbot, no matter what tradition it's in, but learn from the monks, because these monks have been into Buddhism their whole lives. Doesn't matter what tradition he's in, he's in it, and lay people are not. And so lay people cannot help lay people in some of the things that need to be helped, and monks can't help lay people in other things. And so to get well-rounded, we actually need to spend some time with monks. But here's the point: if you can move into the wat and hang out there, don't have to work anymore because you've got your food and your board paid for by the wat— they'll take care of you. Maybe we want to make a donation to the wat on your behalf also to make sure that everything is hunky-dory in that right. And so then the abbot will make a plan on— well, now we can teach meditation in English here at this place. And so once a week we'll start having meditation classes, and then maybe after a while we can have a weekend retreat. It'll have 10 or 15 people to come do an actual retreat at the Wat, where the Asian people are normally feeding. But there will be some expenses in those retreats, so that the Open Sangha Foundation will be willing to pay for the retreats, so that the people who are participating in the retreat will learn about generosity, and then they will start to donate to Open Sangha Foundation on their own behalf. And so this whole thing will grow. But that's where we're looking for the money, is we're looking for money to support people. Then in fact, if anybody actually ordains, they will need very little from us after that. Because in the Asian community, we'll take care of all the needs. I've been around Asians. I know that especially in the West, they're very protective about their monks, even Westerners. They become family members. They're well-loved. And this is what the word Sangha is really all about. Sangha means friendship. It means having close friends that are nobly minded, the noble Sangha. Well, you see, the Thai Sangha of monks, most of the time and in most places, is actually quite noble, impressively so. They're very, very well-behaved and very, very jolly old guys, really worth spending time with, just by letting the Dharma soak in without having been spoken, but in fact that's what happened to me in Thailand, was Sirachanpo did not know English very well in 1984-85 when I was there, but he sure knew how to teach the Dhamma in very few words. So the Westerners need to be around old masters like that, and the United States and other places are full of them. Why? Because the Thai people, the Asian people in the West When they go monk-shopping in their home country to bring a monk back to the U.S. to start a wai, they know what they're looking for, don't they? One thing is, they don't want young monks, they want old monks. Another thing is, if a monk really wants to come to the United States, they'll reject him for that reason. They want to find monks who don't want to come, and then cajole them into doing it. Because the guy who wants to come to the West has got some interest in the West, and therefore he will probably get here and after a year or two will disrobe. And now he's got, you know, he's got his whole body in the door by then. And so for that reason they've had that, is that they don't want monks like that. They want top quality, and they've got them. More than likely you can find a wat that's quite beneficial for you, even if they believe things that you don't believe— superstitions and whatnot like that. There's a lot of wats in the U.S. that, especially in the community of Thai, they all know about Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. He is standard literature now in Thailand. But many of the Lao wats haven't heard about Bhikkhuni Buddhadasa, but they sure know how to understand the Dhamma and to practice it and become noble. That Bhikkhu Buddhadasa did not have a one-upmanship on nobility, that it's common. The only people who don't know it are the Western Buddhists. So, this is the way, is to introduce the noble Dhamma, of the monks into the West, so that people can get a good education, whether they ordain or not, is irrelevant. It's got its benefits and not. And in fact, a good way of looking at it is, sometimes you be a monk, you pretend to be a monk, you act like a monk; sometimes you ordain and actually become a monk, and then you can disrobe again. This is one of the most important One of the main qualities that distinguishes us, the Asian community, from the Western community, is that the Western community, the culture, is within the Catholic Church. Once you become an acolyte, you're either going to fail or you're going to ordain. Once you ordain, you're either going to die in the churchyard or you're going to be excommunicated. Those are the only two options. But within Buddhism, it's a swinging door. I see the gates to the Wat are always wide open, but if I was going to put doors on it, I'd put saloon doors, you know, out of the Old West, where these doors go back and forth, and they'll go either way, right? So you can just roll over and then come back. Then, in fact, in the time of the Buddha, there was one story of a guy who ordained 7 times because his family needed him on occasion to go and help them with the plants. Now monks don't cut plants. We don't like to cut grass. So sometimes the family needs them, and so they will disrobe and go home and live the lay life. For a few months or longer, and then come back and robe up again, and they're welcome, happily welcome, glad to see you back. And so this is the way that we're thinking about opening the doors of Sangha to the Western community, so that we can see each other as a family, a community of friends, where we'll be welcome. Wherever we go, because we come with an open heart and a clean mind. So this is what the Open Sangha Foundation is. And you know, there are actually a lot of websites out there that are promoting various things. There's huge communities that are associated with Buddhist ethics, or not just Buddhist ethics, but Asian religions in general. Primarily that happens because the teachers are not quite ready to be teachers. Those guys who want to be the teachers and found some big Zendo or whatever, in whatever country, if they were actually ordained and living as monks for a while, they would know what kind of relationship to have with women and with people. And then they could come back and they could keep their mind and their hands clean while they're teaching the Dharma, rather than having all these scandals. And I don't want to start talking about all the scandals I know, but Buddhism is as scandal-ridden as Christianity. And why is because the teachers that are teaching the Buddhism are no more mentally clean than the Christian preachers. That's just the facts of life. What we can actually do about that, though— see, Christianity has absolutely no, absolutely no solution to that problem on a mass scale. But within Buddhism, we do on a mass scale. There's about 500 Watts, I predict, in the United States. A couple years ago, when I was talking to Acharn Reet in Wat Attham Mayatharama in Seattle, he said that currently there were more than 200 Thai Watts. Now that's amazing, because all the Thai people who got into the United States got there on their own. But the other Asians, by the millions we're talking about, millions of Laotians, millions of Vietnamese, millions of Cambodians, were in the refugee camps, and finally in the '80s they went to the And that's why there are so many temples, so many wats, with a lot of monks. When I was there 15 years ago in North Carolina, there were more than 40 Theravada monks and a good smattering of Vietnamese. The Vietnamese are actually quite gushy because the government 50 years ago forced Theravada and Mahayana to merge. Which was the best thing that could happen to them. So in the U.S., I see both Mahayana and Theravada monks living in the same wat, in the Vietnamese tradition, and they're welcoming to both sides of it too. So this is the way that we want to look at it, and there's ample opportunity with 500 wats. If we had one guy in each one of those wats, that means that We could have 500 retreats every month. We can handle 5,000 people almost free of charge, because it's all done by joyous giving, and it doesn't cost anybody much of anything, with the understanding of paying it forward. We pay for the first retreat, and then we say to the folks, "Hey, if you got any value out of this retreat," why don't you help pay for the next one, so that other people can benefit? And so we begin to pay things forward. This is how I, in fact, I think of it with Ajahn Po. I could never return, I could never pay him back what he has given me, but I have to pay it forward to you guys. So take it as a gift. If it's well received, then I will be quite joyful. And this is what we need to do, is continue with that tradition of paying it forward and doing it in a sense of community and harmony. And I think that eventually, with that kind of thing happening, it might in fact have some political influence on the United States. And then the step after that is destruction and despair, like Christians are going through right now. So everything goes through a cycle. But this is the beginning of this one, because other than that, Buddhism is going to stay in the state that it's in now and only get worse because of the influx of millions of people. Basically due to AI. In the next 10 to 15 years, the whole planet is going to go through major revolutions about employment, because all the machines will be doing everything. What does that leave us? Well, to me, that's a grand opportunity to practice. No place to go and nothing to do, we'll just sit here and have fun. Sit within a community, have lunch together, and everything's fine. Go to sleep on the floor, and we're good to go. But humanity is not going to do that. They're going to be out there with their pickaxes and shovels and all kinds of stuff. In fact, I think, no, that's the wrong era. They're out there in America with their AK-47s and their Glocks. And in fact, they're already out there. So this is what happened when things begin to fall apart. But out of that falling apart, out of the death of the society that we're having now, that's going to take a few years, there is the possibility of rebirth as an open Sangha, so that people communicate and get along with each other in a friendly way. We're not afraid of each other anymore. I mean, almost all people, when they're attacked or they attack someone, is because they're afraid that if they don't do it first, they'll be the victim. And so, instead of, let us say, preemptive strikes, we have preemptive hugs, and everybody gets along, if we can train enough people to be able to do that. And I've got already all the teachers we need, more than enough teachers. Where's the students? The students are all afraid that they can't afford, or they won't be able to— I mean, at one time I estimated that my affiliation with Buddhism has cost me more than $10 million in lost salaries. I didn't even miss it! But in fact, I feel wealthy, and if I'd have kept all of that money, I would have spent it and felt I felt poor, but now I feel really wealthy. And so, if you have that feeling of wealth and generosity, then we don't harm anybody. We harm people out of fear. So, we have to teach each other how to not be afraid of each other, and then humans can be more like, what is it, the lobos, rather than chimpanzees. Chimpanzees are at each other's throat all the time. And the Nanobos, every time they have an argument, it ends in sex, generally right there on the spot. Now, I'm not predicting free sex for humanity, I'm predicting free wisdom instead, because that's what humans are capable of, of being able to get along with each other wisely, intellectually. So let's put this mission statement version to a rest. Does anybody have any questions about it? David, what do you think?

**Speaker C:** Oh yes, sounds very good. I just Because I just came to Thailand, so it's not like I can do much to support the spread of Buddhism in the West, I feel, being here.

**Speaker A:** Well, I would see you as one of the candidates for our support. Okay. Mm-hmm. So that you can Live the life of Riley. Actually, I've seen actual episodes of The Life of Riley. I live a whole lot better than Riley did in that TV series. So anyway, this is the point that I've met many guys already who would love to take the leap. I've had several women who were also looking for it. That in fact that leap that we're talking about is that which is done not in faith, but in confidence that we can do this. And changing one's lifestyle into the Dhamma is a pretty good working definition of what it means by a stream-enterer. You just jump in. You start living the Dharma. That's what's important. Making money is not important anymore. Why? Because always I feel unhappy and miserable, fighting with my teammates and fighting with the boss, fighting with the bank, fighting with the SEC. Oh, I got $10 million, of course I'm going to have a battle with the SEC. And it's an unhappy lifestyle, and people don't know that. But if we can get a group of people, a larger group, who learn how to live with each other in a harmonious way, then that mentality will start to grow. It's noble, and we know that it's higher quality. My mom said something like that. She was a Southern Baptist, I mean, right down to the core. She went to— I started to say lived in— she lived in many Baptist churches, more so than at home. The old story is, is that we went to the church every time the door opened. Well, my mom had the key, and so did my dad. So that's the kind of background that I had. So when I get into Buddhism and other things like that, I go into it 25-year-long dialogue with my mother. And I can tell for sure that I won that dialogue with her, because one of the things she said, among other things, is that she can see for sure that the lifestyle and the way that we live is a higher quality than top-notch in Christianity. The preachers, no, the Buddhist monks, we have it, and The word "monk" is a bad translation, it gives people the wrong idea of being monkish. No, we're Bhikkhus, we're chattering monkeys sometimes. And so, that whole quality of being able to change back and forth, so that we can experience it that way, allows us then to live in the world the way that my mother would have hoped and expected that all of the preachers and everyone that she knew in the Baptist Church would live, could live, but don't. And the way that Buddhism is now, that I just mentioned, that, wow, it's so many scandals. You'd hope that the scandals had died with Chuladasa, but I hear they haven't. And those stories get retold over and over again, so it's kept alive. But if we can find a more noble way of teaching the Dharma, so that we're not dependent upon, or let us say, putting ourselves into the guru position of having young women love and adore us, which is what happens with every preacher and every guru, but not the Buddhist monk, because of the training. Basically, in fact, you could say that most of the training that the Thai monks get about that is from the Thai women. The Thai women are the ones who train the monks, in the sense that if the monk does something wrong and the Thai women know what the rules are, she'll make a point of it, because this is a matriarchal society. And so, the Thai women keep the monks straight, as well as they know not to touch the monks, not to go near the monks, to leave the monks alone and expect the monks to leave them alone. And after years of training of that, that's probably what we're going to do even if we begin to teach in the Watts and have young women come by. But if we go buy a building and then set up shop there, when those young women come by to that building, there may be a bed in the back. And now we're back into the same mess that Buddhism is in, that Christianity is in, that we don't have that noble attitude. And the same thing goes with money, in fact that's the bigger issue, it's not the sex, it's the money. Because Buddhism has, I think because of its association more with psychotherapy, that Buddhism, by the way, in America, religion doesn't stand a chance, that all of those Asian Watts are unique in and of themselves, and Westerners don't go there except maybe for tourism. So the Asian Watts are, you know, sort of over there someplace in the mind of most Westerners, but we can in fact go in and make that connection. The monks would really love it. The lay people would love it. But the one who is afraid to go is good old yours truly. I'm afraid to go to the Wat. Until we get an organization going which invites us, go! We can look up on the index, we're going to get every Wat that we can to sign up, get their information, so that we can pinpoint them on the Google Map. And give everybody every opportunity to find local places and go see what's there, and then write it up for us so that everybody knows, and then we can start to have an idea of recommended places. And so we can find a way of getting this. Right now we're in a great deal of darkness about it, but the possibility is organization. Hey, everybody else uses computers. The banks use it, government uses it. Buddhists could use computers too and have fun at it. So does anybody have any questions? We've been going here— I mean, this is only half a story, and I mean half an hour rather, and I'm running it. Yes. Yes, Susan.

**Speaker D:** Where are the women going to fit into this? I say that very lightheartedly, but I'm only joking.

**Speaker A:** Excellent answer, excellent answer. In the same watch that the men would do it, because the women actually, the Asian women in the community, run the place. And we would expect to have women in the retreats. That in fact, the only issue that I can see is that most of the smaller wats don't have room for the women because there's not enough women there to have. But we're going to fix that too. That's not chauvinism, that's just a matter of availability.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And if you start hanging around and make friends with the old Asian women at any wat, they'll find a room for you. That if you— if the women go to the monk and ask about it, he's going to get all flustered and bothered because women are not supposed to come to him for that kind of stuff. But that's the— but But in the Western mentality, "Oh, well, he's the boss, I've got to go to the boss to get this kind of problem fixed." And so, there's part of the miscommunication. Thanks for asking this question, Susan. Just because there's not so many, and I will tell you what, part of the reason why men are so into spirituality is because they are so into suffering and Dukkha. And they know it. But I would say offhand that women are more balanced, and therefore they don't wind up needing. A clear example to me is that the nurses do all the dirty work for the surgeons, and the surgeons do nothing but take their little scalpel and cut a little bit, and hold it up in the air for everybody to see, while all the women are doing all the work. Now tell me an industry where that doesn't happen, especially in the old days with the typists. You know, the secretaries, they ran the show.

**Speaker D:** I think there's a difference as well going on, well, here today as well, because I've noticed that basically Sanghas that are trying to build up that depend on IT and using computers, women do do it, I do it, But the women tend to want to have that Sangha face-to-face.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's exactly right. That in fact, we're actually to the point of asking the question, are we ready to actually have a Zoom account so that we can handle 300? I don't see us using Zoom like that. I would say that we would be more likely to use it the way that people use Skype and just 2 people get into contact, maybe 3 or 4. This Skype to me looks like a very good platform for this kind of thing. I mean, we're on Skype now, it works fine. But video calls are something that we would encourage. That's in fact something— thank you for asking that question, because what we'll do is give on our signup form, a place to put a Skype address so that they can be found. That this is very, very much in a way kind of like LinkedIn for reality. And so, yeah, having video calls and contacts and all of that kind of stuff. And the best part about it is, is that it actually solves the problem of it being too big and too wide, never mind how much wonderful it is, world. It's too big and it's too wide and there's too many people, but the internet and the ability to gather data about people makes it a whole lot easier to do. This project that we're talking about now could not happen until now. This is a project that couldn't happen in the 1990s or before, or even in the '90s. So this is something new, and so who knows what kind of technology. This database may be hooked up to where all I have to do is say, "Susan," and wherever you are, you'll say, "Yeah, I'm here." Because we got an implant and we're wired to Elon satellites, and all we have to do is have that connection. And that's what the database is for, is to help people get connected with each other so that distance be not a barrier. And I really like your idea, yeah, we're going to do availability of a lot. But in fact, here's the idea with that too, and that is that when guys are ready to make a big leap into it, one of the things that we all want to do along the way is teach the Dhamma. Even the beginners that are getting results for it, they want to fix their family right away. They don't have the skills yet, but they know what's wrong with them, they can certainly tell that. Diagnose correctly, they just can't fix it. But we're all wanting to do that, to diagnose what the problem is and to get it fixed. This is— I mean, we're kind of positioned, each one of us, it's built into us as a package, and that's something that's beneficial. So there will come a time when people actually are willing to teach the Dharma. Let's do that on Zoom, and we'll get other teachers and other students to listen to them. And we don't even have to critique, because anyone who gives a Dharma talk, they want to go back in their mind and review it and second-chance it. It's always the point of, did I tell the truth according to what I know for sure is correct, or am I just repeating hearsay from some Joe Blog Zen master down the street? We start to put together where our sources were, so that we get real confident about what we know and why we know it. And this can only be done through the teaching and the repetition, over and over again. And so, Zoom or Skype would be an excellent venue, so that we could have a Dharma talk like this, every night, on two continents! And that would be very beneficial for other students, other teachers. Hint, hint, DJ and Scott. Where's Scott? Scott's not here. Danny's not here. But yeah, we need a lot of that communication, community, where people can share the Dharma. That's where we learn it, by repeating it, by growing it. I mean, that's why people join clubs. A good example for me was the astrology club that I was invited to join. The astronomer The Astronomers Club, some of them with great big telescopes and easy access to the— what do they call that great big place? It's got stars and— a planetarium, that's what they call it. And those guys were really, really good buddies with each other. They didn't compete much, but they all were really curious about the new discoveries that Hubble was making. I bet those guys are all over each other right now over the stuff that the new telescope, the James Webb, is coming up with. Okay, so when we get really interested in something, we want to be in it a lot. We want to be around other people who are in it a lot. So that's what the Buddha came up with, with the the noble Sangha of monks, let's have a noble Sangha of friends, no matter how they're dressed or what they're doing. How many here, people, already have enough friends? Don't want any more? Had enough? Had it up to here with friends? Oh no, we can always use more friends. Had it up to here with us, huh?

**Speaker E:** I actually feel that I have a lot of friends, so yeah, yeah, you're right, never enough.

**Speaker A:** And not only that, but here on the international song, there's still not enough of us to find each other locally. But I bet that there would be good Dharma friends in whatever city that you're in. You just don't know who they are. So we need a way of connecting, so that you can have close, dear friends. And an opportunity to practice generosity. That's one last thing that I'll say, is that when I first became a monk, I didn't like it, because Ajahn Po took me on Pindapata himself, along with a few other monks, and took us to the back of the Wat, to a really, really poor neighborhood. It was hard to get there, it was slim pickings while we were there, and hard to get back to the Wat, intentionally so, part of the training. And that my attitude was, "Hey, why should I want to take anything from these people?" They're already poor enough, and I'm better than they are because I've seen better money than they ever have. You know, that kind of mentality. But then I learned to actually be grateful to their generosity. I was ruining their generosity by being above it. Their gifts weren't good enough for me, sort of like Johnny when he gets socks from Granny at Christmas. And he looks down on those socks, and looked down on Granny, and goes, "That's all you've got for me, socks for Christmas? Where's my pony?" And so, learning then to be grateful to these people. And as the gratitude grew, so was the bounty for some reason, it got better. Or maybe I just got used to it. But this is a part of the practice, is to learn to be generous and grateful with each other. That this is the thing that promotes friendship. And so, we go about looking for ways to help people. That's one of the reasons why I will keep to anybody who wants to come to Thailand, they've got a free room on my porch here. They're welcome, you're welcome. Susan, even you, you're welcome; we've got room for women. So, practicing generosity, in fact, is what this is all about. The Asian people generously provide for the monks, and the monks provide for the lay people, but they still have a lot of Dharma left over. And so having Westerners come in, they would love that. They really want you. Every time that I've sent someone to the Wat to go check it out, they always come back with, "Wow, those people, they wouldn't want to let me go home, they wanted me to stay." So, in the Western society, we don't expect that. Because this Western society is full of fear, trepidation, danger, kind of like the idea that everybody's out to rip us off. Every stranger that we meet is a dangerous person, and we can change that attitude within our group here to where every stranger you see is a perfect opportunity for a new friend. If you're open, we can build a Sangha. Anybody got any more questions? Like, why can't you talk about something else?

**Speaker C:** I've got to go, and I'm just going to say bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** Bye. Okay, bye-bye, Susan.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, first I have a— if someone comes to Spain, to the south, I have a place that we can stay. I mean, it's just, if you're just passing by here, I have like 2 rooms to spare. And are we doing, are we doing like a database of Wats or something? Because in Spain I know like Maybe 3, 4 places, uh, different, different traditions.

**Speaker A:** There's Tibetan. And so having those connections, having their website, having their email, having their phone number, having their address, having their information about their tradition, having some photos, all of that stuff would be good. That's what we want to put in the database so that when be look up a lot. We can find out all that information about them. Cool.

**Speaker E:** Okay, I will start working with that then.

**Speaker A:** And there's various different search techniques that we could use to help find each other. For instance, sometimes you want to look for just Watts, and sometimes you want to look for anything that's Theravada, and then sometimes you want to look for only people who are beginning students. Or you want to only reach for teachers. Okay, okay. So this is the kind of searching that we can do so that people can connect with the kind of people that they're looking for and build that. That's awesome. I hope that it becomes that way. Well, I'm not sure what awesome means, but, uh, Maybe the right word is aw shucksdom.

**Speaker E:** A what?

**Speaker A:** Aw shucks.

**Speaker E:** Oh, I don't know that one.

**Speaker A:** It's what you say when you're being complimented and you're shy or embarrassed. All right, all right, all right. Okay, aw shucks. Okay, but awesome, like I get into a state of awe all the time.

**Speaker C:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, let's hope that in fact the website can help a whole lot of people get into States of Awesome. So does anybody else have anything? Kat, you've actually put some info just going into the database. Well, my what, uh, report kind of thing on the website? Yeah, yeah, we've already— it's on, it's up. Yeah, so it's up. And, uh, uh, Jesus, you are Jesus, rather. You've already put, uh, uh, one or two things up. I've just seen them, uh, and if you've got to other places that you would like to get their information about and give a review Uh, get some photos, an icon, something like that. Anything that you got, we'll put it on our database. Okay.

**Speaker E:** Yes, I sent, I sent the Portuguese one, but I am gonna, in, in some weeks, I'm gonna be visiting some, some others.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. I would like that. David, you can write up the verses that you've seen on, uh, uh, Koh Samui.

**Speaker C:** Yes, I would like to do that. I've already wrote a bit about the last center I went to, so I'd like to post that still. Also, one thing, one question.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker C:** So the temples, the monasteries in the West, they usually have websites, right?

**Speaker A:** No. And if they do, it's in some foreign language. Usually, yeah, it's only if— here's the thing, if you've got a Lao Wat who has an English language website, that's only because they've had a farang who comes and has been at the Wat long enough to fall in love with the place and has done their website. And maybe that's really easy to do because they've already got it up in Thai anyway. And so going on to multi-language, but no, that's one of, that's one of the problems of gathering information is that it's in a foreign language, and yet we can do it anyway.

**Speaker C:** Here in Thailand, I, I find it's very hard to find information on the Watts here because usually they don't have websites like each month. Like, it's hard to find information, like a program or like anything.

**Speaker A:** Like, right, that's why I'm playing, doing the role of information central for all the Westerners who I know of coming to Thailand, because I know a lot of wats, but I don't know them all. Then in fact, on Koh Samui, I don't know them all. I barely know any much about all of them on this island. I've been to most of them, but on Koh Samui, forget it. There may be 75 or 100 wats on that island. The one that I would recommend for you to go next to is Wat Lamai. It's, by the way, in the town of Lamai.

**Speaker C:** Wat Silanu, is that the right temple?

**Speaker A:** The name of it, as far as I know, they all called it Wat Lamai, and it may have a more formal name. For instance, the wat Si Lanu is the what that everybody says, but it's got actually a Google name of Tamaratana. And so how are you going to get Si Lanu or Si Lanu out of Tamaratana? There's a difference, and that's going to be the problem. So when I tell you what— like, for instance, I was just overjoyed to find out that Wat Phra Ngoen Boa, which was the wat that was dying and dead by 1990, has now got a huge amount of construction. It's a full-blown wat now. But it was a derelict, it was a wreck. Every building was falling down with holes in the floor and all that kind of stuff in the late '80s. And now it's got all brick structures all over the place. And that's a big surprise. But the thing that's also a surprise is it's still got the same name in the same place, Wat Phang Boa, which— David, you got your video off. So anyway, those are the kind of places that we can put just a line or two on, but especially we want to find the places in Thailand that already received Westerners, and I have found now, much to my pleasure, that it's not nearly as tight as it was in the 1990s. In the 1990s, Thailand had kind of had it up to here with Westerners coming to ordain because they don't know how to fit into the society and they want their freedom, and basically that if a monk has to go someplace like to a dentist or maybe even shopping, he should take a friend with him. They don't travel alone. So when you see a monk out traveling alone in places that a monk shouldn't be, and it's a Westerner, the Thai people, they know that. And so there's a lot of stuff. And I can say also that Achan Chah's tradition has been able to train the Western monks correctly. That if a wat is associated with Ajahn Chah, pretty well you can believe that it's a good place to go, because the monks there are well trained. But at one time, that was the only wat in Thailand that anybody could go to, to ordain. But that's been loosened up a lot. I've got in fact two new places, because both Eric and Kema Sutu ordained outside of that tradition. So I know that there's other places. So that would be one thing that I would like to find out about Thailand is where can we send— if, for instance, it's possible that right now we've got 5 or 6 guys right here in Thailand. What's going to happen when you— when there's 150 to 200 guys? What happens when we've got a whole yard full of tents here? You know, there's other places for them to go. The only reason they'd have to stay here is because I'm too ignorant, too stupid to go find out places for people to go. So that's— I'm really interested, David, in finding that. So you help me and we'll go figure it out. I'll send you to a few places to see, uh, if you want. We can go look around to find out the places. I'd really like for somebody to go to Laos to visit some of the wats there. Why? Because I know that Dhamma Vittu, excuse me, that both Eric and Kamma Situ have already been in wats in Laos. And so, I've already known that the connection was very strong between the Lao monks and the Thai monks. Especially in the border areas. But now we can see that the Porong are actually crossing that border too. And I already also know that there's a place in Phnom Penh that if somebody wants to go to Kamma Arya, we've got one place that I can send them there. But that's a city wat. It's actually downtown Phnom Penh. But there's another wat that I know of in Bhante Bong, that would be good for a young monk for training, because it's actually a grammar school and high school for young boys. The monks have traditionally had an education system here in Thailand that's fallen apart, because the government's doing education now, big time. But over in Cambodia, the government still doesn't have an education educational system going, so most of the kids that are educated are educated in the wat. But they don't have to be orphans; mom and dad— in fact, what they do is, the boys go out on vendabat, following one monk that's the head, an adult monk, and he carries all these kids all through the neighborhood; but basically what he does is, he knows the route, and he takes kids that are on his route, so that every kid meets their family every day. So, Mom doesn't have to go to the wat to catch up on him; the kid's there every morning for breakfast. And Mom comes out and feeds her boy like she feeds all the other kids in line. I think that's quite beautiful, but that's how they do it in Bantambang, and I would suggest to anybody, that would be a good wat for a Westerner to go hang out. So, this is the point: In the future, things are going to get tough, because of the mentality in the West of "you've got to work, you've got to eat." And now all of a sudden, there's not going to be any jobs by 2050, 2040; there's not going to be enough jobs. What are people going to do? Well, we've got the way of the Buddha. To just sit and hang out. A little of everything will do you, and you can have a very happy life. But the Westerner is not going to figure that out on their own, now are they? So does anybody have any questions? You guys have been really silent today. Oh, I don't think I have any questions, but I just want to thank you. This is my first time joining, so I'm grateful. Oh, okay. Yeah, it would be good if you gave me a call and we can talk about basic practice. Okay, yeah, I will do that. Okay. Yeah. Marcus, do you have anything to add? You look like you're really laid out and comfortable. I mean, I'm just glad that the project is taking off and haven't been involved myself because I'm kind of busy.

**Speaker C:** With exams and stuff for a little.

**Speaker A:** Bit, but we'll see. All right, I'll take that as a definite later.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I was curious, Dhammarato, So like, currently, does one kind of need to go to Asia in order to like fully ordain, essentially? Like, you can kind of— that's the.

**Speaker A:** Mentality, but it's not the case. And in fact, in, uh, basically what we have to do is put things together, and this is what it takes. Number one, it takes an Upaya, it takes an Arahant, It takes a wat, it takes an individual Westerner, and a few people to support him. The Upajaya is the one who is actually responsible, and that the, um, the Arahant is who he's going to live with. And then the, um, The wat normally isn't going to be the wat where the achan is, and we can arrange that. Basically, any abbot of any wat, when you make friends with him and he likes the fact that you're around, he will take you under his wing, and if any talks about ordination or whatever happens, he will in fact know how to do that. Basically, what everybody wants and deserves is a really, really senior monk for good auspicious ordinations. That's a whole tradition that I don't want to get into in detail. But Kesa Thero was the Samadhi Sangha Raj of southern Thailand. It was like he was in the top 6 superstar monks in Thailand, and he was my Upaya. How did that happen? I don't know. Ajahn Poh did that, but it shows what kind of cloud Ajahn Poh had. All right. I do also know of a new Puja in the U.S. He hangs around. Let's see, where's this guy? He hangs around Atlanta and Dallas and that kind of area within the Lao community. And he's been— he's— the last time I saw him was 15 years ago. But he was a very young 40-year monk; he was just turning into his 60s. He's 75 now, but those extra years just give him more clout. So 40, 50, 55 years he's been a monk, and he's about 75. He does a lot of that duty. He's Upajayadana. A lot. Most of the ones who have that ordination are for those who are going to stay long term. If the kids are going to ordain for the weekend because Grandpa died, then they won't have such a high-class Upajaya that any monk will do. Actually, 20 years, a 20-year monk will do for that. But mostly you want a 40-year monk, a real Mahathera. So They're available in the West. That's the important point, is that are there any Upajayas in the United States or in wherever? Wherever they are, they're close enough that in fact, with the right kind of conversation, we can get him— because we did that on a regular basis from Atlanta to High Point— so that he could do an ordination or two. Because they love to travel.

**Speaker B:** Okay, cool. Yeah, no, I was just curious if you knew like any cases like in the States or what have you of people becoming like ordained.

**Speaker A:** So, oh yeah, yeah, I met guys. There was a guy in Tampa, another one who was in Orlando, uh, at, uh, Wat Greensboro. I was actually, um, not the not either the Upajaya nor the Achan, but I did take on the role of the teacher, or let us say like an instructor at the university rather than a professor kind of thing. But yeah, we ordained two of them, I think one in 2004, another one in 2006 or '07, something like that. So I've been around that kind of ordination. Yes, it's quite okay for Westerners to ordain in the West. If they can behave themselves, if they can, if they can be polite and happy, then that's all it takes. And that's a big deal for a lot of Westerners.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** Actually, the best one to talk to, I would say right now, is Eric, though he's hard to talk to because he's in Laos right now. But, uh, he's been in half a dozen Wats in the United States. He actually went on a Wat tour. He's been in the Wats in Orlando, and he'd been in the Wats in Mexico. He'd been in the Wats in, uh, all of them in Seattle area. And then in fact, that's what we will have, is, is that once some of you guys are staying in contact with us through the Open Sangha Foundation, that will help the network really grow. So that we can find these niches in places like that. Because if an abbot is willing to take one guy and train him, within a few months he's ready to take on another or two. We can start to pack the Watts. All we need is someone who cares enough about the Dharma that they want to leave the old world, but they're too afraid of ordination. Well, you don't have to ordain, just go live with those who are. And pretty soon you'll figure out whether that's the lifestyle that you want, and then you maybe eventually ordain. It's easy once you ordain, because then you'll get a whole lot of people to take care of you. We're the first organization just openly opening our mouth and says we're going to support lay people heading in that direction. Because that's the hard part. The guy's already jumped 100 or 1,000 hoops once he's in the robes. After he gets into robes, things are really easy. It's getting into those robes that's hard, and the reason is not because it's actually hard, it's because of ignorance and we don't know how to do it. But once we learn our way around, There may be a whole lot more Watts in the world. So if anybody's thinking about it, like hint, hint, Kat. Yeah, I was going to say this.

**Speaker C:** Is a really nice talk because I will be in Thailand exactly a month from today.

**Speaker A:** So David, you hear that? You got a new bro coming.

**Speaker C:** So yeah, I'm really appreciative. All right, I'll see you in a month.

**Speaker A:** I may see you, David.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Your mic is very noisy, David.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I'm on the ferry, sorry.

**Speaker A:** Oh, you're on the ferry. What, heading to where?

**Speaker C:** Uh, heading to Anapanasati.

**Speaker A:** Ah, well, I'll see you in a couple of days then. Coming home.

**Speaker C:** I'm going to Wat Khao Tam again.

**Speaker A:** Yes, let's do that together. I would like that.

**Speaker C:** You want to come too?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, not to stay, but just to see. I'm hoping that Dukkha is there. That's what I'm looking for, is to see if she's there. All right, does anybody have any parting words for this? All right, just thank you, just thank.

**Speaker E:** You for— thank you, thank you for, for all that, uh, what you said before about what the Anapanasati did for you, and now you're doing for us. Thank you for that, I really appreciate that.

**Speaker A:** My pleasure. I won't go so far as to say the pleasure is all mine because we know that's a bunch of crap. Okay guys, we'll see you. Bye.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, Dhammarato outlines the mission and vision of the **Open Sangha Foundation**. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Mission: Unify Buddhism in the West**
Dhammarato argues that Westerners often see Buddhist traditions (Theravada, Zen, Mahayana) as separate and divided, similar to Christian denominations. In reality, the core teachings of the Buddha are consistent across these schools. The mission is to bridge these perceived gaps and present a unified, accessible Dhamma.

### **The Problem: How Buddhism Came to the West**
Unlike in Asia, where monks traveled in groups to spread the Dhamma communally, Buddhism in the West has been transmitted primarily through books, the internet, and celebrities. This has led to fragmentation, misunderstandings, and a lack of direct, teacher-student relationships.

### **The Solution: A Three-Pronged Approach**
The Open Sangha Foundation aims to create a supportive ecosystem:

1.  **A Comprehensive Database & Network:** Create a detailed, searchable online platform (like a "LinkedIn for Buddhists") connecting:
    *   Students, teachers, and ordained monks.
    *   Various traditions and local wats/temples/centers.
    *   People geographically, enabling local Sangha building.

2.  **Financial and Logistical Support for Transition:** A primary goal is to support Westerners who wish to transition to a life dedicated to Dhamma, especially those afraid to leave the lay life due to financial insecurity. Support could include:
    *   Funds for travel, living expenses, and retreat costs.
    *   Encouraging people to visit and live at various Asian-led wats in the West to learn directly from monastics.

3.  **Revitalizing Local Wats:** The vision is to place dedicated Western practitioners in existing Asian-community wats across the U.S. and Europe. These individuals could:
    *   Learn from experienced Asian monks.
    *   Start English-language meditation classes and retreats at these locations.
    *   Be supported by the local Asian community, which is often very generous to monastics.

### **Key Philosophical Underpinnings**
*   **Breaking Cultural Baggage:** The goal is to help practitioners eventually drop cultural "baggage" (rituals, sectarian identities) and connect with the essence of the Dhamma.
*   **The "Swinging Door" of Ordination:** Unlike the permanent commitment in some religions, Buddhist monasticism can be fluid. It's acceptable to ordain, disrobe, and re-ordain as life circumstances require. This flexibility should be embraced.
*   **Paying it Forward:** The teaching is a gift. One cannot repay their teacher, but can "pay it forward" by generously sharing the Dhamma with others.
*   **Addressing Scandals:** Dhammarato links many scandals in Western Buddhist communities to a lack of proper monastic training and boundaries. Integrating with traditional monastic communities (Sangha) provides a proven ethical framework.
*   **A Response to Future Crises:** With AI and automation predicted to cause major societal disruption and unemployment, the Dhamma lifestyle—focused on contentment, community, and simplicity—is presented as a wise and sustainable alternative to fear and conflict.

### **Practical Steps & Community Building**
*   The database will help people find local Dharma friends and practice centers they never knew existed.
*   The foundation will promote generosity (*dana*) as a core practice, funding initial retreats with the hope that participants will then donate to support future ones.
*   Technology (Skype, Zoom) will be used for remote teaching, practice discussions, and building international connections.

### **Inclusivity and Women's Roles**
When asked about women's place in this vision, Dhammarato states they are integral. While logistical issues may exist at some smaller wats, the Asian lay women often run the temple communities and would help find solutions. The goal is inclusive retreats and practice.

**Overall Tone:** The talk is pragmatic, ambitious, and community-focused. Dhammarato presents the plan as a timely solution to heal divisions in Western Buddhism, make the profound benefits of monastic training accessible, and build resilient, generous, and fearless spiritual communities for the future.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on your transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate the mission and challenges of the Open Sangha Foundation. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **1. Metaphors**

**a) “Numbers fly, but days are all the same”**  
- Metaphor for how the mind confuses abstract measurements (calendar dates) with lived experience (each day as a “holiday” or holy day).  
- Represents the human tendency to get caught in conceptual thinking rather than experiencing life directly.

**b) “Putting traditions into buckets”**  
- Metaphor for how Westerners compartmentalize Buddhist traditions (Theravada, Zen, Mahayana) as separate rather than unified.

**c) “Saloon doors” on the monastery gates**  
- Represents the flexible, non-permanent nature of monastic life in Buddhism vs. the rigid “swinging door” of Catholic ordination.  
- Emphasizes that one can ordain, disrobe, and re-ordain freely in Buddhism.

**d) “Paying it forward”**  
- Metaphor for the chain of generosity: receiving teachings freely and then offering them freely to others, creating a cycle of giving.

**e) “Preemptive hugs instead of preemptive strikes”**  
- Metaphor for replacing fear-based aggression with proactive kindness and trust in community building.

**f) “Chimpanzees vs. bonobos”**  
- Chimpanzees represent aggression and conflict; bonobos represent conflict resolution through connection.  
- Metaphor for choosing a wise, harmonious human society over a fear-driven one.

**g) “Living the life of Riley”**  
- Idiom for a carefree, comfortable life—used humorously to contrast with the simple, content life of Dhamma practice.

**h) “LinkedIn for reality”**  
- Metaphor for the planned database—a professional-style network for connecting Buddhist practitioners, teachers, and monasteries.

---

### **2. Stories & Anecdotes**

**a) Story of the man who ordained seven times**  
- Told to illustrate the flexibility of Buddhist monasticism: he disrobed to help his family with farming, then re-ordained repeatedly.  
- Emphasizes that monastic life isn’t a lifelong prison but adaptable to life’s needs.

**b) Speaker’s own experience with his mother**  
- Anecdote about his Southern Baptist mother acknowledging that Buddhist monks live a “higher quality” life than Christian preachers.  
- Used to show that Buddhist ethics and contentment can be recognized even by those of other faiths.

**c) Story of going on alms round in a poor neighborhood**  
- Describes his initial reluctance to accept food from the poor, and how he learned gratitude and humility through their generosity.  
- Teaches the importance of receiving gracefully as part of spiritual practice.

**d) Reference to scandals in Buddhist communities**  
- Mentions scandals involving teachers (e.g., “Chuladasa”) as a cautionary tale—contrasts with the disciplined, scandal-free life of properly trained monks in Asian monasteries.

**e) The spread of Buddhism in Asia vs. the West**  
- Historical story: in Asia, monks traveled in groups and taught in person; in the West, Buddhism spread through books, internet, and celebrities, leading to fragmentation.

**f) Anecdote about Thai women training monks**  
- Explains how in Thai culture, women uphold monastic discipline by respectfully enforcing boundaries, which helps keep monks’ conduct pure.

**g) Vision of a future with AI and job loss**  
- Story-like projection: with AI replacing jobs, people could turn to Dhamma practice and community living—but many will instead react with fear and violence (“AK-47s and Glocks”).

---

### **3. Recurring Imagery**

- **Baggage**: Cultural baggage that can be dropped to access the core Dhamma.
- **Darkness vs. light**: Current ignorance about available monasteries vs. the “light” of an organized database.
- **Wealth without money**: Feeling rich through contentment and generosity, not material accumulation.
- **Planting seeds**: Supporting laypeople to ordain will grow the Sangha like planting seeds in Western monasteries.

---

These metaphors and stories serve to:
- Clarify the vision of a unified, accessible Western Sangha.
- Contrast Eastern and Western approaches to Buddhism.
- Illustrate key Dhamma principles (generosity, flexibility, fearlessness).
- Make the talk relatable and memorable through vivid imagery and personal experience.
