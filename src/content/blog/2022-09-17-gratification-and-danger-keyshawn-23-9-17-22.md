### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Oh, you turned your camera off. Uh, as bodyguard, we all know that one.

**Speaker B:** You broke up. For me there.

**Speaker A:** All right, so it's important to recognize that we gain great benefit from arguing with people. We get to feel big and tough and powerful. We begin— we like the feeling of being right, standing our ground. I've got rights, you know. And that in that stance, generally people are not actually listening to each other, they're more interested in putting out their views. So here you are having two people spewing their views at each other, without anyone there to listen. It often takes a third party to listen. To the two of them, to recognize that they're in the same choir. And so, we gain great benefit from arguing, and we will continue to argue until we begin to recognize that arguing has dangers. It's got ramifications, it's got issues, it's got problems, especially when people are not listening to each other. So that's one of the great disadvantages of being in an argumentative mood, is that you're not listening. Arguing is an offensive position, and when two people are in offense, they very rarely have a decent defense.

**Speaker B:** I guess you could say that wanting something has its benefits. And then when you see the downsides, when you see the danger of wanting something, you see that danger.

**Speaker A:** You've got choices, don't you? If you can only see the advantage, you've got no choice. But if you can see both the advantages and the gratification negations and the dangers, that in fact, while you were having that argument, you didn't recognize that now, whatever the now is and how many hours it was ago, you'd feel this way because of that argument. So if you could project ahead in the next argument, that after that argument is over, I'm going to crash land with this jet plane I'm flying all over the area.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So now you can see the, um, the danger. You have just crashed.

**Speaker B:** It was, it was like, uh, kind of like, um, you started with wanting something, and then so there was that, and then the danger was received, and then as you received the danger, it was like, oh, might as well argue about it. Right? You might as well argue about it, then you receive the danger of that too.

**Speaker A:** Well, here's actually, to continue that air dogfight metaphor, is that one of the reasons why in an argument we don't want to listen is because we don't want to get shot down in flames. And so it doesn't matter whatever anybody else says, no matter how true or useful it would be, We don't listen. Then we wind up finding out that we did get shot down after all, and we weren't paying attention when our tail was on fire. Yeah, you have been shot down.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And, and guess what? Almost all of us who get involved in these verbal dogfights Aerial acrobatics of the mind and all of that, we all come away wounded from such warfare and such encounters. Everybody gets wounded, unless we're lucky and then we get killed. Because who needs a self that gets wounded anyway?

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** That's the whole point of the argument, is trying to protect this me that's in there. And you and I have talked before about let women have their way. They'll be marvelous leaders if you give them a chance, but they make poor opponents in a bedroom ring. So let her win. Remember to let her win, but remember to let her win just at the time when you want to launch your rockets. And don't— or as we've said before, keep thy mouth shut.

**Speaker B:** Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** Let her rant as she pleases. She won't last long if you don't give her any new ammunition. And then, in fact, one of the things that can happen is that you can learn a new word in that, and that is that when she does wound you, you can start using the word ouch. She sees that she's got you and you say, ouch, she may not continue with her machine gun rat-a-tat-tat at you. She got you. That was painful. I surrender, you're the boss.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Because that's going to happen eventually anyway. Why not get it over with quickly. I mean, that's exactly what you're going to do after this call, isn't it? You're going to crawl back. So why did you crawl away wounded? You could have stayed there wounded.

**Speaker B:** That's hilarious.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so look at all this crawling unnecessarily that's been happening because you weren't mindful of letting her win.

**Speaker B:** That's true.

**Speaker A:** That's a good— when I was a child at church, and I'm sure that this happened in more than one church, so it gave me the idea that this was the actual teaching and I've heard it from grandmas, etc., like this, and so it may be a kind of a Southern tradition. But the point is, is that a married couple, especially a new married couple, should not go to bed angry. Have you ever heard such a thing?

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Q] Yeah.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] Yeah, guess what? It is an invitation to have warfare 'Tonight.' Rather than letting each other go to bed and cool off. In fact, I have seen that work so marvelously, that Tam gets her fur, and I just shut up and don't say anything, and then she comes home from the next day's work, and I'll say, 'Are you still angry?' And she'll say, 'Of course not.' She got over it because I didn't push her any of her buttons to make her sore anywhere. I didn't attack her. Yes, let her be. The silly one is, is that she misunderstood when I said that I've got 5 students who want to come to Thailand. She imagined 5 of them here at the same time. Which is unlikely to happen. Serendipity is not that intelligent.

**Speaker B:** Well, what serendipity is that you mentioned crawling? Because I'm currently laying on the ground right now.

**Speaker A:** I'm sorry, can you, uh, not growl that? Can you say it?

**Speaker B:** It was, uh, serendipitous that you, you mentioned, uh, crawling because I am in fact laying on the ground right now.

**Speaker A:** That's what the human mind does. We make those connections.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, so other than giving you my joy What can we do? Can I— what can I do to get a big smile on your face? What can I do to kick you in the pants and say, look how dusty those things are? Well, I'm already smiling now, so— you're already what now?

**Speaker B:** I'm already smiling now, so— oh, right.

**Speaker A:** Okay. All right. Is that smile big enough that you could keep it on all to crawl all the way back because you've got a long way.

**Speaker B:** Do I have to?

**Speaker A:** You want to, you need to. You don't need my advice about that. We know you're going to do it. The trouble is, or the question, brother, is, is how much trouble are you going to make it? Can you let us say waltz or dance into the room and do a Rick and Morty imitation? Or what was it that Robert Williams did? Okay, and be playful. And in that playfulness, apologize. Why was I a dick last night? I should have kept my mouth shut. And then duck.

**Speaker B:** I could give it a shot.

**Speaker A:** Well, you don't have to win, do you? And if you do win, what will that mean? What kind of prize are you going to get? If you tough it out, anger on.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Are you going to party on? That's your question. When are you going to get over it?

**Speaker B:** Don't be sorry, party.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** I said don't be sorry, party.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's a good one. Don't be sorry, party. That's the That's the teaching of the Buddha right there. Don't worry, be happy. Don't sorry party. That's as good as Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I was on my way to a festival actually, and I like bumped into someone that I said sorry, and they turned around and said, don't be sorry, party. That always stuck with me after that. I like that.

**Speaker A:** Well, the next time you bump into somebody and they turn around to see what happened, you can say party on.

**Speaker B:** All right, well.

**Speaker A:** I'm glad that you're out of your funk mode. You, when you called, recognize that you've got choices, but recognize them earlier while you're in that argument so that you recognize that you do have a choice of letting her win and shut your trap.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And if you do it now, it's easier than later.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yep. And don't, don't think that just because the two of you are having a spat that you've got to end that spat by spadding on. That, that whole thing that I was mentioning, make sure that you understand that, that Giving it a rest may be just the thing that's needed. Yeah, better sleep on it, shall we say.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I've done that successfully before too. I'm gonna do it again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it works. Yeah. So what is it, uh, uh, 1:18 there your time tonight? Yeah, yeah. So party on and then talk to her tomorrow.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker A:** I think in fact I understand why it's all black. It's because you've got no place to go.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I guess so.

**Speaker A:** All right, so you're halfway there. Now you have to do is you got nothing to do.

**Speaker B:** I'll try the Rick and Morty thing.

**Speaker A:** All right. No, it's not. It's Mork and Mindy. That was the TV. Yeah, Mork and Mindy is what I'm remembering with. So Robin Williams, he'll be playful with tomorrow. Leave her alone tonight. Well, I'm already here, so I know, but don't bother her. Yeah, stay wherever you are. Okay, turn your cell phone down, lay down, and go to sleep.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** And if she asks you tomorrow why did you do that, you say, because I didn't want to bother you. I felt so bad about how bad I was with you. So sorry.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, I've got an assignment for you, but we'll talk about that another time. Let's let this one happen. Okay, good night, sweet prince. You're the winner here by letting him in.

**Speaker B:** Well, glad I called.

**Speaker A:** I'm glad you did too. This has been hilarious. All right, see you soon.

**Speaker B:** All right, we'll talk soon. Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A), centers on the **dangers of arguing** and offers practical, often humorous, advice for resolving interpersonal conflict, especially within a relationship.

**Core Teaching: The Futility and Danger of Argument**
*   **The "Benefit" of Arguing:** We argue to feel powerful, right, and to defend our "self." However, in this offensive stance, **we stop listening**. An argument becomes two people "spewing views" with no one truly receiving them.
*   **The Inevitable Crash:** Dhammarato uses the metaphor of an aerial dogfight. By not listening to avoid being "shot down," we inevitably crash anyway—leaving everyone wounded. The "self" we were protecting ends up hurt.
*   **Seeing the Danger is Key:** We only have a choice to stop arguing when we see not just the temporary gratification but also the **downside and danger**—the emotional crash that follows.

**Practical Advice for Relationship Conflict:**
The discussion shifts to a specific scenario where Speaker B is in a conflict with his partner.
1.  **Let Her Win:** The primary strategy is to consciously **yield and "let her win,"** especially at the moment you most want to retaliate. This disarms the conflict.
2.  **Keep Thy Mouth Shut:** By not providing "new ammunition" (counter-arguments), the rant will naturally subside.
3.  **Use "Ouch" and Surrender:** If a comment wounds you, simply say "ouch" and surrender. "You're the boss." This acknowledges the pain and ends the battle quickly.
4.  **Sleep On It:** Dhammarato challenges the common advice to "not go to bed angry." Instead, **give it a rest**. Allowing time to cool off overnight often resolves the anger naturally.
5.  **Return Playfully:** Don't crawl back wounded. Return with a playful, humorous attitude (he suggests a Robin Williams/Mork-style imitation), apologize simply ("Why was I a dick last night?"), and be light-hearted.

**Underlying Dhamma Principles:**
*   **Non-Harming & Letting Go:** The advice prioritizes ending the cycle of verbal harm (right speech) over "winning" or being right.
*   **Mindfulness of Choice:** The key is to recognize the choice point *during* the argument—seeing that you can choose to stop defending the self.
*   **Release of Dukkha:** The entire process is aimed at ending suffering (*dukkha*)—the suffering caused by conflict, wounded pride, and estrangement.

**Conclusion:** The talk summarizes with the playful phrase **"Don't be sorry, party,"** encapsulating the idea of letting go of regret and choosing happiness over being right. The assignment for Speaker B is to apply this wisdom: give space tonight, and reconnect tomorrow with playfulness and apology, thereby being the "winner" by letting his partner win.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate the dynamics of arguments and relationships:

### **Metaphors:**

1.  **Warfare / Combat Metaphors:**
    *   **Dogfight / Aerial Combat:** The argument is compared to a jet dogfight. People don't listen because they "don't want to get shot down in flames." They engage in "verbal dogfights" and "aerial acrobatics of the mind," and everyone comes away "wounded" from the "warfare."
    *   **Crash Landing:** Arguing is likened to flying a jet that will inevitably "crash land" afterward, leaving you in a bad state.
    *   **Weaponry:** The arguer is told not to "launch your rockets." The partner's words are compared to a "machine gun rat-a-tat-tat," and the advice is not to give her "any new ammunition."

2.  **Physical Struggle / Defeat Metaphors:**
    *   **Crawling:** The person who argues and loses is described as having to "crawl back" or "crawl away wounded."
    *   **Surrender:** The strategy is to surrender early: "I surrender, you're the boss."
    *   **Bedroom Ring:** Arguments in a relationship are compared to being "poor opponents in a bedroom ring" (a boxing ring), suggesting a domestic fight.

3.  **Performance / Play Metaphors:**
    *   **Dance / Waltz:** Reconciling is suggested as something you can "waltz or dance into."
    *   **Playfulness / Imitation:** The advice is to be "playful" and do a "Rick and Morty" or "Mork and Mindy" (Robin Williams) imitation when apologizing, turning a tense moment into a performance.

### **Stories / Anecdotes:**

1.  **The "Don't Go to Bed Angry" Tradition:** The speaker recounts a common piece of marital advice from his childhood (a "Southern tradition" heard in church and from grandmas) that couples should never go to bed angry. He then **subverts this story**, arguing it's actually an "invitation to have warfare 'Tonight'" and that it's better to sleep on it and cool off, sharing a personal example with "Tam."

2.  **The "Don't Be Sorry, Party" Festival Story:** Speaker B shares a brief anecdote about bumping into someone at a festival. When he said "sorry," the person replied, **"don't be sorry, party."** This becomes a reframed motto for the conversation, equated with "don't worry, be happy."

3.  **The Personal Example with "Tam":** The speaker (A) gives a concrete story from his own relationship. When his partner was angry ("gets her fur up"), he chose to "just shut up." The next day, he asked if she was still angry, and she wasn't, because he didn't "push her buttons." This story serves as a successful model for the behavior he's advising.

**Overall Purpose:** These metaphors and stories work together to paint arguments as a **losing, destructive battle** that wounds everyone involved. The alternative strategy is framed as **strategic surrender, playful disengagement, and giving space**—all to avoid the inevitable "crash landing" and "crawling" defeat that follows a prolonged fight. The anecdotes provide both a counterexample to common wisdom and a positive model to follow.
