### Transcript


**Speaker A:** that the practice, when we get into the flow, now we have to know two questions, and that is in the sense of how do we keep it going and what do we do with it when we have it.

**Speaker B:** So a little update on my practice. So yesterday, last night, the day before, I sat for one hour straight each night And it was absolutely wonderful each time. I was sharp the entire hour and I never lost track of the breath even once. I was happy the whole time. You know, it was absolutely great. Two nights ago, it was like 3 in the morning, 4 in the morning, and I hadn't gone to bed yet, but I had so much energy afterwards that I had no desire at all to go to bed, even though it was like 4 in the morning. And then yesterday I did it, and I did go to bed after, but I still felt great, you know. And it was just great. It's really nice. I just thought I'd report that before

**Speaker A:** we talk about— okay, one comment on that is that yes, Anapanasati done correctly is energizing. That in fact, feeling on top of your game is exactly evidence that you are practicing correctly.

**Speaker B:** Right. Right.

**Speaker A:** And that's one of the reasons why the Buddha gives people full permission, almost in the sense of a direction, is that we teach wakefulness. I think in fact we had talked about that at one time when you were working, then you were tired and you were not getting enough sleep. And I would say, you got to get enough sleep. And then I think that I even said to you at that point in time is there will come a time when we change it from getting enough sleep into what do we do with our time when we've gotten enough sleep, which is exactly what we're talking about, of pointing out to that In fact, this is part of the training on the Pātimokkha. We had already started talking a bit about the Pātimokkha before and all of that. Once a month, in many places, and in some places they do it twice a month, I kind of believe that we did it once a month in the feeling of once in one month, as well as the fact that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's hair got really long before he cut it. And that they only cut it before Patti Mawk as part of the ritual. So in any case, we also spend the night up, and that the common occurrence would be that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa would start teaching at about 2 o'clock in the morning. And so everybody was already up and sitting around waiting for his talk, and he would talk then from 2 in the morning until sunrise.

**Speaker B:** Wow.

**Speaker A:** And then sunrise was when the monks would then get up, and some of them were getting up kind of early out of the thing to go out on Bindaba. So that was the reason for ending it when it did. But that now is the morning of the day of Paddy Mokk. It's the night before Paddy Mokk. The monks are up all night. In fact, even in the old Jewish calendar, the new day started at sundown, not sometime deep in the night or waking up in the morning.

**Speaker B:** The lunar calendar.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the lunar calendar starts at night. So Paddy Monk starts the night before Paddy Monk, and the monks are up all night intentionally.

**Speaker B:** So yeah, yeah, okay. So that's to me Yeah, how about the commonalities, you know, between the ancient religions? There's a lot of more commonality there. But anyway, please continue. Yeah, the lunar calendar is just a great example of that, right?

**Speaker A:** Well, that's all they had. Yeah, in fact, I like that very much. I enjoy mooning people.

**Speaker B:** Oh boy.

**Speaker A:** So anyway, back to what we were talking about. Yes, that the practice, when we get into the flow, now we have to know two questions, and that is in the sense of how do we keep it going and what do we do with it when we have it.

**Speaker B:** This actually, yes, and I had a question related to this.

**Speaker A:** All right. Well, do you want to go into that direction or into Right Livelihood? Both of them were worth an hour.

**Speaker B:** Let's do the practice first. And, you know, I have plenty of time to worry about Right Livelihood for another time. Or we could do that later today. I don't know. We'll just see how it goes. But let's stick to the practice for now. And then we can do Right Livelihood when it's best.

**Speaker A:** All right. So in the correct practice, the entire intention of one's early practice, the very first thing that's to be done is the removal of the hindrances, which can also be stated as removal of unwholesome thoughts and putting wholesome thoughts in the mind. This is the first step. And to do that step means that we have to do a bit of an investigation. In fact, to be able to do that, we're already noting. But if we talk about noting from the perspective of noting, then it changes a frame of reference. But because here is very much like we're noting, but we're also on a fox hunt. In, in the sense we know what we're looking for. With the noting, it's like whatever comes up, note it, right? Here we're going to say, um, uh, go out there and whatever it is that comes up, if it is game, kill it. Okay, this is a hunting expedition. Pardon?

**Speaker B:** Versus— it's a fox hunt versus whack-a-mole, right?

**Speaker A:** This is a game of whack-a-mole. The Buddha actually talks about it in, in the case of, uh, the deer— excuse me, the, the cowherd that I— the story that I've told you, right? And so this is the whole point about that. We've really got to have a skin in the game so that we're actually in a way creating the reality that we're in right now in a way that we've never been able to create reality before. Now, the next point about that: this reality that we're beginning to learn to create is actually much closer to the actual real reality than the way that humans normally operate. Because the reality is that everything that can happen does happen right now, and anything that did happen has already happened and doesn't happen again. That Herodotus was right when he says you cannot step your foot in the same river twice. And yet our whole culture is built upon building upon the past. Let's get a foundation here, folks, and then we can build a higher and higher and bigger building. Yeah, instead of being just comfortable and happy sitting in a hut, right?

**Speaker B:** I think this is a big flaw of psychoanalysis too, is focusing too much on the past.

**Speaker A:** Yes, some of us call it psychological archaeology, right?

**Speaker B:** I had a dream like that one time, like it was very literal. I was, uh, driving in— well, this sounds like psychoanalysis now, talking about it. But I was, I was driving.

**Speaker A:** I have actually read On Interpretation of Dreams. That's the name of the book.

**Speaker B:** Me too, by Freud. Yeah, it's a classic.

**Speaker A:** You got to be half Jewish to read that book, so I've got something in there. The Mormons thought it too because I've got some Indian blood.

**Speaker B:** There you go. It's a good book. You know, we read— I took a class, I took two classes where we read Freud. He wrote another great one called Moses and Monotheism that I highly recommend. I think you would really like that. It's a short little book. It's like 200 pages. And anyway, but I had this dream one time where I was driving on the West Side Highway on the outside New York, outside Manhattan. And I never drive here. It's one of the one thing— one of the one thing I really like about living here. I don't have to drive anywhere. That's like the best thing about this place. But, uh, or one of the best things, you know.

**Speaker A:** You live on an island, there's no place to drive to.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, it's great. I live on an island too, you know. But anyway, so I was driving on this highway.

**Speaker A:** Mine looks like one though.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that's true. But I saw this big section off the highway that had these archaeological ruins, and I was really interested in that, and I wanted to go see it. And so I drove off and parked my car to get out and go look at it. In the ruins, and then I woke up. I had that dream several months ago. It was kind of an interesting dream. But anyway, I don't know why I felt like sharing that, but you mentioned psychological archaeology. I just thought I'd share that with you. But it was a very interesting dream for me.

**Speaker A:** The remembrance of the dreams and the remembrance of the past is all stored. It's actually all made up in the same place, the hippocampus, and it's all stored in the same area, something like the cerebellum or things like that. And because it's in the past, you could imagine what the Buddha would have to say about it. Forget about it. A lot of people like to do interpretation of the dream and sense that the dream means something. But within the context of Anapanasati, what it means is, is that it means that you're dreaming. So what? You're dreaming. Uh, the, uh, the, the phrase is burning by day and smoldering by night. All we do is put a blanket on it, but other than that, the mind is still on fire. And this is why it's so important for Anapanasati. If people are going to sleep, is to practice a few minutes before they go to sleep to empty their mind so that they won't have so much dreaming, and then they'll get the rest that they actually need. As that begins to build up, pretty soon you go to bed at the same time that you're ready to go to bed, especially if you've already been practicing Anapanasati. And you're nowhere near ready to go to sleep yet. You're still wide awake. Well, this is exactly the way that the Buddha would expect the practice to go, that you're actually practicing being awake. And now here you are. I mean, it's like this is 2 plus 2, folks, here. Yeah, if we're practicing being awake and practicing energizing the mind and practicing energizing the body, then when that happens that means that we're not quite ready for sleep yet. So that means that now you can begin to play with your day as if it were a toy rather than a routine. And you can start to catnap if you want to. That this is much more of a natural way of living that you see in the West for the past— oh gosh, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 generations, especially since we've had electrical lighting. But even in the old days, when the slavers slaved the slaves, they did it all day, and the slaves had all night off for rest. But that's not normal. In the old, old days of hunter and gathering, the afternoon was hot and everybody kind of took a nap. They even have words for it in certain languages, like in Mexico, or like in Spanish, they have siesta. Yeah, okay, but that has something to do with the weather. But it certainly does point that there's no reason to think that we have to get 8 hours of sleep from 10 PM to 6 AM, right?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** But that's exactly what it's like in the military. I gave the military's hours: lights out 10 PM, reveille 6 AM, period. But that did not come because the, um, uh, the Army and the Navy and whatnot invented that, but rather that was already part of the culture, that humans had changed from living natural lives with our natural sleep patterns. And one of the things about becoming a monk and living in Thailand is you can allow yourself to go back to natural sleep patterns. Isn't that amazing? Even the freedom to go back and be natural, the way that humans were thousands and thousands of years ago, where the position of the Earth rotating around the Sun did not determine my day, that I was not tied to a clock or any concept of a clock. Other than a few things that fit in with things. For instance, about sunrise that we had talked about is a good time for the monks to go out because in the Thai society, the people already know that when they get up in the morning, that the way to get rid of all of their garbage from supper last night is to give it to the monks when they're passing by. And the funny thing, though, is, is that in Cambodia they do it at a later time of the day, because the monks go out then at 11 so that they eat by noon. But it's different cultures. But the whole point is, is that when the culture decides when the monks come out, that's when the monks come out. And, but that's the only schedule that they've got all day. The whole rest of the day is that— in fact, when I was a monk in the United States and the Christians and whomever would come and, uh, give interviews and questions, they would always say, well, tell me about your schedule? And I'd always slide and rub my chin and says, we do lunch, because that's about the only schedule that, that's there. And most— and many monks spend up not burning late night oil but are up at night. It is very, very quiet. It's cool if you're in the tropics. The nights are cool. And so it's good to be up at night and asleep when it's hot.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I like being up at night or really early because it's very— oh,

**Speaker A:** being up before the sun is really marvelous. That's a really nice time of day. Everything is still and quiet and the dust is settled out of the air because there's no foot traffic or whatever. And it's really— it feels clean. That's like Cleanest part of the day.

**Speaker B:** It is, it is. I used to live near Central Park and I'd go there at like 4 in the morning and the sun's just coming up, or 4:35, just starting to come up, and it was so beautiful. You know, no one's there, you're all alone, you just see the sun coming up and the sky is like this really dark blue, just starting to lighten up just a little bit. It was beautiful. I I love that.

**Speaker A:** Now, when the ordinary mind has already been established in a schedule of sleeping at night, then they're not quite alert to that. But if you are wide awake when that time of day happens, it's marvelous. Yeah, because we're awake to that marvel instead of being semi-conscious, you know. I don't care about how marvelous the world is. I've got to get my clothes on and get a shower and get out of here because I got to get to work. And that's exactly the way people think. Never mind how marvelous the world is right now. I've got work to do.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I used to be on a rowing team at the first university I went to, and we'd get up at 4 AM for practice at 5 on the lake every morning. And it was just really beautiful just being out there on the lake. 5:00, it's just starting to get sunny and you can hear the birds and the water is glassy. They'd like it at that time because that would be the time where there'd be the least amount of wind. So other times a day, if you'd go out, it'd be a little windy and you couldn't row as nicely.

**Speaker A:** It is the best time of day to get your mind together, and it's the best time of day to have your mind together. Yeah, and that's what we're practicing, is we're just practicing, let's get our stuff together, let's get our joy and get rid of these unwholesome thoughts and get our mojo going, get some energy here, let's get up for the game. Basically, it's— and this is so different than the attitude of meditation. The attitude of meditation is sitting still and being quiet and the mind has gone to who knows where. But it's supposed to be good way over there. And then people come out of that kind of state and they say, well, what value is this? This is a bunch of work, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I have a question about this that I've been waiting to ask for a little while now, which is, um, you know, so I find myself alternating between Piti and Sukkha, and I don't really know what's better, you know. And, and I, and I'd love to hear your thoughts on whichever you want

**Speaker A:** that you don't have. When you want it, that's Dukkha. When you experience it and are satisfied with it, whichever is coming, that's the correct practice. Here it is, there it goes. Here it is again, there it goes. Oh, you're here again, huh? I see you too. There you go. You're back. Ah, there you are. There you go. You hear what I'm talking about? I'm talking about the arising, passing away of phenomena, which is exactly what we wanted to get into in the sense of the original question was, now that you can get yourself into those states, what are you going to do with your time? The answer is you're going to watch these very wholesome states arise and pass away. That's exactly how the Anapanasati Sutta is set up, but for some reason it's hard to glean it out of there. But other suttas like Sutta 111 really point out this whole phenomenon of watching the arising and the passing away of every moment being different, really get into the fact that you are in a flow. And things are constantly fluttering and flowing and fluffing and flittering away and re-arising, and it is a marvelous show.

**Speaker B:** That's Sutta 111.

**Speaker A:** Sutta 111, one by one as they occur. What is that one by one as they occur? It's the phenomenon, and one by one means as they come up, the last one dies away. One by one as they occur.

**Speaker B:** It's called the Anapanasati Sutta. I just, uh, I just searched for it. Okay, great. I'll read this one later. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Well, let's put it this way, it's unlikely somebody intentionally wrongly named it. If it's MN 111, it's one by one.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I, I don't know, you know, like, you know, in the Bible it's like Mark 2:12 and then it's Luke 2:12, and you know, I don't know the naming system. For Buddhism.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, both in Buddhism and in the Bible, there's one thing that everybody knows, and that is how to find a passage based upon a name of a book and a verse. Okay, that's true in both Buddhism and in Christianity. And they also have something else deeply in common. And that is, once you have found the correct verse, doesn't mean a thing because you still don't know squat. But at least you found the right verse. You just don't know it yet. Okay, so that's the real issue, is not that we can find it. The answer is, do we understand it when we read it?

**Speaker B:** How'd you like the Bible verse I sent you the other day? Lunch, 11:35.

**Speaker A:** Oh yes, I've actually— that's in fact the— but that's not a Christian book, that's a Buddhist book. March is a Buddhist book, not Christian. That's what confused me.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And in fact, that's exactly lunchtime, 11:35.

**Speaker B:** Sure, great.

**Speaker A:** Which is about the time that the monks stop chanting and start chopping.

**Speaker B:** Sure. So, so you shouldn't— so when it— so, okay, so a couple more questions about this Piti-Sukkha thing. So, okay, so one thing I've noticed is I had an interesting thing happen yesterday, um, where, um, the Piti would come up and then I would notice the Piti and I would I decided to start really noticing the Piti, like really just going into it and just really studying that Piti. And it would expand and it would seem like it was less rough around the edges and more stable. And it would kind of stabilize and then kind of turn into something like Sukkha, but maybe a little different than my normal experience of Sukkha.

**Speaker A:** So, and so the whole show then is to keep watching that stuff as it goes into flow from one thing to the next. Uh, uh, there's always a constant show and flow going on, and as we stay in our sensory awareness of watching all of that— and, and this is actually sensory awareness in the sense of even noticing our feelings Noticing how we feel, noticing the states of mind and the various things that are changing within the mind then now becomes the new show in town. And there's something just very unique about this also that needs to be pointed out, and that is all this stuff that we're going to watch, and we'll actually go through them as both groups and individually in a moment. But the thing that they have in common is that all of these things are wholesome because we have already spent the time that it takes to remove unwholesome thoughts from the mind. Therefore, there are no unwholesome thoughts to bother with. In that regard, that means that we're only going to need to study the part of the mind that is wholesome. And also, there's no reason to try to study the part of the mind that's unwholesome, because that part of the mind is not working there right now. But we can walk right up to the door and kind of open the door and say, well, I don't want to go in there, and then close the door again. That's the kind of way that we're looking at it, um, in the sense of not allowing wholesome thoughts to come back in. So as long as we can allow the unwholesome thoughts to stay out, that means that we never get far enough into the sequence of Paticcasamuppada to get into the state of wanting something or into the state of trying to get rid of anything. And at that level, that means that we're kind of satisfied with what's happening right now. This is what we mean by wisdom at the point of contact. But the wisdom at the point of contact means that whatever we're now going to experience is going to be experienced wholesomely. And if we experience it ignorantly or delusionally and we're not spot on to what's really going on, then we would likely through that ignorance fall into a dissatisfying situation. Now intellectually, anybody would recognize that if you had a choice between being in a dissatisfying situation and a satisfying situation, we would naturally choose the satisfying situation. And yet very many people find themselves in dissatisfying situations, but they don't even recognize they've got a choice to get out of it, right? And what you're developing is you're developing the skill to wake up in time to recognize you've got a choice to get out of that stuff. And if you're doing it while you're— uh-huh. And if you're doing it while you're practicing, that means that you can sustain these wholesome thoughts one after another after another, which means now you've only got some things to note or to investigate. And that's what we're going to do now, is we're going to start investigating, because this investigation is now a new part of the skill development. Heretofore we have been developing the skill of investigation, and now we're going to further develop that skill of investigation by investigating the investigation system itself. How is my investigation? What does it look like? How do I know I'm seeing clearly? All right, then we can investigate other things like, how is my effort? Is this the best effort in the sense— and we can say technically the correct definition of right effort is just enough effort that it takes to come out of unwholesome thoughts. No more effort is needed, just that much— change the mind. And so even if somebody's putting in a whole lot of effort, but that a whole lot of effort is not changing the mind from unwholesome thoughts to wholesome. And an example of that is, oh, look how hard I'm trying, I know I can get something out of meditation, oh, I just need to keep doing it and keep working at it. Okay. Still always wanting something and never coming to the point of, you know, right now is good enough, why should I want anything? Which means now that's the effort that it takes to come out of the unwholesome thought into the wholesome. And somebody there is spending all of that effort and still remaining in unwholesome thoughts. So one's right noble effort is also a small amount of effort to just move that thought and If we have a bunch of negative thoughts in a row, that means they get on a roll, which means it's hard to break the pattern. But if you just have one immediate thought and then that thought is followed by a wake-up call— hey, look at that thought, look at what you're doing, that's Dukkha, yeah, that's Dukkha, hey Mara, I see you, out of here— and then you throw it out immediately, and then it's really easy to throw And so basically what we're talking about is keeping the mind wholesome while we're inspecting only in wholesome things, knowing that if something unwholesome comes up, it's out of here before it gets in line to be inspected.

**Speaker B:** Right. I was gonna ask, and I think you might have already answered my question, but just to double-check, um, so I found like my favorite kind of wholesome thought, the one that most gladdens the mind, is noticing the unwholesome.

**Speaker A:** And it's sometimes— Aha, I caught you, is very wholesome. I see that. There you go again. I caught you.

**Speaker B:** Yes. And sometimes it's so quick that I don't even have the time to, you know, like say aha, right? Like it's just like, oh, there it is. You know, it's this tiny little thing. I can't even tell you what the Buddhist teaching said.

**Speaker A:** It's already finished. That's the now. Now, so what we were seeing there was the arising. Now we want to also start to watch the passing away and the fading away. Watch the frittering away. And every time this arises, this had to pass away in order for this to arise. And when something new arises, then this flitters away. And so start paying attention to the flittering away, and you begin to see that, wait a minute, my whole life is in the past. I never do catch up to the present moment because everything has already happened by the time I know it, right? Yeah, you begin to see that. Who the heck am I? I'm always living in the past. I never caught up to the present moment.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. I once read that the way the Greeks, the ancient Greeks conceptualized time was it's like you're walking backwards. You only ever see behind you, you know, you can never see forward.

**Speaker A:** Can't see forward. We can't see it. And this is, this is why the Buddha puts that whole point. And it's in— this is like step 13, 14, 15, and 16 of Anapanasati. But it's also the key ingredient in this other sutta, number 111. That we put up. And that is to note these wholesome things in the sense that even the wholesome arises and passes away, arises and passes away, arises and passes away. So this means that now we're going to be finished with all that unwholesome stuff. Let it completely pass away. And now we're going to start looking at the fact that the first thing, in fact, on the list of items is that the mind is capable of applying itself to wholesome and then sustaining it on the wholesome. So you begin to monitor the wholesome thought, wholesome thought, wholesome thought, wholesome thought, wholesome thought, wholesome thought, like that. This is wholesome thought. And then we begin to see that the mind is in fact beginning to make connections in a new kind of way, because before the mind's been all over the place. But now we're beginning to get the mind steadied into one wholesome thought after another after another. And it's amazing, the change in mind. And so we begin to watch that change.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, these past two days, um, it was just so nice the whole hour that I didn't even like count down the time. I'll often when I'm sitting, think, okay, 20 minutes left, 10 minutes left, 5 minutes, you know, I'll do a little and I'll be a little bit happy because I've been like just getting a task done basically.

**Speaker A:** I did 35 minutes, I can do another 40. Yeah, I know that, right?

**Speaker B:** And right, and this time though, these past few days sitting for a full hour, um, and I've had this before with Anapanasati but not for a whole hour practice because it's my first time really diving in for an hour. Um, and I just like, I was like, I could keep doing this, you know. I have no problem. This is nice, you know. It's only 20 minutes. That's great. It could be another hour, you know. So it was just nice.

**Speaker A:** Now you're also ready. So here's something also new to do, but I do want to get back with you about the noticing of wholesome things. Noting what is perception and all of that. But there's also the issue of what are you going to do when you finish your meditation session? Are you going to say, I've had enough joy now that I can stand? Or are you going to start practicing getting up out of your meditation posture, whatever that is, and maintaining that position in the mind so that you can keep it going? Sustain it. Even though you walk up to the dog and put the leash on the dog and you walk out the door, you do it completely full of joy and completely mindfully. In fact, the dog may enjoy that walk better than you dragging him around. He drags you around now because you don't care where he goes. Yeah, yeah, because you're enjoying every bit of it. Right, you're enjoying the show. You're— so get yourself into a really good state and then start living your life that way.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, at Wat Chom Thong near Chiang Mai, they taught me to end my meditation with Metta, with making merit is how they called it, you know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and I'm telling you to do that exactly with your dog. I'm just giving you an exact example of it. Let the dog go where he wants to do. Give him the Metta now.

**Speaker B:** Sounds good.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so how you end it is that you don't end it. You just get up and go about doing something now in that wonderful state. Of mind. And that is your Metta, is to keep it going, keep it flowing. Practice that. In fact, start watching when it drains off, because it will. The world will keep whacking you, and I mean the dog will do something and you'll come right out of it,

**Speaker B:** right? Yep.

**Speaker A:** Unless you're really, really on top of your game, saying every thought you got to watch it. Am I really sustaining this thought? Am I really paying attention?

**Speaker B:** And so we— yeah, yeah, yeah. That a few weeks ago, I had a great day, and then I go to bed and I wake up and the dog had diarrhea and he pooped all over the carpet and it was a whole disaster. And then I was like, wow, this

**Speaker A:** is— he pooped more in your mind than he did on the carpet.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And it wasn't him, it was you that did that pooping.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I guess. But, uh,

**Speaker A:** so anyway, you can clean it up happily and be interested in his health and well-being, or you can kick the dog because you hate the fact that you got to clean his mess up. I mean, it's just a matter of attitude.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. I mean, I, you know, I was unhappy. I didn't kick him or anything because I don't believe in that, but I

**Speaker A:** Before you answer that, I want to have an interview with the dog.

**Speaker B:** All right, he's right here.

**Speaker A:** No, I'm just teasing. I'm teasing.

**Speaker B:** All right, all right.

**Speaker A:** So this is the whole concept then of what do we do with very, very wholesome states, because we're intending to spend a lot of time in the future in those wholesome states. What do we do with it? The answer is we're going to watch, we're going to investigate, we're going to be on top of the game, we're going to start inspecting how the mind actually works. We're going to start looking at what are feelings. Now that I can control the feelings, start looking at the fact that at one time before you couldn't, they controlled you. Now you're actually able to control the feelings. So can you control them in the way now of making them very subtle? Can you bring them up to the level of exuberance and bring them down to the level of no more exuberance but a sense of deep well-being and satisfaction, even further down into peace, down to the level of everything's all right, everything's fine, no worries? Everything's gone. And that's the level of Upekkha. Now, Upekkha can also be thought of as aloof, or away from it, or out of it. But we're not talking about aloofness in the sense of ignoring, or out of it in the sense of not ignoring. No, this kind of Upekkha is when we're really on top of the game, when we're really satisfied with the blanket we've laid out on our own mound of dirt. Okay, because we're now on top of the world and we should have— oh, you're— we got it. Okay, this is that confidence, and we start to build that confidence. So that's part of what needs to be looked at. How's my confidence? How is my strength of mind? Begin to look for ways of testing it to see How am I doing here? Bhikkhu Buddhadasa even refers to it in the sense of sickness. Yeah, that's a great opportunity to practice. That's a great opportunity to get right on top of the game, right? Hey, not only is this disease killing me, but I can die happily,

**Speaker B:** because

**Speaker A:** what are my choices? To die unhappily? And so this is the new way of looking at it, is that we got to get on top of the game regardless of how the show goes. What happens in the next act is not interesting. What's interesting is how you're handling what's happening right now, because if I'm really good at handling what's happening right now, I'll be ready for Act 4. In a three-act play. So this is what we do with that state. The number one thing, we get into it. Second thing is we learn to sustain it, we keep it going. But then later we begin to also recognize that we can maintain, like I was talking about, these feelings, to really get in touch with the feelings. And so we can bring them down quietly when we want to and then raise them back up to the level level of exuberance when we want to because we've got full control over our repertoire. And part of the songs that we don't play is, I guess the humorous way to say it, is ragtime. That we don't go funky, we don't go into the unwholesome, we play sweet music.

**Speaker B:** Well, it's funny because your point about choosing to elevate or not, that I feel like that's That's kind of what was going on with my alternation between the Piti and the Sukkha yesterday, is I was kind of going to the exuberance of the Piti and then back down to the coolness of the Sukkha, and then I'd be like, "Okay, I'm kind of bored of this right now. I'm a little bored, so I'm going to throw in some Piti again." And it's like, "Okay, enough Piti, back to the Sukkha. Let's chill."

**Speaker A:** Now you're getting it. Okay, so really what's going on is not only you are watching the arising and the passing away, by doing so, you're beginning to take control and manage your life. Congratulations! This is what it's all about. Who's the boss here anyway? Who— I mean, who's the lion? You heard that game, you know, like who's a good puppy? Well, who's the lion here? Who's the lion, you know?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, getting there.

**Speaker A:** Yes, this is what we're getting at, is that confidence is based upon success.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And that success is manufactured intentionally.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And it's done with a mind that's clear and pure and free from unwholesome thoughts. Because if we allow unwholesome thoughts in there, then we're basically poisoning our own brew. That's what people do. They live lives of poisoned self- poisoning their own lives by always telling themselves it could be better, or it could be better here or better there. In fact, everything's beautiful right now, right?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** So getting into that state of everything is beautiful right now and maintaining it now begins to be the goal, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's funny, I saw some family the other night. My cousin's getting married on Sunday, and he's my best friend as well. He's a very wholesome guy. And so his brother and his father were in town, and they were also at the dinner. His soon-to-be father-in-law and soon-to-be brother-in-law. And so there's a little bachelor you know, groom night or whatever the other night. And, um, you know, I noticed I was really just at ease, you know, the whole— I was just having a great time, you know. I was really— and the father of my cousin, who is my cousin, is my second cousin, so his father is really, uh, my father's cousin. So that's first cousin once— it doesn't matter, but I call him uncle, you know, that's all that matters. Called my uncle, you know, and he's this kind of guy that likes to do these little digs, you know, and likes to do these little, you know, you know, poke you, you know, a little bit, you know.

**Speaker A:** He likes passive-aggressive, right? Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. And, and that used to really bother me, you know.

**Speaker A:** He's got a dagger, not a, not a, a shotgun, right?

**Speaker B:** I, I got it, right, right. Used to really bother me, and Didn't bother me at all, not even a little bit. I just made some jokes and I played along with it and had my own little jokes to fire back and smoothed out the situation. It felt much better. And I hadn't seen him in 2 years, you know, but to compare how I felt this time compared to 2 years ago, last time I saw him, it was total night and day difference. You know, it was really something.

**Speaker A:** And I imagine that you also began to recognize that because there was a new kid playing the game that the whole game had changed for the whole crowd.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, yes. And it was just a very relaxed, much more relaxed feeling than how I felt being around this, this, this family member in the past.

**Speaker A:** So what you were doing was very similar to an episode that, that I had seen, and I was just wanting to check that out because this is what happened. There were 4 Catholic nuns all dressed to the nines, only way Catholic nuns can dress. I think that there was 3 nuns and they had 4 babies. And they had just— so this is a flight from Seoul, Korea, because I was coming from Thailand, picked up a flight from Seoul, Korea, and here's these nuns sitting right in the vicinity with 4 babies. Taking them to adoption in the US or something like that. And it was clear these nuns were not very good at taking care of babies, but that was their job. And so here they are, and they had one too many anyway, and so none of the kids were getting any of the kind attention they needed for being on a long-haul flight. All of them infants in swaddling clothes. And so here I am in my Buddhist robes and I stand up and I go and ask, is it okay if I hold one of the babies? And so now I'm standing on, you know, in the airplane and rocking it back and forth and I can finally get this one settled down.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And once I got that one, that kid settled down, within 10 minutes those 3 nuns had a chance to relax because they didn't have any babies. And those babies went all over that airplane. That was a community. I, I was— I didn't know it at the time what was happening, but I was creating a Sangha right there, turning a situation that was desperate. I mean, the people on that plane did not like it. Long-haul flight, 4 babies cry, cry, cry. The nurses can't do anything, or the nuns can't do anything about it because they don't have the skills to do it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** The next thing you know, every child is well cared for. There's enough women on those planes, that plane, to know what to do, and the kids, you know. And so that's exactly what happens. We do have that kind of ability to go in and just add some wholesomeness to a tense situation, and the whole thing will change.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely.

**Speaker A:** And I think that if you reflect upon it, you'll see that, yeah, compared to the last year or two years ago and now, this was a much better situation, not just for me, but the joy was spreading around, that everybody was able to get along better because you were giving at least them one example of someone who was not freaked out. About this guy going around jabbing everybody with his dagger, right?

**Speaker B:** Right. Yeah, no, it, it makes a big difference, you know. And like, uh, you know, one place I'd really see that is in the ceremonies, you know, because everyone's just way out, you know, you know, you know how it is. And, you know, and, and, um, you know, I've been a meditator for a while now you know, and I think I've gotten a lot better since we've been working together. Um, but, um, and so thank you very much.

**Speaker A:** Oh, that's clear to see. It really is clear to see. I congratulate you on making progress, Robert. I can tell.

**Speaker B:** Thank you very much. Well, thank you. It wouldn't, wouldn't have done it without you, so I really appreciate it.

**Speaker A:** Well, I'm just watching here, but I gotta let you know I'm watching.

**Speaker B:** All right, thanks. Noted. But, um, then, you know, I remember, like, um, you know, often I'd sit in ceremonies, and, and I used to sit with this one particular group where they would have the ceremony in this, in this room. It's like a living room, and it's, it's like a medium-sized room. I wouldn't call it a small room, but it's definitely not a big room. It's kind of medium-sized room. And, um, and, uh, I would sit it with maybe 3 or 4 people on the same side of the wall with me. And because I'd go in my meditation kind of attitude, you know, just, just, you know, sitting with it, you know, that whole wall that I would be on would often be much more relaxed than the wall on the opposite side of the room where they didn't have someone like that over there, you know. And so that wall would be going crazy And I noticed this many times, like my little area with whatever skills I had, you know, at that time was able to be more mellow than other areas. And it was really fun to kind of see that, you know, and not to toot my own horn or anything, but just a little share.

**Speaker A:** What you're talking about is the same effect that I was with the babies on that airplane. It's the same effect.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And those people over there, they'd be screaming and crying and all You know, it'd be something. But anyway, yeah, like, like babies, right? You know, but

**Speaker A:** it shows how susceptible we are. And that is in fact the whole concept that within Buddhism that is Mudita. Yes, most specifically. And the Brahma Viharas in general. This is what Metta really is, is working at that level of Mudita so that you begin to change the vibrations. Let us say that— yeah, that the

**Speaker B:** people— then great story, I'll tell you.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well anyway, uh, the, the example that I would use is a regular minor chord. By adding a new note to it, changes the flavor of that minor chord completely.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, by adding a new note, it's already a sour note or a sour chord, but you can add a new note and sweeten it Yeah, that's the quality of music. And we can see that that's also true in the sense of music with the sympathetic vibrations, that things harmonize. And so if you come in with notes of joy, then that's going to change the frequencies and the vibrations of people in the room. The question is, do you have enough of that to actually dominate the room? Can you take over the full room? I've had conversations with several students at times when they had the opportunity to just take the whole room over. They ran the show with their joy. Get everybody joyful, crack up the whole crowd. They didn't come for a comedian, but they certainly got one. They loved it. Okay, so this is the idea then, is you can really lighten things up. If you're a mind to, if you can remember to. And that, that is especially useful when you've got one person who is angry, because now if you have enough— you see, normally people's anger is a sufficiently large enough expression so that he can get other people to be angry with him. They will follow his vibrations. But if you've got your own Then you can come back in with your own harmonizing with him and change his tune from a sour note into cheering him up.

**Speaker B:** Right. Okay. I got two other good stories for you. So, and they both involve the Dalai Lama. So, so one is I was at a ceremony and, and I, I had had several cups of medicine, you know, and I go over next to this giant fire and I sit down and there's this woman next to me just screaming. And like, if you— like, not right next to me, like maybe like, you know, like a foot or two feet away.

**Speaker A:** And, and she's not enjoying her moment, huh? I, I hear you telling

**Speaker B:** me that.

**Speaker A:** She's not her age.

**Speaker B:** She's just screaming. And it wasn't the good kind of screaming, you know. It was like not happy. And so I asked the organizer, you know, is it okay if I play a song on the stereo or whatever? And she said, okay, sure. And I said, you know, I listened to this album. It was by this artist, Dewang Khechog, who's this famous Tibetan flutist. And he made an album with His Holiness the Dalai Lama together. And it's a great— it's a very beautiful album of the Tibetan flute and the Dalai Lama praying. And I was able to find this on YouTube.

**Speaker A:** Oh, the music to save the savage soul. So you played this for this lady who was screaming, and it calmed her right down. Isn't that amazing?

**Speaker B:** It was amazing. It came over the speakers and she had no idea what I was playing, but the energy was really intense. And then this calm flute just comes in and the Dalai Lama is praying his soft, nice prayer, and she stopped immediately. She just stopped screaming. She just calmed way down. All the energy calmed way down. It was really cool. It was really cool.

**Speaker A:** And, um, this is called Mudita, sympathetic vibration. So she, she stopped vibrating at the level she was vibrating and started vibrating to a cooler vibration, soothing, calm. Isn't that interesting? That's exactly right. You have that kind of effect. This is another way that we can say it, though it doesn't seem to be quite the same. But on the children's ward in middle December, the kids there are unhappy children to be in the hospital. And then somebody comes in dressed as Santa Claus that knows how to play the part, right? Tathagata. And there is more healing going on in that hospital right that very moment than any nurse or doctor can do. Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. That joy, bringing joy into it, and all of a sudden the kids forget all about their misery and their suffering, and they can't go here and do that or whatever like that. So joy, actually, rather than having an MD, I would rather have an RD behind my name.

**Speaker B:** RD.

**Speaker A:** Yes, Reader's Digest, in the sense of laughter is the best medicine. That was a long ongoing article, laughter is the best medicine, and it really is. Laughter is in fact the best medicine, but we're talking about it not in the sense of hahaha as laughter, but in the sense of spreading joy.

**Speaker B:** Yep, yep. You know, it's funny, it's one reason— and this is my other story of the Dalai Lama, it's kind of a two-part story— but it's one reason I got this Dalai Lama picture, you know, is just, it's just a joyful picture. He's smiling, it looks like he's about to laugh, you know. And I just really— it looks like

**Speaker A:** that they cut, they snapped the photo between laughs.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, you can see like he's

**Speaker A:** just like— Yeah, he's a very jolly guy. I've been around him. I've seen him. Yeah, he's just like the Kabuto Dharma.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and it's funny, you know, because the reason I got this picture is one of my friends who has these San Pedro cactus ceremonies told me this great story. Our mother is very Catholic. Book, and she got her this poster of the Dalai Lama, and she would just sit there crying sometimes next to this poster. And she asked her mother, you know, like, Mom, why are you crying? She said, he's just such a beautiful man, you know.

**Speaker A:** Well, she should laugh at that, not cry.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. But you know what, it was really affecting her. And so I got— I was like, you know, that's a nice story. So I got one for myself, and I got one for my dad and for my mom too. And my dad is someone that is very cynical and loves to criticize and negative thoughts all the time.

**Speaker A:** I wonder where you got all of that. I could have guessed that. I could have guessed that. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And And he loves to talk about how people are screwing him over all the time. And he's a, he's a self-made businessman, you know. And so, um, so he just, you know, part of that whole lifestyle he's chosen is to have people trying to screw him over all the time, you know, and get his money and this and that, you know.

**Speaker A:** And so, well, that's, that's what business is. Business in every regard that I know is what businessman can make deals with other businessmen so that one of them gets screwed by the other. That's what business is all about.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, my dad, he even says that kind of thing. Like he said, you know, everyone's stealing from you, so you got to steal a little bit as well.

**Speaker A:** He likes to— well, that's not always the case. Sometimes there's windfalls in the sense that you didn't intend to steal it. And they didn't know you stole it, but it happened and here it is. We call that a windfall.

**Speaker B:** Right. Well, like his version of that might be like he'd buy bottled water for $0.29 and then he'd turn around and sell it for $2.99, you know, and he'd be like, you know, they don't know that I'm buying this for $0.29. You know, they have no idea. But exactly, buying it, you know, they're buying it for $2.99, so I'm happy, you know. And that was his whole— but you know, it's funny because I got him this Dalai Lama picture and I said, you know, Dad, like, if you're ever having a bad day, you know, you feel you get, you know, like, uh, like, uh, your— the technical support team for your car, you know, they screwed you over, this screwed you over, that screwed you over. You can just look at this Dalai Lama picture, you know, and I hope it just helps you have some faith in humanity.

**Speaker A:** And I hope he remembers to look at it because, I mean, you're actually just teaching him Anapanasati with a picture frame. Yeah, you know, you could have said just take a deep breath and enjoy the photo, and that's full Anapanasati right there. All he has to do is remember it, and that's easy to do if he keeps the photo of the Dalai Lama there on his desk. That's Pretty wholesome.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. And I hope he makes use of that. I don't know, I haven't talked to him for a few months, but I hope he makes use of it. But

**Speaker A:** yeah, anything that we can use as a reminder to remember that it's okay to be happy. Yeah, yeah, you know, you don't have to wait until the work's done in order to be happy. If we wait until the work's done, we're never happy. We'll be dead before we're happy because there's never end to the work. Yeah, so don't worry, be happy.

**Speaker B:** Don't worry, be happy. And that actually would take us into right livelihood.

**Speaker A:** All right, let's do that next time. I think that we've pretty well covered it, at least enough to know that we're going to start working on keeping things wholesome and investigating what's wholesome. Yes, including how the mind works, what the aggregates are, uh, in the sense of what is consciousness, what is perception, so that you begin to get a handle on it because you can see your, your mind in operation. This is the state of mind that we want to get into, is so that we're paying attention to only wholesome things. We're not trying to keep the mind out of the gutter It's not in the gutter right now. It's functioning properly. So now let's take a look at it.

**Speaker B:** Sure. And do you recommend I look at any suttas in particular aside from 111?

**Speaker A:** 111 is the one. You go get what this is and understand what we're talking about to begin to see this withering away, the rising and passing away of all these wholesome things. Begin to start watching the mind, how it works. Look at how your investigation Look at the Eightfold Noble Path in that regard, in the 'this is what's happening right now' kind of way of looking at it. This is my intention, this is my Sukkha, this is my Piti. I can see the Piti going up and down, I can see the Sukkha going up and down. I'm actually looking at that stuff as it's happening inside. That's the investigation that we need to do. Is to really get it. Because if you do that, by knowing it very well, you can begin to take control over it. You begin to experiment with it. Not only do you see that this happens and then that happens, we can all— we can say that, oh, that means that I can make that happen and then this will happen.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** And you begin to learn how to control the mind. Right now the mind is completely out of control with most people, and they generally run by instinct. Right, which is often false positives into negative feelings. And here we're making sure that the mind is positive and wholesome and healthy and working function properly. And now we can begin to see how it— that works, how that happens.

**Speaker B:** Right. And you know, one other thing I think is worth mentioning, uh, that has really changed my day-to-day life as part of this practice is I often will just think to myself, you know, like just, you know, walking down the street or whatever, you know, like, you know what, I can do it. Whatever it is I'm going to do today, I can do it. You know, I can do it. You know, like I got this, you know, and it's a very nice, like part of my day, you know, that's, that's Arisen, or it's all going to be okay. You know, it's all good. You know, like that.

**Speaker A:** That really is what Satchmo's song is.

**Speaker B:** And what's Satchmo's song aside from that?

**Speaker A:** What a Wonderful World. I see skies of blue and red roses too. That's a winter song. What a Wonderful World. Now that's the right attitude. We're not talking about how wonderful the world is, we're talking about the attitude. What a wonderful world.

**Speaker B:** Sure, sure. And I wish I had that all the time, but I have it sometimes and it's very nice.

**Speaker A:** Keep going, keep developing the skills, keep looking at it, keep asking the question, do I have skies of blue and red roses too? Is my wonderful world wonderful right now? You hot diggity dog It sure is.

**Speaker B:** Sure, sure.

**Speaker A:** So that's the investigation— make things really wholesome.

**Speaker B:** Sure. So I have another question about all this. So, um, how, how long does this whole process take usually? Like, how did you know? Like, is there kind of a usual timetable?

**Speaker A:** You know, yes, 2 weeks. 2 weeks.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so, uh, 2 weeks.

**Speaker A:** That's what's it— that's how it took, how long it took Shariputra in the Sutta 111, a fortnight. Also in the Sutra number 10 and the Majjhima Nikaya, which is the, uh, Satipatthana Sutta, the Buddha there says that it takes about 7 years But what, never mind about 7 years, we can do it in 7 weeks. Then he says, never mind 7 weeks, you could do this in 7 days, and you can double the speed that Theraputta did it because it took him 2 weeks. Okay, so if it's taking years and years and years, that means that students is doing something wrong. If we do it right, we can get it done.

**Speaker B:** Sure. Cool.

**Speaker A:** That's how much wholesome stuff you can pile on there. If you pile enough wholesome stuff on there, it'll begin to stick.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** You get the point? I mean, this is something we can say, okay, well, I'll practice and get a little bit today and maybe a tiny little bit tomorrow. Oh no, you pile it on. We're talking about if a steep— if a teaspoon of sugar helps the medicine go down then go buy a 100-pound bag of sugar already. You get the point? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Overdo the joy, intentionally overdo it. Exuberance.

**Speaker B:** Okay, sounds good. And oh, here's another question I thought of.

**Speaker A:** Enough already. All right, all right, well, tomorrow Tomorrow.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay. All right, next time.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And oh, okay, one, one last topic, maybe without the video recorder for this other topic. Maybe you can save it for tomorrow, but, um, um, okay.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, let's do it tomorrow then.

**Speaker B:** Okay, cool. Tomorrow.

**Speaker A:** All right, all right. Okay, cheers.

**Speaker B:** We'll see you very much. See you soon.

**Speaker A:** Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato with a Sangha friend (Speaker B), centers on the joy and energy of correct meditation practice and how to integrate that state into daily life. Here is a summary of the key themes and instructions:

### **Core Theme: The Joyful, Energizing Nature of Correct Practice**
*   Speaker B reports a breakthrough in their **Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing)** practice: sitting for an hour with sharp, happy, uninterrupted focus. This state was so energizing they didn't feel the need for sleep.
*   Dhammarato confirms this is the hallmark of correct practice—it **energizes the mind and body**, leading to a feeling of being "on top of your game." This aligns with the Buddha's teaching on **wakefulness**.

### **The Two Key Questions for Advanced Practice**
Once this joyful, energetic flow state is achieved, the practitioner must address:
1.  **How do we keep it going?**
2.  **What do we do with it when we have it?**

### **The Foundation: Removing the Hindrances**
*   The first step of practice is always the **removal of unwholesome thoughts (hindrances)** and their replacement with **wholesome thoughts**. This is an active, investigative process—like a "fox hunt"—not passive noting.
*   The goal is to create a mind so pure that only wholesome states are present, allowing for deeper investigation without being "poisoned" by negativity.

### **What to Do With the Wholesome State: Investigation & Mastery**
With a stable, joyful mind, the practice shifts to **investigating the wholesome mind itself**. This is the core of the talk's instruction:
*   **Observe Arising and Passing Away:** Watch the flow of wholesome phenomena (like **piti** - joy/rapture and **sukkha** - happiness/bliss) as they constantly arise and pass away. This leads to insight into impermanence.
*   **Take Control and Experiment:** Learn to consciously "dial up" or "dial down" these joyful states. Move from exuberance (**piti**) to calm contentment (**sukkha**) to deep peace (**upekkha**). This is how you become the "boss" of your mind.
*   **Investigate the Mind's Components:** Examine how the **Five Aggregates** (form, feeling, perception, mental formations, consciousness) operate within this wholesome state. Look at how **Right Effort**, **Mindfulness**, and **Concentration** are functioning in real-time.
*   **Sustain It Off the Cushion:** The ultimate goal is to **maintain this wholesome state during daily activities**. End formal meditation by getting up and moving into your day with the same joy and mindfulness (e.g., walking the dog with metta). Life's irritations (like a dog's accident) become opportunities to practice maintaining your composure and kindness.

### **The Social Power of a Wholesome Mind**
*   The talk includes personal stories illustrating **Mudita (sympathetic joy)** and **Metta (loving-kindness)**.
*   A calm, joyful person can change the "vibration" of a tense social situation, just as calming music can soothe a distressed individual. Your wholesome state acts as a beneficial force for those around you.

### **Practical Advice & Attitude**
*   **Sleep Naturally:** Break free from rigid sleep schedules. Correct practice provides natural energy, allowing for more flexible, awakened hours (e.g., being awake in the tranquil early morning).
*   **Cultivate Confidence:** Use success in practice to build the confidence that "I can handle this" or "it's all good" in daily life.
*   **Overdo the Joy:** Don't be timid. Pile on the wholesome joy intentionally. The path can be rapid ("a fortnight") if one applies this "overdoing" of wholesomeness with correct understanding.

### **Recommended Sutta**
*   **MN 111 (the "Anupada Sutta" or "One by One As They Occurred Sutta")** is highlighted as the essential text for understanding this stage of observing the arising and passing away of wholesome mental factors.

In essence, this talk guides a practitioner from achieving a joyful, concentrated state to using that state as a laboratory for deep insight and as a foundation for a seamlessly integrated, compassionate, and awakened life. The emphasis is on active mastery, joyful investigation, and spreading that wholesomeness into the world.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate the principles of meditation practice, mindfulness, and living a wholesome life. Here is a breakdown:

---

### **Metaphors**

1. **Fox Hunt vs. Whack-a-Mole**  
   - **Speaker A** contrasts two approaches to dealing with unwholesome thoughts:  
     - *Fox hunt*: Intentionally seeking out and removing unwholesome thoughts.  
     - *Whack-a-mole*: Reactively noting whatever arises without specific intention.  
   - This highlights the proactive, focused nature of their practice.

2. **Building a Foundation vs. Sitting in a Hut**  
   - **Speaker A** critiques the cultural tendency to constantly build upon the past (“building a higher and bigger building”) and contrasts it with the simplicity of being “comfortable and happy sitting in a hut.”  
   - This metaphor emphasizes contentment in the present moment versus endless striving.

3. **Burning by Day, Smoldering by Night**  
   - Used to describe how the mind’s disturbances continue even during sleep (dreaming).  
   - Meditation before sleep helps “empty the mind” so it can rest properly.

4. **Playing with Your Day Like a Toy**  
   - When mindfulness energizes you, you can treat your day flexibly and joyfully rather than as a rigid routine.

5. **Adding a Note to a Chord**  
   - **Speaker A** compares bringing wholesome energy into a group to adding a new musical note that changes a sour chord into something harmonious.  
   - This illustrates how one person’s joyful presence can shift the emotional tone of a social situation.

6. **Who’s the Lion?**  
   - A metaphor for self-mastery and confidence: “Who’s the boss here anyway? Who’s the lion?”  
   - Represents taking control of your mind and life.

7. **Poisoning Your Own Brew**  
   - Allowing unwholesome thoughts is like poisoning your own life.  
   - Emphasizes the importance of guarding the mind.

8. **100-Pound Bag of Sugar**  
   - If a little joy helps, “overdo the joy”—pile it on intentionally.  
   - Encourages exuberance and abundant wholesome states.

1. **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and the Patimokkha Night**  
   - **Speaker A** shares how monks stay up all night before the Patimokkha recitation, with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa teaching from 2 a.m. until sunrise.  
   - This story models using nighttime for practice and illustrates natural sleep patterns freed from industrial schedules.

2. **The Nuns and Babies on the Airplane**  
   - **Speaker A** recounts a flight where he (in Buddhist robes) helped calm crying babies being escorted by nuns, which then encouraged others to help, creating a spontaneous “Sangha.”  
   - Demonstrates how one person’s compassionate action can transform a stressful situation.

3. **Speaker B’s Archaeological Dream**  
   - **Speaker B** shares a dream about driving off a highway to explore ruins, which **Speaker A** links to “psychological archaeology”—over-attachment to analyzing the past.

     - Playing a recording of the Dalai Lama praying with Tibetan flute music to calm a distressed woman at a ceremony.  
     - Giving his cynical father a picture of the smiling Dalai Lama as a reminder of joy and faith in humanity.  
   - Both stories show how wholesome symbols and vibrations can shift emotional states.

6. **Dealing with a Critical Uncle**  
   - **Speaker B** describes how his improved mindfulness helped him respond playfully to a passive-aggressive relative, defusing tension and improving the family dynamic.  
   - A real-life example of applying meditation skills in social situations.

7. **The Dog Diarrhea Incident**
