### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Hello folks, today is a new year. It's January 2nd, and we will be talking today about First Jhana and its features and prerequisites. Now, always the way to get started is by saying two things. First off, the Buddha in Sutta number 36 said that the first Jhana is the path. Now, uh, it is true that there are four Jhanas, and taken as a group, they're almost always referred to as the Jhanas. And, uh, in several places In several places are referred to as pleasant abiding, but the first Jhana is always referred to as something separate because the first Jhana is all that's needed to get into that state of pleasant abiding. The second point to talk about is that in this context, what the Buddha actually taught was referred to as Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. That's basically all he taught. It's possible that some monks will grab every stick and every leaf and every piece of stuff that they find that's got Buddhism plastered on it and say that the Buddha taught that too. But that's not the case. When the Buddha says he only teaches one thing, he actually means that. In other words, there is no reason for cosmology. There's no reason for, let us say, psychotherapy. There's no reason to need anything about rebirth and reincarnation because everything about the teaching of the Buddha happens right here, right now, in the present moment. So given from that, the Buddhist teaching says, I only teach one thing, and that is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Now that means immediately to come out of our dissatisfaction. Satisfaction, you could say that it's actually referred to as dissatisfaction and satisfaction. Things are to be seen in that kind of duality. And the dissatisfaction, or Dukkha, is what we normally experience a lot. Everybody has dissatisfaction. You could actually, from the history of religion, you could see that religions got started because people were not satisfied with their lives. They wanted something else, something more. And religions were started in order to give them something else, something more. But the religions always failed. They didn't find the solution to the problem. And so religions then evolved into— as long as these people are already suffering 'Let's see if we can make some money off of them. Let's have some rituals. Let's sell them some products. Let's see if we can capitalize on that.' And that's what turned into the major religions. In other words, scams, charlatanism. And one of the major qualities of these charlatans is to teach that you cannot come out of your dissatisfaction and your disappointments, Dukkha. You can't do it, not alone. In fact, the only way that you can do it is through our help. Most specifically, you need a savior, you need a guru, you need a teacher. You need a psychologist, you need a doctor, but rarely do the doctors ever bring people out of their Dukkha. They may be able to cure an illness, but then the person will suffer in good health. So the teachings of the Buddha is really not religion at all. It is the exact thing of coming out of our dissatisfactions into a state of satisfaction. So with that, we can unpack that into what is referred to as the Four Noble Truths. Now, the First Noble Truth is in fact that there is Dukkha, there is dissatisfaction, disappointment. It exists. It exists in everyone. You could say that it comes from two different ways. One is that in a way it's built right into our DNA. It's built into our self-preservation instinct, into our nesting instinct, into our territorial instinct, into our procreation instinct. But as a child is born with that and then raised, he is and she is raised into more Dukkha. Because now we get the entire culture's version, the entire family's version of Dukkha, and so the Dukkha kind of gets set in as a habit. And so the real practice that the Buddha gave is to come out of that state of dissatisfaction, and we can do it immediately. All we need to do is see one little thing, see the Dukkha itself. So, the next point is the Second Noble Truth: What is the cause of Dukkha? And the cause of Dukkha is not someplace on the outside. It's someplace that comes from within us and is closely related to feelings. The words of Maha Lobhadosa actually translate quite well into lust, ill will, and ignorance. That word ignorance, by the way, is kind of a feeling also, just like lust or greed is actually not just a pleasant sensation, but it is wanting something. So we add this flavor to it called Tanha. And so when Tanha is added to feelings, that's where the basis for Dukkha comes in. We can have a pleasant feeling and just enjoy that pleasant feeling, or we can have an unpleasant feeling and just be okay with it. Or we don't know something and we know we don't know it, and that's okay. But when we add that craving, that thirst to it, So the example is, is that you're, uh, you have the thought of you're thirsty. If there is water right there, then you take a drink of water and it's over. But if you're thirsty and there is no water, now that's the source of dissatisfaction. You want something that you don't have. Now the Third Noble Truth is actually seeing that dissatisfaction, that disappointment, that suffering, seeing it as it is, recognizing that you're the one who created it. It didn't come from the outside, and that if we can make a certain kind of change, then we can come out of that dissatisfaction. Now, what we're actually talking about here is right from the very beginning, The Buddhist teaching discussion with Dhammarato. The Buddhist teaching of the Buddha is a change model, and that the first major change that one has to make is the attitude of my dissatisfaction, my loneliness, my disappointment does not come from the outside. It does not come from not getting what I want. The dissatisfaction is something that I'm doing inside. And so the major change that has to be made right from the very beginning is to come out of blaming any and everything on the outside world and start taking responsibility for the fact that all of the disappointment, dissatisfaction, unhappiness, and everything is something that we're creating within us. And so that major change is turning from the outside to inward. And that you can see that the society teaches everybody to go find their happiness and their joy somewhere on the outside, to buy a new car, to get a new wife, to get a new house, to get a new job, to get a new education. To get something so that we can be satisfied, but that kind of satisfaction doesn't last at all. We're talking about change that actually leads to long-term satisfaction. So the Fourth Noble Truth is where we get started with this, and that is that there is a path or a method that will bring about this state of joy. And that in fact that path is a path of change, to make some changes inside. So the first point that's to be made is that there is a word called Sati that is mistranslated into mindfulness, but it has a better usage by using it as the word memory, but not memory of the past, but rather the memory to remember to be right here in this present moment, to be able to come to the present moment so that we can see what is in the present moment, to see our dissatisfactions, our disappointments that are happening right now. And so this is all what it is, is to remember to look and to see. And once we look and see and can see these dissatisfactions, now it's time to change. Now, uh, the Buddha had 4 kinds of change, 4 right noble efforts. The effort, in fact, is to minimize and to destroy unwholesome thoughts, feelings, attitudes, etc. And the second two is to foster and increase wholesome states. So the two divisions are to wholesome and unwholesome, and the actions are to minimize and destroy versus to cultivate and to increase. And this is something that we do with the practice. And as we do this, we begin to gain some skill. So, to remember to be in this present moment is a skill to be developed. We have to keep practicing to remember to be in the present moment. Also, this looking becomes a skill, and the skill primarily is the skill of discernment or discrimination, so that we can discriminate between Dukkha, and what is not Dukkha. Now there are many practices where they want to take the Dukkha and examine it and see it in great detail, but the Buddha said no, all we need to do is to label it and see that it's unwholesome, it's unsatisfactory, and then we make a change immediately. In other words, there's no reason for evaluation. There's no reason to dissect it. And yet many practices that are under the name of Buddhism, especially insight and mindfulness meditations, expect the students to merely observe, observe, observe, and observe with the idea that if you can see Dukkha well enough, then naturally you'll move away from it. But that's not the Buddhist teaching discussion. We're not looking at a natural progression. We're looking at right effort to make a change. So without going too much further into what is called the Eightfold Noble Path, we'll mention one more, and that is Samma Sanghappa, which has to do with right intention or right attitude. And that actually has to do with building confidence, because once you start to practice and become in a state where there is no Dukkha and you become satisfied, that satisfaction begins to grow. In the case of you become confident that you can do it over and over again. Now, much of what I've been saying today comes out of one sutta, the Majjhima Nikaya 117, but it has a companion, and that is the Anapanasati Sutta out of the Majjhima Nikaya number 118. And here we're going to practice the Eightfold Noble Path through the practice of Anapanasati. Now many people think that, oh, Anapanasati, that's a breathing meditation, but that's not correct. That in fact it has to do with all four foundations: the body, the feelings. In other words, you can do breath meditations for many, many weeks, months, or years, and if you haven't changed the way that you feel, you haven't gained anything. If you haven't changed your attitude, you haven't gained anything. If you don't change your thoughts, you haven't changed anything. So the breathing is not what this practice is. It is a change model, and that in the mind, where the first big change to make is called gladdening the mind. Now, this gladdening the mind actually means not just to change the thoughts themselves, but to actually change the working attitude that we have, the state of mind. And with that change in the state of mind, we then can begin to change also our feelings. Now, with that as a base, let's introduce the first Jhana, that in fact it can be said by those who really understand the Anapanasati Sutta It is a map or a pathway into the first jhana. Now, the first quality of the first jhana is to be free from obstructions or hindrances or unwholesome thoughts. In other words, we have been successful at changing the thought process that we have so that we're not having any unwholesome thoughts. We're having wholesome thoughts, happy thoughts. With that, we can then begin to see that the next quality is by having those wholesome thoughts over and over and over and over again, we do develop this attitude of success. I can do this. With that, we then continue to practice, and this is where the feelings come in, in the sense of we practice to change the mind's thoughts from fear into safety and security. We begin to have wholesome thoughts about everything is all right, Everything is fine. When we continue to do that, we are working with the body, begin to feel comfortable, and then actually after we feel safe and secure and comfortable, we add that quality of satisfaction. Now satisfaction is exactly opposite of Dukkha, dissatisfaction. That in fact the word Sukkha in the Pali is exactly opposite of the word Dukkha in the Pali. And so this is why it's easy enough to see why the Buddha says that all we need for the path is the first Jhana, because all we need to do is to change that Dukkha into Sukkha. Into satisfaction. Now as we continue to practice, that sankhara gains confidence, great confidence, so that we begin to see that state of, "Wow, I can do this. I can continue to practice. There is nothing that's going to stop me from practicing. I'm going to develop the habit and continue to do it. So now we can say that there is a new kind of change happening, and that is what could be referred to as a lifestyle change, because now we're no longer interested in gaining things from the outside world. We're now seeing that everything that we do need can be had from the inside through proper training. Now one of the interesting things about the Anapanasati Sutta is that every item on the list has the little phrase of "thus one trains oneself." So gladdening the mind is a training, it's a skill to continue to gladden the mind, just like Sati is a skill to be developed. Thus one trains oneself to remember to look, change, and that change is gladdening the mind. And with that gladdening the mind over and over again, we begin to gain the confidence that we can do this. All right, so now we've covered parts of Jhana. Let's add the next item to it, which would be The part is called Piti. Now, Piti is actually kind of a wow sensation. It's a kind of over-the-top happiness. So instead of just being satisfied, we actually have that wow, I can do this, which is actually now changing the word satisfaction into success. We know that we can do this, and when we bring that Piti into it, we now have.

**Speaker B:** 3.

**Speaker A:** Of the first Jhana factors. Now, we have already been practicing the other 2, and they are referred to as Applied and Sustained. Sometimes we use the word thought, applied thought and sustained thought, but you could also say that it's applying an attitude and sustaining the attitude. So applying the mind means that you keep coming back, you keep coming back, you keep coming back to the sequence of remember to look and to change. Remember to look and to change and to congratulate yourself over and over and over again. This is how we keep applying the mind, and fairly soon this application becomes sustaining in the sense that every wholesome thought is not coming out of a cloud of unwholesome thoughts but it winds up being one wholesome thought after another after another. These are the factors of the Jhana. Now let me ask you the question, and that is, is that if you are in a sustained state of being satisfied, joyful, what then is left? What else do you need? Other than being satisfied and joyful moment by moment, over and over again. A lot of people will say, "Oh, well, we need Nibbana." Well, what is Nibbana? What is Nibbana is nothing more than that state of no longer struggling, no longer wanting anything. But in fact being satisfied with the way things are. Other people will say, well, what about enlightenment? Well, here's a question for you: would you prefer to be enlightened but still want a bunch of stuff, or would you be satisfied even if you didn't use the word enlightened. You can just be satisfied with the way things are. So, uh, in, in a way, this word enlightenment is not necessary. What we do have is words like boo, Budo, Buddha. And this word boo, or po in Pali, or excuse me, in Thai, is actually the waking up that we have been practicing all along. The waking up is to remember to look, remember to look, and when we look and look and look, we can see and we can see clearly. By seeing clearly what the Dukkha is and what the Dukkha is not, we can make that change. So remember that this is a change model, and the change is from states of unwholesome, that we diminish and reduce and eliminate those, and make sure that they don't come back, while at the same time we're increasing and building and fostering feelings of goodwill, of cheer, of happiness, of joy, of wholesome thoughts. This is basically all there is to the entire practice of the Buddha. I know that there's a lot of bolt-ons, but this is your basic transportation. This will get you anywhere you need to go without all of the other stuff. Now, one of the things that happens is these unwholesome thoughts or these hindrances will prevent people from getting started immediately. One of the hindrances is remorse. And anytime that you have thoughts about the past, more than likely you're going to find something wrong with the past. Woulda, shoulda, couldas, remorse— oh, I shouldn't have done that, etc. Like that. Can you actually see that remorseful thought and say, wait a minute, that's in the past. And right here and right now is good enough. This is really fine right here, right now. And so we come back into the present moment and we come out of those remorseful thoughts rather than ruminating. And that many people, in fact, you'll all probably recollect shortly that you do think about the past, and sometimes that past burns. It's almost like, aha! That remorse is strong. It's so strong that it's often referred to as being in hell. Why? Because you can't do anything about the past except hurt. Or the other thing that you can do is to drop the past completely and just come into the present moment. Another one would be doubt, and I would say that doubt is probably the major reason why people don't make a lot of immediate improvements. An example of that would be that when the teacher says, "It's time for you to practice right now, you've already got what you need to practice right now," then mind will come up, "Well, what about this, and what about that?" In other words, we want to try to get it right before we ever try doing it. That's like saying that the young piano student, maybe a first or second grader, is sitting down at the piano, and because he cannot play Chopin or Chopin waltz, he's not going to play the piano at all. He's not going to start with chopsticks. But we need to start someplace, and we need to start. That's the important thing, is to start to practice correctly. And the major issue of starting correctly is to remember to look and to take the effort to make a change, and then congratulate yourself for making that change. Those little four things are all on the Eightfold Noble Path. If you do those four things, by having those unwholesome thoughts coming out of the mind, the mind will settle down. In fact, it will become collected together. Another example is that many people are hard on themselves by criticizing. Like saying, "Oh, this is hard," "Oh, you can't do that," and this could be seen as a set of rules or rituals or would-haves or shoulds, coulds, ought-tos, standards, and other things like this that says, "I'm not ready, I'm not good enough yet." These are thoughts that will prevent one from practicing. So if you can see those thoughts of, "Oh, this is hard," or, "I wish I could do it better," we can change those thoughts immediately to, "Oh, well, right now is good enough. Right now is good enough." And keep practicing that everything is okay right now. These are the kinds of things that we need to see. Is to see the doubt that prevents us from practicing, the remorse that clouds the mind and makes us feel not worthy, not good enough, and also these sets of rules and our reactions to them. So if we practice correctly, that means we start to practice immediately. What I would suggest right now for everybody on this group is to start paying attention to the kind of thoughts that you have that are outside of the actual words that are being used, and start thinking about, or actually investigating, remembering to look at the kind of thoughts that you do have that are old habit thoughts that are not part of the practice and make that change right here, right now, to get used to starting to change your mind in this present moment. Because that's where the practice is. It's always right here, right now. And I'm sure that everybody would admit that while this talk has been going on, the mind has wandered back into the past, has wandered into the future, has wandered into discomforts, etc., like that. So while we're having this talk, let's keep the mind focused on everything is all right, everything is fine, not a problem in the world, everything is okay right here in this moment. If we can practice that over and over and over again, we begin to feel really good, we begin to feel successful. That's the quality that we're looking for, is feeling secure, safe, satisfied. And that satisfaction then leads over and over again into a state of success. This is not hard. This is easy to do, but we have to keep after it over and over again. If you don't do anything other than this one little process You don't need anything else. This is all you need to do. We need to practice it over and over and over again, that everything is all right right now. I have been spending my whole life, some people say, trying to find out what's wrong with things so that I could fix it, to where all we need to do is see that trying to fix it is the problem. And then I can drop that and see right now that everything is already okay. In the mind, everything is fine. So let's see if anybody has any questions about this. Matt, I'll pick on you first because I see you with a great big smile on your face. What do you think?

**Speaker C:** Uh, I really resonate with the, the last part you were saying about thinking, whoa, spending a whole life like trying to figure out what's wrong and then suddenly realizing that trying to figure out what's wrong is what's wrong and that I can just drop it. Yeah, I don't think I have any questions. This, I feel like this is a really, really nice synopsis of the practice as you've described it before, as I understand it.

**Speaker A:** Very good. So, let's see, how about you, Naved? What do you think?

**Speaker D:** It definitely applies right now. So, I really appreciate it. Really?

**Speaker A:** Yes, right now is the time to practice, and you've got a whole lot of right nows. Okay, most people in the West have an idea that Buddhism is all about squatting on the floor in a particular place and that they'll always postpone it. There was a telephone call between our friend Cat, who is now ordained as a monk, and he was talking to a very famous English meditation teacher. And in this call, she says that she still has defilements and that she's planning on going into a retreat so that she can work on these defilements that she still has. She's going to go into a deep meditation. Well, what she's missing is the fact that when that defilement came up on that phone call, that was the time to become aware of it, to see it, and to change it. And to change that defilement: "Aha, I see you, Mr. Defilement, and right now, out you go." But instead, she had this quality of postponing it until she can have a deep practice. The Buddha didn't teach a deep practice. This state of the first Jhana is in fact a light practice. It's not a deep practice at all. It's very enlightening. So Dan, yes, go ahead.

**Speaker E:** I didn't— it was incidental with the hand, but I like the I like the simplicity of that practice. It's all actually what I'm looking for.

**Speaker A:** Yes, so practice.

**Speaker E:** Be content.

**Speaker A:** Be content right now to practice being content. This is not something that we go someplace to do. This is not a retreat. This is not 10 days off with 90 or another 100 people, all of them practicing the same rituals, the same low lighting, all looking for an experience. In fact, that's one of the major issues that you'll find with the Western mind. They think that if they have some sort of experience, then that experience will be an enlightening experience and they'll gain something. To where actually this practice that we're talking about right here, Dan, is all a dead loss. What are we going to lose? We're going to lose our discomfort. We're going to lose our dissatisfaction. We're going to lose our unwholesome thoughts. We're just going to put them down, but we're not expecting to gain anything. It's sort of like if you put the weights down, you'll immediately feel light. And so this is a really important practice that has over the ages been changed by various monks and various meditation teachers to turn it into a business where nobody really gets any complete immediate relief, but they keep coming back. Because they want to go deep into meditation, as opposed to this practice. All you have to do is keep remembering. You can be on your way to the grocery store and you'll have unwholesome thoughts. I bet the prices are really high, and you haven't even gotten into the store yet. Instead, you can immediately see, aha, I see that worry about high prices, and right now I feel great. If we can remember to stay in this present moment and experience the way things actually are right now, everything is already okay. And so this is not a meditation practice. This is the practice of remembering to see what the mind is doing. This is a walking around practice. This is a practice that you can do lying down. This is a practice that you can do standing. In fact, this is the best thing to do when you're standing in line, standing in line for a bus or at the airport or at the bank, whatever you're doing. And you'll notice that people who are standing in line are almost always miserable, not because of what they're doing right now, but because of what they have to do in the next 10 or 20 minutes. And so when you're standing, stand happily. Right now I'm standing and everything is all right. Or I'm sitting and everything is all right. Or I'm laying in the bed, or I'm laying on the ground. Whatever I'm doing, whatever posture I'm in, now's a good time to remember to practice. Now, one of the mistakes that people make with this, Dan, is to change that "remember to practice" into "you have to always remember." You have to always do this. And so as soon as you remember to do it, the remorse will come up: "Oh, I wasn't practicing for 10 minutes." "I wasn't practicing for 2 weeks." "I wasn't practicing this month." Guess what? That's an unwholesome thought. The right thought to have is, "Hot dog, I remembered to practice right now. Never mind about the past. Now is good enough." And so we do not need a procedure, we do not need a special place, all we need to do is to remember happily that right now everything is okay. What do you think about that, Dan?

**Speaker E:** That sounds good. Sounds very good.

**Speaker A:** All right. Yes, Mr. Ben, what do you think? How about you, Sean? What do you think about this?

**Speaker F:** Yeah, thank you. I really appreciated the talk tonight. I felt like I needed a recap on the fundamentals, you know, and yeah, Not to kick my own ass here with the like, oh, I was supposed to always be doing this the whole time and I took 2 weeks off and things haven't been that great. Um, that is kind of what feels like it has happened and I'm like looking forward to just being cool with how things are right now and not, not even thinking about the last 2 weeks. Um, I did, I did have one question. I'm sure you probably wanna respond to that. Um, but like. I think it's for me, and this is, I don't know, probably new Western ideas. I realize it's not from directly from the Anapanasati or anything, but like I do notice that like from the like advice that I've been getting throughout the last several years of mental health stuff, like one thing that is kind of helpful is to like kind of let a thought be there rather than like forcing it out. And like, I think that the, the, that comes from a place of like not going to war with oneself, you know, not being like, and I guess, I mean, I don't know, I suppose there's a way to be like, okay, thank you for that thought. Now we're just going to think it's okay right now, right? Because that thought's already in the past. So there's no need to like, like the quote, changing a thought isn't actually like we aren't actually changing the past because the thoughts already come. So maybe these ideas are actually like not as incongruent as I think. It's more about like, what's the next thought? Like, let's think something better now. You know, we don't have to go down that path and think another thought along the lines of like, yeah, remorse or like what if. Bad things, etc.

**Speaker A:** You're making a good point there, and that is part of the Western practice that is much more psychology of just be there with it. Well, that's not what the Buddha said. He says that just being there with it in fact is just repeating the unwholesome thought over and over again.— it becomes remorse immediately. That in fact what we need to do instead is to say, "Aha, I see that unwholesome thought, and wow, I'm not going to bother with it. I'm already okay." And so we can change those thoughts. It's not hard to change a thought that in fact If we can think of it like this, going all the way back to Sigmund Freud, he had a practice he called free association, to where he would let his clients just sit on the couch, lie on the couch, and just let their mind spin and say the words, and he'd write all of that stuff down. What that means, free association, is that a thought is temporary. It's very temporary. That in fact, when we repeat a thought, it's a second thought, it's a third thought, and that we have to keep that going in order to maintain that. That the better thing to do is to see that thought as unwholesome and say, "Aha, I caught you!" That in fact, that "aha, I caught you" is already now making a change for the wholesome. And so do not entertain people who say you've got to sit with the thought, because that's just sitting with more unwholesome. Just more unwholesome. So, seeing, don't sit with those thoughts. Go ahead and change them immediately. It's actually quite easy to change it. Once you remember to change.

**Speaker F:** It.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, go ahead.

**Speaker F:** I was just saying, yeah, like, I think the bigger thing is like you've already said it a couple times, like, not— I think the thing that I'm taking from the like concept of not resisting that last thought is that like there's nothing to resist anymore. Like, I can just move on to a better thought now. Like, fighting that thought, fighting that thought is like just more unwholesomeness. Like, being afraid of that thought is more unwholesomeness. Being—.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So this practice actually begins to get very consistent and very easy to do. Once we start practicing. But there's a whole lot of things resistant for us to not practice. So Anna, happy to see you again. What do you have to.

**Speaker G:** Say? I'm here with doubts. So I am not— I don't understand practically, how to deal with a physical or emotional aggression, like in the moment. So you see something, if you see inappropriate behavior, or if somebody trying to hit you, or something in the moment, and then it's somehow glued to you, so you cannot really get rid of it because it's not on the thought level or somehow deeper level. How to clean it up from your consciousness?

**Speaker A:** Well, that comes with the practice of remembering to look, that in fact that often that feeling of resentment also comes with the remorse. And remember that this is something that we do right there in the present moment, even if we're around others. So if somebody criticizes you, you can say, wow, Look how bad I feel about that. And I see that and I don't have to feel bad right now. I can change it. But if I criticize somebody else. Pardon?

**Speaker G:** If I criticize somebody else, so I see some inappropriate behavior in my mind. So what I'm doing with this? I'm kind of unhappy, but it's obviously inappropriate. So what I'm doing with my set of mind then?

**Speaker A:** All right. Change that focus from the person on the outside that is not behaving correctly and change that focus to the inside, perhaps with the thought of, wow, I'm glad I don't do that right now. Wow, I'm all right right now. I don't have to criticize that person. Then let that person do their own criticism, and I'll just be okay. You don't have to fuss at yourself for criticizing someone. You can just say, "Aha, I caught that criticism," and I can just drop it and say, "Wow, everything— I don't have to criticize that dude." I can relax instead. So, Brett, what do you.

**Speaker D:** Think? I think this method points out in the present moment we take responsibility. And a lot of times, if we've been acting in this way, in a way that we would say hindrance-born or in a way that supports the thoughts and concepts that create our suffering, then it's going to come back again. But our responsibility to see that Dukkha is again right here, right now. So I don't have anything to add other than that. But this is some nice Dhamma.

**Speaker A:** Hot dog! Oh, boundless joy to find at last. There is no happiness out there. No, it's just right here, right.

**Speaker D:** Now.

**Speaker A:** That's correct. So Edward, what do you have to.

**Speaker B:** Say? I see that I am not completely free of hindrances. I have remorse. I can see it. Uh, I think, uh, the life is getting lighter. But I guess as I've been practicing, I just see I carry many things, you know. I just, I have heavy things that I carry, and I, but I can see that I'm carrying them. And I like that you phrased gladdening the mind tonight as, hey, can you have goodwill and be cheerful? I hadn't heard that definition yet, and I like it very much. I can try to do that.

**Speaker A:** Or do it. Okay, that's good. So see that remorse and say, aha, I see you. And the best thing that I can say about dealing with remorse is to recognize that, well, that was in the past, and right now is okay. Wow, I really like how things are right now. I don't have to worry about that time I had to fix a hot water heater. I don't have to worry about the time when that cop caught me. I don't have to worry about the time when I had trouble with the visa. Then when those thoughts come up, I can say, wow, I'm so glad that I'm just sitting here on the porch, no place to go and nothing to do. Right now is great. And keep coming back with that. And go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that shit's in the.

**Speaker A:** Past. So Connor, what do you have to.

**Speaker D:** Say?

**Speaker H:** I liked what you said towards the beginning. It seemed to— there was something you said that implied to me that it's like we can recognize right here and right now that we may be unquenched again in the future. Like at some point later on, maybe we'll forget the practice. But that doesn't bring us any closer to being quenched. And so the practice isn't really to have remorse towards even like things that we would consider to be realistic worries. And I think that there's like a, there's a cooling component of that. I like that kind of like cool.

**Speaker A:** Approach. Yes, everything becomes cool. Good for you, Connor. So, Mr. Bhante, are you.

**Speaker D:** On?

**Speaker I:** I am, Arhat.

**Speaker A:** So what do you have to say about the talk today?

**Speaker I:** Yeah, great talk. Thank you. Yeah, we don't have to keep carrying around happy things. We can just put them down here and now. Because as much as they're like deep meditation, life isn't deep. Life's shallow, really. Life's really shallow. Life's just this moment. So we can use thoughts to give it some deep meaning, or we can stop.

**Speaker A:** Doing it. Very good. So does anybody else have anything to say? Anicca. Yeah. All right, Mikey, why don't we take this thing home? Let's do a really complete job this.

**Speaker J:** Time. Yes, thanks friends for being here today. So splendid call. You all are welcome to stay here and hang out and continue to make friends in this noble Sangha. And we encourage people to come join this hangout channel here on the Dharma Friends Discord whenever you'd like.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Thank you. So I'm going to go ahead and go and leave everybody here for you to continue with this call. To continue to make friends with one another and to discuss what we've talked about today. And friendship is really an important part, to have noble friends. Now I know that you have ordinary friends, but ordinary friends have a lot of ordinary problems. Here you're going to be having fun and working with friends who know how to come out of their problems. So thank you all, and I'll see you later.

**Speaker H:** See ya.

**Speaker A:** Thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker E:** Thank you.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A), is a practical guide to the core of Buddhist practice, centered on achieving the **First Jhana** as the essential path to end suffering (*dukkha*). Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Philosophy: The Buddha's One Teaching**
*   The Buddha taught only one thing: **Dukkha and its cessation** (*Dukkha Nirodha*). This is a "change model" for moving from dissatisfaction to satisfaction, happening entirely in the present moment.
*   True practice is not about cosmology, rebirth, or complex psychotherapy. It's a direct, personal practice to end suffering here and now.

### **The Framework: Four Noble Truths & Right Effort**
*   **1st Truth:** Dissatisfaction (*Dukkha*) exists, arising from both instinct and conditioned habits.
*   **2nd Truth:** The cause of *Dukkha* is internal, born from our **craving** (*tanha*) in response to feelings (lust, ill-will, ignorance).
*   **3rd Truth:** We can cease *Dukkha* by recognizing we create it internally and can change that.
*   **4th Truth:** The path is the **Eightfold Noble Path**, emphasizing **right effort**: to abandon unwholesome states and cultivate wholesome ones.
*   **Sati (Mindfulness)** is better understood as **"remembering"**—remembering to be present, to look at the mind, and to make a change.

### **The Practice: First Jhana as the Path**
*   The **First Jhana** is presented as the complete and sufficient path. It is a state of "pleasant abiding" achieved by transforming *dukkha* into *sukkha* (satisfaction).
*   **Prerequisites & Factors:** The path to First Jhana involves:
    1.  **Gladdening the Mind:** Changing thoughts and attitudes from negative to positive, from fear to safety. This builds confidence.
    2.  **Freedom from Hindrances:** Actively removing unwholesome thoughts (remorse, doubt, criticism, sensual desire) as they arise.
    3.  **Applied & Sustained Thought:** Continuously applying the mind to the sequence of **remember → look → change → congratulate**. This becomes a sustained flow of wholesome thoughts.
    4.  **Joy (*Piti*) & Satisfaction (*Sukkha*):** As practice deepens, mere satisfaction blossoms into a joyful "wow" sensation and a confident sense of success.

### **Key Practical Instructions**
*   **Change, Don't Just Observe:** Contrary to some "mindfulness" approaches, the Buddha's method is **active**. See an unwholesome thought, label it, and **immediately change it** to a wholesome one (e.g., "Everything is okay right now"). Do not ruminate or "sit with" the negativity.
*   **Practice Here and Now:** This is not a deep, retreat-only meditation. It's a **"walking around practice"** for any moment—standing in line, driving, working. The present moment is always the place to practice.
*   **Overcome Key Hindrances:**
    *   **Remorse:** Acknowledge past thoughts, then drop them: "That was then, *right now* is okay."
    *   **Doubt:** Don't wait to be perfect. Start the simple practice now, like a child learning "chopsticks" before Chopin.
    *   **Self-Criticism:** Replace "I failed to practice" with "Hot dog! I remembered *right now*!"
*   **Lifestyle Change:** Success leads to a natural disinterest in seeking satisfaction from external things (cars, jobs, status). Lasting joy is found internally.

### **Q&A Highlights**
*   The practice is about **dropping burdens** (like putting down a heavy weight), not about gaining special experiences.
*   **Postponement** (e.g., "I'll deal with my defilements on retreat") is a trap. The moment a defilement arises is the moment to change it.
*   In confrontational situations, shift focus from the other person's behavior to your internal state: "I'm glad I don't have to engage in that right now. I can be okay."
*   The goal is a **"cool"** and light mind, free from carrying the burdens of past and future.

### **Conclusion**
The entire teaching is distilled into a simple, moment-to-moment practice: **Remember to look at your mind. See unwholesome thoughts (dissatisfaction). Actively change them to wholesome thoughts (satisfaction, safety, "all is well"). Congratulate yourself.** This repeated cycle cultivates the First Jhana—a state of sustained joy and satisfaction that is itself the path to the end of suffering.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate the core teachings and common pitfalls in practice. Here is a breakdown:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **"Bolt-ons" vs. "Basic Transportation":** The core practice (changing dissatisfaction to satisfaction) is the reliable "basic transportation" that gets you where you need to go. Other doctrines (cosmology, complex rituals) are unnecessary "bolt-ons."
2.  **"Putting the weights down":** Letting go of unwholesome thoughts and dissatisfaction is like putting down heavy weights; you "immediately feel light" without needing to "gain" anything.
3.  **The "Map" or "Pathway":** The Anapanasati Sutta is described as a "map or a pathway into the first jhana," providing a guided route for the practice of change.
4.  **"Fixing" as the Problem:** The lifelong habit of looking for what's wrong to fix it is itself the problem. The solution is to see that "trying to fix it is the problem" and drop that approach.
5.  **"Sitting with the thought":** The common mindfulness instruction to observe thoughts without judgment is framed as "just sitting with more unwholesomeness" or "repeating the unwholesome thought over and over again."
6.  **"Carrying heavy things":** Remorse and past burdens are like heavy items we carry around. The practice involves seeing we are carrying them and choosing to put them down.
7.  **"Life is shallow":** Contrary to the desire for "deep" meaning or "deep" meditation, life is just this present moment—it's "shallow." Adding deep meaning is a choice of thought.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **The Origin of Religions as "Scams":** The speaker tells a story of how religions historically started from human dissatisfaction. When they failed to solve it, they evolved into capitalizing on that suffering with rituals and products, becoming characterized by the message: "you cannot come out of your dissatisfaction... not alone. You need a savior, a guru."
2.  **The Thirsty Person:** A simple story to illustrate the Second Noble Truth (the cause of *dukkha*). If you're thirsty and water is present, you drink and it's over. If you're thirsty and there's no water, the *craving* for what you don't have is the source of dissatisfaction.
3.  **The Young Piano Student:** This story tackles the hindrance of **doubt**. A child who refuses to play the piano because they can't immediately play Chopin is like someone who won't start the simple practice because they feel they can't "get it right" or do it perfectly from the beginning. The point is to "start with chopsticks"—start simply and correctly now.
4.  **The Monk and the Famous Teacher (Cat's story):** An anecdote about a newly ordained monk (Cat) and a "famous English meditation teacher." The teacher postponed working on her defilements, saying she would address them on a future retreat. The moral is that the right time to change an unwholesome state is **the very moment it arises** ("on that phone call"), not by postponing it for a "deep practice."
5.  **Standing in Line:** A relatable scenario of people in queues being miserable not because of the present act of standing, but because of what they have to do next. This illustrates how we create dissatisfaction by leaving the present moment. The practice is to think, "Right now I'm standing and everything is all right."
6.  **Sigmund Freud's "Free Association":** Referenced as a counter-example to the Buddha's teaching. Letting the mind spin and narrate thoughts (as in Freudian therapy) is used to highlight the Buddha's opposing method: see an unwholesome thought and change it immediately, not dwell on or repeat it.

### **Key Symbolic Contrasts**
*   **Dukkha (Dissatisfaction) vs. Sukha (Satisfaction):** The entire talk is framed around this core duality and the practice of transforming one into the other.
*   **Outside vs. Inside:** Society teaches us to seek satisfaction from the outside (new car, job, house). The practice is a "major change" of turning inward to find it.
*   **Deep Practice vs. Light Practice:** The sought-after "deep" meditation retreat is contrasted with the "light," immediate, and "enlightening" practice of the first jhana in daily life.
*   **Psychology vs. Buddha's Teaching:** Western psychological ideas of "sitting with" or "observing" thoughts are explicitly contrasted with the Buddha's active "change model."

These metaphors and stories consistently serve to **demystify the practice**, frame it as an **active, immediate skill of thought-management**, and **critique common misinterpretations or commercializations** of Buddhist meditation.
