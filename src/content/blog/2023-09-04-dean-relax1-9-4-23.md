### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Yes, if it's relaxing. I just turned the video on. Okay. That's the whole point about it, is to relax. You're asking, well, what do I do in detail? And the overall point is to relax. And so yes, it's actually relaxing to, after you've taken an out-breath, to let it linger. And then you take the in-breath, because an in-breath is not quite as relaxing as an out-breath.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I've lost your picture, Dhammarato. All I have is a picture, the picture of you.

**Speaker A:** Okay, you're back. All right, so that's the issue, is to relax the body. So, the other thing which is equally important, you can't relax the body if you can't remember. And so, working with the in-breath and the out-breath in a mindful way, or to remember that you're doing it, that's the important thing. And whatever you're counting, It's just a kind of an example to give people the idea of actually how to breathe.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, where I actually got it from, Scott said it, but I also sometimes listen to one or two, one or two of your guided meditations.

**Speaker A:** Yes, and I will tell that to students, but you're asking a more in-depth question, and so I'm giving you a general answer. I ain't— that the in-depth is not exactly whether it's by the second or how you're counting or whatever like that. The important point overall is that you're mindfully breathing, you're actually watching what you're doing, paying attention to the body as it breathes in order for you to relax the body as it breathes. But the relaxation is the important part of the the body function in the Satipatthana, the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, and the number one item is the body. Why? Because the body is real. Most of what happens in the mind is, let us say, playing with reality, making up concepts, living in a somewhat non-real world, and then the emotions are generally not real. And so the important thing then is to recognize that the body is actually real, in a real place, with real senses, real dangers. And so we need to get the body out of the dangerous situation, we need to get the body comfortable, and then get the body relaxed. That's the whole practice. So it doesn't matter how you're counting, whether you're counting box breathing— and by the way, box breathing doesn't really get the body relaxed. It's to keep the body up and alert, ready for battle.

**Speaker B:** What I do is I get the mind still with the counting, Dhammarato, and then when the mind is still, that's when I start injecting the positive talk, the positive self-talk.

**Speaker A:** Okay, all right, I'm not against that at all.

**Speaker B:** Okay. I'm just going to turn on the telly for the young lad. But go on, I'm listening.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, what you're doing is correct. Mindfully breathing in, mindfully breathing out. And you're saying that in fact that you can get the mind more still so that when that, then the positive thoughts really have great benefit for you. So it sounds like to me like you're practicing correctly. So congratulations.

**Speaker B:** I have two kids now just starting to wake up.

**Speaker A:** I know, I saw one of them flash on the screen.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but, uh, yeah, um, I, I, my practice, my practice is going pretty well now the last week or two, and I can feel the Sukkha. But it's very subtle, but I can feel it.

**Speaker A:** And I can feel like— The light behind you now is disturbing, so that if you can come out of the light, it's still a little bit on the left. Can you move a little bit more? There you go. That's good.

**Speaker B:** So you said to me, it sounds like my practice is going well, which it is, and I can feel a bit of Sukkha. I can feel my feelings. I can feel that I'm generating positive feelings. Now it's subtle, but it's going in the right direction.

**Speaker A:** Good, very good. So you can congratulate yourself for feeling good, knowing that you can feel good, and that'll help you feel even better.

**Speaker B:** It does, and you know what, I've been doing that as well. Yes, 100%. One thing I did want to say, Dhammarato, is I felt after 4 or 5 days of— well, maybe 3 or 4 days of feeling good and going in the right direction, one day then I didn't feel as good. Was that the start of a new cycle?

**Speaker A:** Well, yes, but it doesn't have to be a long cycle. Then in fact, the whole point is, is that when you find yourself going into a down state, then you can say, aha, I see that. And so now let's practice a little more, making ourselves getting back into a good state. That if you experience those negative feelings in the sense of some anxiety in the chest or heaviness in the stomach, that's when we go back to the basics of the body and breathe into it. Breathe into the tightness of the body, so that we can relax it. And then that cycle is not going to last more than 5 minutes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and that's one question I had for you, Dhammarato. How long do cycles generally last? Do you know?

**Speaker A:** For people who are not paying attention, their whole lives.

**Speaker B:** But that's what I'm saying. How long does one cycle last?

**Speaker A:** Do you know? The answer to that is until you change it.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that the cycles go around and mostly what people have to do is that they're not happy on the part of the cycle they're on. And when you go into a part of the cycle that you don't like, then it's up to you to make a change. That change can take 20 minutes or it can take 5 minutes. It's up to you and your mindfulness and your right noble effort. Okay, so there's no particular wall clock time for how long those cycles are going to last. But the unhappy or the downside of the cycle is going to last as long as you're not paying attention. So when you start paying attention to it again, you can bring yourself back out of it.

**Speaker B:** In one of the early videos you have with Alex, it is called Making Patterns in the Mind. Is that in regard to the cycles, or is that— Yes.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it is that you can make those patterns. And in fact, you did make that pattern anyway. Become aware of the patterns that you're making, then you can change them. You can watch it, you can remember, just look at it, then you watch it, and then you can change it. And so those cycles then are up to you. They're not a wall clock kind of timing. All cycles last 20 minutes. Oh, cycles last 20 hours. No. No, that's not how they are.

**Speaker B:** If I was to say, I'd say they lasted a couple of days for myself, nearly. Yeah, but I don't know for sure.

**Speaker A:** Wakey wakey, start practicing that. In fact, there can be a time when you're down, like let us say 2 days, but in that 2-day time, the first hour of it, you can say, hey, I see that And so you can actually add more to your, um, to it. And then that cycle may not last 2 days, it may only last a day and a half. It depends upon how many times you keep coming back out of that cycle.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And pretty soon that downer cycle will be over.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I understand.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so, okay, they don't last a couple of days, they lasted— they last until you figure out that you can make a change. Then you change the cycle. It really is that easy.

**Speaker B:** Okay, and you know what, and I have— look, I'm on medication at the moment, Dhammarato, and the mechanisms of the medication, it affects dopamine. So I'm getting small— why, I had one when I've seen the Sukkha, I had one or two little small subtle, I'd say they were dopamine hits, but they weren't like the big ones I had before. And I'm hoping it's because of the medication that that's why it's affecting that.

**Speaker A:** But again, would you say— That's a very good thing. Let's stop for just a second and recognize that when people take medicines because they're prescribed by a doctor, they take them without monitoring the body to make sure that they can tell the difference between the medication or no medication. All right, that's the whole point, is, is that if the medication is not doing you any good, only you will know that. And if the medication is doing you good, really the only one who will know is you. The only reason the doctor, uh, will know is because you tell him.

**Speaker B:** Well, look, it's something that I have— I'm underway down on tapering, but it's something that I need for the time being. However, I'm still getting ready for when I'm fully off. Like the joy, when joy comes and it's a beautiful feeling, it's a great kick.

**Speaker A:** When that comes— when you talk yourself into it, the joy doesn't come by itself, nor is it put in the door by some event. The joy comes because you decide for the joy to come.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I agree, but there is kind of some factors that you have to put in play, like being in the present moment and starting to try enjoy the present moment.

**Speaker A:** And then, yes, that's the whole point, is that if you can get yourself into the present moment and watch what you're doing and let that joy come, the relaxation the comfort, the lack of fear because you're feeling safe and secure, that feeling of satisfaction. And when that comes, then the joy. Wow, this is really great that I'm satisfied. This is really nice that everything is working out right now.

**Speaker B:** And you know where my biggest source of joy has been? Listening to stories about Buddha Dassa. Okay, that was amazing.

**Speaker A:** He's a— he's listening to your joyful stories. That's the whole point, is, is that, yeah, you're gaining the joy kind of secondhand, just like so many students gain great joy just by calling and talking to me.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I, I feel— I've seen it before. You've nearly put me into Jhana before by just being on the call with you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, sure. So why has it been so long since you've called?

**Speaker B:** I've had a lot going on. I've had a lot going on.

**Speaker A:** That's a really good reason to call, not a good reason to not call.

**Speaker B:** True.

**Speaker A:** Then in fact, you don't need to have a lot going on. Just one day at a time is comfortable. When we got a lot going on, then we get busy, we get anxious, we get in a hurry. And so Coming out of that is a good idea. So that's when you're really busy, that's a good time to stop and read some Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. When you're really, really busy, that's a good time to stop and to give me a call.

**Speaker B:** At the moment, I don't really have much appetite for anything else other than the Dhamma. No, I listen, I like listening to a bit of music, but I'm finding it hard to even watch something on TV as a movie or a program. It's all It's just meditating, it seems, all I want to do. And I don't mind helping out around the house either, like I have no problem, I am giving a hand.

**Speaker A:** Well, that could be your practice also. Thus one trains oneself to be happy in the day's activities.

**Speaker B:** But sometimes I find it harder. When I'm walking, that's no problem, I try to put in I try to be present and put in the positive self-talk. But when I'm washing dishes, I find that a lot harder.

**Speaker A:** Ah, but instead of washing the dishes, wash this dish, this dish, and make this a joyful washing of this dish. Never mind all of the others. If I can wash this dish joyfully, get it clean, put it down, then I can wash the next dish. Joyfully.

**Speaker B:** Well, you know what, to tell you the truth, we actually have a dishwasher, but it's what I'm trying to say, it's the little smaller jobs like that. That's just an example I give you, but probably— I know.

**Speaker A:** Well, whatever it is, whether it's washing the dishes, sweeping the floor, making the bed, cleaning up the mess the children made, whatever it is, one moment at a time, enjoy what you're doing. Remember to take those deep breaths. Anapanasati in action would be the way that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa would mention it. That while you're acting, while you're doing stuff, you can still be mindful of your breathing, mindful of what your mind is doing, mindful of how you feel, so that you can change how you feel. You can have a great deal of joy with every dish. Having a little bit of disappointment when the dishes are all finished. Now I can't have fun with the— with washing dishes, so I'll go have fun cleaning the floor.

**Speaker B:** Okay, just before I go, because the daughter is starting to wake up now as well. Dhammarato, if I'm planning, I'm either going to go into— I'm either going to go to a Wat in Europe, or I might— are going to come to Thailand for my stag party. Well, this won't be a party, but I'd be on my own. What are the processes involved with coming to Thailand? Is it hard?

**Speaker A:** Actually, the visas are getting easier. I would think that where you are is that you just get on the plane and come to Thailand and deal with the visa with the immigration office when you come in the airport. Okay, do you need any— you don't need it, you don't need a visa in advance for getting a tourist visa. And that tourist visa will be good for 2 months. Are you intending to stay longer than 2 months?

**Speaker B:** I'll just try. It's kind of a— for my stag, because I'm getting married in March.

**Speaker A:** So you're going to abandon your girlfriend and come to Thailand for a couple of months?

**Speaker B:** No, no, no, for a week, a week, a week or two. How, 10 days maybe? I've tried to do it Retreat somewhere.

**Speaker A:** So this is what you do: go to the website for Deepa Bhavana and check the retreat schedule so that you can get here in Thailand a day or two before the retreat starts. Be sure that you sign up for the retreat so you'll have a place there, and then book your ticket for a couple of days after the retreat's finished. Okay, okay. The retreats at Deepa Bhavana normally last for about 7 days. And so you can do this within 2 weeks, right?

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right, a few days before and a few days after and 7 days in the retreat, and that'll keep you 2 weeks.

**Speaker B:** Tell me this, do I need any injections or anything before I head?

**Speaker A:** No.

**Speaker B:** No. Well, look, I have very big on.

**Speaker A:** COVID, but now no longer.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, just— I won't be taking no fucking COVID vaccine anyway. But anyway, that's near or there. But, um, yeah, I'm either going to go into Europe or I'm going to come to see you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** All right, I would love it if you could come. I have a place on the porch for you to stay.

**Speaker B:** Okay, that's no bother. Well, look, I'll be in touch in the meantime. I won't be till maybe— All right, thanks very much. Yes, thank you.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, we'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** Okay, thank you.

**Speaker A:** Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk transcript, here is a summary of the key teachings and discussion points between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and a Sangha friend (Speaker B):

### **Core Teaching: The Primacy of Relaxation and Mindfulness of the Body**
*   **The Main Goal is Relaxation:** The fundamental practice is to relax the body using the breath. The out-breath is particularly relaxing. The technique (like counting) is secondary; the primary aim is mindful breathing to induce relaxation.
*   **Body as the Foundation:** The body is emphasized as the first foundation of mindfulness because it is "real." In contrast, much of our mental activity involves concepts and emotions that are removed from direct reality. The path is to make the body comfortable and relaxed as a base for practice.
*   **Breath as the Tool:** Mindful breathing (Anapanasati) is the method to both remember to be present and to relax the body. Techniques like "box breathing" are noted as being for alertness, not for the deep relaxation sought in this practice.

### **Practical Application and Challenges**
*   **Working with Cycles:** The discussion covers the natural cycles of feeling good (*Sukkha*) and then feeling down. The key insight is that a "down cycle" lasts **only as long as you are not paying attention**. With mindfulness, you can recognize a negative state and use the breath to relax the body and change the cycle, potentially within minutes.
*   **Joy is Actively Cultivated:** Joy and positive feelings don't just happen; they are generated through deliberate practice. This includes positive self-talk and consciously choosing to find satisfaction and safety in the present moment.
*   **Practice in Daily Life:** The practice extends beyond formal meditation. One should bring mindful joy to daily activities like washing dishes—focusing joyfully on one task at a time, with mindful breathing ("Anapanasati in action").

### **Personal Practice & Guidance**
*   **Speaker B's Practice:** He finds that counting helps still his mind, after which he injects positive self-talk. He reports feeling subtle *Sukkha* (happiness/bliss) and is observing his mental cycles. He also finds inspiration and joy in listening to talks about Ajahn Buddhadasa.
*   **Dhammarato's Feedback:** Dhammarato affirms that Speaker B's practice is correct and encourages him to congratulate himself for progress, which reinforces positive feelings.
*   **On Medication:** A brief discussion acknowledges that medication can be part of one's current path. The importance of self-monitoring to understand its effects is highlighted, with the ultimate goal of cultivating inner well-being independent of external aids.

### **Logistical Conclusion**
The talk ends with practical planning, as Speaker B inquires about visiting Thailand for a retreat. Dhammarato provides simple advice on visas and suggests planning around a 7-day retreat at **Deepa Bhavana**, offering him a place to stay.

**In essence,** the talk reinforces a practical, body-based approach to Dhamma practice where mindful breathing for relaxation is the cornerstone for managing mental states, cultivating joy in the present, and integrating mindfulness into all aspects of daily life.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the provided transcript, the primary metaphors and stories used in this talk are:

### 1. **The Cycle Metaphor**
This is the central metaphor of the discussion. Speaker A describes emotional and mental states as **cycles** that one moves through.
*   **Key Quote:** "For people who are not paying attention, their whole lives." (referring to how long a negative cycle can last).
*   **Meaning:** It illustrates that low or high moods are not permanent states but phases that come and go. The practitioner's task is to recognize ("wakey wakey") which part of the cycle they are in and use mindfulness to shorten the negative phases and prolong the positive ones.

### 2. **The "Wall Clock" vs. "Inner Clock" Contrast**
This is a sub-metaphor within the cycle discussion.
*   **Key Quote:** "There's no particular wall clock time for how long those cycles are going to last."
*   **Meaning:** It contrasts objective, external time ("wall clock") with subjective, psychological time. The duration of a mental cycle isn't fixed by hours or days; it's determined by one's awareness and effort. This emphasizes that change is internally controlled, not on a pre-set schedule.

### 3. **The "Patterns in the Mind" Metaphor**
This metaphor is referenced from a previous talk.
*   **Key Quote:** "In one of the early videos you have with Alex, it is called Making Patterns in the Mind. Is that in regard to the cycles?"
*   **Meaning:** It suggests that habitual emotional and thought pathways are like grooves or patterns in the mind. Once you become aware of these patterns (like a recurring negative cycle), you can observe them and consciously re-route them to create new, healthier patterns.

### 4. **The "Box Breathing for Battle" Story/Analogy**
Speaker A uses a specific breathing technique as a story to illustrate a broader point about intention.
*   **Key Quote:** "Box breathing doesn't really get the body relaxed. It's to keep the body up and alert, ready for battle."
*   **Meaning:** This brief analogy contrasts different goals of meditation. It suggests that techniques have different purposes—some (like box breathing) are for alertness and readiness (like a soldier), while the practice being discussed is specifically for relaxation and calming. The story underscores that the *intention* behind the technique is crucial.

### 5. **The "Washing Dishes Joyfully" Story**
This is a practical, anecdotal story offered as a teaching example.
*   **Key Quote:** "If I can wash this dish joyfully, get it clean, put it down, then I can wash the next dish. Joyfully."
*   **Meaning:** It embodies the principle of bringing mindfulness and positive intention into daily activities ("Anapanasati in action"). The story teaches breaking down a potentially tedious task into singular, present-moment actions that can each be a source of satisfaction and joy, transforming chore into practice.

### 6. **The "Real vs. Non-Real World" Metaphor**
This is used to explain the foundational importance of focusing on the body.
*   **Key Quote:** "Because the body is real. Most of what happens in the mind is... living in a somewhat non-real world, and then the emotions are generally not real."
*   **Meaning:** It creates a dichotomy between the tangible, present-moment reality of the physical body and the conceptual, often fabricated world of thoughts and emotions. This metaphor justifies why mindfulness practice starts with the body—it's a stable, "real" anchor to return to from the turbulent "non-real" world of the mind.

**Summary:** The talk uses the overarching metaphor of **cycles and patterns** to explain mental states. It supports this with practical analogies (**box breathing for battle, washing dishes**) and conceptual contrasts (**wall clock vs. inner clock, real vs. non-real**) to make the teachings on mindfulness, intention, and present-moment awareness tangible and applicable.
