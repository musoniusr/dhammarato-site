### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** Hello, YouTube, and welcome to the Wednesday weekly UK Sangha. Today we have Parker, Alex, and Vedana here with us, and I'm going to continue with the trend of last week. We're going to read a sutta and just kind of take it point by point, paragraph by paragraph, and we can discuss any insights or ideas that come up, or just run through the whole thing and talk about it at the end. So this is an open dialogue. The one that I picked out is Mahayana Anicca 4, Fear and Dread. So this is a pretty juicy one in my opinion. It has some magical stuff in there. So a lot of things that people base past life stuff practices and also rebirth is in this, but it also has like the heart of the Dharma in it as well. So it has some good Buddhist lore, if you will, to add to the to add to the mystery and.

**Speaker A:** Enchanting.

**Speaker B:** Aspects of the Dharma, which I think can be very cool. And there are people who do have these kinds of experiences. Me personally, I've never had a past life experience, but it actually is very common in people on the path.

**Speaker A:** So to speak.

**Speaker B:** So let's just hop right into it.

**Speaker A:** Thus have I heard on one occasion the Blessed One was living in Savathi in Jetta's Grove, Anapanasati Park.

**Speaker B:** Then the Brahmin— and okay, another disclaimer, I'm just going to butcher the names, but I'm just going to keep rolling with it.

**Speaker A:** Then the Brahmin Janusoni went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one side and said, Master Gautama, when clansmen have gone forth from the home life into homelessness out of faith in Master Gautama, do they have Master Gautama for their leader, their helper, and their guide? And do these people follow the example of Master Gautama? That is so, Brahman, that is so. When clansmen have gone forth from home life into homelessness out of faith in me, they have me for their leader, their helper, and their guide, and these people follow my example. But Master Gotama, remote jungle thicket resting places in the forest are hard to endure. Seclusion is hard to practice. And it is hard to enjoy solitude. One would think the jungles must rob a Bhikkhu of his mind if he has no concentration. That is so, Brahmin, that is so. Remote jungle thicket resting places in the forest are hard to endure. Seclusion is hard to practice, and it is hard to enjoy solitude. One would think the jungles must rob a Bhikkhu of his mind if he has no concentration.

**Speaker B:** So right off the bat, it's acknowledging that this isn't a walk in the park. So it is actually hard to enjoy solitude. So this is really a kind of noble practice, if you will. Another way to think about it is a hero's journey. So we all heard of the archetype of the hero journey. So there is an aspect of going into solitude and going into seclusion from it all and conquering the darkness, so to speak. And then also, okay, I'll keep going.

**Speaker A:** And then Talk about it later. Before my enlightenment, while I was still only an unenlightened Bodhisattva, I too considered thus: remote jungle thicket resting places in the forest are hard to endure. The jungles must rob a Bhikkhu of his mind if he has no concentration. I considered thus: whenever recluses or Brahmins, unpurified in bodily conduct resort to remote jungle thicket resting places in the forest. Then, owing to the defect of their unpurified bodily conduct, these good recluses and brahmins evoke unwholesome fear and dread. But I do not resort to remote jungle resting places in the forest unpurified in bodily conduct. I am purified in bodily conduct. I resort to remote jungle thicket resting places in the forest as one of the nobles with bodily conduct purified. Seeing in myself this purity of bodily conduct, I found great solace in dwelling in the forest. All right, so here it's talking about purification of bodily conduct.

**Speaker B:** So.

**Speaker A:** This has to do with the.

**Speaker B:** Habits and the maintenance of the body leading up to these kinds of meditative practices and sort of the inner state of what's going on inside yourself. So the set and setting, if you will, of your mind when you go into the remote jungle thicket. And if it's not purified, likely unwholesome fear and dread will be aroused. I would say for anyone who's interested in experimenting with psychedelics, it's the same thing. So there's a kind of purification that is necessary to have to avoid certain.

**Speaker A:** Unwholesome.

**Speaker B:** Downward spirals, if you will.

**Speaker C:** In fact, it's used as a punishment for people with unpurified bodily conduct, speech, and mind. That has a reputation of being a pretty extreme punishment of putting them in seclusion and not letting them talk to anybody. And they'll go crazy, crazy with hindrances, crazy with dissatisfaction.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** Just the only slight difference would be that for solitary confinement, they're in a very enclosed space with pretty plain walls, whereas the remote jungle thicket is— That's a good point.

**Speaker A:** It's in the thick of nature.

**Speaker B:** So there's all sorts of reptiles and scary animals that could come into play.

**Speaker A:** And more sensory input that's available there.

**Speaker B:** So it is slightly different, but the seclusion from people is the same and the psychological aspect that comes with that. So.

**Speaker A:** Let'S keep going.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so the Buddha says he resorts to a remote jungle thicket with a purified body.

**Speaker A:** I resort to remote jungle thicket resting places in the forest, as noble ones do. Okay, here we are. I consider thus, whenever recluses or brahmins, unpurified in verbal conduct, unpurified in mental conduct, unpurified in livelihood, resort to remote jungle thicket resting places in the forest. They evoke unwholesome fear and dread. But I am purified in my livelihood. I resort to remote jungle thicket resting places in the forest as one of the nobles with livelihood purified. Seeing in myself this purity of livelihood, I found great solace in dwelling in the forest. I consider thus: whenever recluses or brahmins who are covetous and full of lust, I am uncovetous. With a mind of ill will and intentions of hate, I have a mind of loving kindness. Overcome by sloth and torpor, I am without sloth and torpor. Overcome with restless and unpeaceful mind, I have a peaceful mind. Uncertain and doubting, I have gone beyond doubt. Given to self-praise and disparagement of others, I am not given to self-praise and disparagement of others. Subject to alarm and terror, I am free from trepidation. Desirous of gain, honor, and renown, I have few wishes. Lazy and wanting in energy, I am energetic. Unmindful and not fully aware, I'm established in mindfulness. Unconcentrated with straying minds, I am possessed of concentration.

**Speaker B:** So this is talking about all the hindrances and the possibility.

**Speaker A:** For unwholesome states to arise.

**Speaker B:** So it's really about the Eightfold Noble Path of right everything. So you go with the right attitude, the right view, the right behavior, the right everything, and things are going to go good. But it is a training. So you go again, you go as a Noble One. So you go with that attitude of being a noble, of being of being established in mindfulness, of being fully aware. So it's a mindset. I can do this mindset. If you're going and you're just sandbagging it and you got sloth and torpor.

**Speaker A:** And.

**Speaker B:** You'Re disparaging others in your mind and you're being hateful, all these hindrances that If you haven't purified it, if you haven't made that effort to throw out those hindrances, you're going to experience.

**Speaker A:** A lot of unwholesome fear and dread.

**Speaker B:** In solitude or seclusion.

**Speaker A:** Okay. I consider thus whenever recluses or Brahmins devoid of wisdom drivelers resort to remote jungle thicket resting places in the forest. Then, owing to the defect of their being devoid of wisdom and drivelers, these good recluses and brahmins evoke unwholesome fear and dread. I do not resort to remote jungle thicket resting places in the forest devoid of wisdom, a driveler. I am possessed of wisdom. I resort to remote jungle thicket resting places in the forest as one of the noble ones possessed of wisdom. Seeing in myself this possession of wisdom, I found great solace in dwelling in the forest. I considered thus: there are specially auspicious nights of the 14th, the 15th, and the 8th of the fortnight. Now what if on such nights as these I were to dwell in such awe-inspiring, horrifying abodes as orchard shrines, woodland shrines, and tree shrines. Perhaps I might encounter that fear and dread.

**Speaker B:** So even with purified mind and with the right attitude and everything, fear and.

**Speaker A:** Dread may still arise.

**Speaker B:** And the Buddha will talk about how he handled that and what to do with that.

**Speaker A:** And later, on such specially auspicious nights as the the 14th, the 15th, and the 8th of the fortnight. I dwelt in such awe-inspiring, horrifying abodes as orchid shrines, woodland shrines, and tree shrines. And while I dwelt there, a wild animal would come up to me, or a peacock would knock off a branch, or the wind would rustle the leaves. I thought, what now? If this is the fear and dread coming, I thought, why do I dwell always expecting fear and dread? What if I subdue that fear and dread while keeping the same posture that I am in when it comes upon me? So here's kind of a practice that.

**Speaker B:** We can take from this. So this is the main point.

**Speaker A:** Are the most important part of the.

**Speaker B:** Sutta, in my opinion, that actually how to apply it and recreate the results for yourself.

**Speaker A:** So it says, while I walked, the fear and dread came upon me. I neither stood nor sat nor lay down till I had subdued that fear and dread. While I stood, the fear and dread came upon me. I neither walked nor sat nor lay down till I had subdued that fear and dread. While I sat, the fear and dread came upon me. I neither walked nor stood nor lay down till I had subdued that fear and dread. While I lay down, the fear and dread came upon me. I neither walked nor stood nor sat down till I had subdued that fear and dread. There are Brahmins, some recluses and Brahmins, who perceive day when it is night. And night when it is day. I say that on their part this is Anapanasati and delusion. But I perceive night when it is night and day when it is day. Rightly speaking, were it to be said of anyone, a being not subject to delusion has appeared in the world for the welfare and happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the good welfare and happiness of gods and humans. It is of me indeed that rightly speaking this should be said. Tireless energy was aroused in me and unremitting mindfulness was established. My body was tranquil and untroubled, my mind concentrated and purified. Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, I entered upon and abided in the first Jhana. Which is accompanied by applied and sustained thoughts, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion.

**Speaker B:** All right, so there it's really talking about what this practice is leading to and what the actual fruition is. So if you are able to surmount your own fear and dread, so whenever this fear and dread arises, you become absolutely determined to suppress it. So you're sitting down, you experience some fear arise. I'm not— I'm literally not going to do anything until I conquer the fear that's inside of me and subdue it. Or if you're walking and the fear arises, you're not going to do anything else until you subdue it. Or you're laying down, and so on. So there's no distracting yourself from it, there's no running from it. There's no trying to cope with it. Chances are all these coping mechanisms are.

**Speaker A:** Just going to prolong or.

**Speaker B:** Keep the unwholesome.

**Speaker A:** Habits going.

**Speaker B:** So many people's coping mechanisms for this fear and dread may be to hit the bottle. You know, start to— and there is the consequences that come along with that when you make that a habit of coping with this fear and dread that arises instead of facing it directly and surmounting it.

**Speaker A:** And when you do, what's going to.

**Speaker B:** Happen is you're going to enter into first Jhana. So you're going to come into a wholesome state, and tireless energy will arouse in you. So it's kind of like crossing a threshold kind of thing. So you cross the threshold, and you cross the desert, and you make it to the oasis. And you get to the oasis, and now all of a sudden, all this.

**Speaker A:** Energy, all this relief, all this clarity.

**Speaker B:** Suffuses your mind and your experience. And it's quite enjoyable and quite victorious when it happens. So also another thing that's pretty badass about this is.

**Speaker A:** The part where it says, for the welfare and happiness of many, for gods and humans.

**Speaker B:** So there are gods out there who can benefit from the Dhamma rather than praying to the sky daddy up there, please help me. You can actually help those guys who are up in the heaven who are ruling over this plane of Samsara or whatever. You want to think of it as whatever realm we're in right now. So this is for the good of gods, humans, any being. So you're not— so you kind of don't put yourself under the thumb of a god. You don't take yourself to be a loser, which most Christianity does. Oh, woe is me, I'm not worthy, right? Okay, so he talks about first Jhana.

**Speaker A:** And then here it's going to all.

**Speaker B:** The aspects of the first Jhana. So we have the applied and sustained.

**Speaker A:** Thoughts and rapture and pleasure born of seclusion.

**Speaker B:** So rapture is Piti, right? Piti can be experienced in different sorts of levels and facets, but the characterizing aspects of piti is that it's very energizing, it's uplifted, it's enlivening, invigorating. It could be sensations, it could be different types of sensations, so it doesn't have to be like one type of buzzing or something like that that a lot of people think of it as. So just to think of it more as joy, you know, it doesn't have to be a specific sensation that arises.

**Speaker A:** But joyful sensations and pleasure.

**Speaker B:** Pleasure is a more tranquil, more relaxed Sukkha. So comfort of body and peacefulness of body. And applied and sustained thought.

**Speaker A:** So.

**Speaker B:** I want to ask you guys, what does applied and sustained thought mean to you? What does that mean? Anyone want to.

**Speaker A:** Answer?

**Speaker C:** I think there are often two renditions of it. The one that is likely this sutta is referring to is.

**Speaker B:** One way of.

**Speaker C:** It being translated is thinking and considering. So thinking is when a thought arises, and considering is when you're continuing to think about that thought. I think the insight crowd sometimes talks about it as taking an object, you're applying the mind to the object, and then the sustained thought is sustaining on the object. But it seems more likely and more accurate to talk about it as thinking and considering.

**Speaker A:** Right, right.

**Speaker B:** So the thinking and examining thought. Yeah, the thinking and examining thought. It's a very important characteristic of the first Jhana. It's essentially the thoughts going, oh, this is Piti. Oh, this is Sukkha. This is first Jhana. What's going on right now? I'm feeling good, thought. So you're thinking about how good you're feeling and you're examining it. You're looking at it. Wow, this is cool. This is Piti and Sukkha. This is Jhana. This is wholesome is another example. That thought, applying and sustaining that thought and not going off into.

**Speaker A:** Projections or wholesome thoughts.

**Speaker C:** Thoughts of the Brahma Viharas. Yeah, thoughts of there are no problems right now, everything's okay, the grass grows by itself.

**Speaker B:** Any wholesome thoughts, but not just talking ourselves into it at that point because you're already in it. So at this point, instead of talking yourself into it, you're examining the wholesome that's already there. So you're thinking and examining wholesome thoughts but you're not, you're not like, uh, you're not trying to get yourself into it. You're already in it. So you're looking at, oh, there's all.

**Speaker A:** This wholesome stuff going on right now.

**Speaker B:** How cool, let me stay on it and sustain that.

**Speaker D:** Collecting evidence.

**Speaker B:** That's the difference. Yeah, collect, collecting evidence.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that's a good example.

**Speaker B:** Um, but to get to there, a practice, um, there's many different ways. One is talking yourself into it, thinking wholesome thoughts until you are in a wholesome state. And now you're just watching the wholesome thoughts and being like, oh, look, look at the Piti, look at the Sukkha. This is nice. This is actually really nice and relaxing. And keeping that going. So it's a practice, right?

**Speaker A:** It's a sustaining, applying and sustaining over and over and over and over again.

**Speaker B:** And then going on to the second jhana.

**Speaker A:** With the stilling of applied and sustained thoughts, I entered upon and abided in the second jhana, which has self-confidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thoughts, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion.

**Speaker B:** So this is the transition from first jhana into second jhana. This is when you got it and you really know you got it. So you don't have to really think about it anymore. You can just appreciate, soak it in, really soak it in how good it is, how good you're feeling. And you don't have to think about it. You can just enjoy it.

**Speaker A:** So that's the stilling of the thoughts.

**Speaker B:** I don't need to— I know this is Piti. I know this is Sukkha. I can just stop thinking about it and experience it. And then so we start to put some gaps in between the thoughts. We just start to feel good. And there's a real confidence that comes along with it because it speaks for itself. It's kind of like the proof is in the pudding. So the proof of the pudding is the taste.

**Speaker A:** So you're tasting the rapture and the pleasure.

**Speaker B:** Without thinking about it. So you might be eating something and thinking about how it tastes, or you might just be eating it and like, it's kind of like Tantric. So people have different kinds of Tantric practices. Second Jhana is very Tantric. You just go into the experience of it without thinking about it.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker D:** Hey, Scott.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** You can jump into the second Jhana from without going into the first.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. In your experience?

**Speaker B:** I would say no, because chances are, as a practice, if that does happen to you, chances are you're going to get pooped right out of it because it's not intentional and you're not doing it as a practice and you're not applying applying and sustaining it. So yeah, you might experience second jhana. You're listening to a beautiful symphony and, uh, your mind goes blank and the goosebumps sort of enrapture your body and you're just, wow, this is incredible. And you, you're— you stop thinking about it and you experience it for that, for that moment. That would be second jhana, but there's no, there's no intention there, there's no practice. Whereas this is actual intentional thing that we're doing to experience this on purpose. And it's a skill and a subtlety of mind that you can develop. But yeah, actually realizing when we have experienced second Jhana is very useful for understanding how to implement it. So yes, you can jump into second Jhana. It's a natural part of being human. It happens, you know.

**Speaker D:** I think you can do it intentionally too. Only reason why I say that is because I noticed sometimes I could just, I don't know, I could just smile and be like, oh man, just feel really good. Almost like it's just, you're like priming something.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so if you're able to do that, you'd have to already kind of be in a wholesome state of mind to even do that or think or want to do that. So that would be first Jhana.

**Speaker A:** And okay, so continue.

**Speaker B:** Um, so yeah, to enter into second Jhana, you have to already be in a pretty decent mood, right? Yeah, you're not gonna go from— you're not gonna go from thinking about your ex-girlfriend to experiencing ecstasy for no reason. You have to be in a relatively wholesome state.

**Speaker A:** To go into this.

**Speaker B:** So it is— well, I don't know.

**Speaker D:** I don't know. I mean, you know, I don't want to say— I'm definitely not going to say you're wrong, but to challenge what.

**Speaker B:** You just said— I could be wrong. It's, you know, the practice of Jhana is experiential, so see for yourself and see what happens. That's what I'd say.

**Speaker D:** I've had several moments where I'm thinking about my ex-girlfriend, and I've shifted the practice from letting those thoughts go any— like, as soon as I see it, I just smile. I just smile and feel really good.

**Speaker C:** That's a good point to be made, that as one develops these skills, originally the effort is into thinking wholesome thoughts. And thinking wholesome thoughts, because the mind is so stuck in the unwholesome, it doesn't have any memories of being in a wholesome state. But as one really develops a skill of thinking wholesome thoughts and thinking thoughts that are satisfying, they'll start to develop a sort of memory of being in a satisfied, wholesome state. Okay, so they can recall the, uh, the feeling good without even having the didactic, uh, verbal thought that's convincing or, uh, telling your mind a story in order to feel good.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so yeah, you can tiptoe, okay, so in and out of these Jhana. So it's not necessarily this graduate to this Jhana, you can tiptoe in between them. There's subtleties and nuances of a wholesome state. So first Jhana would be kind of the bedrock, a wholesome state of mind, a mind that's purified, clearly seeing things, examining things as they are. Okay, so we go from second Jhana to third.

**Speaker A:** With the fading away as well of rapture, I abided in equanimity and mindful, fully aware, still feeling pleasure, with the body. I entered upon and abided in the third Jhana, on the account of which the Noble Ones announce, he has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful.

**Speaker B:** So here, kind of like the Piti, the very energetic joy kind of calms down. So calms down into something a little bit more tranquil. Now you're just relaxed and all your bodily tension is experiencing comfort and relaxation and you kind of settled down from that roller coaster Piti ride.

**Speaker A:** Okay, now you're just chilling.

**Speaker B:** And then finally, the fourth Jhana, with.

**Speaker A:** Abandoning of pleasure and pain. With the previous disappearance of joy and grief, I entered upon and abided in the fourth Jhana, which has neither pain nor pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity.

**Speaker B:** So this one, there's kind of just complete stillness and clarity. There's no real feelings involved. So there's no, there's no Piti, there's no Sukkha, but then there's also no negative feelings. So it's a total equanimity or a total serenity without any energetic sensations that.

**Speaker A:** Go along with it.

**Speaker B:** So it's just experiencing reality with a complete indifference because you're not experiencing pleasure or pain. You're just sitting in clarity and equanimity and serenity. And you're fully aware, so you can see really clearly what's going on. And from here, things can get pretty— when the mind is purified to this extent, it can get magical. So you can go into different types of experiences because you're really investigating the fundamental building blocks of our experience. So you can realize that even space.

**Speaker A:** And time are sensations.

**Speaker B:** Okay, and these are impermanent sensations, so there's all sorts of investigative capacity that.

**Speaker A:** Goes along with the fourth jhana.

**Speaker B:** So it's a useful skill to develop.

**Speaker A:** And it goes into the magical stuff here. When my mind, when my concentrated mind was thus purified, bright, unblemished, rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability. I directed it to the knowledge of recollection of past lives.

**Speaker B:** I.

**Speaker A:** Recollected my manifold past lives, that is, 1 birth, 2 births, 3 births, 4 births, 5 births, 10 births, 20 births, 30 births, 40 births, 50 births, 100 births, 1,000 births, 100,000 births, many eons of world contraction, many eons of world expansion, many eons of world contraction and expansion.

**Speaker B:** So this is up for interpretation, right? What this actually means. World contraction and expansion. But my interpretation would be that, again.

**Speaker A:** Like I said before, space, our experience.

**Speaker B:** Our subjective experience of space and time and of the world, is subject to change. So this is an impermanent phenomena that we're experiencing. So you can experience actually the expansion of the entire universe, or the contraction. But these things can be toyed with and played with, and they're actually malleable when you develop this level of concentration.

**Speaker A:** Or Samadhi, a better word for it.

**Speaker B:** And he talks about all the past lives he experiences, and then he talks about.

**Speaker A:** Rebirth here. This was the first true knowledge attained by me in the first watch of the night. Ignorance was banished and true knowledge arose. Darkness was banished and light arose. As happens in and one who abides diligent, ardent, and resolute. When my mind was concentrated, was thus purified, bright, unblemished, rid of imperfection.

**Speaker B:** Malleable.

**Speaker A:** Wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, I directed it to the knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings. With the divine eye which is purified and surpasses the human.

**Speaker B:** So, uh, all right, see you, Alex. Good to have you. Hi guys, see ya. Thanks for the—.

**Speaker A:** So, uh, seeing with.

**Speaker B:** The divine eye, it's another way to.

**Speaker A:** Say seeing with the eye of the Dhamma.

**Speaker B:** So, um, when you kind of go into a supramundane experience and you're seeing with the eye of the Dharma, or.

**Speaker A:** Discernment.

**Speaker B:** It has the ability to perceive things otherwise not available to the normal.

**Speaker A:** Human cognition, the normal.

**Speaker B:** Experience of seeing with these eyes and directing our attention outward. There's a me here seeing over there. When you're seeing with the Divine Eye, or the Third Eye is essentially another way to say the imagination, right? We can experience things through this Third Eye, so to speak, through the imagination.

**Speaker A:** That doesn't share the same limitations of.

**Speaker B:** The normal human faculty. So this is the realm of— you can have— Carl Jung talks about archetypal.

**Speaker A:** Experiences, the archetypes of the collective unconscious.

**Speaker B:** So people may experience it in dreams, but it's also possible when you enter these states of Samadhi to experience it.

**Speaker A:** In the waking state.

**Speaker B:** So you can experience trippy past life experiences and all sorts of things like that.

**Speaker A:** I saw beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate. I understood how beings pass on according to their actions. Thus, these worthy beings who are ill-conducted in body, speech, and mind, revelers of noble ones, wrong in their views, giving effect to wrong view in their actions, and on the dissolution of the body after death, have reappeared in a state of deprivation, in a bad destination, in perdition, even in hell. But these worthy beings who were well conducted in body, speech, and mind, not revelers of noble ones, right in their views, giving effect to right view in their actions, on the dissolution of the body after death have reappeared in good destination, even in the heavenly world.

**Speaker B:** Thus, with the divine eye which is.

**Speaker A:** Purified and surpasses the human, I saw beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and I understood how beings pass on according to their actions.

**Speaker B:** So this is kind of like the teaching of rebirth. There's a super mundane aspect to it and a mundane aspect to it. So kind of like the mundane aspect is if you do good things in the future, you will reap good results future lifetimes.

**Speaker A:** But.

**Speaker B:** The direct application or the supramundane.

**Speaker A:** Understanding is that there is no real.

**Speaker B:** Self that continues across lifetimes. So the self is arising and passing away in each moment, or your experience.

**Speaker A:** Of yourself is arising and passing away in each moment.

**Speaker B:** So when you're well conducted in your.

**Speaker A:** Speech and your behavior, your view, you have a wholesome state of mind, you.

**Speaker B:** Have a purity, purified state of mind, and you practice and you're diligent in that practice, you will be reborn in heaven realms. So heaven on earth, so to speak. So you can experience very pleasurable states and very comfortable states and very states full of love. And joy and compassion and equanimity. So you can really find that inner freedom and happiness here and now based on the kind of seeds that we.

**Speaker A:** Sow in our own minds.

**Speaker B:** And the reverse is true, you can create, you can make your life a living hell, you can make it a living hell to live in your own mind.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Carl, you raised your hand.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, as far as like the seeing with the eye of Dharma, as I understood, that Sutta is also with interacting with people and seeing through the hells that they're living in and just walking through it with the Dhamma. If you're not looking correctly, you will get dragged back into that state of hell, or just by being surrounded, as you said, Carl Jung's like cloud of consciousness, right? It's just like we're always in it. But if you're looking with the eye of Dharma, you go above it, you get reborn into the realms of heaven, as we call them, right? So that's how I understood it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so that's dependent origination, the cause and effect of things. And you see the cause and effect of beings, yourself and others as well. So you can see this person is angry because of how they train their minds without— I mean, they're training their mind without knowing it to be angry and unwholesome. So, but seeing with the eye of the Dhamma is a sort of transcendence.

**Speaker A:** From the cycle of birth and death entirely.

**Speaker B:** So you see these cycles. Even heaven and hell is nothing to you. It's just unfolding spontaneously, an emergent property of reality, and it doesn't really affect you because the Dhamma sees everything from a transcendent lens. So it sees clearly, it sees the impermanence, it sees the emptiness, and sees the no-self. And it sees the unsatisfactoriness. So it sees that even heaven, even heaven won't satisfy you. It's not to be craved for, it's not to be latched onto. But you can see that the cause and effect. So I'm going to purify my mind and experience less and less Dukkha, but I'm not going to latch onto those experiences or identify with those experiences. And crave for heaven, because that sort of ignorance will just put me in the endless cycle of being reborn and.

**Speaker A:** Reborn and reborn, right?

**Speaker B:** So seeing with the Dhamma is kind of a cutting through or breaking through the cycles altogether and dissolving the whole show of it, or discerning things as they actually are. Which is there's no selves here.

**Speaker A:** Okay?

**Speaker B:** It's all impermanent, transient phenomena, and there's nothing to latch on to, and there's really nothing to worry about, and there's nothing to do. So you might as well be happy and spread it.

**Speaker A:** Okay, here we go.

**Speaker B:** And now we're going to get to the real heart of the Dharma. So he goes through some magical stuff. I mean, I think rebirth is good for most people to think in that way. It's good for Sila. So for the average person, I think karma and rebirth is a good idea to have, whether they understand it from the super mundane vantage point.

**Speaker C:** I think they're good ideas to control a society, right? Society. Won't— you can't expect a whole society to think from a noble perspective.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker C:** To discern whether their actions are wise or unwise, each individual action.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker C:** So instead, there are beliefs like if you do something bad, something bad will happen in the future. If you do something good, something good will happen in the future.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** There are ways of simplifying it for the masses.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Try to be a good person is what it's saying, and you have good things will happen to you. So that's the simple— I mean, I think that's good for everyone. That's good for society, right? But now we get to the heart of the Dharma here.

**Speaker A:** This was the second true knowledge attained by me in the second watch of the night. Ignorance was banished and true knowledge arose. Darkness was banished and light arose, as happens in one who abides diligent, ardent, and resolute. When my concentrated mind was thus purified, bright, unblemished, rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, I directed it to the knowledge of the destruction of the taints. I directly knew as it actually is: this is suffering, I directly knew as it actually is. This is the origin of suffering. I directly knew as it actually is. This is the cessation of suffering. I directly knew as it actually is. This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering. I directly knew as it actually is. These are the taints, so the fetters, right? I directly knew as it actually is. This is the origin of the taints. I directly knew as it actually is. This is the cessation of the taints. I directly knew as it actually is. This is the way leading to the cessation of the taints. When I knew and saw thus, my mind was liberated from the taint of sensual desire. Desire, from the taint of being, from the taint of ignorance. When it was liberated, there came the knowledge, it is liberated. I directly knew birth is destroyed, the.

**Speaker B:** Holy life has been lived.

**Speaker A:** What was needed to be done has been done.

**Speaker B:** Oh, see you, Vedana. It's good seeing you. Good to have you. Okay, so I'm going to start over that paragraph because here's the final finale, the grand finale. Okay, when I knew and saw thus.

**Speaker A:** My mind was liberated from the taint of sensual desire. When it was liberated, there came the knowledge it is liberated. I directly knew birth is destroyed. The holy life has been lived. What was needed to be done has been done. There is no more coming into any state of being.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so this is what I was talking about earlier. You kind of— you wake the big wakey wakey out of birth and death altogether. So you're not coming into a state, you're not arriving anywhere anymore. You have arrived.

**Speaker A:** This is it.

**Speaker B:** The holy life has been lived.

**Speaker A:** This was the third true knowledge attained by me in the third watch of the night. Ignorance was banished and true knowledge arose. Darkness was banished and light arose, as happens in one who abides diligent, ardent, and resolute.

**Speaker B:** Now, Brahman, it might be that you.

**Speaker A:** Think perhaps the recluse Gotama is not free from lust, hate, and delusion even.

**Speaker B:** Today, which is why he still resorts.

**Speaker A:** To remote jungle thicket resting places in the forest. But you should not think thus. It is because I see two benefits that I still resort to remote jungle thicket resting places in the forest. I see a pleasant abiding for myself here and now, and I have compassion for future generations. Indeed, it is because Master Gautama is accomplished, a fully enlightened one, that he has compassion for future generations. Magnificent, Master Gautama, magnificent! Master Gautama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, and showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Gautama for refuge, and to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of Bhikkhus. From today, let Master Gautama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life. All right, so that's pretty powerful stuff.

**Speaker B:** This is the way leading to the end of suffering. So this is sort of the Dhamma has been made clear by the fully enlightened one, and he's holding up a lamp in the darkness to show the.

**Speaker A:** Way, so to speak. And why?

**Speaker B:** So after, after one has attained this.

**Speaker A:** Final knowledge.

**Speaker B:** Why he's still doing this stuff. It's just for fun at this point.

**Speaker A:** Is what it means.

**Speaker B:** Like, why does Dhammarato teach us, and why does, why does he resort to seclusion?

**Speaker A:** Because due benefits. It's pleasant abiding, so it's peaceful.

**Speaker B:** It's enjoyable, it's good, and out of compassion. So this peaceful, pleasant abiding is good for yourself, and it's good for other people too, because it shows other people that it's possible. Whereas in the normal world of things, you might not think happiness is possible because everyone is miserable. So it's actually really good for everyone to have people who are actually happy. And actually enjoying themselves and have a pleasant abiding, right? So okay, that's the end of the Sutta. Now we can open it up for dialogue, thoughts, comments, questions, concerns, any takeaways you guys had from that, what you think about that.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, for me the takeaway in the ending is that the practice still kind of stays. It doesn't go anywhere. He still goes back to it. Like he still goes back to seclusion. He still goes back to the same things. Not necessarily because it's just an endless cycle. Like the things are still coming forward and it doesn't mean that there's an end to all of this. It's just the skill gets better. And it becomes actually a very enjoyable skill to practice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so the benefits of the Dharma and the practice is kind of the gift that keeps on giving, is a phrase that comes to mind. So it's good in the beginning, it's good in the middle, and it's good in the end.

**Speaker A:** So.

**Speaker B:** But this practice, you know, it is a noble undertaking. So it is terrifying, it is horrifying to go into seclusion and to face reality head-on as it is, and to surmount unwholesome states of mind.

**Speaker A:** But it is possible.

**Speaker B:** With the Eightfold Noble Path. So with this practice, this very simple but easily repeatable practice.

**Speaker A:** So if you keep on throwing out.

**Speaker B:** Unwholesome thoughts and you keep on maintaining a wholesome state of mind, the inertia eventually will lead you to places that you never imagined was possible to get to. Sober, at least I thought it was impossible until I experienced it for myself. You can experience— people think they need a drug to experience ecstasy, or they need this, or they need a lover to experience ecstasy. No, you can experience ecstasy with the right practice. This— you have full access to this if you develop the skills. And even ecstasy is not even the best thing that there is. It gets better than ecstasy, believe it or not. So there's nuances and subtleties to the experience of Dukkha, Nirodha, that has various.

**Speaker A:** Levels and qualities.

**Speaker B:** Ultimately culminating in greater and greater clarity and understanding of the workings of things. So, you know, as it actually is, this is suffering, this is the origin of suffering, and this is the cessation of suffering, and this is how to get there. And you see that very clearly. So there's.

**Speaker A:** Really no fear and dread.

**Speaker B:** That comes into your minds. And the kind of darkness is.

**Speaker A:** Banished.

**Speaker B:** And light, inner lights will arise in.

**Speaker A:** You when you understand these things completely and clearly. So that's very beautiful, very profound.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, I think that's a good note to end it.

**Speaker A:** It seems that.

**Speaker B:** The silence can speak for itself. So Once you get yourself into a wholesome, into a clear state of mind, I suggest just try to bask in.

**Speaker A:** It, sit in it silently.

**Speaker B:** This is second Jhana. So second Jhana doesn't need to be as big of a firework show as it might be sometimes. Sometimes it could just be a very.

**Speaker A:** Pleasant.

**Speaker B:** A very nice, tranquil abiding where your body is relaxed and you're just.

**Speaker A:** Soaking up the peace and the seclusion.

**Speaker B:** And again, the breath, the breath is second Jhana. When you're not thinking about the breath and you're just experiencing the breath, that's second Jhana. So those moments when you're just breathing and you kind of get into a rhythm of it and the breath kind of feels good and you stop kind of thinking about it.

**Speaker A:** Now you're just in this moment, just breathing. This is another way to Jhana, is just breath.

**Speaker B:** And it might even be more efficient than thinking about it. But I say both. So the breath and wholesome thoughts, it's kind of like a one-two punch that knocks out the hindrances. You just have to go see for yourself.

**Speaker A:** Practice over and over and over and over again.

**Speaker B:** All right, guys. Well, it's good seeing y'all. Take care. And again, to the YouTube channel.

**Speaker C:** See you, Carl.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, likewise, guys.

**Speaker A:** Take care.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And again, to anyone who might be watching on YouTube, anyone is welcome to come. This is an open dialogue. Please come bring up topics. Talk about things, ask questions. That's how you get better at the Dharma. So if you're watching on the sidelines and you're afraid of dipping your toe in, please come on. We don't bite. Everyone here is friendly. Don't be afraid of asking stupid questions. That's how you learn more and get better. So this is a skill. It is not like it is similar to other skills that participation helps. So actually calling Dhammarato for me, like, made a big difference, and asking questions. So that might be embarrassing, right? So don't be afraid to get embarrassed. It's actually for the good and benefit of yourself. And instead of hiding from it and denying the unwholesomeness, it's better to bring it up, and then we can talk about how to deal with it together with the Sangha.

**Speaker A:** So everyone's welcome.

**Speaker B:** All righty, I'll see you next time, man. Good seeing you.


### Summary

Based on the transcript, here is a summary of the Dhamma talk led by Dhammarato and the Sangha friends:

### **Core Theme: Overcoming Fear & Dread Through Purification and Jhana**
The group discusses the sutta "Mahayana Anicca 4: Fear and Dread," using it as a practical guide for spiritual practice. The central message is that facing inner fear is a crucial part of the path, and it can be overcome through mental purification and the development of meditative absorption (Jhana).

### **Key Points of the Discussion:**

1.  **The Challenge of Solitude:** The sutta begins by acknowledging that seclusion in remote places is genuinely difficult and can "rob a bhikkhu of his mind" if he lacks concentration. The speakers frame this as a "hero's journey" into solitude to confront inner darkness.

2.  **The Necessity of Purification:** Before facing solitude, one must purify their conduct (*sila*). The Buddha recounts that he entered the forest only after purifying his **bodily, verbal, and mental conduct**, and after abandoning the **Five Hindrances** (lust, ill-will, sloth, restlessness, doubt). The analogy is made to using psychedelics: without proper "set and setting" (a purified mind), the experience can lead to negative spirals.

3.  **The Method for Facing Fear:** Even with a purified mind, fear (*bhaya*) and dread (*chambhitatta*) may arise. The Buddha's method is one of **direct confrontation and unwavering resolve**:
    *   When fear arises in any posture (walking, standing, sitting, lying down), he resolves **not to change that posture** until he has subdued the fear.
    *   This means not distracting oneself, coping, or running from the fear, but facing it head-on.

4.  **The Fruit: The Jhānas:** Successfully subduing fear leads to a mind that is calm, concentrated, and ready for deep meditation. The group walks through the progression of the **Four Jhānas**:
    *   **First Jhāna:** Characterized by "applied and sustained thought" (thinking/examining wholesome states), rapture (*pīti*), and pleasure (*sukha*) born of seclusion.
    *   **Second Jhāna:** As confidence grows, discursive thought fades. One abides in a state of inner confidence, singleness of mind, and simply experiences the rapture and pleasure.
    *   **Third Jhāna:** Rapture fades, leaving equanimity, mindfulness, and a tranquil, pleasant abiding.
    *   **Fourth Jhāna:** A state of pure equanimity and mindfulness, beyond pleasure and pain, where the mind is supremely purified, bright, and malleable.

5.  **The "Magical" Fruits of Concentration:** With a mind stabilized in the fourth jhāna, one can direct it to supramundane knowledge. The sutta describes three "true knowledges":
    *   Recollection of past lives.
    *   Seeing the passing away and rebirth of beings according to their karma (the "divine eye").
    *   **The Ultimate Goal:** The knowledge of the destruction of the taints (*āsavas*)—fully understanding the Four Noble Truths. This leads to final liberation: "Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, there is no more coming to any state of being."

6.  **Why Practice Continues After Liberation:** The Buddha explains that even after full enlightenment, he continues to resort to secluded places for two reasons: for his own **pleasant abiding** and out of **compassion for future generations**. The practice itself becomes a joyful, sustainable skill—"the gift that keeps on giving."

### **Practical Takeaways Emphasized by the Group:**
*   The path requires **courageous effort** to face unwholesome mental states.
*   **Purification of conduct (Sila) is the essential foundation** for successful meditation and facing fear.
*   The technique for dealing with fear is **non-avoidance**—meeting it with steadfastness in the present moment.
*   **Jhāna is a natural, accessible skill** that can be developed through persistent practice of cultivating wholesome thoughts and mindfulness, leading to profound happiness and clarity without external dependencies.
*   The ultimate aim is seeing reality "as it actually is" (impermanent, unsatisfactory, not-self), which leads to liberation. The simpler teaching of karma and rebirth is seen as beneficial for societal ethics and motivation.
*   The Sangha encourages **open dialogue, asking questions, and learning through participation** as essential parts of developing this skill.

In essence, the talk is a roadmap from the initial difficulty of the path, through the essential work of purification and confronting fear, to the blissful states of concentration, and finally to the liberating insight that ends suffering.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several key metaphors and stories to explain Buddhist concepts and the meditative journey:

**1. The Hero's Journey / Archetypal Story:**
   *   **Metaphor:** The practice of going into solitude and seclusion is compared to the archetypal "hero's journey."
   *   **Purpose:** To frame the difficult work of confronting inner darkness and fear as a noble, transformative quest. Speaker B says, "there is an aspect of going into solitude... and conquering the darkness, so to speak."

**2. The Remote Jungle Thicket (as a testing ground):**
   *   **Story/Metaphor:** The sutta itself uses the story of dwelling in "awe-inspiring, horrifying" remote jungle thickets, orchards, and tree shrines as the setting where fear and dread are confronted.
   *   **Purpose:** To represent any challenging, solitary environment (physical or mental) where one faces their inner demons. The speakers extend this to modern equivalents like the intense experience of psychedelics or even the psychological punishment of solitary confinement.

**3. Purification as Preparation (The "Set and Setting"):**
   *   **Metaphor:** Purifying one's bodily, verbal, and mental conduct before entering seclusion is compared to ensuring the right "set and setting" for a successful experience, explicitly analogized to preparing for a psychedelic journey.
   *   **Purpose:** To emphasize that proper ethical and mental preparation is crucial to avoid being overwhelmed by "unwholesome fear and dread."

**4. Crossing a Threshold to an Oasis:**
   *   **Metaphor:** Successfully subduing fear and dread is described as "crossing a threshold" or "crossing the desert" to reach an "oasis."
   *   **Purpose:** To illustrate the transformative shift from a state of struggle to one of relief, energy, and clarity (i.e., entering the first *jhana*).

**5. The Proof is in the Pudding:**
   *   **Metaphor:** The confidence of the second *jhana* is compared to "the proof is in the pudding."
   *   **Purpose:** To explain that in the second *jhana*, one no longer needs to think about the blissful state; the direct experience itself (*"the taste"*) is the evidence and source of confidence.

**6. Tasting Experience (First vs. Second Jhana):**
   *   **Metaphor:** The difference between the first and second *jhana* is compared to the difference between thinking about how food tastes versus simply tasting it. Second *jhana* is described as "very Tantric" — just going into the experience without intellectualizing.
   *   **Purpose:** To distinguish the analytical quality of the first *jhana* ("applied and sustained thought") from the direct, non-conceptual absorption of the second.

**7. The Divine Eye / Third Eye / Eye of Dhamma:**
   *   **Metaphor:** The knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings (often called the "divine eye" in translations) is explained as "seeing with the eye of the Dhamma" or the "Third Eye," which is linked to the imagination and accessing archetypal realms (referencing Carl Jung's "collective unconscious").
   *   **Purpose:** To demystify supramundane knowledge, framing it as a refined mode of perception accessible through deep concentration, akin to insightful imagination or visionary experience.

**8. Creating Heaven or Hell in the Mind (Rebirth Metaphor):**
   *   **Metaphor:** The teaching of rebirth is given a psychological interpretation: being "reborn in heaven realms" means cultivating a mind full of "love, joy, compassion, and equanimity" here and now. Conversely, one can "make your life a living hell" in your own mind.
   *   **Purpose:** To present karma and rebirth as immediate, observable mental dynamics—wholesome actions lead to pleasant mental states ("heaven"), and unwholesome ones lead to suffering ("hell").

**9. The Gift That Keeps on Giving:**
   *   **Metaphor:** The ongoing practice of the Dhamma, even after profound insight, is called "the gift that keeps on giving."
   *   **Purpose:** To emphasize that the practice remains beneficial and enjoyable at all stages—"good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end."

**10. Holding Up a Lamp in the Dark:**
    *   **Metaphor:** This is a direct quote from the sutta's conclusion, where the Brahmin praises the Buddha for making the Dhamma clear "as though... holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms."
    *   **Purpose:** To depict the Buddha's teaching as an illuminating guide that dispels the darkness of ignorance, allowing people to see the path to liberation clearly.

These metaphors and stories serve to make ancient Buddhist texts and advanced meditative concepts more relatable, practical, and understandable for a modern audience.
