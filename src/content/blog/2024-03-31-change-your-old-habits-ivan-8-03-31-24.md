### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** And what— while you're figuring it out, you're already in it. What you need to do is to get out of it. And figuring it out is because you're, you're in it. You can hear the language.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** You don't need to figure it out. You can just say, 'Oh, there it is again. There I go again. Never mind. I see that stuff. I see you, Mara.' And be happy that you can see it. You've been feeling bad and feeling like you weren't good enough for many years now, and you thought that that was normal. But now you can begin to change that. You can change it every time that it comes up. You can change it every time that you see it come up. You can just say, yeah, I see that stuff.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Um, yes, and this kind of ties to the question of meditation. And in itself I noticed myself when I was taking a short break of meditating, there was this thought that come up, I need to meditate more so I could be more satisfied, so I can deal with this emotion. So it's the good thing is it kind of devolved. I have this stronger devotion to the practice. But I also think, I'm not sure, I'm just asking, how should I approach this? Like, should I be just, this is good enough, I can deal with this?

**Speaker B:** Well, when you use the word approach it, maybe you got it backwards. Maybe what we need to do again is to leave it. Which is exactly the same thing as you were wanting to figure it out. You don't need to figure it out. You just say, 'Ah, there it is again, and I've handled it before, and I can handle it now. Everything is actually okay. I've just been lying to myself. These are just the old lies that I've been telling myself.' And the reality is that you're okay.

**Speaker A:** Is it normal for practitioner that this thing just come out the more they meditate? I guess this is more like I'm just curious.

**Speaker B:** Let us say that old habits keep coming back. That's the nature of the habits. You started that habit and you give in to it again and again, even with the language that you have of trying to figure it out. You don't have to figure it out. You say, aha, I can see that. Figuring it out is very much like— you remember the story about you're walking down the sidewalk and there you see a dog turd. And you pick up that dog turd and take it into the kitchen, try to make food out of it. And the answer to that is no. Just step aside. You're okay. Those are just old habits, just old thoughts, and you're all right. Everything's all right. Everything is fine. Not a worry in the world. And so what you can do, like you've heard me do many times, is get yourself a set of phrases that you can start saying over and over and over again. Wow, this is okay. Never mind, I can handle this. This is no big deal. No worries, no problems, I'm all right. And you can start saying those things over and over again because you know in reality they're true, that all the problems you've got, you're making them up. You've been making them up for years, and you're in a habit of making up trouble. You make that stuff up.

**Speaker A:** I also notice this form of liking and disliking when these memories or this feeling from the old data arising. This is strong disliking. I don't want to feel this. And I think that's the wrong way to deal with it.

**Speaker B:** Uh-huh. I don't want to feel this is exactly what you've been doing. You're in a state of disliking. What you can say instead is, I can handle this. This is no big deal. You keep saying that over and over again. Take a deep breath and say, I can handle this, I can do this. Those are just old habits, and I see them now. And congratulate yourself for being able to see that stuff. You don't have to fix it, just be happy that you can see it. And begin to change your mind, change your attitude. I can handle this. That you're not a victim to your old bad habits. Now you can see them. Aha, I see that.

**Speaker A:** Um, tying back to this question, I also realize there's this. So I've been trying to be more kinder to myself, as in even during meditation or just in whatever I'm doing. What's my body posture? How I'm breathing? What am I feeling inside? How can I help myself to feel slightly better in all this sort of self-caring way? It feels like I'm— some instance it feels like I'm swimming against the stream. It just feels like because I keep doing this more and more, I know this is good for me, there's this part of me inside that's just rebelling. It's just— I mean, yeah, I It's weird, I really don't understand. I know it's all habit, it's just, it's just so persistent. I don't know.

**Speaker B:** So, see, you know that you can handle this, it's just an old habit.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker B:** And it's time to change your habit. To try to say, "I can handle this.".

**Speaker A:** Is it possible? Is there a way of— maybe I'm wrong. I think I'm wrong. I'm not sure. It's just Basically, I think the word that comes up to my mind is this: is there a form of sadness, a form of grieving that I could feel so that I could easily transition through this? I'm not sure what— like, you know, it feels really hard. I mean, yeah, it's just crazy.

**Speaker B:** Okay, you seem to be really struggling right now. Can you see that you're struggling, trying to get it right, trying to figure it out, trying to figure out the right thing to say? Can you see that? Yeah, you can see that. Okay, and just say, never mind, I don't have to struggle. Never mind, that's okay. I don't have to fix anything. I don't have to make sure. Everything is already all right. Yes, you don't have to fix it. You don't have to figure it out. You can just say, aha, I'm so glad I don't have to figure it out. Say that a couple of times. Let me hear you.

**Speaker A:** Should I say how long?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm okay. I don't have to figure it out.

**Speaker A:** I don't have to figure it out.

**Speaker B:** I'm already okay, I don't have to figure it out.

**Speaker A:** I don't have to figure it out.

**Speaker B:** I don't have to figure it out. You don't have to figure it out, you're already okay, you can just relax. You don't have to figure it out. Everything is already okay.

**Speaker A:** I— is it okay that I'm aware there's the part of me inside that's scared everything's about to go wrong? It's like He wants to find something so nothing can go wrong. But actually, because of me wanting to find out, that's why things go wrong.

**Speaker B:** Nothing goes wrong. The only thing that goes wrong is you have the thought that things go wrong. When you have the thought things are going wrong, you say, "Aha, I see that thought and everything is actually okay." Nothing's going wrong. That's just a thought. You can see those thoughts and change them. Everything's all right, everything is fine, no worries. Keep practicing. You're already okay. Practice being okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay, I will do that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, practice. Everything is okay. You don't have to figure anything out. Nothing's broken. It's just an old attitude that you've had, and you can change that attitude into everything's okay. Nothing's broken, don't have to figure it out, don't have to fix anything. I can just relax and feel safe and secure and comfortable and satisfied.

**Speaker A:** So now, just one last thing is, when I tell myself this and I feel my body tensing up, I just have to keep relaxing it, right? I just have to be aware that it's tensing up and I just have.

**Speaker B:** To— Just take a deep breath. Just never mind that in fact you're tensing yourself up with those thoughts of something's wrong. And when you tell yourself everything is okay, I can relax, then you will relax. You can relax. Everything is okay. You work yourself up into it. You can stop working and let things settle in. Settle, relaxed. Everything is all right, no problems. Can you keep saying that? Let me hear you say it. You keep talking about all your problems. I want to hear you talk about how good you feel.

**Speaker A:** I mean, I've been feeling pretty good in a sense, like, I don't know, just my usual habit. I will be spiraling, I guess, but I'm able to hold myself together.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you can do that. In fact, you can enjoy watching it fall apart. It doesn't matter.

**Speaker A:** Being an observer of what is arising.

**Speaker B:** Learn to have fun seeing what you're doing. There I go again. Aha, I see that. Wow, I really can tense myself up. I'm champion at tensing up. And now I can relax. Just keep coming back, keep coming back over and over again. Keep coming back to everything is all right, everything is fine. Build some new habits. The habit is that you can make this Wow, what a relief it is. Everything's going to be all right. Everything's fine, Ivan. You got no problems, no worries. Everything is okay.

**Speaker A:** I just need to relax myself.

**Speaker B:** Everything's okay. Everything is fine. Not a worry in the world. You keep practicing that. You know that's what I'm going to say, so you start saying the things you know I'm going to say. Everything is all right, everything is fine, no problems. You don't have to figure it out.

**Speaker A:** I will keep doing that.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay. All right, we'll see you in a couple days. You go practice being okay.

**Speaker A:** Oh well, thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** All right.


### Summary

Based on the dialogue, here is a summary of the core Dhamma talk between Dhammarato (Speaker B) and a practitioner (Speaker A):

**Core Teaching: Stop "Figuring It Out" and Realize "Everything is Already Okay"**

The central theme is a shift from problem-solving mode to a mode of relaxed, non-judgmental observation and self-reassurance. The practitioner is caught in cycles of self-doubt, over-analysis, and the habitual feeling that something is wrong and needs to be fixed.

**Key Points from Dhammarato's Guidance:**

1.  **You Don't Need to "Figure It Out":** The attempt to intellectually analyze or "fix" your negative thoughts and emotions is itself the problem. It's compared to picking up dog waste and trying to make food from it—the solution is to simply step aside.
2.  **Acknowledge and Dis-identify:** Instead of engaging, use simple, observational phrases like: *"Oh, there it is again," "I see that stuff,"* or *"Hello, Mara."* This creates space between you and the habitual thought pattern.
3.  **Replace the Narrative with Truth:** Actively counter the old, negative mental habits with truthful, positive phrases. Repeat them like a mantra:
    *   *"Everything is okay."*
    *   *"I can handle this."*
    *   *"No worries, no problems."*
    *   *"I don't have to figure it out."*
    The point is that these statements are *true*—the perceived problems are self-created mental habits.
4.  **Congratulate Yourself on Awareness:** The moment you see the old habit arising is a victory. Be happy you can see it; you don't then need to fix what you see. This changes your relationship to the difficulty.
5.  **Practice Being Okay:** The goal isn't to achieve a future state of okay-ness through struggle. It's to **practice relaxing into the truth that you are already okay in this moment**, despite the passing thoughts and feelings.
6.  **Have Fun as an Observer:** Learn to find relief and even humor in watching your own mental habits. *"Wow, I'm really champion at tensing up!"* This lightens the struggle and reinforces the role of the observer.

**The Practitioner's Struggles (which Dhammarato addresses):**
*   Feeling meditation should be used to "deal with" emotions, creating more striving.
*   Strong aversion (*"I don't want to feel this"*) towards old, painful memories and feelings.
*   Feeling internal rebellion even when trying to be kind and self-caring.
*   A deep-seated fear that "everything is about to go wrong," which fuels the need to figure things out.
*   Physical tension that arises alongside the old mental patterns.

**Conclusion:** The talk is a practical guide to breaking the cycle of self-critical suffering. The path is to **stop the struggle**, **see thoughts as mere old habits**, and **repeatedly relax into the present-moment truth that nothing is fundamentally wrong.** The practice is the gentle, persistent return to the phrases and attitude of "Everything is all right."

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the dialogue, the primary **metaphor** and **story** used by Speaker B (Dhammarato) are:

**1. The "Mara" Metaphor**  
Speaker B references **Mara**, a figure from Buddhist teachings who represents temptation, distraction, and unwholesome mental states. By saying, *“I see you, Mara,”* the speaker frames intrusive thoughts or negative habits as an external, impersonal force to be acknowledged without engaging or identifying with it. This helps create detachment.

**2. The "Dog Turd" Story**  
This is the most vivid metaphor in the talk:  
> *“You’re walking down the sidewalk and there you see a dog turd. And you pick up that dog turd and take it into the kitchen, try to make food out of it. And the answer to that is no. Just step aside.”*  
This illustrates the futility of over-analyzing or “figuring out” negative thoughts — treating them as something useless and even repulsive that should simply be avoided, not examined or “cooked” into something else.

**3. The "Swimming Against the Stream" Metaphor**  
Speaker A describes self-care efforts as feeling like *“swimming against the stream.”* This conveys the struggle of going against ingrained habits and internal resistance.

**4. The "Observer" / "Seeing" Metaphor**  
Throughout the talk, Speaker B encourages **observing thoughts without getting entangled**:  
- *“Aha, there it is again.”*  
- *“I see that stuff.”*  
- *“Be happy that you can see it.”*  
This frames mindfulness as watching thoughts pass by like clouds or noticing a familiar pattern without judgment.

**5. The "Old Lies / Old Habits" Metaphor**  
Negative thoughts are referred to as *“old lies I’ve been telling myself”* and *“old habits.”* This frames them as conditioned, automatic, and not reflective of reality — something that can be replaced with new mental habits.

**6. The "Falling Apart" Reframe**  
Speaker B suggests: *“You can enjoy watching it fall apart. It doesn’t matter.”*  
This turns the fear of losing control into an opportunity for detached observation and even amusement.

**7. The "No Need to Fix" Metaphor**  
A recurring idea is that nothing is broken and there’s nothing to fix — *“Everything is already all right.”* This counters the mindset of problem-solving one’s emotions and promotes acceptance.

These metaphors and stories collectively encourage:  
- **Disidentification** from thoughts (Mara, dog turd).  
- **Acceptance** rather than resistance (observer, old habits).  
- **Changing internal language** (phrases like “I can handle this”).  
- **Letting go of the need to control or figure everything out** (dog turd, no need to fix).
