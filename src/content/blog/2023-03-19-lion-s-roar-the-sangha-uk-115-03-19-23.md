### Transcript


**Speaker A:** That led to the reading of the sutta. But we already have it firmly established that the Buddha is not claiming here any kind of psychic powers at all, but what he does claim actually is superhuman because it's beyond what most humans are capable of doing, and that is being happy by this thinking okay. Go. I'm going to have to dip out at this point. I'll listen to the rest of the talk, um, when later on, and I'll call you next week, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** Thanks very much for this.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. All right, thank you. Goodbye everybody. Cheers.

**Speaker C:** Have a good day.

**Speaker A:** You too. You all of you. Yes, have a good day. Cheers. Ah, okay. So the first— all right, so what 10 actual powers does the Buddha have that gives him a place in assemblies? In other words, what gives him the right to be the boss? Now here's the first one that I invite each one of you to begin to see is a skill. Firstly, the realized one truly understands the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible. That in fact, when we start looking at what magic is, we can begin to understand that there's physical realities here, and those physical realities don't get broken just because somebody made a prayer or said a statement or something. And so whatever happens within that realm of possibilities means that it has to stay within the laws of nature. And there are things that are possible, but a whole lot of the stuff that we dream up in our head, we want it to be true, but it's not. It's impossible. And an example of that would be what the Republicans have been doing since the election in 2020. They have been claiming the impossible, and they can't see that what they're saying is impossible. And this is something that we need to do in our own lives, is to begin to look at what's possible, because being happy, being free, being lighthearted, being joyful, that's possible. Flying through the air— huge part of liberation. And flying through the air so that you can show off your talents. It's not possible. Okay? So, the next one is also quite telling in that, since he truly understands this, this is a power of the realized one relying upon this, he claims the bull's play. Actually, no, this is a follow-on for that first one. Once he knows what's possible and impossible, because he knows this, he truly claims the power of the realized ones. Relying upon this, he claims the bull's place, roars as lions roar in the assemblies, and turns the holy wheel. All right. Further, the realized one truly understands the results of deeds undertaken in the past, future, and present in terms of causes and defects, causes and reasons. Okay, so this is what he's saying is, is that He does not discount the law of karma, but it has to have a connection. It just doesn't happen out of the blue, but there's always a cause and effect that's built into it. It's got to have some reality base, not just wishful thinking. I wish he'd go to hell, you know. That's going to come up in a minute, by the way. Since he truly understands this This is the power of a realized one. What is that? He understands that actions and the results of actions are cause and effect based, they're reality based, they're not magically based the way that most people think of a Kamma machine. Furthermore, the realized one truly understands Where all paths of practice lead. Now that's a very interesting one. Can you in fact see the way that someone is practicing, which way they're going? Can you do that with the distinction between where the Goenka students are headed and where the Mohasi students are headed? Okay, so that's the kind of question that we're asking, is where do these pathways lead? But then it's very— it's got a very ancient answer, by the way, um, and, and it's later on in the sutta where this one is expounded. Furthermore, the realized one truly understands the world with its many and diverse elements. In other words, the Buddha can truly see the complexity of it all, which means Dukkha, Dukkha everywhere. And since he truly understands this, that puts him in the lion's position. Furthermore, the realized one truly understands the diverse convictions of sentient beings. He truly— since he truly understands this, this is the power of the realized one. Okay, so further, he— the realized one truly understands the diverse convictions of sentient beings. Basically, we can say that in the sense that there's no end to the lies that are told, just no end to things. The things get really, really complicated. Okay, so further, the realized one truly understands the facilities of other sentient beings and other individuals after comprehending them with his own mind. Now, we can mistake that in the sense that we think that he's mind-reading again, But carefully, we can look at the Pali and see that all what they're really talking about is, is that by comprehending his own mind, he truly understands the facilities of other human beings and other individuals.

**Speaker C:** Okay, facilities and faculties, the same thing.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, how do we think? Where does that stuff come from? In fact, what he's really talking about here is Paticcasamuppada. We can see how people think stuff up. Yeah. All right. Further, the realized one truly understands corruption, clinging, and emergence regarding the Jhana, liberation, and the attainments. Okay, so here's what we're saying is, is that the word that we're practicing here is that we can see the corruptions. We can see the hindrances, we clean that stuff out, and then we emerge out of our Dukkha. And so this is what is saying here, and every one of you should be Budding Buddhas in the sense that you could do this. You guys can see the difference between what's possible and not, and what's not possible. When I was reading that, I know every one of you had to thought, well, I can tell that. And so in fact, you could say that this group here then is a, uh, a sort of a map or a way that you can actually figure out where you are. Okay, can in fact you understand these corruptions? Can you do that cleaning? And when you, when you get to that point and you have that lion's roar within you, that way you can claim that lion's for seat in the assemblies. All right, now the last three on this list— we've done seven of them and so far so good. We haven't run across anything that some Mahayana is going to croak about. So, um, the next group of three is, is often called the Three Watches of the Night, and it also appears almost verbatim the way that it's stated here in other suttas. All right, so let's look at it. This one, he's not actually referring to it as the three watches of the night, but all three of them are specifically here in order, uh, etc. And so I'll read this off to you and then kind of explain this first one. Furthermore, the realized one, um, recollects many kinds of past Let's put in the word events here rather than lives. That 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, 1,000— I mean, this just goes on and on. How many times have you screwed up? Many eons of world contractions and many eons of world expansion, many eons of world contracting and expanding, and there's never-ending to it. Samsara just keeps rolling. Okay, he remembers, there I was, named this way, my clan was this, I looked like this, this was my food, this is how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place, I was reborn somewhere else, and there too I was named this, my clan, and this was my name, and this I looked like this, and this was my food, and this is how I felt pleasure and blame, and that was how my life ended. And when I passed away from that place, I was reborn somewhere else here. And so he recollects his many kinds of past lives with features and details. So when we read this like that, the way especially that it's translated, we begin to see, well, wait a minute, maybe the Buddha didn't teach just one thing. He's got this side dish here. I mean, he had a hamburger, sure, but now You got fries. What are we going to do with this? And the answer is that if we understand that it's in symbolic language, that you too, you don't have to go all the way back 3,500 years or whatever, but since you are a kid, you can recognize that you got named different names. There were times when you ate a kind of food the way that you ate it. And there's no end to the kinds of memories that you can come up with once you start practicing Anapanasati. In fact, that's one of the things that people keep looking for, that, "Hey, if I keep digging far enough back in the past, I'll go past the wound," and that's what they're kind of hoping for. But meanwhile, we have a rich past, and the people who practice meditation really do pick that stuff up. And can remember. And that I was lucky in the sense that I moved around starting when I was 7, and so I remember all the stuff that happened before I was 7 in, you know, the imagery and whatnot of the location that we lived in, in Shawnee, Oklahoma. And then after that, every year we moved, and so that gives me a frame of reference of all of that stuff that I remember. And the most rich one was the early part. I really remember so much. I could spend a whole hour talking about what happened to me when I was— nobody cares about that stuff other than the fact that it's there, and it's there for you to discover yourself. You can remember what happened. That's so— then the next thing is, is that he understands this in the sense of a power to be able to remember correctly. All right, furthermore, here the word clairvoyance is used. Okay, further, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, the realized one sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or in a bad place. He understands how Sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. These dear beings did bad things by the way of their body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of noble ones, and they had the wrong view, and they chose to act out in that wrong way view. When their bodies break up after death, they are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body speech and mind. They never spoke ill of the nobles. They had right view. They, uh, they chose to act out of right view. When their bodies break up after death, they're reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. And so with the clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, he sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place, and understands how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. So, we can either take this magically, which this whole sutta is not, or we can take it and break it down to understand that in fact, this is the second watch of the night, this is midnight. And also, it follows on from, if you can remember and recollect and see what was going on in your causes and effects in your own life, then you recognize that everybody else's doing the same thing. Here we go, coming and going. Imagine that instead of you're some Buddha up in heaven looking at the coming and going of the beings the way that we can imagine, imagine instead that you're just in a high floor of a building and you're looking down upon a store, let us say a hardware store, and you see people entering the hardware store and coming out, some of them coming out with a great big package, others are coming out disappointed and all of that. This is a way of looking at the coming and going of beings, because the guy who went into that store was not the same guy who came out of the store. He changed while he was in the store. He might have met an ugly girl or a beautiful girl or something, and his mind has been changed now. That we don't have to wait until the breakup of the body, but we do know that when we do bad deeds, we're going to wind up in the hell that we make for ourselves. Or if we feel generous and grateful, then we wind up in a much better place. And it doesn't have to be done magically. In fact, when we put the magic in it, we almost lose the power of it. And this clairvoyance that is used here, that actually only means clear seeing. And you can begin to see clearly some of the people that you're around, the various moods that they go through. And in fact, if you watch carefully on this screen with those who have the videos turned on, you can see the various moods that people are going through while they're listening to this talk. And so this is the point that we're making on this one, is that we can see people, we can see their behaviors, we can see the states that they go in and out of. And except for a few professions like some psychologists, most people can't do that. They're more interested in what they think and feel rather than looking at somebody else and seeing what states they're going through. And this is why this is called superhuman. It's not that it's impossible for humans, it's that it's a skill to be learned. And so this is the second watch of the night, and it also has an intention when we look at the third watch of the night, because the third watch of the night, starting in the US Navy at about 4:00 AM, goes until sunlight. So think of the third watch of the night as kind of like immersion from the dark night of the soul that is happening in this one. Is when we see what crap people make for themselves, and we see that we were doing it to ourselves too. So the next one is, further, the realized one has realized an undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. So freedom by wisdom in this very life actually then cuts through all of the magic stuff that was in the first two anyway, right there, this very life. It's finished. So we find the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And so we can live having realized it with our own insight due to the ending of defilements. Okay, so this is the whole point of what this practice is all about, is when we bring an end to the defilements then we have this undefiled freedom of heart right here in this very life. We don't have to worry about the past and the future. But here it is. Since he truly understands this, this is the power of the realized one. Relying upon this, he claims the bull's place, roars the lion's roar in the assemblies. And turns the holy wheel. A realized one possesses these 10 powers of the realized one. With these 10, he claims the bull's place, and he roars the lion's roars in the assemblies. When I know and see this way, suppose we saw this. Now, this is kind of a repetition of what we've been talking about before. And giving some examples. The aesthetic Katana has no supernatural distinction in knowledge and worthiness of the noble ones. He teaches what he worked out by logic following the line of inquiry expressed by his perspective. Unless they give up this speech and that thought and let go of those views, they will be cast down into hell. All right, now we can see that being cast down to hell is the view of a translator, that if someone is cast down to hell, then there's got to be a castor, someone to do the throwing. A better way of talking about this would be this way, kind of slang: unless this guy gives up that kind of thought and speech, to hell with him. Now that's the way that the actual Buddha is putting it. Just the hell with this guy. Just as a mendicant accomplished in ethics, immersion, and wisdom would reach enlightenment in this very life, such is the consequence, I say, unless they give up that speech and thought and give up that view, the hell with them. Sariputta, a realized one, has four kinds of self-assurance. With these claims, he gets the bull's place. He wars the lion's war in the '70s and turns the holy wheel of the Dharma. What for? I see no reason for anyone, whether ascetic, Brahman, god, Mara, Brahman, or anyone else in the world, to legitimately scold me, saying 'You claim to be fully awakened, but you don't understand this or that.' Since I see no such person, I live secure, fearless, and assured. I see no reason for anyone, whether ascetic, Arhat, Anagami, Anapanasati, or anyone else in the world, to legitimately scold me, saying, 'You claim to have ended all defilements, but These defilements are not ended. In other words, what defilements are you speaking of that the Buddha has? And since there is no such, I live secure, fearless, and assured. I see no reason then for the next group to scold me. The acts that you say are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them. Now here, this is an important one. It actually is mentioned in other suttas in the sense of obstructions. We can think of it in the sense of the hindrances. So these obstructions or hindrances for some are not really obstructions, but the Buddha says, "No, these obstructions of the mind are obstructions and you have to remove them." But there are some kinds of practices like Anicca and Mahayana and others like that, that don't really follow that because they say, "Well, you have to see the obstructions, you have to know what they are, you have to see what's in the mind." But in that regard, by seeing them not yet, they're really not obstructions because if they were, we would throw them out immediately. And so this is a point then that we can say that in correct practice we can see obstructions as obstructions and then throw them out, because they are obstructing what we're doing right now. And so the Buddha says that these are obstructions and you can't claim that they're not obstructions because they prevent you from getting into the states of Anicca, let us say, being free from wanting to be reborn somewhere. And so, since I see no reason exists, I live secure, fearless, and assured. The next one: There's no reason for any of those guys who legitimately scold me, saying the teaching doesn't lead those who practice it to the complete ending of suffering, the goal for which it was taught. Anagami. Ah, now here's something very interesting. That is, that basically what it's saying is, is that we have good solid evidence, in fact, that it does work, that the practice that the Buddha laid out is there for the complete ending of suffering. That's the goal for which this stuff is taught. And so the Buddha says is that since we've got good results, I see no such reason to say that it doesn't work, and so he can live secure, fearless, and assured. So the Buddha has these four kinds of self-assurance. With these, he claims the bull's place. He roars the lion's roar in the assemblies and turns the holy wheel. When I know and see in this way, suppose someone were to say this: the ascetic, the Tama, has no superhuman distinction in knowledge and wisdom worthy of the noble ones. Unless they give up that speech and thought and let it go, to hell with them. Siriputta, there are these 8 assemblies. Which 8? The assembly of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, ascetics, the assembly of gods, the 4 great kings, the assembly of the gods under the 33, and the assembly of the Maras, the assembly of Brahmins. These are the 8 assemblies. Possessing the 4 kinds of self-assurance, the realized one approaches and enters right into these 8 assemblies. In other words, once you get your mind together and you are the lion then you can go anywhere. You can go into any assembly. It doesn't matter where it is. It can be the Congress of this country or the palace of that king or whatever like that. You're the dude. You walk in there, you own the place. I recall having approached the assembly of the 100 aristocrats. There I used to sit with them, converse, and engage in discussion. But I don't see any reason to feel afraid or insecure. Since I see no such reason, I leave secure, fearless, and assured. I recall having approached an assembly of the hundred Brahmins, the householders, the ascetics, the Anagami, the poor, the great 33, the Maras, the Brahmins. There too I used to sit with them, converse, and engage in discussion, but I don't see any reason to ever feel afraid or insecure. Since I see no such reason, I live secure, fearless, and assured. I can hear the lion now. When I know and see in this way, suppose someone were to say the aesthetic Dhamma has no superior distinction in knowledge and wisdom worthy of the noble ones. Unless they give up that speech and thought, the hell with them. Sariputta, there are these four kinds of reproduction. Now why this is there, I'm not really sure, but I'll go quickly through it. It's like the womb, the egg, water or moisture, and spontaneous. And the Buddha knows this kind of stuff, but this is really, let us say, a 2,500-year-old biology course that doesn't hit modern times. We've got a better understanding than the Buddha did about this stuff. And so there are these 5 destinations. What 5? The hell, animal realm, ghost realm, humanity, and the asuras, the gods. And so you've heard me talk about this stuff before. These are the woeful states plus the human state. And so what he's saying here is, I understand hell and the path and practice that leads to hell. And I understand how someone practicing that way with their body heads up after death is reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underlying world. Now here's something that's kind of interesting. When you go to the Pali of this, the word 'when their body breaks up' is only one kind of usage for the word 'kayasā.' That 'kaya' actually does mean body, but the other definitions is the person who's doing the action. In other words, it may be not the body that's breaking up, it's the mental state that I'm in. And so this is a case of the confirmation bias of the translator, because he's got better definitions of the words that he chooses, the one that fits his belief system. Okay, and the word reborn is not there either. A better way of actually translating this would be that, uh, I understand how someone practicing in such a way When they change their mind, they wind up regretting it. And I understand the animal realm. Then in fact, we talk about the animal realm quite a lot. What is the animal realm? Is the actual realm of doing what you were told to do without getting the reward, like working at a job and the bosses get the benefit. Or the next one is the ghost which is actually the hungry ghost, and the human and the gods, etc., like this. And so we'll skip through this. And I understand how someone practicing in this way realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. Again, in this very life. And lives having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of their defilements. So this is actually the important part of it, is that people can in fact have magical beliefs, but when they really understand the teachings, it's always to be free right here, right now, not off into the future sometime. When I have comprehended the mind of a certain person, I understand this person is practicing in such a way and has entered such a path that when their body breaks up after death, they will be reborn in a place of loss, a bad state, an underworld, a hell. When sometime later I see that they have indeed been reborn in hell, there are my experiences exclusively pain, excessively painful feelings, sharp and severe. And so the Buddha is saying that when we perform our acts in a certain way, The wisdom of the Buddha is that we can see which way people are headed. And so the next section is all about that, about that we can see. And he's got a number of analogies here about how people are reborn in these various places because of their behavior. But we keep doing this over and over again. It's not a matter of waiting until after you're dead to have the bad experiences. We keep having those in this life, and we can be free from them in this life. All right, and so I'm scrolling through here. I found the longhouse, which is understood to be heaven. And suppose there was a lotus pond with clear, sweet, cool water, clean, smooth, with the banks, smooth banks, and delightful. And nearby was a dark forest grove. Then along comes a person struggling with oppressive heat, weary, thirsty, and parched, and they have set out on a path that meets with this same lotus pond. If a person with good eyesight saw this, they'd say this person is proceeding in such a way and is entering such a path that they will arrive at Anagami, the Lotus-Born. In other words, you can see how things are headed. This is basically the definition of wisdom, is you can see which way people are going, you can see the way that they're headed, and you can see a lot of situations. You can see where this situation is going. And so this is one of the skills that we develop that we can call wisdom, is we can see how things are headed. All right, let me see here. This is actually quite a long sutta, and it's repeated in other places. A lot. Sariputta, I recall having practiced a spiritual path consisting of 4 factors. I used to be self-mortified, ultimately self-mortified. I used to live rough. Okay, so here is a long, long explanation of what he was doing. This is also in Sutra number 26 and Sutra number 36, about how rough he lived, how little food he ate, jujube berries and only a little bit of grains of rice and things like that. And so, the next section of the— like an example, due to eating so little, the skin of my belly stuck to my backbone so that when I tried to rub the skin of my belly, I grabbed my backbone, and when I tried to rub my backbone, I rubbed the skin of my belly. So he's getting pretty desperate there with all of that stuff. There are some ascetics of Brahmins who have the doctrine in view that purity comes from food, and so he eats only mung beans and then later ordinary rice and all of that kind of stuff. But Sariputta: "I did not achieve any superhuman distinctions in knowledge and vision worthy of the nobles by that conduct." And he was doing that for years. He practiced that kind of grueling work for years and years, and he got nothing out of it, except the knowledge that he did the right thing. And that's not the path. And so going back up to where the Buddha knows what is the path and what is not the path is because he's been down the wrong path pretty far, much further than most people take it. Because I die trying. Yeah, you think you're tough? Look what the Buddha did. I didn't achieve any noble wisdom that's noble and emancipated and which leads someone who practices it to the complete end of suffering. There are some Brahmins and ascetics who have this doctrine in view, that purity comes from transmigration. Now I do not know why this guy who translated this used the word transmigration, but boy, it sounds rebirthy, doesn't it? Actually, in the Pali, it's using the word Samskara. Which basically just means round and round, um, or, or traveling. Okay, the wanderer. Um, but it is, but it is not easy to find a realm that I haven't previously wandered into, the Buddha says, to in all this long time, except for the gods of the pure abodes. Because if I hadn't been, if I had gone to there, I wouldn't have come back here. And there are some ascetics and Brahmins who have the doctrine in view that purity comes from rebirth. Actually, the Pali has something completely different than that. It has just coming into existence, basically. Purity comes from existence. And the translator uses the word 'rebirth,' but there is no rebirth quality there. It's just part of the confirmation bias that is in these suttas. But it is not easy to find any circumstance that I haven't previously been in. In other words, he's basically saying, 'Been there, done that.' And this is the attitude that we want to begin to develop of, 'Oh, I don't have to go explore that. I've been there, I've done that.' Yoga, been there, done that. Boxing, been there, done that. You know, that's the kind of attitude that we want to develop. That there are some ascetics and Brahmins who have this doctrine in view, that purity comes from abode of rebirth. But there, it's not easy to find an abode or a house where I haven't been abiding. There are some ascetics and Brahmins who have the doctrine in view that purity comes from sacrifice. But it is not easy to find a sacrifice that I have not previously offered in all of this time, and when I was anointed aristocratic king or well-to-do Brahmin. There are some ascetics and Brahmins who have the doctrine in view that purity comes from serving the sacred flame. But it is not easy to find a fire that I haven't previously served in all of this long time, and when it was, um, uh, when I was an Anagami, uh, aristocratic king, or a well-to-do Brahmin. Okay, so he's, he's on into having the attitude of whatever they say you need to do in order to be purified, the answer is yeah, I tried that. Been there, done that. So long as this gentleman is youthful, young, black-haired, blessed with youth in the prime of his life, he will be endowed with perfect lucid wisdom. But when he is old, elderly, and senior, advanced in years, he has reached the final stage of his life, 80, 90, he will lose his lucid wisdom. So that's the standard belief, is when you get old, you go nuts. And that's very common, it happens. I mean, they call it Alzheimer's or whatnot, that, and a lot of people lose it, but not everybody. Then in fact, you can keep it all the time. Jesus Buddha says, but now I am an old elderly senior, I'm advanced in years, and I have reached the final stage of life of about 80. Suppose I had 4 disciples and with the lifetime of 100 years, and they were perfect in memory, range, and retention, and perfect lucidity of wisdom. Imagine how easily a well-trained expert archer with a strong bow might shoot an arrow across the shadow of a palm tree. That's how extraordinary these memory, range, and retention of these guys were. They bring up questions about the four kinds of mindfulness and meditation again and again, and I would answer each question and they'd remember the answers and not ask the same question twice. And they paused only to eat and drink and do the toilet and sleep and dispel weariness. But the realized one would not run out of Dhamma teachings, words and phrases of the teachings, and spontaneous answers. And at all the end of 100 years, my 4 disciples would pass away. Even if you have to carry me around on a stretcher, there there will never be any deterioration of the realized one's lucidity of wisdom. Okay? What he's really saying here is that you require of yourself to keep yourself sharp. You do things that keep your mind sharp. You don't forget to sharpen your mind, you keep it going. And a lot of people will do a whole lot of stuff and they say, "Oh, well, I'm retired and I'm sad and lonely and whatnot like that. And so they kind of forget what's going on in life rather than staying up with it. And so this is also a recommendation of the Buddha, is to not let your wisdom slide. Stay sharp. Now, this is about the end of it. We've come to the end. So now at that time The venerable Anagami was standing behind the Buddha, fanning him. Then he said to the Buddha, "This is incredible, sir. This is amazing. While I was listening to you with this exposition of the teaching, my hair stood on up." And what was the name of exposition of the teaching. Well, uh, Nagasalama, you may remember this exposition of the teaching as the hair-raising discourse, and yet it's still named the other. Uh, that was said, satisfied. Venerable Nagasalama was happy with what the Buddha had said. And so that's the end of the Maha Sangha, Dhammarato, Sukkha. So we were able to get it into about an hour or so, and I'm surprised. Does anybody have any questions? I mean, this is a long, long thing and nobody stopped me, and so we just kept plowing through it.

**Speaker C:** Why are you surprised?

**Speaker A:** Because it's kind of confusing and people have doubts and they really, really want to grab me by the throat and say, 'Ain't true.' Really? But all you guys are hanging in there. That's, that's good. That's what makes the Dhamma noble as opposed to ordinary. That ordinary Dhamma is magic-filled, is what people want, and they don't get what they want and they're unhappy. But the noble Dhamma is forget about the stuff you can't have, stay with what's possible, and go get that and be happy.

**Speaker C:** I guess the faculties and the conviction mechanisms, or the mechanisms that lead to certain convictions, are can quite differ from being to being, from individual to individual. So there are probably some individuals and some sentient beings who are quite different from us.

**Speaker A:** Can you explain a little bit more about that?

**Speaker C:** Not now.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Because I'm not really following you. Maybe you could just say it again. Okay, give the old ears— they don't pick up everything. So does anybody have any questions, anything to say, anything you found remarkable?

**Speaker D:** Yes, I do. So, hello. So at the beginning, I'm not sure I really understand properly, but I don't know if it's you who say that mind reading is not possible or if it's the sutta who say that. I know that, like for example, in Yoga Sutra, they say that as well.

**Speaker A:** They say what as well? They say which one as well? Can or cannot?

**Speaker D:** No, cannot.

**Speaker A:** Okay, all right.

**Speaker D:** Yes. And also in Yoga Sutra, they warn about the Siddhis, for example. But yeah. But.

**Speaker A:** Um, ah, that's an interesting point. Yes, because the warning about the cities is, is that it's fire. If you play with fire, you're going to get burned. Um, but there, uh, there's another Pali word that actually fits very closely. It's idhi or idhiya, and that is also a magical— but they're not magical powers in the sense of real magical. They're Skills, they're real powers.

**Speaker D:** Okay, yeah, so that's what I wanted to, because you, so the sutras say that it's not possible, right? That's the sutra that say that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay, magical powers are not possible, but real mental powers are possible.

**Speaker D:** Oh, okay, yeah, so that's what I wanted to ask, because after that you talk about Paticcasamuppada and you say that If you understand Paticcasamuppada, then you can like rewind and understand the state of mind, right?

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, you can see that. Also, the important point about reading other people is with their behavior, that you can see what people are feeling quite often because they're not trying to disguise it. But it is possible for someone to disguise their true feelings and we don't know it, okay? Just like sometimes we don't know when someone's lying to us. We don't know it until we go back and put two and two together and do some research and, and, uh, do some more investigation. And so this is what, in a way, um, We can say that if we think that we can read somebody's mind, then we'll make a very quick choice and we'll often be wrong. We need to keep looking, keep gathering data. We need to wait until there's some incongruencies, inconsistencies, or if we can go for a while without any incongruencies and inconsistencies. An example of that Uh, let me give you two of them. No. Here's another one. Yes. Does anybody see those incongruencies? Okay, here's one that's a little more subtle. Uh, my mommy will be right back. Okay, did you see this? That nodding of the head means I want you to believe me. Mommy's right in there and I'm not going to let you know because she wants me to lie to you. So I'm out here as a junior liar saying she's not here, and then I— please believe me. All right, so these are many of the inconsistencies that Of course we can see that, that in fact many people in our time are skilled at that. Certain FBI agents, certain kinds of detective cops, some psychologists, etc., like that, become quite skilled at being able to read, but they're not reading minds. What they're reading is behavior.

**Speaker C:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] And they're always making clear, they're always making clear if they say something about those things. That you need a lot of experience, a lot of protocols, a lot of checklists, a lot of environmental factors and capacity, and this and that and this and that. And then in the end, it could be wrong.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. So here's an example of that. When I cross my arms like this, many, many of the psychologists will say, well, that's a defensive maneuver. Watch out, because he's not buying your crap. Okay, but it may not. It may be that it's just as comfortable. Here's another one. This means he's really not buying your crap. He's showing his armpits. But in fact, no, I've seen people, students, who were really into the Dharma laying on the bed and just dressed out. And I can't make that old saw, oh, they're not getting it, because I can see the rest of the smile on their face, etc., like that. So There is actually quite a lot of data. It's complicated. Pay attention. Watch closely. Now, I think was what we talked about last week is watch really, really closely within our own minds. And then we begin to look closely at what other people are doing. But under no circumstances do we want to get to the point of believing our own stuff in the sense of saying, I can read somebody's mind. Because you're likely with that attitude to walk into a car dealership and get sold a boat. So don't get the attitude that you really know what other people are thinking, because some people are really skilled at getting away with being believable when in fact No, you got to do more investigation. You got to look, you got to check the evidence, etc., like that. An example of that is never take one news source. Don't take just one local newspaper or whatever like that. You got to get a broader range of it. And that's also true. Here's another very strange example to follow on with recent talk. I think that it was on this one when we were talking about— no, it was just yesterday on the other one when we had the topic of Upekkha. And one of the qualities of Upekkha in the fourth jhana is that the mind is so steady that we can actually see clearly right then and there. However, even in the first jhana, if we keep looking and keep looking and keep examining and keep noting will be like getting a collage of photos, like a video or whatever like that, of one image after another, after another, after another, and these images then begin to fill things in, so that in fact by consistently working with the first Jhana, you can see as clearly as if you were in the fourth Jhana, but you can do it in the fourth Jhana really quickly. I mean, you can get that camera stat and then you take that picture and then you got it. But you can also take pictures like this and still put the collage together and figure it out that way. So I wanted to add that to it in the sense of what we're talking about here with looking at other people is to keep examining, keep looking, keep noting, keep watching their smiles, keep looking at their nodding of the head. Etc., like that. And pretty soon you'll get a feel of what's going on. And when you're good at it, they think you're mind-reading, when in fact you're not. You're just observing.

**Speaker C:** And if you're really good at it, you make that they see for themselves that what they're thinking is delusional.

**Speaker A:** Ah yeah, if you've got a black heart. Exactly. Yeah. But that's one of the dangers of having these skills, is that you have to be able to use them for the benefit of the other person rather than taking advantage of them. And so it has to be done altruistically, which means without being selfish. That most of the people who want magical powers, they want so selfishly. So that I can fly through the air and you could see me from the ground, or so that I can buzz my finger at you like Harry Potter and you fall over, or other things like this. It's a matter of power, and I, you know, want to have that power because without that power I feel insecure. And so this is part of the greed for all of that power. But when you're already fearless, like the Buddha is talking about in this sutta, go ahead and get your your fearlessness going so that you can walk into any assembly and communicate with those folks, and you don't have to be afraid of anything. Because you're afraid of them, you'll probably lie to somebody, and then you'll get caught doing that. But if you can keep your fearlessness going, that you belong here, you're the boss, you've got the lion's roar. You got your mind together, you got the Samadhi mind, and you're the lion in the assembly. And so this is the kind of attitude that we start to develop with the Eightfold Noble Path. And so that's why it becomes noble in that regard, is because we actually do start developing these 10 skills. Then in fact, people nowadays, in this generation, in this particular century, we could say people are in general a whole lot more skilled at being able to tell the difference between what's possible is possible and what's impossible is impossible. But think about it, 100 years ago, 200, 300, 500, 1,000 years ago, 2,500 years ago, So back then, we didn't have any science, we didn't have any medicine, they didn't even know about biology, they had these spontaneous things that would happen because they couldn't understand it, they couldn't have any explanation about it. And so, in the old days of the Buddha, that was a major hurdle for most people, that they couldn't figure out what was possible and what was impossible. In fact, look at how hard it is today for some people to figure out what's possible and what's impossible. I mean, for Donald Trump to be the next President of the United States, that's impossible. Forgive me for that one, that's a joke. I don't know what's going to happen in the future. And in fact, not knowing the future is possible. Knowing the future is impossible. We don't know the future. That's impossible to know the future. The question is, when it ever comes, are you going to be happy enough to greet it? Are you going to be unhappy because it didn't match your expectations? Well, practice now to be satisfied, and then when the future comes, you can be satisfied then too. You got your act together, you got your mojo, you got your lion's roar, you got your security blanket. And so, I offer you this sutta to go back and reread it, perhaps hear this lesson, because in a way, it's not pointing way up there as to where the Buddha is, but rather he's giving instructions. He's given instructions about how to take this thing on, to be able to.

**Speaker C:** Have— May you all, may you all don't stop till you understand what you need to understand to practice correctly and reap the fruits.

**Speaker A:** Yes, may you all get there, at least within the next breath or two. There you go. I got you.

**Speaker D:** So can you write the reference in the chat, please, of the sutta?

**Speaker A:** Yes, I will. Thank you. In fact, I'll also go so far as to send the actual link of the sutta that I'm reading. Here we go. It's in the Majjhima Nikaya and it's number 12, The Lion's Roar. Actually, it's the Maha, so it's the big lion's roar. Yeah, and it's good now you can read it because you know where the pitfalls are, so that you recognize that what the Buddha teaches is available to everybody and it's not magical. So know what's possible. So does anybody have any final remarks? Jamie, do you have anything to say?

**Speaker B:** Um, no, I find it interesting that there's this almost like two strands in the sutta where one of them is, you know, saying, hey, you don't need this stuff, this stuff doesn't even make sense, it doesn't even connect to what we're talking about when we talk about Buddha, Dharma. And then on the other hand, there's these big, like, it almost seems like the sutta is trying to say that the Buddha does have such powers even as he's also saying that he doesn't have them, or it's not important.

**Speaker A:** Exactly so. And much of that can be understood as the bias that the translators, who are native English speakers, are putting into the sutta. That they add that, that in fact the word rebirth and nothing about rebirth is anywhere in any of the Pali of the suttas, and yet it's all over the place. You saw it 4 or 5 times listed in the Sutra Mon. It's because the people who are doing the translating, they're still students. They don't really understand. And here's the bad— here's the worst part of it. Those who really know the suttas have no reason to do their own translation because they already can read. It's only those who don't understand the Dharma that are doing the translations out of their own need. And you can say, well, that's true for any book. The reason why somebody would write a book is to get their thoughts together, organized in a way that they understand it correctly for themselves. Bye-bye, Kath. And so we have to be careful about the way that the books are saying that. In fact, this is part of the reason why this particular sutta that I sent with this particular website is because the Pali is available for you to write line by line. And then it's got a click-on dictionary. You can click on the Pali words and actually get a dictionary and recognize that many of these words have more than one definition. Why did the guy choose that one? Yeah, like they always translate the word deva to be a god, to where in fact there's a complete different definition that you know of yourself when I describe it to you. And there is not only the ones who were devas who were actual gods, there is the devas of humans who think that there are gods. Hollywood celebrities, for instance, are called devas. Some kings, um, that in fact, uh, not only, uh, the pharaohs of Egypt but the emperors of Rome, they wanted to become a god, right? Pharaoh's big dude, he's important, let's pray for him enough and get enough gold out of it and he'll become a god. All right, so this is the whole idea, is, is that it's humans. When we use the word Deva, we may in fact not be necessarily talking about things that don't exist. We could in fact see the word deva as something that's actually possible. A deluded human being who thinks he's a god, a celebrity. Well, hello, guest. We're just about to finish up. We've been going on for an hour. I highly recommend that you watch this video. It will be right there on your screen when we finish. Okay, so, uh, well, that was Jamie, right? So Jamie, does that answer your question?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, it does. I, I just wonder, like, if in the Buddhist countries there's— there seems like there is a big, uh, belief in rebirth as well. It's not just the translators.

**Speaker A:** There is absolutely— that's true. It's the ordinary, low-class, regular people. And then in fact, in Thailand, it's the— Bhikkhu Buddhadasa appeals to the aristocrats, he appeals to the university students, that in fact, at one time He was highly, highly regarded by the judiciary of Thailand, which included all of the judges, all of the courts, all the lawyers, all of the legal students in universities would all get on buses and come down to Wat Suwan Mok. And that kind of group now are the ones who really support Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. And I would say that he has literally millions of followers here in Thailand. With huge amounts of money backing it up and all of that kind of stuff. That Bhikkhu Buddhadasa is really big here in Thailand, but he's almost unknown in the West. Now, he's the one who wants to let it out of the bag. Let's go ahead and let the Noble Dharma out so that many people can get the Noble Dharma, and it will— and we'll leave it to those the farming community and the ordinary folks to stay in their belief systems. Let rednecks be rednecks. Let's get some high-quality people who are capable of really understanding the way things actually are, and we can train them into the noble arts. It's sorry to say, but most of the human race is too stupid to understand the Dhamma. So you guys are really, really lucky. Congratulations. It is simply not for everybody.

**Speaker C:** It doesn't matter.

**Speaker A:** Well, so long as you can be happy, you can treat those people happily, and everything is okay. That they may mistreat each other is not your business. That you treat them well, that's your business.

**Speaker C:** Well, the difference is that people do what their faculties are. And so if you change the structure, if you change the faculties, if you can, you can. If you can't, you can't.

**Speaker A:** Ah, it depends, in fact, on whether they can see Dukkha just a little bit. That there are those who blame all of their problems and woes on other people. There are others who blame all of their problems and woes on some savior that's going to save them. It takes a kind of a smart person, an intelligent person, to recognize that you got yourself into this mess. There's only you who can get yourself back out of it.

**Speaker C:** Well, if that would be true, I wouldn't be here.

**Speaker A:** Oh, oh, you want me to get you out of it, or you think you can get yourself out of it on your own practice?

**Speaker C:** Well, if I, if I could do that in the first place without getting, let's say, some changing code for the fragmentations. See, it's— we're interdependent, we're not isolated.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. So whatever.

**Speaker C:** Whatever, whatever we— however we decide to judge someone or not.

**Speaker A:** Well, if we're in the habit of judging, then we'll probably judge folks. The point I guess I was making before is that each one of us has to do the work ourselves, but it's good to have— it's like this. You're going to have to build your own house, but here are the drawings. You follow these drawings and you get your wood and build your house. Okay, that's the way of looking at it. Or it's a map. The teachings of the Buddha is like a map, but you're going to have to do it. You're going to have to build the house.

**Speaker C:** Or exactly right, exactly right. And some people are able to draw their own map and even get to the— get to the end point. Point, and some people need someone who gives them a blueprint.

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker C:** And some people not even— some people are not even capable of doing it with the blueprint. They need more.

**Speaker A:** That's exactly right. In fact, they want— now they want a builder to go build the house for them, which that can't happen. We're going to have to build it for ourselves. But I'm very grateful that I did get that set of plans from Bhikkhu Buddhadassa so I could build my own little palace here, because without it I wouldn't have been able to do it. Couldn't have figured it out on my own. I know that a few people can, like Eckhart Tolle and the Buddha and maybe Jesus and Socrates and a few of them. I mean, we've had a few people on the planet Earth who were able to figure it out all on their own, each one having their own language. I wasn't one of them. I'm really glad I got it as a gift.

**Speaker C:** So there is basically no difference between all of us.

**Speaker A:** That's right. There's no difference. In fact, if you want to, there's a sutta about it. I think it's Sutta number 103 or something like that. It's where right after the Buddha's death, that Ananda is out on Pindavat, and he's asked that very question about what made the Buddha so special. And the answer to that was, is that the only thing he did was he figured out the path to do it. But after we all know the path, there's no distinction. So there really wasn't a distinction before we had the path, except that we didn't have the path. We were all lost. Now that a few others have the path, now those who have the path, there's no distinction because now we all have the path. And the path we get from the Buddha, but he wasn't the only pathmaker. But the building, the actual work, each one of us have to follow the plans. And not only that, but there's a lot of work to do in the sense of right effort. Never mind, start again. Never mind, start again. I know you're tired, pick up that lumber, get that hammer, tote that bale.

**Speaker C:** Sleeping house builders.

**Speaker A:** So thank you guys, I appreciate it. Anybody got any last one? Do you mean last question or? Yeah, does anybody have any last questions, anything left to say? Yeah, I would just like to ask.

**Speaker B:** How does Vipassana relate to practice of Anapanasati?

**Speaker A:** They're the same thing. How do you mean? In a non-sectarian way, Anapanasati means the Sati of mindfulness of the breathing, which means kind of watching what's going going on, and Vipassana, rather than looking at it as a doctrinal term, but look at what the word actually means, which means close looking, which is part of Anapanasati, look closely now, watch closely, that's what Vipassana is, and you can't look closely when the mind is scattered and unstable, so we need to get the mind stable, we need both Samatha and Vipassana. Okay, thank you. That's a short answer. I got a long one. We'll do some other time when you remind me. Good to see you, Luca. I see you on the internet from time to time on Skype, but I'm glad to see you on the call today.

**Speaker C:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** All right, folks, see you later.

**Speaker B:** See you. See everyone.

**Speaker A:** Okay, thank you.

**Speaker D:** Bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends, is a detailed commentary on the **"Mahāsīhanāda Sutta" (The Great Lion's Roar Sutta, MN 12)**. The central theme is a **demystified, non-literal, and practical interpretation** of the Buddha's so-called "powers," framing them as **attainable skills** rather than supernatural or psychic abilities.

Here is a structured summary of the key points:

### **Core Thesis**
The Buddha’s "lion’s roar" (his confident teaching authority) comes from **10 powers** that are **skills of insight and understanding**, not magical or psychic powers. These are presented as achievable through practice.

---

### **The 10 Powers (Explained Non-Magically)**
1. **Understanding the possible vs. impossible:**  
   Discernment of natural laws. *Example:* Lasting happiness is possible; levitation for show is not.

2. **Understanding karma’s results:**  
   Seeing cause and effect in actions (past, present, future) based on reality, not wishful thinking.

3. **Understanding where all paths lead:**  
   Discerning the outcomes of different practices (e.g., Goenka vs. Mahasi methods).

4. **Understanding the world’s diverse elements:**  
   Seeing the complexity and pervasive *dukkha* (suffering/stress) in existence.

5. **Understanding beings’ diverse convictions:**  
   Recognizing the vast range of views and beliefs people hold.

6. **Understanding others’ faculties/capacities:**  
   Not mind-reading, but understanding others’ mental patterns by understanding one’s own mind via *Paticcasamuppada* (dependent origination).

7. **Understanding corruption & purification in jhānas:**  
   Seeing hindrances, cleansing them, and emerging from *dukkha* through meditative attainments.

8. **Recollecting past “lives” (events):**  
   Interpreting “past lives” as **symbolic**—remembering one’s own past experiences, names, phases, and habits from this life (e.g., childhood memories). This is accessible through meditation (*ānāpānasati*).

9. **“Clairvoyance” of beings passing away/being reborn:**  
   Not literal rebirth, but **clear seeing** (*vipassanā*) of how people’s mental states change based on their actions. Seeing how greed/hatred lead to “hellish” states and generosity/goodwill lead to “heavenly” states **in this life**.

10. **Ending defilements & attaining liberation in this life:**  
    The culmination: achieving undefiled freedom of heart and wisdom **here and now**.

---

### **Key Interpretive Stances**
- **Anti-literal, anti-supernatural:** The sutta’s magical-sounding language (rebirth, clairvoyance, past lives) is **symbolic** or a result of **translator bias**. The true Dhamma is about **present-moment understanding and freedom**.
- **“In this very life” emphasis:** Liberation is achievable now, not in a future rebirth.
- **Karma as psychological cause/effect:** “Hell” and “heaven” are metaphors for mental states resulting from unskillful vs. skillful actions.
- **The Buddha’s authority comes from mastery of these 10 skills,** not supernatural distinction.

---

### **Additional Themes Discussed**
- **Fourfold Self-Assurance of the Buddha:** His fearlessness in teaching stems from his complete understanding and the efficacy of his path.
- **The “Eight Assemblies”:** With these skills, one can confidently engage any group (nobles, ascetics, gods, etc.) without fear.
- **Critique of blind faith and ritual:** The Buddha rejects purification through food, austerity, rebirth, or sacrifice—he had tried them all (“been there, done that”) and found them useless for liberation.
- **Importance of keeping the mind sharp** even in old age (contrary to the belief that wisdom must decline).
- **Warning about “Siddhis” (powers):** Pursuing supernatural powers for ego or gain is dangerous; true skill is used altruistically.
- **Dhamma is for the intellectually capable:** Not everyone can understand this non-magical, noble Dhamma; it’s for those who see *dukkha* as their own responsibility.

---

### **Practical Takeaways**
- **Practice goal:** Develop these 10 insights in your own life.
- **Method:** Use *ānāpānasati* (mindfulness of breathing) and *vipassanā* (close observation) to see things as they are.
- **Attitude:** Be fearless, confident, and altruistic as understanding grows.
- **Key sutta reference:** **MN 12, “The Great Lion’s Roar.”**

---

### **Conclusion**
The talk reframes the Buddha’s “powers” as **attainable skills of wisdom and insight**, emphasizing a **demystified, present-moment practice** that leads to freedom from suffering **in this very life**. It encourages practitioners to move beyond magical thinking and translator biases to grasp the practical, transformative core of the Dhamma.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on your transcript, the primary speaker (Speaker A, likely Dhammarato) uses several key metaphors and stories to explain the Buddha's "Ten Powers" and demystify the sutta, arguing against a literal, supernatural interpretation. Here are the main ones:

### **Core Metaphors**

1.  **The Lion's Roar & The Bull's Place:** This is the central metaphor of the sutta itself. It represents the **confidence, authority, and fearlessness** of the Buddha (or a practitioner) who has mastered these powers. He can enter any assembly (of kings, gods, scholars) and claim the rightful place of leadership ("the bull's place") and speak with undeniable authority ("roar the lion's roar").

2.  **Building a House / Following a Map:** The Dhamma is compared to **architectural plans or a map**. The teacher provides the blueprint, but **each person must build their own house** (achieve their own liberation). You can't hire a builder; you must "tote that bale" and "pick up that lumber" yourself through personal effort.

3.  **Watching the Hardware Store:** To explain the "clairvoyance" of seeing beings die and be reborn, the speaker offers a non-magical metaphor. Imagine watching people go into and out of a hardware store. The person who enters is not the same as the one who leaves—**their mental state has changed based on their experience inside**. Similarly, we can observe people's "comings and goings" through different mental states ("hells" and "heavens") in this life based on their actions (kamma).

4.  **The Collage of Photos / Video:** To explain how insight (vipassanā) works, even without supreme concentration, the mind is compared to assembling a **collage of photos or a video**. By patiently noting many individual moments (like taking many still photos), you can piece together a clear and accurate understanding, similar to the instantaneous clarity of deep jhāna.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Republican Claim of the Impossible:** Used as a modern, political example of people being unable to distinguish the possible from the impossible (the first of the Ten Powers). They are claiming something (a stolen election) that is, in the speaker's view, impossible, illustrating how this lack of wisdom creates suffering.

2.  **The Child Lying at the Door:** A simple story to illustrate reading behavior, not minds. A child says, "My mommy will be right back," while subtly nodding, begging the listener to believe the lie. The **incongruence between words and body language** reveals the truth. This shows the "power" of understanding others' faculties is about keen observation, not psychic ability.

3.  **The Buddha's Extreme Asceticism:** Referencing the story found in other suttas (MN 36, MN 12), the speaker recounts how the Buddha practiced severe self-mortification (eating so little his belly touched his backbone) and **found it didn't work**. This story is used to demonstrate that the Buddha's authority comes from having tried and rejected the wrong paths, thus truly knowing the correct one.

4.  **"Been there, done that":** This is presented as the Buddha's attitude (and one practitioners should develop) toward various speculative religious doctrines of his time (purity from food, sacrifices, fire rituals, etc.). The Buddha's "power" is his experiential knowledge that these paths don't lead to liberation. The speaker encourages a similar discernment toward modern spiritual fads.

5.  **The 100-Year-Old Disciples & The Archer:** In the sutta, the Buddha says even if he had four perfect disciples who lived for 100 years and questioned him incessantly, his Dhamma and wisdom would not run out. The speed of their understanding is compared to **a skilled archer shooting an arrow through the shadow of a palm tree**. The speaker uses this to emphasize that **true wisdom does not deteriorate with age** if you "keep your mind sharp."

### **Key Symbolic Reinterpretations**
The speaker consistently reinterprets traditional terms metaphorically:
*   **"Rebirth" (in hells/heavens):** Symbolizes the **immediate change in mental state** following good or bad actions (e.g., guilt is a "hell," gratitude is a "heaven").
*   **"Deva" (god):** Can refer to **deluded humans who think they are gods**, like celebrities or arrogant rulers.
*   **"Recollecting past lives":** Can mean **recalling our own rich personal history** from childhood onward, understanding the patterns that made us who we are.
*   **"Breaking up of the body" (kāyassa bhedā):** Could be reinterpreted as the **breaking up of a mental state** or identity, not physical death.

**Overall Purpose:** All these metaphors and stories serve the speaker's main argument: the Buddha's powers are **non-magical, humanly attainable skills of wisdom and perception** that lead to fearlessness and liberation *in this very life*. They are a "map" for becoming your own authority ("the lion") by seeing reality clearly.
