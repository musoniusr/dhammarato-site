### Transcript


**Speaker A:** About Divended Origination or Paticcasamuppada. And Daniel, I'm always happy to talk about this, especially because so many people have made basic mistakes. And part of the reason why the mistakes are made is because, first off, The language, or the translations of the language, is wrong, and the language itself is somewhat stilted. But it's because of the way that people understood things 2,500 years ago, and we understand things a little more sophisticated now. But that kind of leads us to the confusion about what the actual teachings of the Buddha were. So let's look at that in the order, starting from the beginning, is ignorance. And that how we use that term for best understanding is to understand that we started out as a child in great ignorance. Every child is completely stupid. Not one baby under the age of one month could possibly score anything on an IQ test. Their IQ would be zero, right? We're all— we all start out that way. And so this is the point about the ignorance, is that the ignorance is the foundation for how we learn things, or how we put things together, or how we accumulate things, which is the Samskara. Is that we build up stuff over time, and we do so with a mixture of ignorance. And so everything that a little child learns, they don't learn it the way that an adult would. We learn things as children by either in the beginning accepting, which would be the oral phase, and then the terrible twos is the child gets to the point point that now he's rejecting everything. He's trying to establish himself. This is the, uh, they call it the terrible twos because the child learns the word no, and Mommy doesn't like the baby saying no to Mommy. So when we understand that, um, ignorance is what we build our memory systems on, that there are huge holes in our memory systems. There's many, many different ways that I can show you that. An easy way would be for you to think about your favorite movie, or just any movie, okay? A movie that you've probably seen more than one time, a movie that you've mulled over in your mind later after you watch the movie. Okay, so now that we've got a movie established in the mind, do you know every line of the dialogue in that entire movie? Do you know every song that was played in that movie and who wrote it? Because all that information is in the back of the, uh, uh, the movie. We probably didn't take that information in. Okay, now the laptop actually has a much better memory because they not only remember every dialogue piece, the computer also remembers every pixel frame by frame by frame. If the computer picks it up and the computer is functioning correctly, then it can play that movie back totally. But you could not recall or play back a whole movie in your mind. You just can't do it, okay? The memory systems that we have are shoddy, except for one thing: the human memory system is far superior than animal memories. Animals don't remember much. Humans remember quite a bit. So I would say that offhand, you could say that animals, depending upon which animals are species would remember maybe 1 or 2% of what's happening to them throughout their lives, and humans will remember 3 or 4%. So that's double the amount, maybe triple the amount that an animal can learn. But the amount that we lose— and we lose information coming in, we lose information in the way that it's stored, and we lose information in the way that memory comes out. In other words, we actually construct memory. On many occasions, Madeline Albright is a very, very clear example of this. She's one of my favorites. She was the Secretary of State, or no, the Attorney General of the United States during the Clinton administration. And there was a huge scandal with Madeline Albright, because before she had been the Attorney General, she was the big head DA, District Attorney, in Miami. And that a few years after she left that post, a whole lot of women started putting things together. They got in communication with each other and found out that they had all been lied to. And this is what the lies were, was that each one of these women put a brother or an uncle, or a teacher, or someone in jail for rape, because they were raped when they were children; except that as adults, they go back and they recognize that they were tricked into claiming that they were raped, and that they actually weren't. But as children, they constructed those memories. The social workers, in other words, Madeline Albright, wanted so badly to get a whole bunch of convictions. That the police, the prosecutors, and especially the social workers and the psychologists working with these girls put memories in those girls' minds. And then they remembered, and then later they recognized that it wasn't true, that they had put Uncle Bob in jail for no reason at all, and they were greatly remorseful It was a huge deal that this came out. I guess all of you are not old enough, maybe Tim will remember this happened in the 1990s. I mean, it was a big, big issue. About a dozen girls or more accused a family member of rape, and they were prosecuted and jailed. And the rapes didn't happen, except in the minds of the girls. And those rapes got into the minds of the girls. Girls because they were convinced. Now that is what we're talking about, is ignorance. That we remember things that don't happen. We sometimes can't tell the difference between a dream and a reality. Another one is, is that you have a great big beautiful thought that's in the middle of people, and they're talking and you're talking and you share this big thought, and then later you find out from one of them, you didn't tell us that. You thought about it, you intended to tell us, but you didn't tell us, but you remember telling us. Okay, this is what memory is really all about. It's pretty shoddy. The Samskara is a bunch of old past stuff that's of not much value, and it's the Samskara and the ignorance leads to the Samskara buildup, and that is, let us say, going to sit there for a minute. And now let's go to consciousness. Consciousness actually is in ways a kind of a Samskara also, in the sense that the eyes are part of the body, and the body is made up of compounded things. And so it's almost kind of a play on words in the Pali, that the body, and in fact it talks about it in Sutra 9 that Robert and I are going to do someday, where the Samskara is listed as 3 kinds of Samskara. One is the bodily Samskara, which will give rise to our senses. And then there is verbal Samskara, which is actually all of the stuff that we were told and remember, all of the rules. All of the ways that things should be done. Do your homework, clean your room, doing all the things you were told to do. And then the third is the Citta Sankhara, which is actually the emotional memory, or our hearts. And all of these have compounded things, or stuff that's added to. When that natural 'I' then sees a natural event with the 'I', that would be an 'I consciousness'. Now to be honest with you, the word consciousness in English has two different definitions, and so right now I'm just introducing it with just one definition. And the one definition is sensory input is a kind of consciousness. We are conscious of, for instance, when the siren howls, you can hear it, and you become conscious of it. You can actually be conscious of the chair that you're sitting in, because you can feel the chair on your hips, on your legs, on your back. You can actually experience that chair, you can be conscious that the chair is there. And if the chair was ripped out from under you all of a sudden, you would be conscious of that too. Before you hit the ground, you would be conscious that the chair had been moved. So this is the sensory input. Now what we do with that sensory input is try to understand it. And the understanding then, the process of understanding, is what is called perception. In the Pali, it's referred to both as perception in the sense of Pañña, but in the Paticcasamuppada, it's used and referenced as Namarupa. Namarupa means that the Rupa is there, the reality of what we saw. The chair that we're sitting on, or the sight that we saw with the eyes, is a Rupa, it's a physical object. Is real. The sound that comes to the ear. Now, the voice may be telling a lie, but the sound of that lie is real. And so, we take the reality, the rupa, and we try to understand it through the process of perception. And this is where the Samskaras come back in. They come in at the perception So that we use our past in order to understand the present. Otherwise, it's just raw data. That in fact, a very, very tender infant only takes raw data; they don't do much processing, because they don't have a memory system built up at all. But over time, over a short period of time in fact, the child will learn how to maneuver his hands. A very, very tender infant of less than 2 days, 3 days old cannot even manipulate their hands. They can see a mobile above their eyes, and they will swing their hands around to try to play with the mobile. And they keep doing that, and pretty soon they'll start making the connections of how to actually grab it. And so this is something that we do as a tender infant. With a mobile right in front of us, and then later as an adult, we do that same thing when a new mobile or a new piece of information is presented to us. We try to grab a hold of it, we try to make sense out of it, we try to perceive it or to understand it. And by understanding it, that means that we have to place it in context. And the context is our memory system, which we have already defined as shoddy. And so when we actually understand something or bring it about that we've got it, then there is a new kind of consciousness, and the Pali for that one is the Saleyatana. Now the 'atana' are the sense organs, and the Saleyatana are the internal sense organs. That in fact, whenever we think up something, we have to think it up in sight, sound, touch, all of those kinds of things that we have as sensory input. There are some kinds of sensory inputs that are available to some animals, but humans don't have it. An example of that is odors for a dog. Odors are a major part of the way that dogs live, but for humans, odors are not important. Another example would be honeybees who are collecting nectar from flowers. They go, and by getting the nectar from the flowers, they touch the flower, they buzz around it, they spread pollen or whatever like that, and that changes the colors of that flower. But it does at the infrared level. And so because humans can't see it, you can look at a field of flowers and you won't know which flower has been nectarized or picked by the bees, but a bee can fly over that patch of flowers and know immediately that flower has not been harvested and all the others have, because they can see them. This is what we mean by the salyakhtinī, is that the bees have a sensory input and they have a memory system for that, and they can understand things and put it together in a way that humans cannot. So, we actually now have two kinds of consciousness, and both in the Pali and in English, we use the word consciousness, or in the Pali, the word is Vinaya, and we use it in two ways. One is the actual sight that comes in, 'I see.' And then the other kind of consciousness would be referred to as 'I see what you mean.' 'I see what you mean.' And when we say 'I see what you mean,' that's an understanding, as opposed to just 'I see something and I don't understand it because I don't have any input to reference it with.' So, we have now talked about ignorance, Sankhara, Vinaya, Sangha, or Namarupa, and Salyatana. And that Salyatana, or that kind of consciousness, or that kind of knowing, is what impacts us. The actual scene did not impact us. Let us say that you have two people that are standing in the road, and both of them see someone across the street, and based upon the way that he is dressed— let's just say it like that— the way that this guy is dressed, these two people have a completely different reaction to him. They saw physically the same thing, but what they saw in their mind was completely different. And they had different reactions to it. An example of that would be someone in a nun's habit, and that one of the people that saw her was a student in a Catholic school where he got beat by nuns. The other one is a seminary student who is about to be ordained as a priest. Those two people, when they see the nun, are going to have completely different reactions to them based upon their past. And so our past always influences, not influences the input of the present moment, but it does influence what we do with that information in the present moment. And it's that information that contacts us. The actual site, the actual nun's habit did not contact those guys. That was just a sight contact. What really contacted them was what they did with it on the inside based upon their past. Okay, so let's stop there for a moment. Uh, Robert, you got your hand up.

**Speaker B:** Yep, as usual. So, um, so, uh, One criticism I've read of AI is that it basically makes decisions only through processing choices and decisions that have already been made, and thus it precludes any opportunity for originality. You know, like an example of that is that Netflix uses AI to design and come up with ideas for its new TV shows, so they keep creating kind of rehashes of the same old stories, and people are getting kind of tired of it. But the algorithm has determined that those are the most effective stories at gaining viewers. So some people say that right now we live in an age with a death of originality because AI is creating all the content and AI only knows how to pick from the past. But humans seem to be able to be more imaginative than simply picking from the past. I'm curious to hear your thoughts on that.

**Speaker A:** Well, okay, yes, creativity. Is a little bit different than recognition. That what we're talking about here is recognition of something that is almost always based upon the past. Now, let us say that there are three now, the AI machine and these two guys see someone coming down the street. Okay. And each one of them is going to do something different. But the AI is only going to do stuff based upon its own knowledge base, which may be nothing but just millions of photos, which may or may not have a nun's habit in there. The other two guys are going to do something with that information, and it may be creative. That in fact one of the possibilities that the AI is not going to do would be what that guy that had nuns as teachers. He just happens to have a yardstick or a ruler in his backpack, and he charges right up to that nun, grabs her palm of her hand, and spanks it with that ruler because that's what happened to him from nuns. Okay, that was his creative response. So in that sense of creative response, humans have a whole lot more information, at least this year, than any AI machine. But there may come a time, you see, when AI is let us say, put into robots, and they go out into the world and just collect data randomly. What then? Will the AI machine take a ruler and spank a nun's hand? Probably not, because he was not in her class, getting his hand spanked. So the point is that we cannot yet compare human creativity with AI creativity, because AI is still in its infancy, and we don't know what's going to happen in the future. I did have a long conversation with Eno on this, because it was part of the coursework that he was doing to get his degree in philosophy, where the question is not, will AI turn nasty on its own, but rather, the AI will operate based upon the information that it's fed, and so the humans will be feeding the information to the AI. And so Vladimir Putin would do different things with AI than Aunt Susie would do with AI. In other words, it has to do with the intent. That's one of the things that we can understand. And right now, we don't have AI sophisticated enough for it to really have much intent, or greed and ill will, that they're not programming that into the AI. The other thing about AI is that it requires energy, it requires power, and that almost always that power is going to, let us say, be temporary. It is going to be in batteries or something like that. But you could say that I would perhaps be more afraid of a great big giant Neanderthal with a club who is chasing me, than a robot chasing me, because all I have to do is figure out where the off switch is on the robot. Where the big Neanderthal He doesn't have that same kind of off switch that we can find. Maybe the only thing, the off switch that he has, is club him in the head, but where the AI is going to be electrical, and electrical engineers will always go looking for where the electrical power goes. So, I wouldn't worry too much about AI, because right now we don't have any AI in our class, or our group here. That what we have to do is consider what would a human do, because the humans are both much more sophisticated than the AI in general, but we're not as technically sophisticated in a particular area like facial recognition. I mean, humans are very good at facial recognition. You recognize people by their faces all the time. And that in fact, you can see the picture of an old, old lady and see a picture of her when she was in her 20s, and you can see the resemblance. Yes, this is the same person, right? But we have not— each individual one of us has not actually analyzed millions and millions of photos, and so we're not nearly as good at facial recognition as the AI. Would be. Anybody volunteer to go look at a million photos so that you can figure out how to do facial recognition? No, you did facial recognition offhand as an infant. An infant knows the difference between a stranger and a mother. And so, um, we have gotten our own kind of ways of of processing data that's different. So anyway, there's not a whole lot to say about AI, because AI is not the issue. What is the issue is, can we reprocess or undo some of the ignorance that we picked up when we were really little. When we were young kids in school, we made decisions that were based in ignorance. We didn't have the kind of processing that we needed, but we made that decision, we put it into our grab bag of tricks, and now we're using that information and using that skill as an adult, ineffectively. Because it was based on ignorance in the first place. And that's what contacts us, is the fact that everything that we know is polluted with our past. So the question is, are you going to pollute things now in this present moment with recent past or really, really old past? In other words, we're saying that we can in fact start putting some useful, valuable, wholesome, non-ignorant new information into our kit bag, and then start processing using that data, rather than using the old, old stuff that is not effective. An example of that: the meditator, when he first starts practicing meditation, and the mind wanders away, the first thing that will happen is, "Oh no, the mind wandered away, this is hard." Well, that's the way that he thought when he was a child. Many students will continue to do that when the mind wanders away from their object of meditation: "Oh, this is hard. Oh, I can't do it. Oh, I don't know what the problem is," over and over and over again because they're still using that old data even though they have been— it's been proven to them that they can change their mind. That's why I use the example of red and green. Everybody think about the color red for a moment. Get it in your mind to understand, you know what red is. And now think of green. Understand what green is. And the point about this little exercise is to recognize that you can change your mind from red to green, that we need to practice to know that over and over again, that you can change, that we don't have to get stuck with this old AI, or this old programming rather, and that we can add some new wholesome data. And then when we process something, we process it with something some new data. So, um, the whole point then is to understand that it's this processed data that contacts us, and that if we start having new memories of wholesome success, then that will pile on to the old failures from the past and outweigh them, or cover them over, so that in later times when we process data, we'll be processing it based upon better data from better process recently, and come up with a better solution. So basically what that means is that in the old days, when X would happen, I would always feel Y. But now when X happens, I don't have to feel Y, I can feel Z. And I have to make that effort to change the Y to a Z. And when X happens again, now it's going to be easier to do Z rather than the old way of doing Y. And I keep practicing doing Z over and over again so the next time when X happens, Z will pop up rather than the Y. And so this is how we practice. We want to practice over and over and over again to develop the skill of doing things in the moment, rather than lazily just assuming it's like it was in the past, like when we were in diapers, and start processing data in the present moment. So, this is the way that we can understand this early part of Paticcasamuppada. Another way of understanding it, which is an important point, is to understand that so far in this sequence of Paticcasamuppada, we've been talking about actually the Five Aggregates. What are the Five Aggregates? The body, which we've mentioned. We've also mentioned, not quite yet, but we're about to start talking about feelings. And then we've already talked about consciousness and perception and the memory system or the Samskara. Now, the body is not who I am. The body has changed over time. That in fact there was a time when the leg was broken. But it wasn't me that was broken, it was just a leg that was broken. And one of the things that we do in our society is we ignorantly assume that I am the body, that if I can make the body more beautiful, then I am more beautiful. This gives rise to the cosmetic industry. People thinking that, "I am not good enough, so let me paint the body, make the body beautiful, and then I will be beautiful," because they attach to the body. We also attach to our knowledge, we attach to our consciousness, we attach to our feelings. In fact, we attach mostly to our feelings, in the sense of the language we use, Like, I am frustrated, I am sad, I am angry, I'm happy today. In the sense that the feeling, whatever it is, I become that. And what we are actually beginning now to practice is to see through direct observation that I am not the body. I can't control it.. It's going to grow old. It doesn't grow young because I want it to. It does not get thin and then fat when I want it to. You can't change the age of the body. You can't want to be 70 and then the body is 70 years old. We do not have that kind of control over the body. It does not actually belong to this thing called me, that at best I'm a guest in this house. And I'm not it, I do not own it. Well, if I am not the feelings, and I am not the body, and I am not my memory systems, I'm not who I was in the past, I am not this process that we're calling perception, and I am not that sensory input, in other words, I'm not any of these 5 Sankhara aggregates then where does the self come from? The answer is that it comes out of ignorance later. So there's another kind of ignorance that happens, and that's the ignorance of this present moment that's based upon the ignorance of the past. So one of the things that we pop into this Salyatana One of the things that we process into it with our perception is more ignorance. In other words, we got it wrong when we put it in, we've got it wrong when it comes out, and now we're feeling, we're contacted by and have feelings about how we got it wrong. And so when our feelings are now ignorant, this is where the real teaching of the Second Noble Truth pops into play. Place, and that is that it is ignorance or delusion that takes the greed and the ill will, or the liking and not liking, and turns the liking into wanting, grasping, and clinging due to ignorance, and the not liking changes into hatred, destruction, wanting to get rid of it, demanding that we get rid of it, etc. Like that. So this is where the second part of the teaching of Paticcasamuppada comes up, and that is that it's the ignorance that we start with now is mixed into the ignorance of this moment, so that we are unwise when we have that feeling that arises upon that contact. Okay, I'm actually using the word contact over and over again because that's the Pali word is pa����ha, and the samyātana is what contacts us, and the contact then is what creates our feelings, and the feelings are more than likely going to be ignorant because we have ignorance built into it from the Sankhara. This is what makes psychotherapy a little bit complicated, is because we don't understand this process. But when we begin to understand this process about how we keep bringing ignorance back in because we're using it out of the past, then we can start processing with more current, up-to-date, more likely correct, non-ignorant information. This is what Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about wisdom at the point of contact. That the sallyatana that we come up with may or may not be correct. We have to understand that we may not be correct with our assumptions or our made-up new information, and it would be better, rather than jumping on the bandwagon of 'I don't like it' or 'I like it,' is to go back to the consciousness and gather more information. This is the trick, is that once we get information, we want to jump to a conclusion, where a better thing to do would be to go get more information and more information, so that we can do a better job of processing it, to come up with something that's more correct. So wisdom at the point of contact means that we are wise now to how we feel. If I like something, then I know that that's all there is, is that I like it. Okay, let's say that there is a female that has on makeup. She has put on the makeup to become what she calls attractive, which means that She wants it to be attractive to men. So the man then sees the girl, but he doesn't see the girl as the actual girl; he sees the girl as she's presenting herself, including all of the makeup, which you could also think of as part of the Samskara. In other words, you can see by the makeup that she is making the statement, "I am the body," But we don't make that connection often. We just say, ah, beautiful girl, I want it, I want it, I want it, I gotta have it. Oh, let me have her phone number. Oh, let me get in contact with her. Oh, I gotta go see her. Okay, why is that? Is because that's the old way that we processed. I like it, therefore I want it. But if we do this wisely, then when we like something, then we can know, oh, I like it, but that's enough. But in fact, there's a really beautiful story about Ajahn Chah and Ajahn Sumedho. They were at a festival where all of the young women were dressed up, all the Thai girls were in their best costumes, not necessarily sexual, just well done. And Ajahn Chah asked Sumedho, "Well, what do you think?" Anicca and Samatha, having been to Wat Soi Milk and understood the Buddhist teaching discussion, he knew that this was a trick question, and his answer was brilliant. He says, "I like it, but I don't want it." Now that's wisdom at the point of contact. I like it, but I don't want it, because if I want it, now I'm going to be in.

**Speaker C:** Danger.

**Speaker A:** It would be uncool for Samatha to get off of the monk's dais, or wherever he was sitting at that time, and go start chatting up the girls. And so he recognizes that that's a little bit dangerous. I don't really want to go chat up the girls. It's just better that I just see it and like it. Yes, Robert.

**Speaker B:** I'm just curious, does that happen very often in Thailand where the monks will.

**Speaker A:** Go and talk to the ladies? Absolutely.

**Speaker C:** Not.

**Speaker A:** I would imagine, yeah. No, that monks don't touch people, not even each other, and monks do not initiate conversations with lay people. Except in special circumstances, in the sense that, well, the person came to the wat for the Dhamma talk, and so they initiated it kind of anyway. But the young girls who were coming to the wat all dolled up, they're not there to initiate, um, uh, a whoop-de-doo with, with a monk. All right, and so if the monk goes to approach them, that's a.

**Speaker C:** Problem.

**Speaker A:** Um, here's one. There's— this is actually something that I still practice. I learned this the hard way over and over again, and that is, imagine that you're at the Wat and it is crowded with people, and the women are in the kitchen, and the whole pack of them there, they're within inches of each other if they're not actually touching. And the bathroom is on the other side of the kitchen, and the monk wants to go to the bathroom. How does he get to the bathroom? The answer is that he stands and he waits, hoping, and probably, that one of the Asian women there will know exactly what's going on, and she will be the one who moves the other women out of the way. In fact, it was in one one case that the women were sitting in the hallway. The whole hall was filled with women sitting on the floor. You could not get to the bathroom without touching every one of them because of the way that they were sitting. All right, and so the monk has to just stand there and wait until they get the idea that he's about to cramp in his robe and he needs for you to get up get out of the way. But that's part of the training, that in the beginning the young monk would think so badly he had to get to the bathroom, that getting to the bathroom was the important thing, and it didn't matter how many people he touched or went by. But as he practices and Anagami comes to understand the rules, we'll just let the lay people move out of the way for us. Now fast forward to present time, I still do that. Even for the dogs, if the dog is standing in the way, I'll wait. Or if a human is standing in the way, if daughter is standing in the doorway, I'll just stand there waiting for her to move. Is actually a good practice, rather than, oh, I want this, I'm going to go there, and I'll go do whatever I need to do, step on whoever I need to step on, brush by the people, whoever they are, because I got to get to the toilet, right? So we begin to change that mentality, is that I'm only going to go to the toilet when it is a free passage. To get there. And so we don't move things around. So that's the answer to your question at a fairly detailed level, that no, monks do not initiate. They don't initiate, they just hang back. It's actually quite a lot of freedom to do it that way. You'd be surprised at what power I mean, any of you guys, if you walked into that similar situation, you couldn't get 50 women to move for you. You would have to go wind your way through them. But a monk, he comes and stands, and 50 people are going to start moving out of the way to give him passage. Now that's power.

**Speaker B:** Do you think part of the benefit of the Vinaya is to provide plenty of opportunities to sharpen one's Sati? Because there are so many rules like this, and I would imagine it's actually kind of beneficial in the sense that.

**Speaker A:** They would keep you remembering and waking up. Absolutely. If you never hear about it, then we're going to ignore it completely. But if you understand, here's an example of that: malicious gossip is actually put out in the Vinaya as that one monk does not talk to a second monk about a third monk, with the understanding of trashing him or separating them as friends. And at the highest level, That would be called a Sangha de Sesa, that the monks don't talk to each other about breaking the Sangha. They don't cause divisions. That rule right there that I just mentioned is the reason why the Sangha is still 2,500 years old, still in existence, with millions of participants at any particular time, any decade, For the past 2,500 years, there have been thousands to millions of people part of the Sangha because of this one rule: You don't trash others. And that is one of the most difficult rules for Westerners, because we go around trashing everybody and everything. We will join a political party just to trash the other party. We'll join this religion just to trash that religion. We'll become a patriot of this country just so that we can trash that other country over there. So this whole idea of— hello, Scott. This whole idea then about malicious gossip is a very, very valuable rule, but I can't give you guys rules That's not my business. In fact, I would like for you to understand that rules like malicious gossip— the Buddha talks about this, but malicious gossip actually goes back to my favorite sutta, number 117, the Great Forty, where he's talking about that malicious gossip is the wrong, false speech that we will engage in when the mind is not noble. So if you want to trash somebody or put them down or anything like that, either in emails or in talking or in questions or even in your mind when you're saying, oh, that dude wrote a book and now he's in the red light district, he must be a terrible human being, you know, that's the kind of language that we would have. And then we wake up to that and recognizing, "Oh, that's only pollution in my own mind. I don't really know the situation. All I know is the hearsay that I have picked up. Why did I even bother to pick up that hearsay, and worse still, why am I repeating it?" Let's stay with the facts. Let's stay with reality. And the reality is, is that we don't know what happened let's leave it that way rather than inventing something or making something up, which is what we're prone to do. We make up stuff all the time and think it's true, especially if we were told that it's true by somebody else who also made it up in their mind. So when you got a whole bunch of people that make up the same story, they're more than likely all going to believe it. And so, uh, this is what malicious gossip is really all about. Is, uh, gossiping is just talking about another person. Malicious is when we're talking about it in the sense of that I want you to not go to that Dharma teaching because he's been in the red light district. Okay, that's kind of a separation. We're trying to divide you up. That's the Sangha dissession, the breaking of the Sangha. And we want to keep the Sangha together. It's ordinary minds that want to divide to conquer, and we're here going to unify to conquer. And so that's the point about the malicious gossip, and it's in the Vinaya, but it's also in the sutta from the perspective of how the mind works. And so now you can take the rule from the Vinaya that one must does not talk about a third monk to a second monk in a disparaging way. We also do not tell direct lies. Why? Because if we're telling a direct lie, that means that we're wanting to hide some bad behavior, or we're wanting to get something. And so, if we start recognizing that those rules that the monks have are actually training They're training rules. But in fact, that's what the word precept really means, that this is a training rule. It's not an actual rule. And so, um, it's better to say unfortunate that so many magically oriented people will say, oh, the Kamma machine will come get you if you kill somebody. You will have to get sometime in the future. Actually, the reality is that if you kill someone, you will kill yourself over and over and over again in your own mind, because of the bad state that we were in when we harmed someone. And so, the precepts are actually there to help foster wisdom. So that we don't have to go kill people to figure out what a stupid thing that is to do, that we can work off the wisdom of others. And the wisdom of the Buddha would point out that if you don't want anything, then you're unlikely to go kill anybody. So it's much better for you to get your mind into a state of not wanting anything rather than just merely abstaining from killing someone, or how badly you want to kill him, is to recognize you want to kill him, and that that's the problem, is your desire. Your desire is based upon ignorance. And so this is the teaching of the Paticcasamuppada, is to recognize— and we can use these rules as training rules or training exercises. So Robert, you still got your.

**Speaker B:** Hand up? Yeah, you know, as you were mentioning the clinging to an identification with various traditions and religions, it made me think that the reason people do cling to traditions, religions, etc., is such that they can craft an identity more often than not, rather than actually investigating the ideals of whatever organization or religion it is they belong to. And so could you say then that the identification or the desire to identify with groups is kind of an error of personality view? You know, that's really what it resides in.

**Speaker A:** Like, where do you think that comes from? Yes, that's exactly right, that when we have the personality view that I have a personality, that I'm a let us say, not everlasting, but not very temporary; that it's in fact persistent, let's say, over a lifetime, that I'm the same person over many years, is the delusion that we have. And that gives rise to the personality view. That the main teachings of the Buddha— a lot of people misunderstand what that personality view is all about. The real teachings of that personality view, which is by the way the first Vedana, is to understand that you can change, that you are not fixed, you are not a particular personality. The Johnny Depp that made the first movie is not the Johnny Depp that's in court recently. And we make a major mistake when we think that it's the same guy. But we make that same mistake with ourselves, that think not only things can change, they do change. And if we understand that things are changing, now we have the option of guiding that change And that's when we begin to change our personality, is because we can change it and we recognize that we can change the personality, that I'm not what I was yesterday. Yesterday I was the one who wanted to have those 4 hard drives backed up. Today I'm the guy who is pleased that those 4 hard drives are backed up. Not the same dude, right? If we can understand that we are changing constantly, then that personality view kind of falls apart in a way that if I kill someone and then later I'm going to be punished, the person who is getting punished is not the person who actually committed the crime. And yet our government requires that. It requires that, oh, we got to punish the guy who did that, to where in fact the guy who did it did it out of anger, and now he's all remorseful. And you think that it's the same guy. It's not the same. We keep changing that. Everything is constantly in flux. Everything is changing based upon things that contact us and the way that they contact us. And so sometimes we like it, sometimes we don't. Or as you've heard me say, sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't. We're just constantly in a process of change. If we wake up to that, then we can guide that change. And so this is the real teaching of Paticcasamuppada, is just because I like it doesn't mean that I have to have it. Let's have some wisdom at that point and recognize it all. That's going to be dangerous to have that one. Let me just appreciate it. Let me just like it without having to have it. Or I can endure this. I don't have to get rid of it. That, yeah, I can have a little bursitis in the elbow, or let's say some back pain. I don't have to go get surgery for it. I don't have to get rid of it. I don't have to go take pain pills. I can in fact handle pain. I know how to do it. I learned it to go anchor retreats. And I may not like pain, but I know that I can handle it. And so that's that wisdom at the point of contact, so that when I don't like that pain, that doesn't mean that I have to go do something about it. One of the things that I could do, and in fact is enjoy how intense it is and really investigate and experience it, knowing that I don't like it. But normally when we don't like something, we try to push it away. We don't want to know it. We don't want to have any experience with it. But when we are practicing well, practicing correctly, then even though we don't like something, doesn't mean that we have to get rid of it. We can investigate it instead. So does anybody else have any questions? We turn your.

**Speaker C:** Mic on. Um, I was I just thought of, so the thing you just said.

**Speaker A:** About.

**Speaker C:** Pain, wouldn't that be a hindrance to like be experiencing pain? Or like, how would you be able to experience Piti and Sukkha if you're experiencing like physical pain, for example? Like, wouldn't it be more wise to try to, I don't know, adjust yourself or something if you're experiencing that pain? Because I know like when I first started meditating, like I would be convinced that you have to sit and then you can't move at all. And have a perfectly straight back and sit perfectly like that. And then I would just— it would just be like a— I would just be sitting there in discomfort and hindrance the whole time without experiencing any.

**Speaker A:** So precisely so, right? Difference. Well, what's— what you're talking about there is actually the very Western mentality. In fact, That's Christianity. That's flagellating yourself. And the idea of flagellation, that in fact the Buddha got into that, and this came from the Jains, and the teaching is that, "Oh, I can in fact handle this present moment." 'Because I am good in this present moment, I am not causing any bad Kamma to happen right now, but all I have left is the old Kamma that needs to be burned off. Let me go ahead and now start flagellating myself, hurting myself, starving myself, or sitting in a stupid posture and bring pain on, because that will take care of the old bad Kamma, and then I will live freely without any pain. Right? That's the mentality. The Buddha tried that, and he found out it don't work. That in fact, the new behavior of causing the new pain in the present moment does not alleviate old Kamma. It's new Kamma, it's new painful Kamma that you're doing. Okay? So, from that perspective, we can recognize that some pain comes from something that we don't have any control over at all, and some pain comes from our behavior. And if we change our behavior, we can eliminate the pain. An example of that is a broken arm. If you put it into a cast, and it can heal, but it's got to be a good fast. One of the problems with the, uh, with teenagers— teenagers will often break the forearm bone, one or the other of them, and they'll put a cast on, and the cast then allows their fingers to continue to move so that they can use their hand. That's an absolute disaster, because while they're moving their hand, they're moving all of those muscles in there, and it prevents the bone from healing. If they really— if the doctors were really going to do it correctly for the dude, they would put a hand plaster down so that he can't use his hands. He could move them and touch them and whatnot, but he wouldn't be able to grasp and grab a hold of things because it's the grabbing that causes the pain. All right, so that's one of the— an example of something that we can do. Now that the arm is broken, we can go back to the point in time of how the arm got broken, because we can say that either that was in his control—he did something really stupid—or it was not in his control—it happened and he didn't have any control over it. So we have to make that distinction of what is this something—is this pain that I'm doing right now, In other words, not the breaking of the arm, but letting the arm heal, because if I use my hands a lot, it'll hurt a lot. So, I have to stop using my hands in order to let the arm heal. As you can tell, this is direct experience. I've done this, been there, done that one. All right, and so we have to understand then that many of the pains that we have can be alleviated with our behavior, and then some pains cannot be alleviated through our behavior, other than how are we going to respond to the pain itself. And one of the ways that we can respond to the pain is by doing whatever we need to alleviate it. For instance, people who are sitting a long time in meditation and their legs hurt, the legs are actually giving them information saying, 'Hey, the circulation has stopped,' or 'There's too much pressure on this leg at this particular time, you need to move.' The leg is telling you that it's uncomfortable and it's an ouchie, and that if you don't move, you can in fact possibly do damage. In fact, I know 5 guys I can name some of them off to you because you don't know them. One was a German monk at, uh, uh, what's the name of the place? Oh, Wat Mahathat. Another one is a monk named Vila Maramsi, which you've heard. Another one is Ajahn Brahm. Another one was Bhikkhuni. These guys forced themselves to sit according to the Anicca and the Mahayana method, to the point that now they can't sit at all. In fact, there's a subbato that's living now in Malaysia that was at Wat Soan Mokkhun. He left here because he could not sit with the monks and he was embarrassed. He needs to be around a place where there are few monks because he can't sit with the monks because the pain in his legs are too much. That's a real clue right there that it is possible that you can damage your legs by forcing yourself to sit too long. Don't do that. That in fact, if you understand the real teaching of the Buddha, the Sukkha is part of the training that we're doing to train the mind to come out of Dukkha into Sukkha. And you can't do that when the body's in pain. So you have to find a way of getting the body comfortable. So let us say then that here you are sitting, you've only been sitting for a minute or two, and a mosquito bites. The easy thing to do would be to get an ointment and to salve that wound, and then come back and pay attention to the mind and continue going. But what a lot of people will do, especially the Mahasi, is that they'll say, never mind, I'm just going to sit here And now the itching starts and they can't stand the itching. They didn't do anything about it, and all of a sudden, without them even knowing it, they're scratching. And then, wait a minute, I was not going to move. All right, so the whole problem with this, uh, Western mentality of meditation is that we have to endure painful things that we don't need to endure, but I would not recommend that that would be a practice. There is going to be enough reality of things that you don't like and will have to endure anyway. Let that be your meditation practice right then and there. So if you break your arm, then let your hand be your main meditation. You're not going to be grasping and clinging to things with your hand because you want the leg to heal— or excuse me, the arm to heal. If you've got a broken leg, don't walk around on crutches and using that leg even though it's in a cast. That's going to slow down the healing. You need to sit down and let that leg heal. And so this is how we can tell the difference then, is that much of the pain that we have is not self-inflicted, but there's going to be pains. The question then is how we're going to deal with those, and it's the same way that we're going to deal with not giving ourselves pain unnecessarily. Right. Okay, I would strongly recommend you sit in comfort rather than sitting in pain for a.

**Speaker C:** Long time.

**Speaker A:** Robert, Robert, go ahead. Yeah, Robert's got a question. Are you on.

**Speaker D:** Robert? Yes. So I was talking with someone earlier this week and they advised me to have no goals. And I've sort of taken that advice and run with it, and I've had really good results. But I've noticed that a lot of— and I've started to notice that a lot of goals and desires and cravings really interfere with my interpersonal relationships. But it's so— it feels so difficult to let go of certain goals, like the goal of having like a loving relationship, for example, I can see can actually be detrimental to like my just normal relationships because I'll be wanting validation from someone, or I'll want them to fall in love with me and, you know, so I can be with them. And I've noticed that this can like almost spoil like certain relationships, and I'm just hoping like if I don't know if you or anyone else can give me some advice about how to deal with those and these goals and these cravings that come up and like how to let them go because they feel like— I can see that like having these goals is detrimental to my well-being, but at the same time, you know, sometimes life feels meaningless without them. I mean, it's just so difficult to let go of.

**Speaker A:** These things. Anagami. All right, so here's what I would have about the goals, and that is have goals that you can meet. Have little goals that are easy to meet rather than having great big goals that are hard to meet. All right, so, uh, a big goal that would be hard to meet is to go make friends with 10,000 people so that they'll vote for you and you can become the city dog catcher. That would be a great big goal. A little goal would be just to go over to the neighbor's house and say hello. All right, so the little goals are what we're looking at. That I'm not saying become completely goal-free. No, there's going to be goals, but the bigger the goal, then the more likely you're going to be failing at it, and the more likely you're going to be struggling and trying to meet that goal. But if you make your goal small and easy, then you go around feeling like a champion all the time because you keep meeting your goals all time. And so, in the sense of the relationship now that you were talking about, is instead of having it as a goal to have a good relationship in a long-term situation, it's better to say, "Right now, my goal is to smile." And then we can smile, and that's all the goal that we need. Because if you have the very, very small goals, then the relationship will work itself out anyway. Now back to the issue of the pain that we were talking about before. Sometimes the pain, we have no choice about it. Sometimes the pains will just come. For old people, bursitis will happen, all kinds of things. I'll give you an inventory someday. But some pains are self-inflicted. In fact, most of the pains are self-inflicted. If we start watching how we self-inflict our pain, let us say that the accident did happen and it was painful, but how we deal with that pain can either be even more pain or it can be less pain, because that's our choice. Now let's take this perspective to relationships, that you do have control over how you feel, you do have control over how you present the relationship, but you don't have so much control over how other people are going to act. You don't have much control over other people primarily because they don't have any control over themselves anyway. I like the, uh, the phrase, uh, um, won't you be mine? Well, how can she give herself to me if she doesn't even own herself? She's a crowd in there anyway, and sometimes she's up, sometimes she's down. How can I hope that she's going to be mine all the time when she's not even hers all the time? And so that kind of relationship is not the kind that's going to be a relationship, because you're looking for it for the long term without giving people the freedom to be what they already are, which is a bundle of nerves, you know, a crowd. And so, uh, to have a really good relationship with someone requires either one of two things: either that she's not a crowd, or that you're not a crowd. And so the real goal that you could have is to get your own mind together so that you're not a crowd. And one of the parts about the crowd is sometimes you need her, sometimes you don't. Sometimes you really intentionally need her, and sometimes you want to get rid of her. We're back and forth. Every relationship is like that. Isn't that right, Robert? You know. All right, and so we wind up—.

**Speaker B:** I have a fun little anecdote, a third one, about either she's not a crowd or you're not a crowd, is you have someone that pushes you to not be a crowd. So, you know, like my girlfriend Sandra, you might notice I've been on every single one of the last 3 or 4 Skype calls because she told me I'm required to go to these weekly Sangha meetings.

**Speaker A:** So that was, that's kind of fun. But it's a happy requirement, right? So I think that we pretty well finished this. I want to round it back up for you, Robert, in the sense of don't make it a big goal to to have a big relationship, make it a little goal of how you're going to handle this moment with him or her. That's all we have to deal with, is just this little present moment. And it's okay to have goals. I mean, if you didn't even have the goal to go to the toilet, you'd be pissing all over yourself. We gotta have.

**Speaker D:** Little goals.

**Speaker A:** That makes sense. Yeah. And so let's have little goals. And one of the ways we can do that is by recognizing it with time frame. Okay, set the time limits for yourself. Is the goal that you have going to be completed in a year? Is it going to be completed within a week? Is it going to be completed within a day? I would recommend that we would have goals only a day long. In other words, by the next 24 hours or tomorrow. And an example of that would be, if you're going to go fly someplace, it's actually better to buy the ticket right before you go, because you can get bigger discounts that way. Um, and, and, uh, this is many, many little things like this that we can recognize at all. I've got to go to the bank, but since I'm not going to go to the bank today, I don't have to think about going to the bank today. I'll think about going to the bank on the day that I go to the bank. So this is a way to begin to have the goals smaller or shorter in time period. Don't make long plans, make short ones. An example of that is going to university. Don't go so that you can get a degree in 4 years, or don't go so that you could get this course. Go to this book right now and read this piece. This is the only goal that you have, is to read this piece, rather than long-term goals. We don't really need long-term goals; we can push those off. In fact, possibly the very, very best goal that you can set up is the goal of enjoying this next this next breath. That's a good goal. Yeah, that's a good goal to have, is this next breath. Let's have a good one. That's just one, one breath. This is all the goal that I need. If I could survive this one breath, then I'll be good to survive another one. So let's keep our goals very short in terms of time limit as well as ease. Let's set goals that we can meet. The important goals that we're talking about is being able to change the mind, to throw unwholesome thoughts out. That's the real goal. But not a long-term goal, just this thought is an unwholesome thought, let's get this thought out. And take a deep breath. And always come back to this present moment. And let's not make long-term goals, because we just set ourselves up for disappointment. Oh, someday my prince will come. Until he does, I'm going to be miserable. So let's not wake about— oh, wait until the prince comes. Let's go ahead and take a deep breath and enjoy it right here, right now. Throw the thoughts of the prince out and say, I'm okay right now, I don't need the prince because he's going to come only someday. And so bringing our whole goal system back into the present moment, or in short durations, 1 or 2 days, I used to do this, by the way, with the visas. I would plan months in advance the visas. Got to get a visa every year, and they are really, really a lot of work in the sense of how much paperwork. It's actually a stack of nearly 30 pages, 30 pages of work to do. Got to get the whole passport, every page of the passport's got to be photocopied, all of your bank statements for the past year. The medical exams is pages and pages long. You've got to have the lease, all kinds of stuff that has to be done for that visa. And there's enough to fret over. But now that I've done it many times, I recognize that the only time to think about that visa is the week before I've got to go. Thinking about it 2 and 3 months in advance is just a waste of my money. Moments and makes me feel bad. Because who wants to go deal with government agents? The answer is, hey, if you're ready to go, I do. I like government agents. I make them smile. But if we have the old idea, oh, I don't want to do it, and then we think about the visa months before it's done, we can only feel bad. So let's not have the goal of that visa It's, by the way, it's due on January the 17th, but it's only going to be like January the 5th or so before I even start thinking about that visa. I don't need to think about it now. If I think about it now, all I can do is feel bad. If I go Xerox all of that stuff now and put it in the closet, I'll forget where it was and have to go do it all over again anyway. So what's the point? Let's do things on time. So that would be the goal. The goal is to be timely. Let's do goals that are right here in front of us and not worry about the big ones. This present moment is the only moment we've got, so let's have the goal of spending this moment wisely.

**Speaker D:** Thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** That's really inspiring. That's good. I'm really glad. Well, does anybody have any more? We started talking about Paticcasamuppada and we wound up talking about Paticcasamuppada. This present moment is all we've got, and so, uh, let's look at it from that perspective of What's happening in your mind right now? How do you feel right now? What do you want right now? What do you like right now? That's the kind of way that we practice, is what's happening in the here and now. That's why the Buddha called himself Tathagata, the one who is in the here and now. So I see some nodding heads. Does anybody have.

**Speaker C:** Any comments?

**Speaker A:** Sounds good to me. Sounds good. Okay, Scott, great. I'm really glad to see you guys. You make my day. Oh, you make it too.

**Speaker B:** My moment.

**Speaker A:** Right back at you. All right, guys, well, let's finish now. Anybody got any last comments or any words?

**Speaker C:** It was good to see you guys.

**Speaker A:** See you next time. Well, I'm setting a goal here. I want to hear.

**Speaker D:** From everybody.

**Speaker A:** Thanks very much.

**Speaker D:** Thank you very much.

**Speaker A:** All right. Good to see you.

**Speaker C:** I see you're smiling.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Eric, good to see you. Yeah, it was great to see you. Where are you located right now, Eric? I'm in Missouri. Missouri. Oh, okay. Go see Buddha Moromzi. He's in Missouri. Really? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, walk in on him and plaster him with some Metta. That's just an idea. That's not a goal. All right guys, we will see you. Thank you so much.

**Speaker B:** Bye-bye. Take care everyone.

**Speaker A:** Cheers. Yes, happy— bye-bye. See you.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato, focuses on **Dependent Origination (Paticcasamuppada)**, emphasizing its practical, psychological understanding over abstract or literal interpretations. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme**
Dependent Origination is explained as a process of how suffering arises from ignorance and faulty mental processing, and how it can be interrupted through mindful awareness and wise choices.

---

### **Main Points Discussed**

1. **Ignorance (Avijjā) as the Foundation**
   - We all start life in complete ignorance as infants. Our early learning is built on this ignorant foundation, leading to flawed memory systems and perceptions.
   - Human memory is "shoddy"—we forget, distort, and even fabricate memories (e.g., false memories implanted in children, as in the Madeline Albright example).

2. **Mental Formations (Saṅkhāra)**
   - Our accumulated past experiences—body, speech, and mind habits—form our "kit bag" of reactions. These are often based on childhood ignorance and are unreliable.

3. **Consciousness (Viññāṇa) & Perception (Nāmarūpa)**
   - Consciousness here refers to **sensory input** (e.g., seeing, hearing).
   - Perception is the **interpretation** of that input using our past experiences (saṅkhāra). Two people can see the same thing (e.g., a nun) and react completely differently based on their past.

4. **The Six Sense Bases (Saḷāyatana) & Contact (Phassa)**
   - What truly "contacts" us and affects us is not the raw sense data, but our **processed interpretation** of it, filtered through our past.
   - This is where ignorance from the past pollutes our present experience.

5. **The Key Teaching: "Wisdom at the Point of Contact"**
   - The crucial practice is to insert wisdom **between contact and feeling**.
   - Example: You can **like** something (e.g., see an attractive person) without **wanting** or **clinging** to it ("I like it, but I don't want it" – Ajahn Chah & Sumedho story).
   - This breaks the automatic chain that leads to craving and suffering.

6. **Practical Training & Application**
   - **Change Your Data:** We can consciously add new, wholesome experiences and successful responses to our "kit bag" to overwrite old, ignorant reactions.
   - **Small, Manageable Goals:** Set short-term, achievable goals (e.g., "enjoy this breath," "smile now") rather than large, future-oriented ones that set you up for disappointment and interfere with relationships.
   - **Mindfulness in Rules:** Monastic rules (Vinaya) like avoiding malicious gossip are training tools to cultivate awareness and protect the community, not mere prohibitions.

7. **Non-Self (Anattā) and Constant Change**
   - The five aggregates (body, feelings, perceptions, mental formations, consciousness) are all impermanent and not-self.
   - Our sense of a fixed personality is a delusion. Recognizing we are constantly changing allows us to guide that change skillfully.

8. **Dealing with Pain**
   - Don't endure unnecessary, self-inflicted pain (e.g., forcing a painful meditation posture). This is not the Buddha's path.
   - Some pain is unavoidable; the practice is to relate to it wisely—investigate it without the automatic urge to reject it, or take sensible action to alleviate it if possible.

9. **On AI vs. Human Creativity**
   - A brief discussion notes that current AI operates on past data without true intent, unlike humans. The real issue isn't AI, but our own ignorant mental programming from the past.

### **Overall Message**
Dependent Origination is a **practical map of mental causality**. Suffering arises when ignorant past patterns automatically shape our present reactions. The path to freedom lies in:
- Bringing mindful awareness (**sati**) to the moment of contact.
- Using **wisdom** to pause before automatically liking/wanting or disliking/rejecting.
- Actively cultivating and reinforcing new, wholesome patterns to gradually overwrite the old, ignorant ones.
- Living with **short-term goals** focused on the present moment, which reduces craving and disappointment.

The talk concludes by bringing the entire teaching back to the present moment: the only time we can practice, change, and find freedom.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain the complex Buddhist concept of *Paticcasamuppada* (Dependent Origination) and related ideas about the mind, memory, and practice.

Here is a breakdown of the key metaphors and stories:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The Shoddy Memory System (Computer vs. Human):**
    *   **Metaphor:** Human memory is compared to a faulty computer.
    *   **Explanation:** A laptop can perfectly recall every pixel and line of dialogue from a movie. In contrast, human memory is "shoddy"—we construct it, lose details, and cannot play back experiences with perfect fidelity. This illustrates how our *saṅkhāra* (mental formations, memory) is built on and filtered by ignorance.

2.  **The "Kit Bag" or "Grab Bag of Tricks":**
    *   **Metaphor:** The mind's collection of past experiences and reactions is a bag of tools or data.
    *   **Explanation:** We fill this bag with data, much of it based on childhood ignorance. The practice involves consciously putting new, wholesome, "non-ignorant" information into the bag so we can use better data to process present-moment events.

3.  **The Guest in the House (Body):**
    *   **Metaphor:** The self is a guest, and the body is a house.
    *   **Explanation:** We don't own or fully control the body ("house"); we merely inhabit it. It ages and changes independently of our desires. This challenges the attachment to the body as "self."

4.  **Changing the Mind's Color (Red to Green):**
    *   **Metaphor:** Changing a habitual mental reaction is as simple and immediate as switching one's thought from the color red to green.
    *   **Explanation:** This demonstrates that we *can* change our mind in the present moment. We are not stuck with old programming. It's a practice exercise to prove our capacity for change.

5.  **Wisdom at the Point of Contact (The Filter):**
    *   **Metaphor:** The process between sensory input and feeling is like a filter or processor.
    *   **Explanation:** Raw sensory data (*rūpa*) is processed through perception (*nāmarūpa*), which is colored by our past (*saṅkhāra*). What "contacts" us and causes a feeling is not the raw event, but this processed interpretation. "Wisdom at the point of contact" means being aware of this filter and not blindly jumping to a liking/disliking reaction.

6.  **The Crowd (The Non-Unified Self):**
    *   **Metaphor:** An untrained person is not a single self but a "crowd" or "bundle of nerves."
    *   **Explanation:** Our moods and desires conflict (a "crowd in there"). This explains why seeking a permanent, stable relationship with another person is difficult—they are also a "crowd." The goal is to unify your own mind so "you're not a crowd."

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Madeleine Albright / Recovered Memory Scandal:**
    *   **Story:** References the 1990s scandal where children, influenced by prosecutors and therapists, constructed false memories of abuse, leading to wrongful convictions.
    *   **Purpose:** A powerful, real-world example of how memory is constructed, unreliable, and can be based on external influence (ignorance), directly supporting the point about faulty *saṅkhāra*.

2.  **The Two Men and the Nun:**
    *   **Story:** Two people see a nun. One, beaten by nuns in school, feels anger. The other, a seminary student, feels reverence.
    *   **Purpose:** Illustrates that it is not the sensory object itself (*rūpa*) that causes our reaction, but the processed perception (*nāmarūpa*), which is shaped entirely by our past experiences (*saṅkhāra*).

3.  **Ajahn Chah and Ajahn Sumedho at the Festival:**
    *   **Story:** At a festival with beautifully dressed women, Ajahn Chah asks Sumedho what he thinks. Sumedho replies, **"I like it, but I don't want it."**
    *   **Purpose:** This is presented as the quintessential example of "wisdom at the point of contact." It separates the feeling (*vedanā*) of "liking" from the subsequent chain of craving (*taṇhā*) and clinging (*upādāna*). It shows how a feeling need not lead to desire.

4.  **The Monk Needing the Bathroom:**
    *   **Story:** A monk needs to pass through a kitchen crowded with women to get to the bathroom. Instead of pushing through, he waits patiently until they notice and make way for him.
    *   **Purpose:** Demonstrates the practical application of Vinaya (monastic rules) as a mindfulness training. It replaces the impulsive "I want this, so I'll take it" mentality with patience and non-initiation, leading to a different kind of "power."

5.  **The Meditator with the Broken Arm:**
    *   **Story:** Uses the analogy of a broken arm healing in a cast. If you keep using the hand (grabbing things), it hurts and hinders healing. The wise response is to change behavior (stop grasping) to alleviate pain.
    *   **Purpose:** Teaches discernment regarding pain. Some pain is self-inflicted by our behavior (like grasping in meditation or life), and we can choose to stop. Other pain is unavoidable, and the practice is to relate to it wisely without adding mental suffering.

6.  **The Visa Paperwork:**
    *   **Story:** The speaker used to stress for months about the complex annual visa renewal. Now, he only deals with it the week before, avoiding months of needless worry.
    *   **Purpose:** Supports the advice on goals. Long-term goals (like a visa months away) create present-moment suffering. Short-term, manageable goals (deal with it when it's timely) reduce anxiety and keep focus on the present.

**Overall Purpose:** These metaphors and stories are used to demystify ancient Buddhist psychology, ground it in practical, modern examples, and provide memorable tools for understanding how the mind creates suffering and how mindfulness and wisdom can intervene in that process.
