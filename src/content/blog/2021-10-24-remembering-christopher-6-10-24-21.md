### Transcript


**Speaker A:** There is a weed whacker, gas-powered cutter in the back.

**Speaker B:** I hear it. Yeah. Oh no, it's fine.

**Speaker A:** But yeah, okay, it's pretty loud here, but I think it's a noise-canceling microphone. Um, in any case, You ask a question about remembering, and as you are most aware, Sati is the whole quality of remembering, except that Sati has the quality of remembering to look at what's going on right now. Now, the kind of question that you had was the fear of not remembering things that you need to remember at the point in time when you need to remember them the most,

**Speaker B:** right?

**Speaker A:** Almost like a kid who is getting ready for an exam. Yeah. Okay, is that kind of it?

**Speaker B:** That's exactly right. Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, the first thing that we can cover is the issue that the human memory is not very good. Let us say that humanity is evolution's first crack at consciousness, or let us say understanding that goes beyond dogs. Because dogs don't remember much of anything, right? There's not much to remember, in fact, that's worth remembering. But humans have the idea that things are worth remembering, and so we've had to learn to remember. An example of that would be that if the husband and wife has a big fight at 9 o'clock they'll be angry with each other all day. But if you punish a dog at 9 o'clock in the morning, he's going to be in your lap by noon, right? He will have forgotten all about it right now. Who's better off?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so, uh, the question then is, um, around the issue of what is worthy of remembering, because we already have established that we don't remember things very well. And the whole point of— and in fact, the proof of that is the reason that you called. In other words, if you had a really, really excellent memory, then that wouldn't be anything. But no matter how excellent someone's memory is, it could be improved.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** But in fact, there's a lot of improvement techniques that have been developed over time, a lot of improvement techniques. One of them, in fact, the one that I was taught, I think it was in the 6th grade, and that was the teaching that a short A short pencil is better than a long memory.

**Speaker B:** Write it down, right?

**Speaker A:** And yet I never took that to heart because I followed a different drummer, I guess, rather than that. Because all the kids take notes in class, everybody goes around with a short pencil trying to substitute that for a long memo. But the style that I used was pay attention to what's happening. If you're paying close attention to what's happening, that's the part of it that makes it rememorable, is because we're looking and we're paying attention. That generally the things that the kids forget on the test are the things they don't care much about anyway.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** But the things that they really care about, they're going to get that part right on the test. Okay, so every one of us is now in the position of going out and taking life's tests daily. It's like a pop quiz every day. Not only a pop quiz every day, but it's a pop quiz in every class that we're in and every day. So with that kind of understanding, everyone is going to be making mistakes on their test because they don't remember the answers to all of the questions. That is the definition of human society right there. If we could remember all that we are told, If we remembered all we were told because we were paying attention and listened to all that we were told and absorbed it interestingly as it was being told, then memories would be a lot higher. And so we have the issue of the input, then we have the sustainment of keeping it in memory, and then the bringing it up and reprocessing it in the current situation. So there's 3 aspects of memory. And that most of the problems with memory is the input. If we don't take it in properly, and if we don't take it in properly, then we don't get it. An example of that is the kid who's listening to the teacher in class when they're covering a subject and is really curious and interested in the topic back and asking questions, etc., like that. When it comes to the exam, he doesn't have to do much study on that particular topic because he already knows it. Where the other kids who weren't listening very carefully, when the time comes for the exam, now they've got to study. But they don't want to study, just like they didn't want to listen in class,

**Speaker B:** right?

**Speaker A:** And because they didn't want to study It's hard work. Learning is hard work when you don't want to do it. Everything is hard work when you don't want to do it. And so it's a lot about the attitude. So, uh, this is just typical. I'm not talking about you in particular, but everyone is like this. This is natural kind of thing. So if you have the interest in knowing something then you have the interest into learning it, and then it won't be a memory problem at all. There's another point about that that's really quite interesting, and that is going to Socrates, because Socrates in his dialogues and asking questions began to point out that learning is not absorbing data, but learning is in fact the ability to display that you have learned it, right? Okay, so take— in fact, the learning is the test itself, not the classroom time before the test, right? That's an interesting point, is can the student bring it up, that data that he has learned. And if he is emotionally involved with, "Oh no, I may bunk this test because I'm not sure about the answers," then while he's thinking about that, he's not thinking about the actual answers to the questions. But if he walks into the test with the attitude, "Oh, I've got this wired," then he'll enjoy taking the test. He may in fact think that he's guessing about an answer when in fact he kind of knew it all along anyway. But if he's afraid of the test, then he's adding a whole lot of extra emotional baggage to it. Okay, so let's look at that, knowing that learning has these three qualities: the input, that if we're curious and interested in something, then, and can figure it out. Sometimes it takes a while to figure it out, but once we figure it out, generally the component parts that came to putting this thing together in the mind, we remember them because we mulled them over and we figured it out. Okay, and so generally not remembering something also has the quality of doubt built into it because we're not— we don't really understand because we don't have track of all of the features and factors. And this is kind of an important point, is that if we understand the overall point then we can put things into context a lot better. Possibly an example of that would be the first lesson or the first classroom that a professor at the university teaches is the most important class because that's the class where he tells the students what they should be paying attention to, what's important to him. And he'll announce that, and then he may never say it again for the whole rest of the class. He just assumes that everybody is taking the context that he has set up and putting all the information into that context so they can plug it in here and plug it in there and get a sense of really what's going on. But most kids, we just kind of collect data, individual points of data, because we think that's going to be a question on an exam. Without putting it into the context. So the way that we gather data and our attitude about it, and the way that we store data in the sense that are we storing the data just as individual random pieces of data, or are we putting that data into a context or into, let us say, finding a place or a niche where this information or this piece of data fits in, right? Um, that's a really, really valuable point, is to recognize that. So, um, the, the bigger or deeper point now— we've talked about getting the data in and, and processing it in a way so that it will store and to say because it's got a context and it fits in with other facts. Now we have to look at how we're going to bring the data out at the time when we're actually taking the test. Okay, now we have— that's the third item. When and how are we going to handle this particular thing also has a lot to do with attitudes. In the sense of, oh, I've got this, I can handle this easily enough because I understand the context in the first place. And so understanding of the context is how we're going to plug all of the details of knowledge into place. And then we have the confidence that we can bring that whole context back out to fit that data in. This is very, very handy for taking the test, but all of this has to do with emotional stuff. Then in fact, the emotional part is the bigger issue, because if you're curious and interested in the information in the beginning then it's easier to gather the information. If we're curious and interested in how this data fits into the context of things, then we'll have it stored better, right? And if we have the right attitude when we take the test, then we'll be able to access that data much easier without having to have a pity party about, do I remember it or not? Okay, so with that context, we can start looking at the deeper point then, is the Sati that we need to remember how to remember things. So Sati then is the process of remembering rather than the facts that are to be remembered. Okay, so when we're learning something, if we have the Sati to remember that I will learn this and remember it better if I am curious and interested in it, and if I'm not interested in it, then I probably won't learn it. But see, we don't even think about that. We just think of this as something that I've got to learn, and we don't pay attention to the fact that I'm not interested in this topic at all. I just— I'm not interested. I was assigned this class, I was put into this class, and I'm just not even interested in the topic, right? Or I can't do it, which is another one. The attitude that I can't do it, I can't learn this. And we, we picked that habit up as, as kids, okay? That this is beyond me. But it's really— the information is not beyond us. What really is going on is that we are not interested enough in the topic to want to learn the data, right? If we are curious and interested in the topic a lot, then we will mull it, we will pick it up, we will look for new data, we'll look for various ways of doing it. And then when we do get the correct understanding of it all the constituent components that we needed to get that understanding are now part of the memory bank because we've exercised them. A really good example of that is calculus, because calculus is really difficult to understand, but when you do understand the various pieces and parts of the calculus process, then we understand calculus. But by understanding the calculus Does that mean that now that we can remember all those constituent components, right? That's the important point. So we're coming again back to the attitude. Attitude is everything.

**Speaker B:** So do you cultivate— are you saying cultivate, uh, that attitude with things that you normally aren't interested with in, or create an interest?

**Speaker A:** Well, you don't have to decide that. If you have wisdom, you can decide whether this is worth learning or not, rather than doing that decisions subconsciously based on the feelings, right?

**Speaker B:** Okay, so make it conscious, I guess.

**Speaker A:** Make it conscious, exactly. Look at what you're going— have the Sati enough to recognize how you feel about it right now. Okay, okay, that's the important thing. And we need that all three times. We need it when we're learning it, we're needing it when we organize it, and we need it when we're bringing it back out. Okay, we need that Sati all three times because you've heard me say it in the sense of Murphy's Law, that anything that can go wrong will go wrong, and it will go wrong at the worst possible moment. In this case, learning something is the worst possible moment. I've got to learn this fact, okay? Anything that can go wrong will go wrong, which means I didn't remember it. I didn't remember it. I've forgotten it, or I never learned it in the first place well enough, okay? So this is the way that we're going to approach this, is this present moment. What is my attitude towards this? Can I change my attitude towards it? Now there's something else with that, and that is that there is also— it's the same kind of memory exactly, but it has to do with that paying attention that we talked about in the sense of learning something. A really example of what I'm talking about is that the guy opens the door to his house because he's in a hurry to get to the bathroom, and on the way he sets down his cell phone and his car keys on the way to the toilet.

**Speaker B:** Now I can't find them.

**Speaker A:** Now he can't find either one of them. He didn't pay attention to where he set those things down because his only intention was to get to the toilet. And that's what he had in his mind. And because of that, he wasn't paying attention to setting the phone down. So this is again how we begin to recognize that we've got a learning here, if we remember to remember, or if we remember to look, if we remember to pay attention, if we are practicing various aspects of Anapanasati, including with the hands and whatnot, because we're conscious and aware of our hands so much. When we set something down, we know that we're setting it down and we know where we put it. One of the things that happened to me, just on a side note, was that when I was a child, I was— I think all kids are very, very disorganized. And sloppy, and this and that can go anywhere because we're not paying attention to where we put stuff. That goes for a while if you don't own much. In other words, if you've only got 3 pairs of pants, you can probably keep track of 3 pairs of pants. But if you've got 75 pairs of pants You may not remember where all of them are. There may be some of the pants in the basement that you haven't worn in years and you've forgotten all about them, you see. All right. However, if you had a closet that was very, very organized, and all 75 pairs of those pants would be right there in the closet because you, you organized them and you paid attention to where things were being placed.

**Speaker B:** Right now you're not spending an hour looking for it every day, right?

**Speaker A:** You spent the hour organizing the stuff, and now you don't have to spend many, many hours looking for stuff because it's all organized. I had to learn that lesson after I was a computer scientist, because see, the number of physical things that I own is probably under 10,000, probably under 1,000, but the number of files that I own and take care of is in the millions, and they need to be organized. An example of that is Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's stuff needs to be kept together under a label of Bhikkhuni Buddhadasa, as opposed to Ajahn Chah's stuff is under the label of Ajahn Chah, and I don't mix the two together, nor do I mix all the other stuff and just throw it in there. But if you've got movies, the way that they're organized here is Westerners— there's one hard drive that has only Westerns, or another hard drive that has only old movies. Okay, so this is all about the organization. So paying attention to how things are organized in the house means that we can remember where we put them. The same The same thing is true about abstract information, that if we remember the context, or remember how this stuff fits in or where it belongs, then we can easier remember it. And so a lot of this also has to do with the paying attention to where we put stuff in the beginning. So this goes around again about the attitude of, am I well organized? If I'm going to be exposed to this information, the only reason why I would is because I'm going to need it later. Let me make sure that I'm actually putting this data in my mind in a place where I can find it later.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** That we do that with our mind, that we have the mind disorganized, just like we have the house disorganized. And now we're looking for the car keys and the cell phone inside the mind. Because things are not organized there either. So we're talking about the organization. These are all, let us call it, memory tricks, or things that you can do consciously in the beginning. For instance, if the kid walked into the class with the intention of, I've got to learn and pay attention to what the teacher was saying, then he's much more likely to do that. He's got that attitude that I want this and I'll get it. Most kids, when they go into class, they don't have that attitude. They don't get that attitude until exam time, right?

**Speaker B:** They're thinking about what they're going to do after class, right?

**Speaker A:** Right, exactly. That what we're doing right this very moment is, uh, is unvaluable, not wholesome. So, basically what I'm leading all of this up to is that each of these three periods of time, the initial period of collecting the data, the organization of the data where it fits into a particular context, like as the example of Western movies go into the Western directory. Directory, and the old movies go in the old directory, and chick flicks go into the chick flick directory, and Asian martial arts movies go into a category with Asian martial arts movies. That way we can find them because we know what we're looking for, because we know the organization. All right, we can do that also with our knowledge of, say, history or music or whatever else the class is, or in fact the kind of job that we have will require us to remember to put things in, to get them organized so that they fit into a context, and then we can retrieve that data at the right time. All three of those events are problematic for people so that we don't take information in very well. We don't keep track of it very well. We don't have it very well organized, and then we're not able to pull that data out when we need it, even though the data may be in there. It's surprising to me how accurate our storage mechanism is. It's just that the retrieval is so lousy. That's true. That in fact many, many people who have gotten into meditation and have done a lot of clearing out, one of the surprises is that they begin to remember things that happened long ago that they had completely, basically in quotations, forgotten all about. Most people do not remember many of the things that happened to them before the age of 5 or 6. We just don't remember that stuff. Why? Because we weren't organizing, we weren't paying any attention to it. But once we get the mind more organized, that data will be accessible. So that you can remember many, many thousands of things that happened when you were 2 and 3 and 4 years old that we normally would not have access to because of all of the other things that are disorganized in the mind. And that one of the ways that we disorganize things is by— just like in computers, a file will have a name to it, or it'll have a way of accessing it, that you could sort files by date to look at. Maybe the thing happened at that a particular date and whatnot. One of the ways that us humans organize stuff within the mind is with the emotion, in the sense that we put all the stuff that really, really hurt off into the category of this really hurts, right? Okay. And with, with that kind of organization system, then we don't want to deal with things that really, really hurt, so we kind of forget all about them. And yet they keep coming back up, and when they do, we hurt. Because we hurt, all we really remember then is the hurt, not the details. But if we can dredge something up without having any emotional baggage, it doesn't hurt anymore. Now I could see it more clearly. And so this is also a point that when we, when we store things, we often store it with a lot of emotional baggage.

**Speaker B:** But you also aren't— go ahead. Our, our, like, most memories I have seem to be flashes. They're not really movies per se, you know what I mean? They're little bits of stuff which then will associate to another little small bit You know, like I get a quick image, emotion, you know, it's— that's exactly right.

**Speaker A:** Congratulations for seeing that. That was something that I was going to cover, and that is, is that you're exactly right, because if there is emotional baggage to that memory, then all we have to do is have the flash of that memory, and now the next mind moments are going to be in emotion, they're going to be in feeling, they're going to be in reaction to that flash, as opposed to continuing that flash and making it a movie because we're paying attention to the movie rather than paying attention to how we feel about the movie.

**Speaker B:** Ah,

**Speaker A:** all right. So, but this happens a lot, that people will have a flash of a thought and then they'll have a feeling about it. Let's say the feeling is anxiety.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** And then they come to the therapist or to their guru or someone and say, I feel this anxiety, but we call it free-floating, or I don't know where it comes from.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** The answer to that is that's because they're not paying attention to those flashes, that one mind moment that takes about a tenth of a second that can be just colors. But it doesn't have to be details. An example of that is, is that you see an invoice and you don't want to pay it, so you put it down. But that invoice has kind of flashes, let us say the flash of the logo of the company that sent it, or the flash of the way that the lines are seen on the paper, so that you can have a flash of that invoice come popping up in the mind, and immediately we start feeling bad. But it was just a flash of an invoice. We didn't even see the invoice. It happened too fast for us to get any details at all about that invoice, right? Then in fact, when we first saw the invoice, all we saw was the bottom line of it. We didn't even pay attention to any of the details of it. So that was not part of memory anyway, that all we have is that piece of paper that flashes in the mind, followed then by bad feelings. But even though we didn't pay much attention to that invoice when we saw it the first time, because we immediately went into bad feelings because we saw only the bottom line, if you sit without the feelings, you can actually reconstruct in your mind that invoice. Most of the details are there. You saw it. That data came in, but it didn't come in in a way that's accessible, especially when the thought of it comes back up. It brings up emotions also. This is exactly what happens to the kid when he's taking the test, that when he sees that question, he's going to have— instead of dredging up his memory and thinking about it and paying attention to the question itself, he's already in bad feelings. I don't know what's going on. And that's exactly what started this with, uh, when, when you first called about the point that we, that we don't remember things, and then we feel bad because we don't remember things, right? And now that we're feeling bad, that's what's going on, is the bad feelings about not remembering things. If you have Sati, if you can wake up to that, you can say, never mind that question, I'll come back to it later. Let me not get myself into a bad state. It's not important. Yeah, I'm not going to remember everything. Let me go do what I can do and get and, and feel good about it. So maybe even the right way to take a test is to read through the test before you ever answer any of the questions. Because if you're reading through it without the intention of answering the question, then you can read through it and probably get more out of the question. Because many times, in fact, most teachers do it this way intentionally for the kids, is that they put the questions that has the answer built into the question itself, right? It's true. All you have to do is read the question properly and the answer to it probably built in. Um, I, I find that consistently amusing that teachers put the, uh, they, they answer the question as they're— by the way that they're asking the question, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Putting two things in the question together means that the answer to that question lies in those two elements that are in the question. So we can find ways of digging through that, but we have to be free from the emotion. Well, basically Anapanasati is all about that anyway. What I'm saying is that it is fairly well known that when people are skilled and are practicing meditation correctly, their ability to assimilate data and remember it goes up substantially. Why? Because it's not got the emotional component in there anymore. That when we store things, we don't store them under the emotion, we store them in a more logical place of where they belong. Right. Okay, so the whole point then is to have Sati when you're learning, have Sati when you're understanding and putting the stuff together, and to have Sati when you retrieve the data. It's all about the Sati, to remember how you feel and to remember that you can feel the way that you want to feel about the learning. Okay, now even if it's old data that you had learned and didn't learn it very well, but now you need that data, and since you— the immediate thought is, oh, I don't know, and then we begin to feel bad because we can have flashes of things that give us confusion, as well as a flash of something like an invoice that gives anxiety. We can have a flash of something and we become confused. So that, uh, there, there is a, a way of talking about that. We can call it see-feel, that we can see things or flashes of, of something in the mind, and then we wind up feeling, feeling bad about it, right? Instead of staying on that and continuing with the flashes. So we go only for the flash of the data itself, and then we spend the rest of the time, oh, poor me, I don't know the answer to that. Oh, I should have studied harder, right?

**Speaker B:** I get more of a, I should have remembered that because now it's causing another issue that I didn't remember, you know, on just daily items or whatever, or You know, if it's, you know, a financial thing that I needed to remember and I didn't do it or whatever. But usually it's, you know, just regret that I didn't remember something at the appropriate time. You know?

**Speaker A:** Okay. But now the problem is not that you've forgotten. The problem is now that you're regretting.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay. That you've gotten. And so what you could remember, the Sati was, oh, just because I've forgotten something doesn't mean that I have to be in regret. That I can take responsibility for that, that in fact the feeling of the taking— that yes, I did that, I screwed it up, I'll learn something from that, right?

**Speaker B:** Well, I, I, I know this is not the right way to think about it, but I do— I often think about it in the fact that if I don't— this is where the remembering part comes— if I don't repeat this and beat myself up about it, I'm going to forget it again. So that's— I guess that's kind of the back in the back of my mind. Like, if I let this go and don't make it really important, then I'm going to forget this again, and then that's going to cause even more trouble. So it's a circular kind of thing. I mean, I know it's stupid.

**Speaker A:** Well, and that kind of stuff though can be taken care of with the calendar. That's the short pencil is better than a long memory.

**Speaker B:** Right, right. Well, I have an issue with that too because I have a to-do list that's like 4,000 items. So I think I overdo that too. But, but yes, I do understand what you mean by that. Um, yeah, I mean, I try to write everything down. I do. I'm, I'm a calendar freak and a to-do freak, almost probably too much.

**Speaker A:** So, okay, well, probably that you're doing that. So you're, you're hearing what I'm saying and you're saying, yeah, I'm checking that, but but you're, you're such a calendar freak because you're afraid that you're going to forget something.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. Yes.

**Speaker A:** Ah, okay. Well, that means that you're calendar freak doesn't solve your bad feelings.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that's true.

**Speaker A:** You don't trust your calendars, right?

**Speaker B:** Or I get overwhelmed by them, you know. You know, when the to-do list is so long, it's like, oh God. You know,

**Speaker A:** um, while I understand that, I also understand that the lifestyle that we have chosen winds up having way, way too much to try to keep track of. That, and we can say that in the sense of that your, your to-do list is so long because your greed for getting things done is so great. That's true, that you want a lot of stuff, and now you want so much of the stuff, and now you're going to forget that you might— uh, you're worried that you might forget about something that you want because you want so many things. So that's another way then, if you've already got the calendar stuff arranged, we can begin to trust the calendar. If you trusted it enough that you wrote it down on the calendar, then you can trust the calendar. And occasionally you can go through the calendar, say, yep, yep, yep, yep, I remember I've got to do that, I remember I've got to do this and that and the other thing, and begin to trust the calendar, right? But now we're going to also go to the point of making decisions or choices about what we're going to put on that calendar, because Because as you said, your calendar has got tens of thousands of things on it based upon all the things that you want. And that much of Anapanasati is to recognize that that wanting is in fact making us dissatisfied with the way that we are. So you've got a whole lot of stuff that you want So you've got a whole lot of reasons to be dissatisfied.

**Speaker B:** That's correct. Often I notice a lot of the things on my list are wanting things for other people too, which I really don't have a lot of control over. So yeah, I mean, yeah, the wanting thing is pretty big.

**Speaker A:** There's two ways to approach that. One way of approaching it is sort of like the Buddha's method is kind of a one-two punch, in the sense that the way that Western society works, we want to do it instead of the one-two punch that the Buddha has, and the Buddha's method is is to go and get away from all the things that we want. Go get into seclusion and practice to become satisfied with the way things are. Once we become satisfied with the way things are, now we can come back into the world if we can maintain that satisfaction. If we can't, we go back into the forest for a little while longer and get ourselves back into a state, and we need to go back and forth many times until we can come back to society and maintain the satisfaction. Because now we can begin to teach the world to have satisfaction. But it's impossible to teach the world something that you don't know yourself, right?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** It's impossible to teach something, uh, if we don't know it. And so if we have that satisfaction That means that we can go back into the world and operate from that perception. Now, if you think about it this way, you can say that, well, if I want things for someone, let's say just Person X in my life, what— why do I want that person to have so much stuff that I want them to have when in fact all I really want them to have is some joy and satisfaction in life? Whether they get the stuff that they want or not, or whether they get the stuff I want them to have or not. The real issue for them is to have joy and satisfaction in their life. So if you can have that perspective, that means that all you have to do now is to have joy and satisfaction in your own life so that you could give them the joy and satisfaction that you want them to have. And you don't need to want them to have anything else.

**Speaker B:** So you, you be the example on other ones, right? That's what you're saying.

**Speaker A:** Well, another example would be that the father wants his daughter to get a good education so she'll have a good life. He browbeats her her whole life. You got to study, you got to work, you got to do this. If she winds up getting a PhD in misery—

**Speaker B:** I'm guilty of that kind of stuff—

**Speaker A:** when all Daddy really wanted was daughter to have a good life. But now he starts piling on: in order to have a good life, you've got to have a good education. In order to have a good education, you got to go to this school and that school and over, you know, and all of that. And so Dad winds up with a long list of stuff that he wants for his daughter. But the original point was that he just wanted her to be happy.

**Speaker B:** Sure, sure. Yeah, but you just— I mean, you obviously— I want my kids to have skills to be able to move through life successfully. Or whatever. But you're right, I mean, you know, a lot of the approach to getting them to do that is not wholesome in any sense of the term, right?

**Speaker A:** So in fact, if you could teach them to be satisfied, now all they have to do is learn how to move through life being satisfied, right? But your position is, is no, you've got to teach them to move through life to find satisfaction. Right, instead of starting out with the satisfaction from the very beginning. Right, that's the difference in the teachings of the Buddha. Now we can go into it in looking at it from a different perspective in the sense of Christianity, because Christianity, a major, major important high-quality teaching of Christianity is the Golden Rule, to take care of each other, to love thy neighbor as thyself, friendship, neighborliness, that kind of thing. And if someone practices that, then they can learn to do that out of practice. But in the process of learning how to do it, also are filled with a lot of ordinary feelings, and so it's fits and starts and difficult to get. It would be possible to learn to love and to be happy while staying in the world, but the Buddha recommends, no, we got to get out of it for a while, we've got to get away from it all so that we can really do some cleaning of the house to get the mind back into satisfaction including the satisfaction of, "Hey, I don't have to remember everything, but I can remember enough." That's the way, OK? If I can remember enough, then I can be happy. I don't have to remember everything, because if I have to remember everything, then I'm going to browbeat and harm myself every time I recognize that I've forgotten something, even if it's trivial and doesn't even matter. We still wind up feeling bad because we've got the idea, I've got to remember everything, rather than the whole point in life is that, no, I don't have to remember everything. All I need is to be satisfied. That's what we have to remember,

**Speaker B:** is

**Speaker A:** to remember to be satisfied, to remember that everything is okay, to remember that, yes, I can take my mind and come out of those flashes so that when that flash of the invoice happens and then the bad feelings come associated with it, let's remember at that point in time, hey, I don't have to feel bad because that invoice is not paid. That paying the invoice or not paying the invoice is one thing, but how I feel about it is something completely different.

**Speaker B:** And what do you— at that point, do you talk to yourself about that? Or— now you were talking about remembering the invoice in detail. I mean, I mean, should you do that or just say to yourself, that's not really— I mean, I can come to that invoice later. I mean, what, what is that basically what you would say?

**Speaker A:** Or— well, the point would be then is that whether that invoice, um, is on the table or on the shelf or wherever it— right now, while I'm thinking about that invoice, as that flash of the invoice comes by, I'm not paying it right now, right? I may pay it later, but right now I'm not paying it. I'm only feeling bad about not paying it. That's what we have to look at and remember. Oh, I'm not paying the invoice. Why am I thinking about it right now? Or we could say, oh, I remembered that invoice. That reminds me that I've got to pay it. Now that I'm remembering and reminding myself to pay it, I'll pay it right now. Okay, okay. And if I pay it right now, now the question is, do I feel good while I'm paying that invoice, or do I feel bad while I'm paying the invoice? Okay, so again, we have this, uh, in a way I'm adding something new to remember rather than, uh, all the stuff that, uh, you have to remember already. I'm adding something to it. So that is to remember to look at how you feel about what you're doing right now. Over and over again. This is the teaching of the Buddha, is to wake up, to recognize that you've got a choice over how you feel right now. That is a different choice than whether you're going to do something right now.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** There is in fact a corral, or, you know, it's got four quadrants to it with a vertical line and a horizontal line. Let's use the vertical line to talk about the distinction between I'm not going to do something and I'm going to do it. Okay, I'm not going to pay that invoice right now, or I'm going to pay the invoice right now. It may be also the third one, I'm going to pay the invoice later, but that's the same thing as just saying no, I'm not going to pay the invoice now. Okay. Later we'll pay the invoice, but right now, no. Okay, so maybe even later I'm going to defy it, I'm not going to pay that invoice, I'm going to talk to the guys, they sent it to the wrong guy, it's the wrong amount or something like that. But in any case, the choice is to pay it or to not pay it. But now we've got this horizontal line, and that horizontal line is how do we feel about it. That at the bottom we have the feeling of I don't like it, I don't like that invoice, I don't want to pay it. And then we have the feeling of liking. So with that, with the quadrant now, most people will not pay it and feel bad. Others will pay the invoice and feel bad. But you have the option of when you think of that invoice and you're not going to pay it, you can feel good and say, "Oh, later, never mind right now, I'm having too much fun, I'm not going to pay that invoice." invoice right now. I'm having fun. And so we cannot pay it and feel good. And then eventually we can feel good by paying it and said, wow, I'm glad I got that off my chest. I don't have to think about that anymore. It's done. Okay, but so here's the point. It's not about whether we pay the invoice or not right now. It's how we feel about it right now. And we have to remember that. That's the point to remember, is that there's two jobs to do. One is to pay the invoice or not, and the other job is how am I going to feel about it? Because we've never paid attention to how we feel about it. Our whole society is built up on whether we do the job or not.

**Speaker B:** True. So that's a right effort thing, right? So that, that's a thing where you would come in and say, well, I'm feeling this right now, and now I can reframe that as, well, this is great, it's done now, or whatever it is that you want, you know, whatever reframe you're going to use to try to you know, to make yourself feel better about it, essentially, right?

**Speaker A:** Precisely. Yeah, you can use the word reframing if you like. That is a common term. And we can think of that framing as actually the circumstances or the things that are around it. Okay, in the sense of the organization, this is how things are organized. And we normally organize around doing things and feeling bad. That's the number one place where people spend most of their time, is they do it but they don't like it, right? How many people have a job that they don't like?

**Speaker B:** It's almost everyone.

**Speaker A:** Almost everyone. So almost every day people go out and spend quite a lot of time doing something that they don't want to do.

**Speaker B:** That's correct.

**Speaker A:** And we don't even pick up on that because we see that getting the job done is the most important thing. But now we're reframing the whole point of it in that it's not what you do, it's how you feel about doing it. And we've got that also built into our society, is just not very strong. An example of it in the old days, and I haven't heard this in modern professional sports anywhere near the way that it would have been said 50, 70 years ago, and that is that What they said back then was, it's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game. That could be like being— are you a sore loser? Are you a good loser? Can you handle that? Okay. But now we've gotten to the point that no, the game is the only thing. How you play the game is irrelevant. You can cheat, you can lie, you can steal, you can harm yourself, you can harm other people so long as you remain president, or whatever the goal is, right?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** So the doing is far more important than, um, uh, the living of the experience. So now we're going to make the living of the experience the most important thing, and whether we win or lose is irrelevant. The fact is that we're going to enjoy playing the game, right? This is the new way of looking at it. But we have to remember that because we're such in a habit of trying to get the job done that we're not paying attention to how we feel about it. So now we have to start remembering to pay attention to how do we feel. That's right, we really have to pay attention to that. So this is what we need to remember, because this is actually the easy thing, because I'm substituting now instead of having to remember 10,000 things because of a 10,000-item-long to-do list, now I'm adding one new thing to remember, and that is to remember to look at what you're doing, look at how you're feeling, look at the situation in this present moment, because when you do that and you can become satisfied in this present moment, then that to-do list is not so important anymore.

**Speaker B:** More, right?

**Speaker A:** That we've made it important because we're in the habit of feeling bad when things on the list don't get done, or that we don't remember the answer to the test. But if we're completely satisfied, then we don't have to take the test, right? Now, I know that that goes against the society. The society has been telling us our whole lives, no, you've got to go work. You've got to go do something that you don't want to do. You got to do things. You got to work to eat is one of them. Okay, here's something just really interesting that because of COVID and other things like that, you probably heard that many, by the millions of people, either did not go back to their jobs when COVID was over and people went back to work work, or those people who were already working or had gone back to work, many of them are quitting.

**Speaker B:** Huge amount over here. Yeah, it's hard. They have to pay like $10 more an hour to get, you know, somebody to do anything now over here.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, congratulations to humanity for finally waking up to recognize that that job that I had, that I was told that I have to have and that I'm supposed to have, comes with so many side issues that the job itself winds up being, let us say, only a part of the issue. The example is clothing, transportation, eating lunch out at the restaurant. Childcare, all kinds of things like that that we have as expenses because we have to have the job. When I worked for IBM, I had a whole closet full of suits, whole closet full of white shirts. Many of them had oil stains on them, so you couldn't wear it anymore with an oil stain unless it was covered up with a suit coat.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** Okay, now I don't even own a suit. Yeah, don't even have one. Don't, don't have one white shirt, not one necktie. I'd be hard-pressed to find an old pair of socks someplace. Any socks that I could find would be at least 10, maybe 15 years old.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we definitely need a lot less than, uh, what people— I mean, I've, I've been torn between both worlds. I've been sort of a slacker, and I've done stuff, but I've never really had a regular job in my whole life, so I'm happy about that. But on the other hand, you know, I make jobs in my mind, so might as well have just done the regular job. But you're right, I mean, I feel like if I'm not doing something, then I'm, you know, I'm not— you know, that is a Western thing. Like, if you're not you know, actively, you know, making something happen, even though I really don't need anything, you know what I mean? Like, I could sit home and have a meal with my family. I don't need to go out anywhere. You don't need to go do anything. And it's just enjoyable just to be around with people.

**Speaker A:** One of the students just sent a little story, and the story is, is that a fisherman was sitting in his boat resting and enjoying the day. And the wealthy tycoon came by and he says, why aren't you out fishing? If you go out fishing, you can get enough fish to buy a motor for your boat, and then you could go out fishing easy, go further out and get even more fish, and you can sell that. And when you get all of that fish, uh, you can become wealthy like me, and then 'Now you can sit down and relax.' And the fisherman says, 'I'm already relaxed.' Yeah, but this is the way. And but we have bought that industrialist mental state that we've got to go get more and more and more and more and more, and then we can retire. Except that most people— I wouldn't say most. But it is very characteristic, probably 30 or 40% of all the people who retire, let us say at an arbitrary 65, by the time they're 67, they're dead.

**Speaker B:** Right? Yeah. Yeah. They don't know what to do with themselves.

**Speaker A:** They don't know what to do with themselves because they, they, because they wouldn't lay down and just relax because they were told they've got to go get more fish so that they can buy a motor so that they can get even more fish. And so that's how we live our lives without being satisfied with the way that we are. So this is the thing then, is to remember, this is what Anapanasati is all about, is to get away from the world, because the world is going to keep giving you marching orders. And so we need to get away and get out of seclusion. And maybe 1 hour a day is not enough, and we need to to kind of take a real vacation, but another way of looking at it, no, if I do this 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 times a day, getting away from it and reevaluating my mind, I could get some progress done here. I think that the one that doesn't work is 1 hour or 2 hours in one sitting meditation. That doesn't give people a lot of value, but if they quit their job and come hang out on an island without any meditation at all. They're much better off because at least they're hanging out, as opposed to working and working and working. And they probably become more relaxed. So, what we can practice then is 4, 5, 6 times a day, taking 10 minutes to just clean the mind out and get ourselves back into a state of relaxation, into a state of satisfaction. Everything is okay right now. And if you practice that 6 times a day, it will begin to seep

**Speaker B:** in and bleed over. I know, I will say, I haven't gotten up to 6 times a day. I'm doing maybe 3 times a day. I'm going to work on building it up to the 6.

**Speaker A:** But One thing, 10 minutes, 10, 15.

**Speaker B:** It's only 10 minutes. Yeah, yeah. But the— but when I— I don't— I haven't noticed any seeping over into the real world, as you know, as much as I'd hope for, um, yet. So I mean, does that just improve over time?

**Speaker A:** Well, it does. And one of the things then that we have to do is say, okay, I'm going to remember to let it bleed over. I'm going to remember to take a deep breath every couple of hours. Or we can have— I used to give students the idea of using a cell phone, and I recognize that there's a lot of meditation cell phone apps, but because the culture is such that people get really attached to cell phones and we don't really need them anyway, then I wouldn't really recommend you would do it, but you can remember every 30 minutes, or you can make kind of a rule: every 30 minutes you're going to stop what you're doing and take a deep breath and relax. Or maybe once an hour, every hour you're going to take a deep breath and relax and start bringing this into the context of just relaxing. You're okay, you don't have to remember everything. All you have to do is to remember that you're okay, right? Just remember everything's all right.

**Speaker B:** On that note, I do have a— I do— there's one thing that nags me. When you talked about, you know, uh, people not working, and then, you know, people, uh, think they have to work to eat, I, I, I have a tough time thinking that you can't You know, how are you going to eat without working? I mean, I mean, yeah, sure, you can have people give you food, but someone had to go do the work to get the food. I mean, I mean, somewhere it's got to come from somewhere.

**Speaker A:** So you probably have heard— I mean, we can go off into all kinds of directions about that, but it's not an issue with the food because you probably heard that the way that our food industry is set up, they throw throw out about 30% of it.

**Speaker B:** I didn't know that. No.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, they throw out— yeah, any tomato that's irregular, they're not going to put it on the fruit stand because people won't buy that. That'll be the last tomato that's bought, and so they don't. And so that's just one example of it. But even though that one tomato that has got a spot on it would have not been sold in the guess what? At the end of the day, a whole lot of tomatoes weren't sold at the store, and the store's got to throw out a whole lot of tomatoes. Okay, so I'm just looking at it from the position that it's not a matter of the lack of food, because we've got plenty of food. Gotcha. Okay, that's the first thing to look at. The next thing to look at is the issue of that not only has— let us call it big business for lack of a better term— that big business has decided that they would rather make a huge profit off of selling two-thirds of the food and let the other third rot. They would also rather you keep working whether you're productive or not.

**Speaker B:** That is true. They do want to have everybody working nonstop. There's a lot of movement towards that, right?

**Speaker A:** So when people talk about AI robbing all of the jobs, there has been no point in the history of technology that technology has put a whole segment of people out of work and they've maintained that being out of work. No, because the society wants everybody out there slaving, trying, working; that in fact, that's what's starting to unravel capitalism, is the fact that people understand that they're not benefiting from the capitalism. Uh, like we mentioned about in the U.S., a lot of people are quitting their jobs. There's also something happening now in China. It's called laying down.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I read that article. Yeah, you guys

**Speaker A:** put up. Yeah, so the laying down that they're doing in China is basically the same thing. They are rebelling. The young people are rebelling against the the government because the government is only giving them things because of productivity issues.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they want everyone to work 80 hours a week over there. That's insane.

**Speaker A:** I think it's called 996, from 9 in the morning till 9 at night, 6 days a week.

**Speaker B:** Wow. Wow. At least that's one good thing the U.S. did, is they had all those social movements that happened, and it kind of you know, at least reduce some of the hours a little bit.

**Speaker A:** But wasn't that during the 1930s, during the Roosevelt administration, which was the worldwide, especially the American reaction to the Great Depression?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the Depression.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Because everybody was out of work. And guess what? When people are out of work because of the Great Depression, very, very, very few people starved to death during the Great Depression, that it wasn't an issue of starvation because there was all kinds of food kitchens and people would give food out and all kinds of things. And so we actually got more efficient because there was not so much work being done. So we're talking about it now from a societal level that kind of proves what's going on in China, what happened in the 1930s, and the people are quitting their jobs, everyone is beginning to, on their own level, prove that if you don't work, you don't eat is a lie that they've been told, right? That in fact, a whole lot of stuff that we do has nothing to do with food production, and yet we all eat.

**Speaker B:** True, true.

**Speaker A:** And so when we disconnect that, we can recognize that there's other ways of living. The Buddha has the Four Requisites. Now when we say requisites, we're talking about requirements, we're talking about kind of a baseline of poverty. Below that line of poverty, there is some built-in Dukkha. The human being just does not fare well in poverty. An example of that is rough terrain and no shoes. Right.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** But very few people in the West are at that level of poverty, but many of them don't have adequate housing, many of them don't have adequate food, many of them don't have adequate medical attention at all. And the way that they're dressed, they generally don't have adequate clothing. So these are the four requisites, and the way that we want to look at it is in the sense of whatever station in life that we've come to at this particular point of view, or particular point in time, we could get by on less material goods.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Q] True.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:LAROUCHE] We could get by on the standard of living that we've had, and in fact that's something that I personally experimented with, to find just the right balance, so that the whole family, quite a number of us in fact, there's not so many people living in the house right now, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6— 6 of us are living here in a house that's not— it's about $250 a month. That includes water, electricity, because there's no air conditioning, there's no heating. And so it's actually quite cheap living, but you have to kind of be careful with finding the right kind of place. So that you can get free room and board, or at least something that's pretty close to that, so that we can reduce the amount of expenses that we have. But we need to do that happily, knowing what our bottom line is, knowing that yes, I can only stay in a tent for just a few days. And then I'm going to need something better than that, right? I can only be a bear and shit in the woods for so many days, and after that I want a toilet,

**Speaker B:** right?

**Speaker A:** But when we find our bottom line, then we can begin to shoot for— well, if that's the bottom line, then I don't need any, uh, income that is higher than that. And what I've come to find out for myself now is, is that the annuities and the Social Security that I have is more than enough. So that we actually put away money every month. I put away more money every month than I spend every month.

**Speaker B:** That's great. That's good.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's all— I don't know, nothing special about it because all that money will be there when I die. The only possibility of ever needing that money is the United States stopped doing Social Security, and that's possible. It is possible that they can get so greedy that they want even to take the money from the elderly and make 75- and 80-year-old people work with no job to do and no productivity. But at least we got them back working again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they're definitely working on that. They do that with the property taxes too. So people pay their stuff off and they're finally free, and then they keep bump everything up so that it's like, oh, I gotta go work a job now just to go pay the taxes on the house I paid off 20 years ago.

**Speaker A:** And in fact, all they need to do is move out of that house.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, I mean, in the U.S., I don't know, there's— it's a little rough because where are you going to go if you move out of that house, you know?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, um, it has to do with the mentality of the people. An example of that is so many people are looking at tiny houses now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there are— you gotta have land though. You gotta, you gotta have a place to put it though.

**Speaker A:** That's the thing, right? Yeah, but, uh, a very, very small plot of land is very, very cheap, but the, um, the zoning is such that that may be hard to do.

**Speaker B:** That's— yeah, that's exactly— yeah, they won't let you put it there. That's the other issue.

**Speaker A:** Well, all of the zoning laws have come to the point that the zoning laws are actually a part of the mentality of I'm stuck. But you can in fact find ways around even the zoning laws.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, if you put it on a— you got to put it on a movable object. Usually that's how they do it. That's how you get around it. It can't be on a permanent structure. I've looked into it. I wanted to put one in my backyard, one of those. They're really, they're really cool, those little houses. You could do that with the containers too, you know. The— you could buy— well, I don't know, I think they've gone up now, but the— all the shipping containers, used to be able to buy a used one for $2,000. Drop that in your backyard, it's completely airtight.

**Speaker A:** I mean, well, by the time they sell them used for $2,000, they're not airtight anymore.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, probably not. But yeah, I mean, you could seal it back up and, you know, it's no problem.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, because those containers are designed to have 8, 10, and 12 of them full of goods stacked on top of each other.

**Speaker B:** So yeah, yeah, they're pretty sturdy.

**Speaker A:** And so that's why they sell off the used ones. And in fact, there's a place in Thailand that is just— it's a huge area, maybe a huge square mile of nothing but— and they're disarranged. I mean, they were just dumped there. They weren't organized at all.

**Speaker B:** Oh, they just dump them.

**Speaker A:** They just dump them because the Thai people haven't figured out that they can make houses out of them yet.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. And you can make pools out of them. There's all kinds of stuff, you know, really cool stuff. Really cool stuff.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's all again about the recycling, that in fact a lot of people, uh, live quite well, uh, easy living, an easy life, by just recycling a few things that come to them easy enough, right? So, um, the whole idea of if you don't work, you don't eat— that is built into the, uh, the legal system, the zoning laws, the taxation laws. Everything is designed to keep you busy and keep you working so that somebody else could make some money off of your labor. Right, right. But we aren't taught that in school. What we're taught is to fit in, go along to get along, go to get a job that you don't like. That's, that's a requirement, right? Okay, so, um, if you can remember that you can not have to work right this very moment If you can remember that you can relax right now, that if you can remember that you can be satisfied for a little while and come out of the greed of wanting to remember everything, you can just remember one thing, and that is: I remember enough. I remember to be happy. That's the difference. That's why the teaching of the Buddha is so radical. Is because in a way it will destroy— if people, enough of people understand it and start to practice it, it will destroy the gross national product. That, that, uh, it will destroy the zoning laws because nobody pays any attention to the zoning laws. You don't have to take the zoning law off the book, you just ignore it.

**Speaker B:** Right, well, you do got to watch out for— you got to watch out for the jackboots that'll come in though when you ignore stuff in the U.S.

**Speaker A:** Well, the guys who were wearing the jackboots though, they're part of that society, and that it has to do with being able to make friends with everyone. So when the jackboots come, they're probably not— that the jackboots coming is probably a story that you've been told that you believe in, but very, very jackboots come onto property. They're too busy being out on the highway molesting people driving around.

**Speaker B:** That's true. Yeah, well, that is profitable because that's

**Speaker A:** really, really profitable, harassing you because you've got a shed in the backyard. Yeah, or that there's too many people living in the house.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Well, it does seem to me that they're moving in that direction though, where they— because there seems to be a huge push to, you know, have everything go to plant-based stuff because the margins are huge. You know, you could sell, you know, 10 cents worth of grains for, you know, $2 when you package it right. Whereas, you know, something like, you know, beef or whatever has a very low, you know, margin and it It's pretty intensive to create. So, you know, there's a huge push on, you know, not having— you know, people can't have, you know, a goat in their backyard for milk or whatever because, you know, whatever, it's breaking some regulation or something. So, you know, the simple things like that.

**Speaker A:** Uh, I don't know of a goat, but I do know that the neighbor over here has a pig, and the ones back there have chickens. Uh, I don't know why that had happened of getting animals out of the city. India is just fine with animals in the city. They've got sacred cows. Oh yeah, yeah, okay. It has to do with this control issue of we want to keep everybody poor and dependent upon the economy. You got to go get a job. You can't just have a chicken in your backyard.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, can't— you got to go to a store to get everything.

**Speaker A:** You got to go to a store. We'll see, people are beginning to figure that out, that that's backwards, right? That in fact we can have a garden,

**Speaker B:** right?

**Speaker A:** That we can just relax and enjoy our lives, that we don't have to keep struggling and striving, right?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** But the problem though with everyone like yourself is that we don't remember the right things. That you're trying to remember everything in order to get your to-do list, when in fact the right thing to remember is that you could relax and forget about the to-do list for a little while. Maybe not permanently, but if you get used to forgetting about it for a while, maybe the next time you can forget about it a little while longer. Maybe you can go all day without worrying about that to-do list. Take the day off. Yeah, maybe take a week off. You don't have to worry about that to-do list. Did you stop putting— yeah, okay. So that's what you can start looking for, is to say, can you remember to not put stuff on the to-do list? Can you remember to keep your to-do list empty? Or at least right now, at least for this very moment, let me at least remember right now I can take a deep breath and just relax. And we need to practice that over and over and over throughout the day so that you can come down to about 10 or 6 times a day, you can actually relax and get rid of that to-do list for about 5 or 10 minutes. You can just forget all about it and just enjoy the moment. This is the practice of Anapanasati, is to remember to take the right effort to throw that to-do list out of the mind for a moment and to take a deep breath and relax. Everything's okay, everything is fine, I'm satisfied with this present moment, all is good. That's what we need to remember, right?

**Speaker B:** Now, if things pop into your mind while you're doing, you know, taking that moment, the best thing to do would just to— is that why you go back to the breath? Because it's such a basic low-level thing, you say, well, This is the breath is good.

**Speaker A:** It is. It's an excellent anchor. And you can see that at the baseline, when you're sitting or laying in bed and doing absolutely nothing, the body's not moving or anything. The only thing that the body is doing is breathing, and it's doing it right here, right now. So that would be what we mean then by the baseline, is to pay attention to the reality of the situation. And the reality of the situation is this human body is laying here breathing, or sitting here breathing. Okay, and so then we can begin to build the Sati in the sense of this breath, this is a life-giving long in-breath, and it's delicious. If you don't think that an in-breath is delicious, Try going 5 or 10 minutes without one. And then when you take that breath, it really will be delicious.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you're right about that. The— I did the— Wim Hof has a breathing thing where he has you do 40 really, really deep breaths, and then he has you do a breath hold, and you can hold your breath a lot longer, I guess, because your body gets oxygenated from, you know, basically hyperventilating. And, um, you know, you can hold it for probably almost 2 minutes, really, um, which is kind of amazed me because if I try to hold my breath now, I could do it for maybe 20 seconds. But, um, but when you take that deep breath after that, oh my God, it's, it's, it's exactly what you said. It's like heavenly. Amazing.

**Speaker A:** Yes. All right, so now that you know that, you can begin to practice that little bit of heaven every time you remember to take a long, deep in-breath. Oh, that's so nice. And then we can sigh and relax. Okay, so that breathing in and out with Sati on the in-breath to remember to take a long breath, to remember to enjoy it, to remember to pay attention to it. And then on that out-breath to remember to let it be a long out-breath that is relaxing. So as you breathe out, you relax, and everything is good. In and out and easy. And you'll do that for a few minutes, and then you'll forget all about it and go off and do something else. But the fact that we did that put us in a much better state than if we had not been doing it at all.

**Speaker B:** Right, right.

**Speaker A:** And pretty soon that they start to collect so that you're just sitting at your desk looking at some piece of paper, and then all of a sudden you remember to take a long deep breath. And pretty soon they become connected. This is why we want to practice it many times during the day, is so that they'll begin to connect between those times. If we only do it once a day, then we're not building up the habit because we're then spending another 20 3 hours of bad habit rather than over and over and over again. We keep coming back to, I'm okay, keep coming back to everything is all right. Wow, what a nice deep breath this is. Not a care in the world right now. So we begin to work on coming out of that, I don't like it, or I'm in misery, into I've got this wired. Everything is good, everything is okay, I'm satisfied, things are fine. But our whole society teaches us to stay dissatisfied. Why? Because you cannot be manipulated if you're satisfied. The charlatans have known for years and years and years is that you cannot rob an honest man. What they mean by that is, is that if somebody is not interested in the greed that you're offering him then he's not going to invest in your sham company. It's only because he's greedy that he's willing to give you the money so that he can get a return on his investment. If you're already satisfied, then you'll look very closely at that charlatan to recognize this isn't the charlatan here. But those can't see the charlatan because their greed is blinding them. They want something, and that wanting is more important than anything else to them. This is why charlatans are in business, have been for many centuries, and will continue right along.

**Speaker B:** That's the basis of all sales. First find out what the pain is, find the pain, and keep poking it till you— and then present your product.

**Speaker A:** Isn't it interesting that when you say that That reminds me that there is actually— it's in the Great Bodhi, in the Buddha's exposition of the Eightfold Noble Path, where he's talking about right livelihood, that buying and selling is an item. All right, what we mean by that is, is that it's not— let us say, the way that the monks would do that is the monks do a bit of buying But, and in fact, most people, we do a whole lot more buying than we do selling. Once you buy something, you bring it home and you keep it long enough that it's worn out and broken, and then nobody wants it. And so you take it out to the street. You've probably done that with easy chairs before. Yep, right. There's not much of a market for used easy chairs.

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker A:** So The point, though, is that we're not talking about buying is wrong and selling is wrong. What we're talking about is business, the art of buying and selling, of buying for a low price and selling it for a high price. The Buddha would consider that, let us say, not noble. It's not a high-quality business. Because we're lying to people. We're poking, we're trying to find out what the need is, find out where their pain is, so that we can lie to them and tell them that this product will feel your pain,

**Speaker B:** right?

**Speaker A:** And he buys a product and pays you the money, and he goes off, and now he's got both the product and his pain.

**Speaker B:** Well, I think some products do solve some of the pain that people think they have, but probably not the underlying pain, like, you know, right?

**Speaker A:** That if you in fact buy that new car because you needed the transportation, but what you bought is the bad feelings of the first scratch, the repair bills, and the mortgage on that car, right? That the car hasn't made you feel good yet, right? It maybe did the day you bought it, but the month after you bought it, now it's an obligation, not a blessing. That's what happens with all the merchandise, though. Everything you buy and everything you eat turns to shit. When we get used to that, then we say, yeah, but that's the way that things are. Therefore, if I want something, I should be careful about what I want because it's the wanting that causes the problem. And if I didn't— if I stopped wanting it, then that's the same as getting it and having to deal with the fact that I bought it, I've had to pay for it, and now I've got to deal with the fact that it's rusting and falling apart. If I didn't want it in the first place, I was good to go. But if I wanted it, now look at all the trips I've got to go find it. I've got to buy it. I probably got lied to when I bought it. I'm unhappy with it. I'm unhappy with the dealer and all these bad feelings. And I could have been friends with that dealer if I hadn't bought anything from him, but they didn't want anything.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I tell that to my wife all the time. I said maintenance is like the downside of modern life. Everything has to be maintained. They spend all your time maintaining things.

**Speaker A:** Precisely. And that's especially true if the maintenance has to do when the things are disorganized. If things are very, very highly organized, then the maintenance is a whole lot easier. And one of the best ways to organize things is to have that space where that item would be empty. Now that's organization.

**Speaker B:** Don't even have it.

**Speaker A:** Don't even bother with it. Exactly. Okay, so back to this whole talk that we've been having about memory. The whole idea then is to be careful about what you're going to remember, okay? Because normally we want to remember everything. Oh, I learned it and I should remember it. But that's just setting us up for feeling bad. That you can say that, oh well, I remember enough, because in fact you have remembered enough. You're still alive. You haven't forgotten how to breathe.

**Speaker B:** You haven't still wake up in the morning.

**Speaker A:** You haven't forgotten to wake up in the morning. You haven't forgotten to go pee,

**Speaker B:** right?

**Speaker A:** So you've already— you've remembered the important things. That's a way of looking at it. Well, I've got all the good stuff wired down. I don't have to remember everything, but I do have to remember what to remember, what's enough to remember.

**Speaker B:** It's like a meta-memory.

**Speaker A:** Precisely. That's what Sati is, is kind of a meta-memory, to remember to look at what you're doing right now, to remember to evaluate, is that The desire to remember that thing is causing me trouble right now. Why don't I stop wanting to remember that and just sit and enjoy the moment? I'll think of it later.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I noticed that Buddhism seems like that's really intuitive. Intuitive knowledge of our executive brain function, really, is a lot of it's about. It's like You know, using that to look at the lower functions and organize

**Speaker A:** it kind of almost precisely so that you could say that in fact there are three areas of the brain. And because of that, there are three areas of the mind. And because of that, that means that we have three different ego states or three different ways of doing things. Number one, the baseline is what they call the reptilian brain. That takes care of the bodily functions like digesting the food and the heart beating and that kind of stuff, but it's also the point of all of your motor movements. The example that I would use would be the example of an alligator. The brain that the human has is similar to, or at least part of the brain of the human, the anterior cortex, is very, very similar to the alligator's brain in its structures and its functions and everything. The only thing that's different is the cerebellum on the human is much bigger, but other than that, all of that stuff is there, which means that anything that you can do that an alligator can do, you do it with the same part of the brain that the alligator does it. Falling around, wagging our tails, eating, opening our eyes, seeing, breathing, that kind of stuff is all done with the reptilian part of the brain. But there's something that the reptiles cannot do, and that is that they do not herd together. They don't rest together. They do not have any cooperation. That every alligator is on his own. That when you woke up as a baby, baby, baby alligator, that's because you popped out of a shell that was in the sand, and mommy is no place in sight, and you're getting nothing of training from her. But humans and mammals that have live birth We have a different part of the brain for mommy to nurture the young. That nurturing of the young becomes the nesting instinct, and that nesting instinct then comes with rules in the sense of who owns the place sets the rules. Um, daddy tells the teenage daughter, if you're going to dress like that, you can't live in my house. Right? So that's that nesting instinct there. And guess what? Our entire society is built upon that. If you don't follow the rules, we're going to take you out of society, maybe kill you or put you in prison or send you, deport you someplace else or whatever. But if you're going to be in this nest, you're going to have to follow these rules.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, excommunication. Goodbye.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, that's what— and every child learns that, that you've got to learn your ABCs so that you can learn to so that you can get good grades in school, so that you can get a degree, so you can get a job, so that you can work. And we teach our kids that their whole lives.

**Speaker B:** True.

**Speaker A:** But we don't teach the kids, hey man, you're okay like you are, you're good enough just right now, aren't you having fun in your life? We don't teach that to our kids. A very few of the kids are taught that. Very few kids are taught that you're okay even if you didn't make an A on that test. True, it was okay that you made a C. Did you enjoy the test? So we've got all of these social pressures that are put on every one of us as children, and almost all of them are artificial. Not necessary. Some of them are downright necessary. In other words, we have to teach the kids to behave themselves long enough for them to gain the wisdom to recognize that they have to behave themselves for their own sake rather than because they're following the rule. So we give the kids rules in the first place. The problem is that most of humanity remains rule-bound for the rest of their life because of this midsection of the brain that we call the temporal cortex of the mammalian brain, which is the source of all the rules, all the ways of things that are supposed to do. How do we fit in? The herding instinct, with the understanding that if you are in the middle of the herd, you're more safe than if you were on the outside of the herd. This is what gives us status and organization and wanting to be the top dog. Why? Because the idea instinctually is that the top dog is the most safe because he's got everybody around him to protect him. The reality of the situation is everybody wants to be a top dog, and if you're the top dog, you're the target now. And being the top dog is in fact the most unsafe thing that you can do.

**Speaker B:** Everyone's gunning for you.

**Speaker A:** Everybody's gunning for us because everybody else has the same instinct that you do of wanting to be the top dog. And because of it, our society becomes dangerous. So if we can remember Sati, that you're okay right now, that you don't have to compete, that you don't have to show yourself up better than somebody else, that you just relax for the moment. That's when you're beginning to get real value out of the teaching of the Buddha, is when you can actually enjoy the moment, to remember that right now is okay. Right now is fine. All of my problems and all of my worries are either in the past or in the future, but right now everything is all right. We have to remember that. That's what we need to remember.

**Speaker B:** That's going to be the, uh, the work for this week.

**Speaker A:** Okay, just remember, tie a string around your finger, tattoo a crucifix on your shoulder or something, but remember Remember to take a deep breath and relax. And in that relaxing, that means to throw out all of the hindrances. Aha, I see you, anxiety. Aha, I see that invoice. It popped right through the mind. It just popped through, but I don't have to have anxiety because I remember that invoice. I can say, never mind, I'll pay it later. It's okay. No problem. This is the thing to remember. That's the important thing. So today we've talked about basic things— that we don't remember things well because we don't remember them, uh, because we didn't learn it in the first place, we weren't paying really close attention, that we don't keep track of things, or we're not organized very well, and so when we need something, we can't find it inside the mind because it doesn't have its associations in place to find it. And then, at the time when we have to drag it out, that's when we don't remember, we can't find it because it wasn't organized, but when we don't remember the first moment, that means that now we start to feel instead of searching our memory, we're in bad feeling, right? Oh, I can't remember. So now is the time to actually remember the important thing, and that is, oh, I don't have to get confused and beat myself up because I don't remember something. I'm okay. Maybe I'll remember it 5 minutes from now. I don't have to remember it right now. I'm okay. Everything is all right right now. So that's what we have to remember over and over again. That's why I recommend practicing it 6 times a day.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna start setting some timers so I can, you know, do the 6, 6, uh, 6 times.

**Speaker A:** All right, here's something you can do. You got 4 fingers, that's enough on 2 hands that you can tie up, uh, 6 fingers. You put a little tie on on 6 fingers, and every time you remember to take a deep breath, you can pull a string off and say, okay, I got that. So there's little techniques that we can use, anchors, memory bubbles, and the breath is supposed to be the big one to remember because the breath is always there to remind you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it is a nice— it makes things easy because you don't have to really— you know, it's always going to be there.

**Speaker A:** It's always going to be there. So good luck with this, Christian.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Remember, remember, remember that all you have to do is just take a deep breath and relax. That's enough. That's all you need to remember is to be happy.

**Speaker B:** I appreciate it, Dhammarato. I'll be working on this this week and enjoying it while I'm doing it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly. Enjoy. So we'll see you later, Chris. This has been a really good talk. I've really enjoyed our conversation. Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. Bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) in conversation with a Sangha friend (Speaker B), uses the topic of **memory and forgetfulness** as a gateway to explore core Buddhist teachings on **sati (mindfulness), attitude, and liberation from dukkha (suffering)**.

Here is a structured summary of the key points:

### **Core Problem: The Anxiety of Forgetting**
The discussion begins with Speaker B's anxiety about forgetting important things at crucial moments (like an exam). Dhammarato reframes this common worry as a profound opportunity for Dhamma practice.

### **1. The Three Stages of Memory & Where It Goes Wrong**
Dhammarato breaks memory into three stages, each prone to error:
*   **Input:** We often don't learn/absorb information well because we **lack interest or curiosity**. If we're not interested, we don't pay close attention.
*   **Storage/Organization:** We store information poorly—as disjointed facts rather than integrating it into a **meaningful context or framework** (like organizing files on a computer).
*   **Retrieval:** When we need the information, we fail to recall it. Often, this isn't because it's gone, but because the **retrieval process is clouded by emotional baggage** (anxiety, fear of failure).

### **2. The Deeper Issue: Emotional Baggage vs. Sati**
The real problem isn't forgetfulness itself, but our **emotional reaction** to it (regret, self-criticism, anxiety).
*   We store memories with emotional labels (e.g., "painful," "stressful"), so a mere flash of the memory triggers bad feelings, which then hijack our attention.
*   **Sati (Mindfulness)** is the solution: not memory of facts, but **"meta-memory"**—the ability to remember to be aware **right now**. It means remembering to observe your present attitude and emotional state.

### **3. The Central Teaching: Attitude is Everything**
Dhammarato repeatedly emphasizes that **attitude** is the key at all three memory stages:
*   **During Input:** Cultivate **curiosity and interest**. Consciously choose what is worth learning.
*   **During Organization:** Consciously **fit information into a coherent context**.
*   **During Retrieval:** Approach tasks (like a test) with **confidence and calm**, not fear. If you forget something, the mindful attitude is: *"It's okay. I don't have to remember everything. I'll come back to it or do my best now."*

### **4. Practical Application to Daily Life**
*   **The To-Do List Trap:** Speaker B confesses to having an overwhelming to-do list. Dhammarato points out this stems from **greed/desire** (wanting to do/accomplish too much) and **fear** (of forgetting). The list becomes a source of dissatisfaction.
*   **The Invoice Example:** A flash of an unpaid invoice triggers anxiety. The practice is to **decouple the action** (paying it) from the **emotional reaction** (dread). You can choose to pay it *and feel good* about being responsible, or schedule it for later *without feeling bad*.
*   **The Breath as Anchor:** The practice of **Ānāpānasati** (mindfulness of breathing) is the foundational tool. The breath is always available to bring you back to the present, where you can remember: **"Right now, I am okay. I can take a deep breath and relax."**

### **5. Radical Re-framing: Remember What Truly Matters**
Dhammarato extends the insight to challenge societal conditioning:
*   We are taught to strive, achieve, and remember countless things to be "successful."
*   The Buddha's radical teaching is to **remember that you are enough right now**. The goal is to cultivate **satisfaction** (*santutthi*), not to accumulate accomplishments or memories.
*   He critiques the societal mantra "if you don't work, you don't eat," arguing it keeps people in a cycle of dissatisfaction and greed. True peace comes from **lowering desires and finding contentment with simplicity**.

### **6. Final Advice & Practice**
*   **Shift what you remember:** Instead of trying to remember everything, remember to **be aware of your present-moment attitude and choose satisfaction**.
*   **Frequent Practice:** Don't just meditate once a day. Practice short moments (10-15 minutes) of mindful breathing **5-6 times daily** to let the calm "seep into" daily life.
*   **The Ultimate Memory:** Remember that **your baseline state can be one of ease**. When a worrying thought flashes, use Sati: *"Ah, there's that thought. But right now, I am breathing. Right now, I am okay."*

**In essence,** this talk transforms a common worry about forgetfulness into a masterclass on using mindfulness to change one's relationship with experience. The path is to remember to observe without judgment, to organize one's mind with wisdom instead of fear, and to repeatedly return to the peaceful, satisfied awareness that is always available in the present breath.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this talk, here is a comprehensive list of the **metaphors and stories** used by Speaker A (Dhammarato) to illustrate his points about memory, attention, and satisfaction:

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **The Exam / Pop Quiz:** The central, extended metaphor for life.
    *   Life is a daily "pop quiz in every class."
    *   Forgetting something important is like a student blanking on a test question due to anxiety.
    *   The ideal approach is to walk into life's tests thinking, "I've got this wired."

2.  **The Computer / File System:** A primary metaphor for how the mind organizes information.
    *   The mind is like a disorganized hard drive or directory.
    *   Proper learning is like **filing data in organized folders** (e.g., "Western movies," "Ajahn Chah's teachings," "chick flicks").
    *   Poor memory is a **"lousy retrieval"** system, not necessarily bad storage.
    *   A cluttered house with 75 pairs of pants is analogous to a cluttered mind.

3.  **The Invoice:** A recurring metaphor for unresolved tasks and associated anxiety.
    *   A flash of an unpaid invoice in the mind triggers bad feelings.
    *   The key is to separate the *action* (paying/not paying) from the *feeling* about it (dread/relief).
    *   Used to illustrate the "see-feel" reaction cycle.

4.  **The Quadrant / Graph:** A conceptual model for separating action from attitude.
    *   **Vertical axis:** Do it / Don't do it.
    *   **Horizontal axis:** Like it / Don't like it.
    *   This creates four quadrants of experience (e.g., "do it and feel bad" = most common; "don't do it and feel good" = goal).

5.  **The Three Brains / Ego States:** A metaphor for human psychology and social conditioning.
    *   **Reptilian Brain:** Handles basic functions and instincts (like an alligator).
    *   **Mammalian (Limbic) Brain:** Handles herding, rules, nesting, and social status ("top dog").
    *   **Human (Prefrontal) Cortex:** Capable of wisdom, satisfaction, and breaking free from social conditioning.
    *   Society trains us to live in the "mammalian" rule-bound state, while Buddhism aims for the wise, satisfied human state.

6.  **The Short Pencil vs. Long Memory:** A classic adage repurposed.
    *   "A short pencil is better than a long memory" means **write it down** (use calendars, to-do lists).
    *   The speaker acknowledges this but argues it doesn't solve the underlying emotional problem (anxiety about forgetting).

7.  **The Breath as an Anchor / Baseline:** A foundational meditation metaphor.
    *   The breath is the "baseline" reality of the present moment.
    *   It's an "excellent anchor" to return to when the mind is cluttered.
    *   Taking a conscious breath is like a "little bit of heaven," a direct way to access satisfaction.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Dog vs. The Human Couple:**
    *   **Story:** A dog punished at 9 AM is in your lap by noon, having forgotten. A husband and wife who fight at 9 AM are angry all day.
    *   **Point:** Questions what is "worthy" of remembering and suggests that forgetting can sometimes lead to more peace.

2.  **The Man in a Hurry to the Bathroom:**
    *   **Story:** A man sets down his keys and phone on the way to the toilet and immediately forgets where he put them.
    *   **Point:** Illustrates how a singular, urgent intention (getting to the bathroom) destroys attention/memory for other actions.

3.  **The Fisherman and the Tycoon:**
    *   **Story:** A tycoon tells a resting fisherman to work harder to buy a motor, get more fish, become rich, and *then* relax. The fisherman replies, "I'm already relaxed."
    *   **Point:** Critiques the societal "deferred happiness" model and champions present-moment satisfaction.

4.  **The Father and the PhD in Misery:**
    *   **Story:** A father browbeats his daughter to get a good education so she'll have a good life. She ends up with a "PhD in Misery."
    *   **Point:** Highlights how "wanting the best for someone" (a long to-do list of desires for them) can backfire if it's not rooted in wanting their fundamental happiness/satisfaction.

5.  **Personal Anecdote - From Sloppy Kid to Organized Computer Scientist:**
    *   **Story:** The speaker describes his own childhood disorganization and how managing millions of computer files taught him the critical importance of organizational systems for the mind.
    *   **Point:** Organization is a learnable skill that is crucial for both physical items and mental data.

6.  **Personal Anecdote - IBM Suits vs. Current Life:**
    *   **Story:** He used to have a closet full of suits and stained white shirts for his IBM job. Now he owns none of those.
    *   **Point:** Demonstrates how shedding societal "requisites" (and the jobs needed to afford them) leads to a simpler, more satisfied life.

7.  **The "Laying Down" Movement in China (996):**
    *   **Reference:** Briefly mentions the modern Chinese youth rebellion against the "996" work culture (9 am-9 pm, 6 days a week).
    *   **Point:** Used as modern evidence that the mantra "if you don't work, you don't eat" is a societal control mechanism, not a natural law.

### **Key Symbolic References**

*   **Sati (Mindfulness):** Framed as **"meta-memory"**—the memory of *how* to remember, or the process of remembering to pay attention to the present.
*   **Murphy's Law:** Referenced humorously to describe the fear that learning/remembering will fail "at the worst possible moment."
*   **Weed Whacker:** The opening ambient noise is used as a metaphor for the constant distractions of the world that the practice ("noise-canceling microphone" of meditation) helps to manage.

**Overall Theme of the Metaphors:** The speaker consistently uses tangible, everyday images (files, tests, invoices, breath) to explain abstract mental processes. The stories contrast societal conditioning with a path to wisdom, often using irony (the fisherman, the father) to highlight the flaws in conventional thinking.
