### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Well, so welcome everybody to the UK Sangha. It's Sunday morning. We can call it worship service or change it slightly into warship service. And that We have just been starting on talking about the Bhavana method and basically how it's evolved over time and how it fits into Anapanasati. So take over, over to you. Oh, I can't get that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the knees, the knees, the bee's knees.

**Speaker A:** The niche. So you were saying?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so in the Goenka course they introduced this topic of Sankhara and they say that we must purify the mind by removing the Sankhara out of the mind-body phenomena. You know, so Samsara is our formation.

**Speaker A:** That's precisely correct. Absolutely.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And when do you do that? When did they teach you not to do that?

**Speaker B:** Well, the process of dissolving Samskaras is mostly from observation with equanimity. Right.

**Speaker A:** So, okay. Right. Then you observe.

**Speaker C:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Interesting.

**Speaker A:** I'd love to hear the Well, the correct way. But before that, you mentioned about the nostrils and the nose tip.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, I was— here's, yes.

**Speaker A:** For everyone, and that is that the nose or anything like it is not mentioned in the Anapanasati Sutta, which is the sutta about Mindfulness of breathing, which is what Goenka's method is based upon, though he talks more about the Satipatthana. But the scanning is all, let us call it, a very formalized way of doing step 3 of Anapanasati, of mindfully breathing in, experiencing the body, and mindfully breathing out, experiencing the body. Right, okay. So there is no nose tip in there. The next one is, is to relax the body, which is the whole point of experiencing the body, is so that it can be relaxed. And so there's no nose tip anywhere in the suttas, and most especially it's not in the Anapanasati Sutta, which is the top dog of the In fact, here's one thing: Bhikkhu Buddhadasa kind of got into a bit of trouble by saying that the Buddha only taught one kind of meditation, because we've got those old books that say that there's 40. No doubt you've heard of the 40, which also includes Metta and the Brahmabhavanas, and it includes the trauma-bound meditations and a whole bunch of other stuff like that coming up with 40 Heads. Uh, anybody not heard about these, right? The casinos, they're in there also. And guess what? That list was made up long later than, uh, the Sutras, but it's crept into modern Buddhism. But the Buddha only taught one kind of meditation, and that one meditation is the Anapanasati practice of the Eightfold Noble Path. And so everything has to be tied back to the basic skills that are developed on the Eightfold Noble Path, and that's the connection that Bhikkhu Arhat's method is missing. Though they talk about it, they talk about it loosely, than figuring out that the Eightfold Noble Path is taking these items on the path and deeply developing them with the Satipatthana. And the method is through Anapanasati. So in the sutta it says that we practice Anapanasati for the fulfillment of the Satipatthana, and we fulfill the Satipatthana for then the fulfillment of the Sambhojana. Now the Sambhojana here strikingly resembles the Eightfold Noble Path itself, but the way that the Sambhojana, or the Seven Factors of Enlightenment, is stated, is that this is the fulfillment of the path. In other words, we start on the path, but when that path is fulfilled, it becomes the very factors of enlightenment. And that we practice these Seven Factors of Enlightenment through the Eightfold Noble Path, to bring about knowledge and deliverance. So this knowledge and deliverance, actually in English language, we can say that that's the two kinds of enlightenment there is. One is, wake up to see what a burden you're carrying, and two, set it down. And we do that immediately, okay? And the burdens that we're often carrying is in the Pali is referred to as the Samskara, which is whatever crap that we've got in the mind right now. Just set it down right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so my question is— yeah, sorry. Yeah, just that cognitive process of setting it down, how can we explain that.

**Speaker A:** To All right, glad you asked. Step right up. What is the function?

**Speaker B:** Do you just do it? Is it incommunicable? Or like, you know, what is that mechanism? How do we intentionally set it down? Is it just intention?

**Speaker A:** Or if you stop asking, I'll answer. Okay, so imagine the color red. Everybody do this. Everybody, can you imagine the color red? Can you see red? It can be a red object or just the color red, or maybe a red on the side of a wall, or maybe a piece of paper. It doesn't matter. Can you see red? Everybody nod or give me a thumbs up or whatever when you can see some red. Okay, everybody got some red?

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** All right, so gosh, the screen's been moved around. Oh, there you are. All right, now while you've got that red Set that aside and go for green. Can you see green in the mind? You know what the color green looks like, you've seen it outside many times. Can you see it on the inside? Can be forms or shapes, it can be leaves, it can be anything. Can you see the color green? Everybody nodding? Got anybody who can't tell green yet? Okay, I did for a bit, but.

**Speaker B:** Then the mind wandered.

**Speaker A:** All right, but you came back to the green and you got some more green. If you could talk about green and see the green. Okay, and that's a good point. Now we can't in fact avoid the red, but there might be a little creps of red coming in, but we can stay with the green. Now what I've actually done now is I've actually introduced to you a concept of going back into the red when in fact we can receive that coming back and see that our green is being colored. And now we can come back to the green again. Everybody back to green. Okay, congratulations, everyone here has a human mind that functions correctly. Yippee-ki-yay! It works! You can change your mind. Just recognize what you just did. You changed it from red to green. You changed your mind from red to green. Now all we have to do is determine which kind of thoughts are red and how to change them into green, and voilà, we've got it. You can see the Samskara as red thoughts. They're all garbage. Throw them out and replace them with something pleasant, something new, something green. And we do that with our breathing, taking a deep breath and congratulating ourselves. Now, this is actually the Eightfold Noble Path of the Buddha that we're talking about here. Starting with remembering to do this, and then check it out to see, are these thoughts red or are they green already? And if they're already green, there's nothing to do. Here we are, everything is hunky-dory. But if this thought is red, throw it out and replace it with a greenish thought. And when we do that, Over and over and over again, we begin to believe that we can actually do that, we can actually change the mind. And when we get really secure in doing it, because we've done it over and over again so many times, now we've got some real confidence growing. This is what is called Saddha or Shraddha in the Pali. It does not mean faith; this is not faith at all. This is observation over and over again. Remember, we just talked about making associations with the mind, or that the mind is a pattern matching machine. You start matching this pattern of you can brighten your mind, you can control your mind, you can control these thoughts and change them from red to green, because you keep doing it over and over again, and pretty good you get the idea, I can do this.

**Speaker B:** Is this not the same as trying to refocus on a meditation object before your mind wanders again and you keep bringing it back to the object?

**Speaker A:** Similar kind of objects are there. The body.

**Speaker B:** Well, sensorial objects. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well, wait a minute. That's one of the major teachings of the Buddha. That's one of the biggest things that he thought about when he changed it. In the old days, they had kasina meditation. They had fire meditations, they had water meditations, they had sky meditations. In fact, the sky meditations, or the air meditations, is what gives us meteorology, it gives us astronomy and astrology, all because people spent a whole lot of time in the time of the Buddha with nothing else left to do but just to look up. That's what they did back then. And you can go into really crazy mystical states by just sky gazing, or water gazing, or fire gazing. Fire gazing seems to be the easiest one of all. But this is what they did. And what Buddha did is he turned that around from the outside to the inside, and see the four elements on the inside. So we have the body that is solid, we have the feelings which are the water, we have the mind itself is the fire, and then the smoke that the mind gives off after it's burned things down is the objects of the mind. Or we can call it: Kaya Nupassana, Vedana Nupassana, Citta Nupassana, and Dhamma Nupassana. Anagami, and the way that we practice that, according to the Buddha, is with the Eightfold Noble Path, through this practice of working with the body of the breath and breathing. So that's it in a nutshell, at least the introduction to it. And there are several things in there that Blanca's practice is missing, and a few things he's added to it.

**Speaker D:** Can you still do the body scanning technique and do this at the same, you know, when you're doing the body scanning and you're having the thoughts and the red stuff come up and then you're going into the green stuff? What I've tried when I was doing the body scanning is when I was like going through the body with my awareness and then something red was happening, that if I was trying to put green in, then I would lose the awareness on the sensation in my body, you know. Does that make sense?

**Speaker A:** Yes, for someone who's not practicing correctly. And then asking questions about it is proof positive that that's not correct practice. Okay, okay, good. In fact, which one is more important in reality? That you keep your mind focused on some body part while your mind is rotting Or go put the fire out in your mind first? Which is more important to do? Put the fire out, I guess. Yeah, okay, all right. Yes, let's change the mind from red to green. And actually, the Buddha gave specific instructions on how to do that, that in fact, while he was under the bow tree, if you know that story, There is the time when, in fact, this is actually the key that pops in and puts the Paticcasamuppada, or in Thai they say Paticcasamuppada, which you call dependent origination, which is where the whole idea of Samsara has come from anyway. That he's got a key to that whole system with this one little phrase, and that is, "Aha, I got you, Mara! Aha, I see you!" Okay, what does that mean? It means in this discussion, I see that red, I see it. That's it, that's the Mara. Now, the Mara— in fact, you've heard of the magical story about Mara having three daughters. You know the three daughters of Mara? I haven't heard. Loba, Moha, Dosha are their names. Oh yeah, okay. Does that give a hint? Yeah, the three daughters of Mara are Greed, Ill Will, and Delusion.

**Speaker C:** I knew one of them was Greed, I just didn't know the other two.

**Speaker A:** Greed, Ill Will. In a way, Greed and Ill Will are exactly the same feeling. They're just which direction it's pointed at. But if you want something, then you want to get rid of its absence. If you're trying to put up with something that you don't like, then that means that you want relief from it. So in a way, greed and ill will are the same thing. If we can see that— pardon, I.

**Speaker B:** Was going to say, so when, when we're cleaning up the mind We're mostly talking about cleaning thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Good to see you. Go ahead. Welcome, welcome there.

**Speaker B:** I was just saying, when you talk about cleaning the Samskara, is changing from red to green, we're mostly trying to clean up thoughts then, or does that also apply to sensations on the body, or is it mostly just mental content?

**Speaker A:** Or activity, I suppose. Well, there is actually written right into the Anapanasati, one of the steps is to see the mind's condition, which means that there is a relationship in there. And basically what will happen, here's an example of that, of the cycle, is that somebody has a frightening thought, they get some anxiety, then they see that their anxiety and they know They know that they don't like anxiety and they want to get rid of anxiety, which just makes the anxiety worse. Why is that happening? It's because of the mind-body-feeling relationship, that they're all tied to one. You're one kind of unit together, but we can only see those connections by seeing the things separately, so that we can see the way that they're put back together, kind of like a jigsaw puzzle. Or maybe a Chinese wooden puzzle box. We've got to take the thing apart and then see how everything fits back together again, and then we can see these cycles. So when we can see these cycles, that means that we can draw back from them, because normally when we're on a cycle Whatever part of it that we like will change, and then we don't like the next part of the cycle, and then we get used to it for it only to change again, and round and around we go in liking and not liking. And if we can wisely step out of that and see this cycle of liking and not liking, then we can kind of put an end to it. Isn't there a track? Pardon?

**Speaker B:** That liking and not liking experience, can that be a trap of not liking or liking that?

**Speaker A:** Well, now we're beginning to work with your attitude to recognize that. Are you going to take on the attitude of a victim? Are you going to take on the attitude of a lion, a winner? That in fact, the attitude is the thing that gives the meaning to our thoughts. That in fact, in physical science and in engineering, we often refer to as an attitude, is something that's not perpendicular completely, having gravity only pull it down, but it has a type of leaning to it. Because the danger is, is that something, if it's going to fall, it's going to follow and fall in the direction that it's leaning, right?

**Speaker E:** This is this Chetana.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker E:** Chetana. Intention.

**Speaker A:** I, well, you could say yes, intention, but I didn't hear the word. The word that I know is the Samma Sanghappa. Ah. In the power.

**Speaker E:** Citta na, Citta na. I read it in the Buddha Dhamma.

**Speaker A:** Are you saying Vedana?

**Speaker F:** No.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Well, never mind, we'll put that aside right now, and we'll talk about Samskara. Which is— excuse me— sankhara. Sankhara is that attitude, or you could think of it as a single thought moment. One of the problems that we have with the words that are used in the Pali is that we will take English language words and then think that the Pali word means, because it's close, that that's exactly what it means. Normally when we use the word 'thought' in English, we refer to it as generally discursive thought, that has verbiage or talking to it. But in fact, there is quite a lot of thinking that is done, that is done, let us call it, observationally. In other words, if you say, "It's raining," well, how do you know? Because you took a little bit of time to figure out that it was raining before you ever said, "It is raining." And that's part of thinking also, and this is what we're actually looking at, is how does your mind lean? Which direction is it going? This is the attitude that you have. Can you actually begin to change your attitude from a loser's attitude to a winner's attitude? How do we do that? With success. One little success after another success after Another success after another success. What success is that? The feeling of being satisfied, which is the Pali word Sukkha, because Sukkha is the exact opposite of Dukkha, and Sukkha is step number 5 on 6 on the list on Anapanasati. Sukkha is a skill to be developed. How do we develop it? By gladdening the mind and by giving the body a lot of air, because we're actually beginning to control the breath, to do that mindfully, breathing in long and mindfully breathing out long. And so by doing that, we energize the body and we begin to feel good and we begin to experience feeling good, as well as telling ourselves that, "Hey, I don't have to have that Samskara to think about. I can think about whatever's happening right here, right now," which is actually quite interesting. This is how we begin to develop the first Jhana, is by getting the mind and the body unified, by getting the feelings good, by getting the mind together in wholesome thoughts, by getting the body relaxed. These are the features that bring about the first Jhana. All we had to do now is add that little extra thing called success. I'm talking about success and congratulations. I'm talking about what you would do if you had just made a Heisman Trophy kind of touchdown. How would you feel? What do they feel? Have you ever seen the way that these athletes feel when they actually make a spectacular goal of some kind? What do they do with their arms? They raise them in the air and cheer, "Yay! Yeah! All right! I can do it!" 'You can do it!' Right? That's the way we want to begin to feel about Anapanasati. We want to feel like a champion, like you can do this, like you're the boss now. This is the whole point of it, is can you change your attitude, can you unify your mind? Because when the mind is noble and wholesome, it's free from all of the garbage, like wanting If you've already got everything that you want, what more could you want? When are you going to become satisfied? And as long as we want things, that means we want to pick up and carry it, which makes it heavy. It's heavy before we even touch it because it's already on the mind, which carrying it around. And all we have to do is just set all that stuff down and be happy in this present moment. Anybody have any questions? Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Go ahead.

**Speaker C:** All right, my question is, what would you say is the most fundamental spiritual desire that most people have? Or like, what would the main satisfaction from spiritual processes be in people who seek them out?

**Speaker A:** Actually, you asked two questions, and the answer to that should be both of them. The first— the answer to the first question is that they're alive. That's what the word spirit means. You're alive already. And the second point is, is that people don't actually appreciate that very well. They're just going to be just saying that you're alive, get over it. You should actually be in the point of, yeah, I'm alive already, which is exactly the way that many people feel when they've had a near-death experience. They thought they were going to die and they woke up and they're still alive. Uh-huh. All right, well, why don't you you generate that for yourself, recognizing, hey, all that crap that I was into, at least I survived. So this feeling of life, of being free from all of the troubles that you've gone through, that you actually survived— wow, isn't that marvelous? You're still alive, you made it. Ah, and we can relax. So this is part of the practice that many of the teachers don't teach. This is Samma Sanghappa. We've got to get on top of our own world. In fact, one of the ways of saying it is, is that everyone is an emperor of their own pile of dirt. Every one of us is an emperor of our own pile of dirt. The question is, are you going to be buried under it? Are you going to be clawing your way to the top? Are you going to be sitting happily right on top of your own world? Your choice, because it's a mental attitude.

**Speaker C:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Don't thank me, this is Buddha talking. Not— I mean, this is sutras that we have to get this Samma Sanghappa going. We have to change it from the negative. We have to change it from the red to the green, and then it just keeps getting green. So, does anybody have any comments about this?

**Speaker E:** It's been a lot of fun.

**Speaker G:** Can you hear me okay?

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker G:** Can you hear me okay? The microphone isn't very good. I hope you can hear me.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I can hear you.

**Speaker G:** Okay. So, I was going to ask a question, kind of related to this. So, are there any tips for generating the positive attitude apart from taking deep breaths? So, I know a lot of people use like visualization, and stuff, they kind of visualize, you know, imposing— Exactly right.

**Speaker A:** There are all kinds of ways.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, my question is related to something particular. So I don't know if you've heard the term aphantasia, but there are people who have this thing, and it's basically a very diminished visual imagination. So it's very hard to like conjure up images. So when we did the exercise with the red and the green, I can conjure up the concepts, but not really the colors. So, it isn't very common, but it's like 1% of the population or something.

**Speaker A:** I tell you what, I see a lot of green right above your head. Turn around and look up.

**Speaker G:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** You see green.

**Speaker G:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Can you see it? Okay. Do you remember what it looks like now when you're not looking at it? Then look at it again. Turn around and look at it again. Yeah, okay. Can you remember it at least for now? This is kasina meditation, by the way.

**Speaker G:** I can do it while looking, but like, I then— if I close my eyes, I get like a flash of the image and then it disappears. So I guess with kasina practice, it kind of tends to stay for a while.

**Speaker A:** Make it a little bit longer next time. Open your eyes and see the green, and then close your eyes and keep the green, and then open the eyes and see the green, and then close the eyes and keep the green. It'll go away very quickly until you start practicing.

**Speaker E:** Daniel Ingram wrote a whole book about this.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's old stuff. It's not mine. I'm not dreaming this stuff up right now. I read those books he read, or something like it.

**Speaker G:** I was asking this in the context of like, you know, People who have a good visual imagination, they're able to like, you know, get a good feeling just about thinking, you know, imagining or remembering something that makes you feel— Wait.

**Speaker A:** A minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. You're— you just told me that you do not have a good skill at visualization.

**Speaker G:** Yes, exactly. So that's the problem, I cannot generate good feelings.

**Speaker A:** You are in a state of wanting something you don't have, is that correct? Yep, yep.

**Speaker G:** So I want a way to generate—.

**Speaker A:** Wait a minute, let's get into that a little bit. And instead of capitalizing on the skills that you do have and getting yourself into Samadhi, you're going to actually want and desire and cling to one skill that you know will get you into Samatha, but that you can't do that one very well? Oh for me. Let's all have a pity party for him.

**Speaker D:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Or you can figure out something that you are good at. That in fact, I can give you a list of things from various professions that will give a hint about like that, that I really like to have musicians. I really like to have mathematicians and engineers and even philosophers and psychologists. And I like those. Why? Because those are the kind of people that actually think and apply things. There's another group that I would like very much, and I have had some of those also, and that is martial artists. Why? Because martial artists know how to be here now, because otherwise in the ring, they're going to get their face smashed if they're not watching what's going on. And so they've already developed, uh, some skills they need, okay? Because if they can apply those skills to keep their face from being punched, then they can apply those skills to stop punching themselves in the head on the inside. Just a matter of changing it from the outside to the inside. So, I'm sure that you've got some skills that would be of enormous value to you. But you're thinking that you're at a loss, that you can't do it because of visualization. But in fact, there are probably times in your life that you felt really, really good. Do you remember any time in your life that you ever felt really, really good?

**Speaker G:** Yes, I do, but abstractly. So that's the core issue, that I cannot inhabit the memory.

**Speaker A:** Let's go for the abstract. Let's go for the best abstract that we can do and stay with that. Okay. Okay. Okay. Now, do you know any jokes? Surely. I mean, I tell jokes all the time.

**Speaker G:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Do you know any jokes?

**Speaker G:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Did you ever think that any of those jokes were ever funny?

**Speaker G:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Do you think that if you told yourself that joke now that you could think it was funny now?

**Speaker G:** Yep. There are some jokes that I always find funny.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, here we go. That's a skill. Yeah, the skill of telling a joke is quite rare, in fact. So congratulations, you've got a skill. You can tell yourself a joke.

**Speaker G:** I'm not, I'm not good at telling them, but I do enjoy them.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, you tell yourself the ones that you enjoy and then enjoy them, okay? And you can also remember things that have happened that you had joy from, so you know what joy is like. You've had it before. You wouldn't have been alive if you'd never had any joy. And if you claim that you've never had any joy, you're just in a state of denial, which happens often. But everybody's had joy before. And so, to delight the mind means to go back into that state, to lighten up, to find some joy. Because only it's through the lightening up that we're actually going to get down to the actual development of the Sukkha. Sukkha has a particular definition. And that definition is, is that it has to do with safety and security. So wherever you are, do you feel safe and secure there? If not, then let's look at that first, because that's one of the most basics to recognize, that in fact we can tell ourselves about it, then in fact there are no um, let us say large animals under the, uh, clothing that we're wearing right now, other than the one that you want there. Okay, that there are no pythons circling your feet, there are no tarantula spiders on the keyboard, right? So we can— and you can actually hear the, the joke and the joy in this. Well, Of course there's not any of that stuff. Of course there's not a boogeyman under the bed, huh? But when we're kids, we can imagine all kinds of things, and just a split-second thought's enough to turn us into, uh, rubble. So we have to actually think our way through it and recognize that we actually are safe. Does anybody here now not feel safe? Does everybody here already feel safe enough? Don't feel safe now, there's no reason to proceed. Everybody's feeling pretty safe, okay, safe and secure. The next item on the list is the one that's really hard for a lot of Goenka students, and that is to get comfortable, because their comfort has to do with what kind of postures they can get into and sit in and how long they can sit there. And they can strongly determine how to keep posture. But the Buddha taught about comfort and would recommend getting yourself into a comfortable posture, one that you can stay in for a while. But if you do get uncomfortable, get yourself back comfortable again. That's the whole point of it. That's why he said go to the forest or to a foot of a tree or to an empty hut and sit down. Now, in the Pali, it— the word, I forgot what the actual word is, which You can look this up if you like. The word is to sit on a sitting place like a couch or a chair, but it is translated into English as cross-legged. And there is no cross-legged— it's furniture. And yet it's translated into English that you're supposed to sit in a cross-legged posture, maybe even the, uh, the Anapanasati or the full karmesa or the lotus or or whatever you can get into, or you can do some Zen and sit on your heels. Or if you can't do that, sit on a bench and pretend like you're sitting on your heels. There's just all kinds of stuff. In fact, the Thai people can even sit on the floor in a way that I've never been able to sit. With all of those years of sitting on the floor, could not get it so that I could put my right leg out to the side, fold my left leg under, and sit down on my butt and on my right thigh, on my left ankle. Can't do it. But they can. You know why? Because they've been doing it their whole lives. And so sitting postures is not what the Buddha teaches. He teaches to be comfortable, because only when you're comfortable as well as feeling safe and secure Can you then begin to feel satisfied? But you can only feel satisfied when you get the Samsara out of the mind, which means all of the bread or all the stuff that you want, and any of that kind of stuff, and actually enjoy the moment. Become in the present moment, right here, right now. The body is comfortable, we're safe, we're secure, there's no place to go and nothing to think about. Isn't that great? Wow, I could finally take a rest, as if whatever job that needed to be done has already been done now. And what job was it that needed to be done? Relaxing. And so this is the teaching of the Buddha, this state of getting yourself completely relaxed and satisfied in the Pali word Sukkha, which is exactly opposite in the Pali language as Dukkha. But in fact, in the Thai language, dukkha and sukka are opposites. And I've been informed by a student that even in the Gujarati language, dukkha and sukha are opposites. So take my word for it, guys. If you want to come out of dukkha, which is the whole teaching of the Buddha, dukkha, dukkha, Nirodha, get yourself into state of Sukkha, there you are right then and there. How long does that last? As long as you can sustain it, which is also part of that practice, is apply the mind to the wholesome, get yourself into really wholesome state, and then see how long you can stay there before those reds start coming back in. And when you catch them, you can chase them right back out again and keep that green. And the little red comes in, out you go. Aha, I see you, Mara, I see you. Get out, out you go. Now notice that one of the things that many students will do is when the red comes back in, they get all frustrated, they get red, they see red, they get red. I don't know, I want to have some wholesome thoughts here, guys, and I can't do it, you know. Well, that's just being a loser again. Never mind, throw those red thoughts out and say, oh yeah, well, I can do it now. You keep practicing over and over and over again, exchanging those unwholesome thoughts in. But you've already practiced. You guys know how to do this already, probably doing it many, many times. But now we're going to make a habit of Remembering to practice and to keep doing it.

**Speaker E:** Needs some time and practice. Right effort.

**Speaker A:** Right, over and over and over again. But the point is, is that every time that you do this, you get the reward right then and there.

**Speaker E:** That's the difference, huh?

**Speaker A:** That the reward is not all in the future, that this is not a buy now, pay later, or backwards kind of thing. This is, you get what you pay for, right then and there. What do we pay? Right effort. We pay attention. And what do we get out of it? This present moment. Wow, you're still alive, isn't that great? So we begin to pay attention to this present moment and how marvelous it is. As opposed to the past, which is all dead. And yet that's where we stay, in the past, trying to fix it. It's broken, you know. Every time you start thinking about the past, you'll start recognizing what's broken about it that needs to be fixed. So now we're making a plan, huh? We're going to try to repair the past. And when we catch ourselves doing that, we can say, hey man, that's red, let's drop that and let's just think about what's happening right now and stop thinking about trying to fix the past. As Jesus would say, let the dead bury the dead. We're just going to boogie on down the trail.

**Speaker D:** Should you, uh, should you ever use memories to generate Sukkha, like old childhood memories, or just good memories to create?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you just heard me do that with Yasin. I just did that. I also noticed a smile on his face, and then he says conceptually.

**Speaker G:** I can also mention Dhammarato's Mantra of Coca-Cola.

**Speaker A:** Look at that, it works! Isn't that amazing? That mantra actually works. It's one of the best mantras that I know of. Everybody gets a kick out of Coca-Cola when it's a mantra. Notice how many of you, in fact, saliva is beginning to flow.

**Speaker E:** I didn't get it. I mean, I remember you said something about Coca-Cola, but what was the the— what was the key point of this?

**Speaker A:** The point is, is that in Asia, especially in Indian Hinduism, they will pick a mantra that is often something that really means something to one of the people. But when we give a Westerner that mantra, it won't mean much of anything. So you can sit and say Om Namah Shivaya until kingdom comes, and it doesn't even thing to you. But if you can find a mantra that's actually valuable, wholesome, and useful— one they practice in Thailand is Budo, but they've been practicing their— I mean, this is a Buddhist culture. They understand what it means to talk yourself into bliss if you're up to it, is Jesus. Let's go, boy! Okay, so this is how people work themselves up. This is what mobs do, they chant, right? So get something and chant. This is a mantra. Coca-Cola will do. Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola. All right, all right.

**Speaker E:** Coca-Cola wasn't so big here. I mean, the big time of Coca-Cola in East Germany was the '90s.

**Speaker A:** I didn't really— that's okay, wrong generation for you. The word Coca-Cola means something else. When I was 3 years old, I had a stomachache and my mom took me to the doctor.

**Speaker E:** This I remember now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Coca-Cola. And so every time I think of the word Coca-Cola, I start to salivate. And so that's why I use that as an example, but it Works for a lot of people. They recognize, yeah, yeah, we are Pavlovian dogs. We are all a Pavlovian dog. Get over it. Enjoy it. Yeah, it's pretty— we just remember the wrong things. The dogs are smart enough to forget all of the bad stuff. If I beat you in the morning, you'll hate me all afternoon. If I beat the a dog in the morning, he'll be all over me with love and affection and licking my face. In the afternoon, he forgets all about it. I intend for you guys to understand about your own past. Forget about it. That's what Gawanka calls the Samskara. It's just the past. It's just the old garbage. Don't dwell in the past. Dwell in the present moment. Marvellous. Now, I actually had— sorry, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Oh, just any tips for waking up, paying attention? How do we— any hacks for— yes.

**Speaker A:** The hack is repetitive practice. Repetitive practice. Just like any child that's going to learn to play the piano has to sit down and practice that thing over and over and over again. In fact, this is part of the reason why the Anapanasati Sutta is worded the way that it is. Mindfully, we take a deep in-breath. Mindfully, we take a long out-breath. Then mindfully, we take another in-breath. What's this mindfulness stuff with this Sati? It's that when we are remembering to make this a long breath, this breath, then that's actually practicing Sati. So every breath that you do recognize as a long breath or as a short breath, that's Sati. It's to wake up and look at how you're breathing. Okay, then we begin to wake up and what are we thinking? Then we begin to wake up, how am I feeling? Then we begin to wake up, what a bunch of garbage that is. And there you have the Satipatthana.

**Speaker B:** Is there a certain amount of force or conscious intention we should use?

**Speaker A:** Yes. It's called right effort. Thank you for bringing it up. Right effort is actually part of the Eightfold Noble Path, right noble effort that is required in order to bring on the right noble Samma Sanghappa of getting your act together. In other words, in order to get your act together, you're going to have to do a whole lot of gathering around after you see how much pile of shit you've got that's all over the place. One item at a time, you see, you pick it up, you put it in the pile, and pretty soon you got your bag of shit together. That's what this is all about. If I can say it in a colorful way.

**Speaker B:** Sometimes those turds get very old, very stuck, can't get them out.

**Speaker A:** Never mind, start again. Oh, I hear you. Oh, poor him. Sometimes it gets old and stuck. Can you hear that? Let's all have a pity party and recognize that that too is just a red thought. We can change it to green. And we can say, yes, I can do that. Yeah, it's old and it's stuck. You got a chisel? It's so counterintuitive because— I've got one that's old and stuck. Oh my dear, I want to go get it.

**Speaker E:** It is so counterintuitive because we are told our whole lives things are completely different, almost the opposite in Western—.

**Speaker A:** Congratulations, congratulations. Wake up! You have been lied to your whole life. That's why you are a victim, is because you have been victimized. Wake up and live the life of the winner that you could have been a child if they hadn't beat you into being whatever they beat you into being. This is why we call it freedom. This is what Moksha is all about, is to release that Samskara, to release all of that old stuff from the past. Get over it, let it go, drop it, be here now. This is a really great place to be, and you're still alive. No matter how much Samskara you had, you're free from it right now if you let yourself be. Any comments? This is so much fun, guys. Thank you.

**Speaker E:** I'm really— in the beginning, it's especially for me, what was a key element is this, this tendency to drift off into delusion. Replacing being at fasa, being at contact in the sense doors, with an internal delusion of being in the sense doors. This wasn't really— I couldn't really see this. But with practice over and over and over again, eventually there were some glimpses and then bigger glimpses and then bigger, bigger, bigger. And then I could see, oh my, I'm in, I'm constantly in this, in this fog of self-generated bullshit. And it's, it's quite.

**Speaker G:** Uh, it's quite.

**Speaker A:** Liberating to know that themselves, huh? Yeah, it's really liberating to figure out, oh, this is how, this is how I'm stuck. Oh, now I get it. I understand finally that I have been making my own prison.

**Speaker E:** This is really looking. This is really thinking. This is really hearing. This is— and not some, not some print of it.

**Speaker A:** Can't get it out of a book. This is the part of the Dharma that does not come bound.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, it's amazing.

**Speaker A:** Uh, actually, when we get above the maze, we can see the maze as a maze without finding the maze amazing. The reason the maze is amazing is because we're stuck in the maze. We're down too close to the ground. So imagine that I've seen two kinds of mazes. One is out of bushes that are so high that you can't see over it, and those mazes are really hard to get out of. But if you can see exactly that same maze that's cut into carpet on the floor where you can walk around, you can also, by just looking around, see the entire maze. Then you know exactly how to get out of it because you can see it from above. This is why I recommend that you do that for your own mind. Because it's not a basic teaching, it's what's going on.

**Speaker E:** This is why we go from Sila over Samadhi to Pañña, right?

**Speaker A:** Right, from action, all we need in the beginning is enough Sila. To get secluded is enough Sila, to get away from it all. To get away from, so that you can sit down and get some seclusion and get some quiet. And then the next thing we do is that we get the red out. That's the purification of the mind, which is normally called also Samadhi. And then the next one is the purification of the view, which is Anapanasati, and that is to see this cycle of red and green and red and green.

**Speaker E:** Don't we try to go from wisdom over Samadhi to Sila?

**Speaker A:** Well, actually, wisdom is the actual starting point, which is Right Noble View. There's actually two paths. There's the ordinary path, that is Sila, Samatha, Pañña, and then there is the noble path, is the Pañña, Samatha, with Sila winding up as the end result. And someplace along the way, every student has to move off of the ordinary path onto the noble path. That's why I keep my boots on, is because it's my job to cook them out, to kick them off of the ordinary path onto the noble path.

**Speaker E:** But not in the what.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker E:** Not in the what?

**Speaker A:** Not in the what? Oh, you better believe that the noble Arhats of all the Watts that I've been to, they know how to use boots.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, yeah, I'm trying to, trying to.

**Speaker A:** Basically, you are not allowed to talk here. Yeah, I know, I know.

**Speaker E:** I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

**Speaker A:** So anybody got anything else?

**Speaker C:** I've got one small thing. Okay, um, I was always looking for, at least in recent times, the Theravada equivalent of the clear light or the luminous mind, and I found something called, in Pali, uh, I believe it's pronounced Bhavana or Bhavana.

**Speaker A:** Okay, all right.

**Speaker C:** I was wondering how one, through something like Anapanasati, comes to realize that state or recognize its presence in our fundamental nature.

**Speaker A:** Actually, one of the local meditation centers were actually Arahat, which Ajahn Po has retired to, is named Adhipa Bhavana, which is that word that you're using. The word Bhavana also has a similar point to it called Bhagwan. Bhavana actually means itself development. So, 'Dhipa' is the word for light, and Bhavana means the development of light.

**Speaker C:** Well, there's the one that is Bhavana, but there's one that has a G in it, which is translated as the ground of becoming or condition for existence. Also Bhavana, Citta, I think it's pronounced.

**Speaker A:** I'm not sure about that one.

**Speaker C:** Okay, it's— it says it's in the Abhidhamma, but I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Oh, okay, right. I plead ignorance, Your Honor. Yes, uh, that my attitude about the Abhidhamma is very similar to the, um, the view that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa had about the Abhidhamma. He said if you get cold at night, you got some firewood there.

**Speaker C:** Oh wow. I'm very much appreciative of traditions that sort of cut away the excess fat and just leave the flesh and bones. So if it's something that you feel like is sort of that excess, then I wouldn't be too keen on looking into it too deeply. But I was curious to see what your understanding of the fundamental nature of mind was. And that was sort of the vocab that popped up for that.

**Speaker A:** Okay, the fundamental nature of the mind is that it is constantly changing, and if you are intending for it to, it will be under constant development. But it makes perfect sense to me. Control over it is going to be all over the place because it's going to change. Sometimes you feel like a nut, Sometimes you don't, but when you get control over that, then that means that your mind is in a state of development, which is Anagami. You can see what's going on. There's a lot of little analogies for this in the Pali, and this is one of them. To develop. It's actually part of Anapanasati that you see in the English language version that we have of "thus one trains oneself." That's the development. We train in Samadhi, which means we train in Sukkha. We train in Piti, in the sense of feeling the exhilaration of being a winner, that we could do this, we can handle this, that this is a piece of cake, this is easy peasy. And our whole life becomes easy peasy because of the attitude that we have, okay, the attitude of a winner. And this is to be developed, this is a skill to be developed. Very few people ever get this skill without it actually being developed. This is why it has to be practiced, is the practice is in fact another word for develop. It has to be practiced. And so when do we do this? When do we practice this? The answer to that is every time that we remember it, Sati. Well, when do we remember? Every time we remember to remember it. Let's get some memory going here, let's start watching what? A wakey wakey, folks. Wakey wakey, time to wake up and look at what's going on. And then do it again, and then do it again, then do it again. And pretty soon you get it on a roll and it feels really good. But so long as you keep coming back, oh, this is hard, or this is tired, or there it comes again, and this is too much, and all of that— those are those kind of red thoughts that have been interfering with you being successful right from the get-go. When you can do this correctly right from the very beginning, there's no reason to spend a lot of time on the ordinary Eightfold Noble Path. Let's get on the Noble Path immediately. Let's start practicing correctly. Let's change those red thoughts, those unwholesome thoughts, into wholesome thoughts. Which means that you're changing the thoughts from "I can't do it" into "I can do it.".

**Speaker C:** Something I always did before I engaged in Buddhism more directly was self-analysis of thoughts. Like, I would, if I had a negative thought that really bothered me, I would look directly at the desire, whether it be selfish or unselfish, that caused that thought and the solution that the thought implies. Right? Like if you have a thought that says, man, this hunger is terrible, to an extent the thought is actually just directly asking you to go eat food rather than just complaining on its own.

**Speaker A:** Right? Okay. And the wisdom to know the difference, right? That's actually an important part. Let's have, uh, not just the courage, but the enthusiasm to go change the things that we can change, and to accept the things that we can't change, like other people, or the society, or the rules that everybody keeps. Can't change any of that. And having the wisdom to know the difference between what we can change and what we can't change, that's a marvelous way of looking at it. Okay, let's figure out what we can change. And one of the things we can change is our own attitude. So we can either see the world as a terrible place, or we can see it as a marvelous place, or we can see it the way that it is, is a marvelous place with a whole lot of unhappy people in it. And why do they are so unhappy? Because they've got a wrong attitude, a bad attitude. Attitude about it. And so this is why we want to practice it, is because you have spent your whole life around other people who were teaching you how to feel bad, and you know very well how to feel bad. So now you need to learn how to feel really good so that you can see that you do have control in your own life already anyway, that you've always been in control, you just didn't know it. But once you begin to actually control it and take it in the direction you want to go in, then you recognize, hey, I've been in charge all along, and I thought I was the passenger.

**Speaker C:** In some states of meditation, when I got a little farther, quote unquote, what I would call a deeper state, I realized pretty quickly that in my own opinion I was sort of the pilot of the body rather than just the observer. Then I got a little farther than that, and then I thought to myself to an extent that all there was left was just observation. And then I really don't know where there— other than of course the enlightened state where in between, what that would look like.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's certainly going in the right direction. The first one at the bottom would be anxiety is there, and we're in anxiety saying, I feel anxious. Then we observe the anxiety and say, I am not the anxiety, I'm the one that observes the anxiety, right? And then we start looking at that and says, wait a minute, I'm not the observer, there's just observation and there is nothing but observation, including the observation of the observation, and there's no real self there. Where does Dukkha come from is when we then have the delusion that there is some self that needs protection, which comes instinctually from the self-preservation instinct. We grew up as human beings out of nature, out of evolution with the idea that if you did not wake up and check out what was going on and get some adrenaline going, you're going to get eaten 3 seconds from now. Guess what? That doesn't happen much in our society. It's not 3 seconds that it takes for us to get eaten. It takes 35 or 40 years for us to get nibbled away. But we still have that fear Often, the fear of, "There he goes again, another Neville is gone." And so, we actually have a lot of false positives of fear, that we have fear when we don't really need to be feared. If we can begin to recognize that much of the fear that we've had, it was actually kind of prevented, in the sense that any bad thing that you can ever think of what was going to happen, probably 99% of the time, never actually happened. You took care of it long before. Or it never happened anyway. Completely wrong. An example of that is, going home late from the school one time, I thought the girlfriend would be really angry at me, because I was chatting with students and having a ball. She expected me at 2:00 and I'm at 4:00, walking in the door expecting hell to pay. And she was so happy to see me, it completely confused me at the time. So, these are the kinds of things that we have expectations of something going to happen that never happens. So, it's better to begin to see that kind of stuff. Recognize, oh, that's just another unwholesome thought. I don't know what's going to happen. Let me wait and see what's happening, and I'll play it by ear. In other words, do you actually trust yourself enough to play by ear and live this present moment without planning for it in the past? Can you go out on stage and perform in front of 500 people without having a repertoire? Or will the old repertoire be good enough and you don't have to practice or perform or do anything, that you know this syllabus by heart, you've got it down, you've taught this course so many times that you don't have to review, you just walk out on stage, this moment's good enough? Okay, but how many of us spend all of our lives rehearsing for a stage play that we never get to perform?

**Speaker C:** Well, it's really funny because a lot of the time when we deliberate or practice or rehearse, we're actually just doing that to soothe our nerves. And when we actually engage in the actions that we were planning for, we do nothing similar to what we planned on doing. It's almost like we'll just sort of argue with ourselves about it and then make a snap decision automatically at the last second.

**Speaker A:** Right. And so look how much— look how hard we tried, look how much we've done, and it was all pointless when we could have just been sitting here and feeling good without having to come to a conclusion. That is in fact one of the important things about right noble view, is that ordinary wrong view and ordinary right view are both conclusions. They're both ways of looking at the world. They're worldviews. The wrong view can be stated in the sense of, "I can get away with it, I can do it." And the ordinary right view is, "Oh no, you can't. We're going to make sure you don't get away with it. We're going to hire some cops, or teachers, or lawyers, or If none of that— soldiers, whatever— and if none of that works, we'll get a priest. We'll get you someday, but you won't get away with it. The right noble view is not a viewpoint or a noun. It's more of a verb. It's like looking, investigating, and keep looking and keep investigating, but only come to the conclusion of what you're seeing right now. If you take this as the conclusion, and then go around not looking anymore, this conclusion and the reality is going to change. We have to keep looking. That's the right noble effort that we'll never stop doing. When you would say, "Well, does an Arahant ever get to the point that he never has anything?" The answer to that is only when he's dead, because if he stops watching and stops looking, something's going to clobber him. So you got to keep your mind and eye open. You got to stay open. So this is how we start to practice. We don't demand that we're open all the time or that we're alert and aware all the time, but remember every time that we can remember to wake up. Be here now. See how things are right now. Then we'll fall asleep again and back into thought process, and we say, wake up. And come back again, over and over and over again. To wake up, to see what's going on, to take right effort to change it, and then congratulate yourself for the change that you just made. This is the Eightfold Noble Path. And those four things bring the mind together into a unified state. Red thoughts will always get us into an argument. With ourselves. But these kind of thoughts, the unification thoughts, place us in a state of where we don't want anything. We're good, everything is fine, I'm satisfied, I'm okay, don't need a thing except this next breath. And it was a good one too. I invite you, take a— have a breath on me. The bar's open. Well, does anybody have anything to say?

**Speaker D:** Happy to be here.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, I was just gonna say, I have one more week until a deadline, and then I'll be able to start practicing Anapanasati without my laptop in front of me, and I'm looking forward to that.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, when you're looking forward, recognize that, oh, I'm looking forward right now when I could do it right now. Yeah, that's true.

**Speaker F:** It's not quite the same. I like sitting down and just shutting my eyes and be like, nothing to do, and then doing that for a lot longer than just 3 seconds and be like, keep typing.

**Speaker A:** Yes, if you can practice 3 seconds, then when you do have 5, then you'll be able to manage that whole 5 seconds. If you don't practice, this is very true.

**Speaker F:** This is the thing I'm trying to remind myself is that if I I still need to, like, I still can do it for the little bit of time I have. And that's not— and that is worth so much because when I sit down, it's a lot easier. I was speaking to a monk recently, and I think this is something that you've mentioned before. He used the analogy of if you're a painter and you're painting all day, at the end of the day, if you're not washing your hands regularly, you're going to have a thick layer of paint on your hands. And of course, it's going to be ages to wash off, whereas you talked about it, if you're running a restaurant, you got to keep clearing the counter little by little occasionally so that you don't have a big mess at the end of the day.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's a good paint analogy, right? If you paint all day and paint all day and you don't wash your hands, then you've got a whole bunch of paint built up. But if you occasionally go and wash your hands and get the paint off, then they're not so hard to wash. Yes, this is the whole point of Anapanasati. Let's do this often, to where within the Anicca method they have it, oh, you do it for a long, long time. So I would recommend in that regard for the students to say, okay, let's put an hour a day in, 10 minutes at a time, 6 times a day. Yes, because then we— if you have only 10 minutes to get your mind together, you'll actually do that. If you have an hour, you'll piss it away.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, yeah, 100%. And that's okay. Like, you know, sometimes circumstances mean that you only have 10 minutes, but sometimes circumstances mean you have 2 hours, and you got to make the best of what you have every single time. Because thinking this— because thinking, oh no, I didn't meditate today, and oh no, this, that, and the other— is just like, well, it's easy to do, and I do it 100%. But you know, I, I try and— I remember that like, hang on, no, I can just— if I have time to be upset about not meditating, I also have time to just take a deep breath.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. So, so when you— instead of having all of that fascination that you just had, you could cut right through it and says, I'm glad I don't have to think about meditation right now. Yeah, I don't have to think about all that stuff now. Schedules I'm on or anything. I can just remember to relax and have joy right now. Isn't that great?

**Speaker F:** Indeed.

**Speaker A:** That's the way to practice, is remember to practice right now rather than remembering to set a schedule to practice later.

**Speaker C:** Got you, Jerry, got you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so it happens.

**Speaker F:** I've had a regular practice, you know, pretty intense for the last year, and then in the last few weeks things happened and I was like, okay, well, I guess this is how it is right now, and once it will be over, it'll be back to the things of the way we were, and that's how it goes.

**Speaker A:** Even monks get busy. Things never were the same. Yes, exactly. That's one thing about evolution, is it's always heading— the time is always going in one direction. It doesn't go back. Humans can put the connections together because there are some kinds of cycles. They say that it doesn't repeat, but it rhymes. And so It's not ever going to be. Here's a really good idea, uh, example of that. And how many people thought that when COVID is over, things are going to get back to normal? Guess what? There is a new normal, but it's a new normal. It's not the normal before COVID This is the new normal. It's not the same thing. Nothing ever is. The only thing that matters though is, is that are you okay with it right now? Because if you're not, you're in Dukkha. And so getting right with whatever is going on is the way of feeling good. Is it not my problem? Not my worry? Let me get my mind straightened out. When I get my mind straightened out, then I really won't worry about it. So has anybody got any thing to say. Let's go ahead and finish this off. This has been a really great talk. I've really had a ball today. How many people have had a ball? Yeah, excellent. Well, does anybody have any parting words? Anything to say? Go ahead, Carl. I just want to say, don't worry, be happy. That's it. That's all there is. With Metta, I'll say peace and love. You guys have some fun together. Call each other. You guys are on the, uh, the call together. Let's get some Sangha going here. You don't need me. You guys You've got all the Sangha that you need. Go, go pester each other with joy. A quick question. Yes, go ahead.

**Speaker C:** Um, are you uploading this to YouTube?

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Uh, I think, I think we got.

**Speaker C:** Flashed today a little bit because someone walked by and they were like taking a shower or something. I think there was some nudity in the video. So you might want to check for that.

**Speaker E:** I think you're— I think one of your visitors or relatives.

**Speaker A:** One of my relatives?

**Speaker E:** I don't know.

**Speaker C:** I believe it was a woman or someone walked past. They were in the hammock or something like that before, then they took a bath and then they weren't wearing clothes.

**Speaker E:** So with a towel or something like this?

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So it wasn't nudity, it was just a towel.

**Speaker C:** Oh no, it was the full, full back and buttocks.

**Speaker D:** It was a bit flash, wasn't it? Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it was. So it would, it would get removed from YouTube is all I'm saying. You might want to add like a black box or something in that area on the right or left side of your screen.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Do you know what moment it was in?

**Speaker C:** I believe it was about 40 minutes ago, if I had to guess.

**Speaker A:** All right, okay, well, I'll ask Parker to take a look. If anybody can identify what actual moment it was, that's a go for a Dukkha to search, and so will I. We'll see if we can identify them, the moment in time. Did anybody else see it?

**Speaker D:** Yes.

**Speaker F:** Clearly not paying enough attention here.

**Speaker A:** Okay guys, well we'll finish now, we'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** Bye, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Thank you, thanks so much.

**Speaker D:** Thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Okay, bye-bye. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A), is a lively and practical discussion centered on **Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing)** and its role in the **Eightfold Noble Path**. The core teaching is about actively purifying the mind by replacing unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones, leading to joy and freedom in the present moment.

Here is a structured summary of the key points:

### **Core Teaching: Changing the Mind from "Red" to "Green"**
*   **The Central Metaphor:** Dhammarato uses the simple exercise of switching mental focus from the color "red" to "green" to demonstrate that we can intentionally change the content of our mind. "Red" represents unwholesome, burdensome thoughts (Sankhara/Samskara), while "Green" represents wholesome, pleasant, and skillful thoughts.
*   **The Method:** The practice is not passive observation, but **active replacement**. When you notice an unwholesome "red" thought (worry, anger, anxiety), you consciously "set it down" and replace it with a wholesome "green" thought (joy, satisfaction, a good memory, a joke).
*   **The Goal:** This repeated, successful act of changing your mind builds confidence (Saddha), leads to a feeling of satisfaction (Sukkha), and purifies the mind. It's about becoming a "winner" in your own mind, not a victim of your thoughts.

### **Critique of Other Methods (Goenka)**
*   The talk begins by contrasting Dhammarato's approach with the Goenka Vipassana method:
    *   **No Nose Tip:** He emphasizes that the Anapanasati Sutta does not mention focusing on the nose tip or nostrils; the focus is on the breath and the entire body.
    *   **Beyond Body Scanning:** While body scanning (a formalized part of Goenka's practice) relates to experiencing the body, Dhammarato argues it's more crucial to first "put out the fire in your mind" by changing unwholesome thoughts. If a negative thought arises during scanning, address that first.
    *   **Active vs. Passive:** The method taught here is presented as more actively engaged in thought management rather than solely observing sensations with equanimity.

### **Integration with the Buddha's Path**
*   **One Meditation:** Dhammarato asserts, following Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, that the Buddha essentially taught one meditation: **Anapanasati practiced as the Eightfold Noble Path.**
*   **Path to Enlightenment:** The sequence is: Anapanasati fulfills the Four Foundations of Mindfulness (Satipatthana), which fulfills the Seven Factors of Enlightenment (Sambhojjhanga), leading to knowledge and deliverance.
*   **The "Key" to Samsara:** The moment of recognition—"Aha, I see you, Mara!"—is the key. Seeing the unwholesome thought ("red") is the first step to disengaging from the cycle of suffering (Dependent Origination).

### **Practical Instructions & Attitude**
*   **Start with Safety & Comfort:** Before deep practice, ensure you feel physically safe and comfortable. The Buddha's instruction is to find a comfortable seat, not necessarily a cross-legged one.
*   **Generate Sukkha (Happiness/Relief):** Actively create a sense of well-being. Use memories, jokes, mantras (he humorously suggests "Coca-Cola"), or simply the relief of being alive and safe. This is a skill to be developed.
*   **Right Effort is Repetitive Practice:** The "hack" for waking up is constant, repetitive practice. Every mindful breath is an act of mindfulness (Sati). Remember to practice in small moments throughout the day (e.g., 10 minutes, 6 times a day) rather than waiting for perfect, long sessions.
*   **Winner's Attitude:** Cultivate the attitude of a champion, not a loser. Congratulate yourself for every successful moment of changing your mind. This confidence and joy are the foundations for deeper states of concentration (Jhana).

### **Answering Listener Questions**
The talk is interactive, with Dhammarato addressing several questions:
*   **On Aphantasia (inability to visualize):** He advises not to cling to a skill you lack. Capitalize on other strengths (e.g., conceptual thinking, humor, memory of joyful feelings) to generate wholesome mental states.
*   **On Using Memories:** Yes, using positive memories to generate Sukkha is encouraged and effective.
*   **On the Nature of Mind:** The fundamental nature of the mind is that it changes and can be developed. The goal is to gain control over its direction through continuous development (Bhavana).
*   **On Observation vs. Control:** The path moves from being identified with anxiety, to observing it, to realizing there is just observation without a solid self. Suffering arises from the delusion of a self that needs protection.

### **Conclusion & Encouragement**
*   **Practice Now:** Don't wait for ideal conditions. Practice remembering to be present and joyful in the very moment you think about meditating.
*   **Sangha Support:** Encourages the group to support each other and build community.
*   **Final Message:** The essence of the practice is encapsulated in the phrase: **"Don't worry, be happy."** By actively changing your mind and attitude, you can find peace and freedom right now.

**Overall Tone:** The talk is direct, humorous, and demystifying. Dhammarato presents the Dhamma as an accessible, practical toolkit for taking charge of one's mental well-being and finding immediate relief from suffering through intentional, joyful practice.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this lively and informal talk, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain Buddhist meditation concepts and correct perceived misunderstandings in popular methods like Goenka's. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **Red Thoughts / Green Thoughts:** The core metaphor. "Red" represents unwholesome, burdensome thoughts (Sankharas). "Green" represents wholesome, pleasant, present-moment thoughts. The practice is to consciously notice the "red" and change your mind to "green," just as one can switch mental focus from imagining the color red to imagining green.
2.  **Carrying a Burden / Setting it Down:** Enlightenment is described as 1) waking up to see the burden you're carrying (crappy thoughts, past conditioning), and 2) setting it down immediately. Samskaras are the "crap" or "baggage" we carry.
3.  **The Athlete's Victory Pose:** Generating wholesome joy (Sukkha) is likened to the feeling and physical expression of an athlete who just scored a spectacular goal—arms in the air, cheering "I can do it!" This is the attitude to cultivate.
4.  **The Maze:** Being lost in unwholesome thinking is like being stuck in a tall hedge maze. Gaining wisdom (pañña) is like rising above to see the entire maze layout from above, instantly knowing how to get out.
5.  **Pavlovian Dog:** We are conditioned like Pavlov's dogs, but we often remember and salivate over the wrong things (stress, past trauma). We should re-condition ourselves toward joy.
6.  **Pile of Dirt / Emperor:** Everyone is the "emperor of their own pile of dirt" (their life and mind). The key question is whether you are buried under it, clawing to the top, or sitting happily on top of it. It's a choice of mental attitude.
7.  **Washing Paint Off Hands:** If you paint all day (accumulate mental stress), you must wash your hands regularly (practice mindfulness often) or you'll end up with a thick, hard-to-remove layer (a big mess of stress). Similarly, a restaurant worker must clear the counter little by little to avoid a big mess.
8.  **Pilot vs. Observer:** Describes stages of insight: first, feeling like the anxious passenger ("I feel anxious"), then the observer of the anxiety ("I see the anxiety"), then just pure observation with no separate "self" doing the observing.
9.  **Rehearsing for a Play Never Performed:** Many people spend their lives rehearsing and worrying about future events that never happen, instead of being present and "performing" in the current moment.

### **Stories & Analogies**
1.  **The Buddha Under the Bodhi Tree:** The moment of enlightenment is referenced with the phrase, *"Aha, I got you, Mara! Aha, I see you!"* This is equated to spotting a "red" thought (Mara) and recognizing it.
2.  **Mara's Three Daughters:** The story of Mara (the personification of temptation and death) having three daughters named **Lobha (Greed), Dosa (Ill-will), and Moha (Delusion)** is used to categorize unwholesome mental states.
3.  **The Coca-Cola Mantra:** A personal story where the speaker, as a child, was given Coca-Cola for a stomachache. Now, the word "Coca-Cola" triggers salivation and a pleasant association. This is used as an example of a effective, personal "mantra" to trigger a wholesome feeling, contrasting with traditional mantras that may hold no meaning for Westerners.
4.  **The Late Homecoming:** A personal anecdote where the speaker came home late, expecting his girlfriend to be angry ("red" thought/expectation), but she was actually happy to see him. This illustrates how our fearful expectations are often wrong and create unnecessary dukkha.
5.  **The Dog's Forgiveness:** If you beat a dog in the morning, it will love you by the afternoon because it forgets. Humans, however, hold onto past grievances. The lesson is to be more like the dog and "forget about" the past garbage (Samskaras).

### **Overall Rhetorical Purpose**
The speaker uses these metaphors and stories to:
*   **Demystify meditation:** Make it seem accessible, immediate, and about changing thoughts *right now*.
*   **Critique "over-complicated" methods:** Contrast his simple "red to green" method with techniques like body scanning or focusing on the nose tip, which he argues are not found in the core suttas.
*   **Emphasize attitude and joy:** Shift the focus from passive observation and purification to active cultivation of a "winner's" attitude, joy (Sukkha), and self-congratulation.
*   **Anchor teachings in experience:** Use relatable, modern, and sometimes humorous analogies to explain traditional Pali terms (Sankhara, Sukkha, Sati, Mara).
