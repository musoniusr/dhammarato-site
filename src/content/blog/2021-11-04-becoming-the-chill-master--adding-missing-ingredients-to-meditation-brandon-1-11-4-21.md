### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, this is your first call, Brandon. I welcome you. I'm glad that you're here.

**Speaker B:** I appreciate you giving me the time.

**Speaker A:** A lot of— in fact, not just a lot, but all of what the Buddhist teaching is is the teaching of friendship. The whole show is nothing but friendship. But we don't know how to be friends with other people, not very well, because we don't know how to be friends with ourselves very well. So the first thing that we need to do is learn to be friends with the inside, and then we can learn to be friends with the whole world. But in a way, we have to get away from the world. In order to do that. And when we come back, we don't come back into the world, we come back above the world, in the sense that Jesus even said it, and, uh, being in the world but not of the world. Well, here we're going to practice not even being in the world, we just want to float above it.

**Speaker B:** I, I heard a very similar thing in a book I was reading about Anicca, Anapanasati, Bhikkhuni, Bhikkhu, Bhikkhuni, Anicca, actually in the world, but above the world, essentially.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. To come out of it, to let go. But in order to do that, we have to see the way that we're clinging. But there's more to it than that. Not only do we see the way that we are clinging, we have to let go of that particular clinging that's happening in that particular moment or mind moment. Let it go right now, to practice letting go. This is what the whole teaching really is all about, is to see something and drop it. Just like if you put your hand on this, uh, you leaned against, um, the counter in your house and it happened not to be the counter, it was the hot stove turned on, and you put your elbow on it, you're going to take your elbow off of that hot stove immediately. Leave, right? In fact, you don't even have to think about it. The elbow itself will come off that stove. The feeling of pain is quite remarkable like that, that even a tender infant, if you put a hot coal on the foot or the hand of a tender infant, that tender infant will draw that hand back. And then ball up in tears.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So this is the way that we have to begin to operate, is that there is instincts in there. Those natural tendencies are very fast, and yet the way that we're taught to think is kind of slow. And so one of the things that we need to do is to pay attention well enough to see things that happen very, very fast in the mind. And this is why we're practicing the way that we do, is to begin to watch what's going on. But that watching what's going on is not enough. It's really not. That in fact, there's a missing ingredient in there, this part of the Buddhist path, of the Eightfold Noble Path. But somehow or another, over time, Some of the pieces of that puzzle, that giant jigsaw puzzle— you think of the Buddhist teaching as a jigsaw puzzle, but Western Buddhism is that same jigsaw puzzle with a few pieces gone. Okay. Now there's another way of thinking about it, and thinking about it in this sense is that the teachings of the Buddha is like a precious gem, or let us say it's in fact three gems. The Trilokana, or the three gems, are the three refuges. And that these very, very valuable gems are kept in a very, very ornate, beautiful box. But the box itself is a puzzle box. And the name of that box— and by the way, the box is extraordinarily beautiful, it's extraordinarily ornate, it's very, very finely detailed. And the name of that box is Buddhism. And what is in the West is that box, and within that box is a puzzle, and within that puzzle is the prize. But the box itself is very ornate and satisfying for many people. So the ordinary teachings that you have are actually the same teachings that are in the the gems inside, except that the gems inside have to do with the quality of having those gems rather than hunting for them. Okay. All right. Because we're out there all looking. And in fact, there's an old song that's very funny that way. The name of the song is Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places.

**Speaker B:** Now, I think I've heard at least the name of the song, but I've probably heard it too.

**Speaker A:** Well, I won't sing it to you right now. We'll just move on.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** But that's what we're doing. We're looking for love in all the wrong places, and that the entire society is based on the premise that the love that we're looking for is in the society, which is the wrong place to look. The real issue is that it's inside, but we have been using the inside as a garbage pit, and we have just taken all kinds of garbage out of society thinking that that was the gem. And that what we need to do is to do a major dump, a major getting rid of, a major unloading. This is what the real teaching is about, that Buddhism is not going to add anything to your life. Nothing. You're not going to get anything out of it. Sunyata. Zip. Zilch. Nothing. You're not going to get anything out of it. But maybe if you're lucky, you're going to start losing a whole bunch of crap.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I see. I see the difference there.

**Speaker A:** And so, uh, then that's, that's the issue, is, is that Western people, and therefore Western Buddhism, is going out looking for the goal, looking for the prize, looking for a reason or rationale or a prize. Right, we're looking for something that we think is someplace else. But a better way of looking at it is, no, it's right here. All you have to do is just uncover it. And uncovering it means you've got to take a lot of the crap that we've been piling on.

**Speaker B:** I've heard a lot of similar things said, or in the whole non-dual sphere, kind of related to that.

**Speaker A:** All right, so we can think of all of this crap that's piled on in two regards. One is, is that we can see that, uh, that because we're human, we came out of the past Whether you believe in evolution or not is not the point. The point is, is that we have things coming out of the past and that humans would have never survived if they did not know what danger was. Yeah. And so we have instincts, and those instincts have been keeping us alive as a civilization for many centuries. But that, that self-preservation preservation instinct of staying alive, and its language is the language of fear. Yeah, and that goes right back to whatever we were way back when, back to dinosaur times. It was the same issue as survival. And so that winds up then being a major issue even when we have a life that is completely safe. We still see things that are safe as a survival issue. Because we're living our lives instinctively. So these instincts then greatly interfere. But we can think of that, and we'll talk in detail about the instincts at a later time. But right now we can think of the instincts as like a box that we have been carrying or actually using to put the garbage in. In other words, we have been operating instinctively and listening to the parents and other things around us when we were children and picking up what they've now acknowledged that they've got in their instinct box. And then we're putting it into our instinct box and doing things instinctively. So an example of that would be the self-preservation instinct. Leads then to the nesting instinct. And the nesting instinct means that we want to herd together. And in fact, society's glue is the human's nesting instinct. And the issue of the nest is that if you're going to be in this nest, you have to follow the rules of this nest. So our little individual child, when he is born and being raised in Western society, has this instinct. And then by the time of 6 or 7, he's told that he's got to go to school and learn to read. And the kid doesn't want to stop playing with his toys. He's having a lot of fun. But we're told, no, you have to go do what you're told to do. And we're threatened with punishment. We're threatened with obliteration. We're threatened with being kicked out, ostracized, not wanted. And so we go along to get along. We go do what we're told to do, but we resent it. Okay. And so resentment for authority is then something that we put into our little box of nesting instinct. See how that works?

**Speaker B:** Okay. Yeah, that makes sense.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And we learn to resist authority because the authorities that are over me now resisted their authorities also. And so when we resist authorities, that means that We either go along to get along and have underlying resentment, or we're afraid to buck the rules because of the fear of punishment, or we're defiant and rebellious. But we make these various choices very early in life, and then we continue down the line of how are we going to deal with authority figures for the rest of our lives. Yeah, including am I going to be one of these authority figures?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, so that's that whole status symbol comes from the nesting instinct of, um, this is my house, if you're going to live in my house you have to follow my rules. And so this is what the alpha male in a wolf pack will be. He's guy that sets the rules, which means he's going to growl at pups at night when they're in his nest. So that's, uh, and but the danger is, is that to get either, uh, rebelling against the nest, or worse still, by that rebellion, getting kicked out of the nest, and now you're out in danger. The stragglers in a herd are the ones who get eaten. And so the natural mentality of humans is the safest place is in the middle of the nest, in the middle of the herd. And if you're in the dead center of it, then you're the authority, and that's the safest place to be, except for all the other people who want to be authority figures. And now you're their target, and so it maybe is not the safest place, but the idea is, is that it's the safest place when in fact it's not. So what we need to do instead is practice feeling safe rather than having to operate on instincts. In other words, we're going to choose wisdom and seeing over the old programming of instincts. And when we live instinctively, that means we're living selfishly and we're trying to preserve the self rather than when we're living openly, then we can be altruistic and happy and easygoing because we're not in danger. Now, in the Pali, the Pali word for this is what we call— the word is abhaya. Abhaya is actually the word for fear, and abhaya means not fear. Yeah, but, uh, the translators then made that mistake and then called it fearlessness. But fearlessness in English language has a different connotation than what we're looking for. One who is fearless means here's the fearless warrior, he's ready to walk right into danger and, and have at it, right? But he's doing it from battle. He's doing it from danger. Yeah, we're not talking about being fearless in the face of danger in the sense of courage. We're talking about it in the sense of feeling safe. But in fact, that warrior doesn't feel safe. That's why he's built up that courage so he can walk right into battle and do that battle, because deep down inside he's afraid. That's why there's a battle already anyway. If you completely there's no battle going on. So we have to get into the mind state that there's no battle going on, because really you're not. You're not at battle. Why do we go around feeling afraid, feeling fear, when there's nothing to be afraid of? Be afraid of?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's— there's definitely a lot of neuroticism. In the world today. And, you know, the West is definitely no exception to that.

**Speaker A:** Today, yesterday, last year, 1,000 years ago, 2,000 years ago, and maybe in 2022. Who knows what the future is?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** But the trend is—

**Speaker B:** so yeah, I see, you see people make a lot of potentially bad decisions when they're in those really hard survival situations because it's just really pressing and, you know, it's taxing on you. So if you can get to a place where, you know, mentally, spiritually, you feel safe, I can definitely see the value in that. So how do we go about getting closer to that then?

**Speaker A:** Well, the answer is several things, but they all have to do with a package deal that is the entire teaching of the Buddha. That this ornate box that we were talking about, that is Buddhism, has a whole lot of fancy doodads on it to make it beautiful and enticing and lovely and desirable. That are not part of the teachings of the Buddha at all, that the Buddhist teaching is very simple. It's so simple it can come down to just a few words like Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. That's 3 words, and that means suffering, or Dukkha actually is better translated as dissatisfaction.

**Speaker B:** I had heard you say that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay. That suffering is a very heavy-duty word. Sounds to me, when you hear real suffering, that sounds like nails and crosses and that kind of stuff.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly. And then it makes people get the impression that, oh, if they do get somewhere here, then you should be able to deal with suffering. They have the idea of, you know, no suffering, or you you're free from suffering. And I don't know, that, that's not— it just doesn't seem like— when they—

**Speaker A:** but that's part of the grandiosity. You see, Western Buddhism is a very, very ornate, very grandiose box. It's a puzzle box that they don't know how to open, and so they add all of this grandiosity to it. That's just one example of it, uh, by using the word suffering, because suffering is the grandiose word, and we're just talking about simple dissatisfaction as opposed to simple satisfaction. That's the real essence of it, is can you come to a point of being satisfied that you've got enough? But everything is okay, everything is fine. No place to go, nothing to do, no worries, no flurries, no fear, no sorrow. Just everything's okay. Well, look at all of that stuff we've talked about just removing. All you have to do is remove the sorrow, remove the sadness, remove fear, remove this, that, the other thing, and what we're left with is a nice easygoing place. But we also have to remove the greed for getting something special out of it. But the Buddha does not teach heavens and hells, rebirth, spiritual powers, or any of that kind of stuff that's been added as doodads Anagami onto the box.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I've heard a lot of things like that in association with Buddhism, so, um, they really made me kind of question, you know, the, the whole system itself. You know, if they're claiming such things, it just makes it it seemed, well, yes, overly religious and kind of archaic, probably not.

**Speaker A:** You could go so far as not call that box Buddhism. You could call it Buddhist religion. That's the Buddhist religion in the West. The Buddhism in Thailand, that in the Thai language they use the word Buddhist teaching, and Bhikkhu Buddhadasa is quite fond of that word. And so I use that word differently without translating the word Satsang into the word religion. Religion, because he does not know what a religion is. Not what's in the West, because he's never been to the West. About as far away from Chaya that he's ever been is Bangkok. I think he's been in— he's been actually to Burma, but that was in the 1950s. And he's been to India, but that was in the 1930s. Okay, so, so that was a long time ago. And so, uh, the books, the stuff that he knows— and he's quite a fan of Christianity and, uh, the Bible and stuff like that, finds a lot of wisdom in there. But he also understands that Christianity, like Buddhism, is the original deal with a couple of pieces gone.

**Speaker B:** With a couple pieces are gone and a whole lot of exaggerations and a whole lot of exaggerations and translations mistakes probably, and a whole lot of stuff going on. But, um, yeah, that's what I find too. I find a lot of value in Christianity, um, have had a lot of positive experiences with it and Christians,

**Speaker A:** um,

**Speaker B:** so it's always good to see when

**Speaker A:** the Christians remember to be like Jesus then Christianity works. When they remember what Paul said about Jesus and then take Jesus and put him up on the high shelf and do Anicca, Anagami, Arahant, Bhikkhuni, Bhikkhu, Bhikkhu, Bhikkhuni, Bhikkhu, Bhikkhuni, Bhikkhu, Bhikkhuni, Bhikkhu, Bhikkhuni,

**Speaker B:** Bhikkhuni, Bhikkhuni, Bhikkhuni, Bhikkhuni, Then Christianity works.

**Speaker A:** When they remember what Paul said about Jesus and then take Jesus and put him up on the high shelf and do umidumigabigabi, rah rah sis boom bah, kiriye ileston, in excelsis Deo— when they do that, that means that they've lost it. That's one of the missing pieces, that Jesus and the teachings of Jesus is real in the sense of the The Beatitudes or the Sermon on the Mount, and also things like why the lily of the fields don't aggrandize themselves. Why do the Jews of that time dress up in all their finery to go to the temple? And other things like the birds of the— foxes of the field and the birds have their nest, but the Son of Man has no place to rest his head. You also know that in many places, especially Matthew, he referred to himself as Son of Man in the reference of trying to take them out of the mentality of we're the chosen children of God and I'm a son of God, you know. But Christians really just hung on to that whole concept that Jesus was trying to disrupt. Yeah, they stopped trying to make everything so damn special. And yet we're looking for special. We're looking for special cars, Lamborghinis, Teslas, all kinds of special cars, right? Why have to have a special car? Because if I have a special car, then I'm special. And we are taught in the West to be special. We tell our little kids to be special. Oh, you're so special. All right, and so we grow up with the expectations, oh, I've got to be special and prove myself special. Yeah, you don't have to do that. You're already okay. But we're— what we are piling on with this nesting instinct of all of these expectations of society, and when we come out of those expectations from society and recognize the second noble truth is, is that I myself am responsible for all the problems, all the dissatisfactions, and all the sufferings. And I do that by wanting things that I don't have and trying to get rid of things that I can't control, and the stupidity to think that I'm powerful enough to do all of that.

**Speaker B:** And so that's like a— that's the reverse Serenity Prayer. I think you just Uh, you saw me, are you aware? It sounded like basically— yes, no, it

**Speaker A:** is the Serenity Prayer, except that, uh, the, uh, the God to grant me the wisdom to figure out which is which. But I just— but I just did the Serenity Prayer recognizing that you're— that that's the cause of suffering, is the fact that we can't figure it out. Yeah, we don't know the difference between what we can do and what we can't do, or even what needs to be done. We think that I'll be okay if I get what I want, and then we go around being disappointed because I don't have what I want. But if I don't want anything, if I'm wise enough to not want anything, then I'm good to go. I'm fine. I'm good to stay, in fact, because I don't even have to go anywhere.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So this is the actual teachings of the Buddha that we cause our own problems, and that we do it moment by moment by moment. It's not a great big thing. It's not a big disaster. It's the fact that It's not the car crash, it's the fact that we didn't see things coming. I had a student one time who says that, wow, really glad that I woke up because I could see that I had to swerve out of the way of that car to prevent from hitting it and piling on the brakes. And I said, so you waited that long to wake up? You could have seen that car in front of you long before. Yeah, you wouldn't have had to have had an emergency stop. You'd have been paying attention to the road. So if we were paying attention to our life all along, we won't have any crashes.

**Speaker B:** So it's very much about a moment-to-moment—

**Speaker A:** it is very much awareness and shift moment to moment of what's going on. Okay. And then in fact, that is so important. That the Buddha actually gave himself a name that he used, and it was not Buddha. He was known also as Sakyamuni long before he was ever called Buddha, that the word Buddha is kind of a late-age thing. Okay, that he was Sakyamuni to King Asoka. But the question is, is what did he refer to himself. Yes. And the answer is the Tathagata. Have you ever heard that word before?

**Speaker B:** I've heard that word before. I, I didn't— when I heard it, I was like, okay, I'm, I'm watching this video or whatever, that word sounds important. But, you know, I, I kept watching the video and then I forgot to look it up. What does it mean?

**Speaker A:** Well, the word Tathagata has the word of tatatha and the word go in it. The word tatatha is the word that in old days they translated as thusness. And so that's the kind of word that it's got stuck into the English language. And that misses the point completely. But if you think of it instead of thusness as thisness, because thus is not even a word in our vocabulary, but when it is used correctly, it's like the thus or that which was necessary to show. And here it is. This is it. Okay. That's in fact what it really means. This is it or this here or here now. So Ram Dass uses the expression be here now. And also Eckhart Tolle uses the phrase this present moment. In fact, I think that he's even got a book by the name of The Power of This Present Moment.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, The Power of Now.

**Speaker A:** I've read The Power of Now. All right, so this is what the Buddha is teaching, is the teaching of the one who goes into right now, or go now. Which means come out of the mind into the reality that we have right in front of us, to be here rather than in the past. But normally when we're thinking in conceptualized thoughts, we're reconstructing old memories. When we're writing an email, we're planning or constructing a future thing that we're not doing. Oftentimes people think about writing an email while they're not writing it. They go write it later. What they write is generally not what they were thinking they were going to write. Yeah, they write something else. So why think about writing the email? Why don't we just either don't write the email for a while and then write it as we were, or as soon as we think about the email, we just write it then and get it over with? But no, we think and we think and we think and we write and we unwrite and we write again and all that. We never do write that email for quite a while, days or so, and we're worried and afraid the whole time with expectations. I've got a job to do, I've got to get it done. But that's just one example. How many things have you done that with in your life? Going to the bank?

**Speaker B:** Oh, I mean, I was a big perfectionist. A lot of that's changed over time, still to some degree, But especially with my writing, I'll go back and edit and, oh, this doesn't sound just quite right. So let's, you know, okay, well, there's

**Speaker A:** a new attitude to take, and that is that you can see that writing not as writing and correcting it and making small errors and whatnot. Think of it as a toy that you're playing with. Just play with it.

**Speaker B:** I don't really see it as a negative thing. I kind of enjoy perfecting the way that I'm trying to say it.

**Speaker A:** That's what we're getting at, that you have that choice. A lot of writers would rather have writer's block than enjoy editing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I, I like editing, um, but I don't really have writer's block. It's just like Well, maybe you can write a course.

**Speaker A:** You can start a whole new university of writing skills, because that's— I know what writer's block is. I'm completely blocked, 100%. So anyway, back to what we were talking about, and that is that when we come out of our dissatisfactions, when we see what we're doing, we can change our mind and move out of the First and Second Noble Truth into the Third Noble Truth. And this is something that's not taught in Western Buddhism because nobody really recognizes— everybody's kind of afraid of the Third Noble Truth. Because they keep thinking they ain't got it, where in fact you can have it anytime you want it. Anytime that you're not in dissatisfaction, you could be in satisfaction. And that's what the Buddha teaches, is being free from dissatisfaction in this moment, not permanently. Permanently is the way Westerners think. We're only interested— but it's a— now

**Speaker B:** it's a moment-to-moment recognition and decision shift that I'm— as soon as I'm out of dissatisfaction, I can be in that satisfaction. And that is ultimately the goal, more or less.

**Speaker A:** Well, since it's instantly available, it's not a goal. Yeah, it's like there's the cup of coffee and you want to drink a sip of coffee, you just take the cup. Doesn't become a goal for you. I mean, you're not

**Speaker B:** The cup doesn't become a goal.

**Speaker A:** No, it's just there it is, you just take it.

**Speaker B:** That's funny. I don't know what— it's funny. That made me laugh more than I expected. Maybe that's the super mundane Dharma working its wonders.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the whole point, that we see things as a goal, which means we see something as in this particular moment in time, I don't have the goal. It's way out there someplace, which means I'm incomplete because I haven't got the goal right now. And so I'm actually in a state of dissatisfaction by having a goal.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, uh, but instead of making a stupid cliché like the goal is to have no goals, because that's still a goal.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, then you're just in koan territory,

**Speaker A:** and, and, and you can start chasing your tail with that one. In fact, there's a term for it, it's called desiring desirelessness.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I've done that plenty of times, right? I'm all— I've heard these things I'm not a stranger to them.

**Speaker A:** Well, then the thing that we need to do now is to be on guard, to look for that stuff so that whenever it comes up, we can say, hey, I don't need that right now. And we can do that throughout the day, any day, any time of the day. We can make that choice. Am I either going to react to this and do the same things that I've always done, or am I going to make a choice about how I think and how I feel about it? That this is the whole teaching of Kamma as far as the Buddha is concerned and the way that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa has it. But the Buddhist world, the Western Buddhist world, has a very Hindu idea of Kamma, Kamma Vipaka, or in the sense of you've heard it like this: if you do good action, you'll get good results. If you do a bad action, you'll get a bad result. Okay. Is that true or not? Okay. There's some— it is mostly true on the surface, at least. But the problem is when they add a third line to that poem, and the third line is, no matter what,

**Speaker B:** or no matter what. Okay.

**Speaker A:** No matter what, which is not true. That generally a good action will give a good result and a bad action will give a bad result. But who's to determine, or how is it determined that an action is good? That in fact, the way that Western world looks in the sense of cause and effect, and I assume the Buddha did too, is we determine that an act was good because of the results. You invest in the stock market and the stock goes up. And you sell it, then that stying of that stock was a good move. But if you buy a stock and it goes down and you sell it, or even while it's going down, you feel bad because you think that that was a bad move giving a bad result. Well, actually, it was the result that we were looking at. It was a bad result. We didn't know when we made that move or when we bought that stock whether it was going to go up or not. It was just hope. In fact, we were starting with greed by buying that stock. And when it goes up, we think it was a good move. And when it goes down, we think it was a bad move. So was it a good move in the beginning? Good. And the way that it's stated is good action gives good results. But we don't even know what a good action is. We have to wait for the results to find out what the action was. But the action by itself is undetermined because we've got an idea of what we want to be the result. We've got a plan, we've got a hope. We hope the stock goes up, then it was a good move. And we don't want it to go down, and if it does, then it was a bad move. Okay, there's another possibility with that, and that is, is that imagine that you're at a, um, let us say a tournament, um, the World Series, or the Super Bowl or something like that, and the guy makes a touchdown, but no, the penalty goes on the flag. And half the people jump up and down and cheer, oh, I'm so glad he threw that penalty flag.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's a good example.

**Speaker A:** And the other team, the other half jump up and down and they hate that penalty. All right, so was that penalty— was that a good act or not? Not— never mind whether it was correct or not. We're not asking about whether it was correct or whether it was true or whether it— uh, the videotape— how is—

**Speaker B:** how does the result— what was the result to people? How do people interpret the result? Because that's ultimately what is determining whether people think— think it's a good or bad action over time. And that it just continues on.

**Speaker A:** Exactly correct. All right. And so this, the whole issue of Kamma then becomes quite an irrelevant teaching until we just— until we go into it deeper. That in fact, the Buddha begins to teach then that there is mixed action, like that flag that went down. That's mixed. Also the buying of the stock, that's a mixed action. But there is a fourth kind of action that's neither bright nor dark. It's not mixed. And in fact, it's neither one, that we can go around living our lives without expecting results. We can just be in the present moment and just let this be an action that is free from that. In fact, if I am not wanting anything, then the actions that I have will not be in the greed of wanting anything. So in general, I'm not hurting anyone. And if I am not expecting anything out of my actions, like Tom Boone or giving a donation or trying to help some organization to do something good, that I can just give them money because I like it and get my benefit right then and there. Then I'm not operating out of that whole idea of Kamma and the results of Kamma, because I'm getting the results right now. That Kamma and the result of Kamma is instant, that it has a cause and effect relationship, that that's what the Buddha was actually talking about, that he mentioned that specifically.

**Speaker B:** So you're talking about a cause and effect kind of dance happening right now,

**Speaker A:** right in the present moment. Cause and effect is not just happening right now, but it's happening trillions of times in a trillionth of a second.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I get. Yeah, that makes me think about something that I— just something that came to me one day. I just thought this process of spiritual development or enlightenment, it ultimately felt to me right to say that you're closer to a noun— or sorry, you're closer to a verb than a noun. And that's like you're losing that self, the self-view and preservation, and then you become this process and you're just kind of doing this dance and you get so attuned to it that, yeah, the past, it's not even really in consideration, neither is the future. It's just this is so immediate and the more you're in that, yeah, the less problems there are generally. I mean, you can have problems in that, in a personal way probably, but—

**Speaker A:** If you're not watching where you're going. Yeah, but a way that you're expressing it can be also expressed this way: that life is not a march, it's a waltz.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And when we think of it as a march, that means we're going someplace. To where in a waltz we're just having fun, we're just dancing around. Yeah, that there really is no place to go. We're just having fun here.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I forget who it was, but someone asked a master from some tradition, uh, you know, what's, what's the purpose of, of life or the, the spiritual path? And he says, he just says, to play. That's all I said.

**Speaker A:** One of the old Zen stories is that the young Zen monk comes into the hall where the old Zen master is sitting and says, Master, Master, are you meditating in order to become enlightened? The old master opened one eye and said, No, I'm just sitting here because I'm already enlightened. Just sitting here. That's the whole point of zazen. There's no place to go, nothing to do, just sitting here.

**Speaker B:** I watched a video a couple weeks ago on zazen. There was a monk getting interviewed and he spoke about something his master had said and told him. He said, zazen, good for nothing.

**Speaker A:** That's exactly right. It's very, very good. And what you get out of it is nothing. It's very good to get a whole bunch of nothing.

**Speaker B:** And yeah, a lot of it was getting around that goal idea, but he also was saying there's a certain koan element to it because you're still choosing to sit down.

**Speaker A:** It's only a koan when there is confusion. That's what the word koan actually is pointing at, is here's a riddle for you to solve. And if you're confused, it takes a while. But if you, if you hear it that way, you just think like a Gordian knot, you'll just cut right through that. There's nothing to it.

**Speaker B:** No. So koans only exist when you don't know, when you don't see it. Well, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So, um, there's also that Zen point about you're already enlightened. Just sit here. There's nothing to attain. Just sit here. Already enlightened. Okay, but what that means then is that when we want something, then our meditation practice is all about greed. We're practicing being greedy for something. We're practicing for being dissatisfied.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** and I know that seems satisfied.

**Speaker B:** I know that's something you talked about with, yeah, the, especially, you know, the, like the Four Path model and that sets you up for that type of thing, that chasing, you get it. And that I experienced that, you know, because I had, you know, as far as the descriptions, at the very least what Daniel Ingram calls stream entry. I had fruition or cessation, which is really the way that he determines that. Well, he comes out of the history,

**Speaker A:** he comes out— go ahead.

**Speaker B:** It makes me feel like I, you know, okay, I got this, and things feel to be much better in a sense, and a sense of understanding and control and the feeling of everything, and being present, whatever. But now it's like I've got all these other people who are these experts in Buddhism telling me, okay, there's all these higher levels and you're here and it doesn't matter how good that feels or doesn't. Like there's all this and you got to go here. And that's kind of— and of course, like I've always been a kind of high achiever in some ways. Yeah, I basically— I'll be honest, I'm like a high achiever as long as I can do the least work to get there. That's just my personality.

**Speaker A:** And that's— well, that sounds like far too much work for me.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that sounds like— well, I mean,

**Speaker A:** so what we can say then is all of these different things that people present as Buddhism wind up being just more doodads on the box. Or another way of saying it is that these are actually rabbit holes that people go down thinking that they can

**Speaker B:** get— they feel like a rabbit hole more than a doodad on the box. In my experience, it's a pretty— you go— I've been in, uh, well, I would say in that sense I've been a very active rabbit. For the past few months.

**Speaker A:** Well, you've seen the interior of a lot of rabbit holes. Now it's time to start taking a good look at the interior of your own mind. Yeah. And in the process of doing that, it's a cleaning out job. And that the only thing that you have to clean out is this particular unwholesome thought that you're having right now. Okay, that's the way.

**Speaker B:** It's not some giant personality consistency of I've got this condition and that condition and this has happened in my life. It's no, this is right here. What is the direct problem? You deal with that in the best way you can and then you go to the next moment. And that seems very practical to me.

**Speaker A:** And of course That's what it is. It's a practical method of coming out of one's dissatisfaction in life. That this is in fact the whole Four Noble Truths, is that there is a procedure, a method of spending this moment to come out of Dukkha right now and become in a state of Sukkha. That Sukkha and Dukkha are direct opposites. So the Third Noble Truth is getting ourselves into a state of satisfaction. Getting ourselves in the state of comfort, into a state of pleasure, into a state that feels safe and secure. That's all we need to do. And if we can do that over and over and over and over again, we begin to build confidence that I can do this anytime I want to. And with that confidence comes an exhilaration of Success. I can do this.

**Speaker B:** What are your thoughts on practices like Vipassana, for example?

**Speaker A:** Like, well, the dry Vipassana that is taught in Western Mahayana style is dry because they don't have any Sukkha. They do it with Dukkha, and all they investigate is Dukkha. So you could actually say that their teachings of the Buddha is Dukkha Dukkha, dukkha, more dukkha, look at it closely, there it is, inspect it, get some real detail about that dukkha and see how that dukkha creates this dukkha and then look at it for a while and get some dukkha there. See, that never made sense to me.

**Speaker B:** When I was doing Vipassana in their style, I could get no-self rather easily, notice no-self in sensations. Yeah, that's not too hard to see the consistency of that. Impermanence. Yeah, everything's changing all the time. It might last for 5 seconds, but in that 5 seconds, your attention is going to go to your— the itch in your foot and the sound of the car outside, the thing up here, a little itch in your head here. And when you're able to see all those jumps, you're like, well, that, that solid little pain thing I was worried about just went away. But I noticed that when I was trying to examine Dukkha, it didn't make sense in being a consistent thing all the time. Because you see, okay, there are times when I feel happiness, Sukkha, satisfied. And I'm trying to investigate this Dukkha that's supposed to be here at 24/7 the way that it's described.

**Speaker A:** Not like— in the suttas, there's no concept of 24/7.

**Speaker B:** But that's the way that they present it in these Western Buddhist concepts.

**Speaker A:** That's the Western mindset of everything is black or white. Better way of saying it is that there's a ratio. Sometimes you feel like a nut and sometimes you don't. If you start looking at that, you can feel like you don't have to feel like a nut if you don't want to, but you feel like a nut sometimes and sometimes you don't. And life's just a mix. It's up and down and up and down. And we're not cognizant of the upping and the downing. All we're cognizant of is that we don't like it when it goes down and we do like it when it goes up. Rather than recognizing that we're in a cycle of Samsara and it keeps going up and going down, and whether I like it or not is my choice. So another way of talking about the teaching is that we can actually define the teachings of the Buddha down to just one word in several cases. One would be choice. If you recognize in this particular instant you have a choice about how you're going to spend this particular instant, then that can— and you remember that you have a choice. And in fact, you take the big choice that I can make the choice any time I want to make the choice. And that's the entire teaching of the Buddha. You got a choice about whether you're going to feel dissatisfied or not.

**Speaker B:** That's a pretty liberating concept just in itself, put really simply in a way that I've not heard in all this other stuff I've been looking at. It's you've got a choice in how you feel. It's that simple. And you got that, and you have that choice right now. And that's always where you make the decision is in the right now.

**Speaker A:** Right. Well, you've always had the choice, but we are so deeply ingrained in the habits that we've had. That it's hard to recognize because we've made the same choice over and over again, that we have a new choice to make. And in fact, our choices that we've been making have turned out to be not choices. They wind up being habits. Okay. We made those choices originally when in diapers, and we still make the same choice over and over again because of habit. Now it's time to wake up and recognize that we don't have to make that same choice over and over again. We can choose to make a new choice every moment that we can remember to. This is what Sati is in, because now we're talking coming out of that Third Noble Truth into the Fourth Noble Truth. And this is something that we're going to spend more time on in the sense of when we understand how the Four Noble Truths work together, then we can say, oh, this is how all of this works. And then we can go down into it. All right. And so the very first point about the Eightfold Noble Path is that this is a noble path, and yet it's almost always practiced in an ordinary way by ordinary people for a long time before they finally get the wisdom that it takes, that this is actually a path of wisdom. It is not a path of morality. It's not a path of concentration or meditation or anything. It's a path of wisdom.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And this is where the wisdom— this is where the path starts, is with wisdom. And wisdom in the sense of investigation, in the sense of looking and looking. The Mahasi Method calls this noting because they don't have all of the ingredients, but they do have that piece of the puzzle, the noting. The question is, is once you do note, when did you note? That's the next question. When do you note? The answer is every time you remember the note, but the Western person's answer is all the time, and they can't do that, so they're setting themselves up for failure. And so they're going to wind up in dissatisfaction when they have the idea of all the time, rather than doing it when you remember to do it. So that means that when you remember to do it, you can congratulate yourself for remembering, rather than fussing at yourself for forgetting. Westerners are already trained in that critical thinking of fussing at ourselves when we remember, because that means that we remember that we have forgotten, and we fuss at ourselves for forgetting rather than congratulating ourselves for remembering.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And so noting

**Speaker A:** is to note, am I congratulating myself or am I punishing myself for having woken up in this instant.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so do you call noting such as, like, Joseph Goldstein— I was listening, he was talking about, you know, he would, you know, put his foot down and he'd note that, and then lift it up and note that, and place it down and note that. Is that the kind of style? And is this happening as like you literally think like a thought in your head, like lift foot, middle motion of foot, place foot, because that's the way I've seen it presented in some places. And then Daniel Ingram says that you can note without words if you're doing like fast noting. I've seen a whole range of this kind of stuff in the Western Buddhist

**Speaker A:** teaching. Let us start at least with the point of the movement of the foot and that sort of thing comes out of a particular literature that's 1,000 years after the time of the Buddha. It has its value, but it misses the point. Okay, it has its value. It is a way of training the mind for Sati, so that how often we note can be improved. We want to improve the frequency of how often we note. We also want to improve the power of our noting in the sense— and this is where they're often missing— do you have the power of the noting, or the Sati is strong enough to make a change. And yet what they're doing here is that the noting that we're doing is because you're changing the way that you're moving your foot. By noting it, you're changing it, but also by stepping in a particular way. That, in fact, the book is all about moving the heel first, going to the end step, then the rising of the foot, then the moving of the foot, then the planting of the foot with either the heel or the sole, and then letting the whole foot come down. Yes, all of that stuff does happen, and we can notice that. And then we can do that by starting off walking very, very slowly, and then we can begin to do that walking naturally. And yet in Western meditation, the idea, oh, you've got to slow way down, you got to slow way down and note and note and note and note. You see. And so they kind of miss the point and everything. But the real issue of the noting is, is that when, when we're noting what needs to be noted, we are noting it within the context of the body, within the context of the feeling, within the context of what is happening in the mind, and in the context of what the state of mind is. And so the whole Satipatthana is there. And this one little piece of it, of watching the foot, now has become what you understand about the Sati or the waking up or this whole practice. That in fact, that's just one example of many of the things that another one is, is that you can become mindful of your breathing. And in this case, you're also going to slow it down. So that the mindfulness actually is taking control, just like you're taking control of the way that you're walking and slowing it down and really watching every piece of the step. You're also going to learn to do that with your breathing. We're also going to learn to do that with the mind, and we're also going to learn to do that with our feelings. So it's not just the foot that we're going to note. That's just an example.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. But another point about it is, is that this noting that the Mahasi Method is actually talking about has to be done correctly when the mind is already in the right state of mind, when the mind is already fit for work. Now the question is, what are you going to note? The other way of practice is the dry insight method. Is what do you know? You note whatever is there. But the correct way of practice is that that's how we start. But we do it immediately, like something like 1 second after we do that. The next thing we do after the noting is the determination: is this thought is worth having or not. And sometimes it's worth having, and sometimes it's not. Sometimes you're having a relaxing, happy thought, sometimes you're not. Check it out. Keep watching what the mind is doing. And when the mind is thinking about something other than what's happening right here, right now, because the Western mind is trained to think about the past and think about the future, plans and fixing problems and all of that kind of stuff. But a really good wholesome thought would be thoughts about what's happening right now, to be here now. Tathagata, those are wholesome thoughts. So what kind of thoughts would be wholesome would be by watching your foot as it's moving. Another one would be watching your breath as it's breathing in and out. Another one would be keeping the mind gladdened and bright and in the present moment. And so it's not a matter of noting whatever is there, but whether we're going to start controlling what we're noting. But this actually— Western Buddhism seems to be a no-skin-in-the-game kind of passive observer practice, a passive practice, to where the actual teaching of the Buddha is an active practice. You put skin in the game. You got to take control of things. If you're going to make some changes, you're going to have to make some changes. You're going to have to put some effort into it. And that right effort is the part— that's one of the missing pieces of the puzzle, is one's right effort.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. And the effort is, is to take out unwholesome thoughts. And put wholesome thoughts in the mind. The first job that we need to do is remove the hindrances, to remove the restless mind, to remove the worries from the mind, to remove all the doubts from the mind, to remove all of the duties of the mind, like I got to go do this and I got to go do that, removing all of the desires of the mind. This is being free from the hindrances. And the way to do that is by paying attention to what you're doing on the outside and the reality right now. You're watching your foot is a whole much healthier thing to do than to not be paying attention while you're thinking about the argument that you had with your Aunt Susie or something.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So we begin to then pay attention to what's going on, and that's one of the things that we can pay attention to. Is how our foot moves. You can also pay attention to the hands, that that's in fact in the sutta also, that walking, standing, reaching, touching, all of that kind of stuff is to become mindful. And one of the ways of becoming mindful of the hands is again by intentionally slowing them down, that we don't just grab stuff. That we begin to move slowly, carefully, doing with our hands directly, mindfully what we're doing with them. So this is all part of the practice of to be here now with the body, the feelings, and the mind, and the mind's objects, the Satipatthana, the Four Foundations, Kayanupassana, Vedana, Upadana, Citta, Upadana, and dominant passion. Now, how do we get started with that? That's the question. Is it— well, it's actually a sequence of events that happen in the mind. A lot of people think that all the Satipatthana and Anapanasati practice of the Satipatthana is a great big thing, and that I have to practice for years this and then years that and then years that other stuff to where in fact the whole body and mind feeling complex goes into the meditation hall with you. You can't leave the mind and the feelings in the bed and take the body in to the meditation hall. You've got to take it all in because we're going to operate with all of it within a few seconds of each other. There's this kind of a sequence that we're going to go into, and this sequence is done according to the Eightfold Noble Path of investigating what's going on remembering to investigate what's going on, most specifically the mind. And then we change the mind from an unwholesome thought to a wholesome thought, and then congratulate ourselves for changing it. Or we congratulate ourselves for the fact that it was already a wholesome thought. But in both cases, we congratulate ourselves for the job well done. The mind in this thought is now in a wholesome state. One of the ways that I tell the students is that you have spent your whole life talking yourself into feeling bad, and now it's time to talk yourself into feeling good.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I like that. This is a lot— it's a much different approach than than that constant seeking. I need to be this or that to be that ultimate happy level.

**Speaker A:** No, it's— So this is the practice then of Anapanasati, is to remember Sati, to wake up and to look at what the mind is doing and then gladden the mind. That's one's right effort. Is to gladden the mind, perk the mind up. There's many different ways to do this. Next time when you call, we'll talk about the various ways of gladdening the mind and what are wholesome and unwholesome thoughts. But you're probably pretty good at it already. You can determine whether a thought is wholesome or not if you inspect it, if you see it. And so once we see that thought, now we change it into a wholesome thought. And the wholesome thought has to do with the fact that I do feel safe. I don't have to feel afraid. I can feel safe right now. It's not dangerous. I can have a wholesome thought if I'm comfortable. I don't have to sit long time before my knees hurt and my back hurts. And this is meditation, kind of painful sitting postures, but rather maintain comfort. Make sure that you're comfortable, because if you're not comfortable, you're not going to be able to be satisfied. If you don't feel safe and secure, you can't feel satisfied. So safety, security, and comfort are prerequisites for feeling satisfaction. And this feeling of safety, security, comfort, and satisfaction is actually the technical definition of the word Sukkha, which is exactly opposite of the word Dukkha, which is unsatisfactory. And now we're making the moment satisfying. We're making it satisfactory right this very moment with only 3 out of the Eightfold Noble that. Only the first three, and we're already in the Third Noble Truth.

**Speaker B:** There's a path out of suffering, and that's not necessarily by viewing everything as suffering all the time, in the Dukkha, Vipassana style.

**Speaker A:** That's another issue, is the word path, because when we hear the word path, we automatically think of it as a path or a way or a trail or a highway or a destination. Here to there, here to there. In fact, that's just a bad translation of, um, uh, uh, the word Marga means, uh, It means like method or a way of doing things. The example that I use is that there is a door and you want to go into the house, you want to open the door. There's a simple procedure: you put the key in, you turn the lock, you turn the handle, and you push the door open. That's all there is to it. There's not much of desires and dissatisfactions in getting the door open if you can open it. Now, if you try to turn the key and it won't work, it's the wrong key, or the door is stuck, now you're in a state of dissatisfaction because you're wanting to open the door and you can't. But if you know how to open the door, all you have to do is put the key in, turn the key, turn the crank, open the door, and there you are. This can happen in a second or two. And many people in the West get the idea that, yeah, that's all there is to open that door. Unfortunately, that door door's 100 miles from here. And so now there's a path to the door, where in fact the door is right here in front of you. Here it is. And all we have to do is unlock the door. All we have to do is come out of our dissatisfactions and turn it immediately into satisfaction. The Buddha had a phrase for that. The phrase that he used— in fact, this is a very key ingredient into the way of putting it all together, and it's a very famous phrase. And then there's, aha, I see you, Mara, which is basically saying, aha, I see the door is closed. And so all we have to do then— aha, I see you, Mara— is in fact, aha, I see you, Mara, is already coming out of it. That's a wholesome thought now. Yep. Yeah. Aha, I see you. Why? Because when we were in it, we were it. I was that thought. That was who I am. And now I can come out of it and say, aha, I see you. So it's like this, that there is a thought and there's the me attached to that thought. And then we wake up and we say, aha, I see you. We're putting some separation. We're becoming super mundane. We're now not in that world. We're above that world. Aha, I see you. This is the expression, and that takes us immediately out of Dukkha. You're out. There you are. The next question though is, what are you going to do in the next mind moment? Go back to this again? Are you going to have a dance? I'm out, I'm out, I see you. Your choice.

**Speaker B:** I know the dance sounds better to me than taking on the what kind of sucks.

**Speaker A:** Take a mental victory dance. That's the gladdening of the mind, is taking a mental victory lap. And by doing so, you begin to change the way you feel. You literally talk yourself into feeling good. Aha, I see what I'm doing, rather than, oh, there it goes again, because that's the normal way. We see Dukkha and then we just have more Dukkha because we had Dukkha, that we remember that we forgot. And so now we're chastising ourselves for having forgotten instead of congratulating ourselves for remembering. Yeah. So this is the skill of Sati. It's the right kind of Sati, is a wake-up call, wakey wakey, aha, I see you. That's the practice. And this is just the first thing we do. The next thing that we do is then we take a deep breath. That's also part of one's right effort. And now we begin to start breathing long and breathing out long intentionally, because we're now putting Sati, we're putting some skin in the game. If I try to note the breath without putting anything into it, I'm just going to passively catch it, the mind will just trot right away because it's got no skin in the game. It's got no reason to stay there. It's hard work to stay there when the mind is actually flipping out someplace. So becoming curious and interested in what's happening in this present moment will give the mind an opportunity to be here now, curious and curiously inspecting what's happening right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, at least like entering that for, you know, several seconds, that kind of meditation seems a hell of a lot easier and more effective than what I was trying to do before? Well,

**Speaker A:** I've only added a couple of missing pieces. You already knew that, right?

**Speaker B:** Because what I was doing before was, was, you know, still doing a lot of stuff. I mean, it was— it wasn't, you know, it wasn't like a toy gun.

**Speaker A:** You were setting yourself up.

**Speaker B:** It was like a musket or something instead of a machine gun.

**Speaker A:** Well, You basically, you were by being so excellent at spotting Dukkha, so excellent in the noting, that all you begin to see is Dukkha, Dukkha, Dukkha everywhere. But here we're taking exactly the opposite, is as soon as we see the dukkha, we're throwing it out. As soon as we see the unwholesome thought, we're throwing it out and coming into the here-now immediately and getting instant Immediate results, and we begin to like it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** but here we're liking something that we have rather than liking something that we want to have.

**Speaker B:** Big difference.

**Speaker A:** Big difference. And so we become satisfied with this present moment. It's good enough. This is what we need to practice, is practice that this is okay. What's happening right now, it's all right. Because if it's not all right, then that means that you're giving yourself a lot of work to do for nothing, when you could just sit here and enjoy nothing at all. And so there's no place to go and nothing to do. And the spring comes and the grass grows by itself, doesn't need our help. We can just sit here. Everything's okay, everything's easy peasy, everything is gushy. Everything is warm and fuzzy, and we begin to nurture ourselves. Everything's okay, everything's fine, not a care in the world, not a worry, no dangers, no expectations. At this present moment is just nice. And this is how we practice, just getting ourselves into a nice happy state. And then learning to begin to maintain that, as well as building the skill of maintaining that, we're also building and maintaining and expanding the confidence that we have that we can do this, that this is my practice, it's satisfying. And with then becomes the attitude, I can do this, I can do it.

**Speaker B:** I mean, just just being on the call with you this far, I've gone from feeling like meditation is like almost impossible and I'm going to do all these other spiritual methods. And it's not to say that I'm going to stop doing those now, but I felt like I had to go everywhere else other than meditation because it was just something I couldn't handle. Like just sitting down and being with it. I could do it for maybe, I don't know, 15, 30 minutes. The longer it goes, it just got worse and worse usually. Because what would happen is I would do, you know, like Vipassana or something and I would get some type of positive result and it would feel good. And then, you know, for example, one thing they're telling you to actively look at if a bliss sensation comes up, which happens to me, you know, all the time. If some big bliss sensation comes up, you know, bliss running down your leg and the side of your body or in your head or whatever, you look at it with this Dukkha lens. Like, I'm trying to see how this beautiful bliss right now that I'm experiencing is dissatisfactory because it's impermanent. And then I'm automatically looking into the future and the past to even have that impermanent thought to tie in that it's going to be dissatisfactory. Because the truth of the thing is, it's not dissatisfactory in that moment. The sensation of that, the natural way that that plays out is, dang, this feels pretty good. But when you get in that mindset of I'm gonna go at it and dismantle it so I can keep going further and further. Right.

**Speaker A:** The students, many of them work very hard. Their effort is strong, but it's not right and it's not noble. Other people don't work enough. And in fact, everybody is going back and forth on the seesaw between not enough effort and too much effort. Yeah, um, instead of just the right effort every time, just, just the easy right effort, just the minimal amount effort to actually get the job done. That's going to right effort, and it's an easy thing to do, and that is just to take a deep breath and just change what you're thinking into wholesome thought. That's all there is to it. Now, one of the things that we know about humanity is, is that there's an attention span And that someday we can go into some of the details of it. But right now we can just look at the fact that generally speaking, 20 minutes is about the attention span for humans. And then the mind gets tired. And that the best 20 minutes of a class is the first 20 minutes, unless the teacher or the students are skilled enough. To stay there for a whole hour, but for your poor 4th graders or not.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So the meditation system then that came out of Burma was basically for people who were much more senior at it, and yet they begin beginners with sitting for an hour and none of them can do it. And they all wind up wasting most of that time in misery, suffering, and in fact sitting in a posture that their body is not used to. And so they're in pain and discomfortable. I mean, it's just, it's a kind of a torture chamber.

**Speaker B:** That's what it seemed like when I heard everybody's like these 10-day Vipassana retreats and stuff. And I'm just thinking, you know, I have ADHD and you know, other stuff going on. But like, if I would just picture myself, I was thinking realistically, like, doing what I'm doing right now, if I go to this 10-day retreat or whatever, I'm gonna— my attention is gonna crack within like an hour and a half, almost guaranteed. I knew that about myself.

**Speaker A:** And then you're going to be unhappy in a place where you went to be happy. Then you're going to be really unhappy. You're going to crack. I heard that word.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I was going to— I knew that I would crack and it would be that, that I would have to open my eyes or walk around or something, that sitting still in that posture and whatever in that way, I would have to change. That's always been what it was, is that the meditation hasn't been It just hasn't been enough to hold my attention usually, except for after, you know, my first cessation. There was a time when I meditated for about 2 days straight, like maybe ate like one time a day and then a few glasses of water. And that was basically it. And I was doing it because I was really enjoying the states that I was in and investigating them further. But I think it's really hard to keep up with that if when you're not at— I think a lot of that came because after the cessation or whatever, it created a heightened kind of baseline state that I was in. And then it made things— it made the practice more, more full of Sukkha, I would say.

**Speaker A:** And then precisely so. Yes, exactly.

**Speaker B:** Here's what happened. I was able to just do it, you know, for— I mean, way more than I ever could have in a 2-day period before. I mean, it was all day, like both days. I was off work, everything, just laid on my couch and was just, just relaxed as I could be. And, and, um, just, it was great.

**Speaker A:** But, but yeah, it was great. You hear that? That, that was in the past. That this is one of the big dangers, is that people will have, after a whole lot of work, they'll finally let go then have a good moment, and to now, they, uh, the next meditation time, they want that again. And so now they go into the meditation wanting something that they don't have, and so they're striving to get something they don't have. All right, there's a better way of practicing in the situation that, that you're, that you're in, and that, that would be, um Thinking about it in the sense that after a meditation retreat at Dukkha, and I think others, they say it's good to practice for an hour a day. And if you're really good at it, you can practice 2, and if you're really, really good at it, you can practice 3 hours a day. All right. That's the way that they talk. And so all the students have this idea of an hour, but the Buddha didn't have clocks. What he had was josticks. Or incense, which lasts about 20 minutes on average, at least the ones that are manufactured nowadays, which is about the same time as attention span. So what it would be better for you to do is to start breaking your meditation up into smaller periods of time more frequently. So if you're going to put in 60 minutes a day, then We could do that in 4 15-minute sessions, or maybe even better, 6 10-minute sessions, because you ought to be able to get yourself into a great deal of nice place, very happy, in 10 minutes. You do that 6 times a day, you can get yourself into a really happy state.

**Speaker B:** You'll probably want to keep doing that.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so this is the way to The practice is to get yourself into a really good state often, to get away from it all. Close your eyes, get yourself into a nice, comfortable posture and start watching the mind, cleaning it out and start gladdening the mind and giving yourself some nurturing thoughts. Everything's okay right now. I don't have to do anything for the next 8 or 9 minutes. I don't go anywhere. I'm just going to sit here and chill. Just chill, baby, chill. Relaxed, easygoing, no place to go and nothing to do. That whole point about chill, baby, chill is the actual definition of Nibbana. And yet we have made it magical, like the word enlightenment or Arahant or stream entry. We just put those things way up there with some plastic Jesus.

**Speaker B:** Way up there, someplace. That's true. I definitely did that. I definitely did that.

**Speaker A:** And yet Nibbana is nothing but just chilling out. Just cool off, try in. Everything's all right, everything's cool. Take the heat out of the mind, the unwholesome thoughts. And when you take the unwholesome hot thoughts out then the body will naturally relax and cool, chill out. So this is the basic of, or the understanding of it. The next time that you call, we'll go a little bit deeper and see how this actually fits into the Anapanasati Sutta and how it's to be practiced. But this is basically the idea, is just sit down and remember to chill out. And then we'll get some unwholesome thoughts again in that 10 minutes. Never mind, I can chill, I can chill, and just keep chilling for about 10 minutes. Yeah, become satisfied and content and safe and comfortable. And when you're really like that, then that's what you can do. I mean, that's what we could call chilling out. That's chilling. If you're unsatisfied or if you're afraid or if you're uncomfortable, that's not chilling out.

**Speaker B:** See, I've always been good at chilling out. I just never was good at meditation because I didn't realize it was chilling out.

**Speaker A:** All right, that's what meditation is. It's just learning how to chill out professionally, practice the skill.

**Speaker B:** Chill out professionally. Professional chill. Yeah, I'm a professional chill master.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, I think that we've gotten enough now for you to get a different idea and start practicing and adding these ingredients in and breaking it up so that instead of sitting for long periods of time, you can sit for short periods of time and gain some real satisfaction out of it, gain some real joy. Oh, I like this. And so practice that for a while, and then you can call and we can continue on with some more of the details of it. But basically it's the same thing over and over and over and over again. It needs that repetitive quality. As I said before, you have been literally 20 more years now talking yourself over and over and over again into feeling bad. So now we have to repeat over and over and over again to chill,

**Speaker B:** condition all of that, in a sense,

**Speaker A:** make that change, to remember to make that change. I don't have to be thinking about hot thoughts, I can think about chill thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Well, I think that, I mean, that seems very helpful. I can see it's probably going to make things a lot easier to actually start practicing.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the whole point, is making your life easy, easy peasy. Why do you have to have so much work working hard and try and all that kind of language when we can just say, yeah, I've got that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Well, is there anything else you want to say, or do you just want me to reach out maybe in a, I don't know, a week or two,

**Speaker A:** or how long Yeah, um, let us say, uh, a half a week to a week, something like that. 3, 4 days, 5 days, that neighborhood, that'd be fine. Once a week would be okay. Up to you. All right, well, but the more you call, the more we'll repeat it, and the better your practice will be. The more often you call, the better your results.

**Speaker B:** Well, I have no, no issue calling often right now. So, um, if you've got the time, I'll, I'll definitely fit it in there too.

**Speaker A:** Well, we'll have to fit you in because that happens too. Sometimes we have 2 or 3 people calling. Yeah, but in fact, we have, um, several calls a week where we invite, uh, anyone to come join it. Um, multiple person Yeah, it's called the Sangha, and we have a U.S. Sangha and a UK Sangha. Okay. And so you could join the UK Sangha. It's on Friday evenings. You're in Central Time, and so that's Eastern, actually. But okay, you're in Eastern Time. Okay, so you're an hour ahead. If you're in Eastern Time, that would mean 10 PM on Friday night. And that's true so that people at 7 in Pacific time— so Pacific is 7 Mountain.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so 10 PM every Friday, or every Friday?

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh.

**Speaker B:** 10 PM every Friday. Um, and that's on— it's on you,

**Speaker A:** it's on Skype, it's on Skype.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I didn't know you could— yeah, I guess you can do group on Skype. Okay, cool.

**Speaker A:** They added that.

**Speaker B:** I just sent you a message at that time then. Just send you a message.

**Speaker A:** You just joined the call.

**Speaker B:** Okay, where do I get the information?

**Speaker A:** Well, just like in Skype when you got me, you typed in the name. So here you type in T-H-E space S-A-N-G-H-A space U-S.

**Speaker B:** Okay, the Sangha U.S. The Sangha U.S. with With periods or not?

**Speaker A:** No, no periods.

**Speaker B:** No periods. Okay, The Sangha US.

**Speaker A:** Okay, nothing ever ends. We don't put any periods or stops or anything in there.

**Speaker B:** All right, well,

**Speaker A:** um, and I can send you a link, but that's the easy way to find it. In fact, in the description, sir, should be a a link in the description of the videos. Do you know about the videos?

**Speaker B:** I know about the videos.

**Speaker A:** So I can— there's a, there's a YouTube channel, Dhammarato Dhamma.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I know of it. I know.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so in all of those, or let us say the more recent videos, uh, it has Sangha links in the description of the videos.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, that sounds good. Like at least 2 times a week that, you know, I can be exposed to more of this type of Dharma.

**Speaker A:** The Sangha is actually the other side of it, and that is making some, you could call it spiritual friends, or Kaliya Metta.

**Speaker B:** I have really been trying to do that myself. I'm active on a certain forum where there are a lot of seekers that go there. They're mostly Western, so that's why we call them seekers, right? But anyway, so— Well, you can join

**Speaker A:** the seekers or you could join the Satthifiers.

**Speaker B:** The Satisfier. But I met some good friends through there. And so I've definitely been wanting to have more conversations with people who are willing to talk about this stuff. I love it.

**Speaker A:** Well, invite them in. If you want, you can get them to call.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, my friend can probably join. Um, he's actually from the UK. It's kind of odd, but he can join the US and then— well, you

**Speaker A:** can join the UK because that's labeled right there in the description of all the videos, all the links. There's Twitter and there's, uh, I think there's a Facebook. I don't know about it. I mean, I've got some friends who are putting that stuff up, so it's all It's all in the description. Sweet.

**Speaker B:** Well, I think I've got my work cut out for me.

**Speaker A:** So, well, you've got some— I didn't give you any work to do. I gave you some toys to play with.

**Speaker B:** You gave me some toys to play with. Be precise with how you say things, right? Yes.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's, that's the way that I play, is I listen.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, I appreciate it a lot, Brandon.

**Speaker A:** Welcome. I'm glad to make friends with you. That's what this is all about, is friendship.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, it's, it's what I've been looking for. My My community, I used to go to Heartfulness meditation. I don't know if you've heard of that tradition. So I would go to those meditations. And then when the pandemic hit, you know, the group just split up. And then I don't know, I was really liking the in-person aspect of it, of going and being, you know, actually around people. And when it went to Zoom, I just kind of lost a lot of the zest that I had for it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it seems to be with Zoom that it always needs an additional piece of software, most likely to be emails, that nobody can do anything with Zoom alone. To work with Skype, we can do everything in Skype. Yeah, but not only do we do the calls on the Sangha US and the Sangha UK, but also people post things that they've seen, issues that they've got. It's just a community of noble friends.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So you can go and review some of the stuff that you've seen on the Skype list. When you finish Skype, you can go search for the Sangha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'll definitely do that.

**Speaker A:** Okay, Brandon, we'll see you in a few days then.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, I'll definitely keep in touch. I made it to, uh, 2 hours,

**Speaker A:** so— All righty, we'll see you.

**Speaker B:** All right, thanks.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a newcomer named Brandon (Speaker B), is a foundational introduction to a practical, stripped-down approach to the Buddha's teachings. The core message is a radical shift away from goal-oriented, complex "Western Buddhism" toward a simple, moment-to-moment practice of choosing satisfaction.

Here is a summary of the key points:

### Core Critique: Western Buddhism vs. The Buddha's Simple Teaching
*   **The Ornate Box:** Dhammarato uses the metaphor of Buddhism as an ornate, beautiful puzzle box (Buddhism as a religion/culture). The West has the box but is missing key pieces to open it and get to the real gems inside: the simple, effective teachings.
*   **The Real Gems:** The true teaching is not about **adding** anything (special states, powers, philosophical knowledge) but about **subtracting**—unloading the "crap" (unwholesome thoughts, habits, and conditioning) we've piled onto ourselves.
*   **Grandiosity & Missing Pieces:** Western Buddhism is criticized for making things grandiose (e.g., translating *dukkha* as intense "suffering" instead of "dissatisfaction"), adding concepts like elaborate rebirth theories, and creating complex, goal-driven paths (like the "Four Path" model) that turn practice into a chase.

### The Central Teaching: Choice in the Present Moment
*   **The Heart of the Practice:** The entire teaching boils down to one word: **Choice**. In any given mind-moment, you have a choice to be in a state of dissatisfaction (*dukkha*) or satisfaction (*sukkha*).
*   **Tathagata - "The One Who Goes Now":** This is the Buddha's preferred name for himself. It means to be fully in the "here and now," not lost in memories of the past or plans for the future.
*   **Life as a Waltz, Not a March:** The path is not a grueling march toward a distant goal. It's a dance or a playful activity in the present. There's "no place to go, nothing to do" when you realize satisfaction is available now.

### The Practical Method: From Dukkha to Sukkha
1.  **Recognize (Aha!):** The first skill is **Sati** (mindfulness/awareness), which is a "wake-up call." Notice when you're caught in an unwholesome thought, worry, or dissatisfaction. Dhammarato uses the Buddha's phrase: **"Aha, I see you, Mara!"** This immediately creates separation from the negative state.
2.  **Let Go & Change:** Don't just note it passively (as in some "dry" Vipassana). Actively **drop the unwholesome thought** like pulling your hand off a hot stove.
3.  **Gladden the Mind (Right Effort):** This is the crucial, often missing piece. Immediately replace the unwholesome thought with a **wholesome one**. Talk yourself into feeling good. Congratulate yourself for waking up, not chastise yourself for forgetting. Use thoughts of safety, comfort, and "everything is okay right now."
4.  **Use the Breath:** Take a conscious, long breath to anchor yourself in the present moment and "put skin in the game."
5.  **Chill Out:** The resulting state is *sukkha*—satisfaction, safety, comfort. **Nibbana (Nirvana)** is reframed simply as this chilled-out, cool, peaceful state where the "heat" of unwholesome thoughts is removed.

### Key Supporting Concepts
*   **Instincts vs. Wisdom:** We operate on old survival/nesting instincts (fear, seeking status, resentment of authority) that cause problems in a safe modern life. The practice is about choosing wisdom over these ingrained programs.
*   **Kamma (Karma) Reinterpreted:** It's not a cosmic scoreboard of good/bad deeds yielding future results. It's the **instant cause and effect** in the mind. An unwholesome thought (*akusala kamma*) instantly produces mental dissatisfaction. A wholesome thought (*kusala kamma*) instantly produces peace.
*   **Practical Advice for Meditation:**
    *   **Prioritize Comfort:** If you're physically uncomfortable, you cannot be satisfied. Don't endure painful postures.
    *   **Short & Frequent Sessions:** Instead of struggling for one long hour, do multiple short sessions (e.g., 6 x 10 minutes per day) to repeatedly taste success and satisfaction.
    *   **Meditation is "Professional Chilling":** It's the skilled practice of letting go and gladdening the mind, not a grim investigation of suffering.

### Conclusion & Invitation
The talk concludes by framing the entire endeavor as one of **friendship**—first with oneself, then with others. Brandon is invited to join the community (Sangha) calls to continue learning and practicing with "spiritual friends." The emphasis is left on practice as playing with "toys," not doing "work," and making the Dhamma an easy, joyful part of daily life.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Speaker A, likely a Buddhist teacher) uses a rich tapestry of metaphors and stories to explain the core teachings and critique common misunderstandings in Western Buddhism. Here is a breakdown of the primary ones:

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **Friendship as the Foundation:** The entire teaching is framed as "the teaching of friendship." You must first learn to be a friend to yourself before you can be a true friend to the world.

2.  **Being "Above the World":** Borrowing from the Christian idea of being "in the world but not of the world," the practice is described as learning to "float above it." This means observing life's dramas without being entangled in them.

3.  **The Hot Stove/Coal:** This is a central analogy for the immediacy of letting go. Just as you instinctively pull your hand from a hot stove or a baby draws its hand from a hot coal, you should learn to instantly "drop" unwholesome thoughts or clinging the moment you see them.

4.  **Buddhism as a **Puzzle Box with Missing Pieces** (Critique of Western Buddhism):**
    *   **The Ornate Box:** The teachings of the Buddha are like precious gems (the Three Jewels/Refuges). They are kept in an "extraordinarily ornate, beautiful box" named **"Buddhism."**
    *   **The Puzzle Box:** This box is itself a puzzle box. Western Buddhism has the box, but **some pieces of the puzzle are missing** (e.g., right effort, the immediacy of the Third Noble Truth). People admire and get satisfied by the ornate box itself, never opening it to get the prize inside.
    *   **The Prize:** The real prize is not something you *get*, but a quality of being you *uncover* by removing "crap."

5.  **Life as a Dance, Not a March:** This contrasts two ways of living:
    *   **A March:** Goal-oriented, striving, always going *somewhere*, which implies you are incomplete *here*.
    *   **A Waltz/Dance:** Playful, having fun, with "no place to go." The spiritual path is about *playing* in the present moment.

6.  **Uncovering vs. Adding (The "Garbage Pit"):** We mistakenly look for love, happiness, or gems outside ourselves. In reality, our inner world has been used as a **"garbage pit"** where we've piled societal and instinctual "crap." The path is not about *adding* anything (you get "zip, zilch, nothing"), but about a **"major dump"**—unloading and removing the garbage to uncover what's already there.

7.  **The Nesting Instinct & Society's Box:** Our human instincts (like self-preservation and the nesting/herding instinct) create a metaphorical **"box."** Society's rules and expectations are put into this box from childhood. We then live reactively from this box—resenting authority, rebelling, or seeking status—instead of choosing wisdom.

8.  **Fearlessness vs. Feeling Safe (Abhaya):** The Pali term *abhaya* is often translated as "fearlessness," which connotes a warrior facing danger. The speaker corrects this: the goal is **"feeling safe."** If you truly feel safe, there is no battle to be courageous *for*.

9.  **Meditation as Professional Chilling:** Nibbana (Nirvana) is stripped of its grandiose, magical connotations. It is simply **"chilling out"**—cooling the "hot thoughts," relaxing, and knowing everything is okay. Meditation is thus **"learning how to chill out professionally."**

10. **The Cup of Coffee:** To illustrate that the end of suffering (Third Noble Truth) is not a distant goal, he uses the analogy of a cup of coffee. If you want a sip, you just take it. It's immediately available, not a future achievement. Having it as a "goal" keeps you in a state of dissatisfaction.

11. **The Door and the Key:** The Noble Eightfold Path is not a long road to a faraway door. **The door is right in front of you.** The Path is the simple procedure (like using a key) to open it *right now*. The problem is thinking the door is 100 miles away.

12. **"Aha, I See You, Mara":** This famous phrase is presented as the essential skill. When an unwholesome thought (Mara) arises, you don't fight it. You simply recognize it: **"Aha, I see you."** This act of recognition itself creates separation and freedom, pulling you "above the world."

13. **The Stock Market & The Penalty Flag:** These stories critique simplistic, results-oriented views of **Karma (Kamma)**. Buying a stock (greed) is only called "good" or "bad" *after* we see the result. A referee's penalty is "good" for one team and "bad" for the other. True Karma is moment-to-moment cause and effect, free from hope and fear about future results.

14. **Writer's Block vs. Playing with a Toy:** Applied to writing and life. You can see a task (like writing) as a burdensome job to perfect, leading to block, or as **a toy to play with**—an activity to enjoy in the moment.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

*   **The Zen Master and the Monk:** A young monk asks if the master is meditating to become enlightened. The master replies, **"No, I'm just sitting here because I'm already enlightened."** This illustrates the non-goal-oriented nature of true practice (like Zazen, which is "good for nothing").
*   **The Student and the Car Crash:** A student felt proud for waking up in time to swerve and avoid a crash. The teacher pointed out that if he had been paying attention all along, there would have been **no emergency to react to.** This underscores moment-to-moment awareness.
*   **Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places:** Referencing the old country song, the speaker says society teaches us to look for fulfillment (love) in external society, which is the "wrong place." The right place is inside, once it's cleaned out.
*   **The 20-Minute Attention Span & Incense:** To counter the idea of needing to meditate for painful hour-long sessions, the speaker notes the human attention span is about **20 minutes**—coincidentally the length of a standard incense stick. He recommends short, frequent "chilling" sessions instead.

### **Summary of Contrasts (Metaphorical Framing)**
The talk consistently sets up contrasts using these metaphors:

*   **Western Buddhism vs. The Buddha's Core Teaching:** Ornate puzzle box with missing pieces **vs.** simple, immediate gems.
*   **The Seeker's Path vs. The Satisfier's Path:** A long march toward a goal **vs.** a joyful dance here and now.
*   **Adding vs. Uncovering:** Trying to get something special **vs.** removing garbage to reveal what's there.
*   **Striving vs. Chilling:** Hard effort and suffering in meditation **vs.** professional chilling and feeling safe.
*   **Goal vs. Immediate Availability:** Enlightenment as a future achievement **vs.** satisfaction as available as a cup of coffee right now.

These metaphors collectively aim to demystify Buddhist practice, frame it as a practical, accessible, and joyful process of inner cleaning and present-moment choice, and sharply critique the goal-oriented, striving, and often pessimistic approach the speaker sees in modern Western interpretations.
