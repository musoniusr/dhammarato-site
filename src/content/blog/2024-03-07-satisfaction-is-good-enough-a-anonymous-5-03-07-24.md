### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Sorry, you cut out for a second.

**Speaker B:** You see my Anagami now?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, all right. So that's what we're practicing. We're practicing this: whatever it is right now is good enough. And you're practicing correctly up to the point that, yeah, you've got satisfaction, but it's not enough. It's not good enough. Yeah, okay. So that's the thought that comes after, and that thought now has become unwholesome. See how quickly and easily unwholesome thoughts come in? And so we have to be on guard for, oh, that's just another wholesome— unwholesome thought. Aha, I see you, Mara. Let me go back and become satisfied again. It's a very subtle point that people begin to practice, they get good results, but they're wanting more. And partly because you have been lied to. Your society, and especially your religions, and all of those Dharma teachers have been lying to you. And maybe not directly, maybe they're indirectly lying in the sense that they're repeating stuff that they heard that were lies without recognizing that they were lies. An example of that is, what is enlightenment? Oh, it's way up there someplace, and I don't have it yet. But the reality is that yes, you do. You're just not satisfied with it because you think it's way up there. You've been lied to. It's not way up there. Here it is. There's nothing more. Can you be satisfied with nothing more? There's nothing much to it.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that makes sense.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I think it makes perfect sense, doesn't it? Once you begin to see the sense of it, that you've been lied to, that in fact you're lying to yourself, you've got your own delusions about whatever I've got now could be better. And so you're practicing in that point disappointment. And what we're practicing here is being satisfied, not being disappointed. Because if you practice being disappointed in the sense of, yeah, this is satisfying, but it's not enough satisfaction, I want the really good stuff, then you'll go the rest of your life practicing, oh, this is not good enough, I want the really good stuff. So let's practice correctly. Let's practice. This is the good stuff. This is all there is. Wow, I can really dig this. This is enlightenment. This is good enough. And your satisfaction will grow. Just like somebody practicing a musical instrument and keeps practicing and keeps practicing will get better at it. But if they buy a piano and buy a bunch of books and take lessons from the teacher, and then they spend all their time practicing using a hammer on the piano.

**Speaker A:** They won't work.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because that's what you're doing is instead of practicing the piano, you're taking a— you're beating it, you're taking a hammer to it. Oh, this is not good enough. So instead of practicing, this is not good enough, I want more, start to practice, this is good enough, this is all I need. Pretty soon that will start to grow as a skill. So that no matter what comes by, it's good enough. And?

**Speaker A:** And, okay, that makes sense. Yeah, I'll keep that. I think the issue was I was clinging on to this feeling of wanting things to be better and that pleasant sensations. But I just need to focus on or just need to remind myself that be satisfied in the moment because I am satisfied.

**Speaker B:** Because it is satisfactory.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** We experience reality through our senses. We experience reality through our body. Can we experience reality also with the mind? Can we experience reality with our feelings? Can we experience reality with our attitude?

**Speaker A:** What do you mean by that?

**Speaker B:** Like experiencing— Well, you're experiencing reality, but your attitude is this is not good enough. Good. So change your attitude into this is reality and it is good enough.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Is it good enough?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Is reality good enough? Because that's all you're ever going to get is reality. That plus stuff you make up that makes you dissatisfied with reality. When you stay with reality, then everything's okay. Go ahead, I'm listening.

**Speaker A:** So is that all there is to the practice, just being satisfied with reality and what we have?

**Speaker B:** Yes, and when you change your attitude about reality, then it gets better and better because it's your attitude that's getting better and better about reality. Until you get that hot diggity dog, this is real. Wow, I've got reality! Isn't that amazing? And that is a change of your attitude.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I think that makes a lot of sense.

**Speaker B:** So start to change your attitude about this is it, this is good enough. Wow, this is fine. I can dig this. This is enough. Everything is all right. Everything is okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I'll do that.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, you go practice some more and then call me again, but you practice correctly. Practice being satisfied. This is good enough. Okay, let that satisfaction grow. Right now your satisfaction is just a seed. It's going to become a tree. But if you keep taking a hammer to that seed because it ain't good enough, it's not a tree yet, and all you've got is the mashed seed, and that's all you'll ever have is a mashed seed. Right.

**Speaker A:** Thank you.

**Speaker B:** So nurture it. Nurture yourself. Nurture it. Let it grow. This is good enough, and your satisfaction with reality will start to grow.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I'll go do that.

**Speaker B:** All right, excellent. We'll see you later then.

**Speaker A:** Thank you so much again.

**Speaker B:** All right, bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on the dialogue, here is a summary of the core Dhamma teaching from Dhammarato (Speaker B):

**Central Teaching: The Trap of "Not Good Enough" and the Path of Satisfaction**

The talk focuses on a subtle but critical error in meditation and spiritual practice: the mindset that one's present experience, however peaceful, is "not enough" and that enlightenment or true happiness is somewhere else in the future.

**Key Points:**

1.  **The Primary Error:** When a meditator gets a good result (calm, satisfaction) but then thinks, "This is good, but I want *more*," that very thought becomes unwholesome. It's a form of craving and disappointment that undermines the present peace.

2.  **The Root Cause: A Cultural Lie:** We are conditioned by society and even some spiritual teachings to believe that enlightenment is a distant, monumental achievement. This creates a delusion that what we have *now* can't be "it." We lie to ourselves that our current peace could always be better.

3.  **The Correct Practice:** The antidote is to actively practice **satisfaction** with the present reality. The instruction is: "This is good enough. This is all there is. This *is* enlightenment." The goal is to change one's **attitude** toward the present moment from one of lack to one of contentment.

4.  **The Analogy:** Practicing while wanting "more" is like trying to learn piano by hitting it with a hammer. You destroy the seed of satisfaction. Instead, you must nurture that seed by repeatedly affirming "this is good enough," allowing it to grow naturally into a strong, abiding peace.

5.  **The Result:** By changing your attitude to one of acceptance and satisfaction with reality *as it is experienced*, your satisfaction deepens. Reality itself doesn't change, but your relationship to it does, leading to greater and greater happiness. "Everything is all right" becomes a lived experience.

**In a Nutshell:** The path is not about acquiring a better experience in the future, but about dropping the attitude of dissatisfaction with the experience you are having right now. True practice is the cultivation of contentment with "what is."

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, the speaker uses several key metaphors and stories to illustrate the core teaching of **being satisfied with the present moment as "good enough."**

Here are the main metaphors and stories identified:

**1. The "Mara" Metaphor**
*   **Quote:** *"Aha, I see you, Mara."*
*   **Meaning:** "Mara" is a personification of temptation, distraction, and unwholesome states in Buddhist teaching. The speaker uses it as a metaphor for the insidious thought that "this isn't enough," framing dissatisfaction as a deceptive trickster to be recognized and dismissed.

**2. The "Enlightenment is Way Up There" Story**
*   **Quote:** *"An example of that is, what is enlightenment? Oh, it's way up there someplace, and I don't have it yet. But the reality is that yes, you do."*
*   **Meaning:** This is a story about a pervasive cultural and religious lie. The speaker argues that people are taught a story that enlightenment is a distant, future achievement, which itself creates dissatisfaction with the present. The counter-story is: **enlightenment is here, now, in the satisfaction with "what is."**

**3. The Musical Instrument / Hammer Metaphor**
*   **Quote:** *"But if they buy a piano... and then they spend all their time practicing using a hammer on the piano."*
*   **Meaning:** This is an extended analogy.
    *   **Correct Practice** = Playing the piano (practicing satisfaction).
    *   **Incorrect Practice** = Using a hammer on the piano (practicing dissatisfaction by thinking "this isn't good enough").
    *   The metaphor powerfully shows that the *method* of practice (satisfaction vs. dissatisfaction) determines the result. Practicing dissatisfaction destroys the very instrument of your peace.

**4. The Seed and Tree Metaphor**
*   **Quote:** *"Right now your satisfaction is just a seed. It's going to become a tree. But if you keep taking a hammer to that seed because it ain't good enough... all you'll ever have is a mashed seed."*
*   **Meaning:** This builds on the hammer metaphor. The initial feeling of satisfaction is fragile, like a seed. Nurturing it (by repeatedly choosing the attitude "this is good enough") allows it to grow into a strong, stable state (a tree). Attacking it with the "hammer" of dissatisfaction destroys its potential completely.

**5. The "Hot Diggity Dog" Attitude Shift**
*   **Quote:** *"Until you get that hot diggity dog, this is real. Wow, I've got reality!"*
*   **Meaning:** This is a vivid, colloquial story of a transformed perspective. It moves from a grudging "okay, fine" to an enthusiastic, celebratory embrace of reality as it is. The metaphor is one of **discovery and delight**, rather than resignation.

**Underlying Conceptual Metaphors:**
*   **Satisfaction is a Skill:** It is compared to practicing an instrument—something that grows with correct, repeated effort.
*   **Dissatisfaction is Violence:** It is framed as "taking a hammer" to your peace or your potential.
*   **Reality is the Only Material/Experience:** The speaker repeatedly states, "That's all you're ever going to get is reality." The added suffering is the "stuff you make up" about it. This frames reality as the fundamental ground of experience.
*   **The Mind is a Gardener:** One must "nurture" the seed of satisfaction and "let it grow," implying the mind has agency in tending to its own states.

In summary, the speaker uses these metaphors and stories to combat the narrative of **"more, better, later"** and replace it with the practice of **"enough, here, now."** The tools (hammer, piano) and growth (seed, tree) metaphors make the abstract process of cultivating contentment very concrete and actionable.
