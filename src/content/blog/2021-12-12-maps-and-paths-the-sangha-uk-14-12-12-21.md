### Transcript


**Speaker A:** that I was, and I was like, oh yeah, man, I've definitely had that at least a few times, this, these experiences that could be called what he mentions as arising and passing away, and then the necessary, or as he tells it, necessary slip into a dark night territory afterwards. And when I read that, I was like, yeah, man, that's pretty much what I've been dealing with these past years in various intensities.

**Speaker B:** Comforting to read that stuff, hey?

**Speaker A:** Yes, it is. But also that I had kind of had the feeling that I may have made a few quote-unquote mistakes at some point because I So I got to experience it all over again. Because just right off the top of my head, during the last 2 and a half years, I've had, I think, at least 2 arising and passing away experiences. One, what was like really one of the The big tipping points for me, that intense Kundalini awakening experience, and one where I was, that was in the beginning of this year, I did some like channeling and healing work with someone, and after that, that was already quite intense, and after that I had the same evening, I had an experience of becoming loving awareness for a while. Like coming home and that night or a night later I had one of the most strange lucid dreams of my life, like being so hyper-lucid and meeting a woman telling me that she was a fabrication of my imagination.

**Speaker B:** She knew what was up.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, man. But yeah, as you said, it was rather comforting to read Yeah, that was quite something. And today when I took a walk, I had a moment where I was just, just for a few seconds there, I was home in a way, like suddenly a bit like being a kid again.

**Speaker B:** Delightful.

**Speaker A:** Yes,

**Speaker B:** delightful. And I see a trend here, Doug. I see these experiences happening more and more often for you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, apparently that's where it's going, and it has happened often enough now that I think I'm starting to develop a bit of trust that that's the overall direction in which I'm headed. Good, good, good.

**Speaker C:** Hey Dan, your sound is like really bad, but it might just be the device that you're on. I don't know.

**Speaker B:** Let's see what I can do.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so it wasn't just my output, so it is on the input.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah. I mean, Ingram has like an awesome way of making it like, uh, for me, feel, feel like you're not alone. That's the one thing that I really like about it is sometimes, uh, the spiritual path can seem really lonely, but the way that he writes about it, it's like it's so easy to identify, uh, different, yeah, stages or, you know, any, anything like just his, his writing style just has such a clear way of being like, oh, I see, I see exactly what, like, what he's describing here. I know that I was in this phase that he's describing, you know. And I mean, there's definitely like negatives to him too, because like, I mean, I tend to think that he can be like a little bit harsh in his writing style, but then when I've listened to him talk, he's not really like that at all, you know. He's quite loving and kind. And there just was a, like, kind of a talk with him and Dhammarato recently, and I was just struck by like how different his persona is when he's not writing. That is very loving and very compassionate and caring. And sometimes I think his writing can be a little bit harsh, kind of like boot camp style Buddhism, you know. But, you know, we all need that sometimes too. Sometimes we need a kick in the ass to be like 'Hey, practice for real.' But other times, you know, balance there.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, I've actually— I haven't really made up my mind on his way of speaking and stuff because I've heard like one or two interviews with Guru Viking, with him, and one thing that really bugged me out was— or bummed me out a bit was that it kind of sounds that he is talking like really nasally a lot of the time, and I wasn't sure if he was just having a cold or if that's his standard style, and that was kind of weird.

**Speaker B:** Well, we all have our individual styles. I don't know, am I sounding any better right now?

**Speaker C:** No, it still sounds pretty terrible.

**Speaker B:** That's not good.

**Speaker C:** It just sounds like it's like an echo or something. I don't know. Hmm. Because it sounds bad for you too, Parker, right? I can't hear Parker at all even though he's talking. Can anybody else hear?

**Speaker B:** How's this?

**Speaker C:** No good. No.

**Speaker A:** Did you— Dan, did you use your— Can you hear me now?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, we can hear you.

**Speaker A:** You sound fine to me, Dan.

**Speaker C:** Oh,

**Speaker B:** that's weird.

**Speaker A:** Can you guys make out what he's saying?

**Speaker C:** I mean, yeah, I want to make

**Speaker A:** sure we're hearing the same thing.

**Speaker C:** I don't know, it's just, it's just echoing a little bit and it's quite quiet. But yeah, I mean, I can definitely hear what you're saying. I mean, it just might be how it is. We might just have to— that just might be our reality.

**Speaker A:** Hey Brandon, it's good to see you again. What's up?

**Speaker B:** I'm gonna leave and rejoin. Hey guys, see you guys. I'm told that there are some issues with my microphone, so I'm going to leave the call and rejoin. We'll see how that goes.


### Summary

Based on the provided transcript, here is a summary of the Dhamma talk:

The conversation centers on personal meditation experiences and the teachings of Daniel Ingram (author of *Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha*).

**Key Themes:**

1.  **Validating Difficult Experiences:** Speaker A shares relief in reading Ingram's maps, specifically identifying their intense "arising and passing away" experiences and subsequent difficult periods ("dark night" territory) as recognized stages on the path, not personal failures. This normalization is described as "comforting."

2.  **Personal Anecdotes:** Speaker A recounts specific powerful experiences, including a "Kundalini awakening," a moment of "becoming loving awareness," and a hyper-lucid dream. They note these positive, "homecoming" type experiences are happening more frequently, building trust in their practice's direction.

3.  **Discussion of Daniel Ingram's Style:** The group discusses the perceived difference between Ingram's written persona ("harsh," "boot camp style Buddhism") and his spoken demeanor in talks (described as "loving," "compassionate," and "caring"). They acknowledge his writing can be a necessary "kick in the ass" but appreciate the more balanced, kind tone of his verbal teachings.

4.  **Community and Shared Path:** A key point is how Ingram's work makes the spiritual path feel less lonely. His detailed descriptions allow practitioners to clearly identify their own experiences within a shared framework, fostering a sense of community and understanding.

**Notable Absence:** While the talk is framed as being "with Dhammarato," the teacher **Dhammarato does not speak in this excerpt**. The discussion is primarily among Sangha friends comparing notes and discussing another teacher's (Ingram's) work.

**Technical Issues:** A significant portion of the transcript is interrupted by attempts to troubleshoot Speaker B's (likely "Dan") audio quality, which is echoing and quiet. This breaks the flow of the Dhamma discussion.

**In essence:** This segment of the talk is a peer-support sharing session where practitioners find solace and clarity by mapping their intense, sometimes confusing, meditation-related experiences onto a modern pragmatic Dharma framework, while also reflecting on the tone and delivery of the teachings themselves.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the provided transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors and stories** related to the spiritual path, particularly drawing from Buddhist and meditation terminology. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Metaphors:**
1. **"Arising and passing away"** – A core metaphor from Buddhist meditation (often called the "A&P" in Theravada/insight meditation circles). It describes a stage where meditators experience intense, often blissful, insights and phenomena that eventually dissolve, leading to deeper (and sometimes difficult) stages of practice.
2. **"Dark night" territory** – A metaphor borrowed from Christian mysticism (St. John of the Cross) but adopted in modern meditation discourse (especially by Daniel Ingram, whom they reference) to describe a period of struggle, doubt, or emotional difficulty that can follow peak spiritual experiences.
3. **"Tipping point"** – A metaphor for a moment of critical change or transformation, used here to describe a major Kundalini awakening.
4. **"Coming home" / "I was home"** – A metaphor for moments of profound peace, familiarity, or non-dual awareness, where one feels aligned with their true nature.
5. **"Boot camp style Buddhism"** – A metaphor used by Speaker C to describe Daniel Ingram’s direct, no-nonsense, and sometimes harsh approach to teaching meditation.

### **Stories/Narratives:**
1. **Personal "A&P and Dark Night" cycle** – Speaker A shares his own story of having had multiple "arising and passing away" experiences, followed by necessary dips into "dark night" periods over the past few years. This frames his spiritual journey as a non-linear path with peaks and valleys.
2. **Kundalini awakening story** – Speaker A briefly recounts a major "tipping point" experience involving intense Kundalini energy, which is a story of sudden spiritual awakening and energy transformation.
3. **Channeling/healing work story** – Speaker A tells of doing channeling and healing work, after which he experienced "becoming loving awareness" and then had an extremely vivid lucid dream where a figure told him she was a "fabrication of my imagination." This story explores themes of reality, illusion, and self-awareness.
4. **Childlike moment on a walk** – A small, spontaneous story of briefly feeling "like a kid again" during a walk, representing a momentary return to innocence, presence, or ease.
5. **Daniel Ingram’s persona contrast** – Speaker C shares an observation about the difference between Ingram’s harsh, direct writing style ("boot camp") and his more compassionate, loving demeanor in person or in talks. This is a mini-story about perception and the difference between someone's crafted persona and their lived presence.

The conversation itself is **framed as a shared story**—a group of practitioners comparing their experiences to a map (Ingram’s model) and finding comfort in the commonality, thus countering the loneliness of the spiritual path. The technical difficulties with the microphone (Dan leaving and rejoining) also become a minor, meta-story of interruption and reconnection within the dialogue.
