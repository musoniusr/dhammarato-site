### Transcript


**Speaker A:** And if not, oh well. So be it.

**Speaker B:** So be it. You and I chewing the fat.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, totally. Yeah, so has your practice been okay lately?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, not bad. I sort of, my meditation's a little bit, you know, I'm not as consistent as I'd like to be with it. It's probably sort of most days I do meditate, but yeah, I don't know. I've found since pretty much since COVID my practice isn't as— I don't know, something happened. My practice hasn't been as good or whatever you want to say. I don't know. I don't know.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the classical type of sitting or walking meditation is wonderful, but I found it really— when you remember that, it's almost like a remembering to let go, you know? It's so subtle and it's so slippery almost, you know? It's like we'll get caught up in the drama of life.

**Speaker C:** And it really.

**Speaker A:** Is a miraculous thing when you figure out the doorway of, wait a minute, yeah, I can let this go. Yeah, it literally is like the Buddha described, like holding anger or whatever is holding like a hot stone. It's just burning yourself. It doesn't mean that you have to be a doormat. You can still do things logically and reasonably and even honorably in some cases. Yeah, but there's no reason to suffer because of— no reason to have, uh, really dissatisfaction.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you're right. Yeah, I tend to find, like, I work at home sort of half the time, and I find that a bit difficult. I find that a bit stressful having that sort of— I don't know, it's maybe it's just, it's much easier being able to go into the office. But my circumstances mean that I can't all the time, um, just with kids and stuff. So yeah, I sort of, I find it a bit stressful, sort of, I don't know, just having that disconnect between myself and the people there. And sometimes I get a bit sort of like I don't sleep too well, and then I get short with people on the calls, and I don't know, I just Yeah, but you're right. I mean, it's not so bad because, like you say, I can just sort of stop and every now and again stop and go, hang on, this is just— chill out, like, relax, you know. It's not, it's not that big a drama. All this stuff that you're getting chirpy about, none of it really matters in a sense, you know. So yeah, I'm able to kind of let it go, so that's not too bad.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's all just Anicca, Dukkha, and Arhat. All just impermanent, dissatisfactory, and empty inherently by nature. Nothing holding on to whatsoever.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And we learn that, you know, and that's wisdom, is seeing that that's not worth holding on to, whatever it may be. It's all Anicca, Dukkha, and Arhat. Even the holding on to the Dharma practice the wrong way, you know, clinging to the things, clinging to being right, clinging to beliefs. I said this in another video, ironically clinging entirely to the Dhamma is letting it go, is just breathing and relaxing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you know.

**Speaker A:** That's in a weird way, it's like if you— those who cling to the Dhamma the strongest with the wholesome clinging are the ones who let it go, are the ones who just said, yeah, they're just words in my head, you know. These websites, labels, these polycams, these— this, see that? What is this? What are we doing playing?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's true. I remember when I first discovered Buddhism, I came to it through Tibetan Buddhism, which is a lovely practice. You know, they've got some— yeah, it's really nice, and I met some really great people. But I had a couple of experiences where, like, one time we had food after we— and I accidentally started eating before the teacher, and this lady, yeah, like, really yelled at me. And I was like, wow. And the silly thing is the teacher thought it was hilarious. He was just laughing about it. Like, he didn't care. Just this old Tibetan guy, you know, he was like, yeah, he thought it was funny. And someone else told me their wife, he was an Australian guy, and his wife brought, he brought his wife with him, and she obviously didn't know anything about etiquette, and she put a book on the floor. And like he said, someone yelled at her for putting a book on the floor, and you're just like, come on, like Yeah, it's like stuff like that, like you talk about. It's just being attached to Dharma or being attached to, oh, you've got to do things this way or otherwise it's— I don't know, I just saw a few things that, that where people were obviously really attached to these things, and it kind of put me off a bit. I was like, are these people— it's more about the rituals than it is about actually practicing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, totally. Yeah, it can, you know, our human bad habits and nature, they want to be right and they're insecure. They're not sure if they're right. So we're looking for validation from others constantly by forcing them to feel the way we want them.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Believing in the things we believe in.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** It'S an interesting thing talking about Dhamma practice because there's so many weeks where before I do these calls or talk with other people on other calls, I'm like, I wasn't even thinking about anything really before. It's like, but as it gets closer to the call, I can see my mind like starting to spin and like, why am I even concerned with anything to do with this?

**Speaker B:** I was fine.

**Speaker A:** Before doing this, you know. And I really just, I find a nice comfortable home in silence, you know. And that's where a lot of the old Zen masters used to do that as well, when they were sweeping or when they were cleaning or when they were working or doing whatever. There is something beautiful there, you know. And that to me, that's the true Dhamma, is the the, as Robert Adams put it, the silence of the heart. Not just silence of words, but silence of all things, you know. Yeah, the competition ends when there's silence. And the universe doesn't need our opinions, it doesn't need our beliefs, it doesn't need us to figure things out or to really do anything. I don't know if Dhammarato put it this way. Somebody was like, you know, I like to say everything's automatic, you know. Aside— I was thinking about this today— aside from maybe like if you're hitting yourself with a hammer, you got to set it down. But after you set it down, you see that everything's automatic. We're so used to smacking ourselves in.

**Speaker B:** The head, you know. It's true, it's true. I tend to— I'm pretty addicted to my devices, you know, and I catch myself just constantly, some days, not always, but, you know, happen to have some kind of noise in the background or something, and I'm just like, oh man, I just need some quiet for a while. Just, what are you doing? Like, turn it off, go for a walk, just— and you feel so much better in silence for a while, you know. It's just just like, ah, calm. You can really calm down and get quiet.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, nature really helps reveal, um, the truth because all the politics goes away and all the, all the bullshit of life goes away. Um, but you know, there is something to be said with still being in the world, you know. Still, uh, you know, being on a mountain would be great and ideal for everybody, away from society and stuff, but that's not always what we see ourselves in. You know, that's not always the way things are. Actually, it can kind of be a blessing because we're practicing in things that a lot of people, a lot of monks ironically, aren't really going to experience. You know, for instance, if you don't have children, really, what is there to be afraid of? What fear is there? Dying even is like— if you have children, if you have family, you know, these things, it's a— you have a bit more in the game, so to speak. So it, uh, if you can be relaxed amongst those things, amongst society, amongst working, all these things, um, oddly enough, it's almost better for your practice. Yeah, like UG Krishnamurti said, if it doesn't work in traffic, what's the point? Anybody can go on a mission and be peaceful. Yeah, give all my responsibilities away, give everything away. Yeah, I'll be peaceful too.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's true. That's really where, that's really where your practice comes out, right, is in situations like that where, you know, things are thrown at you and you're like, well, how are you going to deal with this? Today, you know, like, yeah, it's true. And I stay at a monastery a fair bit, so you kind of do see the way people behave. And I mean, it's just another community. It's just like a bunch of people getting thrown together who have to— so in some, in some ways, I don't know, like, I live by myself. My kids come and stay with me 50% of the time. I've got my kids with me, otherwise I'm alone. But In a monastery, yeah, you've kind of got different personalities and you still have to get on with these people to some degree, you know. So I suppose there's still that, unless you, like you say, you're living alone on a mountain or something, you're still sort of living with other people and dealing with other personalities. So I probably had a bit of a romantic idea of, you know, going to a monastery and it's all going to be all this peaceful and Never. But they work 7 days a week and they have to live with each other.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, yeah, there's certain wats I think where they're like, a lot of monks spend a lot of times in isolation. You're saying the Tibetan tradition, and those yogis aren't even so-called monks, you know, they're just practitioners who are really devout practitioners.

**Speaker B:** Arahant.

**Speaker A:** Um, it's not uncommon for them to go away for 7, 10 years in a cave. Um, and that's, uh, that always seems so wonderful.

**Speaker D:** You like the idea?

**Speaker A:** I'm not— I'm sure it's not like easy, you know. I'm sure like pretty fucking hard, but at the same time, uh The, the, uh, the other side of the coin is like, wow, that would be so cool.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's kind of a nice idea, isn't it? But yeah, I don't know. I don't know if I could do it. I like people too much. I think I do like people's company. So.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I, uh, I try to sometimes view my life my day-to-day things as just like, it's no different than being in some type of isolation. Yeah, I'll see people, I'll interact, but even on my day-to-day, it's not very much. But as doing my daily things, it's just like you were saying, it's no different than washing the dishes in a monastery or a wat or whatever, doing the dishes or cleaning your bowl in a monastery or whatever, pot, whatever you want to call it, and cleaning things in your house, you know, as a householder. Um, they're all just labels. They're all just labels that don't really do us any, uh, any good, really.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, to go back and look at.

**Speaker A:** It.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I used to battle a bit with, you know, ah, the environment I'm in and difficult. And, uh, but yeah, I don't know, when you stop and think about it, yeah, there's not much difference really. Yeah, and I think it gets a bit easier. Do you have kids? You have children? Yeah, yeah, cool. So yeah, my kids are getting a bit older now, and it's sort of, in a lot of ways, they become independent, you know, so they don't need— they sort of don't need that constant attention like they do when they're young. So, oh good, mate. Yeah, it makes it a bit easier. You sort of got a bit more time to practice and not be, you know, constantly interrupted with things and having to do so much. Yeah, makes it a bit easier.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah, sometimes I think about other people in society struggling with mental health or certain conditions like that. And part of me really wishes that the Dharma practice was more familiar in our culture, you know, because I think it would really be beneficial for a lot of people. But we do what we can, you know. We do these videos and talks and, uh, yeah, friends within the Sanghas and stuff like that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But everything comes in waves.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I don't know about you, but when I first discovered Dharma, you know, I was kind of excited and I gave books to— I talked to my family about it and my friends and I gave a couple of people books and, oh, you got to read this, you got to— and then after a while you realize they're not interested. It's like, what am I doing? Like, and so I just stopped. And now I just don't, because I've had— and every now and again someone will come up with a question like, how can I get my family to— but I'm like, you can try. Like, just be an example is probably the best thing you can do, right? Just show them that, hey, this is pretty cool. I'm happy You know, I meditate, it's good for me.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, even within the Sangha, look, one person shows up.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's true.

**Speaker A:** We take time out of our day and don't charge money, and everybody's all about friendship until it's time for the— then it's like, oh, where's all those pretty words then? Yeah, but humans by nature are full of shit, you know. So, and that's a good lesson too, because you could bang your head against the wall your entire existence. Why can't conditions and people and things be a certain way that I want them to be? I, me, my, you know. And the truth of the matter is You can't be surprised. People are people. It's just the way it is. As the bird flies, the humans are nice one moment, distant the next.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Bored one moment, happy the next, angry the next. You know, birth and death over and over.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** And.

**Speaker A:** When you're earnestly practicing the Dharma, you see the mind for what it is. You see that the mind is just this manipulative, half good, half bad, always throwing out randomized suggestions. And when we cling on to those suggestions, then it releases the valves of the chemicals, the emotions in our mind, and then they come up. And like dye in a fishbowl, you know, blue dye in a fishbowl, you can imagine let's say the fishbowl has a filter, it's cleaning the water, but it still takes a moment to get that dye out of there. And the Dhamma practice is preventing those chemicals from even entering the water in the first place, those things that trigger us. But you'll never fully stop the dye from getting in there. Once the dye gets in there, it's like, okay, The wisdom is there's nothing I can do with this. You know, I can't clean it any faster. The anger is there, especially if you act out on it. We've acted out on it. Okay, now we just have to deal with our Kamma, our consequences of acting out on silly things we knew we shouldn't have acted out on.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that's ironic in a way. Kamma is the consequence of our actions. But you can put it in another way. It's like the biological consequences of our actions, because we still have those thoughts, feelings, and emotions. One could say even strong, more strong when we act out on them instead of just feeling them and letting them pass.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that's why living a simple, peaceful life, it kills all negative Kamma. You know, because there's nothing that you stir up. The water always remains still and cool and peaceful and empty. You don't have to worry about it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Today I was walking in the graveyard, as I like to do. And it's so funny, it's like you really see the end of the joke of life when you're walking through a graveyard, you know. So you see all the different ages, some were 20, some were 40, some were old, some were young. And you're just like, man, it's all a game, isn't it? It's all just a play of Lila. We're just going to end up in the ground, you know, with a little stone over us. Depicting some type of time passage.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, interesting. So you— yeah, it is a good, good, um, good practice, I guess. Yeah, to kind of reflect on what ages people passed away and looking at the gravestones. Um, yeah. I heard, um, in— I heard a monk talk. He lived in India and he was saying that only because India is full of people, as you know, the only— he said the only place I know I'm going to get peace is if I go and sit in the cemetery. Because Indians are scared of, you know, they're scared of spirits and ghosts and stuff, so they won't— they avoid the cemetery like the plague. And he said the only place, because otherwise wherever I go people come up and want to talk to me all the time, like I never get any peace.

**Speaker A:** India.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you can imagine how many people per square foot. Yeah, yeah, you can imagine. So yeah, I thought— and I think it's the same in Thailand. I know Thai people, they're really scared of ghosts. I was talking to— I was talking to this Thai lady a few years ago, and she was saying her husband had— she'd been married and her husband had passed away, and he died in the house that she lived in. So she wouldn't— she refused to sleep in the house. So she lived next door to her sister, and she'd go and sleep. So she'd spend the day at home, but then at night she'd go and sleep in her sister's house because she was scared of his ghost coming. And it's like, Jesus, that's pretty crazy. Yeah, I thought that was pretty bizarre. Like, imagine being so— not even being able to sleep in your house because someone had passed away in there. It's pretty.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, in America it's not too different. I mean, people say that they're more scientifically minded, but there's still lots of people who want to steer clear of graveyards in America. So it's like, sometimes I go there to find kind of a peace, you know. And chances are, if you do see another person strolling through there, they're just They're just as peaceful as you because they're trying to get away. Hi Patrick, how's it going, dude?

**Speaker D:** Hello, well, it's quite good. How about you?

**Speaker A:** Good, pretty good, man.

**Speaker D:** Just fed the offspring and their friends and now it's time to chill.

**Speaker A:** Very nice. That's cool. Did you have anything on your mind, Patrick, you wanted to talk about or thought about this past week, particularly Dhamma?

**Speaker D:** Not really, really. I just like to hang out. But.

**Speaker A:** Uh, that's cool, man.

**Speaker D:** The only thing I'm a little bit curious is, is a little bit, Jhanas in Dhammarato's teaching, they usually say First jhanas enough?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, jhanas I always described as like, I don't know what Dhammarato thinks. The jhanas, I think he, from what I got from him is that they're there's something that exists and it's not necessarily all that important, you know, because it's like, um, but I don't know, I don't want to put any words in his mouth. You have to go ask him. But as far as I stand, it's just, you know, when you're reading about the Jhanas, it's like joy, equanimity, doesn't even make any sense. It's like, it's like going to, um, going to a carnival or something, or riding on some roller coasters, and then you have a chart like, what level of fun did I have? Was I at level 10 fun? Was I at level 3 joy? It makes no fucking sense. It's like, these things are just fruits of what happens when you're satisfied, you know? Call them by any name you want. But yeah, like the Buddha said, you know, if we remain detached to anything, it's just going to cause more Dukkha. Things don't last. So people will be like, oh, am I on the first Jhana? Am I on the second Jhana? And then you want to hold on to it. And then before you know it, you're causing yourself a whole bunch of dissatisfaction. Even if somebody came up to you and said, you're in the perfect enlightened Jhana, and there's equanimity and joy and then a feeling of consciousness floating here and there. Then you're like, wow, and then you're going to want to hang on to it, you know. But the thing is, no matter what we can describe from an outcome of practice, it's going to be just that. It's going to be a passing description, fading thing, an illusory thing that doesn't last, you know. So it's more important to enjoy the roller coaster than labeling and marking and noting how much fun and joy you're having from these things. You know, it's in a way, it's not particularly all that important from my perspective. I'm sure a lot of people.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think, I think the ironic thing about it is the less, the less you want to get, get into Jhana or get these experiences, the less you want it, the more likely you're going to get it, if you know what I mean. Like, if you kind of attach, I've got to get this kind of experience in meditation, then that's not going to come because you're kind of clinging to it. Whereas if you just let go, then maybe you Maybe it'll happen, maybe it won't, who knows.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, ironically you'll be in the best Jhana when you stop giving a shit about reaching Jhanas. I mean, as far as scholarly-ness, it's important. Like, if you want to read the Pali Canon and learn all those words, that could be beneficial. There's nothing wrong with that. But yeah, I'm no Pali expert or scholar expert with that stuff. But there's a plethora of them around. I'm sure they can get all detailed with you on that stuff. But at the end of the day, even when you're an expert on this stuff, it doesn't do anything. That's the point. You know, our entire Western outlook on education is more knowledge. Even, you know, our systems of government and our economic systems, you know. 3% growth, 4% growth, more, more, more. You know, I did this when people traveled, even when they do fun things like going on vacation. Oh, we went to Paris, we went to here, we got to go this next year. It's like, isn't it enough? Like, how many places do you have to go? You know, how many, uh, how much money do you need to make? How enlightened do you need to be? My dog's enjoying the Oh, it's a cute dog, dude. I thought it was the cat at first, but yeah, you're on the screen, I couldn't see too.

**Speaker B:** Well.

**Speaker A:** That's cool though, man. But yeah, uh, Jhanas, I don't know, I've read, I've read about them a few times. I didn't particularly find them all that, uh, important, like everything. Oh, hey dude, how's it going?

**Speaker C:** Hello, everything's okay. Hope everybody's well.

**Speaker A:** He's a good one to ask about jhanas. Oh, I bet he'll have some, uh, good jhana things.

**Speaker C:** What are we talking about? Tell you about jhanas? Okay, so let's see here. We can talk about jhanas like this. The Buddha said that the first jhana is the path. Okay, so when we talk about path, we can call it method, all right, or way of practice. And the first Jhana consists of— we could call it 10 things, okay— the removal of the 5 hindrances and then the inclusion of the 5 factors of the first Jhana, which are application and sustainment of thought through the wholesome, okay, a feeling of success a feeling of satisfaction, and then composing the mind in such a way that you're single-minded in your pursuit of this satisfaction. So what that means is having wholesome thoughts one after another. We can think about application and sustainment like ringing a bell and then listening to the reverberation, or we could call it noticing and then examining. Okay, and we're doing that with the wholesome— wholesome thoughts, wholesome attitudes. Wholesome long breaths, whatever it is we're doing it with wholesomeness as a goal there, okay, as a part of the investigation. That feeling of success and satisfaction we could talk about in really simple terms. People normally translate the word Piti as something like rapture or bliss, and this isn't a crazy way-off definition or translation, but oftentimes we associate rapture or bliss with something I don't know, supernatural, you could say. But really, the way to talk about it, I think, best is to talk about a feeling of success, like great success, joyous success. So you can think about being in like a desert environment and you're really thirsty, and you come up over a sand dune and you see some water that you can drink. At that point in time, you've completed the mission. You're going to experience success, great success. And then when you get to that water and you can start drinking from it, you're going to experience satisfaction. So this is the way that we can think about these two factors within the context of the first Jhana, is we apply and sustain the mind to the wholesome, and then we congratulate ourselves and experience success as we do so. And then that success kind of cools down a little bit into a state of satisfaction or happiness, and we're single-minded about how we do this. That's Akagata, that's that fifth factor of the first Jhana. And so if we look at the suttas, we can see that The way that the Jhana practice proceeds is a gradual cooling off of different factors of Jhana. So like moving from the first Jhana to the second Jhana, we stop or cease the application and sustainment of thought. Okay, it's no longer necessary to apply and sustain thought to the wholesome. We just start to experience that success, that satisfaction. And then also we come about to have the mind in a collected state. Okay, no longer generating distinctions, you could say. It's no longer scattered, it's together, it's made whole again. So same thing with moving from the second to the third Jhana, there's a cooling off of that kind of almost exciting feeling of success, so that what remains is satisfaction and collectedness, or making it whole. Okay, same with that fourth Jhana. Even that feeling of happiness cools down and it's replaced by a feeling of this is good enough, nothing needs to change. We can call this Upekkha or equanimity. And so these are the four jhanas that the Buddha talked about. Really, like we said earlier, he said the first jhana is the path. Anything past that, okay, all well and good, but really the first jhana is the method of practice that leads to the goal. Right now of getting out of dissatisfaction. Okay, I babbled about jhanas.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, that's great, great, wonderful. I guess I'm hoping that you— this is like kind of what you learn from Dhammarato, because that's kind of the perspective I'm interested in. I read a little bit about the jhanas before. So it seems to me that the first Jhana is quite an easy, open, that you can even have in a conversation. So it's more like a Sutta Jhana, which they call.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I mean, we could make distinctions, but really what it is, is it's coming out of superstition. Okay, so instead of wondering about when a beautiful bright light is going to come up and save us from suffering, we simply end it. Intentionally through our action in this moment, again and again, as often as we can remember to. So we can talk about that as a sutta Jhana, absolutely, because it's what the Buddha taught, you know. And the Buddha taught a Jhana that leads to the end of dissatisfaction right now, not some highly concentrated magical state that eliminates the world from your perception and you no longer have sense experience. This is all It's just not needed, and it's not going to do the job, if that makes sense. That's actually the kind of Jhana that the Buddha practiced before he woke up, is the kind of Jhana where everything is gone and you're in this state where, you know, you're not realizing what's going on around you. But what he recognized is when you come out of that state, it's still there. There's still dissatisfaction. So you get up and walk outside and someone steps on your foot and all of a sudden you're all pissed off again. And so the first Jhana that the Buddha taught is one where you can get your foot stepped on, like Devadatta threw a rock at him or something and it cut his foot up, and he was okay with that. He just said, I'm going to let my foot heal. You know, he didn't freak out about it. He didn't have a bad time. He just got satisfied right then and there and stayed satisfied. So we hear about this in the suttas because the Buddha would talk about it like this. He would say, when I practice Jhana, you know, my walking is celestial, my sitting is celestial, My laying is celestial. You know, all of these things are celestial. And we think about that in a supernatural way, but what he's really saying is it's above the world. It's in the world, but not of it. And so when we think of it in that way, you're absolutely right. Yeah, we can have Jhana during conversation. You could be in a Jhanic state while you're sitting, walking, laying down, all these things.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's just temporary thoughts, feelings, and emotions. Just Anicca, Samatha, anything outside of satisfaction.

**Speaker D:** But then again, sometimes when I listen— I haven't listened to even near— just beginning listening to Dhammarato, but I get the sense that when he talks about fourth Jhana, it's more like a highly concentrated Jhana, like, uh, yeah.

**Speaker B:** The Samadhi, Mahayana, or whatever you call it.

**Speaker C:** The way he talks about concentration isn't the normal way that we do it, like Normally, when people are talking about concentration, they're talking about basically staring at their nostrils, okay? One of the ways that we can think about this is with orange juice. In concentrated orange juice, they take the water out of it, okay? But nobody drinks concentrated orange juice out of the can. They put the water back into it. They make it whole. They collect it again into a unified whole, and then you can drink the orange juice and it tastes real good. So when we think about concentration, we could really talk about it in a way of collectedness. Okay, so not so much that we're eliminating things, but rather we are making them whole again. We're bringing them back together, you know, and we're talking about the mind in this case. So we're bringing the mind back together. And so that's also why the first Jhana is the one to really practice, you know, because like Dhammarato just said, these are all things that are Anicca. A good way to talk about Anicca is Nothing in this world can be maintained to my liking for very long. It's all going to get old, fall apart, and die. And if I pick it up and try to put it back together again, that's as useless as the king's men and the king's horses trying to put Humpty Dumpty back together. It's much better to just keep practicing being okay rather than worry about the way of the world, which like we talked about, Anicca, Anicca, Anicca. And so when we consider that, and we consider that within the context of the jhanas, what we're really doing, and this is why application and sustainment of thought is such an essential part of it, you know, we're practicing having wholesome thoughts one after another after another, and seeing what happens when we have those wholesome thoughts, you know. So we're ringing the bell and letting it reverberate. And the only reason I don't talk so much about, you know, the fourth jhana, this and that, and this is what it's like and whatnot, is A, that loads us up to go searching for some sort of experience, which searching for an experience is just going to lead to more dissatisfaction. That's the regular way that we did things, rather than focusing on being here now and being satisfied now. Because as soon as we come out of dissatisfaction, that's it, the work is done. You know, there's no more work to do. Everything's just fine and dandy. You know, it's really when we see ourselves slip into dissatisfaction that there's something to do. Once that's done, nothing to do, nowhere to go, everything's okay. So the Jhanas can be interesting to play with, but the first Jhana is the one to play the most with, you know.

**Speaker A:** And Dhammarato would tell you, he's not a scholar, you know. And a lot of people, and this is what I've learned from him anyway, people could agree or disagree, that's fine. But what I got from Dhammarato's teachings is if you ask him about Dhammarato's teachings, he will tell you, I'm not teaching you from me, I'm teaching you what the Buddha taught. I didn't come up with this stuff. And Dhammarato, like Buddhadasa Bhikkhu, found when they did read the Pali Canon and practice those things, you don't need a whole bunch of books to tell you. You need a few sentences. Don't worry, be happy. Dhammarato said if you want to be a scholar, if you want to read books, the most important book to read is between your own ears. And for a lot of people who are just meeting Dhammarato or just getting introduced into this Sangha, it's a very— it can be confusing for them to see, like, wait, this is a place where we're not impressed by scholarly activities. We're not impressed by gathering knowledge or winning races or climbing mountains. It's very interesting to watch people hear things like this, and you almost get uncomfortable. Like, wait, what? Like my whole life I had these, uh, Samskaras of, uh, climbing mountains, running races, taking out the garbage to get my parents' affection, going to university to get my professor and parents, you know. And we're in the practice of breathing and relaxing. This is the true Dharma— breathing and relaxing. So simple that a child could understand it, available to all. It's good in the beginning, the middle, and the end. When it's not good in the beginning, in the middle, and the end, when we're searching for something— no, but you got to do this, and I got to describe this, and I got to get here— it's all bullshit. Because once you get there, what are you going to do when you get to this blissful state? I'll tell you what you're going to do. You're going to want more of it. How do I sustain— now I got here, how do I sustain this thing? How do I do this? And that's not reality. It's not going to sustain this blissful thing in my mind. Ironically, you can— if you want to get to blissful states of Jhanas and all these things, you have to not give a fuck about any of that shit. Who cares about enlightenment? We're already enlightened when we give up the pursuit of enlightenment. We're already perfect when we give up the pursuit of perfection. Life is just life. We can either accept it or go searching after Jhanas all day long, you know.

**Speaker C:** That's why the really special thing about it is it's very ordinary.

**Speaker A:** Ordinary, yeah.

**Speaker C:** Very ordinary.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the thing I like about, um, like having met you guys and listening to Dhammarato. Yeah, I spent many— like a lot of people, probably many, many, many years going, oh, is rebirth true? Is this true? And trying to, with my logical mind, work all this stuff out. And after years of this, I just was like, this is crap. I've got to make a decision here. Either I spend the rest of my life asking these questions that I can't answer, or I just stop and just practice, just put into practice what I'm reading. Like, because otherwise it's just— I'm just wasting my time. So, um, yeah, so whenever I— or there's been times where I ask questions and it's like, it doesn't matter, like the answer doesn't matter, just, just— that's right, it's just— I'm already okay. Yeah, it's just about— that's our whole.

**Speaker A:** Present Remember that what Alexander just said, everything's okay here and now. I would, if Dhammarato feels different, I would like to know, but from what I get from him, the only practice is remembering what Alexander just said. That's all the practice you need. Breathing, relaxing, everything's okay. That's Anapanasati, that's normal Sati, that's the Eightfold Path. That's everything. That's all you could ever want, is breathing. That's what Dhammarato and the Buddha teach. That's what Buddhadasa Bhikkhu teaches, or did teach. But people don't like that. They want to be tested on their Pali language. They want to be tested on their knowledge. They want to wear the fancy robes. They want to get the the acclaims. They want to go up the classes. This is what they want, and you'll find it all over the place. So this is why Dhammarato's presentation of the Buddhist teaching discussion is unique, because it's— personally, it's more accurate. It's not— it's less glamour and glitter and rainbows. It's more real world. But in a way, that's what makes it so miraculous, is that it is so available here and now, you know. Oftentimes I can remember. Yes.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely.

**Speaker A:** Does that make any sense?

**Speaker D:** I hear that, yeah, Dhamma teaching, I'm quite familiar with but I didn't really hear an answer about the fourth jhana. I'm cute. That's really what I'm curious. And I, I, I agree with a lot of what you said, but I—.

**Speaker A:** What about the— You know anything about the fourth jhana, Alexander?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, sure, we can talk about it. What is the specific question?

**Speaker D:** Uh, because I just listening to him to a few YouTubers. It seems like the first jhana is very sutta jhana, open, and you can have it in a conversation. And then when he talks about the fourth jhana, it's like absorption jhana. And I might have misunderstood that totally.

**Speaker C:** Or— So tell me what an absorption jhana is. Tell me what absorption is.

**Speaker D:** Okay, if you're in absorption and I go and touch you on the shoulder, you won't feel the touch.

**Speaker C:** Will I not feel the touch, or will I not care that you're touching me?

**Speaker D:** You will not feel the touch.

**Speaker C:** Okay, well, that sounds a little magical to me. It's entirely possible that you can do something like that. I would imagine that you would need a proper container for that experience. A proper container for that experience might be something like a monastery, might be something like seclusion in a forest. Might be something like a cave. Okay, now if you think that we're going to do this while we're out here in the world, likely you're going to be searching for something for a while, you know. So this is one of the reasons why— who cares about the fourth jhana? Everything's already all right. Who really cares about third, second, or first jhana as long as you can recognize that all you really need is this next breath? You stop breathing and you die, and then you're not going to worry about anybody touching your shoulder anymore. So the best thing to do is to be in this moment and be satisfied right now. But if you're looking for experiences like that, then you're going to have to go ahead and probably do something a little different than the worldly way of doing things. And so if you go off and find something like that, a good environment to practice in with a lot of good friends around that are really supportive of what you're doing and whatnot, you may find what you're looking for when you're describing, you know, this idea of the fourth Jhana that you have. However, even then, when you come out of that Jhana, likely you're not going to do anything other than feel dissatisfied if you feel like that's the goal. But the Buddha only taught two things: Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. So, A, there's Dukkha in looking for fourth Jhana, looking for it. Okay, that's one of the reasons why I say that moving from Jhana to Jhana is a cooling off or a dropping away of the factors that are considered to be coarse in nature. Okay, so we move from a coarse state of mind to a finer and a finer and a finer state of mind. Now, the real benefit of doing this is coming back to a coarse state of mind again, because you get to see what your mind is doing as it puts together or fabricates or concocts your experience of moment-to-moment life. Okay, so the value is not in not allowing your shoulder to be felt. The value is in seeing the way that as the mind calms down, we make less and less distinctions, and we find that things are already even more okay than we thought they were. Okay, so then we get to see, coming back out of it, the ways in which you fabricate your own experience. Now, your own experience, likely, if it's, you know, moving like this because you're searching for things, is going to involve a lot of liking and not liking. Okay, so we can talk about equanimity as I don't care. Okay, I don't care what's happening. This is equanimity. I don't care. It's not going to impact my satisfaction. Okay, so when we move out of a state of equanimity, of great equanimity like the one that you're talking about, kind of, you know, we don't have to talk about it in a manner of absorption. Okay, because the Buddha didn't teach absorption. The Buddha knew about absorption meditation and other such things. That was the kind of practice that he was doing before he woke up underneath of that tree and saw that everything was already okay, and then went to tell other people how to get that going for themselves. So absorption is a later addition to the teachings of the Buddha, okay? It's not the teachings of the Buddha, all right? And the reason for that is because it's not useful for dukkha, dukkha, Nirodha. And he found that out when he was with his first two teachers that taught him about what do we call it, the formless realms, the base of nothingness and neither perception nor non-perception. He was here, he was doing all of this, and the Buddha was the best at practicing like this. His teachers were like, oh man, you got it, you can come be a teacher too. And he's like, nah, I don't think so, I don't like it that much, it's not working. And so he went to another teacher, oh, you're so great at doing this, good job, man, you want to come here and be the teacher too? And he said, no, I don't like it, it doesn't work. And he went off and figured it out on his own, you know. So that's the reason that I say that these absorption jhanas are not likely to be the teachings of the Buddha insofar as how to actually practice correctly, but we could also just say effectively, you know, how to practice effectively. Because when he came out of these absorptions, he found that there was still Dukkha. So to go after him is fine and dandy, but recognize that you're playing with a toy Okay, rather than figuring out how to end dissatisfaction right now. And the reason to say that again is because he said out loud, you know, first Jhana is the path. He said that a few times. And so when we determine the further escape from the first Jhana has no dissatisfaction within it, you get what I'm saying? So a further escape from dissatisfaction just lessens those factors of the Jhana that could get chased after basically to the point where you're like, I don't care. It's all good. Touch my shoulder. I'm not moving. I'm here. I'm down. I got nothing to do for a while. Coming back out of it, you see those coarse factors get added back in. And so you can kind of get to understand, and this is why he talked about Samatha and Vipassana being connected like this, because one of the ways we could talk about Samatha, and this is how it's translated in the Chinese, is stopping. Stopping the stories, stopping the Dukkha, calming down, settling down with the activity of the mind and the body so that you can do Vipassana, which is seeing things clearly. And the thing that you're seeing clearly is everything's okay, there's no problems, I got nothing to do and nowhere to go, I can just take this breath and be happy as can be, it's not a problem. So as we do that over and over again, we can let those things cool down themselves, those factors, those coarser factors, and we can start to see everything's really okay, everything's really not a problem. And then as we add those coarse factors back in, we can find that, okay, I can kind of see how I'm generating my own dissatisfaction at times. And then when we see that and it becomes even more coarse because we're mad about something or we're being greedy or we've got hatred towards something, we can go, aha, I see you, and we can put a stop to it. Because the mind is fast, it's really, really fast. And so as we slow it down more and more and then allow it to speed back up, we see how it's working, we watch how the mind is working and we see what it's doing. And so when it starts spinning up real fast, we can go, oh no, no more of that, I'm just going to take a deep breath. But really the whole point of the practice is to realize I can just do this right now, I got it, there's nothing to it, I can do it over and over again so long as I remember to wake up, look at what I'm doing, change stuff towards the wholesome, and then congratulate myself for having done so. So really the whole practice is still one after another, wholesome thoughts, nice breaths, everything's okay. I don't know if that really answers your question about the fourth Jhana, but it does kind of exhaust my talking about it, if that makes sense.

**Speaker A:** It's just breathing, relax.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** I guess that was, uh, um, it's a no. It's not an absorption.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, not likely. I'm not saying you can't get really intensely focused on an object and find yourself having some magical-ass experiences, but that's what they are. They're experiences. They're no better or not looking at any other experience.

**Speaker D:** I'm not looking for absorption, Janus. I just want to understand what discussion with Bhikkhuni, his teaching is on that, because sometimes it's not so clear. And I think you've met him more and watched more YouTubes than me.

**Speaker C:** So, well, it's good to leave things like that in the abstract, if that makes sense. It's okay to talk about it as this is a really good time, this is really cool, I'm really cooled off, everything is really okay, I can really see that there's no problems. You know, but to start talking about like, oh, there will be a bright light and a white sheet covers your body and you turn into a ghost and all these things, then people just get all wound up looking for that rather than being okay. And we don't want to get wound up, we want to unwind.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, then when you get some experience, it's quite good to know where you are and what's happening. I don't know, in my experience.

**Speaker A:** You can only be here and now. Yeah, either satisfied or you're not satisfied. Either hunting or you're satisfied.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, maps can be fun to play with, but they're not the terrain.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I think they're cool, but I wouldn't hold too fast to them.

**Speaker C:** Exactly. Yeah, if you stick your nose in a map while you're walking around, you're going to walk off a cliff.

**Speaker A:** And a lot of the maps are wrong.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** At least outdated, like Jesus's followers. You know, Jesus said some really amazing things, but there's a lot of wrong maps in that Bible, boy.

**Speaker C:** Stuff gets weird when you play telephone for a few thousand years. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And, um, even though they had, uh, in many ancient traditions you can like tell stories and and hand down information and wisdom and stuff. They're still writing in the Buddha's time. And it always does speak to me that he didn't really find it necessary to write down a lot of this stuff. I'm sure in his life he wrote stuff, but as far as what we know, he could have. It seems like he was in a great position to write a whole bunch of things about it, but his students did. Just like Dhammarato.

**Speaker D:** Anicca didn't write so much in those times. Well, his students should have memorized it. They memorized it.

**Speaker A:** Well, somebody wrote it down because we have it today.

**Speaker D:** Quite a few years later. Quite a few years later.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, it's available online if you want to go search for it. You find all of the rigid details you're looking for in there.

**Speaker C:** One of the best details that you'll find in those suttas is that association with good people is really important. And that's because you can talk about things all day, and I can pass on a story down generations, but as it gets written down, things change. They get added. In. Like maybe someone puts in the book that dependent origination unfolds over 3 lifetimes rather than right now, and then people are confused about things like death and birth and what happens, and they start to talk about that rather than just being okay. So the suttas are great if you know how to read, but you don't learn how to read on your own. Someone has to teach you how to read. And if they don't know how to read, then where are you going? Likely it becomes a situation where the blind are leading the blind. So what the Buddha really said that was important is find a good community of practitioners so that everybody can be okay and do a whole lot of nothing all together.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and Buddhists are really usually interested in— Buddhists in name only are really interested in all the details and that stuff. But from Dhammarato's teachings, you know, we're not Buddhists. You know, we practice the truth. We practice reality. We live in reality, not fairy tales. You know, when we're breathing and we're relaxed and we're satisfied, this is Nibbana. You know, what does Nibbana mean? To take our mind off of the fire and let it cool down. There's nothing wrong with being interested in this stuff whatsoever. But it's not Dharma practice. It's just more— it's just more searching. Try, try like Ram Dass said, try being a finder. Try finding it here and now. But what about this? But what about that? But I want to have the most knowledge and do this. Like I said, AI is available. It's all there. There's, there's sutta-central.com. Type in any sutta you want, it's there in detail. But that's not what we're teaching. We're teaching breathing and relaxation and friendship. This is the true Dharma.

**Speaker B:** You know.

**Speaker A:** This is the true practice. But people don't like that. They want— they want it on paper. They want to be searchers like dogs running after a rabbit. You want to go find stuff, don't you? You want to go be the best student, don't you? Yeah, we all do, but it doesn't lead anywhere. Letting it go. You want to be the best student? Let it all go. Let all that bullshit go. It's just going to pass anyway. You hit your head on a rock, then where's all this knowledge? Where's all this Jhanas? Only reality will remain. So anyways, if anybody has anything else they want to say before we go, feel free.

**Speaker C:** So I appreciate you guys. Thank you so much for hosting, Dhamma Das. I always look forward to these calls.

**Speaker A:** Thank you, Alexander. You're so welcome, friend. Thank you, Luke. Thank you, Patrick.

**Speaker B:** Thanks, guys. Thank you.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, thank you, Patrick. I really appreciate the conversation.

**Speaker A:** I had a really good time. You're welcome, bud.

**Speaker D:** Me too.

**Speaker C:** Talk to you guys again soon. Later, friends.

**Speaker D:** Cheers.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato and Sangha friends, centers on the practical, down-to-earth application of Buddhist teachings to daily life, emphasizing **letting go, finding satisfaction in the present moment, and avoiding dogmatic attachments.**

Here is a summary of the key themes and insights:

### Core Themes

1.  **The Essence of Practice is Letting Go:** The primary practice discussed is not complex rituals or intense concentration, but the simple, moment-to-moment act of **remembering to let go** of stress, drama, and unwholesome thoughts. The Buddha's analogy of holding anger like a "hot stone" is used to illustrate the self-inflicted nature of suffering.

2.  **Dharma in Daily Life, Not Just on the Cushion:** True practice is tested in the chaos of everyday life—working from home, dealing with family, and navigating interpersonal stress. As one speaker notes, "if it doesn't work in traffic, what's the point?" The ideal is to find peace *within* worldly responsibilities, not by escaping them.

3.  **Warning Against "Dharma Clinging":** The group cautions against attaching to the Dharma itself—becoming rigid about rituals, rules, or "being right." They share stories of negative experiences in other traditions where etiquette was enforced harshly, missing the core point. **"Ironically clinging entirely to the Dhamma is letting it go, is just breathing and relaxing."**

4.  **The Primacy of the First Jhana (as a Path):** A significant portion of the talk demystifies the *jhanas* (meditative absorptions). The teaching, aligned with Buddhadasa Bhikkhu, is that the **First Jhana is the essential path**. It is defined not as a trance, but as a mindful framework for daily life:
    *   **Removing the Five Hindrances** (doubt, ill-will, etc.).
    *   **Applying and sustaining wholesome thoughts** (e.g., kindness, contentment).
    *   **Feeling the success and satisfaction** of that wholesome intention.
    This "Sutta Jhana" is accessible during any activity—conversation, work, or walking—and leads to a collected, satisfied mind. The higher jhanas are seen as natural byproducts of this cooling down, not goals to be chased.

5.  **The Trap of Seeking Special Experiences:** The group warns against seeking dramatic "absorption jhanas" or supernatural experiences. This is seen as just another form of craving that leads away from present-moment satisfaction. **"The less you want it, the more likely you're going to get it."** The goal is to end dissatisfaction now, not to attain special states.

6.  **The Value of Silence and Simplicity:** Speakers find deep peace in silence, nature, and simple activities like walking in a graveyard (which provides perspective on impermanence). They critique the modern urge for constant noise, stimulation, and accumulation—whether of possessions, travel, or even spiritual knowledge.

7.  **Community and Friendship:** The Sangha is emphasized as a vital support for practice—a place for "friendship" and "doing a whole lot of nothing all together." However, they also acknowledge human imperfection within communities, using it as another opportunity to practice letting go of expectations.

### Key Takeaways

*   **The central instruction is: "Breathe and relax. Everything is okay here and now."**
*   Practice is about **remembering** this truth amidst life's drama, not about acquiring more knowledge or achieving altered states.
*   All phenomena are **Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta** (impermanent, unsatisfactory, not-self). Seeing this clearly is wisdom, which naturally leads to letting go.
*   The simplest, most ordinary peace—the "silence of the heart"—is the true Dhamma. It is always available and requires no special conditions.

In essence, this talk presents a **non-dogmatic, accessible, and highly practical approach** to the Dharma, stripping away complex doctrine to focus on the heart of the Buddha's teaching: the end of suffering in this very moment through letting go and cultivating a satisfied mind.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used in the talk:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Holding a hot stone:** Used to describe holding onto anger or negative states. The Buddha's analogy is cited: holding anger is like holding a hot stone—you're the one who gets burned.
2.  **Dye in a fishbowl:** Describes how negative emotions (like anger) enter the mind. The practice is about preventing the "dye" from entering, but once it's in, you must wait for it to clear (you can't force it out faster).
3.  **The doorway of letting go:** Letting go is described as finding a "doorway" out of suffering—a subtle but accessible shift in perspective.
4.  **Silence of the heart:** True Dhamma is described not just as silence of words, but as the "silence of the heart" or "silence of all things," where internal competition and chatter end.
5.  **Everything is automatic:** Life is compared to an automatic process. The only manual action needed is to "set down the hammer" if you're hitting yourself with one (i.e., stop creating your own suffering).
6.  **If it doesn't work in traffic, what's the point?:** A metaphor (attributed to UG Krishnamurti) stressing that a spiritual practice must hold up in everyday, stressful situations, not just in retreat or isolation.
7.  **Ringing a bell and listening to the reverberation:** Used to explain the Jhanic factors of "application and sustainment" of thought—you initiate a wholesome thought (ring the bell) and then observe its effect (the reverberation).
8.  **Finding water in a desert:** Describes the feeling of success (*piti*) in the first Jhana—like the joyous relief of a thirsty person finding an oasis.
9.  **Concentrated orange juice:** Explains *samadhi* (concentration) not as narrowing focus, but as "collectedness"—like adding water back to concentrated juice to make a unified, wholesome whole.
10. **Maps vs. terrain:** Discussing detailed Jhana maps is like studying a map instead of walking the actual terrain. Sticking too close to the map (intellectual knowledge) can make you "walk off a cliff" in your actual practice.
11. **Playing telephone:** The potential corruption of original teachings over millennia is compared to the game of "telephone," where messages get distorted as they are passed down.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **Attachment to ritual in Tibetan Buddhism:** Speaker B shares two personal stories:
    *   Being yelled at for eating before a teacher (who himself found it funny).
    *   An Australian man's wife being yelled at for placing a book on the floor (a cultural faux pas).
    *   These illustrate the danger of clinging to rituals and etiquette over the essence of the practice.

2.  **The Thai ghost story:** Speaker B recounts a story of a Thai woman who refused to sleep in her own house after her husband died there, fearing his ghost. This highlights how cultural superstitions can create suffering, contrasting with the peace the speakers find in cemeteries.

3.  **The Indian/Taiwanese monk in the cemetery:** A monk finds peace in cemeteries because local people, fearing ghosts, avoid them. This story reinforces the theme of finding silence and peace in unlikely, socially avoided places.

4.  **The Buddha's injury:** Reference to the story where Devadatta throws a rock at the Buddha, injuring his foot. The Buddha's calm response—simply tending to the wound without anger—is used as an example of practicing Jhana (equanimity) in the midst of worldly difficulty.

5.  **The Buddha's pre-enlightenment teachers:** The story is recalled of the Buddha mastering deep absorptive states (the "formless realms") under his teachers, realizing they didn't lead to the end of suffering, and thus moving on to discover his own path. This is used to argue that "absorption Jhanas" are not the core of his later teaching.

### **Overarching Narrative Metaphors**
*   **Life as a game or play (Lila):** Walking through a graveyard reveals life as a temporary "game" where everyone ends the same way.
*   **The mind as a manipulative suggestion engine:** The mind is seen as constantly offering random, half-good, half-bad suggestions; clinging to them releases the "chemicals" of emotion.
*   **Household life as monastic practice:** Daily chores like washing dishes are reframed as no different from the mindful work done in a monastery; the labels ("householder," "monk") are ultimately unimportant.

These metaphors and stories collectively build a theme of **finding peace through simplicity, letting go, and practicing in the midst of ordinary—and often messy—daily life,** rather than through complex philosophy, rigid rituals, or the pursuit of special experiences.
