### Transcript


**Speaker A:** I'm not attached to the word meditation at all. It's been so misused that most of what meditation actually winds up being in practice is not what we're doing here. We're doing Anapanasati. The question is, is Anapanasati, corrected practice, is that meditation or not? And I'll be on the side that argues against it.

**Speaker B:** That doesn't matter.

**Speaker A:** But it doesn't matter. I— yes, I did. I saw, I saw what you wrote, and, uh, both sides of that needs to be addressed because you're seeing is one or the other, and in fact Both of them need investigation. So let's take the second part first, which was that you don't want to sit down to meditate,

**Speaker B:** which means I'm not doing it right, right?

**Speaker A:** Which is what you're telling me, uh, uh, would be, uh, one definition of meditation. And on another front, or another way you're saying it, is, is that you really don't want to sit down and relax and enjoy the moment. And I find that kind of hard to believe.

**Speaker B:** I mean, if I was trying to enjoy the moment, maybe that would be good. But if I'm trying to like focus on the breath and make sure that my mind doesn't wander I can daydream for 15 minutes. I don't think that's what you want to do.

**Speaker A:** I, I, I understand, uh, the concept of focusing or concentration, and both of them have an exclusionary quality. Uh, basically, they— the, the idea is let's throw out all of the that are not important and keep only the important things. That's one way of looking at it. But when we're looking at Anapanasati, then we're not looking for focus at all. Rather, we're looking for gathering together the factors that are needed. And when we gather the factors together that are needed, that's actually in many cases exactly opposite of focus or concentration. But we can mention that without spending a whole lot of time on it. Rather than saying focus on the breathing, what we're going to do is at least occasionally like on the in-breath, uh, notice that this is a long, deep in-breath. It doesn't take very long to do that. It's not one mind moment after another mind moment after another mind moment, looking at every little tiny little thing and don't miss anything. That's not the practice. It's rather mindfully that you're breathing in, because there's going to be a whole lot of other stuff to do. And then mindfully breathe out long. Because we're looking for a kind of breath that has, let us say, two qualities to it or two results, and actually there are three. But the first two results that are immediate just by reading the sutta is that we become more familiar with the body, we get to know the body. By watching the breath, we begin to watch the body. And by watching the breath, we become more into the senses, especially the senses around breathing, especially in the sense that breathing in long and breathing out long— how do you know you're doing that? Do you look in a mirror? No. Do you need a camera? Maybe one of those parts of the machine of lie detectors that measure respiration by putting a rubber band around you and measure it with an old-timey machine. Is that how we're going to do that? Or is it something that you're aware of inside? Yeah, that's the way that we know that it's a long breath, is because we've experience it as a long breath, which means we experience the body breathing long. So that's also part of our knowledge— mindfully experiencing the body as it's breathing, mindfully experiencing and waking up the body and becoming more familiar with being in the body. And you can do that anytime. It's got nothing to do with sitting on the floor, but it is easier to remember to do it just any old time if you've already practiced doing it sitting on the floor. Okay, just like the piano student only needs to play that piano recital piece one time, and that's in the recital. Right, but we need a practice time too to practice it, otherwise we're not going to do any good when we need to do it. So that example is exactly what I mean by Murphy's Law, that we're practicing on the side to get ready for tough times ahead, because you're sure going to have them. Okay, and the reason you're going to have them is because you call them tough. And the reason you call them tough is because you're not paying attention. And the reason you're not paying attention is because you're not mindful, you're not waking up. But if you do wake up, you can recognize that what's happening right now is no big deal. I can handle this. Okay, so going in that direction is not focusing on the breathing at all, but rather the whole Anapanasati practice is using the breath as an anchor to basically to be here now in the present moment, which is, by the way, very pleasant. As opposed to the past or the future. When we're thinking about the past, when we're thinking about the future, when we're thinking about out yonder and over there and way back when and maybe tomorrow, that's all kind of critical thinking, trying to compare this with that, and this needs to be done, and that was a failure, and this was good, and all this judgments. But when we're in the present moment, nothing much is happening, and so there's no comparisons to be made. So that's one form of hindrance that we don't have to do, is doubt. We don't have to be in doubt. Everything right now is okay. And I find it very ridiculous that so many Western meditators have such a bad idea about meditation that they think that it's work rather than learning to not work. My dad had a saying that I liked very much. It was a funny saying. He says, "Work? I'm not afraid of work. I can lay down beside it and go to sleep." Now that's a funny joke from him, because he was actually a worker. He really did. Hard to keep up with him. So this is the whole point, is that you say that you don't want to meditate. And what I hear is that you have one of two things. One is either the wrong attitude about what meditation is. Or number 2, you've got a really, really weird attitude about human existence, because everybody else I know would rather be joyful and happy and free from worries and sorrows and being able to be happy and content. And so that we can eliminate that, that you're not actually out there intentionally trying to harm yourself, that you would actually— you're out there intending to do yourself some value. Okay, so now all we have to work on is what is of value, because now we're going to the point of meditation is not of value, it's not going to take me in the direction of well-being and harmony. And so that's where we have to approach this. Is that in a way, we kind of want to do the meditation because the benefits of it are quite strike. They're strike stark, they're visible and immediate and present. We can see the benefit immediately from it. That's the way to practice meditation. Is we're doing it because it's good to do that, as opposed to doing a bunch of other stuff. It's not as enjoyable as just sitting and doing bhikkhuni.

**Speaker B:** I feel like I like meditating in a sense, but yeah, it still feels like work. It feels like enjoyable work, I suppose.

**Speaker A:** Well, perhaps then that we're talking about the issue of one's right effort, because right effort is actually the key to that, in the sense that effort is effort depending upon our attitude. And when we change the attitude, and the attitude can get changed through success, Okay, so once you begin to see the change or see the results and see the benefit, we begin to change our attitude. All right, but the attitude then is related to one's right effort. And to give— I'll give you this example. Um, mom goes into the kitchen and she sees that that there's a lot of trash, a lot of garbage all piled up. And she says, "Ah," and she gets exasperated. And then she, with or without exasperation, she asks her teenage son to go take out the trash. Well, he does it, but he doesn't want to. He's only doing it because mom is fussed at him about it. Or maybe they had a squabble, but then he goes and he does it. But when he's doing it now, he does it in a way that's a great effort, because for him he's doing it with great effort because he doesn't want to do it. Now, another story. Another story is that that same teenager walks into the kitchen before his mom, sees the trash buildup, and says, "Hot dog, I know my mom would be really proud of me if I took that trash out." And so he'll pick it up and he'll take it out. Now, which trip out to the garbage did he feel better about? The one where he was told that he had to do it, or the one when he figured out it was a good idea to do it? The second one. Okay, now we're going in the direction of what is the motivation? And when the motivation becomes joyful and enthusiastic, then the effort is not effort at all, but rather it becomes energetic. It's almost like it pops up because we like it, and it's a matter of developing attitude.

**Speaker B:** I think my motivation is like delayed gratification, like I'll do this and it will make me happier.

**Speaker A:** No, that's the wrong attitude. Rather, I do this because it is happiness, rather than delayed gratification. That's what you've got in your mind: I've got to do the work and then I can be happy. Same old, same old. That's the way we've always done things. Delayed gratification to where this is the gratification. As soon as you remember, you can take that breath and says, well, this is a whole lot better right now. It comes. What is it that we're changing? The thoughts from unwholesome to wholesome thoughts. And one of your unwholesome thoughts is, gosh darn it, this is a lot of work, but I'll get some happiness out of it someplace. And that's an unwholesome thought. The first thing we want to do is throw out those kind of unwholesome thoughts and have the wholesome thought of this is nice. Not someday if I work hard it will be nice. It's nice right now.

**Speaker B:** So you should kind of like, maybe not focus, but pay attention to the

**Speaker A:** joy and try to— Pay attention to fearlessness. Pay attention to your fear and especially lack of it. Pay attention to your discomfort and more particularly, the lack of it. Which is comfort, comfort, safety, security, and now we look for dissatisfaction, and when dissatisfaction is not there, which is where is satisfaction? And now we have safety, security, comfort, and satisfaction, and we have completed the definition of the Buddhist Pali word Sukkha. That's actually— that's the goal. That's, let us say, the immediate goal. The immediate goal is Sukkha. And sometimes we have to practice that over and over again because it flitters away. And then we practice it again, and it comes, and there it goes again. It goes with every unwholesome thought that arises. But if we can keep the thoughts wholesome and know— and, uh, it's kind of like this. It's kind of like digging a big hole in the desert, and while we're digging a hole in the desert, the desert keeps filling in sand, both from gravity and because of the wind. And that happens with every mind moment, that we dig a little space in there and then all this garbage falls right back in. But we keep digging anyway. The more we dig, the less we have to deal with the stuff coming back in. But we have to appreciate the fact that, hey, we've got a hole here.

**Speaker B:** It's a practice being great, right?

**Speaker A:** We've gotten started. We've got a hole here. We've got some satisfaction going. Let's do it again. If it fills up with sand, that's all right, I can do it again. Back to satisfaction, back to satisfaction, over and over again.

**Speaker B:** Kind of. Do you know the Sisyphus?

**Speaker A:** Uh, yes, you're talking about Sisyphus and the, uh, and the stone. Yeah. Okay. Here's my take on the stone. Getting it at least close to the top of the hill, and then the right thing to do is to sit down on top of the hill, and with your feet you kick it back down to the bottom because you don't need that stone anyway. But actually, we all are Sisyphus in the sense of why put in the effort? Why bother? Because it's worth it, right? Why bother? Because I always keep failing. Oh, poor me. So it's both a pity party, and it is also, uh, the, uh, the word would be sloth, which is a hindrance. And the hindrance is based upon doubt. And the doubt in that sense is the doubt that he'll ever get it up there. We're using a completely different analogy because we can get it up there. We got it up there and then we saw it roll down again. And so, all right, let's go make a nice platform for this thing and then we'll roll it back up there again and let it sit on this platform. It'll stay there for a while and then the wind or something, the sand erodes or whatever, and it falls back down. Never mind, go get the darn thing. We've got it up here We'll get it up here again, and we'll prop it up even better this time.

**Speaker B:** We'll get farther up the hill.

**Speaker A:** Right, because we know how to do this. We've got the confidence that we can keep going, because we know that we've got the benefits. See, you're the guy who is the Sisyphus that never gets it halfway up the hill before it falls.

**Speaker B:** I feel like the sloth hindrance is probably better. You say a hindrance is probably my biggest hindrance.

**Speaker A:** Yes, the hindrance of sloth, this built-in doubt, which basically has the terminology of what's the point, what's the use.

**Speaker B:** I'm not making any progress, that type.

**Speaker A:** Right. There have been songs about it. One of them is, "Is that all there is?" Is that all there is? I mean, life is like that. You're going to find something, and when you get it, is that all there is?

**Speaker B:** It's like a heat on a stick treadmill.

**Speaker A:** So when people want life immortal, They want to live forever, and then they become a vampire, and then they say, is that all there is? Just constant thirst for blood. So that's an attitude of Sisyphus, is that all there is to it? And what all there is to it is constant failure, one failure after another failure after another failure. But in this practice, it's actually so dead easy to do it. It really is. You can actually stop what you're thinking and think something new. And that's basically all we have to do, is to recognize that what we're thinking is unwholesome, and we decide we're going to have wholesome thoughts. And wholesome thoughts are a whole lot more enjoyable than unwholesome thoughts. Right then and there, within a, let us say, at least a quarter of a second, you're able to change that thought from an unwholesome to a wholesome thought. So in the next few mind moments, that thought, if it continues, will allow the feelings to kick in. But if it's a wholesome, unwholesome, unwholesome, unwholesome, wholesome, unwholesome, unwholesome, unwholesome, wholesome, unwholesome, unwholesome, unwholesome, mostly in the unwholesome. But if we start getting it wholesome, wholesome, wholesome, wholesome, then we begin to really enjoy the benefit. This is why the Buddha talks about applied and sustained thought, that we apply it to the wholesome and then keep the wholesome going. But the motivation of keeping the wholesome going is because it's so much better than the unwholesome.

**Speaker B:** And so the wholesomeness would be, at least I'm meditating as well as I'm meditating. At least I feel as good as I feel. Or maybe not at least, it's still a bad attitude, but I feel— All

**Speaker A:** right, I'm not attached to the word meditation at all. It's been so misused that most of what meditation actually winds up being in practice is not what we're doing here. We're doing Anapanasati. The question is, is Anapanasati, corrected practice, is that meditation or not? And I'll be on the side that argues against it.

**Speaker B:** That doesn't matter.

**Speaker A:** But it doesn't matter. What does matter is, in fact, if someone is practicing meditation correctly, they're not worried about is this meditation or not. They're more focused on how nice this is. So the job— and peaceful this is, how relaxed this is, how no problems and no worries and nothing to do and no place to go. What a relaxed state of being. Wow. And when we talk about it like that, it frightens some people. But that's because they're afraid of things, and if they would address that fear and become fearless, then they would really like being relaxed. So we have to practice becoming fearless because we spend our whole lives being afraid of this, that, and the other thing, especially the things that might happen. Hypothetical, right? The fear of the hypothetical and the fear of the false positive is about all the fear we've got left. And it's not good fear, especially if we're wise, because if we're wise, we will avoid real fear. We'll see it far enough in advance to avoid it and take the other journeys, or take the other path,

**Speaker B:** and we live in Anagami.

**Speaker A:** So we can get away with it. If you see the danger in advance, then we can just maneuver away from it, which means now there's nothing to fear because we're wise enough to stay out of danger. And so because we are wise enough to stay out of danger right now, there's nothing to fear.

**Speaker B:** We believe in ourselves.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Confidence. That's what we've been talking about. The Pali word is shraddha. Shraddha. I wouldn't call it believing in oneself. That's what religious people do. This is actually better than that because this is knowing This is confidence.

**Speaker B:** There's no need for belief, right?

**Speaker A:** No need for belief. I understand that that's a common statement of believe in yourself, but that's because that's all they have. We've got something much better than that, and that is results. Okay, positive that this stuff works. If you do it one time and it works, you do it again, it works, and you do it again and it works, and you do it in again, and it works. You not only are you getting the habit of doing it, but you're also getting the confidence. And when you, when you think, oh, I should meditate, and then you have the thought, oh, I don't want to meditate, both of those are wrong thoughts. Those are both unwholesome thoughts. So wakey wakey, and recognize the next thought should be a wholesome thought. And what is that? Hey, I'm meditating right now. This is meditation. In-breath meditation, out-breath meditation. It feels a whole lot better than having an internal squabble. You ought to meditate. I don't want to. You ought to meditate. I don't want to. So you see the distinction there. One is an argument between the superego and the id, or the parent and the child, and the other one is the adult. The adult says, yep, doing it. So that's the kind of attitude change that we need, is that we can do this, and it's nice when we do it, and it's almost better than anything else

**Speaker B:** sometimes.

**Speaker A:** And so what we do do, we only do into the service of keeping this non-doing going.

**Speaker B:** So would the best meditation literally be— not for me, but for like an advanced practitioner— would the best meditation be do nothing?

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Where do you think the Zen haiku comes from? Well, no place to go and nothing to do, and the grass— and the spring comes and the grass grows by itself. No place to go, nothing to do, just sitting here. The grass— uh, the spring comes and the grass grows by itself. This is actually the goal of every workman. Name me a workman who does not plan on retiring. When is the workman's work done?

**Speaker B:** Never, if he likes it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so the answer should be, if one is wise, right now! I'm done, I'm finished!

**Speaker B:** Does this work?

**Speaker A:** Well, it does, so long as you have presence of mind. It only works when the mind goes back into hindrance of, oh my gosh, there's work to do. But when you can maintain a state of joy, then the world becomes a toy. When your mind is full of joy, the world becomes a toy, and now you just go play. But we have to get our mind in that state of joy and get able to maintain it, because oftentimes we forget that the world is a toy and we begin to think it's real, especially when it tries really hard to make you understand that it's real.

**Speaker B:** I have a weird question.

**Speaker A:** But you can do everything as a toy. Everything can be done joyfully.

**Speaker B:** Is this kind of— I might be putting religion into this, but I don't need to. But like, this is what the Brahmins believe, like the world is a dream or something.

**Speaker A:** The Brahmins believe what?

**Speaker B:** That the world is a dream.

**Speaker A:** Okay. That's a way of saying, or a way of stating and pointing to the actual fact, the actual dream. If we define dreaming and the word dream more correctly, most people think of the word dream as merely night dreams without recognizing that most of the time, ere the fourth grade teacher kept telling Johnny to stop daydreaming, Johnny is continuing to daydream the rest of his life. And if there's anything— he and many of the other kids in the room continuously are daydreaming. Okay, so now the Brahmins are pointing in the right direction that most people don't live in reality, they live in their own manufactured mental state that can be rightly called a dream state, daydreaming. Thinking about something else rather than what the teacher is pointing out on the blackboard. He's not paying attention. His mind is scattered. He's off someplace else. Okay, literally thinking about the past, thinking about the future, thinking about what's out the window, thinking about what's out the window, across the street, down the block, over the hill, and miles and miles away from here is all daydreaming. Almost all of human thought is daydreaming, except that in that regard it's because we keep running into fearful things in our dreams. Perhaps we should call them daymares. Daymare, which is in fact a nightmare in a daydream. And that that's in fact what happens with most of the people who are doing stuff on Wall Street, is they go from one moment of nightmare to the next, and it's all in their mind, not paying attention to what's really going on. Which really was going on is that I feel really bad, I'm having a dark night of the soul while I'm having daymares. In fact, it's the dark day of the soul, and it's all a dream, it's all daydreams. And the Buddha understood the mechanism completely of exactly how we do that. And so we can spend at least a few minutes on introduction to Paticcasamuppada. This is the teaching of Paticcasamuppada, and the best way to understand it is, is how it's the Buddha's method of describing how the mind works, state by state, step by step, that leads from an observation of an object out there into feeling bad about it, to where the feeling bad about it had nothing to do with the actual object out there, because everybody that sees that object doesn't feel that way. Why do some people feel one way about what's out there and other people feel another way? Right, because some of them are having one kind of daydream and the other one are having another kind of daymare. But it's all a dream. The reality of it is, is that we're not sure. We need to go investigate things further. Or a better way of looking at it is forget all about it. It's not my business. I don't care. So this is where we're going with this, is that the whole idea of the practice of Anapanasati is to wake up and start living our lives in reality rather than living in a dream state, because often the dream state that we're in is far from reality. But if we are awake, we're much closer to reality. And that would be actually an easy working definition of Dukkha. Then what is Dukkha? Is that when a human being's dream state is far, far from reality, that means that it is more and more subject to Dukkha. And when the mind is closer and closer to reality, and see things the way things really are, then the less likely he will experience Dukkha or suffering from it.

**Speaker B:** And is that because the way things

**Speaker A:** are, everything is fine? Well, that's because we keep going around thinking everything is not fine, where in fact everything is fine. I've heard some people say it like this, that it's a lot of work to fix Dukkha. And that's completely the wrong attitude about it. Dukkha is to be avoided, not repaired. Dukkha is to be merely avoided. You step out of the way. There is in fact in the Dhammapada a famous quote that says, "To avoid evil, to do good, and to purify the mind. That's the quote of the Buddha. Now, what we mean by that is that in Western culture, we have the idea that if we find evil, we've got to trounce on it, poke it in the eye, bust it in the gut, knock a tooth out, blind it, do anything we can to harm it. But we don't recognize that in fact evil is very much like an Anagami,

**Speaker B:** A tar— a what?

**Speaker A:** A tar baby. You know, they put tar on the road, they mix it with sand and make asphalt out of it. Tar is the sludgiest sludge of— I know that's what the manufacturer of

**Speaker B:** petroleum— a tar baby is before the tar gets made.

**Speaker A:** So a tar baby is in fact taking a bunch of tar and fashioning it into a baby. It's a story about this. In fact, it comes out of the— it actually comes out of a tale called the Songs of the South, and it's about the United States, the South in the United States, and during slavery times. And this was written by, or is known by, Uncle Remus, Uncle Remus Tales. And it's a book, and it's in the dialogue of the South. Yeah, very, very heavy accented Southern accent of 100 years, 150 years ago. 170 years. OK, so anyway, the story is about Brer Bear, Brer Fox, and Brer Rabbit. Now, Brer Bear is kind of dumb, but he's a muscle man, and Brer Fox is wily, and Brer Rabbit is the hero or the star of the show. And so Bear Fox and Bear Rabbit get the idea that they're going to make a tar baby and set it aside the road and wait to see what Br'er Rabbit does with the Tar Baby. Well, Br'er Rabbit comes hopping down the trail and he sees the Tar Baby and he says, "How's y'all?" And the Tar Baby don't respond. And so he goes up and approaches and tries to get a conversation going. The Tar Baby just sits there, don't say nothing. And Br'er Rabbit gets hot and angry and hopping mad and jumping up and down, and finally he pokes that tar baby with his fist and he gets the fist stuck in it. And then he takes his other fist and he gets that stuck in it, and then he kicks it with his foot and he gets that stuck, and he kicks it with the other, and now he's just all balled up with this tar baby. Okay, that's exactly what we do when we try to fix things that are broken, is we wind up entangled with the problem. Okay, and I can give you many examples of people getting frustrated, for instance, of untangling fish line, and finally throw it out because they can't do it, it's too much work. Too tedious, spent too much time, frustration, and finally they give up in failure. And they could have just snipped the line without spending all of that time. So that's the way that we treat the world. We treat the world as a tar baby, something that needs to be fixed. And we see even the Dukkha within our own mind is like a tar baby that needs to be fixed. And all we do is get balled up in it again. So it is not too much work to fix Dukkha. Dukkha is not to be fixed, it's to be avoided in this mind moment. Just throw it out right now. Throw out those unwholesome thoughts. It's very easy to do, is just remember. And so this is why we set it aside 4, 5, 6 times a day. Is to practice so that we really know how good it can feel to just sit here with nothing to do and no place to go. And it feels really great to just sit here with no place to go and nothing to do, and everything is all right, everything is fine, no worries. And if we do that 4 or 5 times, 6 times a day, we begin to feel that way more often. And then, like I said, the world becomes a toy to play with rather than a tar baby to

**Speaker B:** fix. The world becomes your oyster.

**Speaker A:** Right, the whole world becomes joyful. There's no problems out there at all. All we have is just people who want to be friends. So this is a way of looking at it. If we think of meditation as something that needs to be done to get a goal fulfilled later, then it's just ordinary. That would be ordinary right view. Wrong view would be, oh, what's the point? Oh, what's the use? Okay, I don't see any value out of it. And so there's where sloth and torpor come in as an attitude based upon the doubt that I can get this stone of Sisyphus up the hill or not. Okay, this is basically— so it is really a victim's, loser's attitude that often has rebellion built into it. And so now they rebel, but they don't rebel against their own stupidity; they rebel against the authorities. And you know who the authority is? The guy who owns that rock that Sisyphus is pushing up the hill, at least in the mind of Sisyphus here. Just let go. Some says if this is just not going to care, because what's the point? I'll never get it up there. I'm a failure anyway. So that's one way. The other way, the ordinary right view is, um, in all of this horseshit, there's got to be a pony someplace.

**Speaker B:** So that would be delayed gratification, right?

**Speaker A:** Delayed gratification. And the noble view is to look at what you're doing. Come out of your misery right now. Be happy right now. Being miserable right now is not going to make you less miserable later. It's going to get you in the habit so that later you'll be even better at being miserable. You're practicing. If you practice misery right now, you'll be even more miserable later. A lot of people say, "Oh, if I'm miserable now, I'll be better off later." This is in fact why people practice austerity. This is why people go to the gym, for delayed gratification, and it almost always winds up backfiring. Practicing misery will just get you more misery. It may get you a lot of muscles, but it will make you less miserable. That's the way of thinking about it now, is that we practice Anapanasati because that's the only new skill to develop of coming out of misery of the mind, to come out of the unwholesome thoughts. That make us miserable and start having wholesome thoughts that are joyous and happy. So when you have thoughts of, "You ought to go meditate," you see, you're making yourself miserable, and then you come back with, "I don't want to meditate," and now everybody's miserable inside. And so I'm back to doing it. So we've covered one side of your question there and also been toying with the other side of the question that you were saying that then there is the issue of rather than meditating, why don't you just go do what you want to do? And then you panned it on me and said, because that's what you said to do. And that's not what I said to do. Wanting things is Tanha. Okay, wanting to do something means that it's got to be done, it's work to do, it's grasping and clinging, rather than looking at it like a toy. I see. It's a toy to play with. You can do it because you like it. And now you're saying, well, I only want to do what I like to do. I can say okay like that. But you didn't say that, you said want. Liking is Vedana, wanting is Tanha. Notice the difference. One is just merely liking. I can like it and I'm good. OK, I can see a new product, a billboard for a brand new cell phone or a brand new 5G, this, that, whippadoo, laddak thing. And I can say, that's nice, I like that. But that's a completely different attitude of looking at it and saying, "Gosh, I've got to have that! Where do I find a store that's got that? How much is it going to set me back? Do I have the money for it? Gosh, this is a lot of worry to get that thing." And now we go down into Tanha, that's Tanha, wanting something that we don't have, as opposed to enjoying what we're doing in the moment. But oftentimes people are doing something, but they're not doing it and enjoying it in the moment they're doing it while they're thinking about some problem they've got. And so they wind up doing it half-heartedly, ignorantly, and maybe with flaws, while at the same time they're

**Speaker B:** miserable.

**Speaker A:** And guess what? Then they blame it on the job. Instead of recognizing that it's all in the mind. So going back to that statement that you made, in fact, is that what we want then is still part of that dream world that we were talking about earlier, tying that back into it. We don't have what we want, that you've already got everything that you need, and everything is good enough as it is. And the only thing that there is left to do is to enjoy and play with whatever comes up. So like for me, visas every 3 months, all kinds of things, vaccinations, many, many different possibilities of things to come up. Then it either be a drudgery and a a bad thing to do, spending hours online, or it can be completely

**Speaker B:** joyful. You can meditate.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you can meditate, and you can giggle and laugh and tell all your jokes to all of the people you've never met before in line. You can have a sing-along. There's all kinds of things that we can do while we're standing in line if that's what needs to be done. But most people stand in line and they're unhappy and miserable. Others are standing in line and talking to others and they're not worried too much about standing in line. But the ones who are not talking, they're mostly miserable. So there's all kinds of possibilities. But rather than thinking about meditating versus not meditating as the object, a much better way of talking about it would be wholesome activities versus unwholesome activities. Because everybody standing in line is going to be miserable, that's what lines are for, is delayed gratification. That's the very issue for it. You get in line so that you can get to the front of the line. And what a joy that is! Every line that you've ever gotten in front of, that's joyful. Finally, you're out of the Dukkha, the line you were in. Why does it have to be Dukkha? Why can't it be joyful while we're still in

**Speaker B:** line? Why can't destinations be joyful?

**Speaker A:** Well, the answer is most of the people are in the dream of love, lines are bad, queues are bad. Nobody likes to stand in line. Why is that? Because they tell themselves that they don't want to stand in line. It's a miserable place to be, and they're going to prove it. But you see, the reality is, is that the line itself has nothing to do with unhappiness or happiness. The line itself is absolutely neutral. The unhappiness of having to stand in line is all mental, so it's a dream.

**Speaker B:** So there is a dream and then

**Speaker A:** there is reality, and then there is a reality. The reality is the queue is a queue, a line is a line, and the dream is, is that everybody's unhappy in line. Shakespeare said, "All the world's a play and everyone is an actor." I would go so far as to say, yes, everyone is an actor on the stage of life, and all the world's a stage, and everyone is standing there reading their own script. Everyone has a script to read. What is the script we're reading? The superego. All that stored information from our past. We're reading a script and we don't even recognize that everybody else is on stage and everybody else is reading their script and no one is looking at the play. Everybody is in their own dream and nobody's looking at the whole stage. But we can, we can set the, the, uh, the script down and take a look at what's going on. And when we took a look at what's going on, we realized that, hey, there's an awful lot of empty seats in the audience. In fact, the audience is completely empty because all of the people are on stage. So we can go sit in the audience and get a nice comfortable chair and just hang out and watch the show. And again, we see it as a playful thing. It's a play, it's a stage play, and everyone's an actor on stage. But we have to keep remembering that because sometimes we get into the, into the delusion or the dream that this is real. What is real? This script that I'm reading, this part that I'm playing, the part that other people are playing, etc., is all real. That's not the reality. The reality is that I'm reading a script, and he's reading a script, and the other guy's reading a script. That's the reality of it, not the content of the script, but the fact that all he's doing is reading a script. That's the reality of it. We're just regurgitating all of the old stuff in our own mind, all of the past. And we have a choice of coming out of that and being in the reality, but we have to keep remembering that. We have to keep digging that hole because the sand keeps falling in, just blown in. Okay, so the hindrances are— we can also say that instead of an analogy, we can say that that neurons in the brain build pathways depending upon usage. The Mahayana stuff, yeah, they're just like highways. Some highways or some roads have very, very little traffic, and so they're very poorly maintained. Often they're not very wide. But when a highway has a whole lot of traffic, then it's going to be like a major structure, a freeway, many lanes, well maintained, well-guarded, that kind of thing. That also exists inside the mind, which means if we start in the mind taking the pathways and the roads that we don't normally take in the mind, they will actually gain strength and the big highways will become neglected. Neurotoxicity. And over time, the highways that used to be the major way that we thought We don't think that way anymore. Those highways don't exist anymore. They've been closed for repair permanently. And so this is a way of thinking, but we have to actually get off of that highway and get on to those byways. And in this regard, We're talking about we have to get off the highway to hell and get onto the path that don't lead nowhere. Got no destination. We're just enjoying the journey, just enjoying the trip.

**Speaker B:** The highway that is heaven.

**Speaker A:** The highway that is heaven, exactly. So this is it. You have to keep practicing and practicing and practicing, but every time you practice you're getting the immediate benefit out of it. It's like, you remember, are you going to be in heaven or are you going to be in hell? And so forget about wanting

**Speaker B:** things.

**Speaker A:** It's like being on the highway to hell wanting to be in heaven. All you have to do is just take the next turn in the next, you know, mental moment, tenth of a second later, and you're on the highway to— you are in heaven. Because you're off the highway to hell. And so this is what we would want, something that we can do immediately. Take that breath. Well, I'm glad I don't have to think about that email. Well, I'm glad I don't have to think about that thesis right now. Well, I don't have to think about that, um, interview that's coming up. I don't have to think about it right now. But it might be a good idea to have some time to think about the interview, but we do so happily knowing that we're prepared for it. So now our thoughts about the interview will become wholesome, but in the beginning we have the thought, wow, I don't have to think about that right now. I can be free from that. That's not a bother. That's like work that I can lay down beside and go to sleep. I'm not afraid of it. So this is a new attitude and a new way of practice, that instead of saying, oh, you ought to meditate, and then you say, no, I don't want to, make a change. As soon as that thought, you ought to meditate, the answer is You're right, I am. Thanks for the

**Speaker B:** reminder. So that's like doing it throughout the day. If you think, 'Oh, to meditate,' and then if you don't have the time, just take like 2 seconds.

**Speaker A:** You just had the second. You had the time. You just spent the time arguing with yourself over you didn't have time to meditate, and that time could have been spent. Okay, so this is the way of practice. You go get that and start enjoying your moment. Remember to enjoy the moment. That's your practice of meditation, is to have wholesome thoughts. Okay, all right, well, we'll see you again later. Thanks.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) in dialogue with a Sangha friend (Speaker B), centers on correcting fundamental misunderstandings about meditation and reframing the practice of **Ānāpānasati** (mindfulness of breathing). Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Themes**

1.  **Meditation vs. Ānāpānasati:** Dhammarato distances the practice from the commonly misused term "meditation." He argues that what is often called meditation (focused, effortful, goal-oriented) is not what is being taught. Instead, the practice is **Ānāpānasati**—using the breath as an anchor to be fully present and cultivate well-being *right now*.

2.  **The Goal is Immediate Sukha (Happiness/Peace):** The practice is not a chore or "work" for delayed gratification. The immediate goal is to experience **Sukkha**—a sense of safety, comfort, satisfaction, and fearlessness in the present moment. The breath is a tool to access this.

3.  **Correcting the "Focus" Misconception:** The practice is explicitly **not** about intense focus or concentration that excludes everything else. It is about **mindfully gathering wholesome factors** (like relaxation, ease, and joy) and becoming familiar with the body and senses through the breath.

4.  **Overcoming the "Sisyphus" Mindset:** A participant relates to the myth of Sisyphus (endlessly pushing a boulder uphill), feeling meditation is a futile struggle. Dhammarato reframes this: each time you "push the boulder" (practice), you build a platform of skill and confidence. The point isn't the struggle but the **joy and confidence gained from knowing you can return to a wholesome state**.

5.  **From Unwholesome to Wholesome Thoughts:** The essence of the practice is **replacing unwholesome thoughts** (e.g., "This is work," "I don't want to," "I'm failing") with **wholesome thoughts** (e.g., "This is nice," "I'm doing it," "Everything is okay right now"). This shift is the direct path to ending mental suffering (Dukkha).

6.  **The World as a Toy, Not a Tar Baby:** Dhammarato uses the Uncle Remus story of the "Tar Baby" to illustrate a crucial point: **Dukkha is to be avoided, not fixed**. Engaging with negative thoughts and trying to "fix" suffering only entangles us further. When the mind is joyful, the "world becomes a toy" to play with, not a problem to solve.

7.  **Waking Up from the Daydream:** Most of our suffering arises from living in a "dream state" or "daymare"—thinking about the past, future, or hypothetical worries. **Ānāpānasati is the practice of waking up to reality**, which is often perfectly fine as it is. Suffering increases the further our mental narrative is from present-moment reality.

8.  **Practical Application Throughout the Day:** Formal sitting practice is like a piano rehearsal—it prepares you for the performance of daily life. The real practice is **remembering to have a wholesome thought at any moment**, especially when you catch yourself in an internal argument (e.g., "I should meditate" vs. "I don't want to"). The correct response is: "You're right, I am [meditating right now by being present]."

### **Conclusion**
The talk is an invitation to completely reframe spiritual practice. It is not a burdensome task for a future reward but a continuous, gentle remembering to **choose wholesome, joyful thoughts anchored in the present moment**. By doing so, we step off the "highway to hell" (unwholesome mental habits) and onto the "path that leads nowhere" (enjoying the journey itself), finding peace and confidence in our immediate experience.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain meditation (Anapanasati) and the mindset needed for practice. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **Digging a Hole in the Desert:** The mind is like a desert. Wholesome states (like peace, satisfaction) are like digging a hole, but sand (unwholesome thoughts, hindrances) constantly falls back in. The practice is to keep digging, appreciating the hole when you have it, and not getting discouraged when it fills up.
2.  **The World as a Toy:** When the mind is joyful, "the world becomes a toy" to play with, not a serious problem to fix or a burden.
3.  **Neural Pathways as Highways:** Unwholesome thought patterns are like well-traveled, multi-lane highways. Wholesome thoughts are like unused back roads. Practice is about choosing the back roads until they become the new, dominant pathways, and the old highways decay from lack of use.
    *   **Sub-metaphor:** "Highway to Hell" vs. "Highway to Heaven." You can instantly switch from a mental "highway to hell" (suffering) to a "highway to heaven" (joy) by changing your thought in a tenth of a second.
4.  **Meditation as "No Place to Go, Nothing to Do":** The ideal state is compared to a Zen poem: "No place to go and nothing to do... the spring comes and the grass grows by itself." It's the goal of every worker to be "done" and at peace now.
5.  **Life as a Stage Play (from Shakespeare):** "All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players." The speaker expands this: everyone is on stage reading their own script (past conditioning, superego). Wisdom is putting the script down, sitting in the audience, and simply watching the play joyfully without getting caught up in the drama.
6.  **The Breath as an Anchor:** The breath is used as an "anchor" to bring you into the present moment.
7.  **The "Hole" vs. "Platform":** In the context of Sisyphus, progress is like getting the stone up the hill and building a better platform to keep it there each time, rather than just watching it roll down.

### **Stories & Analogies**
1.  **Sisyphus:** Used to discuss the hindrance of sloth/doubt ("what's the point?"). The speaker reinterprets it: instead of being doomed to failure, you *can* get the stone (a wholesome state) up the hill. If it rolls down, you build a better foundation and get it up again, gaining confidence each time.
2.  **The Tar Baby (from Uncle Remus Tales):** Represents "evil" or problems (including internal dukkha). The lesson is that trying to "fix" or fight a problem (like Br'er Rabbit punching the tar baby) only gets you more stuck. The wise approach is to avoid entanglement altogether—to "snip the line" of unwholesome thoughts rather than wrestling with them.
3.  **The Teenager Taking Out the Trash:** Illustrates **right effort and motivation**.
    *   **Forced Effort:** The teen takes out the trash because his mom nags him. It feels like hard work.
    *   **Joyful Effort:** The teen takes out the trash proactively to make his mom happy. It feels light and energetic. Meditation should be like the second scenario.
4.  **The Piano Student:** You practice meditation (like practicing a piano piece) at set times so you can perform it well "on recital day"—that is, during the tough moments of daily life.
5.  **Dad's Saying:** "Work? I'm not afraid of work. I can lay down beside it and go to sleep." Used to contrast the attitude of striving and "work" with the attitude of ease and non-doing in correct practice.
6.  **Standing in Line:** A queue is neutral. The misery of waiting is a self-created "dream" or script. One can choose to be joyful while in line instead of fixating on the delayed gratification of reaching the front.

### **Core Conceptual Contrasts (Implied Metaphors)**
*   **Meditation as Work vs. Meditation as Non-Work/Relaxation:** The speaker argues against the Western view of meditation as a strenuous "focus," framing it instead as relaxing into the present.
*   **The Dream State (Daydreaming/Daymaring) vs. Waking Up to Reality:** Most of our thinking is likened to being asleep in a dream (or nightmare), while Anapanasati is about waking up to reality, where things are fundamentally okay.
*   **Delayed Gratification vs. Immediate Gratification:** The common mindset of "I'll suffer now (meditate) to be happy later" is rejected. True practice is finding the gratification (sukkha) **in** the very act of mindful breathing.

**In summary,** the speaker uses metaphors of **construction/excavation** (digging holes, building platforms), **travel** (highways, journeys), **theater** (scripts, stages), and **play** (toys) to shift the listener's perspective from meditation as a grueling task of concentration to an accessible, joyful practice of cultivating wholesome mental states and disentangling from unhelpful thought patterns. The stories of **Sisyphus** and the **Tar Baby** are central to addressing discouragement and the wrong approach to dealing with suffering.
