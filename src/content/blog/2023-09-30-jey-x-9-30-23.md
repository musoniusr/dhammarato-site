### Transcript


**Speaker A:** It'll flash the screen. All right, Jet, well, good to see you again. You said you've got some questions, and so, uh, let's hear what you have to say.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so I have 3 actually. So the first one is kind of like, it's kind of being a lot more grounded in the chaos. Like, you know, sometimes things don't like go your way, or like like how do you just kind of stay a rock within the storm? So what are your, like, your thoughts on that?

**Speaker A:** Well, uh, the important thing to remember that every storm that you ever have is not coming from the outside world, it's coming from the inside. For example, if you were out walking and it starts to rain There's no problem. It just rains. It's rained before, it'll rain again. But, uh, using the word caught in the rain means that you don't like it, that you're not prepared for it. And so the storm then is not the rain, it's that you don't like it. Okay, that's the important point, because there's where the freedom lies, is that every problem that that we've ever had was inside the mind. Let us say that the chair fell over. Well, it fell over, but if we don't like that the chair fell over, now that's the problem. Oh, we got to go put that chair back upright. All right, and that almost always comes from some rule that we have, that we pick up rules when we're children about how things are supposed to be. And then when things are not according to the rules, we don't like it. But the point is, is that it's real. And so here we go around not liking what really is true because it interferes with some sort of rule that we've had. Mm-hmm. Okay, so for instance, if a storm is that somebody is having a lot of trouble, maybe they got arrested or something like that, and you've got to go take care of the situation, you can go take care of that situation happily, or you can go and take care of that situation as if it were a storm that you don't like. Isn't that interesting? So it's a new way of looking at it. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** So it's kind of like it's your choice, like the— I guess things are just kind of blowing up. It's like kind of your choice to whether just kind of like feed into of like, I guess the story, I guess in this case it'd be like the story, like if you're in the story, like, oh, like all this is happening or whatnot, and I don't really like it. Or I can just pretty much be like, this is happening, and I'm just kind of going with the moment.

**Speaker A:** Yes, this is the whole point. Um, one of the words that you used just recently before we turned a recorder on was affirmation. And I want to make sure that you understand that this, what we're practicing here, the practice of the Buddha, is not affirmations. That affirmations, you know, there's a whole lot of self-help books, and those self-help books generally have a section, or maybe the whole book is about affirmations. And so The teenage girl stands in front of the mirror telling herself, "Oh, I'm beautiful. Oh, I'm gorgeous. Oh, they all love me," those kind of affirmations. But then when she leaves the mirror, the whole rest of the day she doesn't practice. The next point is that what she is practicing is not real, because she doesn't believe that she's beautiful and she knows for sure that all those kids at school, especially the bullies, I don't love her. Okay. And so it's good to get the point about affirmations is that we're not actually practicing affirmations because affirmations in general don't work. Generally, in fact, what happens is after somebody reads the book on affirmations and they think about all the wonderful things about it, and if they'd only do that And then after they finish reading the book, they put it back on the shelf and they don't continue to practice. Okay. And so those affirmations at best are short-lived. What we're really talking about here is a whole lifestyle change about the way that we think. And that is not an affirmation also, because what we're actually training the mind to do is to be in reality. And so the things that we want to tell ourselves are actually true. All right, so in one of the ways that we work with it is, um, uh, the Buddha recommends going into seclusion, and he talks about going to the forest, going to a foot of a tree, going to an empty hut or going on to a pile of straw. Those were things that were available 2,500 years ago. But getting into an empty room or an empty hut— what we mean by empty is that there's no other people in the room. So we want to get alone, and because we are alone, the reality in that moment is that we're safe. There's nobody banging on the door. There's no snakes on the floor. There's no crocodiles. There's no Russian mafia crawling through the window. There's no SWAT team breaking in. There's nothing happening. And that's real. And that will help us in the physical world of being real, is now we can have thoughts about that. Oh, I'm safe right now. I am safe. And if we talk about it in that regard, we can begin to feel safe. That's one thing about Western culture, is that it's not safe. Little kids learn that the world is dangerous, and we keep that attitude our whole lives, that it's dangerous out there. And so we always have an underlying feeling of fear and dread can be manifest as anxiety or even panic. And in fact, people who have panic attacks, when they're having a panic attack, they're not in danger. If they were in real danger, they wouldn't be in a panic, they'd be running. So this is one of the points about the difference between the reality, is that we're practicing reality. And so we want to actually be in the reality of being safe so that we can begin to talk to ourselves and allow ourselves to feel safe. Okay, and if we can practice feeling safe, secure, comfortable— that's another thing that's very strange about Western meditation, is that they think that they have to sit on the floor for a long time until the body gets uncomfortable. And the Buddha didn't recommend that. He recommended going and sitting under the tree because it was a comfortable thing to do. So sitting in a chair or anything like that that's comfortable We're looking for that comfort, the reality of being comfortable. Because when the body is in pain, the word pain itself actually is a mental state. That the body itself is not really in pain, it gives sensations. It might be a sharp sensation, or a dull sensation, or a heavy sensation, or a hot sensation, but it's just a sensation, and we call it pain because we don't like it. So an example would be that the kid has gotten a broken arm and it's in a cast, and it's been in the cast for a few days, maybe a week or so, and it itches. Now, one of the things that's really interesting about an arm that's broken, that's in a cast, it itches, and the itching is the healing. And the kid doesn't like it, and so he's moving the arm around trying to get it comfortable, and that actually is interfering with the healing. If the kid can say, oh, it's itching because it's feeling, it's healing, let me hold that hand still. That generally what happens when kids get a broken arm They continue, especially if it's the right arm, they'll continue to use that hand. They'll pick up cups, they'll try to write, they'll use it when they're— anytime that they need to use the hand, they won't remember. And this is why the doctors will often put the arm in a sling to hold the arm still. And yet the kid will take that sling and move his arm around and use his hand. Okay, and then the hand— it— or then the arm itches. So the whole point then is if the arm is broken, we need to let it heal. That means that we stop moving the hand. All right, so the same thing then is true, is that we want to actually put the mind in a kind of a cast so that it doesn't go where very much and gives it a chance to heal. Okay, so the cast that we put the mind in is the reality is that we're safe, and yet we don't feel safe because we're in the habit of not feeling safe. So let's get into the position to where in reality we are safe, and then we can see that, we can recognize it. Oh, I am safe. Right now. So if we have the idea or the, the, uh, the words, the wholesome thoughts, and the reality working together, then that safety, security, and comfort can then grow into satisfaction that everything actually is okay right now. Wow, this is nice. 'Well, I can relax.' We can begin to feel good in a way that we've never felt good before, because we've been doing affirmations, or we've been doing work, or we've been trying to fix problems, or we don't like the itch and all of this. And this is actually the teaching of the Buddha, is to put the mind in a wholesome state. And it really helps if the body is also in a wholesome state. And so this is not affirmations, this is actually practicing being real.

**Speaker B:** Okay, that makes complete sense.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that's it, to be in real. Now, uh, let us say in, in school The situation is that the 14-year-old kid is an underclassman, he's not fully in high school yet, and yet he's in the 9th grade. So he's in high school, and there the high school bullies are. Very, very rarely, and only in certain situations, is the bully actually dangerous. Dangerous, but the kid thinks that the bully is dangerous, and because of that, he's full of fear. Well, guess what? Bullies know that. They pick on the ones that are afraid. They don't pick on the big guys. They pick on the kids that are afraid of them, and so that fear will show. The way that we speak, the way that we stand, and all of that indicates the fear. Another example of that is that dogs, they bark at people who are afraid.

**Speaker B:** I had that experience.

**Speaker A:** They don't bark at people who are friendly to the dogs. If the dog— if the person is friendly and comes up and shows him the hand and whatnot like that and is not afraid of the dog then the dog will act kindly too. So in the case of the bully, if you see a bully coming down the hall towards you, the right solution is to walk fast right in his direction and right past him, as if he was not important to you at all. And if he calls and says, hey, stop, or something, calls out your name, The right answer is to say, "Oh, I've got to go," and you turn to say that, but you don't even stop moving. You just keep walking. You get away from it. In fact, this is a fairly important technique to learn, and that is that when we are in a dangerous situation, the right thing to do is to leave, to walk away. Or like in the song The Gambler, know when to walk away and know when to run. But we normally, if you're wise, we almost never have to run. I would say that the running in that sense of the mental running means that you intently do not want to stay in this dangerous situation. And so, right from the very beginning, we practice being safe, feeling safe. In fact, fear is generally the underlying condition for all negative feelings. When you have grief because someone's died, it almost always has an element of fear, as in, "What am I going to do without her?" Like, what's become— what will become of my arm when it's broken? Well, if you keep moving it, it's going to heal slowly, and if you let it rest, it's going to heal quickly. But we get worried about, is it going to heal? We get worried about what's going to happen in the future, and so we perpetuate this fear, anxiety, Fear, panic, all of that kind of stuff is all based in fear. And so a good life is going to be lived when you're free from fear. And so we have to practice being not afraid. Hey, this is good right now. Hey, I like it right now. This is good enough. And when we practice that way, we begin to change our attitude about the world. And the attitude change that comes about is the attitude of being a winner, the attitude of, "Hey, I can handle this. I can handle anything. It doesn't matter what the problem is, I can do it." Got no troubles, got no problems. This is the kind of attitude. Everything's going to be all right. Everything is fine. In fact, there's a Zen koan that really fits this, and the Zen koan is: nothing to do, no place to go. The spring comes and the grass grows all by itself. We don't have to do anything for the grass. It's going to grow all by itself. Doesn't need our help. So this is the kind of lifestyle that we begin to have. The Zen masters will often tell their students, you're already enlightened. A lot of people in Buddhism, they want enlightenment instead of recognizing that what they are right now is already enlightened. As long as they're not heavy. All we have to do is stop being heavy, and then we're light, we're enlightened. And the next point that is valuable for you is that our whole society is built upon— the word is incrementalism. And what that means is taking steps to get someplace. Like for instance, a pilgrim is on a pilgrimage, which means he's out traveling, going to a holy site. But the reality is, is that wherever you are, that's a holy place. You've already arrived. There's no place to go. And yet people are out traveling. That's that incrementalism. We're on the way to someplace. And what we're practicing here is the practice of, you've already arrived. You've already arrived. This is it. This is good enough. Does that make sense? Yeah, if we stop traveling and just experience that we're all— we're already there, we're already enlightened, this is cool enough. This is good enough. And so this is the real practice, the practice of, "Oh, I'm already safe enough. Oh, I'm already comfortable enough. Oh, I'm already satisfied enough." That in fact, this is an important point, it's to the point of, it's the entire teachings of the Buddha, which I talked to you before about the Four Noble Truths and the the whole package wrapped together into one statement: Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Well, the word Dukkha means dissatisfaction. So if we can get into a state of satisfaction, that's all there is to the teaching of the Buddha. And yet in Western mentality, because of all of the incrementalism, going higher and higher and higher and higher and higher, The high place is always way far away from us, trying to get better and better, and for that reason, things like enlightenment are way out there someplace. Very few, if anybody, ever gets to that place, right? That's the idea. But that's not the teaching of the Buddha at all. The teaching of the Buddha is to remember that you're already enlightened. This is it. No place to go, nothing to do. Everything is already okay. And that's the reality of it, because, Jet, right now, already, you're okay. You're fine. You got no problems other than the ones that you make up.

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker A:** You'Re already okay. But we have to practice since, because we have all of these memories and all of these rules about what you should be and that you're not. And so we give ourselves tasks to do rather than enjoying what's happening right now.

**Speaker B:** But I guess I got— yeah, I guess kind of like another question too. So because it's actually— so how can you like, I guess, not bring like the, I guess, the past or like the future into the present? Because there's been times where I brought something from the past And the moment I'm having, I guess, like, I guess the moment I'm having, the current moment is going good. And then I bring in like the past experience or like sometimes the future and it makes it kind of like, I don't know, like, I don't know, it kind of like repeats like, like Arahant ends up being negative. I mean, articulate it better.

**Speaker A:** Yes, our past is often filled with negatives. Our past is filled with the perception of failure. The reality is, is that whatever happened in the past, no matter what happened in the past, you're still here. So the past, whatever it was, didn't kill you. Here you are. If that's the case, then whatever was in the past was not all of that important because it didn't kill you. And if it did kill you and it was important and it did kill you, now you've got no problems at all because you're already dead. So in that regard, the past is not real. It's done with, it's gone, and all we have is memories of it and the rules of, oh, it should not have changed, it should have stayed the same. That laptop, when we bought it 5 years ago, was completely functional. It did everything it was supposed to do. So why is it that I'm dissatisfied with it now? Well, times have changed, things have changed, it doesn't have the power, it doesn't have the memory, etc., like that is all in our minds. The fact is that the laptop probably is the same as it was 5 years ago. So, this is the point, is that we have to start practicing reality. The reality is that everything's all right, everything is fine.

**Speaker B:** So how do you do that? I guess kind of just get used.

**Speaker A:** To the way that I was saying was, number one, get ourselves comfortable, and then number two, talk about ourselves being comfortable. Get ourselves in a safe situation and then talk to ourselves about feeling safe, feeling safe, being secure. And that leads into the feeling of everything's okay, satisfaction. The whole point about what life is about is, is that it goes from one dissatisfaction to another dissatisfaction. I don't like this, I don't like that, I want this to be different, I want that to be different. And we live our lives like that, being in the state of going from one dissatisfaction to the next. And we've gotten into quite a habit of it. And not only that, but everybody around us also has that habit. And because everybody's got that habit, we think that it's normal. Well, in fact, because everybody's got it, it would be normal, but it's certainly not natural. Our society makes our people uptight, that it would be far better for us to be completely relaxed in the jungle, which actually has its own dangers, but in the jungle we can handle things quite well. It's when we get into the concrete jungle that things get tense for everybody, and everybody's afraid And everybody is uptight, and that seems normal. But our job with the Dhamma is to start practicing that everything's already okay, that we're not in danger. The reality is, in the room that you're in right now, you're not in danger. What a relief it is. To not be afraid, to feel like that you can handle anything. This is actually built right into the Eightfold Noble Path of the Buddha, in the sense of to wake up means to come into the present moment, to stop thinking about the past and stop thinking about the future and stop thinking about things way over there and just have the thoughts of right here, right now, everything is marvelous, everything is okay, not a worry in the world. And so we need to practice that over and over and over again, because how many 10,000 times have you thought about something to do? Oh, I've got to go do it. Oh, if I don't do it, something terrible is going to happen, right? And so that fear comes up. And so most of human activity is activity based in fear. We're trying to get something so that we'll feel better, or we're trying to get rid of something so that we'll feel better, instead of just feeling better. So this is what this practice is all about, is about sitting down and feeling good. Okay, okay. It's not affirmations, because affirmations, when people are doing the affirmations, they don't, they don't feel good. The practice that we're having here is we feel good. We threw— we throw all of those affirmations, including all the unwholesome ones, out and just say Everything right now is all right. Everything's good.

**Speaker B:** So basically just kind of, I guess, just kind of remind yourself that I'm already pretty much safe and everything's good. And I guess when I fall in that headspace, it's like kind of do like a reality check, like everything's good at this moment.

**Speaker A:** So it's just Yeah, yeah, keep doing that reality check. Today things are not bad right this very moment. So we get into that feeling state of everything's okay right now, because most of the time things are okay right now. And when you get that attitude completely built in, then when things are not okay right now, in reality we can still handle it. Easily. All right, that's the practice, is to get into a state that you— and get into it often— where you feel safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. And then the thoughts will come: hot dog, I can do this, I can do it, I can feel safe, I can feel secure, I can feel satisfied. And that's what gives us that winner's attitude, that you are a winner, because you can handle anything. So you said you had several questions. I think that I might have answered all of them already. Got one more.

**Speaker B:** You answered two of them. Also, I guess sometimes where I kind of go in like deep thought or I'm just kind of just going on a walk or something like that, I guess kind of trusting your intuition more. You got any stuff on that?

**Speaker A:** All right, let's talk about intuition. Intuition is of two different types, completely different from one another, almost opposites. One is the normal intuition that people use, and that is they go by their old habits, they go by their instinct. Instincts and intuitions are the same thing, basically. Now, the important thing is that instincts were what animals used way back when, and that humans, as they became human, they didn't stop being animals. In fact, you could say that the instincts that we have are built right down into our DNA. And so, when we respond instinctively to something, that means that we're responding with a really, really old program. That program is perhaps hundreds of years old, and it's passed down from generation to generation. An example of that would be domestic violence. That the kid gets beat up by his dad, and so when he gets angry, he instinctively hits his kid too. And so the domestic violence is passed down generation after generation after generation. So there's another way of developing instincts, and then this would be called wisdom. In other words, we begin now to investigate, to look, to hold back, to stop, and to gain more information so that we'll know what to do. And that's an entirely different kind of instinct, okay? The instinct about what's happening in the immediate future. All right, the example that I use comes from my childhood when I was a teenager. Going out on the hunt. There was a guy, an old man, who had a double-barreled 12-gauge shotgun that he was out there with, and he had it resting over his left arm with the butt of the gun, the stock, he had under his arm. And here he is walking around And the gun was pointed not straight down, but was pointed downward at an angle so that all the people who were around him, that gun was moving back and forth across their knees. Okay, everyone there knew that where a gun is pointed is where the bullet will go. This is the kind of wisdom. If you can see which way the gun is pointed, you know which way the bullet's going to go. They are— I've heard, I haven't been to a gun range in my whole life, never been to one, but I have heard from students that the same thing is exactly true at a gun range, that everybody must be careful about where their gun is pointed. Because it can go off, and if it does, the bullet's going to go where the gun's pointed. Okay, so, uh, this is why people will shoulder— or let us say, um, not shoulder the weapon, but holster, put it in a holster so that it points down so that the gun is less likely to harm anybody. You don't want to point the guns up because if it goes off, then that bullet's going to go who knows where, doing what kind of damage. Okay, so this is wisdom, is to start watching how things are going, because any way that things are pointed, that's where it's going to go off. This is what now we are calling a brand new kind of intuition. It's based upon wisdom, not based upon instincts or upon the way that everybody else thinks. And now this can be trained. One of the things that happened to me was my teacher, Ajahn Po, and he did this, oh, I don't know, maybe 10 or 12 different times over the years. He would come to my kuti, come to my little hut, and stand in the yard. Didn't clear his throat, didn't make a noise, didn't do anything. He would just stand there, and eventually I would come out. And then later I began to have a sense of he's there, and I have that sense now, so that when somebody is coming into the yard, that damn my wife, when she's on the road, I can sense it. This is called clairvoyance, but that clairvoyance really has a whole lot to do with what you can see right now. So if I'm talking to a student and they just stare at me, that's a different response than if they're nodding up and down or if they're smiling. And so, this is the intuition, means that we're actually observing, we're looking, we're testing. This is what real intuition is, when it's wise intuition, rather than going from our past, and going from our deep past, the instincts. So that intuition can be developed. How do we develop it? By remembering to be here now and to look. Look at those guns, because people got their guns out all the time, their mental guns. So we need to learn how they're pointed. This is basically the study of psychology, and the best psychology is observation. You can observe, you can look, but that requires being in the present moment. Rather than remembering what somebody was like last time, you treat them as something brand new right now.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay, yeah, yeah, that makes complete sense. Oh man, yeah, I don't got no words.

**Speaker A:** It's crazy.

**Speaker B:** Oh my gosh.

**Speaker A:** Yes, this is what we call insight. What you're going through right now is hot damn, I didn't think of it that way before. And this is real. The future is not real. The past is not real. What's happening right now is real. Let's pay attention right now to what's going on. Because that's what's real. And if we're watching and observing what's happening right now, then we can respond. I got a joke about this. This happened on Saturday Night Live, and they did this over a sequence of weeks. And what they were doing was they were having an interview with someone And during the interview, when the person was getting all excited about what they were talking about, somebody from the set would throw a great big lightweight plastic fish. And the funny thing was, is that almost all the women would get hit smack in the face with that fish, that many of the guys would kind of bat it down, or they would kind of protect themselves because they had a little bit. And then they had a Heisman Trophy winner, and they got his attention on this thing over here and then threw that fish at him from the side, and he just picked it right up out of the air.

**Speaker B:** Whoa.

**Speaker A:** Why was that? Just because he's here now. He saw that thing and he grabbed it, but he had been trained That's what sports will do for a lot of people. In fact, sportsmen and martial artists make really, really good Dhamma students because they've already been training themselves into being in the here-now so much of the time. And so now all we have to do is to start recognizing that the be here now doesn't have to be active like on the sports field. A sport field or in a fight, but that we could be aware in the reality of the moment, to be here now, and our whole lives get better. That those slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, the insults and whatnot, they don't hit us. That we grab them things right out of the air. That's the wisdom. Okay, and it can be in the sense of what we would call reflexes, but it is not reflexes so much because we often reflex badly. We act intuitively, instinctively. So when somebody yells at us, we instinctively get angry. So it takes some practice that when somebody yells at us, when somebody's angry, Can I maintain that position of, just because he yelled, he didn't hurt me? He can't touch me. He can't touch me. I can handle anything. And so this is where we begin to get a new kind of an instinct, and that new kind of instinct is based upon the point, is I can handle anything. If I remember. And this is why we have to practice remembering, to practice being in the here now, because so much of the time we're either in the past or in the future, or the mind is off someplace else, not real. And so that then, if, if we're all in someplace else, if we're caught up in our conversation and that fish comes flying at us We don't have the ability to pick it up out of the air, but if we're practiced, if we're in the here now, then when those fish start to fly, we can grab them right out of the air.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so yeah, I guess kind of— yeah, I guess I guess when you're doing something, I guess remembering the past, I guess when things are starting to become a little bit challenging, just instead of remembering the past, kind of just remember you're in the moment. So just kind of reinforce that.

**Speaker A:** Come back to this present moment because almost always we're not really in danger. And if there is danger, it's because we're asleep to it. We don't see it. Because we don't see it, it hits us, then we're afraid.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the fist.

**Speaker A:** But if we can see it coming, we can dodge it. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** So that's what intuition is. The intuition is to be here now, to see what's going on, so that we can respond happily, easily, decisively, because we're the winner, because we're here now. And like I said, we have to practice this. And in fact, one of the little jokes is, is that every shampoo bottle that's sold in the grocery store or in 7-Eleven, every shampoo bottle has the teaching of the Buddha right there on the label or on the back of the bottle. The people say, how can that be? And the answer to that is every shampoo bottle has the statement rinse and repeat. Rinse and repeat. And that's what we're doing here. We're cleaning out the mind, we're rinsing it out, and then we're going to rinse it out again. Rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat. Clean out the mind, be here now, and then clean it out later, be here now. Another joke that I like to tell from time to time is that we need to change our mind more often than we change our underwear.

**Speaker B:** Underwear.

**Speaker A:** A lot more often. Sorry, what was that? Because the mind's likely to get dirty more often than our underwear is.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** So this is the practice. Rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat. Change that mind, come back to the present moment, over and over and over again. And so this needs to be practiced several times a day, many times a day. I would recommend the first thing that you do when you wake up in the morning is to practice this in the sense of, wow, I'm awake. Wow, everything's all right. Everything's going to be okay. What a nice day this is going to be. And yet many people, when they get up, they get up feeling tired, saying, oh, I'm still tired. Oh, I don't want to go to work. Oh, poor me. And so we can practice before we even get out of bed. We can practice, hot dog, I'm still alive. I didn't die in the night. 'Here I am. I'm still awake. I'm still alive. I'm still breathing. Isn't this marvelous? Today is just another day, and I can handle it just fine.' And then when we go to bed at night, we can also do this by saying, 'Oh, no place to go and nothing to do.' The bed is comfortable, and I can just lay here and enjoy the night. And by cleaning the mind out, then we can go to sleep easily and almost never have any dreams much. People who have dreams are because they were smoking. Their mind was spinning, it was burning when they were going to sleep, and so the mind continues to burn and smoke all night. In the dream state. But if we can go to sleep with a happy thought of nothing to do and no place to go, and I'm just laying here and everything is marvelous, then we can easily go to sleep. And then we can practice at lunchtime, we can practice at break, we can even stop what we're doing if we're sitting at the desk in the office. We can just stop and say Hey, right now I'm going to take a 5-minute break and I've got nothing to do and no place to go and everything is really easy. No dangers, no worries, everything is cool. Because normally the kind of thoughts we have is, oh, I've got to do this and things are not cool and I've got to fix this and I got to change that. And so that's the lifestyle that we've gotten ourselves into, a busy, busy, busy, busy. And we're now going to practice no busy. Not right now, I'm not busy, I'm relaxed. Take a, take a rest, take a deep breath. And so this needs to be practiced. Throughout the day, and pretty soon it will begin to connect, and you'll remember instantly, or you'll have the thought, 'Oh, I can just relax right now.' An example of that is waiting. People don't like to wait. Have you seen people fidget and whatnot? So imagine that you're going into the bank, you've got to get some business done, and the bank is full of people. And you gotta wait, you gotta wait, and you gotta wait, and you gotta wait. And you get into a kind of a grumpy mood. All right, but if we can remember, hey, I got no place to go, let me sit here and just enjoy the moment. Wow, the bank even has air conditioning, isn't this nice? So I can stand here, I can sit here, and everything is hunky-dory. So that's the way that we practice. We practice over and over, rinse and repeat. Just throw all of the stuff about the bank out of the mind and just say, I'll take care of it when there's a teller available. Right now I'm just going to sit here and enjoy being in the bank with no place to go, nothing good too.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so I guess it's just constantly reminding yourself it's— things are, things are pretty much good. Yeah, things are good.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, things are good. Yeah, your life is really good. If you would, if you would appreciate it, it would get even better. Yeah, man.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's like, I guess, I guess like 80% of the thoughts is either like the past or the future. So I didn't really— I guess I'm so blind to like, I guess like the moment or just kind of like the present moment. I just kind of neglect that most, most times.

**Speaker A:** We neglect to see how things are, and they're good enough. Always got these rules and these ideas that things should be better than this, and things should be getting better than this. That's that incrementalism, that we're always in a journey, always going someplace, and never figure out that we've arrived. We're already in that holy place. You're whole, you're holy right now. You're in that sacred place right now when we remember that we're here. And so this is what we're practicing— practicing being already arrived, getting that sense of completion. Things are good enough.

**Speaker B:** And it's getting better.

**Speaker A:** Don't have to worry about it getting better. They're already okay. They don't have to get better. This is good enough. Whether they get better or not, I don't care because they're already good enough. But we have to practice that because we're in such a bad habit of things have got to get better for me to be happy. The actual answer to that is, oh no, things are good enough now. I can be happy right now, happy and satisfied, joyful even. So go ahead. That's it.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. But answered all my questions.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, you go have fun. Go enjoy your life. Give me a call in the next several days and we'll continue on with this. It's good for you to come back to get this reminder, as well as there's a bit more to be said. But go and practice getting yourself into state. I'm okay, I'm good. I got this wired. No worries, I can handle this. Those— that's the state of mind that we can get into and have a marvelous life.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'll do that. I will do that.

**Speaker A:** So, all right, thank you.

**Speaker B:** Appreciate it. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yes, we'll see you soon.

**Speaker B:** For sure. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** All right, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) in dialogue with a student named Jet (Speaker B), focuses on **cultivating unshakable peace and satisfaction by grounding oneself in the present reality, rather than in stories, rules, or affirmations.**

Here is a concise summary of the core teachings:

### **Core Problem: We Create Our Own Storms**
*   The "chaos" or "storm" we experience doesn't come from external events (rain, a fallen chair, a problem), but from our **internal resistance** to those events—our dislike, our rules about how things "should" be, and our fear.
*   We live in a state of **dissatisfaction (dukkha)**, constantly moving from one problem to the next, believing this is normal.

### **The Solution: Practice Reality, Not Affirmations**
*   This is **not** about positive affirmations (e.g., "I'm beautiful") which are often untrue and short-lived. Instead, it's a **lifestyle change** to align your thinking with what is actually, verifiably true *right now*.
*   The practice is to **consciously recognize and dwell in the present reality** that, in this very moment, you are most likely:
    1.  **Safe** (no immediate physical threat)
    2.  **Comfortable** (the body is at ease)
    3.  **Okay** (fundamentally fine)
*   From this foundation, you can cultivate a deep **satisfaction** that "everything is already good enough."

### **Key Practices & Insights**
1.  **"You've Already Arrived":** Stop the mindset of "incrementalism"—the belief that you're on a journey to some future happiness or enlightenment. The teaching is that **you are already whole and "enlightened" right now**; you just need to shed the heaviness of dissatisfaction.
2.  **Anchor in the Present:** Let go of the past (which is gone and didn't kill you) and the future (which is imaginary). When a negative memory or worry arises, do a **"reality check"**: *"Right now, in this moment, am I actually safe and okay?"*
3.  **Develop Wise Intuition:** There are two types of intuition:
    *   **Old Instinct:** Reactive, based on past habits and fears (e.g., lashing out in anger).
    *   **Wise Intuition:** A trained awareness of the present moment, allowing you to see things clearly and respond skillfully—like an athlete catching a ball thrown from the side. This comes from **being "here now."**
4.  **"Rinse and Repeat":** This is a constant practice. You must **"change your mind more often than your underwear."** Regularly pause throughout the day—upon waking, at work, while waiting—to rinse away busy, worried thoughts and return to the baseline truth: *"No place to go, nothing to do. Everything is okay right now."*
5.  **Cultivate a "Winner's Attitude":** By repeatedly practicing this grounded state, you build the confident attitude: **"I can handle anything. I am not a victim of circumstances."** This disarms external "bullies" and internal fear.

### **Practical Takeaways**
*   Start the day by acknowledging: "I'm alive, I'm breathing, today is manageable."
*   End the day by settling into: "The bed is comfortable, no place to go, nothing to do."
*   In stressful moments, pause and verify your immediate safety and comfort.
*   Shift from a life of "doing" to fix dissatisfaction to a life of "being" in inherent satisfaction.

The ultimate goal is to live from the unshakable understanding that **peace is not a destination to reach, but a present-moment reality to recognize and inhabit.**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate their teachings about mindfulness, perception, and living in the present moment. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **The Storm & The Rock:** This is the core metaphor introduced by Speaker B. The "storm" represents chaos, problems, and external events, while being "a rock within the storm" symbolizes inner stability and groundedness. Speaker A reinterprets this, arguing **the storm comes from inside** (our reaction) rather than from the outside world.

2.  **Being "Caught in the Rain":** Used to distinguish between a neutral event (rain) and a problem (being caught in it and not liking it). The metaphor highlights that suffering arises from our resistance to reality, not the event itself.

3.  **The Mind in a Cast:** Compares a healing broken arm to a mind that needs to heal. Just as a child must stop moving an itchy, healing arm (even if it's uncomfortable), we must "put the mind in a cast" by resting it in the safe, present moment to allow healing from habitual negative patterns.

4.  **Pointing the Gun:** A metaphor for intention and cause-and-effect. Wherever a gun (or our mental focus/attitude) is pointed is where the "bullet" (the outcome, our energy) will go. It teaches mindful attention to where we direct our mental and emotional energy.

5.  **Rinse and Repeat:** Borrowed from shampoo bottles, this is a metaphor for the **need for continual practice**. You must repeatedly "rinse" the mind of unwholesome thoughts and "repeat" the practice of returning to the present.

6.  **Changing Your Mind/Underwear:** A humorous metaphor emphasizing that we should refresh and cleanse our thoughts ("change our mind") even more often than we change our clothes, because the mind collects "dirt" (negative thoughts) so frequently.

7.  **Incrementalism vs. Already Arrived:** Contrasts the common metaphor of life as a **journey or pilgrimage** (always seeking, never arriving) with the teaching that **you are already at the holy site**. Enlightenment and satisfaction are not distant goals but a present-moment reality to recognize.

8.  **Catching the Fish:** Represents unexpected insults or problems ("slings and arrows"). Being present ("here-now") allows you to see them coming and "catch them out of the air" (handle them deftly) instead of being hit by them.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **The Teenage Girl and Affirmations:** A story to contrast empty positive affirmations ("I'm beautiful") with the practice of grounding oneself in actual, present-moment reality. It illustrates why affirmations often fail—they feel untrue.

2.  **The Broken Arm Itching:** An extended anecdote to illustrate the "mind in a cast" metaphor. It shows how our dislike of a sensation (itching) can cause us to interfere with the natural healing process, both physically and mentally.

3.  **The High School Bully:** A story offering practical advice. It illustrates how fear attracts trouble (bullies, barking dogs) and how projecting confidence ("walk fast past him") and disengagement can defuse a threatening social situation.

4.  **The Old Hunter with the Shotgun:** A personal story from the speaker's youth used to teach "wise intuition." It demonstrates the importance of observation and understanding cause-and-effect (where the gun is pointed) over reacting from old instinct.

5.  **The Teacher (Ajahn Po) Visiting the Hut:** A personal story about developing sensitive awareness or "clairvoyance" through deep presence. It suggests that intuition is a trained skill based on acute observation of the present.

6.  **Saturday Night Live Fish-Throwing Skit:** A pop culture reference told as a story to vividly illustrate the benefit of being in the "here-now." The athlete, trained to be present, catches the fish effortlessly, while distracted people get hit in the face. This ties directly to handling life's surprises.

7.  **Waiting in the Bank:** A relatable, mundane scenario used to illustrate how to practice the teaching in daily life. Instead of fidgeting and growing grumpy, one can use the wait as an opportunity to practice "no place to go, nothing to do."

### **Other Key Imagery**
*   **The Zen Koan:** "Nothing to do, no place to go. The spring comes and the grass grows all by itself." This story-like saying encapsulates the theme of effortless being, trust, and non-forcing.
*   **The Concrete Jungle vs. The Natural Jungle:** Contrasts the pervasive, low-grade anxiety of modern society ("concrete jungle") with a more natural state of being, arguing that our social environment creates unnatural tension.
*   **Smoking Mind / Dreaming:** The mind spinning with thoughts is compared to **smoke**, and dreams are the result of the mind "burning and smoking" all night. A calm, present mind at sleep leads to dreamless rest.

**In summary**, the speaker uses metaphors to reframe perception (storm, rain, gun) and practice (rinse/repeat, cast), and tells stories from personal life, common experiences, and popular culture to make the abstract teachings of mindfulness and present-moment awareness tangible, relatable, and practical.
