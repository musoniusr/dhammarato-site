### Transcript


**Speaker A:** But that was a good question, Paul, because, you know, he was just talking about art and stuff and how he's drawing, and is it for the right reasons or wrong reasons? Is it for— I don't know, I used to do a lot of art, and I would always want attention, and I always want praise, like everybody.

**Speaker B:** Does.

**Speaker A:** But then I would start to see that, you know, I'm only doing art because I don't even like doing this shit, you know, half the time. So I concentrated on doing it when I— when it came naturally, when it wasn't like something that was pressured on me to do for unwholesome reasons. So now, uh, I found what I like to do. I like to paint trees, and I like to do it— it comes naturally, you know. I don't even post a lot of it. I don't even need the attention or anything, but if somebody's interested, I'll show them, you know, or talking about art or whatever. But, um, yeah, yeah, so I just try to do, do what comes natural, you know. Hi dudes!

**Speaker C:** Another unwholesome part of the point that when I do make something, then the criticism comes, but I mean, every artist knows this, but it's saying like it doesn't matter what thoughts come and go and just.

**Speaker A:** You're saying when you make something, I didn't catch the end part of that.

**Speaker C:** Oh well, then the judgment and the criticism and so on, but that's just again, just some thoughts that are coming, I guess, that are coming and going.

**Speaker A:** Oh, you criticize your own art, you mean?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah. That's the nature of the beast, you know?

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And some good artwork comes from being over-critical sometimes with your art. Some bad stuff too.

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So it's a dealer's choice.

**Speaker C:** I used to have a mentor who used to say that there's a difference between judgment and evaluation, or there's a difference between what we call Dukkha, dissatisfaction, and divine discontent. You see, you would like to use divine. But divine discontentment where you kind of know that progress is possible and so on and so forth. I think you did say yesterday or whenever that call was that trying isn't terrible, you know.

**Speaker A:** Words are, you know, like I know that Dhammarato is very particular with words and I think that's a great teaching because Basically, you do need to be mindful of what you say and how you say it, you know? And I really thank Dhammarato for that. Where I differ from him, I'm more like— I've more fallen in the direction of Ajahn Sumedho, where words are important, they're guides, but they're not so important you need to watch every single one. And as long as you have an earnest good intention, you can't really fuck up too much, you know what I mean? Like, what do you— you know? So yeah, we could say trying is good in this situation, bad in this situation. This word is better here, this word is better here, but in this situation— it's all semantics. Who knows, you know? I don't really think about it too much. Even when I do talks, sometimes I'll completely contradict myself and I'm watching the video to make sure when I'm editing and stuff, not for these videos but other videos, when I'm editing and stuff, I'm like, "Ah, you totally contradicted yourself there." Oh well. Maybe my point wasn't that important. Maybe I was wrong. Oh well, big deal. I could sit there and be like, oh, but what if that's unskillful and it doesn't help somebody who doesn't hurt? Oh well, you know, my intention is not to harm anybody. My intention is not to cause Dukkha. My intention is to free us all from Dukkha, help guide us all there. And that should be all of our intentions, you know, I would hope. But, uh, how you guys doing, man?

**Speaker F:** Doing well. How are you guys doing?

**Speaker A:** Good, dude. I fell asleep on that Discord the other day when you were talking. I had my headphones on. I was laying down with my son. I was so tired. Like, your voice was so peaceful, I just fell asleep.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, when I, uh, the the Monday calls that I host. I put my 1-year-old to sleep right before the call, and I have to lay in bed with her and put myself into a drowsy state in order to get her to be drowsy and sleepy.

**Speaker A:** Same.

**Speaker F:** And when she falls asleep and she's sort of snoring, then I pick her up and put her in the crib. But sometimes she puts her warm little hand on me and she puts me to sleep.

**Speaker A:** That's wonderful.

**Speaker F:** It's always a challenge to make it to those calls on time because, you know, sometimes she also fights it. So that's why I'm always about 15 minutes late.

**Speaker A:** Oh no. Yeah, I hear you, man. Yeah, same exact situation. My son lulls me to sleep with his tiredness as well.

**Speaker F:** My other child, he's 3. He's always just been the best sleeper on the planet. Once he passes out, you could just pick his I can just conjure his body up and throw it in the bed and it won't wake up.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, sleep is, sleep is a weird thing, but it's pretty awesome.

**Speaker F:** Not that I would ever do that, it's just a, it's just an illustration.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, but, uh, so yeah, uh, nobody's in charge here. We're just chilling, we're just hanging out. Um, I'm just kind of hosting, so if anything's on anybody's mind feel free to talk about it, particularly Dhamma-oriented stuff. Yeah, we're just chilling, so if you have something to say, don't be afraid. You do me a favor if you interrupt me, because I don't even particularly get anything out of talking nonstop. Feel free to interrupt me at any time. Please.

**Speaker F:** I had one thing on my mind, just because Paul is here. And the Friday calls, I'm working, so I just listen in. And Paul, was it you, Paul, who came in and talked about Dark Night of the Soul? Was that you?

**Speaker C:** No, no, but I'm familiar with it.

**Speaker E:** Oh, okay.

**Speaker F:** Someone with a similar voice. Like I said, I wasn't watching. Okay, so maybe it's not relevant then.

**Speaker C:** Well, it's a good topic. I mean, I enjoy that topic, you know.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, like I said, I had the call going, but I was only listening. So whoever asked about that said that they were going through a bit of.

**Speaker C:** A.

**Speaker F:** Depression, sort of. And then they talked about the concept of a dark night of the soul in spiritual traditions, and Dhammarato responded. But what I was thinking about, because I've been through many, many cycles like that in my relationship to the Dharma, and over time it's been clarified exactly what it is, which is just when you understand the Four Noble Truths you see this, there's this direct simultaneous correlation between craving and suffering. And it's almost mathematical, you know, how precise that relationship is. And so, I mean, I believe the Buddha gave us Dukkha as the phenomena to explore so that we could follow that experience instead of a theory or concept. Directly to its root, which is craving. So essentially what I have found is that when we experience something as overwhelming as what people call the dark night of the soul, or even— I'll just stick with that— it's because the level of wanting something we don't have is so intense and we're just not fully aware of it. Our craving, we can call it wanting what you don't have, wanting to get rid of what you don't like. But what happens on the spiritual path is the things that we end up wanting are sort of like concepts, mental phenomena, abstract ideas, you know, in theological or— yeah, theological traditions, people want a direct relationship with God. In Advaita and things like that, people want this sense of union between the Atman and the Brahman. In Buddhism, we want this thing called Nibbana, or sometimes we want lesser things like stream entry or Jhanas and things like that. And most often, like 90% of the time, we don't understand what these words mean and we end up wanting something that's so abstract it has no objective or concrete meaning. And so we're stuck in this pit of extremely strong want with no way of satisfying it, not even knowing where to look, essentially. And so I think that's what elicits that experience that people call the dark night of the soul. You're just stuck wanting something you don't have, and you can't even put your finger on what it is. Those are my thoughts on that when I was listening to that conversation.

**Speaker A:** Beautifully said. Anybody else have anything to add on the dark night of the soul or anything he said?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I often find that I want something and then I get it and then it turns out not to be the thing that I wanted. And then I'm like, well, so now I can't trust what I want because often when I get things I want, those weren't the things I thought they were. Bhikkhuni, etc., etc. So now the whole process of wanting or any kind of motivation has become difficult in the sense that, like, you know, I don't know. But like you said earlier, it's basically that constant— now there's a lot of second-guessing, but it's still guessing. Second-guessing is still guessing, you know. So it's like— Yeah.

**Speaker A:** It's like Dhammarato says, stop trying to get it right and just start getting it happily. It's not about gaining knowledge and getting it right. It's about just letting go and being light and breathing and relaxing and realizing everything's okay here and now. This past and this future, only the ego can travel to the past and the future. So that's why I think Buddha Dasabikkhu and the Buddha is really big on You know, this ego is not permanent. It's like an illusion. Sure, there's a type of self who does stuff during our day or whatever, gets the things on time. But ultimately, if you look at it under a microscope, there's nothing there. And all that thing does is travel to the past and the future. But you know, you can go days. And that's what a lot of the Buddhists do. You know, some instructions that only monks will get sometimes is repeat the word 'buto' over and over, and that might be the only instruction they're ever given by their abbot or master or whatever, and they're okay with that. They go a lifetime and they die with that. Can we be okay with that? Having just the thoughts, feelings, and emotions that bring the peace when we're thinking like 'buto, buto, buto.' And like Dhammarato says, it's not the word really that matters, It's that we're relaxing. We're getting away from the monkey mind and we're just coming back home. And there's people with special needs or brain injuries that will go a whole lifetime without having any really amazing philosophical thoughts or thinking about things so deeply and then understanding them and having aha moments. They don't have any of that. And some of them live very peaceful lives. Being born and dying, just like the plants and trees in nature. So the stuff, we give it this value, but it's all just Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta if we hold on to it, you know. Yeah.

**Speaker D:** For me, I guess I have something about the dark night of the soul to say. Yeah, there's the concept of it, and then there is those points that's like the bottom, or whatever you want to call it, like rock bottom, just intense suffering. And when I've been there, often it gets so intense that I get like focused on it, and the concentration can lead to some equanimity. And then you just— I broke through, and it was intense suffering, but then it was like I was witnessing someone suffering. And then I just noticed the rising and passing away phenomena just coming and going. And I don't know if you want to call that the dark night of the soul. It felt like a dark night, but, uh, just the coming and going impermanence was there. No self was there. And things got better.

**Speaker A:** Nice. Yeah, that's awesome, man. Yeah, there's a reason that terminology, Dark Night of the Soul, and the meanings behind it— there's a reason it's so popular, you know, because it's a phenomenon that happens. Some might call it a bad day. Some might call it this, like, deep depression before some kind of spiritual awakening. Some might call it just natural or normal. But I think it resonates with people because I think psychologically, a dark night of the soul, in my opinion only, would be something that maybe you're— some Kamma that happened in your life, some bad habit that you did that you feel guilty about, that you haven't quite acknowledged. And then you might get older in life and finally acknowledge like, hey, man, that thing you did back then, that was not cool, dude. And this is only now at whatever how old you are that you admit it and you're like, fuck yeah, and you come to terms with it. For me, that's what I would understand is a kind of a dark night of the soul. But it doesn't necessarily even have to be called the dark night of the soul. It could just be called an epiphany or something. And I can't tell you what level of value it has because it's just another passing thought, feeling, and emotion. So in a way, it's just kind of maybe it has some benefit for some people, maybe it doesn't for other people. You know, it is what it is. Hi Alex, how's it going? Hi Jonas.

**Speaker B:** I was going to say though, it can be called a big pile of Dukkha. I see you, Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely. Yeah, big pile of Dukkha. And that's like we were talking about the other day, we were talking about rites, rituals, and superstitions and stuff. And, you know, it goes back to that thing about almost like addiction. It's like, it's not the rites and rituals that are bad in themselves. And it's not even necessarily the thoughts, feelings, and emotions that are bad in themselves. It's the addiction to it. It's the over-clinging to it. It's over-grasping to it that causes this dissatisfaction. The thing is just a phenomenon that occurs and arises and falls away. Like everything else in nature, but we cling on to it. And, oh, so cute. You got any questions, little, little Michael or Michelette, whatever your name is? Michelle? Oh, so cute. But yeah, man. Yeah, see that little baby? That little baby there doesn't have any thoughts, feelings, emotions that are so deep and philosophical and all this stuff. And but they're very simple creatures. When they need something, they let you know by whining and complaining. It's nothing personal. It's just what they do. It's the mind. Like Ajahn Chah said, the mind is a hot iron ball. And you could try to control it, try to figure out a way to fix it, but it's just going to be a hot iron ball at the end of the day. No matter how you hold it, it's going to burn you. So just— it's better just to let it go, let it be. Let the mind do what the mind does. Don't get involved with it. Buddhadasa Bhikkhu said, be like a computer, you know, you go about your day, plant your rice, eat your rice, shit it out. Do whatever, and then sleep and rinse and repeat. And all that drama, all that BS, all that stuff that makes us feel bad, it's not necessary. Completely unnecessary. Days will pass. I always say this, like I've been saying, the reason— but days will pass, months will pass, and you'll see, I haven't been doing anything thought-wise, and everything's still fine. Everything's still operating automatically. Yeah, it's a wonderful thing. It's a wonderful thing to be okay with the way things are, you know, whether it's our body, whether it's our health, whether it's how much money we have, or dreams or aspirations or something. It's quite a lovely thing just to be like, it's good enough, it's okay. I don't gotta— sure, maybe if I want to have a goal, there's nothing wrong with that, but I don't have to beat myself up over everything's perfect just the way it is right now.

**Speaker B:** Coming back to being content with ease rather than being like, oh, I need to find this thing, I need to have this epiphany, that epiphany, you know, doubt, uncertainty, what about this, what about that. And it's like you were saying, Dhamma Dasa, you know, there are folks who have the instructions of like Budo and they sit down and they just practice that, you know, being content and satisfied with just that. So it's pretty simple. It was, you know, very direct.

**Speaker A:** Totally.

**Speaker E:** I got a question if you all don't mind.

**Speaker A:** Shoot, man.

**Speaker E:** So I was just wondering about— I've been on a train today for like 7 hours and this boredom keeps coming up again and again. On these long rides. And, um, yeah, I've just been wondering, like, how you deal with that, or is this like— is like an unwholesome thing to look at, or yeah, just what you think about it.

**Speaker A:** I had an old teacher who would tell me, um, learn to fall in love with being bored, learn to fall in love with boredom. And from the Theravada perspective, you might want to like— the wording is like, oh, don't fall in love, it's too much or whatever. But you get the point, you know what I mean? It's like, learn to be at peace with it. Because boredom only comes when you're going to dukkha land. But when you realize everything's okay as it is right here and now, boredom isn't even a factor. There's neither boredom nor not boredom. It's just irrelevant, you know. Anybody else want to answer that? Hi, Arya. I think I said it right.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, getting better every time.

**Speaker A:** Sweet, dude. Anybody have any tips on how to deal with boredom?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I think that's been helpful. Well, sorry.

**Speaker B:** No, no, go ahead.

**Speaker C:** For me, the thing that's been helpful is to just recognize it as a form of anxiety and then treat it more like anxiety, because it is like basically something other than what's happening should be happening, or I want something that isn't basic Dukkha. And just looking at it more from that perspective, because boredom to me before was just like something that I considered like, oh well, the circumstances are producing boredom. But it's again the attitude. That's what I have.

**Speaker D:** Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, the attitude that it's not some external thing and that we need to satiate it by going to some external means, but rather it's like an internal attitude. And so, yeah, what I find to be very helpful here in terms of boredom is also in a way playing with it or playing with being aware of it. So, you know, it's kind of like playing whack-a-mole with boredom, right? So if boredom does arise, right, we become aware of it. We say, oh, there's boredom, right? And you're playing the boredom game. And so can you really be bored if you're playing the boredom game? Because you're— if you're, you know, if you're not aware of it, then like, okay, you're, you know, you're not playing the game. But if you're aware of it, you become aware of it, you're like, oh, I see. Aboard them, well, then it goes away for a bit, comes back up. So it's just, you become aware of it if it does come up. Okay, not a big problem. And also really, yeah, coming back to being content and satisfied with what is, you know, here and now. Like, just this is enough, right? Just this breath right now is enough. Just relaxing into it, you know. So I think, yeah, I'm talking about boredom and how it relates to anxiety and restlessness, and these are all kind of the same hindrance, right, is that kind of coming down and like being like, hey, we can relax too, and we can just enjoy stilling, right? So we can enjoy breathing, coming back to that. So that's nice as well. But also just being like, hey, you know what, I can work and I can play with becoming aware of this hindrance when it comes up and then also abandoning it. So we can give up boredom, right? So rather than being a victim of boredom, being like, yeah, we can be aware of it and develop that skill of Sati, you know. So it's a wholesome skill. Congratulate yourself when you see boredom, like, hey, congratulations, we saw it, we won the game, right? And then abandon it. And then if it comes back up again, cool, you know what to do.

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker G:** I also wanted to add So it's actually quite important to embrace boredom sometimes because neurologically, I watched a video that spoke about a study that said some of your best ideas, some of your most creative moments come from times of boredom actually, because obviously your brain is searching for something to stimulate itself and eventually it will find something that sticks. So yeah, embrace the boredom. Maybe your next million-dollar idea will come from it.

**Speaker A:** Good advice. Yeah, good advice. It doesn't last too. There's nobody that sits around bored for like 24 hours, really. Yeah, generally speaking, something happens.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, that, that's the thing, right? Like with the boredom game, it's like when you notice the boredom, it's like something's changed there. And that's the other thing, right, is noticing the change like you're talking about, Dhamma Das. It's like things are changing, right? We have this idea when, you know, the mind goes to boredom, oh, nothing's changing, everything's the same. And it's like, no, things are constantly changing, even the state of, you know, boredom itself, right? And that can change actually rather quickly too, especially as we continue to, you know, develop these skills. So the Noble Eightfold Path, the grass.

**Speaker A:** Is always greener too. You might find yourself in war one day and and you might long for those days of boredom. You know, find yourself in a sticky situation, swimming with sharks or whatever, and you'll wish you could just sit on a couch eating Cheetos being bored.

**Speaker F:** I was gonna comment on boredom. I think it's nice to think of boredom as like the doorway to to the deathless in a way, because things like boredom, anxiety, drowsiness, pretty much all of those hindrances, right? They're like the guards against the Dhamma, right? They're like, they're sort of the gatekeepers that keep us turned with our attention towards engagement in sensory stimulation. And so the only pleasure we know is the pleasure of stimulating the senses. And there's positively stimulating sensual experiences, things that we call pleasurable. There's negatively stimulating sensuality, things that we call unpleasant. But the Dhamma itself is this sort of unconditioned, causeless, pleasure or joy or happiness that is the sort of natural state of the mind when it's desireless, when it's empty. And we don't make contact with that because we have this sort of undercurrent of these different forms of craving from boredom to anxiety that guard us from experiencing that. And our conditioning which is pretty much everything that's happening, right? Everything we do is conditioning, right? We have our personal conditioning from our family, we have our cultural conditioning, we have the conditioning that's just inherent with evolution. And so it's always conditioning that's responding to stimulus. You can, you know, remember that the body is an organism and environment, and it has its conditioning that's responding to stimulus. It has its It's personal and cultural familial conditioning. And so this is sort of the constellation of conditions that actually is living this life. And what keeps us from stepping outside of that are things like boredom, right? Things like restlessness, things like anxiety. And the Four Noble Truths, what the Four Noble Truths teach us is that we've held so close to us our entire lives, namely desire or craving, is like a toxic or poisonous close companion that we haven't realized to be what it is our whole lives. Because everything we do, we do in order to get away from the feeling of craving. We Craving is an unpleasant feeling that arises in the body in order to push us towards one activity or another, whether it's something as basic as hunger. Hunger is an unpleasant feeling and we eat to get rid of the feeling of hunger. Sexual lust is an unpleasant feeling and we seek release in order to get rid of that unpleasant feeling. Boredom is an unpleasant feeling. We seek some form of sensory pleasure to get rid of the feeling of boredom.

**Speaker E:** Boredom.

**Speaker F:** Yet because of our ignorance, we want to feel craving, right? So when we're bored and there's no craving, or when we're feeling somewhat peaceful and there's no craving, we try to stimulate craving. So we might be sitting on the couch feeling just fine, and we'll open the computer and look at some pictures of naked girls because we want to make ourselves feel that discomfort and then go and relieve it, because that's the only pleasure we know in life because we're stuck in ignorance. We only know the pleasure of creating an uncomfortable feeling and then seeking a way to get rid of it. That's the absurdity of sensuality that becomes clear when you see the Four Noble Truths. So the conditioning is always to do something about the way you feel. It's always trying to make yourself feel better than you feel, or to feel good if you're not feeling much at all, or to feel better if you're feeling bad. So the thing to do is to do nothing, right? Because conditioning requires fueling, right? So it's like you have a fire and you have to keep adding fuel to it in order for it to keep burning. And where our conditioning is constantly fueling this fire of craving. And so when you encounter boredom, you're sort of getting to like the root of the fire and you could just kind of sit there and keep your hands warm. Don't add any fuel to it, kind of let it burn out. And then you catch a glimpse of the Dharma, of this sort of joy of renunciation, this joy of relief, this joy of desirelessness, depending on how deep it goes. It's a tricky game, but yeah, the best thing to do with feelings like boredom and anxiety is just to— you know, actually, what's his name? I can't remember his name. He comes to the Monday calls. Um, well, anyway, his name might come back to me. He mentioned— no, not Brett.

**Speaker A:** Um, Crash? Who's Crash? Is Crash on— I don't know who Crash is.

**Speaker F:** Is it Jonathan? Maybe.

**Speaker A:** Um, so bad with names.

**Speaker F:** Perhaps. Anyway, he mentioned— he said something that I thought was really interesting. He said that, um, when he's like in a meditative state and something like sadness comes up, he experiences it like a symphony or something, like something beautiful to observe. And there's sort of a pleasure in, instead of trying to do something about the hindrances when they come up, just sort of like, just almost like bearing witness to them or enjoying them, like you're in a dark audience watching a play, a play production being put on for you. You know, you're— it's not you who's putting on the play. You're not a character in the play. You're in the audience, you know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the play of Sila.

**Speaker F:** Just kind of watch it happen. And then that's like, that's one level of freedom. You know, that's maybe the first level of freedom when you can kind of just watch it happen.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's like that movie Office Space. It's a good Dharma movie. You ever see Office Space?

**Speaker F:** Long, long time ago.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, when he gets hypnotized by that dude and that guy dies of a heart attack, and so he's permanently hypnotized, nothing bothers him. He just like— his bosses like are yelling at him, he's like, yeah, okay, whatever. Like everything starts going great for him.

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Then slowly his mind comes back, his mind comes back and greed comes back, and then he's back in the Dukkha again.

**Speaker F:** Oh, interesting. I don't remember it. Oh, that will— I gotta watch it again.

**Speaker A:** Great movie.

**Speaker H:** The Buddha said that ignorance has a nutriment. That nutriment is the five hindrances. I don't want to watch them. I want to throw them out every time I see them. I want to be done with them as soon as they come up. I want to replace them with wholesome thoughts so that I can watch the fire die down nice and easy. I want to make even watching myself die easy. I'm going to toss the fucking hindrances out every time because those are the nutriment for ignorance. Those are the things that stop us from seeing clearly. A hindered mind can't see clearly. By definition, it's hindered, it's in hindrances. So everything's okay, everything's all right, everything's good enough just like it is.

**Speaker A:** We have to be careful we don't get out of balance though, because we might find ourselves going too much to war, practicing too much to the point where it causes like, oh, there's a thing, I got to get it, I got to get this, I got to get it, I can't have any Dukkha, I I gotta— and then we drive ourselves crazy, you know. Instead, like, oh, I had some Dukkha. Oh, okay. Oh well, so what? I like Dukkha, you know what I mean? Bring it on.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, there's also another word, not to shift gears too much, but there's another word that comes up with it, which for me is impatience. I remember Ajahn Sumedho telling the story how Ajahn Chah told him you really got to work on your patience. And when he said that, it was like, oh, I'm impatient. Yeah, it's an aspect of boredom. For example, for example, I listen when somebody speaks slowly on YouTube. I go up to 2 times or whatever and listen to it because I want to hear what they have to say.

**Speaker F:** I'm here for the insight, man.

**Speaker C:** Not the pause, not the silence.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, what Alex said reminds me of what Buddha Dasubhikkhu said. He's like, a lot of people, they want to go to war, you know, with the hindrances, they want to go to war with Mara, they want to go to war with the tiger in the cage, like our mind is a tiger in the cage. But they said instead of trying to spear the tiger and stab it with a sword in the cage and go into war, just let it starve to death, let it be, walk away, go do something else. Say hi tiger, bye tiger, it's not my problem, go walk away, you know?

**Speaker D:** Absolutely!

**Speaker H:** I've been to multiple wars, I'm done with them!

**Speaker E:** Good!

**Speaker H:** They're no fun, there's nothing good about them, nothing nice comes out of war, nothing nice comes out of hatred, nothing nice comes out of impatience.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I heard somebody describe war one time as long bouts of boredom with some rare instances of like chaos.

**Speaker H:** That sounds about right.

**Speaker B:** I think, um, yeah, when it comes to the hindrances, it's not, yeah, about going to war. It's more like, uh, you know, joyfully taking out the trash if the trash does arise, you know.

**Speaker H:** Every time it comes up, you clean it out.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And we, you know, we have the intention, right, of, hey, not— don't go there. We see there's, you know, there's cow pies, right, as you were talking about, um, on last Saturday, right? Dhammarato talking about it like, oh, you know, crap, right? And you don't step in the crap. So we, we, um, keep an eye out for the crap. But if it does happen, if we do step in it, what are we going to do, right? We can you know, dust ourselves off and like continue mindfully, or we can have our mind clouded. Oh, I hate that hindrance. These hindrances are so bad and I hate them. You know, it's like, and then your mind's clouded and then you go and step in even more, right? And so it's just this cycle. So it's like, if it does happen, then it's like, okay, we can come back to kindness and gentleness and for, you know, for ourselves, for the situation at hand, right? And change from the unwholesome to the wholesome.

**Speaker A:** Right?

**Speaker B:** And that can be done, right? But then there's doubt. Oh, I can't interfere with this. I can't do this. You know, I have to leave everything as is, right? If that's a rule, then it's like, oh, we can throw that out too. Throw out all the rules. Just see, like, what is beneficial in this moment, right? And then apply the mind accordingly to abandon, you know, hindrances. We see this junk, it's garbage, it's not worth it. But we don't need to go to war with it. Because that's more hindrance.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's why the dog shit analogy— I think I have to give credit to Dhammarato. That's the first time I heard it. But yeah, it's such a good analogy because, you know, you don't need that much effort, like we always say, to walk around the dog shit or the goose shit. You don't need too much effort, just enough effort to avoid it. Do you see it? And you remember to step to the left or step to the right. And even for people, for like, quote, lay people or the mundane people who've never even heard of the Dharma, there's not much, I would imagine there's not much dissatisfaction for the, quote, generally speaking, normal people on a daily basis. It seems like there's a lot because if you're so clueless when you're walking around in the park and you're stepping in dog shit twice a week, You think it's raining dog shit, I can't get away from dog shit. But for most people, it's like that real dissatisfaction, it comes maybe once, twice a day, a week, whatever. And that's really not much. So the Buddha's like Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. And the wonderful thing is, we practice, when it comes, we remember to identify and walk around it. And it's a very— I think when we talk about Dharma practice, especially for beginners, they have this idea of so much ideas of enlightenment and all these magical shit and all these superstition. And you got a whole wall of books called the Pali Canon. You got a whole wall of professors who studied it their whole life. This seems like such a, like, a task to— but really it's like once in a while dissatisfaction arises throughout our day, or week even for some people, and all you got to do is walk around it when it comes. No big deal. And it reminds me a lot of—.

**Speaker E:** It reminds me a lot of— I think, I think Eckhart Tolle, like, for him, like, he describes these, like, unwholesome thoughts with, like, little monsters, if I remember correctly. And I feel like for a lot of people, it's just like they— it's this little monster and they only see the shadow, which is really big. And they all, like, they think, they continuously think that it's like such a big problem, they're so messed up, but they don't like look correctly and see that it's just a little monster and they just need the right attitude to fix it. So it can be so easy.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's wonderful. Jiddu Krishnamurti said something similar. He said we, we We're scared, we're afraid that there's this big monster around the corner, and we turn the corner and it's just a little puppy dog. Like, yeah, dealing with our Dukkha wasn't that big of a deal in the first place.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, it felt like this when I, when I think when I had the first call with Dhammarato, and like in the end there was nothing much to say. I was like, like my mind kept, kept trying to formulate questions It was just so simple.

**Speaker A:** That's why we always repeat ourselves, and we'll repeat ourselves in the Sangha for the— till the end of time, because there's not much to say really. So we, we come up with clever, interesting ways to say different things, artistic ways to say the same thing over and over. And it's great because it helps to remind us That's the practice itself. So I think for a lot of beginners, they come and they're trying to solve the puzzle box. But for a lot of us who've been doing it a while, I love hearing each one of you guys talk about it. I love hearing even beginners talk about it and ask questions and stuff. I never get bored of it just because it's like, it's such a great, it's such a great thing to be reminded, like Wow, you are enlightened. You are cool. You have a cool mind. Everything's no problem. Such a beautiful thing. I always think of Thich Nhat Hanh, how he would even like grab something on the table and he would do it so like mindfully, so to speak. He was aware of everything. And it's not like he's doing that because he wants attention on this great Zen master. No, it's like He really just seemed to enjoy living, didn't he? You know, just such— he's just like you, even watching his YouTube videos, he's just such peace in everything he did. What a great master he was. And we're all capable of it, you know, we don't have to have the same style and be like him and act like him, but inside of us, it's like, that's a good example, is like this old Zen master who's very peaceful, very calm. Doesn't react to anything. Nothing's a big deal, you know. We remain calm in all situations, relaxing here and now. So anybody else got anything to say?

**Speaker C:** I have that one idea related to the earlier about the cleansing, like cleaning out And for me, it often takes a long time before I start cleaning my apartment. And I think that this came up in some other Dhamma call before, and I think you were on it. But it's like, what I've realized is like, well, if I'm not cleaning it, then it's not bothering me. And when it bothers me, then I do clean it. And so it's simply a matter of that for me.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, totally. Anybody else have anything they want to talk about before we go?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I wanted to ask Jonas. Are you still there, Jonas? Looks like he disappeared.

**Speaker E:** No, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here. I hear you. Hi.

**Speaker D:** Um, how do you normally handle boredom, and do you think you've changed your perspective on it after this?

**Speaker E:** Well, um, I think it does not come up that often for me in like my normal environment, and just when I like in this situation Like today, where I was like 7 hours on the train, it's like really intense because I normally don't feel it that much. And I would say, how do I handle it normally? Good question, because I think I don't have it that much. Probably I try to distract myself from time to time. I think it's fine. Yeah, I might have to think about this more often.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I would say the Dhamma aspect of it is great, but also just like the mundane things, like do what you love and, uh, do more things, do more skillful things, like experiment, try journaling, try drawing. Um, find some new app, new, like, and then bring the Dharma into that doing as well, with the acceptance. Maybe accept it first and then, you know, push yourself.

**Speaker E:** So one thing that helped me a little bit, because a couple days ago I also asked the same question to Dhammarato. I think the video just came up today or yesterday. Maybe somebody has seen it. Um, and he kind of told me, well, if your mind is wondering, if you're bored, then just shortly watch a movie or whatever and then come back to, I don't know, listening to a Dhamma talk or thinking about the Dharma, contemplating the Dharma. And, um, I think this helped me a lot in kind of taking the judgment out of being bored a little bit. And also, and that's what I realized, that I was judging it or myself a lot for being bored. And also, I think you don't have to meditate all the time. You can also play or, I don't know, watch a movie, but be present with it. Enjoy watching a movie for, I don't know, half an hour, and then, I don't know, do something else.

**Speaker C:** I had a cool experience watching a movie the other day because I wasn't enjoying it very much, and so I thought, well, it's boring, but I could do some Anapanasati. And so I was doing it while watching the movie, and I started enjoying the movie. It was amazing.

**Speaker A:** That's wonderful.

**Speaker D:** Amazing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you remembered, remembered to look and you changed it. That's the whole Noble Eightfold Path. You found the doorway in your boring movie that everything's okay and you start enjoying it. Yeah, that is meditation. Yeah, there's a classical meditation of sitting and walking and all this stuff, but yeah, the Remembering looking changing, that is the Sati that we practice. You know, that is something that we can do whenever dissatisfaction arises. You know, and like I said, dissatisfaction is not always arising. A lot of us, you know, have perfectly fine days just doing whatever we're doing. And it seems like, oh, dissatisfaction is always haunting me when we're dissatisfied, but really it's I think we'd be surprised if we look at it with clear eyes how rare it actually is, which thank God for that. Thank Buddha for that. Thank Hanuman. Well dudes, I think I'm going to wrap it up unless anybody has anything dire they want to talk about.

**Speaker E:** Well, uh, I'm so thankful again and again every week for these talks and just, yeah, kind of talking about stuff, reminding myself, and hopefully also you reminding yourself, the Dharma. So thanks a lot.

**Speaker A:** Well, yeah, there's no Sangha without all of us, all you guys. We're all the— yeah, we're all the same. We're all, uh, we're all enlightened Buddhas. Remember that. Yeah, much peace and love, dudes. Thank you for everything, everybody.

**Speaker H:** Much love, everybody.

**Speaker A:** See y'all soon.

**Speaker F:** Thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker D:** You guys have a good one.

**Speaker E:** Take care.

**Speaker C:** Thank you.

**Speaker D:** Bye-bye.

**Speaker F:** See you guys.

**Speaker D:** Peace.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, hosted by Speaker A (likely Dhammarato or a senior student), is an informal, communal discussion where Sangha friends explore practical Buddhist teachings. The conversation flows organically, touching on several core themes:

**Core Themes & Summary:**

1.  **Art & Motivation:** The talk begins with a reflection on creating art. A speaker shares how he moved from seeking praise and attention to painting trees simply because it feels natural and joyful. This illustrates the shift from **unwholesome motivation (craving for recognition)** to **wholesome action (doing what comes naturally without clinging to outcomes)**.

2.  **The "Dark Night of the Soul":** This becomes a central topic. The group analyzes it not as a special spiritual stage, but as an intense experience of **dukkha (suffering/stress)** caused by powerful, often vague, spiritual craving. The insight offered is that such despair arises from intensely **wanting an abstract goal** (like Nibbana, union with God, or a special experience) without clear understanding, creating a frustrating loop of unsatisfied craving.

3.  **Simplicity & Letting Go:** A strong counterpoint to over-complication is offered. The path is framed as simple: **"stop trying to get it right and just start getting it happily."** The practice is about relaxing, letting go of the ego's travels to past and future, and finding contentment with the present. The instruction to repeat a word like "Buddho" is highlighted not for the word itself, but for its function in calming the "monkey mind."

4.  **Working with Hindrances (Boredom):** A question about boredom on a long train ride sparks practical advice:
    *   See boredom as a form of **craving** (for different stimulation) and **anxiety**.
    *   "Play the boredom game": simply **be aware of it** ("oh, there's boredom") without fighting it. This mindful recognition itself changes the relationship to it.
    *   **Embrace or be at peace with boredom**; it can be a doorway to creativity or deeper peace when you stop fueling the craving for distraction.
    *   It's compared to a **guard that keeps us from experiencing the unconditioned joy of the Dhamma**; by not reacting, we let the "fire" of craving burn out.

5.  **Attitude Towards Practice:** A key discussion warns against a militant, striving attitude ("going to war" with hindrances). Instead, the recommended approach is:
    *   **Joyfully take out the trash** when you see unwholesome states.
    *   Use **gentle effort**, like stepping around dog poop—just enough awareness to avoid it without drama.
    *   The path is **not about constant struggle**; dissatisfaction arises occasionally, and the practice is simply to see it and skillfully let it be.

6.  **Community & Reminder:** The talk concludes by emphasizing the value of the Sangha itself. Repeating these simple truths in community is the practice—a **loving reminder** that peace is available here and now, and that everyone is capable of the contentment seen in masters like Thich Nhat Hanh.

**Overall Tone & Message:**
The talk de-mystifies spiritual struggle, framing challenges like artistic doubt, existential despair, and simple boredom as manifestations of **craving and ignorance**. The consistent solution offered is **mindful awareness, relaxation, letting go, and cultivating a gentle, contented heart in the present moment**. The emphasis is on practicality, simplicity, and supportive community over complex philosophy.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several metaphors and stories to illustrate their points about Dharma practice, the mind, and dealing with challenges like boredom and suffering. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **"The nature of the beast"** – Used by Speaker A to describe the inevitable self-criticism that comes with creating art.
2.  **"A dealer's choice"** – Used by Speaker A to say that whether being over-critical leads to good or bad art is a personal matter.
3.  **"Words are... guides"** – Speaker A uses this metaphor to describe language as a tool for pointing to truth, not the truth itself.
4.  **The Mind as a "hot iron ball"** (attributed to Ajahn Chah) – You can't hold it without getting burned; the solution is to let it go.
5.  **The Mind as a "tiger in a cage"** (attributed to Buddhadasa Bhikkhu) – You don't need to fight it; you can walk away and let its "fuel" (attention) starve.
6.  **Conditioning/Craving as a "fire"** – Speaker F explains that conditioning requires fuel. By not reacting (adding fuel), you let the fire of craving burn out.
7.  **Hindrances as "dog shit" or "cow pies"** (credited to Dhammarato) – You don't need a huge effort to deal with them, just enough mindful awareness to step around them. Stepping in it isn't a disaster; you just clean it off.
8.  **Unwholesome thoughts as "little monsters"** (referencing Eckhart Tolle) – They cast a big, scary shadow, but when looked at directly, they are small and manageable.
9.  **Dukkha as a "big monster"** (referencing Jiddu Krishnamurti) – We fear it's a huge monster around the corner, but when we face it, it's often just a little puppy.
10. **Boredom/anxiety as "gatekeepers" or "guards"** – Speaker F describes them as forces that keep our attention turned toward sensory stimulation, preventing us from experiencing the unconditioned peace of the Dhamma.
11. **Being the "audience" to mental phenomena** – Speaker F describes the shift from being an actor in the "play" of your thoughts/feelings to being a peaceful witness in the audience, watching the play unfold.
12. **Living like a "computer"** (attributed to Buddhadasa Bhikkhu) – Simply performing functions (plant rice, eat, sleep) without getting involved in the internal drama.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Art Story:** Speaker A opens with a personal story about shifting from making art for praise to painting trees naturally, without needing to post it for attention. This illustrates moving from "unwholesome" to "natural" motivation.
2.  **The Parenting/Sleep Story:** Speakers A and F share a relatable story about being lulled to sleep by their young children while trying to put them to bed. This highlights natural, peaceful moments in everyday life.
3.  **The Movie "Office Space" Story:** Speaker A references the plot where a character becomes permanently relaxed after hypnosis, illustrating how a non-reactive state can lead to ease, until old habits (greed) return.
4.  **Ajahn Chah and Ajahn Sumedho Story:** Speaker C recounts how Ajahn Chah told Ajahn Sumedho to work on his patience, linking impatience to the feeling of boredom.
5.  **Cleaning the Apartment Story:** Speaker C shares a personal realization about only cleaning when the mess *bothers* him, using it as a metaphor for dealing with hindrances only when they become an active source of dukkha.
6.  **Watching a Movie with Anapanasati:** Speaker C tells a brief story about practicing mindfulness of breath while watching a boring movie, which unexpectedly made the movie enjoyable. This demonstrates applying meditation in daily life.
7.  **Thich Nhat Hanh's Demeanor:** Speaker A references the peaceful, mindful way Thich Nhat Hanh performed simple actions, not for show, but as a natural expression of his calm state. This serves as an inspirational example.

### **Overall Themes of the Metaphors & Stories:**
*   **Effortlessness vs. Struggle:** Many metaphors (hot iron ball, tiger in cage, dog shit, little monster) emphasize that the path is about wise, gentle awareness, not violent struggle or "war."
*   **Simplicity of the Dharma:** The recurring message is that the core practice is simple: see dissatisfaction, remember to look, and change your relationship to it. The metaphors demystify enlightenment.
*   **Everyday Life as Practice:** The stories (parenting, cleaning, watching movies) ground the Dharma in ordinary experience, showing that practice happens in moments of boredom, art, and chores.
*   **Dealing with Mental Hindrances:** A central theme is how to relate to boredom, anxiety, and self-criticism—not as enemies, but as phenomena to be aware of and skillfully navigate.
