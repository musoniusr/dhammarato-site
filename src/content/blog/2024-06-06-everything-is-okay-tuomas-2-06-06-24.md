### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Was.

**Speaker B:** Exploring right effort.

**Speaker A:** Exploring right effort. Yeah. All right, there's no exploring. Right effort is right effort to change unwholesome thoughts. Right effort is right effort to change unwholesome attitudes. And right effort is to change the emotions. That's what right effort is, is to make a change. And it's as easy as going down the highway and making a left turn. If you're going too fast, you miss your turn. Or worse still, you think you can make it when you're going too fast and you wind up veering into things. So one of the qualities is to be able to slow down, remember to look at what's going on, and then make a change. Now, your second question was a question about emotions. Let us say emotions are the brick wall that you run into because you didn't turn left in time. Emotions are great big things that in fact that would be the craving. Emotions come from craving, big heavy-duty, I don't like what happened. Emotions like sadness, Grief, anger— those are the really big heavy ones. And that they didn't start off heavy, okay? It was like if you, you, you go into the forest and you see a giant oak tree, a great big angry oak tree. Guess what? That oak tree didn't start off as a great big angry oak tree. It started off as a seed. And that's what we have to start paying attention to, is the little things that we can change, not the great big things. In other words, you can't change your destiny by changing your destiny. You can't change your habits by changing habits. That you can't change your actions by changing your actions. We have to start with the things that we can change. And what we can change is the thought that we're having right now. Because the thought that we're having now grows into the great big giant feelings that we have. And so if you've got a great big angry feeling, or a great big grief feeling, or a great big sadness feeling, That's because you've been thinking for a while on it. And so when are you going to start looking at what you're thinking and change that? Divert those thoughts. Start having happy thoughts. Anger, emotions, grief, sadness, lust, All the really big stuff doesn't get started all really big. They're already tiny little things, but we let them grow and get out of hand. One way of looking at it is that our thoughts give rise to just a little feeling of liking and not liking. The little thoughts and the little feelings that we have give rise to our speech, and our speech gives rise to our actions, and our speech and our actions give rise to our habits, and then our actions and habits give rise to our destiny. Great big life destiny, right? But if you can change the thoughts you're having, then you can change the way you feel. And part of that destiny is to have great big emotions. And if we can see early, we can divert those emotions by changing our thought. And thoughts are easy enough to change that in fact the whole story that I've heard for most of the time of Buddhism— this didn't happen in the time of the Buddha, but it certainly happened by the 5th century. And for 1,500 years they've been using the term monkey mind. Have you ever heard of the term monkey mind? One of the qualities of monkey mind is that the monkey mind just jumps all over the place, right? Well, if that's the case, that means that every time that the monkey has a mind or has a thought, he changes it and goes to another thought, and it bounces here and there and there, which meant that it must be really easy to change the thought from here to there. Easy to change your thoughts. But if we get stuck on one, then we're going to start having a lot of feelings about that one thought. That in fact if we get stuck on a kind of a thought, we're going to start having an attitude about that thought, like the attitude of a loser. One student has just said that when I was a kid, I got hit, and then over time I got hit 5 or 10,000 times, that I was a victim to all the bullies. So when you say this or that, it sounds to me like you're bullying me. Well, that's just his attitude. When I say the truth, people can't handle the truth because they're in that position. They've got the mentality, "I can't handle the truth." How many times have we had those kind of thoughts? "Oh, they're picking on me." So, the way that we can handle those thoughts is by Waking up and taking a look at the thought that we're having right now. Never mind the thoughts that we had 10 seconds ago. What are the thoughts we're having right now? Because those are the thoughts we can change. And we can change the thoughts into having a happy thought. A happy thought would be, wow, I'm glad I saw that. Everything is okay. I can just rest right now. The job that I needed to do was to see that thought, and now that done, the job is done. I got nothing to do, no place to go. Wow, what a relief it is. I can relax. Now, when you're having thoughts of, wow, how nice it is, I can relax, the job is done, where are those great big emotions?

**Speaker B:** Nowhere to be found.

**Speaker A:** They're not going to be there. Why? Because you're having wholesome thoughts. Those great big emotions come from having unwholesome thoughts over and over and over again until they build up into a giant emotion. So when you think about a dead puppy and you don't like it, you can say, never mind, I've got another puppy. When a puppy dies and you don't like it, you can say, well, I'll go get another one. I can find everything, no problems. I don't have to be in grief because the puppy dies. So we can change that grief by changing our mind. Everything is okay, everything is fine. The puppy died, didn't kill me, I'm all right. The laptop died, but it wasn't me that died. The car is wrecked, but it's not me that's wrecked. I'm okay. So you keep having thoughts. Anytime you can think of some disaster, you can say, aha, but I'm still okay. Yeah, somebody called me a jerk on Reddit, but I'm still okay. Better I don't read Reddit. People who go to Reddit, they feel bad. That's why they go to Reddit. Oh, please pick on me. Oh, please tell me what a bad Buddhist I am. So it's better just to stay away from that stuff, to come have wholesome thoughts, to come talk to people who are going to give you happy, pleasant, true, in-reality thoughts. Nothing to it. It's easy. And you're asking about a great big emotion, like a giant tree. It's going to take a chainsaw that you don't have to cut down that tree. Better you just walk away from that tree and go deal with trees you can do something about. So when that thought is a little thought, you can say, okay, I can change that thought. Let's not go have those great big heavy thoughts with great big heavy emotions and have thoughts of everything is okay. Can you say that, Thomas? Can you say everything's okay?

**Speaker B:** Everything's okay.

**Speaker A:** Everything is fine. Not a problem in the world. I'm okay.

**Speaker B:** I'm okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, those are the kind of thoughts to have. Let those be the ones that grow into an emotion that we can call confidence. Begin to gather a winner's attitude. An Arahant, not a victim. You see those great big emotions, you feel like you're a victim to them. They're overpowering. But the reality is that you can feel any way that you want to when you have the attitude that you can do this. Yeah, I can handle that. All those great big emotions are nothing. I just worked myself up into them. And now I don't work myself up. I could just say everything's okay, don't have to work at all. And then you can begin to have those kind of powerful thoughts like, wow, I can handle this. Wow, this is good. Wow, I'm glad I figured out that I don't have to go do anything, that I can just sit here and be happy. No work to do, no place to go. The work, the job that needed to be done was to change those thoughts. And when we've changed those thoughts, the job is done. Wow, isn't it nice that the job is done and life is easy? My thoughts are as pure as a polished shell. Everything is okay. All you have to do is just keep repeating that over and over again. It's not a matter of focus, it's a matter of repetition. Remember to look at what you're doing and make a change into the wholesome.

**Speaker B:** Then if there is too much.

**Speaker A:** Of.

**Speaker B:** It, it's going to become tension. Like I noticed during the, at the end of the day sometimes when I have practiced a lot, many hours, I mean short periods of times, not like 15, 20 minutes, that's when I feel more.

**Speaker A:** Double Arhat, or not.

**Speaker B:** And during the day it might feel like creating some thoughts, it becomes very like kind of lifting heavy weights, and then it's just easier to sort of just stay relaxed, not creating much.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dm] Yeah, when we lift those heavy weights and carry those heavy weights around, We get tired. That's the emotions. We get tired of those emotions because they're heavy. So when we can see that I'm carrying a weight that I don't have to carry, I can set that thing down. This is what the teaching of the Buddha is, is to have knowledge of that which is heavy so that we can set it down. The knowledge that those rules about how things should be, the idealism, the way that the world is supposed to be, that in fact, that's what makes a political party, is its platform. And its platform is a set of rules about how they think that the world should be. So in a way, those rules are like politics. And when we recognize the world is already okay, I don't have to go fix anything, I don't have to have an idealistic view of the world, the way the world is right now is already okay. Wow, that means I don't have to do anything. Nothing to do, nothing to gain. The world is already okay. We live in paradise. My, what a nice paradise this is. The only problem with paradise is so many people who were in my paradise don't know that they're in paradise. They go around wrecking the place, trying to fix it, and it's not even broken. That's the very interesting thing about paradise, is that it doesn't matter what people do to it. They don't destroy paradise. They just destroy their version of it, their ideas of it. They have a great big bunch of emotions about paradise because they can't even see paradise. They're not living in reality. They're living in a made-up unhappy world. So when you see that you're making your emotions, when you see that you're making up that paradise into a hell, And you just stop doing that and say, oh, it's okay. This is already a paradise. I don't have to turn it into a hellhole by trying to fix it. Don't have to tweak a thing. It's already okay. Wow, what a relief it is. No place to go and nothing to do. So there's really no such thing as great big emotions. There are just people who manufacture great big emotions. They're living in a fantasy world. The reality is everything's already okay. What a relief it is. What a relief. Everything is already okay. Don't have to fix a thing. There's nothing broken. Everything is hunky-dory. Even if Dory is hunky, it's still hunky-dory.

**Speaker B:** Oh wow, yeah, there was an— oh, congratulations! There was nothing to it. I was not okay. I noticed that now.

**Speaker A:** Wow, awesome! Yes, so you congratulate yourself, Thomas. You can see that you're already okay. Give yourself a pat on the back. Wow, everything is okay.

**Speaker B:** Everything is okay.

**Speaker A:** You just keep remembering to remember that. Keep remembering that all of those great big emotions are coming from unwholesome thoughts. And I can change those thoughts to everything's okay, everything is fine, not a problem in the world. And you'll be okay. You are okay. You're already okay. It's the thoughts that you're not okay. They create those emotions. Nothing to it. Everything's all right. Ah, what a relief. So you go practice this, keep doing this over and over again. So let's go ahead and finish this call, make it easy, and you go practice everything is okay, everything is all right. Wow, what a relief it is that everything is okay. Then give me a call next week or so. All right, and we'll talk to you again about how nice things are, how everything is already okay, what a paradise this is. All right, so we'll see you.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) in dialogue with a Sangha friend (Speaker B), focuses on the practical application of **Right Effort** and the nature of **emotions**.

### **Core Teaching: Right Effort is About Changing Thoughts**
Dhammarato defines Right Effort not as an abstract exploration, but as the direct work of changing unwholesome thoughts, attitudes, and emotions. The key is to **intervene early**, before small thoughts grow into overwhelming emotions.

*   **The Analogy:** He compares it to driving and making a turn. If you're going too fast (caught up in thought), you'll miss the turn or crash. You must **slow down**, observe your current thought, and change course.
*   **The Seed of Emotion:** Big emotions like anger, grief, or sadness don't start big. They begin as tiny thought-seeds. If we nurture them with repetitive thinking, they grow into giant, seemingly immovable "trees." Right Effort is about noticing and changing the seed, not trying to chop down the full-grown tree.

### **The Chain of Cause and Effect**
The talk outlines a clear causal chain:
1.  **Thoughts** → give rise to small **feelings** (liking/disliking).
2.  Thoughts & Feelings → lead to **speech** and **actions**.
3.  Speech & Actions → solidify into **habits**.
4.  Habits & Actions → shape our **destiny** (including a destiny of heavy emotions).

By changing our thoughts at the beginning of this chain, we alter the entire trajectory.

### **Practical Method: "Everything is Okay"**
The primary tool offered is **thought substitution**. When an unwholesome or distressing thought arises:
1.  **Wake up** and notice the thought you are having *right now*.
2.  **Change it** to a wholesome, reality-based thought like:
    *   "Everything is okay."
    *   "I'm okay."
    *   "The job was to see that thought, and now it's done. I can relax."
    *   "What a relief."
3.  **Repeat** this consistently. It's not about intense focus, but **remembering to remember**. This builds a "winner's attitude" of confidence instead of a victim mentality.

### **On "Monkey Mind" and Paradise**
*   **Monkey Mind:** Normally seen as a problem, Dhammarato reframes it. The mind's tendency to jump shows that **thoughts are inherently easy to change**. The problem is when we get "stuck" on one and repeat it.
*   **The World is Already Paradise:** The greatest suffering comes from our idealistic rules about how the world *should* be. When we drop that and see that **reality as it is is already okay**, we stop "wrecking paradise by trying to fix it." Heavy emotions are a sign we're living in a fantasy, not in reality.

### **Key Takeaways:**
*   **Right Effort is immediate:** Change the thought you are having *now*.
*   **Emotions are manufactured:** They are the result of accumulated, unchallenged thoughts.
*   **The tool is simple:** Substitute "everything is okay" for distressing narratives.
*   **The result is relief:** When you see nothing is broken and nothing needs to be fixed, you can put down the heavy weight of your own mental constructions and relax.

The talk concludes with Speaker B having a moment of insight, realizing "I was not okay. I noticed that now," and is encouraged to practice this gentle remembrance that everything is already all right.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several powerful metaphors and a central story to explain the concepts of **Right Effort**, **thoughts**, and **emotions**. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Driving & Missing a Turn:** Right effort is compared to driving down a highway. If you're going too fast, you miss your turn or crash. This illustrates the need to **slow down**, **pay attention**, and **make a deliberate change** before it's too late.

2.  **Brick Wall:** Emotions (like grief, anger, sadness) are described as a **"brick wall that you run into because you didn't turn left in time."** This shows emotions as the painful, solid consequences of not addressing unwholesome thoughts early.

3.  **Oak Tree:** This is the **central, extended metaphor**.
    *   **Giant Oak Tree:** Represents a **big, overwhelming emotion** (e.g., anger, grief).
    *   **Seed:** Represents the **initial, small thought** that started it.
    *   The point is that big emotions don't appear suddenly; they grow from tiny, manageable thoughts we nurture over time. You can't easily chop down the giant tree (emotion), but you can prevent the seed (thought) from growing.

4.  **Chainsaw vs. Walking Away:** Dealing with a full-grown emotional "tree" requires a "chainsaw you don't have." It's better to **"walk away from that tree"**—meaning, stop feeding the big emotion—and instead deal with the small, new "trees" (thoughts) you can actually manage.

5.  **Monkey Mind:** A classic Buddhist term used to describe the restless, jumping nature of thought. The speaker uses it to make a positive point: if the mind jumps so easily from thought to thought, then **changing a thought must be inherently easy**. The problem is when we let it get "stuck" on one.

6.  **Lifting Heavy Weights:** Carrying around unwholesome thoughts and the resulting emotions is likened to **lifting and carrying heavy weights**. It's exhausting. The solution is the insight that allows you to **"set that thing down."**

7.  **Politics / Platform:** Our rigid rules and ideals about how the world "should be" are compared to a **political party's platform**. They are a constructed set of rules that cause suffering because reality doesn't conform to them.

8.  **Paradise Wreckers:** The world is already a paradise (okay as it is). People who don't see this are like inhabitants who **"go around wrecking the place, trying to fix it, and it's not even broken."** They only destroy their own *idea* of paradise, not reality itself.

### **Story / Anecdote**

*   **The Student's Story:** The speaker references a student who, as a child, was repeatedly hit by bullies. Over time, this created a victim mentality and an **attitude** where even truthful statements felt like bullying. This story illustrates how **repeated thoughts (I am a victim) solidify into an attitude, which then filters all future experiences**, creating emotional reactions. It shows the progression from thought to destiny.

### **Core Narrative Arc**

The talk weaves these metaphors into a clear **cause-and-effect story**:

1.  **The Seed:** A small, unwholesome thought arises (e.g., "I don't like this").
2.  **The Growth:** If not changed, it is repeated and grows, leading to speech and actions.
3.  **The Habit:** These repeated actions form habits.
4.  **The Destiny:** These habits solidify into a life destiny and the experience of **"giant oak tree" emotions** (anger, grief).
5.  **The Solution:** The chain can be broken at the very beginning. By **changing the initial thought** to a wholesome one (e.g., "Everything is okay"), you prevent the giant emotion from ever growing. This is "Right Effort"—the easy turn taken early.

**In summary:** The speaker uses the **Oak Tree (from seed to giant tree)** as the master metaphor for emotional suffering, supported by the **Driving** metaphor for the need for timely intervention and the **Heavy Weights** metaphor for the exhaustion it causes. The **Paradise** metaphor reframes the ultimate goal: not to battle emotions, but to see the inherent okayness of reality that makes those emotions unnecessary.
