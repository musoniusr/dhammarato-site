### Transcript


**Speaker A:** That's right, don't record them. Okay guys, so we were talking about grief and what we're supposed to grieve over, like the loss of someone, and that if we are close to a blood relative in proximity for many years, then we're going to grieve over that person. Now, here's something that's actually— this is very indicative— that if you have a wife, a lover, a girlfriend, and she dies, then we're going to grieve a lot. But we could have gotten then a divorce And after the divorce is over, years after the divorce, and then she dies, we don't do much grieving. So these are the indications, you know, just some evidence about how life is. But the important point that we were starting to make is that we grieve over the loss of someone because we're supposed to grieve over the loss of someone, that this is We are taught this all of our lives. One example that I remember was when I was 6 years old, my grandfather died. My grandfather died, and that I remember specifically the funeral, because the funeral was at the Methodist Church, and we went to the Baptist Church, and it was down the block and around the corner or something. And I'd never been into that church before. And here I am, a 6-year-old, and I'm dealing with my mom's— dealing with her grief, when in fact she didn't like him. He was not a likable guy, and that they didn't get along. But after but because when he died, she grieved because she was supposed to grieve. And I remember that. And I remember that when the casket was being pulled out right in front, you know, they took everybody in the family, went up to the vestibule of the church, and then they pulled the casket out through the front door of the church. And as this casket was passing by, my mom squeezed my hand really hard in her grief. And I looked at my— I kind of looked up at my mom and says, you didn't like this guy. I already knew that. You— I mean, you spent so much time telling me how much you didn't like him. And now when he died— Dhammarato? Yes.

**Speaker B:** I was gonna say, I'm curious you know, if any of those reactions may also be due to an.

**Speaker A:** Kind of.

**Speaker B:** Like a catharsis, if you could say, from the person that has spent so much of their time and their mind space disliking someone. You, when that person passes, It's like the ultimate, like, vulnerability, if you will, right? They're ultimately vulnerable now because they're gone. There's nothing they can do. And so you're like, you have to face your, your assholeness, I guess you could say, your disregard for people, your selfishness. And so in facing that, you see, wow, I spent all my time convincing myself how much of an asshole this person was, when now they're dead and it doesn't even matter. Like, now they're dead. They're dead and I'm alive. Who's the asshole now?

**Speaker A:** You know, that's— you've got it. That's exactly right. In other words, I would think that when my grandfather died, at that moment it probably hit her that she could have been better to him than she was, that she felt guilty, that guilt was her feeling rather than a sense of loss.

**Speaker B:** Right. And I felt that with my dad too.

**Speaker A:** I did.

**Speaker B:** That's something I felt with my dad.

**Speaker A:** We do that. In fact, guilt is possibly, um, let us say it's in that mix and it's possibly the predominant feeling. Yeah, because we don't really have a proper say goodbye. I mean, if you had, uh, a friend who was getting on a spaceship an Elon Musk spaceship and goes to Mars and you'll never see him again. You can have a warm goodbye and then fond memories of him, though you may not hear of him with the expense of the price of tickets or communications or whatever like that. So if somebody does leave us, I remember that. In fact, there was a kid, his name was Keith. And that Keith lived across the street. He had a horse named Trigger, a pony actually, and that his family for some reason moved to Muskogee, Oklahoma, and that I missed him a lot. I really, really missed my friend, but I was actually able to go visit him. Now, this actually— this all happened when I was 5. This happened before we went to school together, but we played a lot. And so even at that young age, I remember that sense of loss of a friend. I had lost him. He moved out of town, and I really, really missed that. So that sense of loss is one thing that we have to deal with. But in the death maybe of a relative or a close friend, we often add that aspect of guilt to it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Like, oh, I should have done this. The example that I used that triggered you was that I should have taken that puppy to the vet, and now the pet— now the puppy's dead, right? Shoulda, woulda, couldas. And so that guilt is there. Now, the loss of a friend, like, uh, with, with Keith, or a friend moving to Mars, they didn't die. And so we're not dealing with that quality of it, but they're gone. Yeah. And so it seems like that the missing someone, um, is, uh, let us say, not actually labeled related to death itself, but the guilt is. We feel guilty, we feel bad because somebody died, and we kind of think of what I could have done, what I should have done, etc.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and I think like my journey of this whole thing has been, you know, and working with you too and seeing that it's really no different than Anapanasati. Really, after my dad died, there was to see the unwholesome and throw out the unwholesome and then be in joy. And the thing is, is that with death, it's not straight unwholesome. So there's a little bit of a tweak to it. And what I found is that you're going to get emotions. Things might hit you like a truck. You may not even see it coming, and all of a sudden you're crying. Celebrate. 'Wow, how amazing it is to experience this, experience this love I have for my dad. Love you, Dad.' That's what I do. I wake up in the morning, I'll see him in my memory, I'll see him in my mind, and I'll— it'll be tinged with a little bit of sadness, and I'm like, 'Oh, love you, Dad. It's all good.'.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. That's exactly right. That's exactly that point of Sati, is to remember that you can think of your dad without going through the guilt and the loss. That instead you could say, "Hello, Dad, my old friend.".

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and actually what's really interesting is that is way more intense of an experience than getting subdued into the, "Oh, this is sad," or, "This is so heartbreaking, this is so terrible." Because when you look at something that is supposedly, or that appears evil, or appears like it's going to harm you, and then you're like, wow, oh man, love you, Dad, that's amazing. You totally— it's like what Kishon was saying earlier, you've won the game. You've won the game. You've won the game.

**Speaker A:** That's right. That's exactly right. We can win the game of life. We were born into the game of life as victims. We were taught how to be victims really excellently by all the victims around us. And now with Anapanasati and with the Buddha Dharma, we're recognizing that we can in fact be a winner in our life. We do not have to be the victims. Our choice. That we can in fact have fond memories of a deceased relative, or a neutral feeling if that's it, but we don't have to grieve. It's almost like we're obligated to grieve.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's a good point, or expected to. And the conversation about it and expecting it and how you basically feel sorry for everyone that experiences it. And, you know, we even, oh my God, I can't, people have like, and they mean well, but they've imposed their view on, you know, on me. And they'll say like, Well, it's going to be really hard. It's going to suck. It's going to really suck at first, but it'll get better each day. Or they'll be like, you know, the pain never goes away, or the pain gets better each day, but it never goes away. And I was like, man, we gotta wake this world up. We gotta wake this world up.

**Speaker A:** I know. That's right. That's such an ordinary way of looking at it, is that we're supposed to grieve, or this is how it is. Because we don't recognize we've got that choice. And so I gotta— so I gotta congratulate you, Alex, that you actually came through this really, really well. You could have really, really been in the funk for a long period of time, and you come right— yeah, you come right back out of it. So congratulations for for that. This is what the Dharma really is all about. You've heard me say it many times, is that we have to develop Sati as a skill so that it'll be there when we need it most. Okay, and this is one of those times when you really needed it most, and you were actually able to remember that you can in fact feel the way that you want to feel, that you can celebrate your dad, you could be happy that you knew him. You can be grateful that he gave you life, and you don't have to be guilty at all. Yeah, no need for guilt, no need for remorse.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I genuinely feel like my dad's passing is— I don't know, it feels so weird to say this, but it's just one of the best gifts he probably could have ever given me. He gave me the gift of death. Of coming to terms with death and seeing what that is and being intimate with it and accepting it in its beauty and in its terror, all of it. And that's really nice. It's really nice.

**Speaker A:** Actually, death, in kind of an abstract way, or let us say in a kind of a big way, death actually allows beauty. Now, what do I mean by that? It means that if everybody was living forever, this present moment would be meaningless because you've got so many trillions of them. But because we all know that we've got less than 100 years, We all know that. And then in fact, when Dad or someone close dies, that reminds us, okay, that this is something that's very interesting. Um, I, I watched the dogs here when the puppy died, and they, they sniffed and then they left. They didn't want to have anything to do with it, with her, okay? Animals are like that. They can see another dead animal and it doesn't ring that bell that I too am temporary. The dogs have no sense of that kind of a future, okay? They don't understand puppiness, adulthood, old dog, and dead dog. They don't have those kind of concepts. They only have the concept of right here, right now. But humans have that, that knowledge. And that, um, let us put it this way: the most beautiful music that has ever been written is often from that sense of loss, losing someone. Okay. That in fact most of the, let us say, more popular music is more about losing a girlfriend than losing and death. But in the old days, like with Ravel and Pavan and Bach's Requiem in B minor, those kinds of pieces of music, that have to do with loss and death. Another one, in fact, possibly my favorite, is the Pathétique. You can hear the word pathetic in it. Pathétique by Tchaikovsky, his Sixth Symphony. And, and it is just absolutely so gorgeous, just makes you cry, it's so beautiful. But it was because of his loss of his wife. And also the sense that he was getting close to death, too. Another example is the Ode to Joy by Beethoven, because he wrote that right at the end of his life. Okay? But Schubert also, there was an unfinished symphony that was so gorgeous, but it wasn't finished because he died. And so, someone, his best friend who was also a great musician, finished that symphony, so that it could be published and played, because it was so gorgeous, it was so beautiful. That pathos that's within us is the beauty that we have. That in fact, watching the Mona Lisa, deteriorate and fall apart over the centuries, and having it restored and not well and all of that, is part of what makes that art piece so beautiful. When it was new, there was nothing much to it. But when art gets really, really old and starts to deteriorate is when it begins to get more beautiful. And so with music and with art, we can see that this pathos that we have within us is actually— it's a major part of us, just like life and death is a part of us. That death quality, that loss, that sense of losing something, that if we dwell on, oh, poor me, I didn't— I lost it, I'm worse off now, etc., like that. Than reminiscing.

**Speaker C:** It.

**Speaker A:** The whole quality of being able to relish the fact that everything is temporary. Your dad was temporary. Okay, question.

**Speaker B:** I think this is a very good segue. Well, I know that Dhammarato and I talking about death this whole time, Kishon, but if you are interested in talking about something else, please feel free to go ahead.

**Speaker C:** Okay, sounds like— sorry, I was gonna respond, but I have my phone. I'm using my phone and my laptop at the same time, but no problem. It was a couple of extra thinking steps, but I've just been enjoying this.

**Speaker B:** Conversation.

**Speaker C:** And I don't know if I have too much to add, but— Okay, cool.

**Speaker B:** I have a question that I think will bring us a little further. So, Dhammarato, I was on the phone with Dan the other day, Danny, you know, your student, your old student. Yeah, he was helping me, you know, with everything as well. And this is in the very beginning. And I, you know, I told him, I was like, it's crazy, like, you can be here and then you can just die. And he was like, yes, on one level, yes, you, if you identify with the body, right, that has the, you know, the name of Alex and this and that, then yes, technically you do die. But if you are the awareness in which all those things occur, the awareness in which the life and death of the body occurs, well then that's a different kind of experience. Now he said it a lot better than that, so please do not judge my rendition of what he said as what he said, because he's much more articulate than that, so I apologize. But, um, yeah, I was curious if you had any thoughts on that because, um, I've been, you know, kind of dipping my head in that one as.

**Speaker C:** Well.

**Speaker A:** Just tell me again what you're talking about. Danny said what?

**Speaker B:** Um, Dan said that, you know, he's like— I was like, you know, I was like something like, it's a tragedy, like we, we live and then we like, we die. And I was like saying something about like the tragedy of it and He was like, well, yeah, you do die if you are identified with a body that has a name that was born, and so on, so on, so on. But then there's also this other level where it says, unless you are, or if you identify with the awareness in which all of these things.

**Speaker A:** Occur. Right, okay. So yes, basically what he's talking about then is the distinction between are we going to take a selfish view, or are we going to take an altruistic view? Okay, what do we mean by a selfish view? Is, oh, my dad died, oh, poor me, and we wallow in our self-pity, we wallow in our guilt and our sense of loss and all of that kind of stuff because we're looking very small. Me and my friends. Me and my dad, and that the other way of looking at it is taking a broad look, a look at humanity, and a look at the fact that all of humanity grieves over the loss of someone because they're not well trained in how to handle it. That in fact, when things are, let us say, the idea of forbidden fruit, you can see that with teenagers in the sense of their relationship to alcohol or to drugs or to the girls or opposite sex, any of that kind of stuff. It's kind of like a forbidden fruit. And that we gotta have it because it's forbidden. Okay, so staying alive permanently is kind of a forbidden fruit. We're not supposed to do that, and because of that, it's enticing. I mean, here's something that throughout history— and we have people doing it now too— you've heard of Ponsta Leon looking for the Fountain of Youth. And look how much work and everything that he spread. But in fact, when I was in school, I heard that he was in Florida looking for the Fountain of Youth. And now I've talked to some people who were born and raised in Brazil, and they know Bhante because he was in South America looking for the Fountain.

**Speaker B:** Of.

**Speaker A:** Youth, and they didn't even know he was in Florida. Okay, now, now there's— and now the other side is, is that, um, oh, ancient emperors, they used to think somehow that mercury was a medicine, and because of that, many people died of mercury poisoning. Because they thought that it was an elixir that would give them eternal life. Why they chose mercury, I don't know, because mercury's poison. But in fact, there's still a mountain that is so contaminated with mercury that they don't even want to do the proper research of the archaeology because it's a burial mound and it's just absolutely full of mercury. So nowadays you will find— have you ever heard of cryogenics, where when somebody is dead or about to die, they'll take the body and freeze it with liquid nitrogen with the hope of being able to revive it someday?

**Speaker B:** I've never heard that. No.

**Speaker A:** Oh, you haven't heard that? Yes, there are. There is still— I mean, there's a corporation that has, I don't know, dozens and dozens of bodies that they're preserving. You have to have a huge amount of money as an endowment to keep your body that cold, with the hope someday that medical science will be able to resurrect you. There are also a lot of— it's crazy. Right, and there's all kinds of longevity stuff. I just saw something on YouTube to where can they reverse the aging till they get it down to the zero point. There's— they're learning to slow down aging, and the part of the slowing down I think is more demographics, that when people don't die young of so many diseases and accidents, then that increases the the lifespan for everyone. But the point is that life is better when there is death. That's the point that I'm making, that everybody clings to life and wants to have life and live forever and find the fountain of youth or try to find a way of staying alive forever, but that's out of greed. That's out of a sense of fear of death. And a much, much better way of looking at it is, is that my death is coming, your death is coming. Let's have a celebration that we're still alive, because that's not going to last.

**Speaker B:** Exactly, exactly. That's what I— that's the realization I've been struck with.

**Speaker A:** Last week. And so having your dad die then is a big, big wake-up call for you to be alive.

**Speaker C:** I was having the thought that, um, in addition to the cryogenics and all the other things that you mentioned, one of the other ones, uh, like, like a sci-fi kind of theory, is the singularity, that you could get uploaded into the ether and your consciousness can live on. But like you said, if there's no end to it, is it really going to be quite as good? You know, even if you can just dial up your experience with whatever number you plug in.

**Speaker A:** But that whole quality of plugging in, like with AI, that we plug something into the brain, just sucks all of the knowledge, all the memories, all of the everything out, puts it into a computer. And now there's a robot that downloads from that computer, and that's a walking, talking robot. That's me, right? That's what— that's— no, that robot is not you. This body dies, and that we can celebrate that, that celebration of death. Yes.

**Speaker B:** Alex. Sorry.

**Speaker A:** Guys.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I get all that. Dhammarato, you didn't answer the question, my.

**Speaker A:** Friend. You mean with Dan? I thought that he was indicating that— go ahead, restate it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no, no, you're fine. I was just being a little hard-ass with you. Sorry. But no, Dan was— he said like, it's a tragedy if we identify as a body. It's a tragedy to die if we identify as a body. But if we identify as the awareness, which there is a body, in which there is an Alex, then, you know, that's a much greater and freer condition to live from. I was curious if you could talk about that specific condition that he's referring to and how the Eightfold Noble Path and how the teachings of the Buddha relate to that condition.

**Speaker A:** Okay. That in fact I think is what you're pointing at here, is that we are not the body, we are not the feelings, we are not our memories. And then he goes, we're not even our perception, which is where most people come from. And then the big dude is consciousness. We see that being alive means being conscious. That it's not the body, it's the consciousness. And so uploading all of that data to the AI is not going to upload consciousness, it's just going to upload data. Now, the Buddha talks about consciousness as a nutriment, just like food. Okay, there's various different kinds of nutriments or nourishments that we get, and one of the nourishments— and this, by the way, was not a teaching of the Buddha, this was old, old philosophy from the Brahmins and the Vedas and all of that way back when— is that consciousness is a nourishment. Without consciousness, what is life.

**Speaker B:** Itself?

**Speaker A:** If you're not conscious, you're not alive. Yeah, right. That consciousness is a nutriment for life itself, just like food. And so while you're eating that food, it's going to keep you alive, but if you don't know it, then what difference does it make? It's that knowing, it's that seeing, it's that taking in data. And that that is in fact what can be celebrated, is that we are still alive, which means we still have that consciousness. Now the teaching of the Buddha is that consciousness is not permanent, it's temporary. Consciousness dependently arises, that in fact when you stump your toe, you're probably not conscious of much of anything else. Or for the man, when you get strongly hit in the balls, you're not conscious of anything.

**Speaker C:** Else.

**Speaker B:** But in fact, of the pain though—.

**Speaker A:** Well, yes, but that's the whole point, is you're not conscious of anything else because that pain is so great. We're not even— here's an example of that, that I saw. This is one of those shorts on YouTube. And that this guy was on a trampoline that was beside a wall that had a roof that they were using to jump off the roof onto the trampoline and then make it back up to the roof and land again. And this was the show. And this guy, his girlfriend accidentally hit him in the balls for some reason as he was coming back up. And he lost it. I mean, he couldn't do anything else. He was just doubled up in pain while that trampoline was going up and down, and he couldn't do anything else. Okay, so this is what I'm referring to, is that the whole quality of the teaching of the Buddha is to wake up that consciousness so that it can be more generalized. That we don't focus down on one little thing to miss everything else, that consciousness is dependently arising. Let us use that, in fact, as a skill to be developed. The skill is to keep coming back to reality, to come back to the consciousness. But we are taught in our society to say, "Who am I?" is the body. Look how many industries are set up. I mean, the entire cosmetic industry, the fashion industry, much of what automobiles are all about is ego, about I am this car, this car is fancy, therefore I own it, I'm fancy too. You know, that's the whole idea. They've got all of these wealth people with Lamborghinis that have just been to the car show. You know, that kind of thing. And so we identify with physical objects like the body. I am the body. And Dan was, I think, pointing at the fact that this is what terrifies us so much, is because the body is temporary too, and that it gets sick, it gets well, it gets tired, it gets, you know, hungry. All of these problems with the body And so we identify I am the body. And this is then part of the reason why we stay victims. When we recognize that I am not the body, that I am, in fact, if anything close, it's consciousness to stay alert, to stay awake, to be alive.

**Speaker B:** It's like that sounds like quite a relief. Compared to being identified with the body. Because I mean, if you're identified with the body, it's.

**Speaker A:** Temporary.

**Speaker B:** You know, you're gonna die. But if you identify with.

**Speaker C:** Consciousness, I.

**Speaker B:** Don'T— I can't even imagine what that's like. I probably can't.

**Speaker C:** You know, one thing that happened to me recently, today I was walking home and I had one thing or another on the mind, and there's always this dog, this pit bull behind this gate, and every time you walk by, he barks, you know, as aggressively as he can. And I normally just laugh or, you know, just watch him do his thing. But this time, because I was so closed off to what was going on, and he started barking out of nowhere right next to me. And I thought it was out of nowhere, but if I had been paying attention, then it wouldn't have been out of nowhere, and I wouldn't have been caught off.

**Speaker A:** Guard. Here's something that you can play with, that you possibly go by this place often where the dog is, and he's very aggressive to everybody because everybody doesn't like being barked at. So nobody likes that dog. So in a way, it's a— it's a Samsara cycle. He barks, they don't like it, they treat him bad, and he feels bad, so he keeps barking. All right. So what I would suggest is have a different attitude as you walk by the dog over and over again. But in fact, as you approach the place, you could maybe start singing. Whistling or doing something in a happy way to let the dog know, and start experimenting to see if you can in fact pass by that dog without the dog being so ferocious, but instead he may become friendly to you over time.

**Speaker B:** That sounds like an awesome experiment.

**Speaker C:** That's a good experiment, because then I'll be the only person on the block who could walk by the dog without without him.

**Speaker A:** Barking? Well, perhaps acknowledging the dog in friendly— even when he's barking at you, you can say, hey, I know what you're doing. And, and so when we recognize that we are not the body then we have better choices, like the choice to be here now, the choice to really experience what's going on, and including to really experience our grief. A lot of people will grieve, but they really don't experience it very well, and so they're doomed to repeat it drips and drabs rather than fully experience that.

**Speaker B:** Grief.

**Speaker C:** Dhammarato, like I said, I've been doing a little too much late night action, so I'm gonna go ahead and call it a night. But I really want to be on. I think I'm gonna join tomorrow evening in the open Sangha call.

**Speaker A:** Oh, I'd love to see you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I know you've been busy and I'm Glad to see you back, Keyshawn.

**Speaker C:** Yes, that's what I'm really looking forward to right now. So, can I.

**Speaker B:** Rest?

**Speaker A:** Well, Alex, I'm really pleased that you're doing as well as you're doing, and that this is not only that for you, but this is really good I, I use the word piggyback. Do you know what I mean by the word piggyback? Okay, so a lot of people are—.

**Speaker B:** I just wanted to say bye to Keishon too.

**Speaker A:** Sorry.

**Speaker B:** Yes, thanks, Keishon. It was good talking with you tonight, and we'll hang next weekend.

**Speaker A:** All right, bro. Yes, that's what I was about to say, that Keishon has been getting very good, uh, vibes off of this conversation that we're having. And that others are too, that this is actually a good thing. So thank you, Alex, for sharing your trip with your dad, because Kishan's going to be doing that too, and this is a good training for him.

**Speaker B:** That's awesome. That's great. I'm happy to hear that, guys.

**Speaker C:** I love a good piggyback ride. Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Alex. Anytime.

**Speaker A:** Bro. Okay, well, Alex, is there anything else that you and I need to talk about now?

**Speaker B:** Well, I was just curious if we could kind of keep— I really enjoyed this conversation about, you know, I think the important thing for me, the only reason why— okay, Dhammarato, the reason why you and I are speaking on the phone is because my— I'm gonna, for the lack of a better term, when I say goal, my goal is to, uh, understand completely what exactly I am so that I am not getting caught up in suffering, resistance, problems, creating my own problems, creating others' problems. And so that I really am— it's just like what all the great spiritual teachers say, like you merge with the universe, you are reality itself. There's nothing more important to me than that. So, and, and not in the Western way, okay? I know, I understand. I'm just, I'm just letting you know, that's why I'm here. I'm, I'm not, I'm not here to just like be happy, you know? Being happy is great, but I, I want the, I want the.

**Speaker A:** Truth. How about happy and fulfilled? There you go, there you go.

**Speaker B:** Okay, that's good. Okay, I like that, I like that.

**Speaker A:** I like that a lot. Right, not just fulfilled but wealthy with fulfillment.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, uh, overflowing. So one point to make Sounds good to me. One point to make is that according to the teachings of the Buddha and everything that I see, is that that old philosophical question that just permeates all of the oldest of literature— know thyself. To figure out the answer to that age-old question of, "Who am I?" And the Buddha talks about it in the sense that that kind of question is irrelevant. Why is it irrelevant? It's because mostly, we're a moving target, that we can only find out what we are, or who we are, if in fact we can stop time and take a photograph and then later study that photograph. But in fact, you're not a photograph, you're a movie. And we cannot in fact investigate all of the things there because they're in and out, they're up and down, they're moving. That you're a moving.

**Speaker B:** Target.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And when we recognize that, then we can say, okay, I may not ever figure out who I am, but I can figure out a whole lot of stuff about what I'm not, because I've got choices about what I'm not. And what I'm not— grief, grieving, angry, sad. I can feel the way that I want to feel, but still I don't feel one thing all the time. That too changes. Everything changes. And so when we can recognize that, then you got a much better handle over who you actually are is because you've got a choice about it right here, right now, to either be this or to be that right now. But the fact is, there's no time. You're a moving target. You'll never figure it out. I think, in fact, we've talked about this before. Sit down and write out a long, long list. Take an hour or two and define everything about you. And then set that piece of paper down, and a week later do that same experiment again. And that second time that we do it, we will oftentimes try to remember what I put down on the paper the first time rather than experiencing who.

**Speaker B:** I am right now. That's a really good experiment.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And then we wind up recognizing that we are not what we wrote down on that piece of paper because we're moving, we're changing, that we're not the same thing over and over again. And that in fact, the whole concept of the Christian soul is trying to specify and define who you are, which is what we would call personality. Who am I? I'm a personality. Well, guess what? The personality is constantly fluid. It's not the same. And the best part of that teaching is that we can change. We can change. It's not that we have to change or that we're constantly already changing. It's that we have choice about it. But if we think that we know who we are, then that defines us and we can't change. Now, over time, we can see— let's use Henry Ford and Bill Gates and Vanderbilt and many, many others that were the robber barons and the biggest thieves in town in their lifetime, like Bill Gates and Microsoft. Some of the dirty stories that I've heard about Bill Gates from, uh, for the way that he worked with IBM and other things like that. But he is not that person anymore. Now Bill Gates is a philanthropist. He could not have been a philanthropist if he had not been an Anicca, because the money that he's giving away is the money that he, uh, let us say, uh, stole a little bit from everybody who bought Windows. So the point is, is that he's made a major change in his life. And not only that, but he's probably a whole lot happier now that he's a philanthropist than he is the CEO of Microsoft. So we can't define who we are. We'll never be able to do that exactly. Probably about the best that we'll ever do is maybe 50 or 60%, but why bother? The better thing to do is to recognize I've got a choice right now about who I am.

**Speaker B:** Well, I actually didn't mean who you are, I meant what, what I am, because if we are awareness That's not a who, right? That's a what.

**Speaker A:** Okay. If what we are is consciousness. Yeah. Yeah. What you are is consciousness. What you are is none of the things that we thought that we were.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So would you agree then that if what we are is consciousness, but we don't experience ourselves as that, or technically you could say consciousness isn't experiencing itself.

**Speaker A:** As that right now. Exactly.

**Speaker B:** And it has decided to play the role of Alex and assume that it loves Alex so much that it has gotten lost inside Alex. And so it doesn't know whether it's consciousness or Alex anymore. How do you— I mean, wouldn't you say then that the realization of consciousness being awake to itself, isn't that the whole point, if there's any point at all?

**Speaker A:** Well, yes, I would say that that's correct, but there's a better way to express it. Okay, tell me. Okay, that mostly what we are is how we perceive the world. In other words, it's our own interpretation of the world based upon the input that we're getting now, plus our old past experiences. This is what is perception, and that the world that we live in is a perceived.

**Speaker B:** World.

**Speaker A:** So, what we're practicing here, working, let us say, both in the realm of Paticcasamuppada, where we're talking about, as well as the mind that is in a state where we can see it, is that we can begin to modify and play with the perception so as to stop it. In other words, we're stopped trying to make sense out of the world and just experiencing the world, to stay in consciousness rather than trying to make sense out of it. And when you're getting.

**Speaker B:** Into Jhana and things like this, you're closer to consciousness there than you are when you are off thinking about wanting to do something else because you're not satisfied where you are right now.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. So we're not conscious of right where we are right now. We're in some sort of dream state. But that also takes a bit of consciousness to be conscious of that dream state. But it's still not in our real senses— the eyes, the ears, the body, the touch, the sensations, the smells, the taste of food, et cetera, like that. Those things are real. Remembering my grandfather's coffin as it passes by, and my mommy holding my hand and squeezing it really tightly when that happened, that's just a memory. It's not real, cannot be reconstructed. That in fact, most likely that church has been destroyed, demolished, because we're talking about something that happened something years ago. And so I couldn't go back and revisit that church, and if I could, I couldn't reproduce the casket or the dead body or any of the people who were in that room. That was— that's gone. And the only thing that's left is the residual part of it that's in the mind, as opposed to right here, right now. I live in a reality that would take me far too long to explain it. Or to express it, but it has to do with the sunlight and the porch and the smells and the wind and the dogs and the chair that is here and all of this stuff that we can become aware of or conscious of in reality. And it's quite marvelous to just experience what's actually real. And that's what it is to be alive. To be alive is to experience the present moment. And to be thinking about something is not that kind of aliveness.

**Speaker B:** And so the reason why we say 'glad in the mind' is so that we can grow closer to the present moment.

**Speaker A:** To grow closer to the present moment, the reality of the situation, that we can become vibrantly alive.

**Speaker B:** So getting into joy, so to speak, like when we talk about gladdening the mind, that's kind of like the training wheels of the actual bike of living inside the experience, right? The training wheels of Jhana, they help you get closer to just the sensations, to appreciating the sensations as they are, because you've convinced yourself that there's nothing better than this.

**Speaker A:** Because this is the nourishment, this is in fact the nourishment of being alive, is being conscious, being awake, looking at and experiencing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so that's cool, that's cool. I think I'm beginning to knock on that.

**Speaker A:** Door. Begin to feel wealthy with it. Begin to appreciate how wealthy you are with consciousness already.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right, absolutely.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, even while you're knocking on the door, you've got a knock, you've got a fist, you've got power, you've got all of that stuff mentally that you're talking about. But the actual knocking on the door is still that you're alive. Yeah, I mean, of all of the bricks and all of the stones and all of the drops of water in the ocean and everything like that, it's not conscious that we have a marvelous gift of being alive. And your dad's death and other situations like that brings that up poignantly. That we're alive and we're not going to be alive. We're going to die. Let's celebrate what we've got now.

**Speaker B:** And how is it the case though that people say, like Dan has even said, like, you don't— you technically don't die. We are eternal. We don't die.

**Speaker A:** Well, actually, if we are consciousness in itself, then consciousness will go on. May not be my consciousness, but that's what we're celebrating, is consciousness itself. Remember, the distinction is, are we going to do this little old me selfishness, or are we going to be the expansion of life itself, consciousness.

**Speaker C:** Itself.

**Speaker A:** To get a load of the fact that we live in a world that's vibrantly alive.

**Speaker B:** And so there, from there, it's kind of easier to die because you're like, oh, okay, well, time for consciousness to.

**Speaker A:** Live on, you know? Exactly. I've had about as much joy as I can stand.

**Speaker B:** It's good.

**Speaker A:** And so we— and, and so we get kind of get the attitude of, you know something, there's a couple of things that I haven't done that— you've heard of a bucket list? How many bucket lists have dying on their bucket list? That's the only thing that I need to do now. I mean, talk about travel. I've travel. Talk about being in airplanes, I've done that too. The only thing that I haven't done yet is dying. I'm really interested in it, very curious about it.

**Speaker B:** I'm curious.

**Speaker A:** I want to be ready for it.

**Speaker B:** Um, I think it was, uh, I can't remember if it was Krishnamurti or Ram Dass, but they said that, um, we're all We're all going to die, but the real art is to learn to die before you die.

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm. Which is then that part again back to the selfishness. It's the selfishness, the self that dies, and then death itself has no sting, it has no pain. But when I want to avoid it because I want to live, that's where all the pain and suffering comes from, is.

**Speaker C:** Selfishness.

**Speaker A:** Wow.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, identifying with something that is mine—.

**Speaker A:** I, me, and mine— my death rather than death itself, or life itself, or the bigger.

**Speaker B:** Picture.

**Speaker A:** An example would be human, that we're human. Humanity is capable of great things, but humanity is also capable of great.

**Speaker C:** Screw-Ups.

**Speaker A:** But that just makes us.

**Speaker B:** Real.

**Speaker A:** There's no such thing as a perfect humanity, and yet in our society we're trying to strive for something that's not possible. Just like trying to strive for longevity, which is not possible. So instead of grasping and clinging and seeking the things that are not possible, It's better for us to enjoy the things that are real here now, not just possible, but basically pulling on our string and saying, wakey wakey, wake up! Reality is here and you're all dreaming about something that's impossible.

**Speaker B:** Wow. So it's crazy. Like, I feel so overflooded by my senses right now. I'm like, I am like surfing on, like, on the waters of stillness. Right now. And I just, I feel.

**Speaker A:** Incredible. Well, that's what we're looking for. That's the kind of— with words, I'm painting a picture of a state of being. Congratulations that I'm able to give that concept and you're able to convert it out of a concept into an.

**Speaker B:** Experience.

**Speaker A:** The experience of being alive. And guess what? It's almost overwhelming. In the suttas, they talk about it as being a flood, a flood of reality. Reality is really, really complicated. There's a lot to it, and we don't pay much attention to that.

**Speaker B:** Yes, this is, this is what I Seriously, this is similar to what I feel when I take psychedelics, when I take.

**Speaker A:** Shrooms. Well, what those things do is they kind of break down all of those boundaries and barriers that we have built up to protect the self, right?

**Speaker B:** Right, to reality. All the boundaries that we've made to reality.

**Speaker A:** And those boundaries keep us in our territory rather than experimenting and exploring with the fact that we've got an entire universe here. I don't have to go anywhere. I don't have to go to Detroit to find the universe. It's right.

**Speaker B:** Here.

**Speaker A:** We don't have to go any place to do anything. It's all right here. It's already here. And being temporary helps us to.

**Speaker B:** Appreciate, right?

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** It's not two, it's.

**Speaker A:** One.

**Speaker B:** Yes, we need death in order to appreciate.

**Speaker C:** It.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's that distinction then, between selfishness is small and it's multiplicity, it's all over the place. But altruism is unification. We're all alike. You and I are brothers. There's no distinction. We both have that one thing in common, and that is that we're alive. And that life itself, that's the miracle—to being alive, to being able to be receptive, to be conscious of how complex things are. How marvelous it.

**Speaker B:** Is.

**Speaker A:** This is incredible. You talked about it also in this term of.

**Speaker C:** Psychedelics.

**Speaker A:** But there's another way of expressing it, and that is being in love. You've heard songs like, "It's a big, wide, wonderful world we live in," when you're in love. But normally when we're in love, we think about it in a small, selfish way, in love with that girl or in love with this dog, or in love with this car, or whatever it is. And here we're taking that sense of being in love and expanding it to everything. Being in love with being alive, being in love with reality. To bring that joy up. Oh, this is so good! And why aren't we? I mean, we could be born and lived like that our whole lives, but our society has trained us into being very selfish.

**Speaker C:** Protectionistic.

**Speaker A:** And so we have to train ourselves from the small into the big, from the self into the.

**Speaker B:** All. How does that work with like if you're looking at different jobs and stuff? And you know, like in my case, I've been looking at different jobs. You know, in some cases it may benefit, it may benefit people for me to stay in my job. So my depriving the All from its total possible benefit by jumping ship and going into another field?

**Speaker A:** Right. Well, here's the point. When you're jumping the ship, know that this is what's happening. Know the ship and the jumping. That if you do take another job, know that. But if you don't and you stay in the job that you've got here, know that too, to stay in the reality. But what you're doing here is, in that moment, is, should I— this little self, this selfishness— should I go and take that little job, or should I take this little job, or do this little thing? And the answer to that is, wakey wakey, we've got a great big world here if we could experience it. And in that regard, it doesn't matter what job that you're doing at all. What matters is how are you doing that job in this present moment? Are you aware of how big things are right now, how wonderful things are? And if you take that kind of attitude with you, with the people that you talk to on the phone, they'll get that from.

**Speaker B:** You. You're absolutely right. Yeah, you're absolutely.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** Wow. Wow. So I think this is what I'm seeing here, that when I am just resting as the senses, But I wouldn't even say that's a way to describe it, but it's actually even not that. It's hard to describe what it actually is, but that's the closest I guess I could say when you're resting and kind of just like getting cozy in the senses, like getting completely consumed, subsumed, and subsumed by the senses, and it's just delicious. That right there is just experiencing reality as it is. It's not anything you're manufacturing or creating. It's right there to be.

**Speaker A:** Enjoyed. Yes, it is. There it is. Here it is. All we have to do is remember that we have a choice. Are we going to think small, or are we going to think big? Yeah, am I going to think about little old Alex, or I'm going to think about, wow, what a wonderful experience, uh, what a wonderful world Alex lives.

**Speaker B:** In, how wonderful it.

**Speaker A:** Is. And so your— the death of your dad actually can help trigger that for you.

**Speaker B:** Oh, it definitely has. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** To be here now, to be in the big wide wonderful world, to have fond memories of him, to love him rather than feeling miserable and regretful and guilty and shoulda, woulda, couldas, and I could have done this, that, and the other thing. No, the best thing to do is.

**Speaker B:** Just to love him. Yeah, and you know what's really interesting, Dhammarato, is when I think about guilt, when I think about the image of my dad being unconscious on the hospital bed, I get this image of regret, I guess you could say, of regret tinged with guilt. And what I just noticed is that image of regret and guilt is.

**Speaker A:** Based.

**Speaker B:** In an old Alex's memory, an old Alex's memory that occurred weeks ago now, 2 weeks.

**Speaker A:** Ago.

**Speaker B:** But that memory is only happening now because I'm remembering that memory. It's occurring, it's being made up in the mind in this moment.

**Speaker A:** In this moment.

**Speaker B:** Uh-huh. And it doesn't have to be, and it doesn't have to be seen as— it doesn't have to— I guess what I'm trying to say is that The Alex that's here now doesn't have to have the same memory that the old Alex had 2 weeks ago.

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly right. You could change. But this is a change model that you can change. Do you have a choice about how you feel when those memories come up? Yeah, and part of the change is, is to recognize that even though that's a memory, the reality is, is that this present moment is real. That's just a memory. And how you're feeling right now is real, and you have a choice over how you feel right now. That that memory doesn't define who you are or how you should feel. Got a choice, right? And the choice that I'm making right now is to congratulate you, Alex. I am just so overjoyed at the progress that you've made in the.

**Speaker B:** Dharma. Oh man, I don't know, Dhammarato. I might be fooling you.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, the central theme is **transforming grief and loss through Dhamma practice and shifting identification from the small self to expansive awareness.**

Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Problem: Conditioned Grief & Guilt**
*   The discussion begins with the observation that we often grieve because we are **socially conditioned** to do so ("we're supposed to grieve"), not solely from genuine loss.
*   A primary driver of painful grief is **guilt**—the "shoulda, woulda, couldas" and regrets about our past behavior toward the deceased.
*   Speaker A (Dhammarato) shares a childhood story of his mother grieving for a grandfather she disliked, highlighting how grief can be performative and guilt-based.

### **The Dhamma Solution: Mindful Re-framing**
*   Speaker B (Alex) shares his personal experience with his father's death as a practical example. Instead of being subdued by sadness, he **consciously celebrates** the love and connection: *"Love you, Dad. It's all good."*
*   This is framed as an application of **Sati (mindfulness)** and **Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing)**. The skill is to see unwholesome states (guilt, self-pity) and replace them with wholesome ones (gratitude, love).
*   The goal is not to suppress emotion, but to **meet it with a different perception**. When grief arises, one can acknowledge it and choose to frame it as an expression of love and a reminder of life's preciousness.

### **The Bigger Shift: From "Self" to "Awareness"**
*   The conversation deepens into a fundamental Dhamma insight: suffering arises from **identifying with the temporary self** (the body, personality, memories).
*   Alex references a friend's point: if you identify as the body (which dies), death is a tragedy. If you identify as the **awareness or consciousness** in which life and death occur, the experience is fundamentally different.
*   Dhammarato clarifies this is the choice between a **contracted, selfish view** ("poor me, my loss") and an **expansive, altruistic view**. The latter connects us to the universal experience of life and consciousness itself.

### **Death as a Teacher and the Beauty of Impermanence**
*   Alex reflects that his father's death became a **profound gift**—an intimate encounter with impermanence that awakened him to life.
*   Dhammarato argues that **death gives life meaning and beauty**. Impermanence (Anicca) is what makes art, music, and moments precious. The pathos of loss is part of the human capacity for beauty.
*   The practice is to use the reminder of death not to instill fear, but to **"celebrate that we're still alive"** and be fully present.

### **The Ultimate Goal: Living in Reality**
*   The talk concludes by connecting this to the ultimate aim of the path: ending suffering by **merging with the present-moment reality**.
*   Techniques like gladdening the mind and accessing meditative joy (Jhana) are "training wheels" to help settle the mind into simply **experiencing reality through the senses**.
*   The awakened state is described as being **"in love with being alive, in love with reality,"** where one feels overwhelmed by the richness of the present moment, free from the boundaries of the small self.

**In essence:** The talk guides the listener from seeing grief as an inevitable, passive suffering to seeing it as an opportunity for Dhamma practice. By applying mindfulness, one can transform grief from a guilt-ridden, self-centered experience into a conscious celebration of love and impermanence. This points toward the ultimate goal: shifting identification from the dying ego to the alive, aware presence that experiences the "big, wide, wonderful world" right now.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors and stories** to explore themes of grief, consciousness, identity, and the nature of life and death. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **1. Metaphors**
- **Life as a game**  
  Speaker A describes life as a game we are born into as “victims,” but through Dharma we can learn to be “winners.”

- **Grief as an obligation/expectation**  
  Grief is compared to a social script—something we’re “supposed to” or “expected to” feel, rather than an inevitable response.

- **Consciousness as a nutriment**  
  Like food, consciousness is framed as nourishment for being alive. Without it, “what is life itself?”

- **Self as a “moving target”**  
  Identity is not fixed; we are like a movie, not a photograph. We can’t be definitively defined because we are always changing.

- **The mind’s boundaries as walls**  
  Psychedelics are described as breaking down “boundaries and barriers that we have built up to protect the self,” allowing direct experience of reality.

- **Death as a “gift”**  
  Speaker B describes his father’s death as “one of the best gifts he could have ever given me”—a wake-up call to appreciate life and confront mortality.

- **Joy as “training wheels” for presence**  
  Gladdening the mind (through practices like *ānāpānasati*) is compared to training wheels that help us approach direct experience (Jhāna).

- **Reality as a “flood”**  
  Fully experiencing the present is described as a “flood of reality”—overwhelmingly rich and complex.

---

### **2. Stories & Anecdotes**
- **The grandfather’s funeral**  
  Speaker A recalls being 6 years old at his grandfather’s funeral, noticing his mother’s intense grief despite her dislike for him. This illustrates how grief can be performative or guilt-driven rather than purely about loss.

- **The friend who moved away**  
  Speaker A tells of a childhood friend, Keith, who moved away when he was 5. He felt genuine loss but without the guilt that often accompanies death—highlighting the difference between separation and death.

- **The puppy’s death**  
  Mentioned as an example of guilt (“I should have taken that puppy to the vet”)—showing how guilt attaches to death in a way it doesn’t to mere absence.

- **The aggressive dog**  
  Speaker C shares a story about a barking pit bull, used to discuss how our perception and attitude can change our experience (e.g., responding with friendliness instead of irritation).

- **Historical & cultural references**  
  - **Ponce de León** searching for the Fountain of Youth (in both Florida and South America).  
  - **Cryogenics** and **AI consciousness-uploading** as modern attempts to cheat death.  
  - **Bill Gates’ transformation** from “robber baron” to philanthropist, illustrating personal change and non-fixed identity.

- **Music and art examples**  
  Speaker A references classical compositions (Tchaikovsky’s *Pathétique*, Beethoven’s *Ode to Joy*, Schubert’s *Unfinished Symphony*) and the *Mona Lisa* to show how beauty is intensified by impermanence, age, and loss.

- **The trampoline accident**  
  A YouTube short where a man gets hit in the groin and loses all broader awareness—used to illustrate how intense pain narrows consciousness.

---

### **3. Recurring Symbolic Contrasts**
- **Selfish (small) vs. Altruistic (big) view**  
  Identifying with the individual body/ego (“little old me”) versus identifying with consciousness or life itself (“the All”).

- **Body vs. Consciousness**  
  The body is temporary and dies; consciousness (awareness) is what experiences life and can be celebrated as eternal in a universal sense.

- **Guilt vs. Celebration**  
  Approaching death with regret versus seeing it as an opportunity for gratitude and love.

- **Thinking vs. Experiencing**  
  Being lost in thought/memory versus being fully present in sensory reality.

---

These metaphors and stories collectively build a narrative that challenges conventional views on grief and identity, pointing toward a more mindful, present-centered, and expansive way of engaging with life and death.
