### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Me lately, I guess. I'm not having fun with it. I'm not having fun with it at all.

**Speaker B:** Well, one of the things that I have been reading just recently is about when people are not getting any good success, that some teachers will recommend to meditate harder, to meditate longer. Yeah, but that's not actually the practice. I think that that's the way that Westerners tend to think of it, is practice longer, practice harder, in the sense of do your homework longer. Do it harder, struggle at it. And that's very much part of Western lifestyle mentality, where what we're practicing here is to do it easy but do it more often, in the sense of remember to look at the kind of thoughts that you have and to make a change to it. Yeah, over and over and over again. Keep doing that. Keep remembering that you're okay already. Keep remembering that everything really is all right. Keep remembering that you can, in this moment, be satisfied. Everything is all right. Everything is fine and not a problem in the world. And then we'll think about something out there. We'll think about that homework, and then we'll start thinking about, oh, I got to get it done and whatnot like that. And the answer to that would be, in the style of the Buddha, is to remember to look at those thoughts and see them as not being all of that wholesome.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's not wholesome at all.

**Speaker B:** Go ahead.

**Speaker A:** No, I was just saying it's not wholesome at all. You're right. It's, you know, it's funny, like, you know, when I'm not looking, it's like, yeah, whatever. But when I really look, it's like, yeah, it's kind of disgusting. Like, why do I— why am I doing this to myself? Why am I telling myself all this story? Why am I telling myself all this? You know, it's hard. It's painful. I just don't see it. It's— yeah, I don't see it.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it is exactly painful, especially in the sense that now that we know the Four Noble Truths, now that we know that we can look and find and see this is Dukkha, it becomes disgusting. What we used to accept, what we used to do, what we used to thought was normal life now is seen as disgusting to think about doing stuff that is unnecessary to do.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** This is actually what's wrong with Western Buddhism, is that the people who are teaching are doing it because they are looking for money. They're looking for a livelihood, that they're not doing it because it's fun and enjoyable. They do it because it's coming from unwholesome thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so they're really not, uh, that's the problem I see with Western Buddhism is that nobody gets any real super mundane value and benefit out of it. Yeah, it's not liberating.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, people still think, uh, you know, you have to work for it. Uh, it— I mean, it's— I don't know, it's kind of funny. Uh, and even, even this, uh, this discussion right now really reminds me, yeah, I'm already okay. So quick to remember. You know, like, could I call you? I saw it happen so quickly, you know, like, it's like a flash of a second. I have a thought of like, oh, I need to start asking Dhammarato a question. I need Dhammarato to give me something that I don't know already. So, and then I saw it happen so quickly, and I was like, wait a minute, like, Like, let me just chill, let me just take a breath, I just want to talk, everything is okay. And it just happens so quickly, that part of me that's like screaming for help, it's so quick, so— I'm glad.

**Speaker B:** You'Re beginning to see that. The Buddha talks about that, he says the mind is fast, oh Bhikkhus, it's fast. The mind is so fast, he doesn't even have, in the Buddha's time, an analogy. Yeah, now we have seconds and microseconds and nanoseconds and all of that kind of stuff, but that kind of misses the point. Yeah, what's fast is that the mind will have a thought and drag us down into feelings, drag us down into attitudes, or in fact The underlying attitude is where those thoughts come from, those underlying tendencies, and that they pop up immediately. And if we can't remember that, we're going to be watching for that stuff and it'll grab us and off we go into our, um, misery trip.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** This is why we have to continue to remember to practice.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, sometimes I think about like, it's almost like I'm in the bus and it's going very fast or going very slow, whatever, and actually the ones that are driving the bus, there's no one driving. Like I'm the passenger and I can make the change, right? Like, it doesn't have to— I don't know, it's an incomplete thought process. This is something— sorry, Dhammarato, someone called me. Someone called me. Sorry, I lost my train of thought. But yeah, basically I was thinking like, I see it happened this morning, like I had very unwholesome thoughts. About going to some of my old habits, and I see it happening, and it's like in that moment I have a very detached reaction to it. It's like I will say, yeah, it's okay, there's no need to do that. I don't know, sometimes it doesn't feel sticky, you know, sometimes it feels Sometimes it doesn't feel sticky. I don't know, like sometimes it feels really sticky, but sometimes it's like I can just, just like, you know, it's almost like I don't have to do anything, you know. It's almost like it just bounces away because I see it. But sometimes really sticky. So I don't know, I guess that's the part where I'm frustrated about, like, why is, why is it sometimes I need so much effort, sometimes it's so easy? I don't know.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, now here's the answer. That is, it's easy when you're remembering to practice, and it's hard when you don't remember to practice. Now, here's really the most important point, is calling it hard is an unwholesome thought, and we don't remember to see it. So anytime that you think that it's hard, that's just because you at that particular instant didn't remember that, oh, this is hard. It's just another unwholesome thought. It really is never the issue of whether now is easy and now it's hard, but rather can you see those thoughts? Oh, it's hard now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and it's hard because you want something that you don't have.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so all you have to do is just change it. I don't need that. It's, uh, I'm open to being hard. It's good hard. Sometimes I like it hard. Yeah, right now it's hard. Okay, with me it's hard. And start to play with hard.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true. Is personality and attitude the same thing? We always talk about the change of attitude, the attitude of I can do this. Uh, I was just thinking, is it the same thing? The personality view, or is it different?

**Speaker B:** Well, the personality view is always associated with me, but that's what a personality view is, is that I have a personality.

**Speaker A:** I see.

**Speaker B:** That's the personality view, is I have a personality. In reality, there is no such thing as a personality because there's no person there for that 'ality.' Reality is, you see, person-reality. No, there's nobody there. There is no personality. And when we have the view that there is a personality, that also says it's kind of been a permanent way of This is who I am, rather than recognizing that you're a moving target. Yeah, sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't, sometimes you're schizophrenic, sometimes you have emotional well-being, sometimes you're borderline, sometimes you're attention deficit disorder, sometimes we're post-traumatic stress disorder. And when we're feeling good, we're none of those things.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So your personality is not fixed. And when you see that the personality is not fixed, that means that there really is no personality, because the whole point about a personality is something that's fixed.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** This is who I am, or this is who you are, and you're not. Yeah. But you can change immediately as soon as you see that personality and say, aha, that's not me. I see that Mara as I see you, Mara, not me. When we see it as me, like it's hard for me, but when you can see that hardness, you can say, aha, I see you, Mr. Hard Mara. The hard is not me, the hard is just the thought.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And then you're liberated right then and there. And who are you liberated from? The you that is in that personality. The bondage is a permanent self, and the liberation is, no, I can change.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it makes a lot of sense. Yeah, like, so lately, lately there's something that's been— I'm laughing because it's like a mundane problem, but this mundane issue kind of gets in the way of my practice. Basically, it's just when it comes to sorting my life, trying to get my life together so I have time to practice, because it's been all over the place. I mean, I'm working for myself, so I have problems managing time, and I get caught up in this personality kind of feel of like, you know, schizophrenic. I mean, not like literally schizophrenia, but I'm just speaking metaphorically. Like, I get crazy sometimes and all this thing. And then like, I have this like story of like, I need to make sure like I have a quote-unquote stable life so I can practice. And I'm not sure my question here, it's just I know on some level I'm making it complicated for myself. I'm telling myself to get something, and I don't know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we make it hard, we make it complicated. Exactly. Yeah. And when you see the complication, you can say, aha, I see that complication. Yeah, I am not the complication, it's just the thought. Yeah, yeah, you are not your thoughts. All the complication is just a thought.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And you can say, aha, I see you, complication.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And that immediately makes it easy and enjoyable.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, true. It's just I have, I have the tendency is say, oh, want to make sure it's right. And that's delusional. I can't make it right. I can only just do what I can do. Uh, I mean, it's just this one moment at a time, right? It's just this, it's just this. And it's actually very easy when I see that, well, it's just this, it's just this. And yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I see it now, you know, I see it now, you know, I start, it's very funny, like I, maybe, you know, like I could, I forgot to get something done and then like maybe I procrastinate or whatever and then I start to feel bad and then, and then say, oh, why am I always like this when actually the right change is, okay, let's do it now, you know, it's actually very that simple, just hey, just do it now.

**Speaker B:** And you can forget it now. But you said, in fact, this is the point, you said, why am I always like that? And the answer is, you're not. You're not always like that. That's just the thought.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Why am I always like that? That's just the thought.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And you say, aha, I see that thought.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I see that.

**Speaker B:** You're not the thought. I see that thought. So when you say, oh, it's complicated, oh, it's hard, oh, it's always like that, those are the things that determine a personality. When you can see it directly that you're not that personality, you have choices. And the choice is to laugh at— aha, I see you, Mara. Aha, I see you, Mr. Always. That's a good one for you. Yeah, whenever you have the word always, make that a cue word. Yeah, yeah, it's got a pin in it. Yeah, so when you see the word always, you can say, aha, I see that always word. Things are not always. In fact, the Buddha doesn't teach always. He teaches Anicca. Things are always changing. Always. Did you catch that one?

**Speaker A:** Something Arhat said, really, I keep thinking about it sometimes, like the Buddha is still alive. He said like, if you see Anicca, bow down to that. That's the Buddha right there. And that is really true. I find it enjoyable to pay attention to the world around me, you know, like I see the tree that's slowly dying, as I remember, oh, I need Anicca, and I see something that's growing that I never saw before, or Anicca, and it's like, yeah, yeah. I don't know why, it's just funny, this part of me that thinks things are permanent, so blind to it, you know, like just so not paying attention, not paying attention at all. Uh, yeah, but well.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there's, there's another way of looking at it. One would be to not pay attention to that stuff, but in the way that we're practicing, no, you want to pay attention to that always. You want to pay attention to it's hard, you want to pay attention to it's complicated. They are. Yeah, we want to see that that stuff is not true, so we want to pay attention to it and then make a change to it, see it like it really is.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, I— one of the way I— the practice over here has been shifting, uh, ever since I talked to you was So I stopped seeing things that deep, you know, like I kind of have a lot of fun just enjoying the breathing, enjoying this moment, and really just being in satisfaction. And a lot of the time it feels like the things that I'm being suppressing or the difficult, it kind of just come up by itself. I don't know, I think what I'm trying to say is my personal insight is a lot of things are not that deep. But I don't know, like, isn't— actually, this is the thing I'm kind of confused about. Like, some people talk about the Four Noble Truths as in like investigating the Dukkha. I mean, like seeing the root of the Dukkha. Uh.

**Speaker B:** Maybe, maybe in a way it has no root. It has no root, but it has— it comes up right now. All right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So yeah, when you can see— when we say you can see the Dukkha, what that means is you can see that word always.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** You can see the word hard. You can see the word complicated. You can see those words in your thoughts. That's the Dukkha, because all of those words— yeah, always and hard and complicated— has a desire that goes along with it. You want something to be different than it really is. Yeah, and these are just old habits. They're not deep. They're just persistent. You can be persistent. So when those persistent thoughts come up, you can persistently see and say, aha, persistently, aha, I see you, Mr. Persistent Unwholesome Thought, Mr. Always. I can see you, Mr. Complicated. I can see you, Mr. Hard. And I'm okay now that I can see you. I'm all right. Mr. Hard can just be hard. I can have fun watching Mr. Hard.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, it makes a lot of sense. It's so obvious, but yeah, when you point it— yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** So be on guard. This is the whole point about being on guard, being mindful of those thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. Yeah, one thing I really appreciate about the practice is it's always been like, sometimes I don't want to sit, and sometimes it's like, I know I don't want to take a break, and it was up to me to change my attitude right there and then. It's like, hey, it's okay, I'm just hanging out with my breath, nothing much to it, this is really nice. It's that immediate change rather than pushing myself. No, you have to sit. No, you have to do this. It's like that shift is so helpful. And basically what you are telling me right now is also the same thing. It's catch that always. Oh, I always said, hey, it's all right. It's seeing that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I've been feeling sorry for myself for the past few days. I'm telling myself a story of, oh, this new me is clashing with the old me, and that makes it so heavy. Make it so like— yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** I mean, I make that stuff up.

**Speaker B:** That's really amazing that you call and phrased it that way. Feeling sorry for the self. Yeah, but there is no self, and so you're feeling sorry, it's just an old habit.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** And you see that feeling sorry— aha, I see you, Mr. Feeling Sorry. Yeah, haha, I can see you.

**Speaker A:** No, that makes sense. No, even right now I realize, actually, I was calling you to ask you a question about like when it comes to the mundane world, you know, finding careers and all that. I was have questions about greed, and I realized suddenly I kind of answered my own question here because I was trying to ask about planning, but I just realized there's a very subtlety there. Like, I can plan in a way that's wholesome, like I don't have to think too much about it. It's just, hey, I just have to do that and that. And there's a very heavy kind of planning that kind of goes into unwholesomeness, as in like really plotting and scheming and like wanting it something to be certain way. Like, yeah, that's a very— there's just a lot of greed in, in some kind of thinking. I don't know, like, like, but there's a certain kind of planning that's actually— I don't know, to me it's wholesome. Like, there's not much to it, just, okay, just this, just that. Yeah, I don't know, I'm seeing it, right?

**Speaker B:** Okay, so When you say hard, yeah, and the thought of hard there, it already has the built-in quality of wanting it to be different. That's why we chose the word hard. Yeah, we see things as complicated. The word complicated has the greed built right into it. That we want it to be separate.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right, so if we can see that word complicated, we can say, wait a minute, I see you. The word complicated is what makes it complicated. Yeah, the word complicated is what makes things complicated. And when you can see, aha, I see that word complicated, And we can laugh and say, wow, everything is just real, everything is just okay. It's only complicated because I called it complicated.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Uh, it's, yeah, like, it's, it's like doing algebra, like very complicated algebra, and I say, why is it so complicated? Isn't that right? Then, then I I want it to be simple, but in Anagami, I can't.

**Speaker B:** Because you don't like it. Yeah, you want to know, you want to understand. If you don't care whether you understand it or not, then it's not complicated.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, I don't have to. Yeah, I mean I see that, I see that part of me, that critical thinking part, you know, like I have to get it right, I have to. It's like, who cares if I know or not, like let me just, let me just, yeah.

**Speaker B:** You don't have to get it right, you just get it happy. I'm pleased and happy with the way that it is.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Oh man, but that's, that's actually correct practice. Thinking that it is complicated, thinking that it's hard, thinking that I've got to get it right— those are all practices of unwholesome thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** When you can say, aha, I don't have to get it right, aha, I just be happy, then you're getting it right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's true. Wow, it's so subtle, like this, this, this, I don't know, this craving, this Dukkha, it's so subtle, these hindrances. I don't see it until you point it out to me. Like even just now, an hour ago before this call, I was I was messaging Alexander. I was saying like, I feel like I have a split of self. I know I'm overthinking it, but I don't know what's happening. What's the wholesome change I can do right now? And then he said, like, thinking about you having a split self, all that is like thinking you're not okay when you are already okay. It's all simple. I was like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. This is—.

**Speaker B:** So we have to practice seeing those thoughts that tell us that we're not okay. And you've got quite a number of them now. We've got hard, we've got complicated, we've got always. Yeah, I've got to get it right. Yeah. So anytime any of those thoughts come up— aha, I see you, Mr. All I Gotta Get It Right. And I don't have to get it right, I just get it happy. Yeah, that's right practice. Getting it right is wrong practice. Right practice is just, I'm okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so I have one last quick question. It's Basically, I've been avoiding— this is my undoing. Yeah, I've been avoiding a client. I know I have to call him back and I don't know what to say. I see it now, I'm making it complicated. I'm telling myself like, oh, he's it's gonna scold me, it's gonna— there's a lot of fear and anxiety. It's like, yeah, I don't know.

**Speaker B:** And yet, as you know what I will say, you got to see that stuff too. See that stuff. Recognize there really is nothing to be afraid of. You're not missing out. When you're happy, you're not missing out on anything. When you're satisfied, you're not missing out on anything. The fear comes when the thoughts are there, I might miss out on something.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I mean, I don't know how to apologize while sounding happy, you know. Because I really do, I really was irresponsible. I didn't call him back for a few days, so I am being very irresponsible. Like, I don't know, like, just say I'm sorry. It's this very mundane kind of problem. I'm very bad. Yeah, I just did that. I was already judging myself by saying that. I don't know, when it comes to dealing with people, sometimes really good at it, you know. There are sometimes I'm surprised how good I am. Like, what was that?

**Speaker B:** Me?

**Speaker A:** I was You know, and sometimes, like right now, I just— yeah, that personality is that I can't do this.

**Speaker B:** Well, dealing with other people, yeah, you can either do it one of two ways. One is that you can get your own mind cleaned out. You can clean it out of and see that, aha, I'm making it hard. Aha. I'm making it complicated. Aha, I might miss out on something. Aha, I got to get it right. When you can clean that stuff out, then you recognize that when you're dealing with other people, you're dealing with them while they're trying to deal with that stuff. So the question is, are you going to deal with people who are dealing with that stuff? Are you going to deal with them while you've got that stuff too? And everybody is going to stand They're stuck because they're full of stuff. Or you can clean your mind out so that you don't have always, you don't have complicated, you don't have hard, you don't have get it right, you don't have get it, um, I'm missing out on something. You can in fact clean that stuff out, and then when you're dealing with other people, you recognize that they're dealing with that. They're not dealing with you. You're empty. They're dealing with their own stuff.

**Speaker A:** Oh, okay. Yeah, like, yeah, yeah, I never thought of it that way. Yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah, they're dealing with their stuff.

**Speaker B:** They think they're dealing with you, but there's no you there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, I'm trying to protect this cell which is empty, you know, like, like, no problem, I can just handle it, like there's nothing to protect, like I'm already okay, already safe. All right, yeah, okay.

**Speaker B:** All right, you go practice, you go practice seeing this stuff. Yeah, you can see it. You know you can see it. Sometimes you can see it. Keep looking. Notice when that stuff keeps coming back.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, it does keep coming back.

**Speaker B:** It keeps coming back. Can you see it? Aha, I see you come back.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** And you get good at seeing it when it comes back, then you can better deal with other people because they can't see it in their own mind when it comes back to them. They can't see it because they're not trained to look at it. So you train yourself to look, to observe, to pay attention, so that you can change it.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** And over a while it gets less and less, and even more of a while You don't have to see it anymore. You keep looking, but you don't find it. And now you begin to see the emptiness. Oh, Mr. Complicated, where are you? I haven't seen you for a while. Where are you? I don't see you anymore. Mr. Gotta Get It Right, where have you been?

**Speaker A:** I mean, when you put it that way, it's really funny.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, that's what the empty is. Empty is when you recognize that all that stuff that used to be there, not there now. Haha, it's not there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, I'm gonna do it. Yeah. Thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, let's finish now. You go, you go do it. You're in that state, you can do this.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I can. Thank you, Dhammarato. See you.

**Speaker B:** All right, bye-bye. Okay, well, we'll see you later. I really enjoy talking with you, Ivan. You're good, good student.

**Speaker A:** Thank you, Dhammarato. Bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) with a student (Speaker A), centers on a core, practical insight: **the direct and joyful application of the Buddha's teachings to unwholesome thoughts in the present moment.**

Here is a summary of the key themes and advice:

**1. The Core Misunderstanding of "Practice":**
*   The talk critiques a common Western approach to meditation as a grim, effortful struggle—"practice longer, practice harder." This is seen as missing the point.
*   **True practice is presented as "easy but more often":** a continuous, gentle remembering to observe your thoughts and change your attitude towards them.

**2. The Central Practice: "Aha, I See You, Mara"**
*   The heart of the teaching is a simple, moment-to-moment technique:
    *   **Identify:** Notice unwholesome thoughts as they arise (e.g., "This is hard," "It's complicated," "I always mess up," "I have to get it right").
    *   **Dis-identify:** Recognize that these are just conditioned thoughts, not "you" or reality. They are "Mara" (the personification of delusion) trying to trick you.
    *   **Change Attitude:** Smile at the thought, say "Aha, I see you, Mr. Hard," and let it go. Replace the craving within the thought ("I want this to be different") with the understanding, **"I am already okay. I can be satisfied right now."**

**3. Key Insights on Dukkha (Suffering) and Personality:**
*   **Dukkha is in the thought-words:** Suffering is located in the specific, repetitive words and narratives we tell ourselves ("hard," "complicated," "always"). These words contain implicit craving for things to be other than they are.
*   **There is no fixed personality:** The belief in a solid, flawed self ("I am the kind of person who...") is the "personality view" (*sakkaya-ditthi*), a fetter to be abandoned. You are a "moving target"; when you see a thought as "not me," you are liberated from it in that moment.

**4. The Result: From Struggle to Playful Observation**
*   The goal is not to grimly eradicate thoughts but to **change your relationship to them.** When you see them clearly, they often lose their power and "bounce away."
*   Frustration itself ("Why is this sometimes so hard?") is just another unwholesome thought to see and release.
*   Practice becomes **enjoyable and liberating**—like "hanging out with the breath" or playfully watching "Mr. Complicated" come and go.

**5. Application to Mundane Life:**
*   The technique is directly applied to the student's real-world anxieties: procrastination, avoiding a client call, career planning.
*   The advice is to "clean your own mind out" of these narratives. Then, when dealing with others, you realize **they are dealing with their own "stuff" (their Mara)**, not with a solid "you." There is nothing to defend because your well-being is not dependent on the situation.

**In essence, the talk teaches a path of light-touch, joyful mindfulness.** Liberation is found not in years of arduous struggle, but in the immediate, smiling recognition of unwholesome thoughts as impersonal, empty phenomena, thereby returning to the innate satisfaction and okay-ness available in the present moment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this dialogue, the speakers use several key metaphors and stories to illustrate their points about mindfulness, unwholesome thoughts, and the nature of the self. Here are the primary ones:

### 1. **The "Homework" or "Western Practice" Metaphor**
   - **Description:** Speaker B contrasts a genuine meditative practice with the Western approach of "practicing longer" and "practicing harder." This is likened to doing homework—a struggle, an obligation, and a forced effort.
   - **Purpose:** To highlight how true practice is about changing one's relationship to thoughts easily and often, rather than through grim determination.

### 2. **The "Fast Mind" Analogy**
   - **Description:** The mind is described as incredibly fast—faster than any modern measurement like nanoseconds. Thoughts arise and instantly pull us into feelings and attitudes.
   - **Purpose:** To emphasize the need for constant vigilance and quick recognition of unwholesome thoughts before they take over.

### 3. **The "Bus with No Driver" Metaphor**
   - **Description:** Speaker A describes feeling like a passenger on a bus (the mind/experience) that is going fast or slow, but with no one in control. The realization is that "I'm the passenger and I can make the change."
   - **Purpose:** To illustrate the possibility of shifting from a passive, carried-along state to an active, choice-making one, even if the initial feeling is of being out of control.

### 4. **The "Sticky" vs. "Non-Sticky" Thought Metaphor**
   - **Description:** Thoughts are described as sometimes being "sticky" (hard to detach from) and sometimes not sticky at all, bouncing away easily when seen.
   - **Purpose:** To explore the variable nature of mental hindrances and the role of awareness in making them less adhesive.

### 5. **The "Mara" Personification**
   - **Description:** Unwholesome thought patterns are personified as **"Mara"** (a Buddhist figure representing temptation, death, and obstruction) or given names like **"Mr. Hard," "Mr. Complicated," "Mr. Always,"** and **"Mr. Feeling Sorry."**
   - **Purpose:** To externalize and objectify negative mental habits. By saying "Aha, I see you, Mara," one creates detachment, seeing the thought as a separate, impermanent phenomenon, not as "self."

### 6. **The "Personality as a Fixed Story" Metaphor**
   - **Description:** The concept of a fixed personality is challenged. Speaker B describes it as a "permanent way" of thinking "This is who I am," whereas in reality, we are a "moving target" with changing states (sometimes feeling "like a nut," sometimes not).
   - **Purpose:** To deconstruct the view of a solid self and show that liberation comes from seeing personality traits as transient thoughts, not identity.

### 7. **The "Empty" or "Clean Mind" Metaphor**
   - **Description:** The goal of practice is described as cleaning the mind out, making it "empty" of the persistent, unwholesome thoughts. Emptiness here means the absence of those specific hindrances.
   - **Purpose:** To frame the practice as one of purification and simplification, leading to a state where one can interact with others without one's own "stuff" clouding the interaction.

### 8. **The "Algebra" Analogy**
   - **Description:** Speaker A compares dealing with complicated thoughts to doing "very complicated algebra." The complexity comes from the desire to understand and get it right.
   - **Purpose:** To show how the craving for certainty and correctness (*wanting it to be simple*) is what creates the experience of "complicated." Letting go of that craving dissolves the complexity.

### 9. **The "Tree" Story of Anicca (Impermanence)**
   - **Description:** Speaker A mentions observing a tree slowly dying and new things growing as a direct, enjoyable contemplation of impermanence (Anicca).
   - **Purpose:** To ground the abstract principle of impermanence in a tangible, observable story from daily life, showing how paying attention to change can be liberating.

### 10. **The "Dealing with Other People's Stuff" Metaphor**
    - **Description:** Speaker B explains that interpersonal difficulties occur when two people, each full of their own "stuff" (unwholesome thoughts), interact. If you clean out your own mind, you realize others are "dealing with their own stuff" and not really with "you," because there's no solid "you" there to be attacked.
    - **Purpose:** To reduce personalization and defensiveness in conflicts, framing them as interactions between mental habits rather than between solid selves.

**Overall Narrative Arc:** The conversation itself tells a **story of recognition and relief**. Speaker A begins frustrated, telling a "story" of struggle and a complicated self. Through dialogue, they identify the metaphorical "characters" (Mr. Hard, etc.) in their mind, learn to see them as separate, and move towards a simpler, more immediate practice of finding satisfaction in the present moment. The metaphors serve as tools to dismantle the unhelpful narratives the mind creates.
