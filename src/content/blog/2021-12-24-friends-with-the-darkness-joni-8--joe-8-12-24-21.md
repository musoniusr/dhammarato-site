### Transcript


**Speaker A:** about your retreat.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so I'm not sure what to say. It went well. I liked it. It was really fun. It was really nice to like see all the stuff that kind of comes up when one puts— when we put ourselves under, you know, I guess a process like that. I think the whole thing was like really nice. I liked it, I enjoyed it very much, made good friends by the last day and that sort of stuff. Really good, really fun. And yeah, then after that I went for 3 weeks back to my home country and spent some holidays there, so that was really nice too. And Yeah, I'm not sure. I don't think I have much like in specific or particular to talk about.

**Speaker A:** Well, one thing that I can say is that you're more prepared than most to do a Goenka retreat because most people don't enjoy it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, it wasn't easy, you know, like I guess like body pain all over the place and stuff like that. But then by the, like, the second, like, third day, maybe third day, I noticed that, like, uh, I don't know, it's almost like something clicked and like the pain just stopped being a problem entirely. Like, the pain was there just the same, but it was just not a problem, you know. I guess it's like the you know, like how pain is different from suffering. And there was pain, but there was no suffering derived from the pain. So that was very insightful, I guess. And yeah, so that was nice. Then I also had like visual hallucinations as I was like transitioning into like sleep. Or as I was taking like really short naps, like during that longer period of lunch or something like that. And yeah, I don't know what to make of that. I tried to not give it much attention.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And well, we can talk about that for just a little bit, those what you were calling visual hallucinations. Now, the way that I was introduced to this process was through the Bandler and Grinder's NLP. And I understood it as a concept, but then I began to see this when I later was more deeply into meditation. Okay. Or let us say more active in meditation or more frequent in meditation or something like that. So the point is, is that we all have visual hallucinations, but that those visual hallucinations are often very, very short and they last only about a mind moment. And sometimes those visual hallucinations are nothing but a color. Or a vague image. Sometimes it's something in motion. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** I was just saying that I've had colors appear before for short moments, and then I noticed it and I snap out of it out of fear. It has happened before, like, I don't know, many months ago, maybe even years ago.

**Speaker A:** That's interesting. That's very interesting. You snap out of it out of fear when in fact the mind has been doing that. And in In fact, that's a normal functioning of the human mind.

**Speaker B:** I see.

**Speaker A:** Yeah,

**Speaker B:** like these ones were different. It wasn't like colors, it was shapes. I want to say like geometric. So I had like these, I don't know how to describe, but like imagine like this is like a line, this is a pen. But imagine like I had lines coming from like the side of my field of vision and they were like coming like this and like this in a circular shape. And they kind of converge upon a circle. So like one converts here, then this line converts here and here and here. And they kind of like rotate slowly like this. And they make the most perfect circle I've ever seen in my whole life. And this wasn't This wasn't blurry or fuzzy or distorted, or it was very sharp, very precise, like, you know, like 4K, Full HD quality, like just like I'm seeing.

**Speaker A:** I understand when you're telling me this, it sounds a little bit like one of the scenes that is often done in the Star Wars movies when the Han Solo machine goes into hyper or warp or whatever high speed, and then the stars begin to shape, or they begin to elongate.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And, and, uh, and the conversion point is wherever the rocket ship is going. Um, but, um, uh, the, the point is, is yes, we do have these visual things that happen, and we use those as part of the thought process that we have, that, that, uh, that in fact a way of thinking of the Samskara or the way that even thinking of past or the way that even thinking of memory or any of that way of talking about it is, is that what we store and then pull back are only the same things that we have input with. In other words, a laptop or a PC The hard drive does not create— the hard drive itself does not create new data and put on the hard drive, right? The hard drive is only a storage mechanism, and the only thing that the storage mechanism does is to store input in various bits and pieces, okay? What means that is that when we think, we think the way that we receive input, which means that we think visually because we see and interpret things visually, that humans are actually quite visual to where dogs are much more olfactory. Their primary method seems to be odor, that in fact When a dog goes to look at something to inspect it, he always inspects it by sniffing it rather than by looking at it. A human will take and they'll do this. The dog will do that when we're trying to get something. This is an important quality to understand, that these visual things that are stored in the mind were stored because that's the kind of way that the mind works. We store visions, we store sound, but we don't store very well smells. We're not very olfactory oriented that way for some reason, our species. And it could be the fact that once we stood up and started walking around, now we're 4 to 6 feet above the ground for our nose to where the dog, he's got the ability to put his nose right to the ground. Which is basically odors are very heavy molecules, are distinct, and so they can fit in. But anyway, an example of that, for instance, is that it's hard for you to conjure up and remember what something smells like, but you can actually easily remember, for instance, what a lemon looks like. But it's a little bit hard to see what it smells like. We have to actually spend some time to recreate that. The same thing with a rose. It's easy to identify looking at a rose those that you can see it, but do you remember what it smells like?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So not only do we only store input, but we store it in this— in the kind of importance or value that we have as input devices. And so the visual inputs are actually— because we're so visually oriented, many times the visual construction are very, very quick. In other words, you can have a visual image of something, maybe a story, maybe a joke, and all you remember is just an image. But then it takes 3 or 4, maybe 30 seconds or a minute or so to tell the story that that image has. It's just a flash. You've heard things like that a picture is worth a thousand words. Actually, that's very conservative.

**Speaker B:** Very small.

**Speaker A:** Yes, nice old number. Exactly. But the point is, then we normally have a sequence of see, feel. Often we will also have a feel, describe or talk about it, and then feel. But one of the things that's important for us to understand is, is that we, we as humans are feeling beings and we're often driven by feelings about things rather than the actual object itself. In other words, if a child has never seen a wolf before, when he sees the wolf, he's not afraid of the wolf because he's got no Storage about connection about it. Yeah, those connections. Okay, so now we can actually, when I even use the word wolf, you probably created more than one image of a wolf in your mind.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I didn't know it. I actually didn't notice it as you said it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, Joe, did you notice that you actually created images of wolves in your mind and they were very fleeting? Very fast.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yes. That's the whole point, is that we begin to pick up and see that stuff happening kind of in real time and recognize instead of, oh no, look at that, it's also that's how the mind operates is a much better attitude. So we're basically beginning to change our attitude. Because in fact our attitudes are stored. And the kind of attitude that people normally have is the kind of attitude that's built up over time in the sense of a life script or the way that we do things. And so we store visual, we store audio, we store other sensations. For instance, if I use descriptions of certain sensations in the body like sharp, or throbbing. You know those words and you know actually the feelings that are associated with it, that there's a sharp piercing sensation is different than a dull aching. And the aching actually has to do with throbbing. And it normally throbs at the pulse of the heartbeat so that as the blood pressure comes up and down, the sensations will change. All right. And so we have these kinds of things also stored as part of the Samskara. And so this is going in directly into the level of what Joe's question was, is that sometimes because we've got an event coming up, that we will have a story that we're telling ourselves about the future event. It could be a date, it could be an interview. Review. It could be a job performance review. It can be getting your driver's license. It doesn't matter what it is, but what we do with that is that we attach importance to that thing. And then whoever it is that we're going to go deal with, we've also put them as an authority figure over us, that they've got something that we want. And so by having that kind of stuff stored in as advance, we can recognize that we don't have to deal with situations like that, that there's that. In fact, if you have any meeting or any appointment with anyone for any reason at all, then the best way to have thoughts about it is that We have thoughts with the intention of being friendly and enjoy the conversation. And that's all the planning that we need to do. But we get used to doing things, say, in high school, kids who study for a test by cramming will then later in life, when they go to have an interview, they will cram for that interview. And often their cramming time is full of, let us say, tension and anxiety, and they didn't need to know any of that stuff anyway, that there's a much better way to study for an exam, and that is sit in class and pay attention.

**Speaker C:** So can I jump in for a second?

**Speaker A:** Yes, go right ahead.

**Speaker C:** Okay, so I sort of realized this and I tried thinking friendly thoughts and I'm still trying to think friendly thoughts. And I, like, last night it was going pretty well. I was kind of meditating and was like trying to send friendly thoughts both to myself and to my thought of this person. And then It's like it just keeps coming back. It's like a constant internal negotiation that's going on is the one thing. And then the other thing is that sometimes when I actually have the interaction and I'm really friendly, I feel like I just get run over and that I'm just a pushover. And like in this specific interaction, like the last time that I interacted with him, I really was friendly and nice. And I just got sort of run over and didn't really— because I basically, I'm digging a pond and I need to get permission from a government official about it, and he very much takes his job seriously. And yeah, so anyways, that's just kind of that.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So he's the guy who's going to be giving you a permit to dig a pond. Is that— yeah, that's it.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. Uh, then in some ways you want to give him the feeling, or let him, uh, have the feeling that in fact he is in charge.

**Speaker C:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** because he's, uh, you know, he's got his own standards or ways of doing things and things like that, and he's going to give you the permit again. Uh, but if you've already met him before, then he's already spelled out what he wants from you, and the getting ready for the meeting is getting that stuff done, not thinking of the excuses that you're going to give him for not having done. That's another way of looking at it. Okay, so, uh, being well prepared for the meeting includes the point that the most important point about the meeting is that you're going to get along with this guy and make friends with him. That's the number one goal of the meeting, because if he feels good, he's going to give you what you want. And if he feels bad, even if you've, let us say, passed every step along the way and have done 100% of everything that he's required, if you do that and tick him off, you still got a problem, right?

**Speaker C:** Right.

**Speaker A:** But if you are in fact very friendly and courteous and agreeable with him, then even if you don't have 100% of all the stuff that he's asking for, you still have a good chance of getting it, right?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I mean, I have— I have everything that he's asking. I think he He's a little bit of an older gentleman, and I think he maybe just doesn't take me very seriously because I kind of look like— with my long hair and my beard and stuff, and I don't know. But yeah, I still can try to be nice though and try and convince him that I'm a serious person and that I'm not like, you know, messing around or something.

**Speaker A:** Are you sure? If that's the case, then maybe the pond that you're talking about is important enough to go to a barber shop and get a really good job done.

**Speaker C:** No, I don't think so.

**Speaker A:** Up to you. I mean, there's— but this whole idea is that if we dwell on— and not dwell, but in fact, the passing moments of past and future that you have would be the, oh no, I've got that meeting. Oh no, what's going to happen? Which is normally the way that a child will think of the meeting is because they come from the perspective of being a victim.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** The way that you can have it is when those thoughts of the meeting come up, you can have it. Yeah, I can handle that.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. There's going to be no, no issue to it.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. That we do have control over the way that we think when we remember to.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** This is what Sati is all about. If we can't remember, in other words, if we get stuck in the own, oh, I've got to deal with this guy and he's already run over me. Okay. You can see the attitude that comes with that. And so there's an attitude of aversion rather than the attitude of friendliness.

**Speaker C:** Right.

**Speaker A:** So dealing with him in your own mind in a friendly way before you deal with him actually is the habit that we want to start creating. If you were angry and upset thinking about him the day before it, then it's going to be more difficult to put down that anger and upsetness and then go deal with him. Okay. So

**Speaker C:** the thing I often— could I just say, I often do this with other things in life and I— it's like I notice it, but then it just stays for quite a long time. It just comes back and then it stays and like getting a real shift there and getting this sort of frustration that I have out or changing it, I find really difficult. It's easy when I don't have to deal with real world stuff, like what I consider, whatever my personality structure has decided is important. I just, I don't know why I still find it difficult because like practicing in other situations, it's quite easy and yeah, but then when I get into situations like, you know, this or interacting with, you know, in other situations, I really struggle and I don't know if that changes with practice or— So you— But it's been a lot of years of this.

**Speaker A:** So, so you've used two words, struggle and frustration. Yeah. Are those not the same thing?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, a little bit, I guess. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. All right. So one of the things that's kind of interesting about frustration is that there's a Catch-22. To it in the sense of the Catch-22 means that you can't get from here to there with frustration. In other words, frustration creates frustration. So if you're frustrated with your frustration, you're adding to it. Okay. Another way of thinking about it is like with a hook. All right. And the frustration is like being hooked. And then the struggle is to pull back and forth like this because you're struggling and you're pulling. All right. But the right way to unhook things is always to give it some slack. It doesn't matter whether this is a crane operator or whatever it is. If you've got a hook or a hoist, the only way to unhook something is by by giving it so much slack that is easily removed from the hook. This is also true with frustration. In other words, if you see frustration and you don't like frustration, you're going to continue to create frustration. If you have anxiety and you don't like the anxiety, the very thing of anxiety is that you're not liking something. So now whatever it was that you were not liking, they gave you anxiety. And now the meditator sees the anxiety. He doesn't like that, which is creating even more anxiety. This is quite typical, and every student has this. So remember that analogy. How are you going to unhook yourself? Are you going to just keep dragging and pulling the way that a child would? That in fact, children, they're easy to play games with, like tug of war. And this happens also in other things like that, is that you're— both of you are struggling and struggling and struggling and struggling and pulling and pulling. But what happens if the one who has got some wisdom completely lets go? Not— yeah, not let go of the rope or whatever that you're pulling, but letting go of the tension so that it becomes completely relaxed. All right. And that will then almost take the other person off balance so that now you can pull. Okay. This is also the way that we want to deal with frustration. Rather than struggling with it, that we're going to start playing a game with the frustration, because these frustrating feelings are just initially just old stored feelings in the sense that they're memories. You know what it's like to feel frustrated. You started feeling frustrated when you were a child, and now you've got quite a habit of it. And so the way that you deal with frustration is with frustration, which is typical. That's why people remain frustrated rather than letting go of it. Now, how do we let go? That's interesting. I mean, you can see the analogy that if I'm pulling on a rope with a child pulling on the other end, the easy thing is to let them get off balance by letting them have it and then pulling it back. This is exactly the entire art of jujitsu. You probably heard jujitsu. Okay. There's also another tradition that I'm more familiar with called Goju-ryu, and you can hear that 'ju' in there. That 'ju' is give. Okay, so we want to start playing with the mind the way that we would play jiu-jitsu, and that is to give into it to trip it up. So basically what jiu-jitsu is all about is merely standing out of the way and let that force go. So if somebody's trying to punch you in the nose, you just move your head like that and let force go like that, and then you can grab his arm and pull him off balance. So that's one of the ways that the jiu-jitsu operates. But we can use that because it's physics, but it's the physics of the mind. So how are we going to learn to deal with frustration? Well, we've talked about making friends with these things. We've talked about that in fact in the suttas, one of the— it's the fourth knowledge. The fourth knowledge is the knowledge that it is okay to see the Dukkha and to, let us say, make amends to it or reparations or repair. Or another word that we can use is rehabilitation. So we want to rehabilitate the frustrations. That's the way that we're going to deal with them, by giving them enough room. So another way of talking about it then is that if we can see the Dukkha clearly, then we know how to trip it up. But if we do not like the Dukkha and try to resist it and push it back, then it will just create more Dukkha, more frustration, more anxiety. Right. By fighting with it on the inside, you've got— now you're fighting with your own tension and anxiety. And this is very common. This is what we mean by frustration is because we don't see a way out. It doesn't matter how much we struggle or how hard we pull, we're still stuck with the same stuff. And what we need to do instead is give it some slack. And the way that we do that is instead of not liking it and trying to get rid of it and trying to resist it coming in this direction, we want to actually help it come in this direction. What is that? In the direction of let it be your friend. Invite it in. Allow yourself the time to really inspect it, to let it go in that way. But in fact, recently I've been using an analogy that comes in the form of a song. Have you ever heard of Simon and Garfunkel?

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And they had a song that was very famous called The Sound of Silence. Have you ever heard that song? I haven't heard that. The opening line of it is, hello darkness, my old friend, I've come to talk with you again. Surely you've heard those lines. Okay, now when I was a teenager and I heard that song, it sounded to me like that this teenager singing the song grabbed his guitar, went into his bedroom, and turned the lights out. And that's the darkness. He's trying to get away from it all. But there's a more sophisticated way of looking at it, and that is that the darkness is actually the parts of our own mind that we have not looked at because we don't like it. It's our darkness. Your frustration is your darkness. Yeah. Okay. And so we need to then take that analogy and start recognizing that the right way to deal with frustration is by treating it like an old friend when it comes, because it really is an old friend. You just didn't like it very much before. Yeah. Okay. So now the way to deal with frustration is by investigating it and see what it really is like. Is there any bodily component to the frustration? Like anxiety is often held in the chest, in the neck. Yes. The neck is also a favorite place. And then in fact, when the question arises, why does tension arise in the neck? The answer to that can be by asking another question. Why do the biggest, toughest lions have manes?

**Speaker C:** To protect the neck.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. To protect the neck. Okay. So the next question along that line would be, well, where do lions go for the kill? What is the kill, the attack kill? Not the jumping on the back kill, but the attack, the kill attack. Okay, that's the neck. So now you're saying that, oh, that's maybe the point that we can say about why do people have neck tension is because they're actually trying to protect. Okay, there's something dangerous there. And so when people have neck tension, that's just a physical manifestation of the that is already in the chemistry of the blood in the body, and that that chemistry was kicked off by the mind. But we often don't even remember because it was fleeting or whatever, and all we're left with is the telltale stuff that's in the body. There's a feeling of being set upon, feeling of frustration, to where those are just old familiar feelings, but we don't like them, but they are family. So the first thing that we need to do is to start treating them like family, like they are familiar, and let them become really familiar because we're really now investigating it to the depths. So just like going back to Goenka, just like Goenka recommends, because now we've talked about the underlying stuff that's going on with that. This is why in the meditation, the students are invited to really inspect the body, not just for sensations of the body, but also for the locations of the anxiety and the tensions and the frustrations and all of that kind of emotional stuff that is associated with the body. For instance, anger is not a merely mental thing. That when someone is angry, there will be physically physical components. One of them is, is that we will ball up our fist, we will tighten the neck, someone will suck in the gut. Other things like this will happen when we get angry. And what do we call that? Tense. In other words, we tense up the body, but it happens subconsciously, or it happens with a part of the mind that we're not paying attention to. So now, as a meditator, you're beginning to see that tension. You can say, hot dang, I see you finally. I see you, old friend. You've come to talk with me again, I see. And this time we're really going to listen. We're really going to pay attention to it. That's the way of dealing with the frustration, is to recognize that something will very happily fast can happen in the mind, that then, then almost like that there is a, let us say, a faucet in the brain, and that it takes that faucet, turns on adrenaline. It's done through the mechanism of the pineal and the pituitary glands that are in the back of the head, communicating directly with the adrenaline gland that is sitting on top of the kidneys in the back. Here. And so there's a direct connection between them. And so this stuff, by the way, happens very, very fast. It's intended to be fast. This is the high-speed reaction that keeps you alive sometimes, and that was designed originally in the sense of those people who did have a quick reaction to danger survived and those who had a slow reaction to danger were eaten. So this is our biological component that this stuff happens really, really fast. But the reaction then that we have to being eaten is real and it happens immediately, except it was all imaginary. It didn't happen in reality. There actually are no pythons on the floor. There is no alligators crawling up the steps onto the porch. Right. That's the whole idea, is that our memories of seeing things will spark our, let us say, reflex actions. This actually, the reflex action we're talking about is an instinctual reaction, and the instinct is the self-preservation instinct. Instinct, all right? And that that instinct is triggered and is intended through evolution to be very fast, because when it's slow, we get eaten. So we need to react very quickly. This is why the frustration will appear before you even know that it's appearing, that it's already there. That's because it comes up that fast. So the question is, as a meditator, are you also fast enough to be there for it when it is actually going through this arising cycle?

**Speaker B:** When we notice the anxiety or whatever as manifesting in the body with a tension here, whatever, would the procedure be

**Speaker A:** to,

**Speaker B:** say, counteract or perhaps like relax that body part, like perhaps with a long deep breath, relaxing breath, something like that, so that the mind starts learning that there's no need to produce what it's producing and rewire, I guess, the brain?

**Speaker A:** Yes, you use the correct word precisely, and that is relax. Or another word to use is to nurture. In other words, you begin to take the part of the mind that was involved with the frustration, which is almost always a critical parent mentality, critical thinking. The critical thinking is, oh, that guy is going to cause trouble again. Oh, that guy wants this, that, and the other thing. Oh, that guy is so hard to deal with. These are the kind of critical thoughts that then put the child part of our feeling area back into the feelings that we had when we were a child. And so we can see that this, in fact, is a two-step punch, that the anxiety and the frustration doesn't arise on its own. Something triggered it. And That normally what happens is that when people do see that stuff, their natural reaction is to hit that same trigger again. What we need to do is intentionally and consciously come back to the point of a worthy investigation. But the worthy investigation is not going to be easily done by something that's resisting the investigation. So the investigation, again, the best way to do the investigation is back to a friendly way, is to come to being friends with the frustration. That's it. Can you become friends with the frustration? Once you have the attitude of being friends with the frustration, now we can do an inspection of the frustration. Where is it? You know, is it here? Is it here in the neck? Watch that tension. If there is tension in the neck, can I roll my head around and play with it? Can I feel that tension? Is it more on one side or the other? Can I put some muscle rub on it and rub the neck and allow the neck to feel nice and comfortable? I mean, if you've been giving yourself tension over this one thing, how many times have you been giving yourself neck tension over already? Right variety of things. So now giving it a massage, putting some muscle rub on, and relaxing and saying everything's going to be all right. This guy does not have me by the throat. I do. And it's nurturing. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So you're saying there needs to be— so there's there's a recognition of the anxiety as an emotion on the mind, then there's the recognition of its manifestation on the body, then there must be a process of friendliness in the sense that to not develop aversion towards that emotion being there, which is not going to be very pleasant. So there needs to be practice to not develop aversion towards and then I guess the process of attenuating or relaxing it through whatever, deep breath or a massage or whatever. Is this somewhat correct?

**Speaker A:** All right, so in a way, the way of talking about it then is relaxing it or making it okay. In other words, we become friends with it. Before it's relaxed.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Hello, darkness, my old friend. Or hello, tension, my old friend. Boy, I'm glad I can see you again, because otherwise you've got me by the throat. But now that I can see you, I can massage. And not only can I massage with my hand, but the whole part of the whole point of massaging one's body with the hand like that to remove the tension is that now you have the mental position of nurturing. That's why you're using the hand like this, is to nurture the body. And so we can— we're taking the attitude change from being a victim of this guy and being frustrated, and now we're a victim of our own frustration. And so we're moving from victimhood to victimhood to victimhood. When we can see that victimhood also— hello, Mr. Victim, my darkness, my old friend— I can see that I deal with things as a victim, which means that I am struggling and pulling on this rope while really I'm being pulled around by it, and I'm struggling to hold on to something that's dragging me around.

**Speaker B:** It's actually interesting because like there's a— it has been recognized that when we, for example, say if we hug ourselves, the mechanisms of hugging, the touching, and the association of the hug creates a similar positive attitude or state as if someone were to be hugging us. In that same gentle way. So I guess when we do the nurturing, like, of the neck, it's, uh, it's, it's doing that.

**Speaker A:** Uh, yes. And by the way, my neck right now feels so much better than it did just 2 minutes ago. That nurturing is still going on. Wow, it feels so good. Okay, so this is the way to begin to approach this, because as you can see that when the frustration starts, now the thoughts are in line with them. So you'll continue to have thoughts about that guy and having more frustration and then more thoughts about him and more frustration. And you think that all the frustration that I have now will go away if I could only figure out what to do or how to deal with that guy. So let me dwell on how to figure out that guy so that the frustrations will go away.

**Speaker C:** Well, generally what happens for me is I tend to think, if I just practice correctly, if I just— I'm not practicing correctly, I must be doing something wrong. I'm noticing, but then I'm not knowing what to do from there. And then it sort of gets into this berating pattern of like berating me for being a bad Buddhist practitioner.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. And yet you've heard it said before That's that famous story. It's in the half sutta that the Buddha had with Ananda, where Ananda comes from Sariputta and says— Sariputta says friendship is half the Dhamma. And the Buddha— no, friendship is the whole thing. Normally what we mean by friendship is friendship with the outside world. But it's very hard to be friends with the outside world if we're not friends with the inside world, that in fact, if we're not friendly with ourselves on the inside, what that means is that we are artificially creating boundaries or separations in the mind so that we wind up being a crowd. We'll have this thought and that's against that thought, and this thought is against that thought all over the place. And what we mean by this friendliness is let's begin to make friends with the darker parts. Let's start nourishing even the critical part. Let's start unifying the mind and making ourselves friends within the parts so that we unify the mind through friendship. And by doing so, then we can deal with the outside world with that same friendship for unity's sake. So this whole idea of duality versus unity, you've heard that old argument, it's a spiritual argument that's going on for centuries. And people think about it's them against the world, and that's the duality. No, the real duality is the crowd inside. That's the duality is the number one, the frustration, and number two, the one who dislikes the frustration. That's two of the crowd in there. We need to bring a third one in, in the sense of making the change or tweaking it so that when frustration arises, that too can be nurtured and integrated and recognizing it. Yes, I do have a feeling of tension in my neck or feeling of emptiness in the belly, but those feelings are not going to interfere with my relationship with that guy. But in fact, I'm going to deal with those feelings and integrate them in now so I can begin to feel that neck and feel that tension and do the relaxation. Go to the gut, rub your belly, massage, let yourself know that empty deepness, emptiness in there is just a sensation caused by chemicals that are controlled by the mind. And delivered often with either the lymphatic system or the lymphs work through the blood system. But this is the way that it all happens, is that these chemicals are turned on and off, and critical chemicals are different than nurturing chemicals. And so coming back to Hello Darkness, My Old Friend, coming back to nurturing, coming back to, yeah, there's tension, there's anxiety. Never mind. So what? I can deal with tension and anxiety easily. I've dealt with it for years and survived. Now I can deal with it happily. And so this is the mental change of attitude. And as you've noticed in this talk, we've talked much more about the feelings, the feelings of stress, the feelings of tension, the feelings of struggle, the feelings of frustration. But we can also look at it from the perspective of these feelings are created by our thoughts. And you can see that, that in fact, you can start thinking about this guy. And as you do, you work your feelings up. It's almost like a hand pump. And the more thoughts you have on that, then the more pumped up with anxiety and tension and frustration you get until it becomes so big that you can't— it's almost like When you're starting to blow up a balloon, whether it's done by the mouth or the machine or whatever, the first important thing is, is that our intention is filled, is played with filling the balloon, pumping, getting the thing right. But that changes very quickly into we no longer pay attention to the filling of the balloon. Now we're paying attention to the balloon being filled. Different perspective. Okay, so that happens in the mind, that in the beginning we're pumping, we're beginning to fill the mind with all those thoughts about, oh, it's going to be a tragedy, I've got so much work to do, that guy's going to be pissed off, you know, all of those kind of thoughts that come with the pumping. And now we're taking the mindset and putting it on, look what we have just pumped up.

**Speaker B:** Is that— is the order always the— that is the order? Because it seems that— so I first realized that a thought leads to an emotion, and then an emotion leads to a bodily sensation. But now I'm starting to notice that the other, the opposite direction also happens, that there's a bodily sensation that then gets— leads to an emotion, and then that leads to a thought. But I'm wondering if that's just like, if I don't know, if there's like, if there was a thought prior to the original bodily sensation that I just didn't notice. And the order is always the same, what if it goes like this and like this? So it seems to go both ways, or there's a possibility to go both ways.

**Speaker A:** Right. And in fact, we're talking about step 7 now of Anapanasati. Is to begin to see this connection is a two-way road, a two-way street, that anger and frustration will create a way of thinking, and a way of thinking will create anger and frustration. We can see many examples of that. One example of it is, is that when people are angry and frustrated, They can't think straight.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so in debates, one of the things to do is to get your opponent on defense. And so attacking not his point of view or his debate topic, we attack him instead and bring his ego into it. And that will then get his mind on to him rather than on topic. All right. And so that's why there's a rule, no ad hominem attacks in debates, which means now we have to find other ways to get his ego involved because we can't attack him directly. One of them is winking and flirting with him because that will get his ego involved also. So this is the point that we're making is, is the there are conditioners. If you feel sick, your body is sick, that will condition how you feel and what you think about. Yeah. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about it in the sense that when the body is sick, that's an excellent opportunity to practice. That's like going to the gym and going to the back alley there where the big weights are. And let's do some big weight pumping right now. Why? Because we're sick. I mean, here we are with these weights. Let's exercise this. Get the mind back, pumped back up again. In other words, if the body can make that sick, can make the mind sick, then we can then make the mind well, which will then help the body get well. Yeah, if we even know that, we need to know that exactly, that in fact, the doctors are still flabbergasted with spontaneous remission of cancer.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think it has been recognized that, like, people who are in good mental states heal much faster than those who are in constant negative mental states and that sort of stuff. So that there is that connection there that yes, we do.

**Speaker A:** We're beginning to see that at a scientific physiological level that the Buddha wrote down in or didn't write down, but he talked about it in his description of Anapanasati, that the feelings of Vedana conditions the Citta and the Citta conditions the Vedana, the Vedana conditions the body or the Kaya. And in it is a circle around there of conditioning. And so if we have a thought that drags us down into bad feelings and we dwell in those bad feelings, the body will begin to get lethargic also. In other words, we have defeating thoughts, then the defeating thoughts will give us defeating feelings, and that will defeat the body also, that we literally can make ourselves sick. Yeah. And we can also heal ourselves if we are able to change our attitude about it. And this is the whole idea then of nurturing the body when it's sick rather than criticizing the body when it's sick. If we criticize the body when it's sick, it's going to get sicker. If you criticize your emotions, then your emotions are going to get sicker. If we nurture our broken emotions, they will heal. If we nurture our broken body, it will heal. That's the whole idea of— and it's called the power of positive thinking. But this is not positive thinking. This is nurturing thinking. An example of positive thinking of, oh, you're not sick. You're okay. Get up and go to school. Okay? That's positive thinking. That's not what we're talking about. The nurturing is, oh, you poor dear, you're so sick. Haha. And so dealing with reality, we're not trying to cheer the mind up by telling ourselves lies. We're here cheering ourselves up with the reality. That cheering ourselves up is beneficial.

**Speaker C:** I think this kind of reminds me of when Johnny was talking about— sorry, I'm probably saying your name wrong.

**Speaker B:** No, that's correct. That's good.

**Speaker C:** Okay, okay. But when you were saying that on retreat, on day 3, that you just became okay with the pain, that it sort of reminds me of that attitude shift because you weren't you weren't like shifting it in a positive mindset and saying, oh no, we'll just get through this. But it sounded like from what you were saying that it was more like, well, the pain's just there. And that's just my reality right now. But I'm okay with it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I just stopped resisting it. I think that's the best way to put it. I just stopped wanting it to not be there. And then it was there and it was fine.

**Speaker A:** Right. So that's the change of attitude. We no longer resisting, we're no longer standing in in the way of that punch, but we're stepping aside and let it miss us.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. We're not resisting it anymore. That we're— instead of using the word letting go, perhaps even a more striking way of speaking about it is to stand aside. Let it miss you. The example that I sometimes use is imagine that you're standing on the highway and a big truck is barreling down. He's even blaring his horn. Okay. And the meditator looks up and sees the truck coming. There are three possible outcomes. One is that we stand there and let it run over us, which is normally what we do. And this is called choiceless awareness. Oh, I'm frustrated. Oh, I'm so frustrated. Frustrated, you know. And then there's the Popeye. He's going to eat his can of spinach and he's going to stand there and he's going to stop that lorry from hitting him. He gets run over too. But this one's the one who struggles against it. Oh, you should not be frustrated. Oh, you got to stop that, you know. That's that mentality. But that one's a little bit smarter than just getting run over with it. That in fact, many people dedicate themselves to meditation, working too hard, struggling with it, but they're going to make a bit more progress than the ones who just keep getting run over by their own mind. There's a third way, and that's to stand aside. Just get out of the road. Just say, you can't touch me. Just get out of the way. This is the way of thinking about it. That's the easy way. Okay, now what that means is stepping out of the road means stepping out of the conflict in whatever regard we think of that conflict, to stand aside, which means now we're beginning to nurture. We in fact can cheer that lawyer. Yeah, go, boy, go! Yeah, you've gone! You've gone! And so that's that. In fact, that point is the point that is important within the context of, let us say, the adept practitioner rather than the wrong student. And that is, is that we begin now to pay more closely attention to the things that are falling away, rotting away, going away, that in fact we begin to appreciate frustration by only seeing its backside as it disappears, as it leaves the scene. That's the way to start dealing with it, is that instead of dealing with the arising, because that's the way that we normally did when we were children, we see things coming. Now we're going to watch things passing away. We see the arising. Now we're going to see stuff pass away. We could say, oh, that tension in the neck is just passing away. Yeah, there it goes. Okay, so this is another way of talking about it. Go ahead, go ahead, Johnny.

**Speaker B:** I'm really sorry to interrupt. It's just that I have something to do in about 2 minutes, so I have to go. But it was really nice talking with both of you.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's nice meeting you.

**Speaker B:** You too, man. And yeah, Merry Christmas. I don't know if Dhammarato celebrates that

**Speaker A:** or not, but Oh, thank you for mentioning that. Yes, Christmas is a holiday, right? Every day you say you're on holidays.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, all the time.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I'm on— yeah, I'm on holiday, right? So Christmas is just another holiday.

**Speaker B:** Does that mean that you're here tomorrow? Because I might— I might, since I have like a couple days of, uh, free time myself. So maybe I'll call tomorrow as well. Maybe, uh, if you're around.

**Speaker A:** Johnny? Yes.

**Speaker B:** Right, cool. Sounds good.

**Speaker A:** All right, gotta go. See you. Okay, bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** So,

**Speaker A:** uh, Joe, we can, we can go ahead and finish up. I think that we've kind of gotten the, uh, uh, the point that, uh, so we'll just do a short review, and that is, is that we are a crowd inside, and that crowd is, uh created by criticism. And that the idea then is to become reunified. And the way that we do that is with the intention and the attitude of becoming whole again, which means accepting the various parts that are within us with the idea of letting that stuff relax or to see it in hindsight as it passes away. This is the whole way of looking at it, because in fact, when we see it coming, that's the danger point. And if we merely step out of the way, then the danger will pass on by. And then we can say things like, miss me, can't touch me. That's the kind of the attitude that we have. Frustration, nothing to it. Just unhook and off we go. And we keep developing those thoughts. So when— because the frustration is not going to go away that quickly, but by playing with it, by taking a few short breaths, by recognizing the tension in the neck and massaging, taking deep breaths, this kind of stuff, and making these feelings, these Frustrations are toys to play with rather than running away. Yeah, right, because when you're avoiding it, you're creating it. Yeah, hang on a second. Piti, Prajna, Anicca. So, uh, have somebody in the yard. Okay, so I got to take care of that. But, uh, anyway, um, let's go ahead and finish up with this, with the, with the idea that you can do this. You in fact can change your attitude about it. Yeah, that you can have friendly thoughts about your frustrations, and you can have friendly thoughts about the guy.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I got like an hour, an hour left to— before I have to meet him. So you can use that out to practice, uh, chill out.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly. Just chill, knowing that everything is going to be all right. Okay, thank you so much. We'll see you. Yeah, Joe, we'll see you later. Bye-bye.

**Speaker C:** See you.

**Speaker A:** Good luck.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends Johnny (Speaker B) and Joe (Speaker C), revolves around integrating meditation insights into daily life, with a focus on transforming difficult mental states like frustration and anxiety.

Here is a summary of the key themes and advice:

**Core Teaching: From Resistance to Friendly Investigation**
The central instruction is to stop struggling against or resisting unpleasant experiences (pain, frustration, anxiety). Instead, one should adopt an attitude of **friendly investigation**—treating these inner states as "old friends" to be understood, not enemies to be defeated.

**Key Points from the Discussion:**

1.  **Johnny's Retreat Experience:** Johnny shares that on a Goenka retreat, he experienced significant physical pain. By the third day, an "attitude shift" occurred: he stopped resisting the pain. The sensation remained, but the **suffering** (the mental resistance) ceased, illustrating the difference between pain and suffering.

2.  **Understanding Mental Phenomena:** Dhammarato normalizes Johnny's "visual hallucinations" (geometric shapes) as a natural, fleeting function of the mind. He explains that the mind stores and recalls information primarily in visual and sensory formats, which form the basis of our thoughts and memories.

3.  **Joe's Practical Dilemma:** Joe brings the discussion to a real-world challenge: intense frustration and anxiety about an upcoming meeting with a difficult official. His habitual pattern is to obsessively worry, which only creates more internal struggle and a feeling of being "run over."

4.  **The "Catch-22" of Frustration:** Dhammarato identifies the core problem: resisting frustration only creates more frustration. He uses analogies:
    *   **The Hook:** Struggling against a hook only embeds it deeper. The solution is to give it slack.
    *   **Jiu-Jitsu / "The Give":** The martial art principle of using an opponent's force against them by yielding. Similarly, yield to the frustration to understand it.
    *   **The Truck:** You can let it run you over (passive suffering), stand and fight it (struggle), or simply **step out of the road** (stop identifying with it).

5.  **Practical Method: Nurturing the Mind-Body Connection**
    *   **Locate the Sensation:** When frustration or anxiety arises, find where it manifests in the body (e.g., tension in the neck, tightness in the gut).
    *   **Change the Attitude:** Instead of aversion, greet it with friendliness: *"Hello tension, my old friend."*
    *   **Nurture and Relax:** Physically nurture that area (e.g., gentle massage, deep breathing) while mentally sending it kindness and acceptance. This act of self-nurturing chemically and mentally counteracts the stress response.
    *   **Watch it Pass:** Shift focus from the *arising* of the feeling to observing its *passing away*. This builds the insight of impermanence (*anicca*).

6.  **Unifying the Inner Crowd:** The mind becomes a conflicted "crowd" when one part criticizes another (e.g., "I shouldn't feel this way!"). The path is to **unify the mind through internal friendship**, making peace with all parts of oneself.

7.  **Preparation for Challenges:** The best preparation for any difficult meeting or event is not anxious cramming or rehearsal, but cultivating the **singular intention to be friendly and enjoy the connection**. This puts the mind in a cooperative, open state rather than a defensive one.

**Conclusion:** The talk emphasizes that Dhamma practice is about changing our **relationship** to experience. By replacing resistance and criticism with friendly investigation and self-nurturing, we can unhook from suffering, unify our minds, and meet the external world with genuine warmth and less friction.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Speaker A, likely Dhammarato) uses a rich tapestry of **metaphors and stories** to explain meditation, the mind, and dealing with difficult emotions like frustration and anxiety. Here is a breakdown:

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies**

**1. The Computer/Hard Drive**
*   **Metaphor:** The mind is like a computer's hard drive.
*   **Usage:** Explains how we store and recall experiences. We only store input (sights, sounds, feelings) and cannot create entirely new data from nothing. This storage shapes how we think—primarily visually for humans.

**2. The Hook & Slack / Tug-of-War / Jiu-Jitsu**
*   **Metaphor:** Frustration or internal conflict is like being hooked or playing tug-of-war.
*   **Story/Usage:** Struggling against frustration (pulling the rope) only creates more tension. The solution is to "give slack"—to stop resisting. This is compared to the martial art principle of *Jiu-Jitsu* or *Goju-ryu* (where "ju" means "to give"), where you use an opponent's force against them by yielding and redirecting.

**3. The Truck on the Highway**
*   **Metaphor:** A difficult emotion (frustration, pain) is like a truck barreling down a highway.
*   **Usage:** Presents three responses:
    *   **Choiceless Awareness (Getting Run Over):** Just being a passive victim to the emotion.
    *   **The Popeye/Struggler (Stopping the Truck):** Fighting the emotion head-on, which still leads to being overwhelmed.
    *   **The Wise Meditator (Stepping Aside):** The correct approach—simply getting out of the road, letting the emotion pass by without engaging in conflict. "You can't touch me."

**4. "Hello Darkness, My Old Friend"**
*   **Metaphor/Story:** Uses the lyric from Simon & Garfunkel's *The Sound of Silence*.
*   **Usage:** Re-frames "darkness" (frustration, anxiety, negative patterns) not as an enemy to avoid, but as an "old friend"—a familiar part of oneself that needs to be acknowledged, investigated, and integrated with friendliness rather than aversion.

**5. The Lion's Mane**
*   **Metaphor:** Tension in the human neck is like a lion's mane.
*   **Usage:** Explains why we hold tension in our necks: as a protective instinct (the lion's mane protects its vulnerable neck during attack). Our neck tension is a physical manifestation of a mental feeling of being under threat or needing protection.

**6. Inflating a Balloon**
*   **Metaphor:** Building anxiety is like inflating a balloon.
*   **Usage:** Initially, we actively "pump" (generate anxious thoughts). Soon, our attention shifts from the pumping action to the *balloon itself*—the large, looming feeling of anxiety that now seems like an independent object we must deal with.

**7. The Child and the Wolf**
*   **Metaphor:** A child seeing a wolf for the first time.
*   **Usage:** Illustrates that fear is not inherent in objects, but comes from stored mental associations (the *samskara*). The child with no prior concept of a wolf feels no fear until a story/association is created.

### **Supporting Stories & References**

*   **Star Wars Hyperdrive:** Used to describe Speaker B's precise geometric visual hallucinations ("stars begin to elongate" converging on a point).
*   **The Buddha and Ananda on Friendship:** References the sutta where the Buddha says that spiritual friendship is not half, but the *whole* of the spiritual life. The talk extends this to mean friendship *with oneself* and one's inner "darkness."
*   **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's Sick Body:** References the teaching that a sick body is like a gym for the mind—a powerful opportunity to practice because the mind must work to not be brought down by physical condition.
*   **Studying/Cramming in School:** Used as a story for how we develop poor mental habits (cramming with anxiety) that we then misapply to adult situations like job interviews.

### **Overall Theme of the Metaphors**
The metaphors collectively build a framework for understanding the mind and meditation practice:
*   **The Problem:** The mind is a storage device that creates habitual, often fearful, stories. We get hooked by these stories and emotions, leading to internal conflict (a crowd inside).
*   **The Solution:** Change your relationship through **attitude shift**. Don't fight or flee. Instead, "step aside," "give slack," "make friends," and "nurture." Observe sensations and emotions as they **pass away**, not as they arise. This unified, friendly, non-resistant attitude is the path to healing and peace.

The talk masterfully uses everyday, pop culture, and natural-world analogies to make abstract Dhamma concepts like *anicca* (impermanence), *dukkha* (suffering), *samskara* (mental formations), and *sati* (mindfulness) deeply practical and relatable.
