### Transcript


**Speaker A:** And if you do experience it, you experience how common it is. It's actually omnipresent. It's always with you. It's always been with you. It's how you experience anything at all. And so it's also— How can anything

**Speaker B:** be always with you when you is dependently arising?

**Speaker A:** Only a false self of sense is dependently arising.

**Speaker C:** I think he's talking about like something—

**Speaker A:** What do you mean by that?

**Speaker B:** I don't think that's true.

**Speaker C:** That isn't dependently arising.

**Speaker B:** Whatever self that there is. What self is not dependent arising?

**Speaker A:** So I mean, like, if we're talking about ultimate absolute theory here about things that like would make sense even beyond the universe, I mean, what you're trying to do is like really go beyond the relative. And what we're talking about is our progress right now as human beings, for me and you, you know, like us three or us four. I don't think any of us has gone beyond omnipresent to the sense that we could sense like something beyond omnipresence, you know. So before we kind of negate the goal as not being worth it, we should actually like try to get to the goal first, you know.

**Speaker B:** And so I don't have any goals. I don't have any goals at all. I don't think that having goals is a good idea. I think that's Dukkha. I think that's suffering. I think that's not what the Buddha taught.

**Speaker A:** Right. So I mean, what I was getting at though is if we say everything is independently arising, we could say that to a certain extent. We could say that to the extent

**Speaker B:** that the universe— Independently arising, dependently arising, meaning that it depends on another thing.

**Speaker A:** But we only know what is dependently arising according to our experience of reality. We cannot see beyond the veil of the universe. We can't see beyond the Big Bang. We can't see other things that are out there.

**Speaker B:** So why are we— So before— Okay,

**Speaker A:** I think what we're saying is that there is a sense of relative omnipresence for us, you know, and if that omnipresence doesn't extend beyond the edges of the universe, I don't think we should negate it and saying that like logically,

**Speaker B:** you know, what universe, the universe that is the universe that is in Robert's world right there is that poster behind him, the phone that he's looking at, that other poster right there. You know, the mic in front of him. That's the universe.

**Speaker C:** So can I try to— Corey, can I try to explain your point as like I understand it to try and help Kishon understand it? Sure. So I think a way we could like try to understand this is like existence and non-existence. And this is like something my friend sent to me earlier today. But it's like we can say that something exists but that's not dependently arising on non-existence because there's no experience of non-existence because that would be like nothing, right? So if anything's independently arising, it's that something exists, and then all the dependently arising things are included within this, you know, super category, this meta category of just like existence itself. And then like, I think this is all based on philosophy, by the way. I have zero experience of this like spiritually. And then I think what Corey is

**Speaker B:** saying— yeah, that means it's not really

**Speaker C:** like— it's like the, it's like the ultimate experience.

**Speaker B:** It's like, I think, I think— yeah, yeah, can you start again from from— you said that anything that is not existing is dependent. Wait, what?

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** So we can, we can say rationally, sanely, logically that something exists because it's directly obvious that there's something here, that there is a present moment, that it exists. But the existence of the present moment doesn't dependently arise on a non-present moment. Because that's still within like the Metta category of the present moment. So it's like we can't escape like this work. This is way too— it's philosophy. Like, I, I, I haven't like tied this in some big muscles, man.

**Speaker A:** It's like the brain muscle. I'm just trying to— we are talking about— if we're talking about the three

**Speaker C:** marks of existence, is that what you're talking about, Corey? Like the ultimate super category of the present moment is always like present, and it's like eternal. It might not even be worth it.

**Speaker A:** Okay, it's not the end goal, ultimate everything, because there's other things that are ultimate and end goal. Mind is one of them, you know. Mind is also seemingly omnipresent.

**Speaker B:** How much philosophy is enough, Corey? How much philosophy is enough, Robert?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I mean, just exploration about it

**Speaker B:** and relax and just take a deep breath.

**Speaker A:** And philosophy should inspire people to find out for themselves. Yeah, no, I mean, when I say these things, they began as philosophy. Someone else experienced it and then they were able to share it. And then I was curious enough to try it. I had enough faith in myself to try it. And I actually was able to experience some modicum of these things they're talking about. So it, yeah, I don't think it is like not worth, you know, investigating or trying just because it seems so outlandish, you know. It should be, If you have at least some degree of curiosity— It's not

**Speaker B:** that it seems outlandish, it just seems like not necessary, not the path. It just seems like not important at all, and that it's like not really going anywhere. It seems like it's going to Moore's philosophy, which is typically what happens.

**Speaker A:** It doesn't have to go anywhere. It's omnipresent. Only the concept of us, only our ingrained desires of a need to do something, a need to be something, a need to go somewhere. That is what is not seeing the value of omnipresence.

**Speaker C:** I have a question for Corey. It might sound silly on the surface, but this is a serious question. If I took like 100% on faith right now that I was fully enlightened, would I be fully enlightened? And I like completely believe it, or would I just be delusional, or would I actually be like an Arahant? Like if I completely believed it, like I truly like 100%, no doubt.

**Speaker B:** You're delusional in all scenarios because What's the definition of enlightenment that you're using? And actually, if you take anything, if you're like 100% off the description, that's pretty intense.

**Speaker A:** That's pretty intense.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's not very— yeah.

**Speaker C:** So yes, it's not likely to happen. I'd have to, I'd have to be maybe like in some sort of like bipolar episode or something to really like be able to like believe something so strongly. But like, Cory, do you think like if you truly believe that, would it be like my real reality?

**Speaker A:** But look, that's a hard one.

**Speaker C:** Like taking faith to its ultimate conclusion.

**Speaker A:** Well, maybe we could say something along the lines of like, if you take faith to its ultimate conclusion, it might end in some kind of limited experience where you're able to kind of tap into it. But I don't think that faith is

**Speaker B:** able to— You mentioned the spiral of death and Seattle Street Dhammas. I'm going to leave the rest of you guys to carry it.

**Speaker A:** Hey, dude, I'm just going to stop you right there.

**Speaker B:** I've actually never been to Seattle streets. No, I'll leave you guys.

**Speaker A:** Tie in concepts about my teaching to me, dude. What if I started talking about what Chicago's like and I tied it to you?

**Speaker B:** It's not yours.

**Speaker A:** Would that be cool?

**Speaker B:** That would be amazing.

**Speaker A:** I've never gone into Pragmatic Dharma. I've never gone to like the local— I've never drank the local Kool-Aid. I mean, honestly, I'm only saying it because you've done it like 3 or 4 times. And so for you, it seems to

**Speaker B:** be important to do that. No, I'm just saying you guys enjoy discussing the strict— Yeah, I'm not shutting down the party. I think the recording like went into a second piece. Because it's like, say, 6 minutes now instead of 3 hours.

**Speaker C:** Maybe, maybe. Yeah, could be.

**Speaker A:** Sure, man. I mean, I'm the call.

**Speaker C:** Will the recording stop?

**Speaker B:** What was that?

**Speaker C:** If you leave the call, will the recording stop?

**Speaker B:** I can just, I can just end it now. Uh, goodbye everyone.

**Speaker C:** Bye.

**Speaker B:** See you.

**Speaker C:** Have a great


### Summary

This is a summary of the Dhamma talk between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and Sangha friends (Speakers B & C):

**Core Topic:** The conversation revolves around the nature of existence, self, and enlightenment, specifically debating whether there is an "omnipresent" reality or ground of being that is *not* dependently arisen.

**Key Arguments:**

*   **Speaker A (Dhammarato):** Argues for a direct, experiential understanding. He suggests there is an omnipresent aspect to reality ("how you experience anything at all") that is always with us. He distinguishes this from the "false self," which *is* dependently arisen. His point is practical: before dismissing this goal as philosophically incoherent, one should first try to experientially reach it through practice.
*   **Speaker B:** Takes a strict, doctrine-focused stance. He challenges the idea of anything not being dependently arisen (*paticcasamuppāda*), a core Buddhist teaching. He sees the discussion as pointless philosophy that leads away from the path, and asserts that having goals itself is a form of *dukkha* (suffering).
*   **Speaker C:** Tries to mediate and explain Speaker A's point philosophically. He uses the analogy of "existence" itself as a meta-category that doesn't dependently arise on "non-existence," as non-existence is not an experience. He admits this is intellectual and not based on spiritual experience.

**Turning Points & Tension:**

1.  **The Practical vs. Doctrinal Divide:** The central clash is between Speaker A's appeal to direct experience and potential realities beyond current understanding, and Speaker B's insistence on adhering strictly to the doctrinal teaching of dependent origination as the ultimate truth.
2.  **The Question of Goals:** Speaker B's statement that having goals is suffering creates a fundamental disagreement about the motivation for practice.
3.  **The "Faith" Experiment:** Speaker C asks a provocative question: If he took 100% faith that he was enlightened, would he be enlightened or delusional? This highlights the tension between belief, experience, and genuine realization.
4.  **Breakdown:** The discussion becomes heated when Speaker B references "Seattle Street Dharma" (likely a critique of a specific pragmatic or non-traditional approach), which Speaker A takes personally as a mischaracterization of his teaching. This leads to Speaker B leaving the call abruptly.

**Conclusion:** The talk ends unresolved and with tension. It showcases a common debate in modern Buddhist circles: the conflict between traditional doctrine and teachings that point to direct, non-conceptual experience, and the challenges of discussing such topics without devolving into philosophical debate or personal friction.

**In essence:** The discussion was a debate on whether enlightenment points to realizing a dependently-arisen, empty process (Speaker B's view) or an ever-present, non-dual ground of awareness (Speaker A's suggestion), and whether intellectual philosophy aids or hinders that pursuit.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this transcript, the primary metaphors and stories are:

**1. The Metaphor of the "Veil" or "Edge" of the Universe**
*   **Used by:** Speaker A
*   **Purpose:** To argue that human experience and knowledge are limited. We cannot see "beyond the veil of the universe" or "beyond the Big Bang." This metaphor supports the idea that we should focus on the "relative omnipresence" we *can* experience rather than getting lost in absolute, unknowable truths.

**2. The Metaphor of the "Goal" and the "Path"**
*   **Used by:** Speaker A and Speaker B (in opposition)
*   **Purpose:**
    *   **Speaker A** uses the "goal" (e.g., experiencing omnipresence) as a metaphor for a spiritual achievement worth striving for. He argues "before we... negate the goal as not being worth it, we should actually... try to get to the goal first."
    *   **Speaker B** counters this by rejecting the metaphor of "goals" entirely, equating it with *dukkha* (suffering) and asserting "that's not what the Buddha taught." For Speaker B, the path is goal-less.

**3. The Metaphor of "Existence" as a "Super Category" or "Meta Category"**
*   **Used by:** Speaker C (attempting to explain Speaker A's point)
*   **Purpose:** To philosophically separate a fundamental, non-dependent "existence" from the dependently arising things within it. The metaphor suggests that the simple fact *that* something exists is primary and not itself dependent on "non-existence." This is framed as a logical, philosophical container for all experience.

**4. The Metaphor of "Drinking the Local Kool-Aid"**
*   **Used by:** Speaker A
*   **Purpose:** This is a cultural story/metaphor implying uncritical acceptance of a specific group's ideology. Speaker A uses it to accuse Speaker B of unfairly associating his (A's) ideas with the "Pragmatic Dharma" or "Seattle Streets" community, which he claims he has not been part of. It's a defensive metaphor about intellectual independence.

**5. The Story/Allusion to "The Spiral of Death and Seattle Street Dhammas"**
*   **Used by:** Speaker B
*   **Purpose:** This appears to be a reference to a specific critique or meme within certain online Dharma communities (likely referring to unproductive, circular debates). Speaker B uses it as a shorthand story to dismiss the direction of the conversation, implying it's leading into a known dead-end of philosophical abstraction.

**6. The Implied Story of "Faith Leading to Experience"**
*   **Used by:** Speaker A
*   **Purpose:** While not a full story, Speaker A outlines a narrative arc: "Someone else experienced it... they were able to share it... I had enough faith... to try it. And I actually was able to experience... these things." This is a story of spiritual transmission where philosophy points to a potential experience, which faith and personal investigation can then reveal.

**Summary:** The dialogue is rich with conceptual metaphors (**Veil, Goal, Super-Category**) and community-specific stories/allusions (**Kool-Aid, Spiral of Death**). These devices are used to debate core issues: the limits of knowledge, the validity of spiritual goals, the nature of existence, and the pitfalls of abstract philosophy versus direct experience.
