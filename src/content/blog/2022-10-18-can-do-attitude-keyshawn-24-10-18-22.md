### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Been doing this. Like, this is kind of what I had left, like where I left off at in a way. Um, you know, maybe like after meeting her, or I could say maybe after Eric left, at that point in time when things just have not been as, uh, not pounding the pavement quite as heavily with it. But still doing it. But just this last week has been kind of a blast back to that past, and very— the practices has— I mean, you know, just all the things we're talking about here about catching it and that attitude and feeling, you know, whatever, like that.

**Speaker B:** Funny like that, you know, that in fact what you're mentioning is, is that, uh, Adam blames Eve, the man blames the woman, and the woman says, oh well, it's not my fault, it's your damn talking snake. Yeah, that's the problem.

**Speaker A:** Your videos— pardon? Your video is off. I can't see you.

**Speaker B:** Now. You don't see me now. You do.

**Speaker A:** There you go, now we got it.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so, um, anyway, yes, that's what happens when we go, um, out of a noble relationship into, uh, uh, an ordinary relationship. And when she's in that ordinary state, she pulls you into it because you're not strong enough yet to stay out of it. And in fact, that's actually an excellent opportunity. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa would call that opportunity, just like sickness, it's an opportunity to practice. Can you as a noble remain noble-minded even when you're around someone who will do anything to pull you out of being noble.

**Speaker A:** That's a very good point, and I know all about being sick when I'm with someone noble. That could be the next paper that I write, because that's actually, I think, an even greater story than the one in the woods when Eric and I were sick. I mean, and we remember we talked about that quite a bit.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, I also remember the bear. That wasn't there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker B:** And the stump, or the fallen log that you were able to use as a meditation object. Yeah, I remember a lot about that. So, uh, this situation though, now you can recognize that value of being able to shut your mouth. To not get involved with it, because that's the next step into don't care. Let her do what she wants to do. But the thing of it is, is that whether she knows it or not, when you remain noble, it's hard for her to stay hardcore ignoble. That if you come and bring a, let us say, truckload full of snow and dump it into your living room, it's really hard to stay hot.

**Speaker A:** Well, we last time we talked, we were talking about how, oh, you learn how to shut your mouth. Now it's time to only let wholesome things come out.

**Speaker B:** Uh-huh, exactly. That's the thing to do then, is that first we need to shut up because we're the dragon mouth too.

**Speaker A:** Same, bro.

**Speaker B:** Yes. So we have to shut our yap so that we could cool off inside. And then you deliver only wholesome thoughts. By the way, how did that operate? How did that work for you when you were mindfully only saying wholesome things to her?

**Speaker A:** That was really good. That was really good. Yeah. It's just like the mind. It's just like when I'm only saying wholesome things to myself, it's really good. It's funny because, uh, yeah, I guess you talked— we talked about this a lot with, um, when you fall down, right? Or something unwholesome comes out, or the mind— like, for example, I was just on a walk and having wholesome thoughts, and then an unwholesome thought, and I noticed I was watching myself on my own facial expression change. Everything kind of just changed. And then boom, I immediately woke because it changed into like, oh, like sadness or like a confused face. But then I caught myself and immediately was like, wow, like, you know, it just perks right up. It's just such a night and day experience. So when you are saying things with your mouth that are not wholesome, but if you go back to being wholesome, it's like a totally different experience.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. And, and you're, you're creating that new reality because that's where your mind is. That's that important teaching, that if you're afraid of something, you want to draw those things to you, or whatever you've got on your mind. So if you've got wholesome thoughts now on your mind, when she comes unwholesome, you do not have to go back into the old style. You in fact can remain wholesome. And in the process of learning to do that is when we shut our face, don't let it out. We don't just, like with the Sotagami, yells one time and then shuts his face. That the Anagami is the one who just doesn't let it out. He's wise enough that no matter how bad he feels, just a little bit or a whole lot, it doesn't show. He doesn't tell it. We control the mind enough to shut up just long enough to make a change. So we're actually, in a way, doing Anapanasati right then and there. Wake up. Yeah, look at what we're doing and just shut that mouth. And then to make a change on the inside, bring the mind back into that noble state, that state of joy. And now when we open our mouth, we have something worth hearing.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yeah, it's funny that way, huh? Anapanasati.

**Speaker B:** I was thinking about while we were talking about this is maybe a sitcom or even just a short YouTube video with a guy and his girlfriend, and he in fact is having conversations with an old fat dude in Thailand, and watch the fact that he can actually control her bad feelings. I mean, anybody can do this if they remember that they can, and they know they can. That whole knowledge, I know that you can do this, but the better part is, is that you know that you can in fact respond to unwholesome talk with wholesome. Most people don't know that. They've never seen it before. So I'm thinking about having a sitcom. You know what a sitcom is? Situation comedy. The old television series, you know, like Gunsmoke.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, we're like, the girl is complaining or something and the guy is just positive.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's awesome, right? And then she drags him into it and he recognizes it, goes, talks to his teacher. The teacher talks him out of it and he comes back out of it and deals with his girlfriend and gets her out of it too.

**Speaker A:** Oh, it's a show about me? Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, right. I mean, that's what the inspiration was, is a kind of a sitcom or whatever like that that was actually wholesome. Do something wholesome on television or on YouTube or whatever.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that would be great. I would like to do that. Um, and that's actually something that I had done before too, uh, from time to time, was when she's, uh, complaining about something, maybe about something at work or in her life, not necessarily direct conflict with me, but, you know, just kind of not really saying anything. Maybe like give her a massage or, you know, you don't really need to get into the details of it. Just, you know, what the medium is the message. Okay.

**Speaker B:** I don't know whether it's time to tell you this or not, but I'll go ahead and give you a shot. There's a— there is yet an additional skill that you can develop. Let me ask you a question before we started. Are you ticklish? Where are you most ticklish? Are you ticklish?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, on the bottom of your— I'm pretty ticklish. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so do you know that that's all mental anyway? Yeah, and that, uh, to be honest with you, I've had partners from time to time, uh, at various stages of relationships. But that the point is, is that if you tickle her feet, she will react to that with great joy and laughter. And it's a nice game. You can tickle her and she'll jerk that foot back. Okay, but wait, soon enough she will tickle you the same way. The question is, is that now that you know that it's coming, wakey wakey, when she tickles you, you don't respond. You're able to hold that foot there. It does not have that knee-jerk reaction. Okay, okay. Now we still play that game here at the house, and the way that I do it, uh, and I mean, this is one of the family joyful practices. So Tam will come and tickle my left foot, and my right foot will jerk. And then she'll tickle my right foot, and the left foot will jerk. And then she'll go and tickle both of them, and the hand goes up.

**Speaker A:** Are you doing that to just confuse her?

**Speaker B:** No, she's not confused. Maybe 10 years ago she was confused, but it wasn't even this far along. No, this is a game that we play, but it's actually a game of mental control because she can't keep her feet still. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But you're showing her that you're able to control what you jerk.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that's the whole point. Can you control those bodily reflexes? In other words, can you take control over your body? It's great play, it's great hilarity, and it's also enormously confidence-building when you say, no matter what, I'm not going to move that foot. I'll move the other one or something. And then she tickles you, and then you don't move it. And then you say, aha, I knew I could do it. And then you can do it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And there are many, many things that are like that. You can say, oh, I've got to wake up at 5 in the morning, and you put that in. Guess what? You'll wake up in time. Because you program the mind and you know that you can program the mind. So it's actually a programming. It's like burning in a ROM rather than just a DRAM.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I've done that before. Definitely. Typically when I do that, a lot of time if it's a trip or something, I'll wake up even earlier.

**Speaker B:** Right. Maybe 30 minutes in advance or so. If you got to get up at 5 o'clock, up at 4:30. Yep, right, because you programmed it. I'm going to be up by 5 o'clock. So that is so many other things that have to do with this building up of the confidence, because that confidence is the key. The lion, that lion's roar, you have to develop that ability. I know I can do this. Is a major part of the practice of the teaching and the teachings of the Buddha, because we all start off as victims. We all start off as children that are incapable of doing anything. Very few of us ever wind up getting that "I can do this," that can-do attitude, and almost always when that does happen, it happens to ordinary people who still have ordinary frustrations, but they do realize their goals. They get what they want. Question is, can they do it happily or not? Well, that's what we're wanting, is we're wanting to get that happiness and be able to do anything we want to do and be a champion at it. And so this is an easy example to play with if you've got a friend who'll play this game with you, though she doesn't even know that you started initiating a game that's going to bring great joy in your lives. Tease her. Can you hold your foot still? If she can hold her foot still, that's actually mental development. That's Sati Bhavana. Citta Bhavana. Can she hold her foot still while you tickle it? Did she keep her mouth shut when you tickled that? It's the same practice, you see. She comes in with unwholesome thoughts and tickles you into talking, and now you can shut your mouth. You don't have to say anything.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So she comes and tickles your foot, and you don't have to have those autonomic responses in the leg. You can take control of that leg and not move.

**Speaker A:** Yep.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so I'll give this— everything becomes Dharma, huh?

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, I'm definitely gonna play with that one.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so we play a lot. We've got the dogs. The puppy is really, really playful. She's growing up now, and so, uh, every evening for us is literally a pillow fight in the sense of, uh throwing the pillow from one person to another, and the one who's not looking gets hit in the head with it.

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker B:** Okay. But actually, it's to keep the dog. So in fact, if I want the dog to jump on Tam, I'll throw the ball or the bear that she's chewing on or whatever play toy she's got just on the other side of Tam. And then the puppy, when she comes through, is going to be bouncing right on Tam's tummy. So we, uh, we practice this way. But by doing that, now I'm actually teaching Piti how to throw and control her throwing. Those Thais are notorious for not being able to play baseball. They can't. They've got an, uh, a Thai injunction is that it's disrespectful to throw. So nobody throws anything. She could be a foot from me, 10, and I throw her, toss her the keys, and she's got her hand out and she can't catch it. She can't catch the keys. But now she's actually beginning to pick up those hand coordinations that most Americans pick up quite naturally. The Thais don't have it. This is socially against the rules to throw things. Anything, any reasons. Well, if they can't even toss the keys to her a foot away without her missing them, but now she can catch them easy enough.

**Speaker A:** Well, if they can learn to catch, then, uh, I can learn to clean out the mind. There you go.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. Learning how to catch a ball is exactly what we do to clean out the mind. Can you catch the ball? You know, you've heard me talk about the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. Well, in this case, what we need to do instead of catching the ball is make sure that it doesn't hit us, that we can get out of the way of it. But it's exactly the same skill, except instead of being hand-eye coordination, it's more like mind-mind coordination. So that you could see that insult coming and skip right out of the way. And once you go, oh, you missed me. But most of us spend our whole lives making ourselves targets. And so when those slings and arrows of outrageous fortune even are missing us, we'll go stand in the way to make sure that we get hit by it. Who are you talking to? You know, that kind of mentality. Is it that we want to get hit by the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune? And in a way, Westerners are very good at that, to where the Thais have the ability to just— And so hand-eye coordination has that quality to it. This is part of martial arts that people who develop really good, strong eye coordination, eye-hand coordination, actually means a lot of stuff. When you see that ball, for instance, coming through the air, you know that the human brain actually has to do the trajectory of what is the curve of the ball and where it's going to land so that we can get ready and have the hands ready for where it comes by. Okay, that's a whole lot of anticipation. It is a skill when it's used wholesomely, but in the West we use that skill very unwholesomely to try to figure out where the insults are coming so that we can stand there and say, it's me that you're hitting, I caught that ball. Okay, I even have to work sometimes really hard to catch those balls when in fact those are Dukkha. Balls the Dukkha people are throwing around all the time. Then in fact, if we go back to now what we were talking about before, she's out there throwing her little Dukkha balls, right? Are you going to stand in the way and get hit by them, or are you going to be sharp enough to get out of the way? Can I remain noble?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So in a way, you could say that all the training is a twofold training, in the sense, can I stop throwing balls at myself on the inside of my mind? Then the second training is, when other people are throwing those balls, can I get out of the way? And it's the same training, kind of.

**Speaker A:** I can do it. There you go.

**Speaker B:** I can do it. That's it. That's the whole point. Yeah, you put it in a way that I understand it, and of course I can do it. That's the Samma Sanghappa, that, uh, that life force that we have. That, uh, in Thai is called chi wit chi wa, but you hear that word chi, which is the Chinese version. Okay, chi, uh, in English we use words like mojo. The can-do attitude, that's the thing that needs to be developed in a wholesome way, because it can be developed and many people have it, but they don't use it in a wholesome way. And like we were saying before, Elon Musk is a good example. Many good politicians are like that. They've got that force, 'I can do this,' but they're very unwholesome about it. And probably one that we could have as an example of that is Donald Trump. He is slimy. He is so slimy because he has that attitude, look how slimy I am, I'll slip right out of your hands again, Mr. Law. I can get away with anything. Okay, now that's extremely unwholesome. But it is a kind of power, that mental attitude of, 'I could do it, I could do it, got it.' Most people never develop that kind of attitude, and a few do it unwholesomely and cause all kinds of problems for themselves and others. Wow. But if you could do that Get that mojo, get that can-do attitude, get that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa going in you. Become a Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. Okay, in fact, he recommends that everybody can be Bhikkhuni. Just practice, you could do it. And so, uh, I've been talking about this, you know, for a long time, but I think that we need to do even more emphasize it so that the students can really grasp a hold of that. You can do this. This is not the way that I've heard people talk about it many, many years ago, and from time to time now, that, oh, there's nobody been enlightened for hundreds of years. I'm going to work really hard at it. Maybe we could do it. Sort of kind of like pragmatic Dharma, pragmatic Buddhism, you know, saying, well, let's go in and figure out what they did wrong so that we could take it and get it right. And not understanding that, no, it hasn't ever been lost. That mojo is there, okay? And that's one of the things also that I wanted to point out with Prajna, that he's got that starting for himself. He's got that, that kind of an attitude. We could do this, we've got this wired. And that story that he told about recognizing that, oh, his face is broken out because he got a statue dirty when he was a kid in Thailand and got busted about it. And so instead of cleaning the statue, would have been the right thing to do, he ran away with the dirt on the face of statue, and he became that statue. Now, that's a really, really good example of how karma works. That's the action— the action of putting that dirt on it and not cleaning it up and being left with the guilt. And then he even forgets the incident up here in this part of the brain, but this part of the brain remembers it. The the part that controls the skin. And so, um, that's something to begin to understand, that, uh, that that's part of the training that the monks have. Whether or not you catch them believing in things like rebirth and reincarnation, the actual point that I would say— that's why it's irrelevant. You know, people talk to me about it and say, oh, you don't believe in it and whatnot like that. And I keep pointing back that no, it's irrelevant only so long as you allow it to be relevant. Because you stop caring about whether it exists or not. And because it's part of the common language that they have in Thailand, you're an ordinary Thai monk, one who is really getting it going. Will speak in that magical language, but it's irrelevant that he does so other than he's talking to people who understand that magical language. But I have seen that with the monks on numbers of occasions, that when they're with nobles, they speak in a noble way, and when they're ordinary people, they speak in an ordinary way. It's a skill that I wouldn't care to develop, because Bhikkhu Buddhadasa didn't bother to develop that skill either. Okay, and so I would recommend also within your relationship to start acting in a noble way rather than going into the ignoble stuff or the magical thinking, whatnot like that. But belief in rebirth is only a problem when we want to use it out to our advantage, something when we see that it's actually irrelevant. I mean, if 5 years ago was irrelevant, but most people will really dwell on something bad that happened 5 years ago, and then they feel bad on a regular occasion by it, when we can get out of 5 years ago and be in the present moment, be here now. Then it doesn't matter whether it was 5 or 500 years. It doesn't matter. It's deep, dark past. And so, uh, rebirth and reincarnation are actually irrelevant teachings. But even the Buddha taught in that language to those who believed it. That's why the sutras are so difficult to understand, is because people who really have a hard confirmation bias for rebirth and reincarnation exist, they can find evidence of it in the Suttas. Which actually what they mean is, they don't understand what's going on, they don't understand the ways of the Buddha, that he's actually there building friendship and trust, because he understands their point of view. And one of the things that I wanted to do with Ajahn Prathet is not rub it in his face at all, but rather continue to speak in a noble way to the students. And he's going along right down with us on that. He's on it. I'm really glad that he's here. Very valuable for the students, uh, to have real monks in our group.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I'm really glad that he, uh, he ended up joining and kind of took to it so well.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I really am pleased. If we got a couple of more monks, that would be good too.

**Speaker A:** What was that?

**Speaker B:** I say it would be even better if we had 3 monks.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I, uh, he's, he's like the youngest guy at that spot there, probably, that that knows how to use a phone that well is my imagination. But, uh, you know, I'll be back there.

**Speaker B:** That might be a hindrance, but it should not be, uh, that much of an obstacle. Um, but it's at least a thought. Yes, no, uh, a lot of the senior elderly monks, especially those that are my age, the very best ones that you could get are the really old dudes. Who have really been around. They're also the ones less likely to be on the internet. Yeah, because the internet didn't exist for the first 50 to 70 years of their life.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you are very impressive with the, uh, with the computer given your age.

**Speaker B:** Because I know you're— yeah, well, I was— yeah, I was part of the star of the show with that. I was really, really lucky to be picked up at the age of 21 by IBM. And start working with mainframes at that young age. 1967, I remember it specifically. That year was the year I joined IBM.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I mean, it's like I— every— like my parents, you know, my dad, like still it's kind of like the phone is even a foreign object to him still in a way, in a certain way. So Just depends on, I feel like, how young you were when you started and how involved you are with it, and an attitude around it, probably. Probably mostly an attitude.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, in high school I was really into electronics. I had a ham radio that I built myself, and then I helped my friend Nathan Goldman get his on, and that I was actually kind of jealous because by the time we had finished his equipment, his was better than mine. He could pick— we could pick up stations on his ham radio better than I could on mine, uh, and, and other things like that. I was also really into sound, uh, tape, disc, that kind of stuff. And so that was my high school days. Then when I went into the Navy, I went into the Navy as a musician, but then started to work in the sound recording laboratory, which is back into the electronic part of music. But actual lay is that we actually cut platters for people. We also cut masters to be sent to the recording company that actually would press them so that we could distribute music. I mean, this was a very high-quality sound recording laboratory that the Navy operated at the Naval School of Music, but it was all musicians. There was not an ET, electronic technician, in the group. They were all musicians. But because I was in that sound record— by the way, the reasons that there are no ETs is because all the ETs were on board ships. Maintaining the electronic equipment on board ships. No pay billets for the recording laboratory, but they managed to get enough people who had that kind of experience with that. So it was because of that. Then here's something else that a lot of people don't know, and that is IBM Corporation is still a major big corporation in America. Because of what happened in World War II. You could literally say that IBM owns the United States Navy. Everything that the Navy does with high-tech is IBM that does it. They, uh, that's just been the way that it was. Maybe not 100% now. But generally IBM has been really, really tight with the Navy, including that when people— that was a time when IBM was on a major hiring expedition because they had just come out with the 360 mainframe, first big real mainframe with real chips in it. So that was why I was hired, because I had already been doing electronics in the Navy, and so they scoffed me up and gave me an education. So by 1973, I had a Master's in Electrical Engineering, which was way beyond what I ever expected to be able to do. But along the way, I can do this, I can do this, I can do this, right into a Master's of Electrical Engineering. Very rare, not many people you'll find with that kind of credentials. But that was— it's basically what I'm saying is it is a combination of hardware and software. We're the kind of guys that drive— that write the drivers or develop USB, that kind of thing. Okay. And so now things are so, uh, built on top of each other, and all my training was right down there at the bottom. Bottom layer between software and hardware. So I know Windows pretty well, because it's an operating system. In fact, that was my specialty, was operating systems. So I know Linux, and I know Unix, and I know a lot of languages. But nowadays, it's all on the internet, and I was already a monk by the time the internet came by, so I've got no training in it, other than just picking stuff up. But old men like me, they didn't have the basis that I have. They can't pick it up. My mother could not learn to use computer even though she used a typewriter. She just could not use a computer, terrified of it.

**Speaker A:** I know the type. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Well, um, Back to the point about that, but we will find monks. That in fact, I would rather have a monk like Ajahn Pritit rather than one of the really old masters anyway. Someone closer to your age. But that's one of the things I know happens is that people point at old Dhammarato and he says, "Oh well, he's been around too many corners." And I'll never get to that place, you know, but when you've got young monks who have that budding mojo that I could see in Ajahn Pritik.

**Speaker A:** I.

**Speaker B:** Think that that's also what Ajahn Santi could see in Eric. You saw it in Eric. And if there's any— anything, one thing that would be able to define Eric for you is that he's got an attitude. And I'm really, really happy that that attitude shone brightly and he was seen. Some old master up in Royette has grabbed his butt and taken him and putting him in training.

**Speaker A:** That's great. Is he— yeah, that's wonderful. I mean, we talked about, you know, we talked about potentially making it out to Thailand when he was here, and, you know, that how it was just a couple of different steps away and I know he went to Alaska after he left Chicago at some point. And then I figure, you know, Thailand seems like the next logical step after Alaska. After a couple of bear encounters—.

**Speaker B:** Oh, he really saw the bears?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, he told me, uh, he told me he got out of his car and approached one. That was very nice.

**Speaker B:** Well, there is a— you know that we've talked about that being sick is a really excellent time to practice. Sometimes also we have to test ourselves. And one of the things that we do want to test ourselves is, how do we handle danger? You know, the Buddha was known for being fearless, that in fact the original Bodh Gaya that he stayed in, the reason why it was so secluded was because it was well known by the entire population that this was a haunted place, this was a dangerous place, this was in the swamps with snakes and alligators and great big freeze and all that kind of stuff. Probably some swamp gas to go along with it, but downright spooky. You know, some haunted houses are haunted just because they feel spooky. There's something about the air that's there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's actually what I, what I wrote about, uh, with Eric in that, in that paper. Quite a lot about how fearless he was. And actually, I left out probably a lot of other stuff that I could have mentioned too, um, to do with that, like him, him going hunting for the elk at night and things like that.

**Speaker B:** But, uh, no, here's something fearless for you, though I don't recommend you, you practice in Chicago. That's not the right place to practice, but practice going barefoot. That's a dangerous thing to do.

**Speaker A:** I did a lot of barefoot.

**Speaker B:** Watch every step, every step you can step on something you don't want to step on.

**Speaker A:** I did a lot of barefoot when I was out there in Olympic, but Eric had done a lot of barefoot as well, and I think he had done a lot of it and decided he wanted to go a bit of a middle ground, a middle path with it. So he kind of wears these, or he had these shoes They kind of like call them like barefoot shoes or very minimal. Yeah, you could— he actually gave me a pair. He had an extra pair, and so when I went to Yosemite, I wore those the entire time. It was really nice. You feel everything.

**Speaker B:** You know what, if it's the same thing, these are Moccasins. I had them. In fact, they're common in Oklahoma. But basically, the bottom of the shoe is just one piece of cowhide, just the leather from one cow skin. Well, guess what? So is your foot, just one leather of cow skin. And basically, when you're wearing those moccasins, you can feel right through them. But they're not quite so dangerous.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, you probably won't get cut as easily or something like that, right?

**Speaker B:** Right. But yeah, you notice, like, if you're not watching where you're going, you still need to watch where you're going, otherwise you're going to tear up those shoes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, any, any rock, any, any rock you step on, you're going to know it, you're going to feel it good.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. Uh, they, they do that also in Thailand by having flip-flops that are actually quite thin.

**Speaker A:** Well, you know what, actually, they— there's like a whole market around the whole barefoot thing that there's— I looked it up afterward and I found there's companies that even sell what looks like a dress shoe, what looks like a work shoe, but you can, you know, covertly you know, without anyone really knowing, you're basically barefoot even though you look like you're wearing, you know, office attire.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's the way to get in touch with Mother Earth, is by touching her instead of walking high above her on a heavy set of boots. Yes. Um, yeah, but that's the whole point about military equipment. Is that in fact, the Buddha talked about if you wear shoes, let them be open-topped, that in fact, cowboy boots would not be recommended for a monk to wear, because it's supposed to do protection, bottom and top too, that it's actually the leggings for the protection for warriors that they will put battle armor on, and that includes a boot. Or if it's a shoe that doesn't have a high top to it, they'll strap metal to that lower part of the leg down to the instep. Okay, so, but the monks, we practice going barefoot, but if we do, we want to have open shoes, open top, open ankle, open shin. For one thing, it's a whole lot cheaper.

**Speaker A:** You know, in a way, I think it might actually be safer too, because my Esther, she ended up rolling her ankle on one of the really easy— like, we were walking somewhere, it wasn't particularly difficult. But there's a spot and I kind of needed to jump off or like kind of slide off of this rock and she ended up rolling her ankle on it. She was wearing these pretty heavy-duty, uh, these sneakers that are kind of made to, to be, you know, kind of feel like boots basically. Um, you know, it's very good to.

**Speaker B:** Trust them rather than trusting where she's going, right?

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Watching Right, exactly. So without the boot, or without that, like, because I was wearing, you know, the barefoot one, so I just had to be really careful about it. But she's probably just, you know, oh, I can just stomp around in these however, and she just probably stomped on her ankle.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that's exactly what we're talking about, is that having very, very light shoes, mossakins are actually Wearing our own Mokshikas, our own thick feet.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it kind of reminds me of something I had heard a while back about helmets and bikes and how, you know, I don't know, it's probably a good idea to wear a helmet, but I think the people were getting at that, like, not wearing a helmet, you're inclined to really pay attention to what you're doing and you know, the— I think they were trying to make an argument that not wearing a helmet was just as safe as wearing a helmet.

**Speaker B:** Actually, it depends. That's true in some cases. It's true in some circumstances. If the child, uh, relies upon the helmet, then he's going to get hurt.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** If he relies upon watching where he's going without a helmet he'll be less hurt. But if he uses the helmet as the extra protection, just in case— but mostly he's watching where he's going because he knows he doesn't want to crack open his skull.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so there's that 3 levels of it. And I would say that when mom tells the kid to wear the helmet, she's putting him in danger. Better thing to do is to let him fall off his bike and bump his noggin and then say, hey, you want a helmet?

**Speaker A:** It's a good point. I, I've been, uh, do they have a lot of scooters out there in Thailand?

**Speaker B:** 90% of all traffic on this island is scooters.

**Speaker A:** Or not, not scooters, not, not the, uh, moped.

**Speaker B:** I'm talking like mopeds. These are big 90cc, uh, Honda.

**Speaker A:** Not that kind of scooter, like the, the kid kind of scooter, like the push your— push one leg kind of scooter.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I haven't seen those. No, I— yes, I have, but it's only an occasional farang that will bring one with his backpack.

**Speaker A:** Well, well, in America it's like a big thing now to have not that kind of scooter, but now an electric kind of scooter. So, you know, you're standing on it, as you know, that kind of child toy kind of scooter, but it's electric. A lot of people use it to get around, and I've used it quite a bit.

**Speaker B:** In fact, this is the brand new second edition of the Segway. The problem with the Segway is that they had the tires side by side, Now they've just taken the Segway and put it in linear like a bicycle, and the kids on it with wheels about this big. And yeah, those things are fun to ride. I've never been on one, but I know what they are.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I know, they're pretty nice, and they're like on every block. You can just grab one, like, you know, they have bike share. Do they have bike share in Thailand?

**Speaker B:** No, no, there's no need.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, no, probably not. I guess not. Yeah, but they have them like all over.

**Speaker B:** And so motorbikes are very, very common here.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but that's one of the things I hear about the scooters is it's like incredibly dangerous, of course, because like you're going pretty fast because it's electric maybe, and you know, that could happen. But I was thinking about getting— I.

**Speaker B:** Was heard that they've actually intentionally— that you could make a scooter just like that go 100 miles an hour. Yeah, it'll kill anybody who tries. And so they generally limit them at about 20 miles an hour, and they still have a whole lot of accidents.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, they're, they're pretty fun to ride though. I kind of, I like it. I was thinking about getting one myself because it, it's also like very convenient, more convenient I feel like than Waiting on a bus.

**Speaker B:** Sure, if you buy the right one, you could pull this knob and lower the handle and the seat and pick it up and carry it like a suitcase. And you can walk right in and set it by your office desk.

**Speaker A:** And, uh, or some people do the, uh, you know, that basically they have the scooter without the handles, so you're just like standing on it.

**Speaker B:** Like a skateboard, powered skateboard.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I've heard those are more like a tiny unicycle.

**Speaker B:** Oh, but it's got the balance equipment to keep them, because real unicycle takes a whole lot of practice to learn to ride. But now they've got unicycles that'll sit up by themselves.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and those, and those go like 20 miles per hour too, like really fast. And like, yeah. That's, uh, whenever I see those, I'm like, that's pretty interesting. That might take some— that might be a good test as well, right?

**Speaker B:** Right. If you— that, uh, in fact, all of the motorcycling that I have done, I would, uh, consider that introduction into the Dhamma. That watching where you're going, being able to do things that are kind of weird for realest. One of the times, in fact, I wasn't driving, I was riding on the back with Randy, and the cops were chasing us. And so he passed this bus on a two-lane highway with a semi coming right, and we were just between the two of them as they passed, and we had to duck to miss the mirrors. On both of them. First this one, and then this one again. I have to duck to keep from hitting the mirrors. That's the kind of stuff that Randy was doing. And so I learned to ride with him. He was crazy, but he was fearless. And so I learned to ride fearlessly with him.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, my dad is just like that. He has a lot of stories about doing a lot of crazy stuff in the car. And, um, you know riding his, uh, like, sports car under an 18-wheeler or something like that. Something you see in a movie, something you see in a Bond movie.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's basically— to be able to do that is the can-do attitude, that you can do that. Most people would be terrified to put a bike under a semi and then pop it back up and ride on by. There's a certain way that you got to do it to slide, to get the bike down so that it turns around, to get just the G-force to where you can put it back upright again. And that can be done, but you got to have the confidence that you could do it. And sometimes the confidence is not all, you need some skill too. So the skill and the confidence, and you could do all kinds of really weird stuff on motorbikes. And guess what? You can see all of that kind of stuff now on the internet. Now that we have cameras and daredevils, there's a lot of really interesting stuff that can happen.

**Speaker A:** Well, Eric used to, uh, ride a bike too. Go figure, huh? He used to be big.

**Speaker B:** I'll have to put that on my list of good students. Students who have done karate, students who have done music, students who have done math, and now we have to do daredevils. If you're a daredevil, you're half the Dharma. To pull that fearlessness out and say, I can do that, I don't have to be afraid. Possibly an example of that is Evel Knievel. Have you ever heard of him? He's been dead now for years, but the joke is that he broke every bone in his body, one after another after another, 200 times before he learned to ride that motorbike.

**Speaker A:** I've heard of him.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, but he drew, he drew great audiences just to see if he'd crash this time or not, because he didn't disappoint him. He crashed often, but he'd get out of the hospital, put his motorbike back together, and go do something really crazy. I think he was the one who actually took a motorbike and lived through it and jumped all the way across the Grand Canyon someplace or another. And so that's again that quality that we were speaking about earlier of having that 'can do'— I could do this. I'll either do it or it kills me, kind of. And that's what the Buddha was doing in that swamp. He said, "I am not going to be running away because of my fear." In fact, he practiced that when he was fearful, he would stop and wait until he was no longer afraid, and then he would take the next step.

**Speaker A:** That's what you told me.

**Speaker B:** Huh?

**Speaker A:** That's what you told me to do. Uh, remember when we talked about, uh, in the woods at night, getting— you aren't lost when you don't know where you're going or whatever, that kind of thing. Just stop.

**Speaker B:** Just stop. Figure out, well, so far so good, I've gotten myself to this point. With fear, I can move on now fearlessly. I actually do remember a time at Wat Soi Mokkh that here I was. It actually— I remember that it was a gravel path because I'd gotten off the path. I could tell the difference between that path and not path, and I wandered right into— it was black, it was so dark. First off, it's in the jungle. Second off, there was no power, any lights or anything, or any electricity anywhere within probably a kilometer or so, and no moon. No moon, no stars, just the canopy of the forest. Black, but still not black enough to be blind, that you could still see if you train the eyes. But if you're out there afraid, then you can't. You gotta cool, settle down, just like you. You remember being off in the woods, very little light out at night. But let's get the mind going. We could do this.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I remember that initially. I really could not tell the difference between opening and closing my eyes. It was like the same thing.

**Speaker B:** And yet if you keep looking, you'll begin to see things. Oh, that's a log there. Oh, this is the tree that I just run into.

**Speaker A:** Afterward, Eric and I were— we walked around in the dark and we just tried to like see how far we could go, like see if we could, you know, stay on the path at night. I think we tried it in the daytime too, just like close your eyes. And see if you could just, you know, feel the path.

**Speaker B:** That's one of the things that I did in India. They call it a blind trust walk. You can do it with one guide and several people who have on blindfolds, or you can just have two people. But basically what you do is, if you're the guide, you're going to make noises that the people can hear that are blinded so that they could follow along with you, like cough or even yell at them or whatever, like that, this way, or maybe stomp around. And so you begin to see through the hearing of who you're with, and you can begin to find all kinds of things. One of the things that happened while I was doing that, I was actually on a blind trust walk in town, which is even worse than being out in the forest, okay? In town with all the cars and traffic and all of that kind of stuff. And here I am on a blind trust walk, and I, at one time, I remember so profoundly, what the hell is this in front of me? But it was kind of a, a really, really queer kind of strange lines through it and all that, big And that— and so I said, wait a minute, I'm going to take these blindfold off. I got to see what this is that I could see, feel with my body and the structure, but I couldn't see it with my eyes. And I took that blindfold off, and you know what it was? It was a bicycle parking place that had too many bicycles, and they were just jumbled all over the place. And I could see that, but I couldn't tell what it was, but I could see it. Without the eyes. And that's when I began to understand that the body is kind of an antenna. We pick up all kinds of stuff. The human body is electromagnetic, and we can pick up that electromagnetic stuff if we're paying attention to it. This is part of the reasons why it's really hard to sneak up on an Arahant. It's because they're paying attention to their surroundings. This is the whole training with the Zen stick. Do you know that guy's there? If you don't know he's there, he's going to hit you with that stick to let you know he's there. And so this is the whole quality of wakey-wakey. Start watching what's going on. And that's why going out in the woods like you and Eric did is such a marvelous thing. I know it had a profound impact on you. Just one week.

**Speaker A:** It was two.

**Speaker B:** Double dose. And with Eric, maybe times four.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's funny, that antenna, because I had the thought earlier that— or the experience rather— of being in a— having something on the mind and you— and then you catch it that you were caring about that thing, and then the coming out of it, basically it's like, oh, uh, look at me caring about that thing. I don't have to care about that anymore. I'm just going to go back to, uh, what's here now, the breath and all the things in the senses, because there's nothing else to do but just to enjoy. Nothing to do, right?

**Speaker B:** There's no place to go or nothing.

**Speaker A:** So when you do that, it's just whatever's in sensory awareness to take in and to note and to enjoy.

**Speaker B:** Well, now we know what to do when unwholesome things arise in your partner is shut your mouth, get yourself into that really good state that we're talking about. And then offer something noble. I think one of the easy ones is, wow, you're so beautiful when you're angry. That really, really gets them.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Then we can hone in on it. Like, you, you, do you know that you wrinkle your nose when you're angry? And start putting things in there like that to bring them into the here and now. Okay, our teaser— that goes also back to the tickling of the feet. Begin to tease her. Have a very light, happy relationship with her. You've got the mojo, you could do it. And if you don't, she'll win and pull you into her pity party, whatever she's doing.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I'll keep that in mind. I'm gonna have to rewatch this again. But.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, let's finish now. This has been a really joyful conversation. I really enjoyed this one. Thank you so much.

**Speaker A:** Per usual, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** All right, okay, well, we'll see you later.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye, till next time.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) with a Sangha friend (Speaker A), focuses on transforming interpersonal conflict into a spiritual practice, emphasizing mindfulness, mental control, and cultivating a "noble" state of mind.

Here is a summary of the key themes and teachings:

**Core Teaching: Turning Conflict into Practice**
The central discussion revolves around Speaker A's experience with his partner's "unwholesome" or negative emotional state. Dhammarato reframes this not as a problem, but as a prime **opportunity for practice**. The challenge is to remain "noble-minded" (peaceful, kind, wise) when someone close is trying to pull you into negativity.

**The Practical Method: From Shutting Up to Wholesome Speech**
1.  **Shut Your Mouth:** The first and crucial step when confronted with negativity is to stop the automatic, reactive speech. This is compared to the discipline of an *Anagami* (a non-returner in Buddhist practice) who doesn't let unwholesome thoughts manifest as speech.
2.  **Change Your Inner State:** Use the silence to actively shift your own mind back to a wholesome, joyful, and noble state through mindfulness (like *Anapanasati*, mindfulness of breathing).
3.  **Speak Only Wholesomely:** Once your mind is settled, engage again, but only with kind, positive, or skillful speech. This creates a new, positive reality and can actually influence the other person's state.

**Building the "Can-Do" Mojo: Confidence and Mental Control**
A major theme is developing unshakable confidence (*samma sankappa*, right intention) or "mojo"—the conviction that "I can do this." This is built through small, playful practices:
*   **The Tickling Game:** Used as a metaphor for mental control. By learning not to jerk your foot when tickled, you practice overriding autonomic reactions, just as you learn not to react to verbal "ticks" or provocations.
*   **Programming the Mind:** Like waking up at a set time by intention, you can program your mind to respond with nobility instead of reactivity.
*   **Martial Arts & Danger:** Activities like motorcycling, martial arts, or walking in the dark are discussed as ways to cultivate fearlessness and hyper-awareness, which translate directly into the ability to remain calm in emotional "danger."

**Key Metaphors and Analogies**
*   **Catching Balls:** Don't stand in the path of the "dukkha balls" (suffering/insults) others throw. Develop the skill to see them coming and step aside, staying noble.
*   **Sitcom Idea:** A humorous proposed sitcom where a man uses these Dharma principles to skillfully and wholesomely defuse his girlfriend's negativity.
*   **Barefoot Walking:** Wearing minimal shoes forces mindful attention to every step, analogous to the careful attention needed to navigate relationships and one's own mind.

**Broader Context**
The talk also touches on:
*   The irrelevance of metaphysical beliefs (like literal rebirth) compared to the practical work of freeing the mind from past guilt and living in the present.
*   The value of having monks in the community who embody the practice.
*   Acknowledgment of students (like Eric) who exemplify the fearless, "can-do" attitude.

**Conclusion**
The talk is a guide to **transforming everyday life into Dharma practice**. The ultimate goal is to build such confident mental control and wholesome habit that one can remain joyful and noble under any pressure, thereby becoming a positive force that can cool down conflict and inspire others. The final advice is to keep interactions light, playful, and teasing where appropriate, always returning to a foundation of wholesome intent.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, here are the primary **metaphors and stories** used in the talk:

### **Metaphors & Analogies:**

1.  **Adam and Eve / The Talking Snake:** Used to illustrate blame-shifting in relationships ("the man blames the woman, and the woman says... it's your damn talking snake").
2.  **Noble vs. Ordinary Relationship:** A central metaphor framing interactions as either elevated ("noble") or petty/complaining ("ordinary").
3.  **Truckload of Snow in the Living Room:** Represents the cooling, transformative effect of maintaining a noble, wholesome attitude in the face of another's "heat" or negativity.
4.  **Dragon Mouth:** Metaphor for the unwholesome, reactive speech that must be controlled.
5.  **Anapanasati (Mindfulness of Breathing) as a Template:** The practice is extended beyond the breath to moments of conflict—"shutting the mouth" is likened to pausing the breath to regain composure.
6.  **Tickling Feet / Bodily Reflexes:** A playful metaphor for mental control and non-reactivity. Not jerking your foot when tickled is equated to not reacting verbally to provocation.
7.  **Programming the Mind (ROM vs. DRAM):** Using computer memory (Read-Only Memory vs. Dynamic RAM) as a metaphor for firm, unwavering intention versus temporary, changeable states.
8.  **The Lion's Roar / Mojo / Can-Do Attitude:** Represents the essential confidence and self-efficacy in practice.
9.  **Catching a Ball / Hand-Eye Coordination:** A metaphor for the unwholesome habit of anticipating and "catching" insults or emotional provocations ("Dukkha balls").
10. **Getting Out of the Way / Martial Arts:** The skillful alternative to "catching the ball"—developing the awareness to sidestep verbal or emotional attacks.
11. **Slimy (like Donald Trump):** Used as an example of unwholesome application of the "can-do" power or mojo.
12. **Barefoot Shoes / Moccasins:** Represent mindfulness and direct contact with experience (the earth), as opposed to the insulated, less-aware state of wearing heavy boots.
13. **Bicycle Helmets:** An analogy for how external protections (like helmets or thick shoes) can sometimes reduce mindful attention, whereas their absence increases careful awareness.
14. **The Body as an Antenna:** Suggests the body can perceive electromagnetic or subtle environmental cues, emphasizing heightened awareness.

### **Stories & Anecdotes:**

1.  **The Story in the Woods with Eric:** Referenced multiple times as a formative period of practice involving sickness, fear, and using a fallen log as a meditation object. It exemplifies learning mindfulness in difficult, primal conditions.
2.  **The Bear That Wasn't There:** A humorous, shared memory from the woods story highlighting perception and fear.
3.  **Prajna's Statue Story:** A story about a man (Prajna) who, as a child, dirtied a statue, felt guilty, and later developed skin problems—used as a karmic analogy for how unresolved actions manifest.
4.  **The Buddha in the Haunted Swamp (Bodh Gaya):** Referenced to illustrate fearlessness—the Buddha chose to practice in a place known to be feared and dangerous.
5.  **Dhammarato's Blind Trust Walk in India:** A story where, while blindfolded, he perceived a jumble of bicycles through senses other than sight, illustrating intuitive/body awareness.
6.  **Randy's Daredevil Motorcycle Ride:** A story of extreme, fearless bike riding (ducking between mirrors of a bus and a semi) used to exemplify the "can-do" attitude and focus.
7.  **Evel Knievel:** Referenced as a cultural icon of fearless (if reckless) determination.
8.  **Personal Anecdotes:**
    *   **Speaker A's walk:** Noticing his facial expression change with wholesome/unwholesome thoughts.
    *   **Speaker A's partner rolling her ankle:** Used to support the "barefoot shoes" metaphor about mindful attention.
    *   **Dhammarato's career path:** From Navy sound recording to IBM and electrical engineering, illustrating the development of skill and confidence.
    *   **Playful practices at home:** Pillow fights to train the dog (and Tam's) coordination, and tickling games as mental training.
    *   **Thai cultural note:** The anecdote about Thais having an injunction against throwing, affecting their hand-eye coordination.

These metaphors and stories collectively build a theme of **transforming everyday life—especially relational conflicts—into a training ground for mindfulness, non-reactivity, fearlessness, and wholesome intention.**
