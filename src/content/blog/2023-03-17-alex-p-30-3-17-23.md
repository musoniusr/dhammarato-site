### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, okay, yeah. Okay, yeah, so we were talking, Dhammarato, about how just basically what I've noticed in the past 2 months, the main things that I have made consistent in my practice. And I'd say those 2 things are one is noticing the unwholesome, so just noticing whatever it is that's unwholesome. And then the second, matching that with a kind of like neutral kind of accept, you know, everything is fine, acceptance, this is okay, everything is fine. And it doesn't— but here's what I want to work on with you, and this is where I think I might be next headed. Curious what you think is getting to more like sustaining the wholesome now, right? Learning to build and sustain the wholesome. We got really good at noticing the unwholesome and staying clear from it. But then I think the other, the skill probably next to develop is to build and sustain the wholesome, would you say? Or what do you think?

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, that's, that's correct. And there's really not that much to it. Um, the actual practice is very, very easy, but it has to be repeated over and over and over again. And, and as you've been repeating that and getting over and over and over again, you're beginning to see for sure what's wholesome and what's unwholesome thoughts. And then what comes next is a thought that arises that we can actually begin to understand now is that too is an unwholesome thought, because there is really nothing next.

**Speaker A:** Wait, wait, you said what's the Anagami thought?

**Speaker B:** What comes next. The reason you called— the what comes next is actually an unwholesome thought because it's based in there must be something next because I'm not there yet, which means I'm not good enough yet. So the right way to practice with that one is, aha, we don't need anything next. What we need to do is to stay right here. Imagine that it's something like this, and in fact this is kind of the way that it is described sometimes. Imagine that you're lost in the wilderness and that you don't know where the water is, about the only thing you know is what's uphill and what's downhill, but that tends to get confusing because you go uphill only to go downhill, and when you go downhill, there's only the uphill, but you're lost. Okay, and then you run across something, perhaps a stream or perhaps a path. And so what we do then is that we follow this path in the woods where we're lost knowing that the path must go back to civilization because it was people in civilization that had made this path. Or we can find a stream and recognize that at least with the stream it will continue to go downhill, and if it goes downhill, it will probably go someplace where there will be civilization so that I'm not lost anymore. Okay, so you get the analogy. All right, so now that you found the stream and are following the stream, you're still asking, well, where's the civilization? The answer to that is follow the stream.

**Speaker A:** Well, wait, what's the stream?

**Speaker B:** Well, okay, go back to the analogy. So you're lost in the wilderness, you're lost in the mountains. And you don't know where to go. But one of the things— I mean, there's things that we can do, like we can figure out what north is. That's easy enough, but that may not be useful. But then we can run across either a path in the woods, like a wagon path, maybe a dirt road. If we can find a dirt road, that dirt road will take us back to civilization. Or we can find a stream or a brook, maybe even a small riverlet, and we can follow that, and it will take us downhill, guaranteed, so that we will find civilization. It will eventually find big water and probably civilization, right? So you got that, that Here's another example of that, is that you've been weary and traveling and you wind up in a small town that's got a railway station, and you ask him and they say, oh, we don't know when the train's coming, but it'll be by. And so the thing to do is to wait at that train station until the train actually comes, and then we can get on the train and go. But if we get confused about, oh, I don't see where that train is, let me leave this station and continue my blind feeling around my lost journey. Okay, so this is these two analogies. Okay, so now that you've got it, is that once you get the path, Once you get the Dharma path, there's going to be these questions come up, but the answer is always stay on that path. Don't get off path. If you do get off the path, don't get too far off so that you can find it again.

**Speaker A:** Is the path self-defined?

**Speaker B:** Well, we're talking about the Eightfold Noble Path now. I use the word path intentionally.

**Speaker A:** Okay, all right, okay.

**Speaker B:** So now that you've got it, that the Eightfold Noble Path does work, that's what we have to keep going. That's in fact a major portion of the path that the Buddha talks about, or let us say, of the Seven Knowledges that leads one into no nobility. That knowledge and vision of what is the path and is not the path is the third aspect. Okay, and so you've basically already come to the position that this is the path. You found it. You've got the right path. And now you're basically asking questions about where the path is going to lead. And the answer is we don't know the future. We just know that we're on the right path.

**Speaker A:** Well, not— I love what you're saying here. It's not so much that I want to know where it leads. I mean, I want to know that too, but what I was asking about directly was what would be the next step on the path, because every path has a step.

**Speaker B:** Exactly the same as the last step that you were on the path. Okay, okay, okay. But you've got the path, and all you have to do is stay on it one step at a time, one breath at a time.

**Speaker A:** So you're saying just basically just keep doing what I'm doing?

**Speaker B:** Basically just keep doing what you are doing now and begin to enjoy it because you know that it's the correct path. See, you've still got a little bit of doubt in there. About is this the right path. But you already have overcome it. I mean, that's the whole point, is that sometimes there's a little bit of doubt, but when I question you about it, no, there's no doubt. We know that this is the path.

**Speaker A:** Well, isn't there like— isn't the point to go into the Jhanas and stuff?

**Speaker B:** Well, when you're asking about it, you're not there. But when you're saying everything is okay, everything is fine, wow, this is nice, that's the entry into the Jhana. And we don't need Jhana. In fact, I would say that the teachings about Jhana in Western Buddhism is a trap that keeps people from being able to do the Jhana. For sure, because you have to— in order to be in the first Jhana, you've got to be satisfied. You've got to have the Sukkha. You've got to have the— in fact, those are the definitions of being safe, secure, comfortable, satisfied, and successful. And we apply the mind to that and sustain the mind to that. And when you ask the question, well, what's next? That means that you don't quite have the success, you don't quite have the satisfaction, but keep going towards satisfaction. Keep going towards everything is okay, everything is fine, no worries, and that that's good enough. That's the quality of it, is that it becomes enough. There's nothing left to do. The job that needed to be done has already been done. And the way that I talk about it is, is that the job that needs to be done is to tear up the to-do list rather than ticking off each item of the to-do list as it's been done. So in this regard, then, you're asking about, well, what's the next item on the list? And the answer to that is tear up that to-do list. You've already arrived. Enjoy the fact that you've already arrived. And when you get that feeling deeply, deeply that you have arrived, that's brilliant. I mean, what a relief it is to actually figure out that you've got it, that you've arrived, that there's no place to go yet, that this is good enough for the rest of your life.

**Speaker A:** How do you figure that one out? How do you see that?

**Speaker B:** Well, we keep practicing. This moment is good enough. This moment is good enough. This moment is satisfying. And so we begin to build that up as a habit.

**Speaker A:** Good.

**Speaker B:** And so this is that right effort. One's right effort is to keep throwing out the doubts about what's the next step. And say, this step is good enough.

**Speaker A:** This step is good enough.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, this step is good enough. And you see, in our culture, there are so many things that will keep us dissatisfied. We don't have enough knowledge, we haven't read all the Dharma books, or I haven't attained that, or I haven't attained this. And so we start off in dissatisfaction and stay in the state of dissatisfaction. To where the Buddha is talking about, no, let's stop those dissatisfying thoughts and start having satisfying thoughts instead. And pretty soon, by having satisfying thoughts, you begin to feel satisfied. The feelings will be there for satisfaction. But if you keep having unsatisfying thoughts, then you'll feel unsatisfied. So the place to start is with having satisfactory thoughts. This is good enough, this is fine, I got this one, I can breathe this breath, I can take this sigh, and kind of stay in here now rather than worrying about what the next step is. This step is good enough. To nourish yourself. Alex, Alex, this step is good enough. You made it, man. You can handle this moment, and it's just okay. And you don't have to worry about what comes next. But we have to keep doing this, repeating it over and over and over again. So the next step is going to be the same as the last step. Repeat it. What step is that? The step of feeling safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. And if you keep doing that, then the feeling of success will arise, the confidence. I can do this. Look, I can do it, I can do it. And then I have that thought about what's the next step, and I can throw that out and I can just keep going. It's good enough. I have everything that I need. I've got the air to breathe, and I've got the chair to sit in, and I've got the peace of mind to just sit here and enjoy. And you don't need anything else. Then in fact, in many cases, people would have been a whole lot better without Buddhism. Because they approach Buddhism with just one more thing to want. Just one more thing to want is where we get in, in, into it. And, and basically, why? What is— because we like it. You like the fact that you can take one step on the path. You like that you can give yourself a little bit of success. You like it that you can feel a little bit comfortable. You like it that you can feel a little bit safe, and you want more of that. And the answer to that is easy enough in the sense that you go back and you practice that feeling safe enough Feeling secure enough, feeling satisfied enough, and pretty soon that enough feeling will kick in. This is good enough. We can put that in. Yeah. So this— you found the path. You're not lost in the woods anymore. You've got a path. Let's stay on the path one step at a time. This moment is good enough. Eventually the path will lead someplace. We don't even know where. But let's stay on the path.

**Speaker A:** All right, very good, man, very good. No, I'm, um, very pleased. Um, you know, my, my whole, uh, work situation has changed over the past 3 weeks as well. I started doing really well at work, um, with sales. I just decided, I was like, well, if I'm gonna end up doing— I don't know, I don't know. I just realized it was easy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's the whole point. You never wind up. Now people get wound up, but the only thing that you'll ever wind up is dead. Other than that, everything is just process, and we never finish. You've heard people talk about a story about this, and then they'll say, and finally he did this. Okay, another clear example of that is that I was looking for— let's say my eyeglasses— I was looking for the cell phone, and I finally found it. I find— you hear that? Finally. I finally found it in the last place I looked. Well, of course it's going to be found in the last place that you looked. Of course it's going to be. Why would you continue to look for it after you found it? That makes no sense at all. Okay, so this is the whole idea then, is that it is the the search or the walking of the path that is the path. And the problem with the search is, is if we want something rather than just merely being enthusiastic about whatever it is we're going to find, because we don't know what we're going to find as we walk down the path. So we can be open to anything. All kinds of marvelous possibilities could happen. But when we want one of them, then we're pining because we don't have it. That's almost like walking down the path and you see a wishing tree over to the side, and you go over to the wishing tree. Oh, I wish I was this, and I wish I was that. And while we're standing under the wishing tree, we're not on the path. And what is the path? One step at a time. This is good enough. This is fine. No place to go and nothing to do. And wow, I can feel just okay. Got no worries.

**Speaker A:** No worries over here.

**Speaker B:** No, right. So that's the way that we practice, is to have those very wholesome thoughts and recognize when those unwholesome thoughts come in. The thoughts about the wishing tree, the thoughts about what's next.

**Speaker A:** You know, because.

**Speaker B:** That'S what we've been doing all along anyway. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So I want to talk to you about like how some of this stuff applies to practical things in life, right? So like women is a big one, right? So I'm on these dating apps, okay, and Yeah, I go on these dating apps often. I enjoy spending time on the dating apps though. I enjoy talking to different kinds of women and flirting and being playful and using the Dhamma to my advantage in that way, you know, just having fun. But at the same time, I've noticed that it can have a tendency to take me away from the path, I guess you could say.

**Speaker B:** Oh, that wishing tree has all kinds of naked women on it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Oh man.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that's the whole point, is, is that that wishing thing is in the mind. So, um, I think that we had talked about this a long time ago, uh, but it— maybe it's a better thing to do now that you're doing it with these, these apps, is to, um— I— do you remember me talking to you about Sati Hawkins? About, maybe about, about leap year. Leap year is Sadie Hawkins, the 29th of February. Every 4 years in some traditions, that's the women's day, uh, for dating. And in fact, one of the students says that there, uh, at his high school they had a Sadie Hawkins dance. Um, not, not a whole evening of this, but one of the, uh, the numbers that they played was for the Sadie Hawkins, and that's when the girl chooses the boy. Normally in our society, the boy has to go up to the girl and he's the one that's all, uh, uptight because he's of the fear of rejection. Okay, so one of the ways that you can handle this wishing tree that we've started to talk about is let them take the lead. Don't ask them for a date or things like that. Just enjoy the moment with them. Okay, just, just enjoy the moment without expectations.

**Speaker A:** I like that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, then, then that makes it really easy to stay on the path. Yeah, but when we start wanting things—.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, wait a minute, but if I really vibe, if I really connect with someone, like, and I don't have— well.

**Speaker B:** If you connect with her, then won't she be seeing that she's connecting with you? Or is this your— just your imagination that you're connecting with her and she don't want nothing to do with you?

**Speaker A:** Oh, it could be that too, but yes, I know.

**Speaker B:** But the really important one is when she feels like she's connecting with you. Right. Yeah. And that's a whole lot easier for women to do when they're not being chased down the street.

**Speaker A:** But how— but what if she's waiting for me to make a move to ask her on a date?

**Speaker B:** Well, you can— let us say you can nudge her in that kind of direction. You can ask her questions. But don't come out and, and be the, um, the male, or yeah, just, you know, just handle it. Then in fact, uh, um, the question that you just asked would be more appropriate 100 years ago, maybe even 70 years ago. But in modern times, times were changing anyway.

**Speaker A:** No, I like this. Thank you. Just enjoy the moment you're talking to them. I like that a lot. Um, okay.

**Speaker B:** And so go on the dating apps, enjoying the company that you have in the moment. And if there's any connections being made, let those connections be made in her mind. That in fact— listen to her questions very carefully. She may be giving you hints.

**Speaker A:** For sure, for sure.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** So that's something I'd like to talk to you about.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, if we got that one easy— that was easy enough. We got 3 of them now.

**Speaker A:** That was easy, man. Yeah, our conversations are a lot faster. Um, okay, okay. So this is about— this is about marijuana. I don't know if there's something you want to take offline, or it's okay if we talk about it here.

**Speaker B:** There's— there's no problem with it now.

**Speaker A:** Good.

**Speaker B:** Because, I mean, I mean, when it was illegal, it had ramifications, but now.

**Speaker A:** That it's legal— illegal federally, but.

**Speaker B:** Well, it depends. I mean, nobody's getting busted anymore. Oh, Joe Biden, Joe Biden just let a whole bunch of, um, users, um, out of, um, federal charges.

**Speaker A:** Oh wow, that's awesome. Okay, well, yeah, then, um, just real quick with you, so like I know that we had talked about this a while ago and you had kind of said like I don't know, something along the lines of you said, you know, if marijuana is like a really good tool for you right now and it helps you when before you go see your dad or insert, you know, other activity, you said that would be a good thing and that's wholesome and that's okay. So I wanted to tell you is like I totally like ran like straight into that direction. And so I just started having weed more and more and more and more. And so what it's kind of come to now is like, I'll be honest, I have it sometimes before I make, um, like midway through my work day, and it's enjoyable. It's enjoyable. It totally loosens things up for me.

**Speaker B:** And then I— well, guess what? A lot of things are enjoyable, and in fact, so many things are so enjoyable that the rednecks make a lot of rules because they don't want you to have fun. They don't want you to enjoy your life. They want you to be miserable so you'll come to their church. Religions invent all kinds of rules to make people feel bad. I mean, look how many sexuality rules that have crept into our culture. Dressing codes and 10,000 other things, and who uses what toilet and all of that kind of stuff, which got very little to do with sex. But the point that I'm making here is, is that with the marijuana, enjoy it for what it is, but stay mindful of it. And in fact, um, Oh, a few months ago Marcus asked the question in the sense of him thinking that he wanted to quit smoking. And my answer to him was start watching. Make the practice of your ganja use, make it really conscious. What do I mean by that? Okay, let us say that you're just sitting, whatever, and all I have— and all you have now is the thought of a joint. You have a mental image. The mental image can be of the joint or of the ganja in a package or something like that. And so when you think about it, now you can, instead of just jumping on it or being driven there, You can say, oh, well, can I wait a minute? And maybe a minute from now I won't even think about it. Okay, so let that fleeting thought go by and say, I can wait, I'm okay right now, let me wait to smoke until I feel bad. And then we continue to feel good. So Now you come to the point if you're actually going to light it up, okay, look at all the work that it takes to actually do the joint— cutting the weed, maybe getting it out of the freezer, chopping it up, doing all the kinds of stuff that we do. Do that.

**Speaker A:** I just hold the button down for 5 seconds.

**Speaker B:** Well, you have to understand that I'm using examples that are 75 years old.

**Speaker A:** I know, I just had to let you know the convenience factor is absolutely in my favor.

**Speaker B:** All right, whatever how easy it is to use, still take that time of being mindful about what you're doing, even to the point of mindfully lighting it up, or in your case, mindfully putting the thing in your mouth and mindfully clicking the button. And then be mindful of, or watch closely, what effects that it has. Will one hit do? Do you need two? Do you need the whole stick? Whatever it is, start being aware of what you're doing. Rather than having thoughts about, oh, you're breaking the law, or you're a bad guy, or 'Oh, this, that, and the other thing.' Instead, actually enjoy what you're doing. Keep your mind on it. I do.

**Speaker A:** I— yeah, no, and I will. That's a great practice. Um, I do notice— maybe these are things that you would think, you know, that you would kind of, uh, figure are things that you'd notice if you started watching. One of them is that sometimes I'll be like sitting at work and, you know, okay, so this is a very good example. I smoke right before I do the cold calls, right before I do my sales calls. Okay, now I got to be honest with you, Dhammarato, this is absolutely insane. Absolutely insane. Okay, but this is so incredible. So I had 13 conversations today, or sorry, 13 conversations over the entire week. And out of those 13 conversations, 4 of them booked a meeting with me. So most of my coworkers are having like double that in conversations already for this week. So they're doing like 600 dials and I'm at like 300. So in half the amount of work that they're doing, I'm doing just as good, if not performing above them. And where I think this is coming from is seriously from The marijuana, it makes— I, I just get so affected, it's insane. I get so affected.

**Speaker B:** Well, okay, but we can't blame it on marijuana alone, okay? Yeah, for one thing, the people that you're talking to don't know that you're stoned, and they probably wouldn't like it if they thought that that you were stoned, right? Okay, so that's the first thing. But I— they can't tell, right? That's the whole point, you see. But, uh, when someone is drinking alcohol, you can tell. You can't— you can really, really tell the difference. That's one of the reasons why cops don't like it, uh, with the ganja, is because they can't bust you on a DUI because there's no symptoms. There's no Well, there could be a smell, but most people are smart enough to roll down their windows when they see the blue lights. And so the point then is that it's not the marijuana in and of and by itself, because you could in fact get stoned, call them, be worried that they think that you're stoned, get really paranoid about it, and blow the call.

**Speaker A:** That's true, that's true. Yeah, interesting. So then I guess the question is then, why does the other— why does the other happen?

**Speaker B:** Why is it so successful? That's because you're ready for it. You're ready for the call. Then in fact, you could probably be just as successful without the marijuana because of the kind of things that you and I have talked about before, of being friendly and all of that. And so it's the call that you're doing and what you're talking about that's so successful. And the Ganja may be sort of like the teaspoon of sugar that helps the medicine go down, but really it's the fact that you've taken the medicine about how to do the call. That very, very few people ever learn how to do that. And so you can congratulate yourself that you've actually learned. I mean, you're comparing yourself to the other people that work, even though they're professional cold callers, they haven't mastered it yet. Wait, and so in this regard, it's got nothing really to do with the marijuana. Other than you feel relaxed enough that you can take the marijuana. And it's that state of mind of being relaxed that in fact, that's the one thing that we do have culturally that everybody identifies with. That in the bar, when people get alcohol, they get rowdy, they get loud, and often they get violent. When people are sitting around getting stoned, they're sitting on the couch, they're having fun, they're laughing sometimes, they're enjoying themselves, and they're very, very unlikely to start fighting with each other. It's a different culture even.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so this is interesting because I, I gotta say that.

**Speaker B:** Um, You're right.

**Speaker A:** It does make me very relaxed. There's kind of like a relaxing out of any kind of like agenda, I guess you could say. Like, I have to get them to book this meeting. It's very relaxed, and I think it's.

**Speaker B:** Easy to take the pressure off yourself. Exactly. Then in fact, alcohol actually pressurizes us even more. To where ganja begins to take that pressure off.

**Speaker A:** So I guess it just— the reason I'm talking about this with you is because I don't want to grow like dependent, right? Dependent on marijuana in order to be happy.

**Speaker B:** This is exactly what I was talking about from before, is watch closely when you're smoking. Ask yourself the question, can I, can I make this next call without getting stoned? And start to experiment, start to play.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, okay.

**Speaker B:** Start to postpone it, or, um, go ahead and have it and notice the effect. Then in fact, uh, when you do call I would suggest that when you are smoking and then calling, give it 5 minutes. Go get stoned or do the job of the smoking and then wait until you're actually stoned and you can feel the sensations of the marijuana. And then that's when you make the call. As opposed to waking up, starting the call after you've just smoked and then letting the stone sneak up on you while you're in the call. You see what I mean?

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, yeah, no, it hits me pretty fast, like within probably a minute to 2 minutes. So then I make my calls right after that.

**Speaker B:** But you guys have got better stuff than we had back way—.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, no, it is pretty great. It vaporizes, um, and it's a lot healthier too to smoke. So, um, but no, this is, this is good to know. I, I just Yeah, you know, I just don't— the other thing that I noticed, Dhammarato, is that when I am stoned or when I'm high, there's no— there's not— it's not even as important to be wholesome, and it's not even— it's not even as important to practice anything. I'm just— I'm just chilling. I'm just there.

**Speaker B:** Well, let us say it like this then, is that You're actually taking the importance out of it, and that the original practice was for chilling anyway, that that's in fact chilling out. In our language is a good working definition for the Buddha's word Nibbana, is chill out.

**Speaker A:** So do you think the high from weed then is really kind of like a pointing. It's kind of like pointing us like that, that high. It's kind of like showing you that, hey, this is kind of more how you truly are when you're not bound up by societal standards and ways of yourself.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes. Allow yourself to get into that easygoing state. Because marijuana doesn't get you, um, drunk, but it does have a lot of physiological things to it. One of the things that they have noticed is that it actually lowers blood pressure because we're more relaxed.

**Speaker A:** The other thing that's really interesting about it though too is it can also increase your anxiety and your paranoia as well.

**Speaker B:** If you're already full of anxiety and paranoia, it'll really trigger it because of all of the fear. Because whatever fear there's there, now we have the fear of getting caught smoking. Okay. And so any kind of drug like that will generally increase the way we feel because it takes the inhibitions out. And so if you're going in the direction of relaxation and you get stoned, then you're going to go deeper into the state of relaxation. If in fact you're really, really uptight, you're unsure, you're in a dangerous situation— let us, let us say that the place that would be really dangerous to smoke would be in a crowded bathroom at a sports event. But more than likely, one of the dudes in that toilet is going to be a cop. Okay. And so going into the public toilet to smoke is a dangerous thing to do. And we wind up getting really uptight and tense and whatever like that. And we blame that on the marijuana, where in fact, no, it was the circumstances that we were in that caused forced us to get uptight. The same thing is true— let me finish this point— the same thing is true about psychedelics, mushrooms, ayahuascas, etc., like that, is that if you have a guide who knows what he's doing and do it in a ceremony, then the people that are doing these drugs will feel more comfortable and they'll get a better sensation out of it. Situation out of it, as compared to you go out on the street and you buy LSD or some psychedelic, you don't know what it is, you're worried about it, you take it home, if you think it's dangerous, you're going to go nuts, and then you take the drug, and now the bad feelings that you're in is really going to mess you up. Okay, so the circumstances that create how we feel then is going to be multiplied or amplified by the, uh, by the drug that we're in. So if you've already got the idea that, oh, I'm going to relax and have a telephone call with this customer and everything's going to be all right, then smoking in that frame of mind and things are going to be exactly just like that. But if you smoke with the idea Right, exactly. Okay, but the other possibility is, oh, my boss is going to catch me smoking while I'm talking to the customer, I'm going to get fired.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I just don't even go there. I just don't even go there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, exactly. So in that regard, you can see that it's got nothing— in this regard, it's not that the marijuana is going to make you paranoid, it's that the paranoid state that we get in over marijuana is going to be worse.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker B:** Okay, right, right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so this is part of what I'm talking about, is be careful about lighting up. Be careful about when you're doing it, how you feel, etc., like that. Become completely aware of what you're doing. Give yourself permission to do it and to feel good, knowing that it helps you become successful.

**Speaker A:** Okay, yeah, that's— and that's what I've been doing. Um, I think just sometimes— so you're.

**Speaker B:** Getting that reconfirmation from me that that's, that's the correct way to do it. So now you've got 3 things. One, is that what you wanted? Number 2, the cold calls are proving that you're doing it correctly. And now you've got me coming in and reamplifying that to say, yeah, it's okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. And, um, I'm just— I'm, I'm like nervous because, um, to be honest with you, like, I use it for not everything but for pretty much everything.

**Speaker B:** Like, but notice the nervous. Notice the nervous that you're talking about, that you're using it for everything. Oh no, poor me, if I use too much ganja, I'll be nervous. And you're already nervous. I don't know, man, you're just spinning.

**Speaker A:** Me out of my argument. I don't know what I'm supposed to say now.

**Speaker B:** Watch, here's what— watch closely now. Watch what's going on. That's— in other words, this is, this is Dhamma. Remember, when you're lighting up, to watch and pay close attention to how you feel and what you're doing and what thoughts you're having, etc., like that. Notice the effects. Notice whether you like the effects or not. Notice the results of your calls, which you've been doing. Okay, so I'm giving you a of the kind of permission to experiment.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and I wanted to say, it's not just the calls either. It's like dates, going out on dates, being with family, even being at the gym. It's crazy, just the degree of success that is found through all that.

**Speaker B:** So Well, here's the thing, is that back in the 1930s, "Reaper Madness" and all of that kind of stuff, there was some heavy-duty racial components in there. That in fact, one of the ways that they would think is that if the Chinese coolies are using opium, and the Mexicans and the Blacks are using marijuana, we can't get them to work; we can only get the rednecks to work. We can't control them, okay? And so, well, let's make that stuff illegal so that we can control our workforce. That's where it got started, okay? And it continues that way. In fact, now that marijuana is becoming legalized in the United States, the pharmaceuticals and the alcohol industry We don't like it very much at all. Where ganja is legal, alcohol consumption goes down.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's good. That's very good.

**Speaker B:** And where marijuana is legal, heavy-duty narcotics, heroin and other things like that, go down. But you see, they've been talked to and told everybody for forever that marijuana is a gateway drug. Yeah, it is. But it's a gateway drug to relaxation. Yeah. And they don't want you to be relaxed. They want you uptight and ready to work.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's just amazing. I, I don't know. I've created an incredible situation for myself here, Dhammarato, because I can work literally 5 to 6 hours in the day and get all my work done. I'm not even working a full 8-hour workday.

**Speaker B:** And you're beginning to enjoy your life.

**Speaker A:** And I'm beginning to enjoy my life a lot more. The only thing though that is kind of scary about it is it's enjoyed through the filter of being high. It's not okay.

**Speaker B:** So this is part of what I was talking about, is to know that, experiment with it, rather than being afraid that you're going to be dependent upon it. Because in fact, they've done lots of research and that there is no psychosomatic— um, that's what I have heard, right? Yeah, there is no— there is no addiction. The only real addiction is that we like it and continue to do it because we're getting benefit out of it. Yeah, but stoners don't— yeah, stoners don't become skid row bums. Alcoholics become skid row bums.

**Speaker A:** I guess, Dhammarato, you know what it is? It's like If I smoke weed and I get high and I go see a girl, I'm going to be really confident. Like, it's going to be easier to talk to them, make them laugh, be myself, all that, right? But my fear is that if I keep doing this over and over and over, I'll get married to my ability while I'm high. I'll be married to that, kind of. And so I won't want to— here's something about that.

**Speaker B:** Or have all those— not high, you're looking at the wrong thing. You're working— okay, okay, all right, okay. Here's the way that you want to look at that, and that is that the girl that you're going to date and marry, you don't want her to have conflicts. So let us say that she was raised Catholic and she hates everything, then she won't want you to smoke. She'll try to get you to quit smoking, and that's going to cause a lot of controversy within the relationship. So one of the things, if you begin to date and begin to get serious with a girl, you got to.

**Speaker A:** Tell her.

**Speaker B:** That you're a toker. Oh, for sure. No, yeah, absolutely right. And then it's okay. But if you try to hide it, that's going to cause a lot of conflict. In fact, you don't even want to be around the girl that you've got to hide from.

**Speaker A:** Sure, right. That's a good point.

**Speaker B:** Um, but, but it's still not the marijuana. That, in fact, I can give you stories about people that I've known that have been stoned literally all day long, day after day, for 50 years, and they live just happily.

**Speaker A:** Wow. Wait a minute, so you're saying it's not the marijuana?

**Speaker B:** It's not the marijuana. It's the hatred and the control issues.

**Speaker A:** No, but like my confidence my success, my happiness. You're saying that's not the marijuana either?

**Speaker B:** No, it's not. It's not the marijuana. It's your attitude about it, and it's your attitude about, can you handle this, can you handle that.

**Speaker A:** Could it be said then that marijuana makes it easier for me to take the view that I can handle it? Yeah, that everything's fine, right?

**Speaker B:** If you take the attitude that getting stoned is okay, that it's fine, that I like it, that there is no side effects to it, or that you can start looking at what are the side effects. I remember for myself, one of the big exciting bit about it was, is that it was just so much work. Nowadays it's really easy. They've got much better equipment. Yeah, but I don't think any of that equipment is on this island. But in, in this island actually is, is, um, a Gajra paradise that in Thailand it's been, it's been illegal for, uh, since the 1970s because of the U.S. Government. The U.S. government went around making ganja and other things illegal all over the world. And now that the U.S. is backing off and not pushing other countries, Thailand is the first country in Southeast Asia to actually legalize it. But the way they did it was completely different than the way that they did it in the States. In the States, they made special laws and things to, you know, to jack around and all of this kind of stuff, cutting corners and whatnot. Thailand just merely repealed their laws. They just repealed them, going back to the way that it was in the 1960s. And here's something very unusual, is that the guy who moved in, he moved in in November, about the time that the laws were changed. And now we've got a marijuana garden within 75 feet of me. The guy next— yeah, in fact, I can look right out here and I can see one of the plants that is sitting in a bucket right out in the open. So the whole idea about it has changed, but it's changed in an organic kind of Thai way. In the sense that things have reverted back to the way that they were in the 1960s, as opposed in the West, they're still looking for stronger stuff. They're, you know, trying to match this plant with that plant and all kinds of business stuff. To where here in— there's actually been an industry right on this island, but all of the ganja was way up in the hills. Where it could not be easily seen, and now it's down there on the street corner in potted— in pots. So, um, uh, it being open like that is the better kind of society to live in, that we don't actually enjoy living in a society that has a lot of rules. And the The more rules there are, the worse the living is for the people. And I give you Russia as an example, or any authoritarian government. They put in a lot of rules so that they can stay in control. Okay, and so when we don't have a lot of rules and a lot of controls, everybody can kind of make up for their own mind about how they want to live their lives. Give us freedom.

**Speaker A:** The side effects that I do get are I get some phlegm in my throat and I have to clear my throat often. Doctor told me that I have like a lot of fluid collecting right here at the base of my neck and that I should get some like Sudafed and stuff, but I don't like that stuff because it's like chemicals and that stuff.

**Speaker B:** So, well, here's the way to handle that. That as soon as you find the water or the fluids collecting, throw them out. Keep your air passages clean.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I can't, I can't. Are you saying like suck it, like suck it all the way back?

**Speaker B:** Well, if it's in the throat, you want to hark it up like that.

**Speaker A:** Well, um, it's not coming out.

**Speaker B:** Well, you're not doing it. If you keep doing that and keep loosening it up, it'll come out. Okay. And whenever you're lighting up, you can say, hey, is this going to make my throat heavy with fluid?

**Speaker A:** Right, I know.

**Speaker B:** And then you can decide, well, am I going to smoke now or am I going to give my throat a rest? Always has to do with investigating what's going on. That's what I recommend. Remember to look at what you're doing, because with good information you can make wiser choices.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, for sure.

**Speaker B:** And which means then that you might want to use less marijuana. See, before we just thought that it was great stuff, and then you're, you're using it But if you really look at what you're doing, then you can recognize, well, maybe right now I'm not going to smoke.

**Speaker A:** Right?

**Speaker B:** And so you can begin to regulate it because you're doing it through wisdom.

**Speaker A:** But I can take it as an edible.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I hadn't thought about that. Those edibles didn't even exist. I don't think anybody way back when.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Oh, sorry, my, uh, my whole video froze.

**Speaker B:** I would also assume that, uh, um, oh, I don't know, my, my thought would be that edibles are kind of expensive in the sense you got to put a whole lot of grass. I mean, I could, I could take one joint, take one hit, and get the feeling, but if I pointed to an edible, I'm gonna have to eat a half a pound.

**Speaker A:** Hey, Dhammarato, can't see you.

**Speaker B:** Oh, well, I'm here.

**Speaker A:** Can you try to turn the camera on and off again?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'll turn the camera off and back on again. Did that help? There you are. All right, okay. So for all of the things that we've done today, it's always the same advice. Look at what you're doing, keep your thoughts wholesome, notice what's going on, recognizing that you're okay, everything is fine. I'm fine before I take that token. I'm fine after I do.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Cool. Watch closely now.

**Speaker A:** Watch closely now.

**Speaker B:** All right, Alex, why don't we finish this? I think we've gotten, um, enough for you today.

**Speaker A:** For sure, Dhammarato. Thank you.

**Speaker B:** I'm so glad you called. I really enjoy our time together, Alex. Good for you. Congratulations. All right, okay, okay. All right, bye-bye. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk between Dhammarato (Speaker B) and Alex (Speaker A) revolves around a central theme: **the danger of seeking "what's next" on the path, and the importance of finding satisfaction and sufficiency in the present step.**

Here is a structured summary of the key points:

### **Core Teaching: The Path is the Goal**
*   **The Problem of "What's Next?":** Alex identifies a strong practice of noticing the unwholesome and accepting it, but feels a pull to find the "next step" to build the wholesome. Dhammarato identifies this very desire for "what's next" as an unwholesome thought rooted in dissatisfaction and a sense of not being "good enough yet."
*   **The Analogy of Being Lost:** Dhammarato uses the analogy of being lost in the wilderness. Once you find a reliable stream or path (the **Eightfold Noble Path**), the only instruction is to follow it. Questioning "Are we there yet?" or "Where does it lead?" is counterproductive; the practice is to stay on the path, step by step.
*   **Tearing Up the To-Do List:** The spiritual goal is not to check off achievements (like Jhanas), but to "tear up the to-do list" altogether. The feeling that **"this step is good enough"**—that you have arrived and are safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied in this moment—is itself the entry into deeper states of peace (Jhana). The cultural habit of constant striving is the obstacle.

### **Practical Applications**
The discussion then applies this "everything is fine, stay on the path" principle to two areas of Alex's life:

1.  **Dating & Relationships:**
    *   **The "Wishing Tree" of Desire:** Alex notes that dating apps can pull him off the path with desires and expectations. Dhammarato calls this the "wishing tree" of the mind—stepping off the path to fantasize.
    *   **The Practice:** The advice is to **enjoy the moment without expectation**. Let connection happen naturally, without pressure or a chase mentality. Be present, listen carefully, and let the other person take the lead sometimes. This keeps the interaction on the "path" of wholesome, present-moment engagement.

2.  **Marijuana Use:**
    *   **Mindful Experimentation:** Alex reports using marijuana frequently and finding it boosts relaxation, confidence, and success in work and social life. His concern is dependency.
    *   **The Core Teaching Applied:** Dhammarato advises not to attribute success or happiness *to the substance*, but to the **state of mind it facilitates**—relaxation, lack of agenda, and the attitude that "everything is fine."
    *   **The Practice:**
        *   **Use with Mindfulness:** Be fully conscious when using it. Pause before acting on the urge. Observe its effects meticulously.
        *   **Investigate Dependency:** Experiment with making calls or going on dates without it. See if the beneficial state of mind can be accessed independently.
        *   **Watch for Side Effects:** Pay close attention to physical effects (e.g., phlegm) and let that awareness guide wiser, more regulated use.
        *   **The Key Insight:** The goal is to cultivate the **easygoing, satisfied, and confident state** itself. Marijuana may point to that state, but the practice is to learn to generate it through the Dhamma, not through a substance.

### **Conclusion & Recurring Motif**
Dhammarato concludes by tying everything back to the fundamental instruction:
*   **"Look at what you're doing, keep your thoughts wholesome, notice what's going on, recognizing that you're okay, everything is fine."**
*   The entire talk is a masterclass in applying the Dhamma not as a future-oriented self-improvement project, but as a framework for finding **immediate satisfaction and sufficiency in the present moment**, thereby walking the path correctly right now. The "next step" is always the same: sustain the wholesome thought that **"this is good enough."**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several key metaphors and stories to illustrate the spiritual path and common pitfalls. Here are the main ones:

### 1. **The Lost in the Wilderness / Following the Stream or Path**
This is the central, extended metaphor used to describe finding and staying on the Dharma path.
*   **The Situation:** You are lost in the wilderness (representing confusion, suffering, being lost in life/samsara).
*   **The Solution:** You find a stream or a man-made path. You know that following a stream downhill or a path will eventually lead you to civilization (representing safety, clarity, or Nibbana).
*   **The Teaching:** Once you've found the stream/path (the Eightfold Noble Path), your only job is to follow it. Don't get off it by asking "Are we there yet?" or "Where does it go?" Just stay on the path. The path itself is the practice—"one step at a time, one breath at a time."

### 2. **Waiting at the Train Station**
This story reinforces the "stay on the path" metaphor.
*   **The Situation:** You are weary and arrive at a small-town train station. The station agent says they don't know when the train will come, but it will come.
*   **The Teaching:** The wise action is to wait at the station (stay on the path). The mistake is to leave the station to look for the train yourself, which puts you back into a state of being lost and searching blindly.

### 3. **Tearing Up the To-Do List**
This metaphor addresses the mindset of striving and "what's next?"
*   **The Image:** We often approach practice like a to-do list, wanting to tick off achievements (Jhanas, insights, etc.).
*   **The Teaching:** The real goal is not to complete items but to **tear up the to-do list** itself. This represents realizing that you have already "arrived" in the sense that this present moment, on the path, is sufficient. The job is to cultivate satisfaction *now*, not to reach for a future achievement.

### 4. **The Wishing Tree**
This metaphor describes distractions and cravings that pull you off the path.
*   **The Image:** While walking the path, you see a "wishing tree" off to the side—a tree where you could stop and make wishes ("I wish I had this, I wished I was that").
*   **The Teaching:** Going to the wishing tree means leaving the path. It represents getting caught in desires, fantasies, and cravings (explicitly linked later to things like obsessing over dating apps). It keeps you from the simple, sufficient step of "this is good enough."

### 5. **Looking for Your Glasses / The "Finally" Story**
A short, logical story to challenge the mindset of striving for an endpoint.
*   **The Story:** You say, "I was looking for my glasses and I *finally* found them in the last place I looked."
*   **The Teaching:** Of course you found them in the last place you looked—you stop looking once you find them! This humorously points out that the search (the practice) naturally continues until its purpose is fulfilled. The "finally" mindset creates an imaginary endpoint and dissatisfaction with the present search.

### 6. **Sadie Hawkins Dance**
Used in the practical discussion about dating, this isn't a metaphor he creates but a **cultural reference** he uses to illustrate a principle.
*   **The Reference:** The Sadie Hawkins dance, where girls ask boys.
*   **The Teaching:** Applied to dating, it suggests inverting the usual dynamic of pursuit. Instead of "chasing" (which comes from wanting, from the "wishing tree"), let the connection happen naturally. "Let them take the lead... enjoy the moment without expectations." This applies the "no wanting, stay on the path" principle to a social context.

### 7. **Marijuana as a Tool (Implied Metaphor: The Teaspoon of Sugar)**
While not a formal story, his discussion frames marijuana in a specific way.
*   **The Teaching:** He suggests marijuana is not the *source* of success or relaxation but can be like **"the teaspoon of sugar that helps the medicine go down."** The "medicine" is the Dhamma—the attitude of relaxation, lack of agenda, and "everything is fine." The drug might make it easier to access that state, but the state itself is what's important. The core practice is to **"watch closely"** and be mindful of its effects, using wisdom to decide when and how to use it.

### **Unifying Theme:**
All these metaphors and stories combat the "what's next?" mentality. They emphasize that the path is found in **the present moment of practice** (following the stream, waiting at the station, taking this step), that **dissatisfaction comes from wanting more** (the wishing tree, the to-do list), and that **freedom is found in realizing "this is good enough."**
