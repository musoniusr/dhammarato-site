### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, hello everyone, welcome to the weekly UK Sangha. I host these talks every week on Wednesday. I'm flying to Thailand for a month, so the time will probably change that I do them. So I'm gonna have to figure out when I'm gonna change that too, but I'm here with my friends Anicca and Pietro, and we have a sutta picked out for today. It's a fairly short sutta, but it caught my interest and has some good supramundane Dhamma. That we can dive into and explore, as opposed to mundane Dharma. Supramundane Dharma would just mean the Dharma that leads to the end of suffering rather than the Dharma that postpones the end of suffering. That's mundane Dharma. So, oh, maybe next life I'll get a better rebirth or something. That's what most people believe the Buddha teaches. And that's available for people who don't practice the supramundane Dharma. So there's nothing— I had nothing against it. But I've really only been interested in the supramundane teaching of the Buddha. So that's normally what I talk about on my calls. But if it's too high out there, if it doesn't resonate, that's not a problem at all. There's a lot of other Dhamma teachers out there. Okay, so this is from the Samyutta Nikaya 12.15. And I'm not going to try to pronounce the Pali title. Because I don't know how to pronounce Kaccayana Gotasutta. But here it goes. Dwelling at Savatthi. Oh, and this is the Tanhisro Bhikkhu translation. Dwelling at Savatthi, then Venerable Kaccayana Gota approached the Blessed One. And on arrival, having bowed down, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One, Lord, right view, right view. It is said, to what extent is there right view? Okay, so right view, it's the first, uh, it's the first item of the Eightfold Noble Path. Um, the practice starts with right view. The path starts, the entire path starts with right view. So right view is pretty important. Right view comes first. That's a— I forgot what sutta that's from, but it's a direct quote from one of the middle-length discourses. Right view comes first. So the sutta is going to talk about Right View. By and large, Kaccayana, this world is supported by a polarity, that of existence and non-existence. But when one sees the origination of the world as it actually is with right discernment, non-existence with reference to the world does not occur to one. When one sees the cessation of the world as it actually is with right discernment, existence with reference to the world does not occur to one. Okay, so essentially what this is trying to point to is that The practice of Right View is to not hold any ontological beliefs about what reality really is, other than the direct experience of it. So when the world is there, you recognize that the world is there. And when the world goes away, So that would be the meditative experience of cessation. Or you can say every night in deep sleep, deep sleep, the world goes away. Then you don't say that the world is there. So when one sees the cessation of the world as it actually is with right discernment, existence with reference to the world does not occur to one. So you don't, in other words, you don't fabricate what isn't there. If things pass away, you don't claim that they're existing. If things are existing, you don't claim that they're non-existing either. So a lot of people do this in Buddhism. They'll look at manifested existence and say, oh, it's all emptiness actually. It's all non-existent. That's not true because it's there. It is. It's existent. So right view is a common sense approach of just looking directly at our experience of reality and seeing it for what it is. So the Buddha does not teach that there is existence or non-existence. That's misunderstanding, or that everything is empty or made of emptiness. That's a misunderstanding of emptiness. So existence and non-existence, another— I don't know if this is a translation of rupa and arupa raga, but another way you could word it is emptiness and form. Okay, this is a very common theme, and not just Buddhism, but so nothingness and somethingness, right? The two kind of like, they're two, they're kind of two dependent concepts, just like up and down. Up is dependent on down, and down is dependent on up. But when one sees the origination of the world as it actually is with right discernment, non-existence with reference to the world does not occur to one. Right? So you see things with basic mindfulness or basic viewing. So you just take in your experience as it comes. Without any conceptual overlay about what it is. Okay, it is what it is. By and large, Kacchayana, this world is in bondage to attachments, clingings, and biases. But one such as this does not get involved with or cling to these attachments. Clingings and fixations of awareness, biases, or obsessions. Nor is he resolved on myself. He has no uncertainty or doubt that just stress, when arising, is arising. So stress is Dukkha. Stress, when passing away, is passing away. In this, his knowledge is independent of others. It's to this extent, Kacchayana, that there is right view. Right. Okay, so there's going to be a parallel here drawn. So the same way when there is existence, you recognize there is existence, and when there is non-existence, you recognize there is non-existence. The same goes for Dukkha, and really the only purpose of existence and non-existence, the only reason why it's important is because its relationship to Dukkha. So all manifested form is Dukkha, but it's going to get into that. And then the passing away of Dukkha is the passing away of manifested form. But yeah, the whole world is concerned about stuff that does not matter to the one who's practicing the supramundane Dharma. It's full of biases. So like, people are attached to their viewpoints, their view of the world, the way that they think the world is, or the way that they think it should be. All kinds of prejudices. Based upon their conditionings, maybe their upbringing, maybe some experiences they had. They form all kinds of worldviews. But this is not Right View. So these attachments and these biases are actually what limit you from seeing what is actually true. So if we have already a prejudice or a bias that something will be a certain way, we're going to see it more skewed in that direction. Our vision will be obstructed or filtered out by the mental process of that bias. I mean, you can see this in science. You know, there's a well-known concept called confirmation bias. If you're only looking for one type of evidence, that's all the evidence that you're going to find. So the bias confirms itself. So if you think the world is a lousy place, and it's— and life sucks, well, the world will be a lousy place and life will suck. So that would be a bias, right? If you have the predisposition to feeling a certain way and thinking a certain way, you're going to experience more of that stuff that confirms your own mental bias. So, oh, I'm unlovable, or oh, everybody always leaves me, or like some kind of bias like that. It's gonna be a self-fulfilling prophecy. So the idea is to not attach yourself to any of these biases or worldviews, and just simply see things directly for what it is. And don't guess what it's going to be, just experience it as it happens. So in this way, you're not obsessed with yourself. You're just experiencing reality. You don't have a concept or a bias about me. Myself is ultimately the strongest bias that we have. So we experience reality through the lens of myself. And we end up missing a lot of things and attaching to things and misidentifying things and misinterpreting all kinds of situations. Because we filtered out so much information through the lens that this is me. So he has no uncertainty or doubt that just stress or Dukkha, when arising, is arising. Yeah, so you just recognize Dukkha. Okay, this is Dukkha. Even subtle Dukkha, it's still Dukkha. You just recognize it when it's arising, it's arising, and when passing away is passing away. And that's all you kind of— that's all Right View is really concerned with. Okay, I'm going to move on unless there's anything anyone wants to talk about. Oh, welcome, Anna. Good to have you. Okay, I'm going to move on to the next paragraph. Everything exists, that is one extreme. Everything doesn't exist, that is a second extreme. Avoiding these two extremes, the Tathagata teaches the Dhamma via the middle. From ignorance as a requisite condition comes fabrications. From fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness. From consciousness as a requisite condition comes name and form. From name and form as a requisite condition comes the six sense media. So sight, sound, taste, touch, mind objects. From the six sense media as requisite conditions comes contact. So when the mind comes into contact with the media or the content of our senses, that contact is the mental processing of that information. And from contact as a requisite condition comes feeling. So through the processing of the six sense media, a feeling will arise. Either pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral. From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving. Right? So if we like it, we want it. If we don't like it, we want it to go away. From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging. From clinging as a requisite condition comes becoming. From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth. From birth as a requisite condition, then aging and death. Sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair come into play. Such is the origination of the entire mass of suffering. All right, so That was— I'm sure you guys heard that before, but that was essentially the whole dependent origination that the Buddha teaches, Paticcasamuppada. And it's important, it's important what was prefaced before this teaching, Paticcasamuppada, was elaborated. So everything exists is one extreme, everything doesn't exist is another extreme. So the Buddha doesn't teach like what the beginning of reality was or what reality is going towards, or like he doesn't teach everything exists or everything doesn't exist. The only thing he teaches is the current Arisal How in this very moment, here and now, how does suffering arise? And this is the sequence of events that happens that leads to the problem of life, the problem of old age, disease, and death, the only problem that we really have at the end of the day. Is suffering and despair and death. So these are interesting topics to us because we'd like to know what the escape from it is, right? We'd like to know how can we find deliverance from this problem? How can we find salvation? Right? So we're not really concerned about what— oh, is reality— is the true nature of reality made of consciousness? Or like, is it made of Newtonian Lego blocks? Or is it made of atomic energies and wavelengths? That's not really the problem here. So, I mean, you can think about that kind of stuff, but it's not going to lead to the end of suffering. All right, so now from the remainderless fading and cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications. So this is like the, this is the reverse dependent origination. So this is how suffering comes to an end. So from the cessation of that ignorance, and what's the cessation of ignorance? Simply right view. So simply the practice of viewing things as they are and not imagining what they aren't. Okay, that's the cessation of ignorance. So now from the remainderless fading and cessation of that very ignorance, comes the cessation of fabrications. From the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness. From the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of name and form. From the cessation of name and form comes the cessation of the six sense media. From the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact. From the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling. From the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving. From the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging and sustenance. From the cessation of clinging and sustenance comes the cessation of becoming. From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth. From the cessation of birth, then aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair all cease. Such is the cessation of the entire mass of suffering. All right, well, that's the end of the sutta. Is there any thing anyone would like to talk about. Thank you. My pleasure.

**Speaker B:** I just got a— yeah, go on.

**Speaker A:** Go ahead, Nisha.

**Speaker B:** I just wanted to— by the logic in that sutta, it would seemingly pose that we kind of came into this world through suffering. Would that be an accurate kind of something to deduce from all that?

**Speaker A:** So suffering is the result, it's not the cause. So suffering would be at the end of dependent origination. All of this stuff happens that leads to suffering. When you're first born, it's not really a problem. You're like, yeah, I'm alive.

**Speaker B:** Okay, but are we not born because of suffering?

**Speaker A:** No. And.

**Speaker B:** Why are we born?

**Speaker A:** Birth also doesn't necessarily mean literally when you came out of your mother's womb. Okay, so birth is used in a much— so the Buddha, the way the Buddha teaches birth is used in a much more experiential way than the concept of your birth. Because do you even remember being born? I don't. Right. So at a certain point, you become aware. So like you become self-conscious. It's more talking about the birth of the sense of self. That's kind of what birth means in this context. So the birth of the sense of self, right? A baby doesn't really have very much of a sense of self, like a newly born baby. All it's doing is taking in raw data. So, so, so, um, kind of going.

**Speaker B:** Before that though, you know, what's that? Because there was a, there was an action that led to birth, and what was that action rooted in?

**Speaker A:** You know, like the whole— it was like your parents, your parents, uh, they liked each other very much and they had sex and they— and one of them impregnated the other.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but is that action like— can that action actually be rooted in craving? I suppose that's kind of my question, you know. Can there really be selfless kind of enlightened lovemaking, or is there a rooted kind of craving in that aspect? Because I can only imagine— good question— that's great— my father and stuff, you know. Oh yeah, I mean, like, it kind of sounds like the whole problem of life is suffering, so therefore we're kind of born into this world through suffering, even though it might be veiled in pleasure or whatever, right?

**Speaker A:** Um, yeah, that's a good point. Um, a lot of people are in that school, so a lot of Dharma teaching would say that, like, all sex happens— like, sex by definition is you can only have sex from craving, and that you cannot have like enlightened sex or whatever. But, uh, I don't know, I don't really have that point of view. I think sex is just— once you.

**Speaker B:** Reach the state of Anagami, don't you?

**Speaker A:** But supposedly some people teach that. So I don't claim to be Anagami or reach the state of Anagami, so there's nothing really I could tell you about that. Some people claim that that's the case. Whether I believe them or not is a different story, but that's just for you to decide for yourself. But sex is— it's a natural instinct. Just like eating, obviously. I mean, technically, every time you eat, there has to be craving to eat, right? Like, you're hungry to survive, right? So obviously, if you don't have sex for the rest of your life, you wouldn't die. But I would put it in that there is an instinctual mechanism that operates, and I don't think there's necessarily anything wrong with it, or it's not I wouldn't say that like having sex is not spiritual or anything like that. Like, I would think that's— that would be kind of ridiculous, and like that would just be a preacher thing to do, or like a priest thing to do. But, um, for those who choose not to, um, that's totally fine too. It just depends on, uh, your specific circumstance.

**Speaker B:** Um, yeah, well, I'm just curious you know, about this whole dimension that we arrive into and from what is the precursor state that brought us here, you know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so that— so it's a common.

**Speaker B:** Thing to think about.

**Speaker A:** So like, but that will go on forever, you know. You can always think about, uh, what caused this, and then, well, well then what caused that? And then, well, then what caused that? And what caused that, right? You can keep going. It's like almost an infinite regression. So that's why the Buddha's emphasizing, instead of thinking about what was the beginning of it all, because ultimately you can't know that. And then also, it's not even what's causing suffering right now. Really, what the teaching is, is there is a sequence of events, happening this very moment that's creating your suffering, that's creating, that's creating, uh, all of, all the whole mass of suffering is happening each moment like that. You're, uh, welcome Jesus, or Jesus, um, good to see you. So, so you're being reborn every moment. Every moment, uh, a thought arises, it has established existence., it passes away, and it dies. And then another thought arises. You experience that thought, it passes away, and it dies. So the idea is to look directly at our experience and see that it's constantly coming in and out of existence, or every it may not be clear that your entire experience is coming in and out of existence. But if you look at each individual aspect of it, it is coming in and out of existence. Right? So if you just take thoughts, for example, okay, you can see that the thoughts are arising and passing away. And then if you take vision, for example, you can see that the sights that you have is changing. If I close my eyes, the vision of the room passes away. If I open my eyes, the vision of the room arises. So, and it's the same for sound. You hear a sound, it arises. You hear it, and it vanishes. So, and this is true for literally everything, every single aspect of our experience. So if we have Right View, we can see that all of manifestation, even all of Dukkha, is arising and passing away. And realizing this so totally can lead to a sort of big release of attachment. And a big release of delusion. So it can happen at larger and smaller scales. So a lot of people will say like, what is cessation, right? Is it blanking out of existence, right? Well, you can experience the cessation of perception and feeling. That would be kind of like A classic experience of Nibbana. But then also you can experience the cessation of each thought you're having, or the cessation of each feeling you're having. Your feelings are changing all the time. Or how about the cessation of each breath? A breath arises out of nothing, you experience it, and then it passes away. That's cessation right there. Right? So you're being born, and as a result of birth, death happens. It's the same way. It's another way of saying that something arising is the condition for it passing away. So the.

**Speaker B:** Very— So by that logic, we would actually do come into this world from suffering. Otherwise we wouldn't have.

**Speaker A:** Arisen, surely. Well, suffering arises and then suffering passes away. Okay.

**Speaker B:** And life, the whole problem of life is that we die, and that is the.

**Speaker A:** Dukkha. The Dukkha is the ignorance that this suffering is me or mine, rather than just arising and passing away naturally on its own. So the Dukkha, ultimately, if you want to pin something down to the source of all suffering, the first step of how suffering is created is ignorance. And ignorance is simply not paying attention. Are not seeing clearly what's really going on right now in this moment. So the Buddha is— so like Nisha, I also had a very existential mind as well that's very interested and curious. Where did this all come from? You know, how is there something rather than nothing? Those kind of bigger questions, I'm very interested in that kind of stuff too. But what the Buddha is doing, saying in the sutta explicitly, is he's not teaching any of that. He's not teaching any kind of hypothetical existential paradigms for how reality is creating, or all of his— everything exists, or that nothing exists. He's not trying to establish an ontological view of reality. All he's establishing is the right view that realizes in this very moment what is reality now. And that leads to the end of suffering. You see that reality right now is always changing, and it's not— there's no continuous self to be found in any of it. Therefore, uh, it can't be satisfying to me. And then so you can let go. You can let go and just watch. And when you let go and just watch, uh, you'll see that things do pass away and things do vanish. And when you really see that things do really vanish on the most profound scale, then that would be the total end of Dukkha. And then that experience will speak for itself. There's no more questions at that point, because you realize that all your questions were really just about suffering. Ultimately, the only motive behind anything that we do is because we believe that it will end our suffering. The only reason why someone would want to have sex, right? The only reason why someone wants to do stuff in the world, why they want to procreate, why they want to do anything, why they want to philosophize, why they want to think about stuff, is because they believe that it'll lead to the end of their suffering. That's the motivating— suffering is a motivating.

**Speaker B:** Um— well, that would deduce that we are born out of suffering. If you say that, if all our actions are based on craving and we're.

**Speaker A:** Trying to pursue the pain, like 'we are born out of suffering' is already from the vantage point of ignorance. Because 'we are born out of suffering'— who is born out of suffering, right? Me. So there's a self. And instead of 'reality is taking place,' and instead of, okay, the sixth sense media is arising, And as that is a requisite, contact is happening, my senses are being processed, that as a requisite, feeling is arising. You don't see that all of this process is happening impersonally, and you think that there is a me that is being born, or is a me that—.

**Speaker B:** You could just say the dependent origination that I experience is born out of suffering, or I guess not I, or, you know, the thing, the different components that are, you know, turning and spinning are born out of some sort of, you know.

**Speaker A:** Craving. Craving is a little further on down the line, so it's not the first step. Right. The order is pretty important.

**Speaker B:** So I'm just— because in the sutta it talked about the dependent origination, and.

**Speaker A:** To me that seems like— I'm just.

**Speaker B:** Going to briefly— yeah, of what's going on here.

**Speaker A:** So ignorance as a requisite. Comes consciousness, from consciousness name and form, from name and form the six sense media, from the six sense media contact, feeling, then craving, clinging. So the direct requisite for birth, so the one that comes right before birth is clinging and becoming. So if you want to think about it, and so why was— why is birth happening? From the teaching of dependent origination, it's because there's some kind of clinging. You want to be born, okay?

**Speaker B:** So you want— and you see what I'm saying is true, what I My first question, we came into this life from a starting point of suffering. We came, we're here because of suffering. If birth is at the end.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I mean, the first thing you do when you're born is cry.

**Speaker B:** Exactly, exactly. That's my whole point. That's what I've been thinking for a long time. I'm just trying to speak to you guys about it. It's like, all right, maybe it is true. Maybe it's not, I don't know. But it seems to make a lot of sense. Once we kind of have all these bits of Buddha's teaching put.

**Speaker A:** Together. Yeah, so the pretty much everything that we experience is Dukkha, is suffering. But the end of Dukkha isn't really an experience rather than the vanishing of previous Dukkha. So that's an important insight. So yeah, everything we experience from the moment we're born is Dukkha. But the way the experience operates, if we develop the skill of Right View. Experience is not permanent, and there's no self in it. It's always disappearing. And the experience of it disappearing is what is felt as the relief of that Dukkha. So if you have a headache, and then the headache's gone, It feels good that the headache is gone. All right, so the relief of, like, the experience of relief or the end of suffering is by the vanishing of the suffering that has arisen.

**Speaker B:** Well, it's craving, I guess, isn't.

**Speaker A:** It?

**Speaker B:** The relinquishment of.

**Speaker A:** Craving. Yeah, it's definitely— that's definitely a root part of it. And the cool thing about the dependent origination teaching is you can You can toy with it, use it as a toy at different levels of the dependent origination. So you can see things at the point of craving, or you can see things at the point of liking or not liking. And then you can like or not like something and stop it at any point. So Right View can happen at any point of dependent origination. You can have Right View at when there's craving, and that's the way that the craving will subside. But then you can also have right view just at the point of feeling. So at the point of pleasant or unpleasant feelings, and just see it for what it is, pleasant or unpleasant feelings that are appearing and disappearing, and then it won't even develop into craving. So at any point, there is the opportunity to wake up, to have a look at what's going.

**Speaker B:** On.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. All right, Pietro, if Good to see you, brother. Is there any other questions? No? Okay. Yeah, sorry. I'm probably going to end this one short today because I have an international flight I have to catch too. I'm flying to Thailand. Yeah. So like, I just realized this morning that you have to give more time for international flights. So I'm gonna head out, but it was— thanks for coming, everyone. Um, it was lovely to see you, and, uh, I hope that your practice goes well. Have fun in Thailand.

**Speaker B:** Have a safe flight.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. Thank you, brothers. Take care. Bye-bye. See you soon. Take care. Bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points:

**Core Topic:** The talk centers on the **Kaccānagotta Sutta (SN 12.15)**, focusing on the meaning of **Right View** (*sammā diṭṭhi*), the first factor of the Noble Eightfold Path, and its relationship to **Dependent Origination** (*paṭiccasamuppāda*).

**Main Themes & Insights:**

1.  **Supramundane vs. Mundane Dhamma:** The speaker clarifies they are interested in the **supramundane Dhamma**—the teaching that leads directly to the end of suffering—rather than teachings aimed at better future lives (mundane Dhamma).

2.  **Right View as Freedom from Extremes:** The sutta's core instruction is that Right View avoids the two ontological extremes of **existence** and **non-existence** (or "form" and "emptiness"). One should see experience directly:
    *   When phenomena are present, acknowledge their presence (don't dismiss them as "empty" or non-existent).
    *   When phenomena cease, acknowledge their cessation (don't cling to them as still existing).
    *   This is a **common-sense, direct observation** of reality without conceptual overlays or biases.

3.  **Right View and Bias:** The world is bound by attachments, clingings, and biases (including the deepest bias of "self"). Right View involves not getting involved with these. By dropping biases and the "lens of self," we can see reality clearly, preventing self-fulfilling prophecies of suffering.

4.  **Right View Sees Dukkha Directly:** The practical application of this "middle way" of seeing is applied to **suffering** (*dukkha*). With Right View, one has no doubt: "stress, when arising, is arising; stress, when passing away, is passing away." This clear recognition is independent and key to release.

5.  **Dependent Origination as the Middle Teaching:** The Buddha teaches "via the middle" by explaining **Dependent Origination**—the conditional sequence from ignorance to the "mass of suffering." This is not a metaphysical theory about the beginning of the universe, but a **here-and-now map of how suffering arises and ceases** in immediate experience.
    *   **Forward Chain:** Ignorance → Volitional Formations → Consciousness → Name & Form → Six Senses → Contact → Feeling → Craving → Clinging → Becoming → Birth → Aging & Death.
    *   **Reverse Chain:** The cessation of ignorance (i.e., the establishment of Right View) leads to the cessation of each subsequent link, ending the entire mass of suffering.

6.  **Key Discussion Point - Are We Born from Suffering?** A participant (**Speaker B**) questions if life itself originates from suffering/craving (e.g., is procreation always rooted in craving?). The speaker's (**Speaker A**) response clarifies:
    *   **Birth in this context is psychological:** It refers more to the **moment-to-moment "birth" of the sense of self** and identification with experience, not just physical birth.
    *   **The problem is identification, not phenomena:** Suffering (*dukkha*) is not the raw experience itself, but the **ignorance** that takes it as "me" or "mine." The entire process of Dependent Origination happens impersonally.
    *   **The escape is in seeing cessation:** All experience—thoughts, sights, feelings—is constantly arising and passing away. **Right View sees this cessation clearly**, leading to non-attachment and release. The end of suffering is felt as the **relief when a dukkha-laden experience vanishes**.

**Conclusion:** The talk emphasizes that **Right View is the foundational practice** of seeing experience without the extremes of eternalism or nihilism, and without the bias of self. By applying this direct seeing to the chain of Dependent Origination as it happens now, one can arrest the process at any link (e.g., at feeling or craving) and move toward the cessation of suffering. The ultimate goal is a profound, firsthand realization of the ceasing of all dukkha.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors** and references a core **story** to explain the Buddhist teachings.

### **Metaphors:**

1.  **The Lens or Filter:** The speaker repeatedly uses the idea of a lens, filter, or bias through which we see the world. Our preconceptions, conditionings, and especially the sense of "myself" distort our direct experience.
    *   *Example:* "We experience reality through the lens of myself. And we end up missing a lot of things... Because we filtered out so much information through the lens that this is me."

2.  **Self-Fulfilling Prophecy:** This is used to describe how our mental biases create our reality.
    *   *Example:* "If you think the world is a lousy place... well, the world will be a lousy place... It's gonna be a self-fulfilling prophecy."

3.  **A Common-Sense Approach:** Right View is described not as a complex philosophy, but as a simple, direct way of looking at things.
    *   *Example:* "Right view is a common sense approach of just looking directly at our experience of reality and seeing it for what it is."

4.  **A Toy (for investigation):** The teaching of Dependent Origination is presented as a practical tool for exploration, not just a doctrine.
    *   *Example:* "The cool thing about the dependent origination teaching is you can toy with it, use it as a toy at different levels."

5.  **Birth and Death on a Micro Scale:** The macro concepts of birth and death are metaphorically applied to moment-to-moment experience.
    *   *Example:* "You're being reborn every moment. Every moment a thought arises... it passes away, and it dies." He applies this to senses, feelings, and breaths.

### **Story / Sutta Narrative:**

The primary story is the **Kaccānagotta Sutta (SN 12.15)** itself, which the speaker reads and explains. The narrative structure of this sutta provides the framework for the entire talk:

*   **The Setup:** The monk Kaccānagotta asks the Buddha to define "Right View."
*   **The Core Teaching:** The Buddha explains that the world is entangled in the polarity of "existence" and "non-existence." Right View avoids these extremes and sees the world simply as it originates and ceases.
*   **The Practical Application:** This view is then linked directly to the **story of suffering (Dukkha)**: seeing stress arise as just arising and pass away as just passing away.
*   **The Mechanism:** The Buddha then narrates the **story of causality**—the chain of Dependent Origination (*Paṭiccasamuppāda*). This is the detailed story of how suffering originates (from ignorance to birth, aging, and death) and how it ceases (from the fading of ignorance to the cessation of the entire mass of suffering).

The speaker uses this sutta's narrative to drive home the point that the Buddha's teaching is not about metaphysical speculation ("Does everything exist or not?") but a practical, moment-to-moment story about how suffering is created and how it can end.

**In summary:** The talk employs metaphors of **distortion (lens), self-created reality (prophecy), and investigative tools (toy)** to illuminate the core **story** from the sutta: a practical, non-extreme path of seeing experience directly to unravel the chain of suffering.
