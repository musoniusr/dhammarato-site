Or check, maybe you already have a smile on your face. Relax your face. So nice. So keep on tranquilizing the body while breathing. Invite comfort and ease while breathing in and spread it throughout the body while breathing out. See how you feel in your head, in your face. How is your face? Is it tensed? Is it relaxed? Feel your eyebrow and see if this area is relaxed or tense. And if it is tense, you just relax it. See your eyes. Relax the eyes. Relax the cheek. Relax the mouth. Smile and relax. Ah, so good, so simple. We don't need more than that. Why would we? See your throat, feel the air passing through the throat, and relax the throat. Relax the neck, the tensions in the neck, in the shoulders. Let your shoulders down. Spread the good vibration throughout the arms, from the shoulder to the fingers, through the wrist. Relax the arms. So nice. You don't need to do anything right now. You don't need to move your arm. You don't need to move your hand. If you feel that you want to move the hand, you just put them on stop. And relax the hand and then the fingers. So good. Don't need to build tension. You don't need to be on guard. It's okay right here and now. Everything is okay, you are safe. No need to be on guard, there is no danger. You just need to be on guard of what's happening in your mind and in your body, that's it. But you don't need to be on guard of what's happening outside. Because outside is just safe and secure. What a relief! You don't need to prepare yourself to run from the danger. No danger. Ah, so nice. Be aware of your trunk as well, your breast, your stomach. Be aware of your back, the upper back, the middle of the back. You can, for example, you can feel the clothes touching your skin. Be aware of the lower abdomen, the hips, the pelvis. The buttocks. So if it's difficult to those areas, you can just try to feel the contact with the clothes. Ah, so nice. Keep on relaxing with the breath. Keep on tranquilizing the body.

**Speaker B:** And at.

**Speaker A:** The same time, you experience the whole body while relaxing. Be aware of your legs. Your thighs, your knees, your calves, your ankles, Ankles. Your feet. Your toes. Relax. Keep on relaxing. Keep on taking your time to slow down. So nice. We can take our time now. We don't need to rush. We have permission to slow down. Isn't it nice? So keep on spreading good vibration throughout the body. Try to feel the whole body at the same time. So you can sweep throughout the body. No need to go too much into detail in all the sensation. Just try to see the body as a whole and sweep throughout the body while breathing in and breathing out. You breathe in, you invite comfort. You breathe out, you spread the comfort throughout the body. Ah, you can do this. And if it's difficult to feel the different parts or the body as a whole, you can take your time to feel the contact of the clothes or the contact of the mat over your body. It will help. So take your time to relax. Very important step, very, very important step. Don't build up tensions. Stop building tensions. Stop it. On the contrary, you relax the body, you slow down, you give yourself permission to slow down, and you spread the relaxation through the body. So from the top of the head, you relax the face, you relax the forehead. You relax the eyebrows, the eyes, the cheeks, the mouth. Make sure you're smiling. Subtle smile. That not creates any tension on your face. You are happy and content right now. So simple. You enjoy this moment because you are relaxed. This is so nice. You don't need to think about what happened today or what will happen tomorrow. Just this moment is enough and is satisfying. Stop thinking about the past and stop thinking about the future. Come back to the present moment. Isn't it nice? Isn't it enough? Yes, it is. It is enough. So keep on spreading the good vibration through the throat. Through the neck, through the shoulders and arms, to the fingers, through the wrists. Keep on sweeping the good vibrations throughout the trunk, Feel your lung. Feel your heart slowing down. Feel your back relaxing, your hips.

**Speaker B:** Your.

**Speaker A:** Pelvis floor, the lower abdomen. Keep on spreading good vibrations. Everywhere. Keep on relaxing the body, tranquilizing the bodily formations.

**Speaker B:** The tensions that you have.

**Speaker A:** The tendency to build. Keep on relaxing them. Take your time to do that. This is very important. And realize that right now you are good, you are okay, you are very comfortable, you are at ease. How nice it is. Keep on spreading rapture throughout the body. Keep on experiencing pleasure. Make this moment pleasurable. Allow yourself to do it. You have permission to experience pleasure right now. How nice it is. You don't need to rush. You don't need to build tension because there is many things to do or danger to escape from. No, you can just cultivate pleasure in your body, cultivate relaxation, spread relaxation throughout the body, through the legs, to the toes, through the knees and the ankles. You keep on spreading good vibration from the top of the head to the tip of the toes. Again and again and again, you sweep. Ah, this is so nice, so pleasurable. What a relief it is. We don't need to build up, build up tension right now. We don't need to be on guard of the outside danger. So nice. Keep on spreading good vibrations. If you feel relaxed enough now, you can let the breath become normal, become natural, and keep on slowing down the process. Keep on reversing the process. Keep on slowing down the cycle. Keep on reversing the stress. You keep on slowing down. You let the breath become natural. So what do you see right now? Do you see what's happening in your mind? Do you see the craving that keeps on rolling? Congratulations if you see it. Very good. Do you see the aversion of not doing anything? Very good that you see it. It's okay. You don't need to have aversion because everything is fine right now. You don't need to want anything else than this moment. So keep on stopping the unwholesome cycle of stress and wanting and not wanting. Instead, you gladden the mind by telling yourself that actually, right now, I don't need anything. Everything is fine, safe and secure, sharing good Dharma with friends.

**Speaker B:** Wow, so nice!

**Speaker A:** How fortunate are we! And you see the restlessness in the back. Very good. Don't worry about that. It's just.

**Speaker C:** Anicca.

**Speaker A:** Instead, realize that right now you don't need this restlessness because there's nothing to do. Can you see the doubt? What am I doing here? Who is this person guiding the meditation?

**Speaker B:** Does she have credentials? Are we practicing correctly?

**Speaker A:** What are we doing now? Very good if you see the doubt. So you can dispel the doubt.

**Speaker B:** And.

**Speaker A:** Come back to the sutta and check if you are practicing correctly. So you keep on coming back to the present moment whenever you catch that your mind is wandering away for whatever reason. You come back to present moment and you realize that everything is cool. We're good. Nothing to stress about. So you keep on gladdening the mind whenever you see any of the hindrances. And at the same time, you keep on relaxing the tensions in the body that have the tendency to rebuild themselves. So catch them, and whenever you catch them, you relax them with the breath. Or you relax them with a thought, with a wholesome thought. No need to move. Part if you don't feel comfortable, of course. Keep on smiling. Check your face, check the tensions on your face. They're a good indicator of your attitude. Take your shoulders and let them drop. Take your hands and put them on stop. Nobody is asking you to do anything right now. You can just stop. Drop the pressure. Drop the burden. Reverse the cycle of stress. Come back to the present moment. Don't let your mind roll in wanting or in stories. Each time you catch your mind doing that, you just come back to the present moment and realize that everything is actually perfect right now. Actually, you don't even have to think about anything right now. If you think about something, if you allow something to be in your mind, this has to be wholesome. So check that what is in your mind is wholesome, and you keep on cultivating it. If it has already arisen, you stop it and change it to wholesome by coming back to the present moment and realize everything is good and perfect right now. Wow, we're so fortunate to share the good Dharma together, to be happy together, to take this time to just be happy together. Doing nothing. So you cultivate the thoughts to prevent unwholesome thought to arise. Unwholesome thoughts have the tendency to create tensions in the body, so that's why we relax the body to erase any trace of unwholesome. Tensions in the body are only echoes of unwholesome thoughts, so we don't need to build tension right now. Because we're safe. So we just have to guard the mind. That's the origin of the tensions. That's the forerunner. So guard the mind, my friend. Guard the mind because the dangers actually come from it. They don't come from the outside, they come from inside of your mind. So keep on guarding the mind from the unwholesome And moment by moment by moment, you remember to look and to cultivate the wholesome. No need to do anything right now. So, so simple. Why would I complicate things? No need to complicate anything. This is so simple. I don't need to complicate things. I just need to be happy in this moment and in this moment. And in this moment and cultivate it. Okay, my friend. So how do you feel? Palma, do you feel better?

**Speaker D:** Yes, was a good session. Thank you so much.

**Speaker A:** Good. So what were you doing with your mind?

**Speaker D:** Keeping it in the wholesome and relaxing against—.

**Speaker A:** Oh, sorry, I don't hear you very well. Sorry.

**Speaker D:** One second. Yeah, keeping the mind in the wholesome and relaxing any tensions that are building up within the body.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker C:** Good.

**Speaker B:** We don't need to go back into the past. You're right.

**Speaker D:** Yeah. Do you want to stop the recording?

**Speaker B:** No, no. Oh, you want me to stop?

**Speaker D:** I wasn't sure what was the intention. Otherwise it might be too long. Was the intention as a guided meditation? Was the intention of recording to help somebody through a guided meditation?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, but we also, we can also record our discussion if you want, but if you don't want, I can stop the recording, your choice.

**Speaker D:** No, I don't have an issue.

**Speaker B:** Okay, anybody have an issue that we record? If we have a discussion, if anyone wants to share or maybe ask questions or share something. Is it okay if I still record?

**Speaker C:** It's all good.

**Speaker B:** Okay, great.

**Speaker D:** So one question that came up, Anna, one question that came up is, is there a speed at which one scans the body from the head to toe, or the speed doesn't matter?

**Speaker B:** Or just be what?

**Speaker D:** Is there a speed at which one should scan the body from the head to toe? Should it be faster? I mean, within 3 seconds maybe, I don't know. Or does it not matter much?

**Speaker B:** No, I mean, no, I mean, there is no, you know, I think it's not correct if we set some goal, you know, or, you know, some goal to attain in the time of the scanning of the body, like scan the body, as you can, you know, in the time, like take your time, no problem, okay? Don't create some more tension, like I have to rush and scan the body in 3 seconds, you know what I mean? Like just relax, okay? You scan the body, if ever you are able to scan the body very quickly, very good, but if it doesn't happen, no problem, don't create tension, you know?

**Speaker D:** All right, understood.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like if it happens, because like your mind is very calm, your mind is very clear, and you don't have any tensions in the body, and so the scanning is very fast, then good. But if it doesn't happen, no problem.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Like you just, you just keep on relaxing. That's it. So anybody has.

**Speaker A:** Something to share or something to question, ask? By the way, I am French and.

**Speaker B:** So my English is far from being perfect and so sometimes I don't— and we are coming from every part of the world here, which is very nice, but we have so many different accents And so sometimes I take some time to adapt and understand you very well. So forgive me about that, okay?

**Speaker C:** Hi, Anna. Hey. Thank you for the guided meditation.

**Speaker B:** My pleasure.

**Speaker C:** It really helped to cultivate some joy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, relaxation. Right, it's so nice and it's very nice to do it together, right?

**Speaker C:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker B:** I mean, I find it really helps too. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so that's nice.

**Speaker E:** Sorry.

**Speaker B:** Tell me.

**Speaker C:** So like the pointers, like at some point when you mentioned that there is some tension in the back, do you notice it? At that point it's like, yeah, it is there, yes. And then there's the brain starts worrying about, oh, let me try to loosen this up, this is very tight and all. And the point is that, oh, don't need to worry about this. That really helps, that it's okay, doesn't have to be a certain way.

**Speaker B:** So these are things that you have to remind yourself in your day-to-day life.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Because it's really nice to practice together, it's helpful, it's nurturing, I think. But we have to keep on practicing outside of the guided meditation, you know. So the pointers that I give, that you have to apply them during your day-to-day life, remind yourself, oh, but I don't need to create tension right now, actually. Even in the midst of stress, you can remind yourself, you come back to present moment, and then you realize present moment, you know, like, present moment, whatever it is, is okay, you know. Even in stressful situations. So, Yeah, keep finding yourself moment by moment by moment by moment, you know, that's it, that's the practice, that's the training, that's the practice.

**Speaker C:** Another thing I found is When I sit and try to do relaxation, like same way, just body scanning along with breath, there is some point where you're watching out for hindrances, but then some sleepiness or torpor will start rolling in, and that is the one which is a little sneaky. Because you're relaxing and that at first it won't seem like a hindrance. You're slowly drifting away. So yeah, that started happening at some point because the body was really relaxed.

**Speaker B:** So which one?

**Speaker C:** That is also an hindrance. Sleep or torpor. That started happening, but then just reminded that this is also hindrance. You can come back. It can be like the breath can be energizing and you can come back to joy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, you did it right.

**Speaker A:** Congratulations. Exactly.

**Speaker B:** So today I posted something in the Dharma study part of the platform about drowsiness, and these are the recommendations of the Buddha about drowsiness, so you can check it out if you want.

**Speaker E:** Because.

**Speaker B:** He gave a very detailed recommendation about that, like see what thought is causing drowsiness, and if it doesn't work, you can just rub your ears, and your face. And if it doesn't work, you can just put some water on your face, you know, stuff like that.

**Speaker C:** Is it the AN 10.54, Samatha Sutta?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think so. I don't remember the number, honestly, but.

**Speaker A:** You can find in In the.

**Speaker B:** Anapanasati Dhamma.

**Speaker D:** It had 8 points listed.

**Speaker C:** Oh, I see. I see.

**Speaker A:** I think I didn't find the number actually.

**Speaker C:** I see.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it is descriptive message. Yes, I found. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So these are, you see, there are 8 points. So this one is very clear actually. The other hindrances, I didn't find, but maybe there is. I think it's interesting to search about, like find the instruction of the Buddha he gave on how to overcome hindrances. Because he gives some throughout the suttas. But this about sleep and torpor is very clear, and everything is in one sutta, you know, so this one is easy. But the other one is everywhere in the sutta, so it's not easy to find them. But he did give a recommendation to overcome the hindrances, so it's really interesting, right?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, it is. I'll read and include that in my practice. Thank you for sharing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, my pleasure. And Yeah, like he say that we.

**Speaker A:** Should see how they arise and how they pass away.

**Speaker B:** So that's when the mind is very collected, then you can see the beginning and the end of the thoughts, the sensations, everything that we have to observe, we can try to catch the beginning and the end. So that's when we begin to experience impermanence. So I didn't want to go there in the guidance, because I wanted to insist, and also because actually I was creating tensions, so I needed a lot of relaxation, so that's why I did that. But yeah, we can go deeper, and then you know, collect the mind enough to see the beginning and the end. So yeah, you can check this.

**Speaker A:** Study, Dhamma There are many references you can read. By the way, that's very important to.

**Speaker B:** Read and to do your own research to know how to practice. Don't take what anybody says for granted and check for yourself.

**Speaker A:** That's very important.

**Speaker B:** Because otherwise you will end up in a cult.

**Speaker A:** Hello, Creo.

**Speaker E:** What's up?

**Speaker A:** How are you?

**Speaker E:** Doing all right.

**Speaker B:** Are you relaxed?

**Speaker E:** Meditated a little bit yesterday. Yeah, I'm relaxed enough.

**Speaker B:** Okay, good, because we are relaxed.

**Speaker A:** We just finished the practice now.

**Speaker E:** Nice, nice. So I meditated for 40 minutes straight yesterday, which was pretty nice. I just put on a mantra that I liked and just sat down and didn't even want to get up.

**Speaker B:** Good.

**Speaker E:** I don't meditate often though. Yeah, by myself.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so at some point you're not creating tensions, because sometimes, you know, when it's too long, actually, we don't realize, but we are having unwholesome thoughts and creating tensions in the body, but we don't see it, because it's too long.

**Speaker E:** Usually when my muscles start hurting from sitting in the same position for too long, I'll just get up.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker B:** You just get up.

**Speaker E:** I've got a very comfy couch.

**Speaker B:** Okay. That helps. But, you know, like in the mind, when we are not paying attention, you know, like we're, yeah, like for example, We're getting drowsy, we're not paying attention, and then we are having, you know, because the practice is too long. My point is to say that sometimes a short practice is actually better than a long one.

**Speaker E:** I'd agree. Because there's returns on benefit, you know, if it starts slimming out and actually giving you a negative return, it's not worth it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker E:** I go to a Tibetan Buddhist temple on Wednesdays when I can.

**Speaker B:** Okay. So what are you practicing there? I'm curious because I don't— I mean, yeah, at some point I tried some Tibetan practice when I was in Bodhgaya actually, because I was staying in a temple there. But, uh, I, I didn't, uh, like, it didn't resonate with me. What are you practicing?

**Speaker E:** Um, yeah, what I can talk about is what I do on Wednesdays, and with that, I basically just go over a teaching which usually just talks about general, like, Tantra teachings or Mahayana teachings, and then we meditate for 40 minutes and have a discussion. That's about it. I don't really do much Tantra at all. Yet. I don't feel comfortable with it personally, but I really have a lot of respect for that form of Buddhism. So that's what I do.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Usually Tibetan practice.

**Speaker E:** It's intense.

**Speaker B:** You have to have a lot of respect. I mean, how can't you have respect for that? I mean, there are so much rituals and stuff.

**Speaker E:** Well, the craziest thing about it is I haven't really done too many rituals myself, but when I just chanted a mantra one time, I straight up saw it. Like I was just meditating on the mantra, chilling, doing my thing. And then all of a sudden in my vision with my eyes closed, I could see Tibetan scripture just rotating in front of me like an illusion.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker E:** So at that point I knew I was in pretty deep and I just decided to chill out a little bit. Have a little more respect for what was going on.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker E:** Because at that point I had— I didn't think of it as like magic or anything, but it was just more like I had no expectations. Now I understand that there are things you're supposed to do.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Well, I don't know anything about it, honestly. I like you. But yeah, that's why you are used to a 40-minute format.

**Speaker E:** Oh, that's just how long I'd sit before I get up. But yeah, I am used to 40 minutes on Wednesdays.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Okay, cool. Well, I hope you will join us next time when we practice Anapanasati here.

**Speaker E:** Oh yeah, I love Anapanasati. From what I understand, it's almost a complete path.

**Speaker B:** Exactly, a complete and very simple path. Very simple.

**Speaker E:** I'm playing a video game right now, actually. It's pretty fun. Do you guys like to play games?

**Speaker B:** Well, personally, I don't play video games, but maybe some here do, I don't know.

**Speaker E:** Oh, it's a little unhealthy to play them all the time. I understand that. I just like to play to relax, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because video games are a bit stimulating for the eyes and the senses in general, no?

**Speaker E:** Definitely.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** But I've spent time on computers my whole life, basically. To be honest.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** That's your— in that I spent a.

**Speaker E:** Lot of time like web browsing. No, it was just like my hobby as a kid. I loved computers.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Okay. Yeah, computers are sometimes very addictive, right?

**Speaker E:** They can be.

**Speaker B:** So does anybody have something to say.

**Speaker A:** About the practice that we just shared?

**Speaker E:** What I have to say is that.

**Speaker D:** Nothing else. I know. Thank you so much.

**Speaker A:** Okay, anybody?

**Speaker E:** I like the longer breaths than the shorter breaths. Not sure if it's helpful though.

**Speaker B:** You like what?

**Speaker E:** The longer breaths when meditating, like the deeper ones.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah. So what have you noticed with that?

**Speaker E:** They feel more natural. Shorter breaths carry a lot of stress.

**Speaker B:** Oh, it feels more natural to have longer breaths? Oh, interesting. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Well, yeah, for me, I would say.

**Speaker B:** That longer breaths are more relaxing. But at some point, when you are relaxed, You can drop the longer breath and just come back to natural breath, which usually are shorter. And then when you come back to natural breath, actually the mind becomes more quiet and you can see clearer what's happening. In the mind. Well, what do you think for you?

**Speaker E:** I think that there are a lot of qualities to the mind that are not apparent in our day-to-day life. When we take a second to just sit back and analyze, we can notice a lot more.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's why I think I had.

**Speaker E:** A realization yesterday that meditation is almost like going into space to see the Earth from a bigger perspective. Like we step outside of time temporarily when we meditate almost.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we take a step back.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's a way to see it.

**Speaker D:** So the shorter energizing breaths can be used effectively when the body is either too restless or too sleepy to bring back.

**Speaker E:** Oh, so it's like a fire breath then almost?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, quicker shorter breath to energize the body. And then it can go down, go back to a long, deep, relaxing breath, which afterwards can go into a natural breath, as Anna was saying. So shorter, energizing breaths can be used for specific situations.

**Speaker B:** You mean like, okay, when you do it on purpose, Like it's not natural, like you shorten the breath. Yeah, okay.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, you could also have a longer out-breath.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Say, you know, if say fear has come in and there is tightness in the body, in the chest area, say, so having a longer out-breath and quickly using energizing short breaths can be helpful to bring the body to a more stable state and then going back into a long easy, deep, easier breaths, which would be the baseline. And then once the body calms down, it can go into a more natural, shallower breath instead of having to take a big, deeper, longer breath. Because the body has enough oxygen and more relaxed.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it's like longer breaths are tools.

**Speaker B:** To really relax the body. And you can even make a sound when you breathe out. Like, you know, it really helps, especially for people with anxiety, actually.

**Speaker D:** In effect, the longer out-breath, right? The sigh creates a longer out-breath.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah. But come back to the sutta and read.

**Speaker A:** And find your like find your way of doing it and adapt it to the present moment as well.

**Speaker B:** Like if you are, if you feel already relaxed, you don't need to have.

**Speaker A:** Too much long breath, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, if you don't have too much tension, then you can directly go to natural breath and just be aware of natural breath.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Along with the body.

**Speaker D:** A lot of the steps of Anapanasati is like that, understanding which one to use when.

**Speaker B:** Which one?

**Speaker D:** The different steps, items, different items within Anapanasati can be used. At different times. So understanding when to use them is helpful.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yeah, exactly. Like, you don't have to do it in the same order. That depends on the situation in the moment. Like, you have to adapt each moment. You have to adapt.

**Speaker D:** Correct. Yeah. Initially, it can be very awkward. But it gets a little better over time.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, awkward like what?

**Speaker D:** Like when I was experimenting with breath, maybe I might breathe the wrong way. So instead of calming down, might breathe in too much and aggravate the body tension. Those kind of things.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker B:** Like experiments. That's very important. You experiment by yourself, you see the consequences on your mind and your body, you come back to the suttas, you compare, you see if you're practicing well. This is very important to do that. So do you have, in Tibetan practice, you also have breathing meditation?

**Speaker E:** There's Vipassana and Samatha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay. And how do you do it?

**Speaker E:** Vipassana is insight meditation and Samatha is calm abiding.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so how do you do Samatha in Tibetan Buddhism?

**Speaker E:** I only really know Vipassana personally. But from what I understand, Samatha has to do more about not having an object, but Vipassana has an object.

**Speaker B:** But you haven't practiced with your Tibetan Sangha?

**Speaker E:** A little bit here and there.

**Speaker B:** But you haven't— There's not a lot.

**Speaker E:** Of like practice going on, to be honest.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay. What is there then?

**Speaker E:** Sorry, I'm just getting distracted. I've attended a couple of teachings from the spiritual director there, and it's a very interesting tradition because they put a lot of emphasis on guru devotion, which I think is important.

**Speaker A:** On devotion, okay. Hello, Mark 80s, how are you? Hello.

**Speaker E:** Mark 80s.

**Speaker D:** He seems to be typing on the chat. Oh, do I have to use my mic?

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah. Okay, sure.

**Speaker A:** Okay, hello. Yeah, okay, yeah, we just finished the practice, so we were sharing some different things about the practice, about Tibetan Buddhism, because Kriyo is a part of a Tibetan Sangha, so we were sharing different stuff.

**Speaker E:** Like with my practice, at least I've realized that I'm not really where I need to be to be practicing Tantra. So I rely more on just prayer, Mantra, and meditation at this point. But okay, okay, I'd like to get more involved in the more esoteric stuff, but it just takes me— it's just going to take me a while.

**Speaker B:** All right. So does anybody have something else to.

**Speaker A:** Say about what we just practiced, what we just trained in?

**Speaker B:** Sorry, we don't hear you very well, Mark Eighties.

**Speaker E:** What was the practice?

**Speaker B:** Well, it was Anapanasati, always. That's what we practice.

**Speaker C:** Here.

**Speaker B:** You know, so today we took our time to relax the body, actually. You took a lot of time to.

**Speaker A:** Do that, because it's a very important.

**Speaker B:** Step in the Anapanasati practice.

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** It seems to be very basic and simple, but actually this is very important. So I think we have slowed down a lot, and so now we're not even able to speak, right?

**Speaker A:** Okay, you guys, well.

**Speaker B:** As for me, I will have to go, but if you want to keep on practicing together.

**Speaker A:** You can do it. Don't forget to practice outside of those calls, of course.

**Speaker B:** This is really, really important. So like we said with Anmol, remember the pointers. See when you're creating tensions in your body, in your mind, and when you see them, you congratulate yourself because you have seen them. And why do you do that? Because it's a wholesome thought. Now, congratulate yourself, remind you that you are actually okay, you're good, you're doing it correctly. So that's why you congratulate yourself and you keep on relaxing in the day-to-day life, so that you don't create more tensions. Because if we really observe, we are constantly creating tensions actually in the day-to-day life, because we are constantly rushing, running after things, running after goals and achievements, you know, and that's how we create tensions. So keep on reminding yourself that you are okay every moment and keep on relaxing. Okay?

**Speaker C:** Yeah. At the time when you'll be the most tense, say some deadline came, something heavy came, that is the point where we tend to forget. I think in those moments is where it is most helpful and most required. So I think just practicing it as it comes, as and when something arises.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but when you forget, your body will show you.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Like your body will show you what's happening in your mind, actually.

**Speaker C:** Generally heartbeat, fast heartbeat can indicate that there is some— Yeah, that's true.

**Speaker B:** Well, me, I'm old, so I have a lot of pain all over the body, but I think you don't because you're young. I don't know everybody, but— So yeah, heartbeat is a good indicator. Yeah, so check the indicator in your body. And check your face also. Like, if you see that your face is tense, that you are frowning your eyebrows, You know, stuff like that. You don't smile. Usually when you don't smile, it's because you are thinking something unwholesome. So these are good indicators to watch.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so I think I will come back tomorrow for another practice, so you will be welcome.

**Speaker C:** Thanks, honey.

**Speaker A:** Thank you, my pleasure.

**Speaker B:** So you come whenever you see me going live and the Hangout, you come and you just join.

**Speaker A:** Okay?

**Speaker E:** Later, guys.

**Speaker D:** You guys have a good one.

**Speaker B:** Okay, bye-bye.

**Speaker C:** All right, thanks. Thank you, everyone.

**Speaker A:** Thank you.

**Speaker B:** See ya.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by **Speaker A (Anna)**, is a guided meditation and subsequent discussion focused on the practice of **Anapanasati** (mindfulness of breathing) with a strong emphasis on **relaxation and cultivating wholesome states**.

Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Part 1: Guided Meditation (Core Teachings)**
The primary instruction is a systematic relaxation of the body and mind using the breath as a tool.

*   **Relaxation First:** The practice begins not with intense concentration, but with "open awareness" of the breath. The goal is to deeply relax the body by taking long, deep breaths.
*   **Breath as a Tool:** The breath is used to "invite comfort" on the inhalation and "spread relaxation" throughout the entire body on the exhalation. Breathing out through the mouth or making a sound is encouraged, especially for relieving anxiety.
*   **Body Scanning:** Practitioners are guided to scan the body from head to toe, releasing tension in each area (face, shoulders, back, etc.). The emphasis is on feeling the body as a whole and using the sensation of clothing or a mat as an anchor.
*   **Cultivating Safety and Ease:** A central theme is the recognition that "you are safe" in the present moment. There is no external danger, so the habitual "guard" and tension can be dropped. This is framed as a profound relief.
*   **Guarding the Mind:** Relaxation of the body is directly linked to the mind. Physical tensions are seen as "echoes of unwholesome thoughts." The practice is to "guard the mind" by preventing unwholesome thoughts and cultivating wholesome ones (e.g., gratitude, contentment).
*   **Present-Moment Satisfaction:** The meditation stresses that the present moment, when relaxed, is "enough and is satisfying." The instruction is to stop dwelling on the past or future.
*   **Working with Hindrances:** As the mind calms, practitioners are encouraged to notice the **Five Hindrances** (craving, aversion, restlessness, doubt, drowsiness) without worry. The antidote is to "gladden the mind" by returning to the present and recognizing that everything is already okay.

### **Part 2: Group Discussion & Q&A**
After the meditation, the group discusses practical aspects of the practice.

*   **Speed of Scanning:** There is no correct speed for body scanning. The key is to avoid creating new tension by rushing. Speed will vary naturally with the mind's clarity.
*   **Applying it Daily:** The pointers (e.g., "I don't need to create tension right now") are meant to be used in daily life, especially in stressful situations, to reverse the "cycle of stress."
*   **Dealing with Drowsiness:** Sleepiness/torpor is acknowledged as a sneaky hindrance during deep relaxation. The Buddha's practical advice (from a sutta like **AN 7.61**) is referenced: change thoughts, rub ears, splash water on the face, etc.
*   **Breath as a Flexible Tool:** The discussion clarifies that breath length is a tool:
    *   **Long breaths** relax and tranquilize.
    *   **Shorter, energizing breaths** can counter restlessness or drowsiness.
    *   **Natural breath** is the goal once the body is calm, allowing for clearer insight into the mind.
*   **Independent Study & Adaptation:** A crucial point is made: **Don't take any teacher's word as final.** Practitioners are urged to read the suttas (original Buddhist texts), experiment for themselves, and adapt the practice to their present-moment experience. This is presented as a safeguard against dogmatism.
*   **Broader Context:** The talk briefly contrasts this Theravada-based Anapanasati with a participant's experience in Tibetan Buddhist practice, highlighting differences in method (e.g., use of mantras, guru devotion).

### **Overall Essence**
This talk emphasizes **Anapanasati as a simple, complete path** that begins with profound physical and mental relaxation. The core message is that peace is found by stopping the creation of internal tension, recognizing the safety and sufficiency of the present moment, and diligently guarding the mind against unwholesome states. The approach is practical, encouraging personal experimentation and verification against the Buddha's original teachings.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, this is a guided meditation session followed by a discussion. The primary speaker (Anna) uses several core metaphors and refers to one key story (the sutta) to guide the practice and explain the philosophy behind it.

Here are the metaphors and stories used:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The Cycle of Stress / Unwholesome Cycle:** This is the central metaphor. The mind and body are seen as being caught in a repetitive, automatic loop of creating tension, craving, aversion, and restlessness.
    *   *Examples:* "cycle of stress and wanting and not wanting," "unwholesome cycle of stress," "reverse the cycle of stress."

2.  **Guard / Watchman:** The mind must be actively protected, but not from external threats. The "danger" comes from within.
    *   *Examples:* "guard the mind," "be on guard of what's happening in your mind and in your body," "the dangers actually come from it. They don't come from the outside, they come from inside of your mind."

3.  **Spreading / Sweeping Vibrations:** Relaxation and wholesome states are described as a substance or energy that can be actively disseminated through the body with the breath.
    *   *Examples:* "spread the comfort throughout the body," "spread the good vibration throughout the arms," "sweep throughout the body."

4.  **Cultivating the Garden:** The mind is like a garden where wholesome states must be nurtured and unwholesome ones (weeds) must be prevented or removed.
    *   *Examples:* "cultivate pleasure in your body," "cultivate the thoughts to prevent unwholesome thought to arise," "cultivate it."

5.  **Dropping the Burden:** Tension and stress are framed as a physical weight or pressure that one can choose to put down.
    *   *Examples:* "drop the pressure," "drop the burden."

6.  **The Forerunner:** Bodily tension is not the root cause but a secondary effect, a messenger that signals the primary issue in the mind.
    *   *Example:* "Tensions in the body are only echoes of unwholesome thoughts... That's the forerunner."

7.  **Stepping Back / View from Space:** In the discussion, a participant offers a metaphor for meditation itself.
    *   *Example (from Speaker E):* "meditation is almost like going into space to see the Earth from a bigger perspective. Like we step outside of time temporarily."

### **Stories / References**

1.  **The Sutta (Pali Canon Scriptures):** This is the primary story or reference point. The speaker repeatedly directs the practitioners to check their experience against the foundational Buddhist texts.
    *   *Examples:* "you can dispel the doubt and come back to the sutta and check if you are practicing correctly," "come back to the sutta and read," "But come back to the sutta and read."

2.  **The Story of the Hindrances:** While not a narrative tale, the speaker personifies the five hindrances (craving, aversion, restlessness, doubt, drowsiness) as characters that appear in the mind. The practice involves recognizing these "characters" (e.g., "What am I doing here? Who is this person guiding?") and skillfully dealing with them.
    *   *Example:* "Do you see the craving that keeps on rolling?... Do you see the aversion?... you see the restlessness in the back... Can you see the doubt?"

3.  **The Buddha's Instructions (AN 10.54 - Samatha Sutta):** During the discussion, a specific sutta is referenced as a "story" or set of instructions for overcoming drowsiness.
    *   *Example:* "He gave a very detailed recommendation about that, like see what thought is causing drowsiness, and if it doesn't work, you can just rub your ears, and your face..."

**In summary:** The talk uses **metaphors of cycles, cultivation, guarding, and spreading** to make the meditation process tangible. It grounds the practice in the **story and authority of the Buddhist suttas**, encouraging practitioners to use them as a manual. The "story" of the meditation itself is one of recognizing and disarming the inner hindrances that create suffering.
