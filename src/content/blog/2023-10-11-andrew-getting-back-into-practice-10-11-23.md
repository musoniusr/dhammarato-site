### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So Andrew, like I said, it's really good to see you again.

**Speaker B:** You too.

**Speaker A:** And the question that you're asking is the question that you ought to be asking, and it's the question that, let us say, those who are making good progress continue to ask themselves. And that in fact, another way of turning that question into something quite noble is to ask the question, "Is everything okay right now? Am I satisfied with the way things are?" This is in fact the invitation to gladden the mind right then. By saying, yeah, everything really is okay. Yeah, it's not done yet, but we're getting it. All right. And that, you see, the mind, we could call it kind of like a rut. When I was a teenager and a kid, around Dillon, South Carolina, there it was quite swampy, the Pee Dee Swamp area. But there's more than one river, and it's a vast area of northeast and South Carolina is a swamp. And in fact, Francis Marion was known as the Swamp Fox because he would attack the British And then he would go hide in the swamp where they couldn't catch him. But that, that area, that swamp is vast, is like 8 or 9 counties of the 46 counties in South Carolina. So with that setting, at one time I worked while I was in high school, the State Highway Department, which meant that we had to go out into that swamp. Quite a lot, all right? And that was dirt roads there, a lot. And because it was a muddy swamp, that meant that the dirt roads that we were on often were quite ruddy. They had ruts in them, deep ruts, that anytime that you travel on soft ground, that you're causing— or even with your feet, you move the ground around and it creates a path or a rut, right? Okay, so you can then say that people live their lives in a rut. They create a pathway in their mind, and then they stay on that path and get stuck in a rut. And so we have to remember that we don't have to stay in that rut. We can cut a new path, but we have to keep remembering because the easy way out is to get back on the path that then is full of ruts. This whole point that I'm making here is that we have to continue to remember to come out of the rut.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I guess— go ahead. I was just gonna say, part of the frustration I'm having is that I'll have these experiences. Like a few weeks ago, I had a really great session with my acupuncturist, and like, it was like a state of like calmness and openness. And then even like the next night, I was able to like let a lot of things that would normally kind of like get stuck— thoughts and feelings— just kind of pass through me and like get to a very calm and grounded state. And then I'm like, oh cool, like I know how to do this now. And then the next day, it doesn't seem like that ability to be so porous is accessible to me anymore.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. That means that we have to actually practice, and sometimes that practicing has to do with getting out of the rut. And you've seen a lot of traffic, a lot of trucks. In fact, I think half of YouTube is watching trucks get out of the mud. All right, and so the mind is exactly that way. So we need to have two things then. Is we have to remember that we get stuck in the ruts. And so the best kind of remembering is to see the rut as we approach it, and then we can avoid it. If we can see that the truck in front of us just got stuck in that rut, then let's not get stuck in that rut too. And so there's that quality of remembering. In the Dharma, we call that Sati. And remembering means to come back into the here-now, and then in that example of seeing the truck in front of us stuck in the rut, stuck in the mud, we can then look with our eyes, well, we can look with our mind's eye too. The mind gets stuck in a rut, but we can either see that rut coming, because we're remembering to look, and then avoid it. But that's a skill. The very, very beginner is already stuck in the mud, and so it's going to take the effort to get out of the mud. And so there's a lot of little toys and techniques that we can use to help us get out of the mud, And one of them is to see clearly. An example of that would be that a woman who is getting older is taking care of her elderly father, and nobody else in the family is helping her do that. But when she recognizes that her dad created the situation because he did not plan well, for his old age. And when she sees it all, it's not me that's stuck with caring for my dad, it's my dad is the one who's stuck in the rut and I'm trying to get him out of it. All right, so often that's where it comes to, is instead of trying to help ourselves, the real issue is taking care of others, taking care of things that other people care about. All right, so an example of that is having a job, right? Why do you have the job?

**Speaker B:** So I can pay for rent and living expenses.

**Speaker A:** And, uh-huh, but you can find ways of not having living expenses. You can find ways of eating But in our culture, we get stuck in the rut of, oh, I've got to be employed. And so every day we get up and we get back in that rut. All right, so arguing is another kind of rut that people will get into, that when there's a disagreement, instead of just working it out We will argue it out, and oftentimes, in fact, almost never does an argument wind up getting people out of the rut. Nobody changes their position. In a big kind of way, about 10 years ago, I think it's because of Richard Dawkins, but there were several of them that went on tour, Christopher Hitchens and Lawrence whatever, from some university in Arizona. But they would go around to both universities and churches, arguing over the existence of God with Christians. And in these debates and in these arguments, it depended upon who was in the audience. If these arguments happened in a church, then most of the audience was Christians. If they had these arguments at universities, then the students were generally on the side of the atheist. So, the point is, at the end of the argument, when the show was over and people would go home, nobody changed their opinion. Everybody was still stuck in the same rut that they had before. Now here's the point, is that because both sides are in a rut, the real issue is, is that nobody knows. Nobody knows. And if you don't know, why do we care? And eventually I think that that kind of dawned on people, because I haven't seen any of those debates in about 10 years now, maybe 15 years. They stopped having those debates because there was no solution to the debates. Well, does that happen in your mind also? You argue with yourself in your own mind and then you don't come to a conclusion, but you go back and have that same argument again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, now the question is, can you remember Oh, here's a rut that I'm about to get into, or here's a rut I'm stuck in, can I not do that? So, this is in fact the Eightfold Noble Path of the Buddha, is to wake up and take a look at what we're doing, and then make a change, to avoid that rut, or to get out of that rut. So, this is the Sati, the Ditti, and the Viriya. To open up, to wake up, is the Sati. And that's the main one, because the skills will come of looking once we wake up. That in fact, waking up and looking together is now what in Western Buddhism is referred to as mindfulness, is that we remember to look. So the skill that you're talking about that you need is the skill of waking up to remember to look. And there's a lot of little things that we can do that will help develop that skill, because it's a skill. It's a skill to wake up and be in the here and now. And then in fact, you could call it an anchor or a trigger. Now most of the time that we use the word trigger, it means a negative thing. Like the mother sees her baby fall on the floor and she's triggered into action. Well, we can actually program in triggers for us to go into wholesome actions. And the wholesome action would be to come out of those ruts of the mind. And so the skill that we need to work on and develop over and over again is that skill to remember. Now what happens is that students start to practice. They begin to get Sati, to get out of the ruts. Sometimes they even spend quite a lot of time ruttless. They're not in the ruts. And so they kind of think, almost a formed thought, that they don't have to practice Sati anymore, because they've got it. That in fact, every student does that. I did it several times. In fact, I would say that I did it at least 4 great big times, that I just stopped practicing. And in fact, another point that I can make with it is, because I spend so much time with students on the internet, is that I have a great deal of time to have those triggers to come back. That in fact, when I hear the Skype ringing, that's an opportunity to take a deep breath, to come out of what I was doing, etc., like that. And then when you got on the call with me, you said something and that triggered me and I took a deep breath. And relaxed. So we need to have those triggers, we need to program them in. And one of the ways to do that is by being around other people who have those triggers, to stay around the noble people, to gain great value by being around others who are gaining great value. We can, in our language, we call that rubbing it off. You rub against something and it rubs off on you. All right, but basically it's a kind of trigger, and we do that with everything. There's a Pali word for it, it's called Mudita. You probably heard the word Metta, Karuna, Mudita, Upekkha. Okay, so that Mudita, is that rubbing off, and that we can do that in many, many different ways. An example is that if someone is angry, they invite everybody to get angry. Or if someone is angry, it can also invite people into being quite fearful. Because they're afraid of the anger. But that's a trigger. So someone's anger will either trigger someone else into great fear, or that anger will trigger them into anger. In fact, you could say that that's built into the DNA. It's part of our instincts. And we have the word of fight or flight. But that fight or flight is always triggered with something. So one of the things that you can plan on doing is to get into a mode of being around good triggers. And one of the clear examples of that is Alcoholics Anonymous, or AA. I mentioned that often. Not that I want my students to go to AA, but AA is very good at We're just one little thing, but if we would apply the AA codes to everything that we do, then we would come out of all kinds of addictions. And so in AA, what they do when someone really wants to stop drinking alcohol, they recommend don't go to the bar, stay away from your drinking buddies. Don't go to the liquor store, even don't even go down the street that the liquor store is on, right? This is what we're talking about. But what they do recommend then is to go and spend time with other AA people. In fact, everyone in AA gets a mentor or a monitor, and that every time that a new alcoholic that's in AA wants to take a drink he will remember to call his monitor or his mentor. So his mentor is going to help him to not drink. This is done big time in Buddhism. This is what Sangha is all about. You've heard it is called the Triple Gem: the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha. And so the Sangha is that which means that we're going to be around other people who will help remind us, who will trigger us into wholesome thoughts. And so, this is one of the reasons why we have had all of these centuries, we have the noble Bhikkhu Sangha of monks, but there are wats and temples and all kinds of Buddhist places. And the reason for those is so people can come together, in a wholesome way and help each other. It's sort of like an anti-bar, because when people go to the bar, they go there to drown their sorrows and their miseries in alcohol, making things worse. Here we're going to go to the wat or to the temple or to a group where they can help us, basically tow us out of our own ruts. And so this is what the value of Sangha is, and I highly recommend that you go to temples, go to Watts, come to our Discord group, come to the Skype groups, and read and post and be around other people who are noble. That's one of the things, by the way, that on a lot of social media that has Buddhist things the people who are on the group don't have noble mindsets, and so they begin to argue with each other over details of Buddhism. This happens a lot on Reddit. They argue with each other because they are in the mode of arguing rather than in the mode of having a noble mind. And so, it is actually possible for someone that has a non-noble mind to trigger a noble mind into being not noble, but it's also quite probable that the noble mind is going to stay firm and solid and then trigger the non-noble mind into noble thinking. And so it's all about reminding, and if you can develop a daily practice, that daily practice then will be the daily practice of remembering to have that noble mind, to remember to have wholesome thoughts, to remember to be here now. And so we need these triggers because most of us are stuck in our own swamp, getting stuck in ruts, one after another. And we have to remember to get off the path, to get off of our old way. Go ahead, I'm listening.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, one of the biggest ruts that I seem to fall into has to do with like how I relate to like the physical body, like especially when I come to stillness or when I sit. There's just frequently there's like a lot of different areas of like discomfort and things like that. And so I get into the habit of like, even if I try to say like, oh, like this, like, is there a problem with this? Like right now, like there just seems to be a strong habit of the mind to be like, yes, this is a problem. And I guess I would love some insight as to how do I know the difference between if I'm practicing gladdening the mind or if I'm practicing being in a rut and just trying to tough it out.

**Speaker A:** All right, this happens with everybody at every age. The toddler, or actually the crawler who is learning to walk, is unsure and unsteady. When the toddler begins to stand up, they fall down a lot. They want mommy's hand. They want someone to pick them back up. So we get actually formed many of our ruts when we're still in diapers. And when they grow up, let us say at the other end of the scale, now someone has gotten old and gotten weak and feeble. And in a way, many of them, they even have a product called Depends. We go back into the diaper stage. All right. So that point then is, is that, oh, I cannot sit on the toilet. If I do, I can't get back up. My legs are weak or I'm sitting on the toilet and I need hand support. And so I use my hands because I have already the preconceived notion that my legs are weak. But if one has mindfulness, they can say, "All right, I can hold on with my hands, but I'm going to use the power of my legs to get up off the toilet." This is an important point, because most people, their legs will get weaker and weaker and they depend more and more on their arms or more on a walker or support or whatever. But if they have mindfulness, they can say, I can regain the strength of my legs. I can do this. I can get over it. So when you have a pain in your shoulder, the way to talk about that is, is that, oh, I'm glad I see that. 'Let me have some comfort for that and heal it.' We often, when things start to deteriorate, we let them, because it's in our rut mind system, it gets worse and worse and worse. Can we come out of that rut and say, 'No, I can regain the strength of my mind, I can in fact heal the body, the body can heal itself if we have the mind state for it. Have you ever heard of the term psychosomatic? Oh yes, this is what we're talking about. The psycho is more important and more powerful than the somatic, the body, that in fact it's the mind that helps the body get weak and tired and, oh poor me, 'Oh, my arm hurts, oh, it'll never get good again.' Here's the point about that: when people have an injury, let us say a broken leg, a broken arm, or maybe trauma to the face, or they've been in an automobile accident, something like that, the thoughts that they have on the way to the hospital, while they're in the hospital, and after they get out of the hospital, Most of the pain is mental. It's not physical. Most of that pain is, oh, poor me. Rather than having the thought of, I'm going to get out of here. I can get out of here. All right. The Buddha actually— this is in Sutta number 39 when he talks about in relationship to the hindrances. He likens it into being sick, being perhaps in the hospital. Have you ever gone and been in the hospital? And then you got out of the hospital, right? You're not in the hospital now. So let's look at this sequence. On the way to the hospital: oh, poor me, I need help, I need the doctors, I need the hospital, oh, this is an emergency, oh, I feel really bad, etc., like that. But the day before you get out of the hospital, what are your thoughts? I want out of here. Right. Yeah. The best thing that can happen to someone is to get out of the hospital, to get out of being sick. Another example of that is, is that you have been on journeys, you carried bags to the airport and gotten on a flight, etc., like that, or you can become halfway around the world, perhaps. And then when you arrive, you get to your destination, you set down the bags, what a relief it is. The journey is finished. I got here without getting robbed. I got here without losing my baggage. And so this is actually the same point, to be free from the hindrances. And getting free from the hindrances would be like the pain in my shoulder. Oh, it hurts. That's that negative. That's going to the hospital. Oh, I need some balm. Oh, I need some rub. And then the other attitude would be, I can take care of this. This is temporary. I can get over it. I can change my mind state about that injury. It is not permanent, okay? That the athlete who breaks his leg or has a knee injury, the thought of, "Oh, I'll never play football again," or, "Oh, I'll never play basketball again," or, "Oh, poor me, this leg is so important to me," and that's the most of the suffering. The knee itself is not suffering, it's, "Oh, poor me, I can't have my knee now." And so those are the kind of thoughts that we have when we have bodily sensations, and those will happen during meditation. Now one of the things that is kind of hidden in the Suttas, you have to kind of read between the lines, in the Anapanasati Sutta, it talks about the body, and in another passage of it, it talks about being comfortable. Well, the way that we would practice then meditation is, let's get the body comfortable so that the mind can become comfortable, and in fact the mind was getting the body comfortable, mind over matter, you know, the mind is the forerunner. So by getting the body comfortable, we've already started getting the mind comfortable and then later with the comfortable body in reality, you're sitting there comfortably, and we're having thoughts of comfort, we begin to feel comfortable. So the body and the mind work together to get the feelings. And this is the way that we would practice. So when you sit down for meditation, always sit down comfortably. Now this is something very strange about Western Buddhism, because Western Buddhism is all about meditation, And they go to sit in a meditation hall without a chair, sitting on the floor. Many of them will pile cushions under themselves trying to get comfortable on the floor. Well, the Asian people already lived their whole lives on the floor. In the tropics, you don't need furniture. It's only in cold places that you want to get off the floor because the floor is too cold. In the tropics, the dogs want to lay on the floor because the floor is the coolest part of the room. Dogs would often not want to live on the bed. They want to lay on the floor because the floor is cooler, right? So with that in mind, people who are practicing meditation and wanting to sit on the floor, they wind up making the body more uncomfortable. But the Buddha doesn't say go sit in an uncomfortable posture in a meditation hall that's full of all kinds of people in that meditation hall. Rather, the Buddha recommends to go to the forest, go to a foot of a tree, go to an empty hut, and sit down and keep the back straight. This is— I've taken a long time to get to this point for you, and that is, is that when we're sitting up straight, then gravity is pulling us down straight. But if we are bent, then gravity is pulling us down, making these muscles hurt. This is why many meditators will have back pain. And what they do to the back pain is say, 'Oh, this is hurting. Oh, poor me.' And then they'll slouch even further and they'll make the pain even worse. So when you have a little bit of pain, the right thing to do is to sit up straight with the idea, 'I can handle this. I can do this.' It's an attitude.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And then what do you do with the What can you do with the fearful thoughts that arise, like, "Oh, what if I can't?".

**Speaker A:** Well, the way that we handle those thoughts is by first of all recognizing those thoughts. We have to be able to see them, which means that we have to look. And if we can look in advance, then we can see it coming. That this is in fact what we were talking about in wisdom, wisdom and skillful means, is that we can see it in advance, or we can see it coming rather than already there. So if you can see the rut in the road coming, you can avoid the rut, watch where you're going, or you got to take all that effort to get back out of the rut. So which of them are you going to do? Are you going to see the little bit of fear when it arises and tell yourself, oh, we can handle this? Or are you going to be in that rut, fearful? Now here's one of the things that is true both about anger and fear. Is that when people are in a state of fear, they cannot think straight. When people are angry, they cannot think straight. So if you can see the anger as it's arising, it's easier to deal with than if you're in a full-blown rage. The same is true with with fear, that if you can see the fear coming up in you, that's the best time to deal with it. But that's the part that takes mindfulness. This is why we want to practice this mindfulness. Also, fear, like anger, manifests in the body. And the way that that happens is with chemistry. Now, in the time of the Buddha, they didn't do a whole lot of autopsies. They didn't figure out how the body works and things like that. And so our modern science can actually help us in our practice of meditation by understanding that the mind, especially the reptilian mind, is where all of these feelings come from. There's a couple glands back there, the pituitary gland and the pineal gland, and they work together to send chemical messages down the lymph system to the adrenaline gland that is located in the back, close to the kidneys. Okay, why is that? Why isn't the Adrenaline gland up there instead of the Pineal and the Pituitary glands? The answer to that is that the Adrenaline gland needs to manufacture chemicals. It manufactures Cortisol and it manufactures Adrenaline. Where does it get the products from doing that? Out of the body's garbage pit, the kidneys and the liver. And since the kidneys and the liver are located down here in the lower part of the back and then on the side, that's where the adrenaline gland is. So it can go get all the crap that it needs to put that stuff together to make adrenaline. And then later, when the adrenaline is broken down, it'll either come out through the breathing or it will again be regathered by the by the liver and the kidneys. Okay, so what happens then is, is that the adrenaline gland can either drip adrenaline into the system or it can pump adrenaline into the system. This is why people can get slowly angry, or they can get really angry, or they can get slowly fearful, or they can get purified really quickly. It's because of— it's sort of like a water tap. You can either have it to where it drips, or you can have it where it's full on, right? And a whole lot of places in between. Now here's the point: many of the thoughts that we have will drip a little bit of adrenaline. And if we would stop having those thoughts— I mean, people can sit in meditation and they start to think about the argument that they had with Aunt Susie yesterday. Or maybe they are in meditation after they've had an argument with their wife or husband. And there they go with that adrenaline dripping, dripping, dripping. But if they are mindful, if they can wake up and recognize that all the thoughts that I'm having is what's causing the discomforts in the body. And if I would change those into wholesome thoughts, like, oh, everything's going to be okay. Well, I don't have to— Susie's not here. I don't have to argue with her right now. Why am I arguing with her in my mind when she's not even here? I am so glad that Aunt Susie is not in the room. She's not here. So why do I keep bringing her back in the room? This is actually what we mean by the here-now. When we are here now, all of the things that we argue and worry about are generally not here. They're in the past, and we bring them up and rehearse them and rehash them, bringing on these bodily pains and discomforts to where the Buddha recommends, no, let's get the body comfortable. And let's keep it comfortable because we're thinking about the body being comfortable, we're going to remember to sit up straight, we're going to remember to take a deep breath, we're going to remember to breathe long deep in-breaths and breathe long deep out-breaths, that that out-breath is in fact really, really important. Why? Because it rids us of the residue of the adrenaline. A lot of amino acids as well as carbon dioxide will come out of the body. You probably heard about acid, that there's a certain amount of acid we need in our stomach to digest food. But then we have things called heartburn, which means we've got too much acid. Okay, guess what? There's a mechanism in the brain that detects the acidic level of the blood. And the more carbon dioxide there is in the blood, the more acidic the blood is. Why? Because there is a thing called carbonic acid. This is called acid rain. The carbon dioxide in the air mixes with the water molecules that in fact carbon dioxide often is a contributor to rain. So this is carbonic acid. The body can detect that, and various things can happen, and that is a yawn. People will yawn when there's too much carbon dioxide in their body. They will also take a deep breath. But this is a mechanism. The question is, can you do this consciously rather than have it as the automatic system. So you remember to take a deep breath, you remember to sit up straight, you remember that it's better to sit up straight even though it takes a little bit of muscle, it takes a little bit of effort, that's going to just remove a whole lot of pain. And people have pain from the lower back all the way up into the shoulders, into the neck, into the head. People give themselves headaches. Because of the tension that's caused by the tightness in the body. That's a good point right there, okay? Why not, if the shoulder is tight, why not give it a massage? It's okay to do that. In meditation class, they say, oh no, you're supposed to hold still. Well, that's more for advanced meditators. Why? Because with them, they're going to be able to relax that tension with their mind. But beginners, they need to actually do it with their hands so that they can rub those muscles and do this, do this kind of thing to set up. But we need to remember to do it before we get it done by a habit, because people will often do this just like you did. All right, that— can we do that stuff consciously, knowing what we're doing, or does it happen as a habit or an automatic response? This is mindfulness, to be there knowing what you're doing. And so the best way to develop that is by practice. The second best way to do that is by being around other people who are practicing, to be around nobles, to spend time with them, to get good vibes from good people rather than giving ourselves our old bad vibes, or we're still going and getting our bad vibes from other people. So those are two things. So let's talk about the first one. In the Anapanasati Sutta, the Buddha recommends Mindfully breathing in and mindfully breathing out. What that means is that we're going to train Sati with each in-breath. We need a little bit of Sati to remember that this breath is going to be a long breath and to remember that this breath is going to be a long out-breath. So breathing long over and over again requires the mind to remember that this is going to be a long, deep breath. And when we're not thinking about it, then occasionally we might have a long, deep breath because of the automatic system. But we want to make this conscious. And by breathing long in and breathing long out mindfully has two benefits. One is it energizes the body. And throws out all the poisons of the body, but number 2 and more importantly, is it develops Sati. It develops remembering. So if you can begin to remember to take a long deep breath over and over and over again, then when you get up off the cushion, you're kind of a lot more mindful. And so you can be mindful of all kinds of things. An example would be, even if the shoulder hurts, remember that you have control over how you're going to react to that shoulder pain. Are you going to add extra pain to it by not liking it? Are you going to say, oh, it's going to be okay, I can heal that, let me massage it, let me love it? Another way of talking about it is, is that we are critical of it. Oh, you're not supposed to have shoulder pain. 'Oh, that's bad, oh, that's terrible,' instead of having nurturing thoughts of, 'Oh well, the shoulder needs a rest, it needs to relax, it needs a little bit of massage, let me nurture that shoulder.' Another example, and in fact I just saw this with a student yesterday and made point of it, I see him scratching his arm scratching his back. Well, scratching actually disturbs the skin, that you make a rash worse by scratching it. And it is also critical. I'm scratching because I don't like that sensation. Well, what can we do instead? We can get a bomb, we can get an ointment, we can get— like in Thailand, they're very famous to have Tiger Balm or Monkey Balm, and you take some out and you gently rub it on the area. That is, in other words, we start to nurture the body. Rather than being critical of the body. But we have to remember, that takes effort to nurture the body. But often, like the analogy of the truck stuck in the mud, we just spin our wheels making it deeper. We scratch that itch and it makes it worse. In fact, you probably noticed that before, that you've got an itch and you scratch it and you scratch it and you scratch it, then finally you stop scratching, you're paying attention to it, and it feels a whole lot worse after you scratched it. And so we scratch it again, making it worse, rather than putting an ointment. So it all has to do with whether you're going to be nurturing yourself or being critical of yourself. Critical of the body is going to make it worse. Oh, poor me, my legs don't work anymore, and therefore I have to use my hands to stand up. Versus, "Hey, I'll use the hands as support, but I'm going to use the muscles of the legs to stand up." Or, "Hey, the itch is there, I don't have to scratch it, I can put a soothing balm on it instead." So this is the way that we begin to change our way of looking at it. In fact, this whole point is mindfulness, mindfulness, mindfulness. To nurture, remember to take care of, remember to look at what you're doing and change it, to stop our scratching and start applying ointment. But the second point then is, let's stay around other people who are practicing that. Let's get some good friends. Let's have those people remind us. And one of the things that we have here is we have both Discord— we've got a Discord group and we've got several Skype groups. And so I would highly recommend that you start spending more and more time in our Skype groups, because you're there, you're going to be around more noble people. And I also recognize that everybody does it. We come in, we get a whole load of Dharma, we really feel great, and then we go off, "I've had enough of this," and then we stop practicing, we lose our skill, we begin to forget more and more and not remember more and more, we don't look, and then we'll go a while and then something will happen, maybe a catastrophe, and then we'll get back into the Dhamma. Or it might be circumstantial. To be honest with you, when I left the monkhood in 2008, I stopped all kinds of practice. I'm good now, I'm retired, everything is hunky-dory. But then in 2015, Ajaan Po asked me to start teaching again on the internet, and that's the best thing that he ever did for me because he got me back into the practice. And so that's what I recommend to you, is you be around noble people and they can get you out back into the practice or keep you into the practice rather than letting it fall by the wayside for some reason or another. That don't go through the various ways that I did and just stop and forget, get into all kinds of trouble, all kinds of misery. Let's stay noble, let's be around noble people, let's remember to be noble, let's remember that we can be OK. So, do you have anything to say about that?

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] Oh yeah, that's very helpful. There's a number of things that I look forward to continuing to remember and to return to and to practice.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. Well, I'm really glad that you called.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, me too. Thank you so much.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I'm really glad to see you again.

**Speaker B:** Likewise.

**Speaker A:** So, uh, spread your joy to your friends. Spread your joy with the nobles. Well, remember, practice. Every breath is an opportunity to practice if you can remember. Remember to keep the body comfortable. Don't put it in strenuous situations, not yet. There will be times later when you can test it. And Bhikkhu Buddhadasa makes a big point of it, is the best time to practice meditation is when one is sick, when the body is sick. Don't let the mind get sick. Because the body is sick. We can say, most people when their body is sick, they say, "Oh, I can't do anything. Oh, I hate this. Oh, I may never get over it. Oh, this is terrible." Those are the kinds of thoughts that ordinary people have that we learned in diapers when we were falling down and needed to get back up. We'll go to the hospital. "Oh, poor me, I need a doctor." I need some medication, that kind of stuff. And the right attitude would be when we're sick is, wow, the body is sick right now, but the mind's not sick. The mind's going to help the body. That when a body is sick, when it's tired, it needs oxygen, it needs air. Let me remember to breathe. And so even though in normal situations when you're not sick, That's a good time to practice, but the best time to practice is when we need it the most: when we're sick, when the shoulder hurts. So now you can use the body as a trigger. Any time that you have any bodily pain, any situation, any shoulder hurt, any back pain, any headache, any cuts on the hands or the fingers— in fact, The reason that we get cut is because we're not mindful. We would rather get that stick cut than care for our fingers. And so we'll cut ourselves or we'll scratch, making the— disturbing the skin, making the itch worse. That in fact, here in Thailand, we've got mosquitoes. That's one of the reasons why there's so many different versions of Tiger Balm and Monkey Balm and that kind of stuff. But the Westerners, they come to Thailand and when they get bitten by the mosquito, What do they do? They scratch because they don't like it. So use your body as a trigger to make— to start anointing the mind, to put some ointment on the mind, to nurture yourself.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, thank you. That's it. That's a really good reminder.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. Well, let me go now. I've got another student calling. All right, but what I would really like for you to do is to remember that you've got friends here. Come back on Skype. Have you been on the Skype UK or the Skype US groups?

**Speaker B:** I'm part of the Skype US group, but I have not been active on it for a while, but I'll get back into it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, get back into it. You'd be a welcome addition.

**Speaker B:** Thank you so much.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. We'll see you later, Andrew.

**Speaker B:** See you later, Dhammarato. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by **Dhammarato (Speaker A)** in conversation with **Andrew (Speaker B)**, centers on the core Buddhist concept of **mindfulness (Sati)** as the skill to recognize and free oneself from habitual mental patterns, metaphorically described as **"ruts."**

Here is a summary of the key points:

### Core Metaphor: The Mind Stuck in a Rut
Dhammarato uses the vivid analogy of driving on muddy, rutted roads in a swamp. Our minds, through habitual thinking and reacting, create deep psychological ruts (e.g., anxiety, self-criticism, arguing, fear). The path of practice is to first **remember (Sati)** we are in a rut, and then skillfully get out of it or avoid it altogether.

### Main Themes & Advice:

1.  **The Primacy of Mindfulness (Sati):** The fundamental skill is **remembering to wake up to the present moment**. This allows us to see a "rut" (unwholesome thought pattern) as it approaches and choose a different path. Without this awareness, we spin our wheels, deepening our suffering.

2.  **The Problem of Ephemeral Insight:** Andrew expresses a common experience: having a breakthrough state of calm and openness, only to lose access to it the next day. Dhammarato explains this is why **consistent practice** is essential—the mind habitually falls back into its old ruts unless we continually remember to cultivate a "noble" or wholesome mindset.

3.  **Practical Tools for Getting Out of the Rut:**
    *   **Gladden the Mind:** Ask, "Is everything okay right now?" This simple question can shift perspective and invite contentment.
    *   **Use the Body:** Practice **long, deep, conscious breathing** (as in the Anapanasati Sutta). This serves two purposes: it clears bodily tension/chemical stress (like adrenaline) and, more importantly, it *trains the muscle of mindfulness* with every breath.
    *   **Change Your Relationship to Discomfort:** When physical pain (e.g., in meditation) or emotional distress arises, **avoid adding mental criticism** ("Oh, poor me"). Instead, **nurture and soothe** the sensation with a compassionate, healing attitude—mentally or with physical care like massage or balm. The mind can help heal the body.
    *   **Program "Triggers":** Use daily events (like a Skype ring, a moment of pain, or a deep breath) as reminders to return to the present and a wholesome mind state.

4.  **The Critical Role of Sangha (Community):** We are heavily influenced by our environment. To stay out of ruts, it's vital to **surround yourself with noble friends** (Sangha) who are also practicing. Their wholesome mindset "rubs off" (related to *Mudita*, appreciative joy) and provides supportive triggers, much like a sponsor in AA. Dhammarato strongly encourages participating in practice groups (like their Skype communities) for this support.

5.  **Wisdom in Daily Life:** The talk applies the "rut" analogy to various life situations:
    *   **Arguing:** Debates (internal or external) where no one changes their mind are futile ruts. It's wiser to recognize "I don't know" and let go.
    *   **Habits:** Recognize automatic, critical reactions (like scratching an itch) and consciously replace them with nurturing actions.
    *   **Sickness:** The **best time to practice** is when you are sick or in pain. Instead of falling into the rut of "poor me," use the discomfort as a trigger to nurture the body with the mind and breath, recognizing that much suffering is mental.

### Conclusion:
The talk is a compassionate guide to **continuous, gentle remembering**. The goal is not to achieve a permanent high state, but to develop the resilient skill of mindfulness that allows you to see the ruts of the mind, avoid them when possible, and have the compassionate tools to extract yourself when you inevitably get stuck. The journey is supported by daily personal practice and the invaluable companionship of the Sangha.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses a central, extended metaphor and several supporting stories and analogies to illustrate his points about mindfulness and mental habits.

### **Primary Metaphor: The Mind as a Road/Rut**

This is the core, extended metaphor that structures the entire talk.

*   **The Rut:** The ingrained, habitual patterns of thinking and reacting. Life's difficulties, negative thoughts, and arguments are all "ruts" the mind gets stuck in.
*   **The Swampy Road:** The context of life, which is messy, muddy (like the Pee Dee Swamp), and prone to creating these ruts.
*   **Getting Stuck:** The state of being lost in unwholesome thoughts, fear, anger, or physical discomfort identification.
*   **Seeing the Rut Coming:** The skill of mindfulness (*Sati*)—awareness that allows you to recognize a habitual negative pattern *before* you are fully caught in it.
*   **Getting Out of the Rut:** The effortful practice (*Viriya*) required to change your mental state once you're already stuck. He compares this to the popular online videos of "trucks getting out of the mud."
*   **Cutting a New Path:** Actively choosing a different, more wholesome response, which requires repeated remembering and effort.

### **Supporting Stories and Analogies:**

1.  **The Swamp Fox (Francis Marion):** Used to set the geographical scene and emphasize that the "swamp" (of mental habits) is a vast, familiar, and historically significant terrain—not an abstract concept.

2.  **The Woman Caring for Her Elderly Father:** A story to illustrate "seeing clearly." The shift from "I'm stuck with this burden" to "my *father* is stuck in a rut (of his own poor planning), and I'm trying to help him out" reframes the situation and reduces personal suffering.

3.  **The Atheist vs. Christian Debates (Dawkins, Hitchens):** An analogy for futile mental arguments. He points out that these debates changed no one's mind because each side was "stuck in a rut." He then directly compares this to the internal arguments we have with ourselves that also go in circles without resolution.

4.  **Alcoholics Anonymous (AA):** Used as a direct analogy for the Buddhist concept of *Sangha* (community). Key parallels:
    *   **Avoiding triggers:** Just as AA advises avoiding bars and drinking buddies, one should avoid environments and people that trigger unwholesome mental states.
    *   **Seeking positive community:** Just as AA recommends spending time with a sponsor and other members, one should seek out noble friends (*Sangha*) who "trigger" wholesome thoughts and remind you of the path.

5.  **The Toddler Learning to Walk / The Elderly Person with Weak Legs:** A paired analogy to show how mental ruts are formed early and can persist. The toddler's uncertainty and the elder's preconceived notion of weakness are both "ruts." Mindfulness allows the elder to choose to use their leg strength despite the habit of relying on arms, just as one can choose a new mental response.

6.  **The Hospital Visit:** A story to illustrate the shift from a suffering mindset ("poor me, I need help") to a liberating one ("I want to get out of here"). The journey *to* the hospital is like getting caught in a hindrance; the desire to be discharged is like the mind seeking freedom.

7.  **The Adrenaline Gland & Chemical Drip:** A scientific analogy to explain how thoughts manifest physically. Anxious or angry thoughts are like a "drip" of adrenaline/cortisol into the system, creating bodily tension and discomfort. Mindfulness allows you to "turn off the tap."

8.  **Scratching an Itch vs. Applying Balm:** A simple, powerful analogy for critical vs. nurturing self-relationship. Scratching represents a critical, reactive habit that makes things worse (a "rut"). Applying balm represents a mindful, nurturing response that soothes and heals.

9.  **The Mosquito Bite in Thailand:** A concrete, everyday example of a "trigger." The itch of a bite is an opportunity to either fall into the habitual "rut" of scratching or to practice a mindful, nurturing response.

### **Overall Narrative Purpose:**
All these metaphors and stories serve to make abstract Buddhist principles (*Sati*, *Dukkha*, *Sangha*) tangible and practical. They frame the practice of mindfulness as:
*   A **skill** (like driving a truck on a muddy road).
*   A **remembering** (to see the rut).
*   A **communal effort** (like AA or a *Sangha*).
*   A **shift from criticism to nurture** (from scratching to balm).
*   An **active process of path-building** rather than a passive state of being.
