### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, so yes, I'm working for like— I'm working for myself, so I'm actually an entrepreneur, but I have a rent that I pay to a gym so that I can coach people there. And so now with the practice, I'm finding work less and less important, so I'm working less and less. And I don't, uh, too, brother. Yeah, I bet. And so I don't have to— I don't, um, go out of my way to find new clients. I mean, if some people come to me, that's cool, but I don't like too much to just go and talk to people and, uh, and try to get a new person to, to come to my, uh, I mean, to, to get in shape. So I let them come. That I have less and less clients, especially with the summer and stuff. And so sometimes I feel the feeling of insecurity because since I have that rent, I cannot just not work. That would be cool. Even if I don't get paid, I don't have any expenses. But with the rent, I have to work like a certain amount. And so sometimes that makes me insecure. I recognize it as an hindrance, so I just push it away when I see it. But I like what you say about having friends and who you know, because that's kind of a security too, because you know you're supported. But I was wondering what you would recommend, or maybe just talking about this safety and security Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, let us start from there. I was— but back up just a little bit into the sense that there's actually several issues that we need to discuss. One is the actual feeling of fear, and then the situation of a declining income, and then the alternatives, the new stuff that you're learning that's wanting you to not do that so much. And now you're okay. Guess what? This is quite typical. I think everybody kind of goes through this, and that we can look at the various pieces and various stages of it. And possibly the easiest way to do it is to deal with the fear itself first, because then with wisdom you can deal with the others rather than in fear.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so let's deal with the fact that life is itself insecure, but that you— so far so good— that in fact, anytime that you're feeling that fear is because of the thoughts and the worries that you had about the other two. And so if we can let them go for a while and just work on— let's get the feeling straightened out, because I mean, after all, you're not out on the street, you're not starving right now. This is not a matter of saving your life, okay? That you're, you're asking this question really early, and that's good because we can deal with it really early rather than when you hit rock bottom, which is when Anagami generally gets their people, is when they're when they've hit rock bottom, and you're nowhere near rock bottom. In fact, you're sailing right now, and that's an important way of looking at it, that the only hindrance basically that you do have is the worry about what might happen. Yeah, yes, because it probably won't. And there's something inside that says, oh, if I worry about it enough, then I'll do something.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Well, the answer to that is no, not necessarily, that you can worry and worry and worry and worry and still not do anything about it, or you can stop worrying and then do something about it. And so let's start working on stopping the worry, to put it down, to recognize that in this moment, at least for right now, you're well-fed. Yeah, right now you can still pay the rent. You got that covered for a month or so, at least for this month, you're good. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. So we're working with the positive stuff. You can go ahead and take a sigh of relief for the next 30 days. You're good. Well, at least for the next 30 days, there's no problem. Okay. So if we can get yourself into the state of 30 days is enough, or maybe you might want to modify that. Well, I think it would possibly be better if I had 3 months in advance, then that would feel even more secure.. But I know that I will never feel secure thinking this is open-ended. If this is open-ended, then I'll always feel bad. But if I can shut it down to 3 months or 1 month or something like that, then I know that I can deal with it for the next 3 months. Okay. And so now we can begin to think every time I get worried about it, I can set that worry down and not have to pick it back up for a.

**Speaker A:** Month.

**Speaker B:** 'Let me worry about that later' is something that you can begin to tell yourself. This works well. But right now I could breathe easy. Right now I have the business of getting my mind together, getting the fear out, and becoming friends with myself. Because as we step into the next part, that if you're a really friendly guy you may not have to work so hard at getting clients. But in fact, if you— the clients that you have, if you make good friends with them, know them well, like them, and they like you, then they'll be willing to help you find new people. They'll begin to recommend you because they like you a lot, not because you're a good massage therapist or whatever you do. Because they like you so.

**Speaker A:** Much.

**Speaker B:** So this is the way of starting to understand this, that you can in fact work not in the sense of building up clientele, but work on the sense of making friends.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I like that better.

**Speaker B:** Well, guess what? Remember that we were talking about what you know is what you do? Well, here you're changing the what you know from a clientele list into who you know, your friends. That's the way to say, I don't need to go work on getting a client list or getting to know people that way, in the sense of putting in effort that's different than what you actually want to do, which is deal with people at that at that level. Okay, that you're a trainer. Well, be the best trainer in your own mind, which is the most friendly trainer. That's the best trainer, is the one who's the most friendly, because then the people actually want to come back and see you more often. Yes, yes. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that is that people usually They come back especially to have a friend. I mean, some of them are just paying to have a friend, which is in a way a bit sad, but I see how it works.

**Speaker B:** It is so amazing though to me that the thing that we started talking about before we started recording was about that other thing, and then when you asked the question while it was on the recording, it was the same answer. Yeah, yeah, it's, uh, yeah, that is so amazing. They call that synchronicity. I, what I call it is, wow, look at that, I see that, that everything fits together that way. So yes, that is not, uh, but we were actually talking about it in the sense of the Thai people. Why are the Thai people laid back? The Thai people are laid back because they find much more interest and importance in who they know rather than what they know. Because getting fired from a job doesn't mean anything. I already know all the people that I need to know. So you can look at it from that perspective also with your fear that all you need to do is cultivate enough friends. And then you don't have to worry about the job anymore. The job will take care of itself because your friends help you do.

**Speaker A:** That. Yes.

**Speaker B:** Yes. This Dhamma is really amazing stuff, and it works everywhere, just like it works with the Thai people. It really helps the culture. This is a really, really laid-back culture. I know, I've been here for so many years. And it really is kind of laid back. In fact, the only ones that seem not so laid back are the ones who have to learn to deal with the furong. It's the tourist industry people who know how to deal with the furong. The real Thai people are even more laid back than that because they always have their family. To count.

**Speaker A:** On. Yeah, they feel safe.

**Speaker B:** Right? And so if anybody needs anything in the family, in fact, because I know how the Thai culture works, I've kind of set it up that Tam, my wife, is now the matriarch of her family. That though she's got grandmothers galore, They all are now looking at her because of her relationship with me. But the point is, is that I know that and know how to manipulate it so that this is now my family too. And they come and use that part of it. And I'll always be willing to loan money. Why? Because loaning money to a family member cements the family even more. That makes them beholden to me until the money becomes more important than the friendship, which is what happens in the West. Eventually the money becomes more important than the friendship, but here in Thailand, no, it's all family money.

**Speaker A:** Anyway.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's not mine, it belongs to the family. I bought my way into this family and I really got the star show out of.

**Speaker A:** It. It's a, it's a, it's truly a switch, um, a mindset switch. And then it's on so many levels, so many subtle things.

**Speaker B:** Um, yeah, oh, many psychological levels that have to be surmounted. That's how many different, how much difference there is in the culture. I mean, they knew it, Horace. It wasn't Horace really, it was someone, some Maybe it was Mark Twain, but someone way back when said, "East is East and West is West, and never the twain shall meet." Well, that's not true. Some of us have got pretty big straddle, and I've been able to straddle the two cultures, and that's kind of rare.

**Speaker A:** I know it. Yeah, yeah. So different.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. But I learned to do it at the Wat. If I had not spent so many years in the Wat, then I would not have been able to observe how the Thai culture operates. Without having to jump on it with both feet like all the farang do. Yeah, every farang I've ever met wants to fix Thai culture, and they get so frustrated when all the Thai people get silly about it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I've seen that. And also some, some get kind of resentful, uh, like, for the culture because they feel like, uh, it's not right.

**Speaker B:** Or yeah, yeah, well, it's just different. We don't like what we don't know. It's called the fear of the unknown. And in fact, that's exactly what you're doing right now, or you were. You talked to me about it. It was the fear of the unknown. That if I just enjoy what I'm doing and not go advertise, then I won't have so much clientele, and therefore the unknown will happen.

**Speaker A:** Oh.

**Speaker B:** No, I'm so afraid of that.

**Speaker A:** Unknown. And I know like nothing will be like that bad. I mean, I can find a job very easily.

**Speaker B:** I guess. Ah, but it's easy to find friends. Yeah, but in fact, in fact, that's the way to go. And I mean, if you have to change profession, if you've got all these friends that have been clients, one of them will give you a job or get you one.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's for sure.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's so true, isn't it? Yeah. So it's the friends that we make, not is, is who we know. It's not what we know. Never was. And that's all you have to make that change in your mind, and that will dispel the fear. Oh, now I know exactly what to do. I just go make friends, and that's so much fun to do.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, I will go— I will apply this mindset a lot more, like just going to make friends instead of telling myself that I go to work. I will just go and make friends and hang out with my friends at the gym.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, then you make a lot of friends, and then your whole life is just going to the gym and making out— I mean, hanging out with your.

**Speaker A:** Friends.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, all right, a little 40 and slip.

**Speaker A:** There. Okay, yeah, and also there is a part of me that is kind of afraid to ask for help. I mean, sometimes I don't, like, I won't ask my clients to recommend me, or like if they know someone who wants to get in shape Because I.

**Speaker B:** Feel like— I know, right? You don't have to do that if you make friends.

**Speaker A:** All right, cool.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they'll do that automatically for.

**Speaker A:** You. It felt forced, like, yeah, I'll try to just make friends and they would do that by themselves if they like what we do.

**Speaker B:** I guess. Yes, if you put your energy into making friends that way, one of the benefits is that some people will continue to come to you longer because they're getting even more benefit out of it. Yeah, so that's part of the package right there, is just making friends with the clients you've got, and some of them will stay maybe a week or two longer.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, maybe I'll.

**Speaker B:** Start seeing them outside. Did that really cement the friendship?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that is.

**Speaker B:** True. So I recommend you go ahead.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, I mean, I mean, I might even start to see some of them outside of the, like, of the training session. That way we can have this, because now it's so professional. Because when I started this, I wanted to be like serious and professional, so I kept a distance with my clients and I didn't see them outside. And I tried to, I didn't, you know, make jokes and stuff too much because I felt that would make me look unprofessional. So Now I do it a lot more, but I kind of— you have.

**Speaker B:** My full permission to make that change completely now. That— yeah, you— but here's the point about professional. You've already proven that to the one person that it needs to be proven to. Yeah, you. And so now your attitude of I'm a professional only needs to add that adjective. I'm a friendly professional. In fact, friends is more important than professional, but you've already got the professional down, and everybody who comes to you knows that you're good at it. And in fact, I didn't even have to mention that part of it until now. But yes, you've already got the professional part down, so that's not the issue. Yeah, the issue is, let's not— instead of trying to prove how good I am Let's just allow people to see how friendly you are doing such a good.

**Speaker A:** Job. Yeah, and that sounds really great. I mean, really easy as well. It's not work.

**Speaker B:** It's not, is it? You're right, having fun with people is not so much work, is it? That's why I do these Zoom calls, that I really get.

**Speaker A:** Joy.

**Speaker B:** Well, all right, let's, let's finish now. I think that this has been a really, really good session. We've gone about an hour and recorded about 20 minutes of it, so this is really great. Thank you, this has been wonderful. I'm going to go— I really like this because I'm going to go out and start making some more friends myself. I've talked me into it.

**Speaker A:** All right, I'll go make friends right now.

**Speaker B:** All righty. Well, we'll We'll see you later then.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye. See you. Bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on the provided transcript, here is a summary of the Dhamma talk between Dhammarato (Speaker B) and a Sangha friend (Speaker A):

### **Core Issue**
The practitioner (Speaker A), a fitness coach and entrepreneur, is experiencing a growing sense of insecurity and fear as his dedication to Dhamma practice makes his work feel less important. He is working less, not actively seeking new clients, and is worried about meeting his fixed expenses (like gym rent).

### **Dhammarato's Teachings & Advice**

1.  **Address the Fear First:** Dhammarato identifies three intertwined issues—fear, declining income, and shifting priorities—and advises tackling the **fear of the unknown** first. He notes the practitioner is not in immediate crisis ("you're not out on the street"), so the fear is a mental hindrance (worry) about a future that hasn't happened.

2.  **Practical Mind Training for Worry:**
    *   **Ground in the Present:** Acknowledge current security (e.g., "for the next 30 days, you're good").
    *   **Compartmentalize:** Consciously set worry aside with a phrase like, "Let me worry about that later." This allows the mind to be at ease in the present.
    *   **Reframe Security:** Instead of seeking open-ended security (which is impossible), aim for manageable, short-term security (e.g., "3 months in advance").

3.  **The Fundamental Shift: From "What" to "Who":**
    *   Dhammarato introduces a key paradigm shift: true security comes not from **what you know** (professional skills, client list) but from **who you know** (genuine friendships and community).
    *   He advises the practitioner to stop seeing his work as "building a clientele" and start seeing it as **"making friends."** By becoming "the most friendly trainer," he will naturally attract loyalty and referrals without forced self-promotion.

4.  **Cultural Illustration (Thailand):**
    *   Dhammarato uses Thai culture as an example of this "who you know" principle. He describes it as a laid-back culture where family and social networks provide a deep sense of security, reducing anxiety over jobs or money. Money within this framework is "family money," strengthening bonds rather than threatening them.

5.  **Application to Work:**
    *   The practitioner realizes he has been overly "professional" and distant. Dhammarato gives "full permission" to shift to being a **"friendly professional."**
    *   The new approach: Go to the gym to "make friends and hang out." This transforms work from a chore into a source of joy and connection, which will organically sustain the business.

### **Key Takeaways**
*   **Fear is a mind-state to be managed,** not a direct reflection of reality. Use mindfulness to put it down.
*   **Genuine relationship-building is a core Dhamma practice** that leads to worldly and spiritual security.
*   **Align your livelihood with your practice** by infusing it with metta (loving-kindness) and friendship.
*   The goal is to create a life where work feels like "having fun with people" rather than forced effort.

The session concludes with both feeling inspired, resolving to go out and "make more friends," turning the insight into immediate practice.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary **metaphor** and **story** used are:

**1. The "Safety Net" or "Security" Metaphor (as Friends/Family):**
   *   Speaker B reframes financial and career security not as a function of money or client lists, but as a **network of friends**. He contrasts the Western mindset ("what you know") with the Thai mindset ("who you know").
   *   The story of **Thai culture** serves as an extended analogy. He describes how Thais are "laid back" because their security comes from deep family and social networks, not just jobs. Money within this system is "family money" that cements bonds rather than something that can destroy friendships.
   *   The advice is to **build a "family" of friends** at work. This network then becomes the real safety net, as friends will naturally recommend you or help you if needed, making aggressive client-seeking unnecessary.

**2. The "Container" or "Time Box" Metaphor for Worry:**
   *   To manage anxiety about the future, Speaker B suggests mentally **containing the worry to a limited timeframe** (e.g., 1 month or 3 months). The instruction is: *"Let me worry about that later... I can set that worry down and not have to pick it back up for a month."* This turns an open-ended, overwhelming fear into a manageable, time-bound concern.

**3. The "Rock Bottom" vs. "Sailing" Metaphor:**
   *   Speaker B assesses Speaker A's situation by saying, *"you're nowhere near rock bottom. In fact, you're sailing right now."* This creates a spectrum where "rock bottom" is a crisis point requiring drastic intervention, and "sailing" is a state of manageable motion. It's used to reassure Speaker A that their fear is anticipatory, not based on a current emergency.

**4. The "Straddling Two Cultures / Worlds" Metaphor:**
   *   Speaker B references the saying, *"East is East and West is West, and never the twain shall meet,"* but then counters it with his personal story of learning to **"straddle the two cultures."** This metaphor illustrates the mindset shift required—moving from a transactional, professional identity to a relational, friendly one. He credits his time at the Wat (temple) for giving him this perspective.

**5. The "Professional" vs. "Friendly Professional" Story:**
   *   Speaker A tells a brief personal story about how he started his business wanting to be "serious and professional," which meant keeping a distance from clients. Speaker B reframes this, saying he now has **"full permission"** to shift his story from being just a "professional" to being a **"friendly professional."** The underlying story changes from "distance ensures respect" to "friendship ensures loyalty and security."

**In summary:** The core metaphorical framework is that **true security is a web of friendships, not a stack of money or clients.** This is supported by the illustrative story of Thai social structures and the personal story of transforming one's professional identity. Smaller metaphors like "sailing," "rock bottom," and "straddling cultures" help clarify the emotional and cultural landscape of the discussion.
