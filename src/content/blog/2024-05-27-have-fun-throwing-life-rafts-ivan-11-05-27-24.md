### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Yes, it will get better when you remember to see the worry as worry.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Then you can say, "Oh, I don't have to worry." At least stop worry and think of Dharma, think about being happy.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, when you're thinking about the Dhamma, then that's a wholesome thought. If you're worried about the Dharma, then that's an unwholesome thought.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And so if you can see that worrying, even worrying about the Dharma, is an unwholesome thought, we can change it and say, wow, the Dharma is great. Wow, I remember what Dhammarato said. Wow, I can reflect about how much joy it gives. So you start thinking about the Dharma, start remembering the teachings that I've given you, start teaching it to yourself. That in fact, repeating favorite phrases over and over and over again, just like the monks chant, repeating those phrases over and over again, everything's going to be all right, no place to go and nothing to do, and everything's going to be okay. You keep repeating those phrases, that's Dhamma. But if you keep thinking thoughts like, oh, am I getting it right? Oh, my feelings are not as great as I want them to be, then those are unwholesome thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And remember that the first thing that you said, you started this whole conversation out, is about 'I'm worried about,' and I cut you off right then. I don't even care what it is that you're worried about. The fact is that I can see you worried, and you use the word and can't see that you're worried.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** It takes a worried man to sing a worried song. Have you heard that before? Takes a worried man to sing a worried song. And here you are singing a worried song. But you could fix that up by saying, yeah, but I ain't going to be worried long. Put a stop to that. You're worried now, but you can stop it. You ain't going to be worried long. Um, you remember to look to see that you're worried. We've talked about this before, and you come back with a new worry. Doesn't matter what the worry is. The fact is, can you stop it and just have happy, wholesome thoughts?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think it's just the choice of words I use to facilitate.

**Speaker A:** I hear all of this. I hear your choice of words.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's just— The question is, can.

**Speaker A:** You hear your choice of words instead of trying to make even choicier words to get your point across? Can you see that those choicey words you're using are unwholesome? And then you can change it.

**Speaker B:** It's almost— it's almost like there's certain words I use. To make sure I come across as polite. But I mean, there are certain words I use to make sure I come across as polite. That's what I was saying.

**Speaker A:** You don't have to be polite with me. I'm not polite with you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Actually, that's kind of the question I've been wanting to ask, which is, sometimes there's a Sangha on Discord. Well, there's one where DJ and Michael was in, which is your server, Dhammarato. And then there was another Sangha, which Well, long story short, sometimes I feel like helping people, maybe really just out of generosity, and I will say something and then people find it dismissive. As in, actually, my question is just, I feel like that me wanting to help people sometimes is just not wholesome because the interaction will just turn out unwholesome, and I feel like, I feel like an idiot trying to help people.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Okay, let's talk about that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, here's— first of all, you can't help anyone.

**Speaker B:** I agree.

**Speaker A:** So can you— now that you agree, can you cheer up about it? Can you cheer up to where you know you can't help anyone?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Only people like you found out that you can only— are the only one who can help yourself. Can you recognize that you can't help anyone? That guy that you're trying to help, the only one that can help him is himself.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Yes. Okay.

**Speaker A:** The second point is, is that in our culture Even in Malaysian culture, the word help is a positive word, and a better way of looking at it is, oh, it's not so positive because it's often rejected. Your help is going to be rejected because it's negative anyway.

**Speaker B:** I agree.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so don't try to help anybody, but you can share your joy. Yes, that may piss some people off because they don't want to be joyful. Yes, and, and we know that they don't want to be joyful because you've already gotten yourself into the vision of you want to help them. Help them? Why do you want to help them? I agree. Why do you want to help them though? Is because they're not joyful. Is that right? They're in the misery and you want to help them out of misery.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Jumping into their misery pool with them is not going to help them. That's going to piss them off.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And standing on the ship and laughing at them without jumping in to help them is going to piss them off.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** All right, so what's the right thing to do? Well, the analogy is to throw them a life buoy that's got a lifeline or a rope, so that you hold one end of the rope and throw them a life buoy. And when they grab a hold of it, then and only after they pull— grab a hold of it— can you start to pull them in. You can throw them a life buoy and they'll get pissed off at that too. So there's no reason to pull that in unless they've already grabbed hold of it and they want it.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so often when you throw them a joyful life buoy, they, they mistakenly think that you're still on the boat which you are, and just laughing at them rather than throwing them a lifeline. Yes, but it's only up— always up to them as to whether they see what you're doing as useful, valuable, and wholesome to them or not in their own context. And so this is where the wisdom comes in. The wisdom is, is that sometimes, in fact One of the things that I find quite often is that somebody comes wanting to argue with me. Or I'll make a statement and they don't understand it. So instead of saying, please clarify, they'll start arguing with me about it.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that's what happened.

**Speaker A:** An example of that would be, what about the gradual method? And my first statement will be: the gradual method is for losers. And one will stay a gradual progressor, and as long as they're progressing slowly, they're still a loser. I mean, isn't that clear and obvious?

**Speaker B:** Okay, all right.

**Speaker A:** But they'll argue about, oh well, there is the slow approach. And the answer to that is, is that when you change your mind about can you do it now rather than postponing and staying in your misery, making progress in your misery, and start being happy right now.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So that's where you have to come to, is to get them to believe that it's okay for them to be happy right now. It's okay for them to take that life preserver, and then you're going to just pull them right in and cheer them right up. Right here, right now. Yes, within the next 10 to 20 seconds you can cheer them up if they're willing to be cheered up, just like you are. You're willing to be cheered up, and that's why I can throw you that lifeline. Do you know that you were worried when you first called, and here you are just howling with laughter?

**Speaker B:** I mean, yeah, it's really funny. It's hard not to laugh.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so this is the approach. When you get yourself back into howling with laughter Only then can you actually help them.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** So there's where the wisdom comes in, is that, yeah, you can throw them the life raft, but they may refuse it. But you keep talking, you keep throwing the life raft, and then when they grab hold of it, finally now you can pull them in. But commonly what happens is that people jump in with them. They go right into the misery.

**Speaker B:** Yes. And then I will feel misery too once I jump in.

**Speaker A:** So you recognize you can't help anybody. The only way— and the help that they need to give themselves is to grab hold of that life raft. If they don't grab hold of it, they don't take the active action to grab something, a hold of it that you're willing to give them, then there's no way that you can pull them in.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I really got me thinking about how Buddha helped people. Is it fair to say you don't spend much time arguing?

**Speaker A:** It's fair to say I do not spend much time arguing. And in fact, more recently, I would say that I am downright rude in their opinion because I won't argue with them. Yeah, like for instance, somebody will say, I'm— well, I'm making a point here. And the answer to that is, I'm not interested in your points. And then you'll rephrase it to the— to saying something like, uh, oh, well, I'm trying to ask a question. And so my answer to that would be, well, ask the question and stop trying to make points with me. Yes, you're not going to get any points done, but if you got a question, you can make a— you can ask a question.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** All right, so this is how you begin to deal with people, is by not putting up with their wanting to argue and tell you that your life raft or life buoy is not good enough yet. I agree.

**Speaker B:** It's— yeah, it kind of reminds me of— I mean, I don't read enough sutra, but it seems like Buddha himself often is quite direct with what he's trying to say.

**Speaker A:** I mean, he was quite direct.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And he was also good at not letting people argue with him.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But in fact what he would do instead is say something that shocked them. Some of the stuff he said was really shocking. You want to give a couple of examples of that?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. There in India, in the time of the Buddha, and still in certain pockets of India, mostly practiced by a group of people who were very close to the Jain system, will practice really strange austerities.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay. One would be the cow the cow duty aesthetic, which means that he lives in a— that you could even have a pig duty aesthetic. I don't think that they have those, but the way of a cow duty aesthetic is to go live with the cows, walk around in the cow pen which has got cow dung. Yes, moo like a cow, eat with the cows. And the one that's even more weird is the Dog Duty aesthetic, which means that they walk mostly crawling around on all fours. They eat food only off the ground, or only out of a plate if the plate's on the ground.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And both of the Cow Duty aesthetic and the Dog Duty aesthetic are generally walking around naked in public. Which is allowed in India because they've been doing it for centuries, dozens of centuries, millennia even. Okay. And so the dog-duty aesthetic goes to the Buddha and asks a question about it. And the Buddha was very, very, very direct in the sense that he says is that if you continue doing the dog-duty aesthetic and you are successful, you will become a dog.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Or in their way of talking about it, you will be reborn as a dog. And if you fail at being a dog, practicing the dog duty aesthetic, then you will wind up in hell. Those are your two choices, is to become a dog or to go to hell. And they said the same thing to the cow duty ascetic. And so when that happened, one of them started bawling, one started crying. He couldn't stand the fact that the Buddha was right, that yeah, he's dooming himself to either becoming a dog or he's going to go to hell. And so he was ready to hear the Dhamma. And this is when the Buddha actually gives his disposition about Kamma. Why? Because that's what the dog duty aesthetic is really all about. He's trying to pretend to be something that he is not in order to do the austerity, in order to burn off all of the old bad Kamma. Because that's why people do those crazy things. They're trying to improve themselves. They're trying to get out of the predicament that Kamma has put them into. So they're trying to burn off old bad karma, and what they're doing instead is creating new bad karma.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Yes. So if that's the case, then we can begin to see that there are more than just two kinds of Kamma. There is the Kamma that is good, that gives good results. That's why people are generous. That's why they're kind-hearted. That's why they give to the church. That's why they do altruistic things. And then there is bad action that gives bad results. And that's what most people are taught to do. Work too hard, steal money, lie, cheat, all of that kind of stuff. But I tell you, there is more. There is also, in fact, the most common action of all has both dark and bright results. So therefore, the action itself is both dark and bright.

**Speaker B:** I see.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And we have that commonly in our society, like the cloud has a silver lining. Or things weren't so bad after all, that things were mixed, that doctors in fact practice medicine with mixed motivations. Oh yeah, the practice of medicine is done with mixed motivations. And people will say, oh, well, the doctors are really good people because they're trying to help people. And the answer to that is often the doctors will give medicine to somebody knowing that it's a placebo. He's not trying to cure the person because he has no cure. He's trying to get the person to cure themselves by lying to them, giving them a pill. Maybe they believe in it. They also— doctors have a mixed Kamma in the sense that they often charge too much. They pay too little attention and charge too much money and give no value.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And so the practice of medicine is a mixed bag, and that's exactly what you're doing when you're trying to help people. You've got mixed motives. You think that in fact you'll feel better if you can get that guy to feel better, and you can't make him feel better, so you wind up feeling bad yourself.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's also less about me not able to help, it's more that they perceive my intention as something else, which— but yeah, basically what you said earlier on, as in, yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** But yeah, it is a mixed bag.

**Speaker A:** Yes. So almost all action is mixed, mixed, comma. Doctors don't practice medicine purely altruistically. Even altruistic organizations do not practice altruistically. In fact, what happens is— and I'll give you a good example of the Red Cross. You've heard of the Red Cross, obviously. It's in You have it also, the Red Crescent. Both of them are in Malaysia. Okay, the Red Cross spends 80% of their income advertising and paying salaries, and only 20% of their income goes to doing the original good work that they were doing. So they've got a mixed bag of about 80/20.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** 80% selfish and only 20% altruistic. Why is that? Because the people who work for the Red Cross, it's more important for them for the Red Cross to survive than it is for the Red Cross to do its job. If the Red Cross was only intended to do its job, it would waste all its resources in doing its job and it wouldn't survive. Yes, the bureaucracy wouldn't get paid, they'd quit and go someplace else. And so we put up with the Red Cross because at least 20% of the money they take in does something of value. Okay, so now that you understand that almost everything is done in a mixed bag That's what was happening to the dog duty aesthetic, that in fact he thought he was doing good where in fact he was not. He was doing himself harm. All right, so now that we understand that, let's talk about a fourth kind of Kamma. Yes, and the fourth kind of Kamma according to the Buddha— and by the way, all of this that I'm talking to you about is in a sutta, number 57, in the Majjhana Nikaya. And it's called The Dog Duty Aesthetic. Okay, so you can go read this sutta if you want.

**Speaker B:** Yes, 57.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh, number 57, The Dog Duty Aesthetic. So let's talk about the real point, because that real point really applies to you.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, the fourth kind of Kamma is neither bright nor dark and gives results that neither bright nor dark, but it does lead to the end of action. It does lead to the end of Kamma, and in fact it also does lead to nothing, which is liberation.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose. And so when your actions become just actions, They're not bright, they're not dark, and the results are not bright and not dark. So let's figure out what that means, okay? If they're not dark, that means that the things that you're doing is not harming anyone. Yes, they may harm themselves, but you're not harming anyone. You're throwing that life crap out there. But if ordinary person throws that life raft out there and somebody doesn't grab onto it, they're going to feel bad. Oh, I threw you a life preserver and you didn't even take it. Yes, but if you can in fact talk to people without expecting any results from them at all— yes. Without expecting any results at all, that your actions are just merely actions and they don't have any consequences, um, for you to judge as good or bad. Whatever consequences are just consequences without you judging it, okay? Which means then that you're not harming people, so it's, it's not dark. And because you're not doing things to harm people, the harm that they get is not your action, it's their own. Yes, but also you threw that life trap without expecting anything. Okay, so your good actions are neither good anymore, they're just actions now. You see, all that's what I'm going to do, I'm going to throw that guy a life trap. And if he takes it, that's okay. And if he doesn't take it, that's okay. Yes, but the whole point about Kamma is always later. It's past and future oriented. So if you throw a life raft to this guy and he takes it right now, you can enjoy the benefit of it right now without having any future issues. The whole point, like, for that would be, oh, I'm in heaven now and God is judging me, and I say, well, I threw that guy a life raft, right? So we expect to have more than just whether he took it or not. He didn't take it, but at least I did something good, right? And guess what? You may not get any results at all. So begin to do some things then without expression, expectations of the outcomes. And this is especially true when you're trying to help someone, because if you can help them, you will feel good and they will too. But if you can't help them, then you will feel bad and so will they. Can you go and do what you're going to do without expectations of whether you're helping or not?

**Speaker B:** I just want to understand a bit better. So, like usually it's like if someone is saying something and I feel it's nice to contribute my point of view. Really, I wasn't really expecting whether they get better or not, it's just, I just want to say it. And then someone just suddenly out of nowhere, they come and argue with me even though I wasn't asking for any argument. How should I react? Should I just let it be and ignore them?

**Speaker A:** No, you can tell them, I'm not Arya, I'm not interested in arguing. Yes, and you could do it cheerfully. Maintain your cheerfulness even when they're not taking your life raft. Your joy is up to you, not up to your actions and the results of your actions. Your joy is up to you. And so you go do what you're going to do without expecting any results.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Now the thing that is really amazing is, is that over time, if you still keep dealing with these guys, and if you know them, you'll— they'll be around. You keep throwing them life grabs, eventually they're going to grab hold of it.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** But that's still up to them. Yes, it's not up to you. So in a way, you're saying you're— the question you have is, is that, oh, I want to help people, how can I do that? And my answer is, forget it! You can't help anybody, but you can maintain your own joy, you can maintain your cheerfulness, you can be downright happily rude, because that shocks them and wakes them up. What is this thing? Is this a life raft or what? How dare you throw things at me when I want you to come in and join my pity party?

**Speaker B:** It really feels that way, like they just want to— when you do job inside with them, it's weird.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's the way that the Buddha handles it. He's going to shock them, he's going to throw them something, and they say, what the heck is this? And I have seen time after time after time, not 100% of the time, but time after time, I'll hit somebody hard with something and they stop arguing with me and start listening. And that all happens within an hour. I'll let them go for 20 minutes or so, and then I'll start hitting them. So you could do that too. You don't have an hour, maybe you've got several days over, you know, bits and pieces of course of time, but don't expect any results, but have fun throwing life rafts. Have fun throwing life preservers.

**Speaker B:** Just that imaginary, like, makes me laugh. Like, I'm just trying. I'm just throwing lifeboat and I'm just having fun here.

**Speaker A:** Just— yeah, I'm just having fun. I don't care whether you get any saving or not. I don't care whether you drown in your own misery. I'm just having fun here.

**Speaker B:** It makes so much sense. I've been reflecting on some of how Buddha himself helped people. It really feels like there's this air of like, he's just in his own joyfulness. Like, even though he's helping, it's not like, going down there with them. It's really amazing. Thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Good to see you again, Ivan. We'll see you this weekend too.

**Speaker B:** Okay, see you. Thank you, Dharma.

**Speaker A:** You go have fun, don't try to help them, just have fun throwing life rafts.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I will.

**Speaker A:** All right, we'll see you. Bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, the core teaching from Dhammarato is about **transforming unwholesome mental habits—especially worry and the misguided desire to "help" others—into joyful, present-moment awareness.**

Here is a structured summary of the key points:

### **Core Problem: Identification with Worry**
*   The student begins by expressing worry. Dhammarato immediately reframes the issue: the *content* of the worry is irrelevant; the problem is the state of *worrying itself*.
*   Worry is an **unwholesome thought**, even if it's about Dhamma practice. The solution is to recognize the worry, stop it, and deliberately choose a wholesome, joyful thought.

### **The Method: Cultivating Wholesome Thoughts**
*   Actively replace worrying thoughts with joyful Dhamma reflections.
*   Use repetitive, uplifting phrases (like "everything's going to be all right") as a form of mental chanting to anchor the mind in positivity.

### **The Central Dilemma: The Desire to "Help"**
*   The student feels frustrated because his attempts to help others in online Sanghas often lead to arguments and feelings of inadequacy.
*   **Dhammarato's radical reframe: "You can't help anyone."**
    *   The only person anyone can truly help is themselves.
    *   The conventional idea of "helping" is often a **mixed-action** (kamma)—motivated partly by a desire to feel better oneself or to fix another's misery.

### **The Correct Approach: "Throwing a Life Raft"**
*   Don't jump into the "misery pool" with someone. This drags you down and doesn't rescue them.
*   Instead, **maintain your own joy and cheerfulness**. From that stable, joyful place, you can "throw a life raft"—offer Dhamma insight, a shocking truth, or a joyful perspective.
*   **Wisdom lies in understanding:** It is entirely up to the other person to **grab the life raft**. If they argue or reject it, that's their choice. Your job is not to convince them but to maintain your joy and keep the raft available.
*   This approach is **without expectation**. You act because it's joyful to share, not because you need a specific result (their improvement).

### **Supporting Wisdom from the Buddha**
*   Dhammarato references the **Dog-duty Ascetic Sutta (MN 57)**, where the Buddha shocks an ascetic by telling him his extreme practices will only lead to a bad rebirth. This direct, "rude" shock was an act of compassion meant to break the person's delusion.
*   The sutta explains the **four kinds of kamma**:
    1.  Dark (unwholesome) with dark results.
    2.  Bright (wholesome) with bright results.
    3.  **Mixed** (most common, like trying to "help" with mixed motives).
    4.  **Neither dark nor bright**: The kamma that leads to the end of kamma. This is the ideal—acting from a place of no expectation, where your actions are just actions, free from the craving for a particular outcome.

### **Practical Advice**
*   **Be direct, even "rudely" cheerful.** Don't engage in arguments. If someone wants to argue, politely but firmly decline: "I'm not interested in arguing."
*   Your primary duty is to **cultivate and protect your own joy**. From that foundation, whatever you share will be genuinely beneficial.
*   **Have fun** with the process. See interactions as opportunities to playfully "throw life rafts," not as burdensome projects to "fix" people.

### **Conclusion**
The talk's essence is a shift from **externally-focused fixing** (which leads to worry and mixed kamma) to **internally-focused joyful abiding** (which leads to pure, effective action). True "help" is an overflow of your own well-being, offered freely without attachment to the result. The path is to stop worrying, choose joy now, and from that place, engage the world with playful, compassionate detachment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary metaphors and stories used are:

**1. The "Worried Song" Metaphor:**
   *   **Quote:** "It takes a worried man to sing a worried song... And here you are singing a worried song. But you could fix that up by saying, yeah, but I ain't going to be worried long."
   *   **Purpose:** To illustrate that worry is a self-perpetuating state of mind (singing the song) that one can choose to stop (deciding not to sing it long).

**2. The "Life Buoy / Life Raft" Metaphor (Extended Analogy):**
   This is the central, most developed metaphor in the talk.
   *   **The Scenario:** A person drowning in misery (or worry) is in the water. The helper is on a ship.
   *   **Wrong Approach 1:** Jumping into the misery pool with them. (Result: You both get miserable, and it "pisses them off.")
   *   **Wrong Approach 2:** Standing on the ship and laughing at them. (Result: It "pisses them off.")
   *   **Right Approach:** Throwing them a life buoy with a rope. You can only pull them in **after** they actively grab hold of it. Even throwing it may annoy them, and you cannot force them to take it.
   *   **Purpose:** To teach that genuine help (sharing joy/Dharma) is offering a way out, but the other person must actively accept it. You cannot "help" by joining their misery or by forcing salvation. Your role is to joyfully offer the lifeline without attachment to the outcome.

**3. The Story of the Buddha and the Dog-Duty Ascetic:**
   *   **The Story:** An ascetic who lived like a dog (crawling, eating from the ground) asked the Buddha about his practice. The Buddha shockingly stated that if successful, he'd be reborn as a dog, and if unsuccessful, he'd go to hell.
   *   **Purpose:** To demonstrate the Buddha's direct, "shocking" method to break through wrong views. The story leads into the teaching on the four kinds of **Kamma (Action)**, moving from good, bad, and mixed actions to the fourth kind: action that leads to the end of action (neither bright nor dark).

**4. The "Mixed Bag" / "Mixed Kamma" Analogy:**
   *   **Examples:** A cloud with a silver lining, doctors practicing with mixed motives (to heal and to make money), and the **Red Cross** spending 80% on overhead/salaries and 20% on actual aid.
   *   **Purpose:** To explain that most worldly action, including the initial desire to "help," comes from mixed motives (e.g., wanting to feel good by making others feel good). This sets up the need to move toward the fourth kind of Kamma—acting without expectation.

**5. The "Gradual Method is for Losers" Provocation:**
   *   **Quote:** "the gradual method is for losers... as long as they're progressing slowly, they're still a loser."
   *   **Purpose:** Used as an example of a "shocking" or "rude" statement meant to jolt someone out of complacency and the idea that happiness must be postponed. It's a rhetorical tactic to provoke a shift in perspective.

**Summary:** The talk uses the **"Life Buoy"** metaphor as its core framework for understanding helpful vs. unhelpful interaction. The **story of the Dog-Duty Ascetic** provides a scriptural example of the direct, shocking teaching style that embodies this framework. The **"Worried Song"** and **"Mixed Bag"** analogies support the core lessons about internal mental state and motivation. The overall narrative moves from dealing with one's own worry to understanding how to interact with others without being pulled into their misery or becoming attached to outcomes.
