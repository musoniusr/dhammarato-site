### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Yes, so we've been actually talking about the cycles that happen in the mind that the Buddha refers to as Samsara, that many people think of as magical. In fact, the cycle can actually be understood to be the cycle of thought giving rise to more thoughts, which also give rise to feelings. Those feelings give rise to thoughts, and now we've got a full cycle going. But there's another cycle which is actually quite wholesome that we can point to, and that is that with right Sati and with one's right view and one's right effort, those three things cycle together, to wit, that one's right effort now becomes to improve our view. Our effort becomes to improve the view, and that's basically what you begin to do, is that the improvement of the view is actually by adding some discernment in there. Let's start looking at what's going on rather than just assume, like everybody does, assumes that, well, it's my thought, I mean, it must be okay with me.

**Speaker B:** But then a lot of people's thoughts that they have not helpful, not okay.

**Speaker A:** They can quite easily be recognized that so many of the thoughts that we have been trained to think are actually very unwholesome for us, and some of them create anxiety needlessly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And then the anxiety creates planning needlessly.

**Speaker B:** Time and energy that could be spent on much more productive and wholesome things.

**Speaker A:** Like not putting any time and energy into anything anymore.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Then we begin to use the time wisely because we recognize that time actually is relative based upon how it's loaded. And if we unload it completely, there's nothing left. But right now, that's all we've ever had.

**Speaker B:** And by the way, yeah, that's very true. All we've ever had is the present, right?

**Speaker A:** Tomorrow really does not ever come, and what we thought was tomorrow winds up being today anyway.

**Speaker B:** Yes, very true.

**Speaker A:** So, in that regard, here's a story that we could tell, and that is the story about the old man in a hovel so many centuries, thousands of years ago, and he's laying there in his hovel at night, maybe with a candle or a lamp or something, and it goes out, and he's laying there with just so much anxiety, and he's worried, not really about anything other than the anxiety in the sense of, "What's going on? Why?" In other words, it's almost like for many people, anxiety is like a messenger from the gods telling you, danger, danger, danger, danger, danger, danger.

**Speaker B:** Something's going wrong. Oh, you need to worry.

**Speaker A:** So we have to kind of figure out, well, what is it that's gone wrong? What do we need to fix? And so he settles upon, oh, I know what it is. The fence needs mending. If I don't go fix it right now, the wolves will get in or the goats will get out. He hops up out of his hovel, goes and spends hours finding stones, putting them in the wall, making sure that it's really good. This is at night. This is a long time ago. He didn't have the kind of torches that they have nowadays. He goes back exhausted in the middle of the night and lays back down. Feeling pretty good for the first minute, and then the anxiety comes back again. And here he has spent all that time fixing that wall, thinking that by fixing the wall he was getting rid of the anxiety, where in fact what he was doing was he was just occupying his mind doing a task and not paying attention to the fact that he was still having a lot of anxiety inside because he wasn't watching his mind closely enough to recognize, for instance, that while he's building the wall, he's having thoughts of wolves jumping over it, or sheep jumping out, or things like that, so that he's terrifying himself while he's actually building a very secure wall. Where's his joy about, "Look what a nice wall I built," and take a deep breath and a sigh of relief, and actually feel that relief? No, he still has that anxiety. Well, modern-day is even more sophisticated and complicated than that. Because we have very complicated lives. All he had was just a hovel and a fence and a few goats.

**Speaker B:** Very simple in comparison. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. And so we live our lives jumping or hopping from one unsatisfying thought to another. This is in fact the basis of the monkey mind. Why? Would the monkey mind jump?

**Speaker B:** Why would the monkey mind jump? It's a monkey mind, it's a wild monkey, it's unpredictable.

**Speaker A:** We're calling it that because of this wild unpredictable behavior. So what is the source of the jumping?

**Speaker B:** The source of the jumping?

**Speaker A:** If you were sitting on a limb in a tree, all of a sudden you jumped. Why would you jump?

**Speaker B:** You're scared or something. Yes, you jump because you're scared. You want to get away from that.

**Speaker A:** Here we are jumpy because we frighten ourselves sometimes with our own shadows that appear when we're jumping.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think our shadow is much scarier than what it is. It's not a jaguar, it's just— we're

**Speaker A:** not taking a really good look at

**Speaker B:** what the shadow actually is.

**Speaker A:** Of the monkey jumps from here to here, why did it jump from here? The answer is because there was something unsatisfying about where the monkey had landed at that particular moment, which may have been upon Grandma. And then we jump, and then it

**Speaker B:** might land, it might land somewhere else unsatisfying. So it keeps jumping and it keeps

**Speaker A:** on jumping and jumping and jumping because the source of it is that the mind is in fact dissatisfied.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So if we go back then to the Buddhist premises, is that if we have wholesome thoughts, then the mind is less likely to be jumpy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think, I think a lot of people make— what am I trying to say here— they mix up occupying the mind with actually being present and being wholesome. A lot of people like to fill the space or fill the silence with just something to occupy the mind, and they, and they think that that is helpful or helping, and maybe it does to some degree, but not as much as actually applying right view.

**Speaker A:** It really is a— you could go so far as to call it a placebo.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that's a good way to describe it.

**Speaker A:** And that people feel a whole lot better by watching YouTube than they do about sitting in front of a turd-off PC thinking about all their troubles. Yeah, it gives— it gives the mind— most likely, right? Which one is most likely to produce anxiety? Watching the YouTube, which is possible, or sitting there worrying about all your worries and cares of the world? That's pretty good right there.

**Speaker B:** Okay,

**Speaker A:** that's— that's gonna come across because it's an escape. We know it's an escape, but people are then not willing to actually look at it and escape from What?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they don't, they don't look inside. They don't realize what they're trying to escape from. And so you just remain in that state of wanting to escape but not knowing what to escape from or how to escape from it, because you're not applying right Sati, you're not applying right view, you're not seeing where the mind is going throughout the day, and you're not realizing that ain't good, I'm not going there. So whatever.

**Speaker A:** So even though the mind thinks that it has free association, wherever it jumps to, there it finds dissatisfaction over and over again until we find out that this, though it may be vast, this is still a prison. I never do really find the freedom. And the reason they don't have the freedom is they don't recognize that they can be free by having freeing thoughts. And that they have dissatisfactions when they have unsatisfying thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that's something that I would definitely do, like during university. Maybe I wouldn't be in front of YouTube, but I mean, I had work to do, it was university, but the work would sort of serve as an occupation for the mind, and I wouldn't actually think to myself about, oh, where has the mind gone, and is this constructive or helpful? You know, 9 times out of 10 it would have been no, not helpful in the slightest. But I was just so focused on occupying space, like you say, doing work, revision, watching YouTube, that sort of stuff. So Yeah, time that could have been spent a little bit more constructively.

**Speaker A:** Or you could have just saved it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so could have done that. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** That we could have been— actually, we could have taken the complete benefit of that time. Yeah, in the sense of just sitting and enjoying it. This moment. Yeah, we don't let ourselves do that. And when we do, because of the few past moments that we've had, we wind up having anxiety and, and, and whatnot like that. Uh, it really is, um, uh, kind of an interesting thing when students will say that, you know, I've tried your technique, but

**Speaker B:** Bhikkhuni.

**Speaker A:** Even when I tell myself to cheer up and find joy, it's artificial. It's not real. I don't really feel joyful.

**Speaker B:** Okay, and then what do you say to them?

**Speaker A:** Ah, well, that judgment is just merely a judgment. Okay, that you're judging that your joy, that whatever it is that you have, is still not good enough. And so that's the hindrance, is to having those kind of thoughts that this is not joy, it's artificial, it's not good enough. Those are part of the hindrances. It's not ever enough. Where wholesome thoughts are going to be the kind of thoughts of, yeah, this is good enough right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, people hold their expectations possibly a bit too high. While I've been applying right Sati, right view, right effort, I'm not overcome with absolute euphoria. Oh my God, this is the best feeling in the world. No, but I'm satisfied.

**Speaker A:** Well, you ain't seen nothing yet.

**Speaker B:** I'm sure I will get there soon

**Speaker A:** No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I just pulled my favorite Buddhist joke on you. Hahaha. What I mean is, I mean it literally. You ain't seen nothing. Ah, and those who want the euphoria want that because they don't want— they don't want to know that, hey man, nothing's better than that. I think we did some air quotes in there someplace.

**Speaker B:** Oh goodness.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right. Relaxation is really— we don't need the euphoria, but it comes kind of on its own in the sense that— well, let us talk about it in this regard. Let's talk about it of being alive, being vibrantly alive, having life force that's up to about this kind of level. But then the turmoils of life are up here with all of the hindrances and all of the problems and all the anxieties and all of the worries. But when you begin to settle that down, that looks like euphoria. And boy, does it feel that way too, being vibrantly alive. And wow, I feel so good.

**Speaker B:** That's a good way to look at it,

**Speaker A:** that, that is there, but it too will begin to subside until there's really not much left. Nothing much, nothing much,

**Speaker B:** nothing much. A lot more subtle.

**Speaker A:** And so this is the way of looking at it. Yeah, the euphoria is going to be there But the euphoria that we're talking about has been there all along anyway. We just had too much trouble to worry about it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's just about removing those troubles and letting it— and you

**Speaker A:** find out, wow, what a beautiful day this is. Things are really, really nice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. I mean,

**Speaker A:** I, I've still— I don't

**Speaker B:** know, I've just been more aware as I've been walking around and just looking at things like the shapes of trees.

**Speaker A:** That's what eyes are for,

**Speaker B:** and we

**Speaker A:** wouldn't stumble into so much stuff if we'd use them.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's very true, very, very true. But yeah, just just more aware of what I see instead of walking around and thinking about this and thinking about that. You know, I've got a direction in mind, my legs are moving automatically, but am I aware of what's going on? No. Everything's up here. But recently, as I've been walking around—

**Speaker A:** in a way, it's almost a marvel to see how complex the human being is with all of his fallacies and frailties. It's a pretty complex machine. Not only can we walk and chew gum at same time, we can completely ignore those two tasks and be off in Neverland.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's very true.

**Speaker A:** We don't even have to be here to watch what's going on. We can just forget the whole show,

**Speaker B:** forget the whole thing, and just be—

**Speaker A:** yeah, we got our own private hell to go to, you know.

**Speaker B:** Wow, it's crazy how much people actually spend up there, how long they do, and for how long they don't even realize that they do.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's what the whole awakening really is all about. This is what it's all about. Congratulations again, you're waking up.

**Speaker B:** It's a good feeling. It's very, very nice.

**Speaker A:** So you stay with that wholesome, that's recognize it. And so, um, a really good thing that, uh, has a quality with, with, um, the teachings of the Buddha that's very useful that I use sometimes, one is, is that It's not my business, as a quotation.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Not my business. The other one, which I was just thinking about, is that forget about it.

**Speaker B:** Forget about it.

**Speaker A:** Just forget about it, even though that whole phrase comes out of the mob, out of the mafia.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Forget about it. Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay. That's also very Buddhist. That's the right way to think of it, is just forget about it. Uh, if you were able to do that with whatever it brings up anxiety and you just forgot about it, then where's going to be anxiety come from?

**Speaker B:** Oh, it's not going to come from anywhere. Is it going to be so nice?

**Speaker A:** Okay, so we recognize that our thoughts guide our feelings, but then the feelings, once we work them up, now they guide the thoughts. Yeah, so that someone can be so full of anxiety that they're almost dancing without music. Agitated.

**Speaker B:** Very agitated. Yeah, yeah. But yeah, it is, it is a spiral.

**Speaker A:** And then the mind just starts all over the place because the whole system's got all the adrenaline in it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** No place to go, no water to burn it off, right? But in fact, fight or flight, the best thing to do in that regard would be to take a hike, to go walking.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So let that stuff kind of drain out, if we can remember that though, this is the reason I'm walking, is to clear this stuff out of the system.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Including all the thoughts that I had that worked me up into it. Yeah, but here you are getting a bit better than that. You're beginning to see that stuff now before it even works you up, that you can see it when it comes, and you can see it as danger, danger, anxiety 10 seconds ahead. Yeah, don't go down that path.

**Speaker B:** Slam on the brakes, put the car in reverse, let's get out of here,

**Speaker A:** let's get that thought out of here. And it takes a whole lot less time than even the analogy of backing up the car. It's Yeah, it's much more like the way that Bugs Bunny or the Road Runner would do it, with an occasional beep beep all along the way.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Oh, good shows, good shows. But yeah, I'm starting to have these clearer realizations, and just having them is very— what's the word I'm looking for here— like, it, I suppose, like, it fills me with more confidence. It adds to the confidence. It really does. Which is— which I personally find, for me, is a big component of it, having that confidence and knowing that your abilities are good enough, or they're getting better enable to deal with them. Just having that additional confidence is so, so helpful. It really is.

**Speaker A:** Congratulations for building that too. That's also on that list, though, that completes the item there. In fact, that when we have right view, right Sati, right effort working correctly, it builds up that confidence. 'You can handle this.'

**Speaker B:** Yes, and I don't know if it's

**Speaker A:** different from— but anxiety, forget about it.

**Speaker B:** Forget about it. But yeah, I don't know if it's different from person to person, but for me, the confidence is a very particularly important factor, knowing that you can handle it and you can make it your bitch. It's very, very important for me. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yes, this is, this is a major part of the teaching, but it's not yelled out. It's something that is there. It's actually stated clearly in the suttas that this is the first step of the Noble Path, is that knowledge and confidence that I can clean out the mind. I don't care what kind of crap is in there, I can throw that stuff out.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because this is not something that

**Speaker A:** is so, so much freedom. I mean, wow, to have that. Hey man, I can do this.

**Speaker B:** It's a great feeling. It's a great, great feeling. But it's not through learning MBSR during university, not something that was ever touched on, speaking about confidence or anything like that. It's not something that was mentioned once. Which, seeing how important it is, I know we've spoken about it before, but it's like, why would you leave that out? Come on. Leaving out some of the best bits. It's like an unfinished cake. You know, you've not got any topping or any nice stuff in it.

**Speaker A:** The medical model is built that way. Yes, you have to repeat that. Once you walk into the door of the doctor's office, he's got you until he buries you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. I saw it was just a screenshot of an article that said, are improving medical practices good for business? And I was like You need to save people. It's not about business and money, but unfortunately— and that's the word for improvement.

**Speaker A:** That's all they want to sell. They don't want to sell a cure, they want to sell an improvement.

**Speaker B:** Little incremental improvements which keep you there and keep the money flowing in.

**Speaker A:** Precisely. And every psychologist practices this. Every psychologist knows more about their client than they're dare willing to tell them.

**Speaker B:** No, no, good, not nice. No, no.

**Speaker A:** Well, you can figure all that stuff out by yourself. All you have to do is pay attention. Look closely now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And you do so with a, with a gauge, not that whatever I think think is okay. I'm just here for the Vipassana. Yeah, no, this is completely different. No, this is— you've got to seize control of the mind and discriminate: is this thought worth having or not? And when we get good at being able to make that discernment, that discrimination, we don't let a whole lot of thoughts in anymore.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, when you get really good at what? Because a mind moment is a tenth of a second, a twentieth of a second.

**Speaker A:** There's something in that, yeah. Yeah, so a twentieth of a second is— I mean, I don't know anyone who's down to that level, but we'll get an AI.

**Speaker B:** But you know, you can get it very quickly. You think about it, you notice that the mind's wandered off. Okay, that's half a second, and then you see where it's gone, that's maybe another half a second, and then you're like, whoa, we're not going there, that's another half a second. All of that in the space of call, and we're back. Okay, brilliant.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's amazing how many mind seconds or mind moments can happen that are out of the flow. An example of this, in fact, is looking at— they did this kind of experiments a long, long time ago starting with, and when I say a long time ago, I'm talking about with the speed of the film at 10 frames a second. They were already then experimenting. In fact, I think I know who was doing it was Edward Bernays, that he would go into the film industry and slice in an extra frame or two occasionally of a skeleton. Okay, it was a horror movie. You want people horrified, and that skeleton comes by so fast that it doesn't register on their conscious mind.

**Speaker B:** But unconsciously, something is— they've seen something and they're unsettled by it. So

**Speaker A:** it didn't take them to start putting candy and popcorn. And that's how they were experimenting in the old days, was how long does it take. And if they go up to the standard of 24 frames a second, then how many frames can you have in a row before half the audience knows that you put something in there? And how much different it is, or can you blend it in with the same colors so that it becomes even more subliminal because it's not a stark reality of a black and white skeleton, that if you've got reds and greens in there, then this skeleton is obvious to see if you could actually look at it, but it's in reds and greens. So it gets really subtle like that. There's a whole lot of research that's been done on reaction times, and that you can actually do this online also.

**Speaker B:** The clicking of the button,

**Speaker A:** yeah, when it changes color, they change it from— right. And you can see that your mind, uh, you can begin to look at your own mind operating at those speeds,

**Speaker B:** because we don't Yeah, no, there's, uh, the— over the past few days I've been going to see friends and whatnot and getting on trains to see them, and you have a little button and you've got to wait for the button to flash for you to press it to open the door, and I'm there like— and then it flashes and I'm like, oh, oh, that was good, that was good, because I remembered what you said about the changing of the color. So I just thought I'd play myself a little game. I mean, I don't have anything to time it, but as I get on the train, I'm like, whoa, yeah, that was a good one.

**Speaker A:** Okay, all right, well, these are the kind of games that Dhamma dudes play, is to check yourself. How's things going? Yeah, okay, this is part of the examination of the wholesome that we had started to talk about, that in fact Once the mind is wholesome thought one after another and we're not generating our own crap, then basically the whole reality that is there to be now fully investigated is mostly and all wholesome. And that's what the delightful part is, in the sense that we can begin to now examine Sati. We can begin to say, how's my investigation? How is my reaction time? Okay, this is exactly the kind of testing that we begin to to, let us say, become aware of, not necessarily seek it out, but there it is. Okay. Yeah, there it is. And so let's check this out and start watching our response time and our reaction time and things like that, because that's exactly what we need to do when somebody yells at us or they insult us or something immediate happens. Then in fact, what we're actually looking at is startle reaction time. Okay, what is it that will startle you? Which means that instant, instantaneous fear that arises within one or two mind moments. Yeah, only a tenth, maybe a fifth of a second, and all of a sudden, you know, and all that happened was lightning or whatever. In fact, one of the things that I remember, this happened several years ago, that lightning flashed so brightly that it was completely wiped out bright in all directions around, while simultaneously we could hear two sounds. One was a crack followed immediately by a boom.

**Speaker B:** Oh my goodness.

**Speaker A:** And everybody in the house was off the floor. I said, Darren, that was amazing to see everybody jump. The dogs jumped. I mean, they didn't have to get up to jump. They were laying prone and they're jumped. Everybody just jumped. That was just so amazing to watch. But I was there for it so that I could watch the others react to it without having to react to it other than the very quick pleasure of the reality that, hey, that was a big one and I didn't react, didn't catch. It's a good way of checking fear is your starter reaction.

**Speaker B:** That's a good— that's interesting, your startle reaction,

**Speaker A:** because that's instantaneous fear. What else is it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's not something which is— yeah, if it's instantaneous, it's not something you can really predict or prepare for. It just happens. So your response is a very, very natural one.

**Speaker A:** And the question is, how many mind moments does it take you to figure out what's really going on? Yeah, in other words, is your— this is lightning, a big one— at the same mind moment as, uh, the starter reaction comes at, which would basically be only one mind moment after the flash started, or actually the Bhikkhuni started, as that point happens, because it all happens at the same time. And then one or two mind moments later is when that startle reaction that people are going to have, and within half a second they're going to be in the air.

**Speaker B:** That's an interesting way of looking at it. Yeah, yeah. Prepare the startle reaction. What can startle me? What can I find?

**Speaker A:** That's the whole thing, is that we recognize that there is nothing. That can startle you. Yeah, that's part of that confidence.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, puff my chest out. Yeah, confidence. Puff my chest out, walk around proud like a lion. Oh, you see a lion patrolling his territory, he's head up, walking chest forward, walking very proudly. Nothing's going to come and mess with him. That, that That's the confidence right there. That's the image I have when I think of the confidence, a lion patrolling the border of its territory. Right, that's right, that is confidence. Nothing's gonna mess with that.

**Speaker A:** You can handle anything, even something that's pouncing on you, literally.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, what's that, another lion? No, I can handle that. I can— a gang of cheetahs? I can handle that.

**Speaker A:** So we're talking about then two things. One is quick reaction time, and you know that you've got good reaction time.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. This is actually a good thing if we can begin to then focus that reaction time onto what's really going on within the own mind. This is in fact why some sports people, and a good example would be martial artists, that if you're not watching what's going on, you're going to get punched in the face. Okay, with that kind of mentality, it's easy to teach them Anapanasati. Once they see the danger, they wake up because they've been waking up to see the dangers.

**Speaker B:** They've got to have full awareness.

**Speaker A:** They have full awareness for what's going on.

**Speaker B:** But now, just looking at the face there, you know, you got to protect your body, you've got to protect your calves, your thighs. You know, you might not be in punch, somebody might try and take you down. You've got to be aware and ready

**Speaker A:** to combat whatever kind of a bodily awareness. Yeah, that the body itself can pick up on the fact that somebody's sneaking up behind you. I don't know how to talk to people about this because it all of a sudden becomes kind of magical rather than more vibrational. But, uh, but Dhamma dude, nobody is going to sneak up on a bit on a good Dhamma dude. Ordinary people get so engrossed into what they're doing, they're not having any sensory awareness around them at all.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that's very true. That, you know, you have the five senses, but then you have additional lesser-known senses like the sense of your surroundings. You do, it's scientifically proven, you do have the ability to just know what's around you, whether it be objects or if somebody's approaching, stuff like that.

**Speaker A:** Surrounding sensory awareness, and it has one of the qualities is that it has proprioceptive. Now what we mean by proprioceptive, the first way for a student to become associated with it is understanding the body's actual position down to every bone in your body. All you have to do is pay attention and you know exactly where each toe is in their relationship to each other. You know exactly where your armpit is. You know exactly where your hands are and outstretched and whether they're in a fist or open or moving or whatever it is. If we pay attention to it, we immediately know what's going on. This is called proprioceptive awareness. And it needs to be developed as a skill. This is part of what the Buddha is talking about in that Anapanasati Sutta when he says experience the whole body, including the postures that we're in and all of the sensory awareness around us. And this is exactly what the Mahasi is talking about when he talks about rising, falling, touching, which is touch sensation, and then sitting. What's your posture? What's your body doing? What's its relationship to the world and the atmosphere around you? Okay, and this is actually a sensory awareness that athletes pick up because they need it to play their sport. And to a degree, some musicians and certainly dancers need it. But computer people, they have another function of the brain, and so we can teach them in various different ways also. But this idea of having this open sensory awareness of the environment that we're in means that in fact martial artists are hard to sneak up on.

**Speaker B:** Oh yes, right.

**Speaker A:** Why? Because they're paying attention to where they are. They're looking around with the back of their mind. I mean, this is— I mean, teachers have been accused of that forever, having eyes

**Speaker B:** in the back of their head.

**Speaker A:** No, they're just paying attention to what's happening in room, and they can do that with a whole lot of sensory awareness without having eyeballs. Okay, so this is that whole waking up, or the sensory input of the sensory awareness that is associated then with that startle reaction, because people who don't have this sensory awareness are the ones who will have the body itself do that reaction that's associated with the startle. So you have two things going on: the startle and the reaction. That's two mind moments. It happens and then the body reacts if the mind is not there to take over the body at that particular mind moment. If the mind is not there with wisdom, then at that point of contact when that startle happens, then the body is going to react to it by flailing and sometimes even by jumping,

**Speaker B:** jumping several feet in the air, sometimes right into the air.

**Speaker A:** That was quite amazing. The whole crowd was off the floor.

**Speaker B:** That is a very good point though. You have your reaction and then you might have an additional reaction on top of that from the mind. Yeah, but then a trained and aware—

**Speaker A:** and, uh, right, and then look at that cycle that can get going, the cycle of terror, especially if you're not really aware of lightning storms and haven't been in them before.

**Speaker B:** In the UK, we don't get— the

**Speaker A:** gods are after us. Okay, so yes, that's exactly what happens with ignorance. But with wisdom, then how quick is that wisdom? How many mind moments does it happen before you're awake? And so these are the little tests that we can have to say, okay, this is the level of awake. I can push that button. Yeah, I can respond to that. Yeah, yeah, Kitty, I can set it up so that Kitty tries to hit me and just in time I grab her arm instead. Yeah, yeah, that, and that quick reaction time actually is something that's practiced in martial arts.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they have to be able to quickly react. You know, some people have a very good jab, they don't telegraph it. So you need to be able to— where somebody might load up, right?

**Speaker A:** Some people, some people, right, they're on the floor.

**Speaker B:** But then some people, they just poke it out. There's no telegraphing it, but they still need to be able to react to it.

**Speaker A:** Of course, the real point of it is that anybody who is doing this is already telegraphing, 'I'm out of here.'

**Speaker B:** Yes, if somebody walks up to you standing like that, then you know what's coming.

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato, wait a minute, I've got to go. I've got something over here to do. Okay, I'll be right back.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but there's the— I, uh, I do rock climbing, and, um, it's a very— it's a, it's a sport where you also have to be very mindful and very aware. Although, you know, you may be climbing up something and you think to yourself, okay, my right hand's got to go up there, what's the rest of your body doing? You can't just let it dangle. Because you're gonna fall off. You need to make sure, okay, my focus is going on up here, but what's the— what are my feet doing? Are my feet on this hold? How's my core tension? Uh, what is my left arm doing? Do I want to extend my center of gravity?

**Speaker A:** How close I am to the rock?

**Speaker B:** Exactly. So there's a lot of mindfulness, a lot of body awareness that you have to consider. While climbing certain problems, certain routes. So what you were saying, I thought it linked to quite nicely.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely, yes, that in fact this fits in exactly well to recognize that we do in some sports and some engagements and some activities, like rock climbing is one of them, If you don't watch what you're grabbing hold to, you're gonna die.

**Speaker B:** It's very true. It's very true. And in the rock climbing gyms, sometimes they drill holds into the walls, and sometimes they're not drilled in very well. You grab them, then they spin. And when you spin, you go, but then as long as the rest of your body is fine, your awareness, you know, That's like a startle reaction. You grab and then you immediately fall off because the whole thing— you wouldn't

**Speaker A:** want to do that though. Again, with that knowledge, that means that you're going to test it every time. Every one of those stages you're going to test it. You're going to try to see, can I get it to spin a little bit? Can I get this thing to pull out a little bit? And then we start putting gradual force on it until then we know, okay, now I've got my fingers on that thing. Yeah, and so it really has to do with the confidence because we're checking. That would be the one reason I would say that people would fail at rock climbing. Yeah, rock climbing with your own mind, that's the big one.

**Speaker B:** Climbing your own mind. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I've seen a lot of people climbing up something and then they just don't have the confidence, and so they're like they start freaking out, which is not what you want to do. It's not what you want to do. There was a— I lived in Malta, south of Italy, Sicily, for a bit during university, and the person that I was living with and I, we went off to, um, this area to do a snorkel survey. We were looking for stingrays and stuff like that. And so we finished, and there was this really, really nice cliff that led up into the water, and I was like, I'm gonna climb it. And so I climbed some of it, and then she joined, and then her confidence just went straight down, and she froze. Fight, flight, or freeze. And she froze. Her confidence went— there was none of it. And she— well, the only thing you

**Speaker A:** can say was, take a deep breath, breathe.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, literally, take a deep breath, breathe, don't freeze, continue to climb up. That's anything you can do, or just drop in. It's that you've got water below you, it's fine to drop in. But she didn't go up, she didn't go down, she just stayed there just shaking until her arms were so tired and her forearms were so pumped that she did just fall in. But she was fine at the end of the day.

**Speaker A:** Okay, think about it like this metaphorically. How many people do that exact same thing day after day after day, sometimes several times a day?

**Speaker B:** I need several hands with more fingers to count the number of people who would be doing that.

**Speaker A:** And I'm not talking about necessarily rock climbing, I'm talking about the rubble that they're in. That rock is just too big. Oh yeah, we freeze, right? Exactly. Yeah, the example of climbing the Everest of one's own mind is an old analogy. Yeah, let's go mountain climbing, let's get to the top of this thing. That's all in the sense of the lokottara. Or being above the world. I think I mentioned to you the concept that everyone is an emperor. Every one of us is an absolute emperor of our own pile of dirt.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Every one of us is an emperor of our own pile of dirt. Are you going to be buried under your pile of dirt? Or are you going to be on top of it? Exactly. You've got to be on top of your world. You've got to be on top of this stuff.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, make your own.

**Speaker A:** Because it's our own dirt. That's the thing that's so funny. I made all of this stuff. Why am I even keeping my dirt around? Why don't I just sweep it out?

**Speaker B:** Sweep it out. Make it your own. Yeah, you've got all this dirt. You've made the dirt. So get rid of the dirt. But people like to be crushed by their dirt and complain about being crushed by their dirt. Pity parties and complaints.

**Speaker A:** That's a very interesting one, by the way, is that in the lifestyle that you're beginning to create, we begin to look for any sign of wanting to complain about anything to anyone.

**Speaker B:** It's something that annoys me so much. I know it's not something that It's something that I used to— I mean, I still do a little bit get annoyed by it, but people who complain about something and the way to get over their problem or the issue that they're facing is staring them directly in the face. Why are you complaining? Do something about it. Be proactive. If you've got the answer staring at you directly, what are you doing staying around in the crappy situation that you find yourself in when it's so that you put your obvious— that you put yourself in. Yeah, and then it's so obvious to change.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. In fact, this is exactly what you would call a pity party. A pity party means I've got this long list of complaints, please sit down and listen to me with all of my complaints.

**Speaker B:** That's what you said. That's called a victim mentality. I thought about what you said, I think it was one of the first lessons that we had, like if somebody over in the West falls and they scrape their knee and then everyone gathers around them like, "Are you okay? Oh my goodness, whoa, is everything all right?" But then you said if you've got like young children playing in Thailand, somebody falls over and they scrape their knee, they're just like, "Come on, get up, let's go." Yeah, you know, they don't wallow. Wallowing is terrible, and it's something that a lot of people enjoy doing for some reason. But remaining in your right— enjoyable— why

**Speaker A:** do people do that is because they enjoy being the victim. Because if they are a victim, that means that they get to judge other people for victimizing them. That's part of their revenge strip.

**Speaker B:** It just doesn't make any sense to me.

**Speaker A:** Well, you could see it as the unwholesome. Yeah, they don't see yet the unwholesome. They only see the gratification of being able to take it out on whoever they're complaining about. Yeah, without having to suffer the consequences of doing the complaining to the right person me in his face, that I could get you to listen to me complain about him. This is also in Wright's speech called Malicious Gossip, but it's still basically nothing but complaining. Let's get somebody else. Let's, uh, Eric Byrne had a phrase for it. He, it was, um, let's you and him fight. Ah, you hear that in there? Yeah, right. Okay, but I'm having a pity party. I'm the one who's complaining to you, and now you got to go do something about it.

**Speaker B:** It's your pile of dirt. You do something about it. Do you like being in your pile of dirt? No. Stop complaining about it. Sweep it away. Hoover it up. Come on, the Hoover's right there. There we go, pile of dirt's gone. Lovely. Anything to complain about? No. You're feeling better? Yes.

**Speaker A:** Well, that point that I was making a moment ago has a subtlety to it, and it's cultural. It's not necessarily real, but it's cultural in the sense that women, when they have the pity party They only want to have a pity party. When men have a pity party, they want to enlist you to get you to go do the job, which means that the guy who goes and listens to the woman complain, he thinks that it's a call to action and he's got work to do, and she's not giving him any work to do. She just wants to complain.

**Speaker B:** Oh my goodness, it's very true. It is very true. My girlfriend, she'll complain to me about something and I'm like, well, okay, here, here. I lay out some things. And you lay out all these solutions and what are these solutions? No, she doesn't want to hear anything. Literally, literally. I think I'm trying to be helpful here. I'm like, oh, why have you tried this?

**Speaker A:** No, no, no, stop helping, Gino, no.

**Speaker B:** Oh, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's Arya to me.

**Speaker A:** See that? Because it's so funny to see.

**Speaker B:** It's very funny. It's very, very funny. But, but it doesn't make sense to me. If there's something wrong, I want to, I want to act upon it and rectify it. But some people, they just want to— they just want to run their mouth.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and I want to complain. Exactly. So we have to— that's back to then, the, the issue of Really, it's not my business. Just because somebody's complaining, it doesn't mean it's a call to arms.

**Speaker B:** That's true. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Call to action. That we can begin to understand that, wait a minute, there never has been really a call to action. We just thought that there was. We misunderstand almost every complaint and everything that we hear. As a call to action. A very good point. Black Lives Matter— many people interpret that to be a call to action, either for or against it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's a good point. You don't have to necessarily act upon what you're hearing, what you're listening to,

**Speaker A:** and we just don't have to react to anything. It's not my business. I don't have— it's not my problem.

**Speaker B:** It's not my business. Forget about it.

**Speaker A:** Forget about it. Exactly. And there's where that confidence comes in. The confidence that I can in fact forget about it. It's not my problem.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. I tell you, the confidence really is a big thing. It really, really is. And in terms— this is, this is wholesome thoughts. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** That's the foundation. If you continue to work with keeping your thoughts wholesome, that confidence will grow. It'll build. It's part of the package.

**Speaker B:** My mane will get bigger. I will be a stronger lion. Maybe at the moment my mane isn't fully formed. It's a bit patchy here and there, but as the confidence grows, I'll have a big beautiful mane.

**Speaker A:** Here's something interesting. When Danny was going through this stuff that you're going through right now, he and I used to swap, uh, lion photos on Skype.

**Speaker B:** Really?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** What, what lion are you feeling like today? You got a lion with a, with a patchy mane? An old lion? A young lion with no mane?

**Speaker A:** A lion with a big— whatever presents itself on the internet, you capture it, you throw it in there. One of them that was the funniest one of all was a big huge lion somewhere at some zoo or something sitting in a wheelbarrow, and he could barely fit into that thing. It was a small wheelbarrow with that lion in it. And guess what? Ain't nobody going to push that wheelbarrow anywhere. That lion now owns that wheelbarrow.

**Speaker B:** Nobody's going near that wheelbarrow.

**Speaker A:** So anyway, yeah, that's the idea, is having that kind of imagery, the imagery of confidence that we can handle this, that this is what the Buddha has as part of the teaching. It's subliminal, but it's definitely within the teaching of the Buddha, of that confidence, right attitude. The lion— the Buddha was known as a lion, on top of his game,

**Speaker B:** the top predator. Yes.

**Speaker A:** Well, in a way, there's also a confusing statement. There's a description of someone who is, let us say, on the top of his game. That description has to do with that he's— it's a really strange way of talking about it, but basically is saying he's not worth messing with.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** That a lion is not worth messing with is the way that it's expressed.

**Speaker B:** You're gonna get destroyed if you try and mess with a lion.

**Speaker A:** Look at— okay, but you could see that also in debate or in conversations, especially conversations around my Dharma is better than your Dharma.

**Speaker B:** Ah, okay.

**Speaker A:** And you go mess with a lion, that's not a wise thing to do.

**Speaker B:** That's with a lion, you're going to get bitten and it's not going to be good.

**Speaker A:** No. Well, in fact, you'll enjoy being his lunch.

**Speaker B:** Because you'll find a way to complain about it and complain to other people about it.

**Speaker A:** They may not even know that he's been had for lunch.

**Speaker B:** Oh

**Speaker A:** yeah, he may know, he may not know that he's just been eaten because it was done with such delicacy.

**Speaker B:** Oh. Such skill, such delicacy. Oh

**Speaker A:** damn, but if he goes back and reviews the video or he goes to talk to somebody else about it, point out a couple of things that

**Speaker B:** happened there, and then they'll realize and they'll be like, wait a minute, redo.

**Speaker A:** So we're talking about being a lion today, getting your mojo going, getting that, um, right attitude that's built upon success. The success of being able to have a mind that's wholesome.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And I cannot think of anything more, uh, worthy of calling it a success than being able to maintain wholesome thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's definitely still a work in progress, but having those realizations and actually seeing where the mind goes and stuff like that really fills me with confidence.

**Speaker A:** Talk about it like that, we'd rather— we could also say sometimes you feel like a nut and sometimes you don't. Sometimes you could catch that stuff lickety-split Sometimes it slaps you around before you wake up.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a very good way to word it. But the prevailing trend is positive.

**Speaker A:** Wakey, wakey.

**Speaker B:** That's the joke.

**Speaker A:** Let's look out and see what's going on before that stuff gives us anxiety, before we go into guilt. Or whatever. So this is the right practice. Ben, I'm really pleased with you. Great for you. Pat yourself on the back. You're going great.

**Speaker B:** It feels good. It really does feel good. So I mean, yeah, many thanks to you for these lessons and whatnot. I do very much enjoy our conversations. It's A good start to my Sunday. A very good start to my Sunday.

**Speaker A:** Well, we'll finish now, but in that regard, have a good moment, one after another, after another.

**Speaker B:** You too, you have a good moment, one after another and another. Yes.

**Speaker A:** All right, we'll see you soon.

**Speaker B:** See you soon. We'll Will do, will do. Take care now.

**Speaker A:** Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with participation from a Sangha friend (Speaker B), explores the core Buddhist concept of **Samsara** as a mental cycle and contrasts it with the wholesome cycle of the path. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: Two Cycles of the Mind**
1.  **The Unwholesome Cycle (Samsara):** This is the cycle of suffering, described not as a magical rebirth but as a tangible mental process: **thoughts give rise to feelings, and those feelings give rise to more thoughts**, creating a self-perpetuating loop of anxiety, planning, and dissatisfaction. The mind jumps from one unsatisfying thought to another like a "monkey mind," always seeking but never finding true contentment.

2.  **The Wholesome Cycle (The Path):** This is the alternative, liberating cycle powered by **Right View, Right Effort, and Right Mindfulness (Sati)**. These three factors reinforce each other:
    *   **Right Effort** is applied to improve **Right View** (your understanding of reality).
    *   **Right Mindfulness** allows you to see the mind's movements clearly.
    *   This leads to **wholesome thoughts**, which create calm, satisfaction, and confidence, further strengthening the cycle.

### **Key Insights and Analogies**
*   **The Anxious Man and the Wall:** A story illustrates how we often misdiagnose the source of our anxiety (like a man fixing his wall at night) instead of looking directly at the anxious mind itself. We use tasks or distractions (like work or YouTube) as "placebos" to occupy the mind, but this doesn't address the root cause.
*   **Confidence is Crucial:** A major, often overlooked, fruit of the practice is growing **confidence**—the lion-like certainty that you can handle whatever arises in the mind, clean out unwholesome thoughts, and are not a victim of your mental patterns.
*   **"Forget About It" & "Not My Business":** These are presented as potent, practical applications of Right View. If a thought or external event causes anxiety, the wisest response is often to simply let it go—to see it as "not my business" and "forget about it," thereby cutting the fuel for the anxious cycle.
*   **Startle Reaction as a Measure of Awareness:** The discussion uses the example of a lightning strike to explore how a trained mind, with heightened sensory awareness and proprioception, can have a "startle reaction" without the subsequent panic and narrative. This quick, wise response time is a sign of awakening.
*   **You Are the Emperor of Your Dirt:** The metaphor emphasizes personal responsibility. We create our own mental "pile of dirt" (problems, anxieties). The choice is to either be buried by it, complain about it (have a "pity party"), or take command and "sweep it out" through wholesome thinking.
*   **The Present Moment is All We Have:** Time is relative to mental activity. True peace comes from learning to be fully present and "enjoying this moment" rather than being lost in thoughts of past or future.

### **Practical Advice**
*   **Discriminate Your Thoughts:** Actively choose which thoughts are "worth having." Don't assume your thoughts are okay just because they're yours. Learn to see unwholesome, anxiety-producing thoughts as "danger" and let them go quickly.
*   **Cultivate Wholesome Thoughts:** Actively generate thoughts of satisfaction, gratitude, and "this is good enough." This is not about forced euphoria but about recognizing and appreciating the vibrant aliveness already present when mental turmoil subsides.
*   **Use Daily Life as Practice:** Be mindful during everyday activities like walking, waiting for a train, or even rock climbing. Use these moments to check your awareness, reaction time, and presence.
*   **Build Confidence Through Success:** Each time you successfully notice and release an unwholesome thought, your confidence in the path grows. This confidence is a self-reinforcing part of the wholesome cycle.

In essence, the talk is a guide to switching from the automatic, suffering-producing software of Samsara to the intentional, liberating software of the Noble Eightfold Path, with a strong emphasis on confidence, personal agency, and the immediate application of wisdom in daily life.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several core metaphors and one extended story to illustrate their points about mindfulness, anxiety, and mental cycles.

Here are the key metaphors and stories used:

### **Core Metaphors**

1.  **Samsara as a Cycle of Thought:** The talk begins by framing the Buddhist concept of *Samsara* not as something magical, but as a practical **cycle** or feedback loop where thoughts generate feelings, which in turn generate more thoughts.

2.  **Monkey Mind:** This is a common Buddhist metaphor used to describe the restless, unsettled, and jumpy nature of the untrained mind. The speakers analyze *why* the "monkey" jumps: because it is dissatisfied or scared where it currently is, leading to constant, anxious movement from one thought to another.

3.  **The Lion:** This is a central metaphor for **confidence and mastery**. The speaker (B) imagines himself developing the confidence of a lion patrolling its territory—proud, strong, and unassailable. Speaker A affirms this, noting the Buddha was also called a lion, representing one who is "on top of their game" and not to be messed with. The growth of confidence is likened to a lion's mane growing fuller.

4.  **Climbing / The Pile of Dirt:** The mind's work is compared to **rock climbing**, requiring constant awareness, testing holds, and confidence to avoid a fall. This extends into the metaphor of everyone being an **emperor of their own pile of dirt**. The choice is whether to be buried under that dirt (one's mental burdens) or to get on top of it and sweep it away.

5.  **The Prison:** The wandering, dissatisfied mind is described as a **prison**. Even though its thoughts may range far and wide ("vast"), it remains a prison because it never finds true freedom until it generates freeing thoughts.

6.  **The Placebo:** Activities like watching YouTube or keeping busy with work to avoid anxiety are described as a **placebo**. They provide temporary relief (occupying the mind) but don't address the root cause, unlike applying "right view."

7.  **The Vehicle:** Managing thoughts is compared to driving. When you see an unwholesome thought coming, you "slam on the brakes" and "put the car in reverse." Speaker A then refines this to be even quicker, like the instantaneous reactions of **Bugs Bunny or the Road Runner** ("beep beep").

### **The Extended Story**

**The Old Man and the Fence (The Anxiety Story):**
This is the primary illustrative story in the talk.
*   **Plot:** An old man lies awake at night in his hovel, filled with anxiety. He interprets this anxiety as a signal that something is wrong. He settles on the idea that his fence needs mending, or wolves will get in. He spends hours in the dark repairing it, exhausts himself, and returns to bed, only to find the anxiety immediately returns.
*   **Moral/Purpose:** The story illustrates several key points:
    *   **Misattribution:** We often mistake internal anxiety for an external problem.
    *   **Ineffective Coping:** We engage in frantic activity (mending the fence) to quell anxiety, which only works temporarily because it's a distraction.
    *   **Lack of Awareness:** Even during the "solution" (building the wall), the man was terrifying himself with thoughts of wolves, so he never truly addressed the anxiety itself. He lacked the mindfulness ("Sati") to see the cycle.
    *   **Modern Application:** The speakers then state that modern lives are just more complex versions of this—we "hop from one unsatisfying thought to another" instead of mending fences.

### **Other Notable Imagery & Phrases**

*   **"Forget about it" / "It's not my business":** Framed as a useful, almost mafia-style, Buddhist phrase for letting go of anxiety-producing thoughts.
*   **Startle Reaction:** Used as a test for fear and awareness. The story of the lightning strike illustrates instantaneous, unprocessed fear versus the wise, aware mind that doesn't react with panic.
*   **Unfinished Cake / Medical Model:** Criticizing incomplete teachings (like MBSR without confidence-building) as an **unfinished cake**. The **medical model** is metaphorically accused of selling "improvements" rather than "cures" to keep the "money flowing."
*   **Victim Mentality / Pity Party:** People who complain are described as choosing to stay in their "pile of dirt" and throw a **pity party**, enjoying the role of the victim rather than taking proactive steps.

In summary, the talk uses the **Old Man's story** as a narrative anchor and builds understanding through the **metaphors of the Monkey (the problem), the Lion (the ideal), and the Climb/Pile of Dirt (the work)**, all to explain how to break the cyclical "prison" of anxious thought.
