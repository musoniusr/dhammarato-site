### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, it still says zero. Has any of you guys got a counter started yet?

**Speaker B:** Ours never shows counters, but it says Dhammarato is recording the call. It said it started, and now it went to that it's recording.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, let's assume that it actually is, uh recording. Um, and so this is our Saturday morning chat, uh, Friday night or Friday evening for you guys. Um, and that Todd had started asking a question about, um, anticipation or sitting down for meditation with the expectation of getting something, doing something, putting the mind into a certain state, all of that kind of stuff. And what I was pointing out was, is that that anticipation or that excitement is something that's trained into us in our culture, that in fact you can see it in advertisements on television. That they normally have a format. And the idea is to get you excited and in a state of excitement and then associate that with their product. So medication, it doesn't matter what medication it is, it always shows, let us say, older middle-aged couple on a beach or in a forest or someplace, right? That whole shot is because that's their target audience for selling that medication. I also remember how easy it is to get dogs excited. That in fact, one of the things that I can find really interesting here with these dogs is food is about the only thing besides my coming home that will ever get them excited because they've never been leash trained and they have freedom to go wherever they want to anyway. But there's a lot of stuff that goes on with that. And in fact, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about it in his book on Hunger and Happiness. That in fact hunger and happiness are deeply related in our culture, in the sense that we get hungry for something and we take happiness from getting that which we are hungry for. That's what we see as the gratification. Is getting that which we want. Now, there's a little bit more with that, and that is, it's not only the gratification or getting what we want or having the satisfaction, it's also the anticipation. An example of that is when the guy gets his paycheck. When he gets it, that's just a piece of paper. So why is a piece of paper making someone happy? It's because of the anticipation in his mind of what he's going to do later, now that he's got the paycheck.

**Speaker B:** I have read that we get the dopamine hit from the anticipation of an event rather than the actual event itself.

**Speaker A:** Right, that there are different chemicals. That's a very good point. I'm glad that you brought that up. I was actually going to miss that one. That is actually the anticipation of gratification that kicks that dopamine off, because that's like the last inch of the mile, or is actually the motivation, because just thinking about doing it makes us feel good. And so it's built right into the genes, it's built right in. But the way that society operates is that it uses these instincts that we have and then manipulates them. For instance, we're all territorial. We're territorial with territory, my town, my people, the exact same way that we're territorial with objects— my laptop, my cell phone. Then in fact, if you've noticed it, have you ever, because of some reason or another, used someone else's cell phone? Maybe they need Wi-Fi, or maybe they need help with a program, or maybe you need to use their phone or whatever like that, and you use somebody else's phone and you don't like that. Is foreign. It doesn't operate the way my phone operates. OK, so that whole territorial instinct that we have is a way of manipulating people. Because if it's mine, then it's good, and if it's not mine, it's not good, or if it's foreign, it might be dangerous. That instinct is what operates world politics at every level of unifying with one group by dividing away from another. This is also what causes hierarchies, where the reality is, is that we live interdependent, we live in a network. We don't live in a stratified society other than in the minds of the humans. And one of the ways we have for centuries, many centuries, placed upon that hierarchy is by looking at a person the way that they're dressed, and you immediately know where to put them. Even weird clothes. And so clothing and accessories and all of that has a way of putting us into things in the sense of our motivations or anticipation about how we're going to deal with that person. So this whole quality of anticipation is quite a big deal. In fact, one of the most humorous ones, the one that I remember the most, is in Rocky Horror Picture Show, when the guy— I forgot who it is who runs the place— but he's about to take the mannequin doll robot young boy upstairs, and he says it with the word of anticipation, he said, "Anticipate." Anticipating. All right, so the anticipation is often better than the event, that in fact sexuality has a whole lot more to do with anticipation because the event, and then it's over. We also have that when we're thirsty. That when we drink that water or whatever that's coming in is fulfillment. And but we still keep drinking because of that feeling of anticipation. We're a little dab will do you, but we keep taking more and more because of that dopamine hit and all of that. So That's one of the things about religion that's so amazing, is that they want to add to, multiply everything. I mean, glorious in excelsis in ex deo. I mean, big, big Latin for big gods and big heavens and big Armageddons, you know. That's the whole idea about it. And that glorious, magnificent is the kind of thing that we're looking for. But you can see that even the word glorious and magnificence has that quality of anticipation built into it, that what is glory is getting the glory. They old glory is not glory anymore. So, um, this is the way that we have structured our society, and this is one of the reasons why we are almost always left in a sense of desire, is because we got our dopamine hit, which was what we were looking for, with the anticipation, but the act— so the lighting of the firecracker and watching the fuse. But the pop is so small, there's not much to it. Getting what we want, there's not much to it. And so we want something else because now we're in the habit of this wanting and this anticipation. And so this is what we would mean then in the Buddha's language as unwholesome thoughts are all about an anticipation and getting things and whatnot like that. And so by changing the mind from unwholesome thoughts about the future, anticipation about to get something that's built really deeply now embedded into our, let us say, part of the mind that is intention, or probably the word is Samma Sanghappa. And that Samma Sanghappa actually, let us say it like this, that you've got a set of scales. You know, these kind of scales, weighty, uppy, downy, okay? And everything just— and we kind of think of God as like that. And every, every moment we're putting something on the scale, either heavy or light, or a good one or a bad one, right? We keep putting stuff on over and over and over again, and after a while the scales begin to set in a certain state. They've reached a homeostasis because the new stuff that we're putting on, small as it is, does not now add much to the weight of the stuff that's already been piled up. And this is the way that we want to look at in the sense of the Samskaras that we have, is we built it up so that the scale naturally tilts tilts in a certain direction. And that natural tilting of the mind is what we're talking about changing. And the way that we're going to naturally change the tilt of that mind is by start putting intentionally a whole lot of positive stuff on that thing until it begins to change the scale. Okay, so this is one of the points then, is that every time that you have anticipation for something in meditation, you're putting it on the wrong But if we look at it from the other perspective of actually having a wholesome thought is about a wholesome thought about what's happening right now, and right now is good enough. That in fact, one of the things that I find that's actually very beneficial in that is, never mind, I don't have to do that right now. Or, what a relief it is that I don't have to do anything. I don't have to go do something for the server right now. I don't have to go feed the dogs right now. I don't have to get out of bed right now. I don't have to even go to the toilet right now. Well, let me make sure. No, I can wait again. So that's a whole new way. So when we're beginning to sit down to meditation, we would sit down with the idea of, instead of wanting to get something out of your sitting meditation, sit down with the idea of, oh, I don't have to do anything right now, not even get anything out of meditation. That I don't have to get anything out of it anymore, because that's that anticipation of wanting something that we don't have and get anticipated so that we go get it. And then the last part of the anticipation is after we know that we are going to get it, but we haven't gotten it yet. That actually comes on a date. I don't know how many of you've been doing any dating, but there's a point on that date when you know you're going to get it, but you haven't gotten it yet. And some guys who are so insecure, they're getting it and they don't think they're going to get it yet. So that whole point then is to begin to look at these anticipations, begin to look at your own desire itself, or your own wanting something or expecting to it. And this is a really, really good opportunity to do that because here we are doing this thing called meditation, which is learning to come out of expectations. And here the Western meditation system is all about getting something out of meditation rather than stop getting anything out of anything and just enjoy what you've already got. That this present moment is quite nice, it's quite wonderful, until I want something out of it, and then it's not good enough anymore. So this is the point about waking up. Wakey wakey, come into this present moment knowing that I don't have to get anything out of my meditation. I don't have to get anything out of doing anything, that I can just sit here and take another breath. And if I get bored, okay, I'm bored, never mind. What is boredom anyway? It's just not paying attention. Let me pay attention, and where's the boredom? And so finding a nice place to sit, and then all we have to do is remember after that that I don't have to leave, I don't have to get up. You just sit here. You don't have to turn the laptop on. Just sit. That's the whole point, is to learn that things are already right now good enough, at least good enough to be a paradise. May not be a heaven, may not be perfect. But our society teaches us to make these two things, paradise and heaven, enemies. The good is absolutely destroyed by the perfect. And so with this position, we can recognize, oh no, let's go for good enough. And if we practice, our good enough bar is pretty low. So the perfect bar, way, way up there. But Paradise, that we could lower the bar. I mean, this is Paradise. All we have to do is stop judging it. To be not paradise. And I choose the word paradise because that introduces the story of Adam and Eve. It's right there in the Bible, and the Christians miss it completely. And that is, it is our knowledge of good and evil and having to put up with our decisions that we have made about what's good and bad is what destroys our paradise. Whatever paradise is in, if you don't like it, it's not a paradise. Whatever paradise you're in, if you find fault with it, that it's not good enough, it's not paradise. And here you are sitting down in paradise wanting results. Out of you being in Paradise. In fact, you're already in Paradise. The only place to go now is out of Paradise, which is also the story of the Pilgrim and Pilgrim's Progress. You know what a pilgrim is? He's the dude who's on his way to the holy site. Right. Well, what happens to the pilgrim when he gets to the holy site?

**Speaker B:** No longer a pilgrim.

**Speaker A:** Well, is he a pilgrim anymore or not is his own mind. And most of us who are such a habit of being a pilgrim, once we get to the holy site, we continue to be on our pilgrimage, and we'll have to leave that holy site to go to the next one. And so he winds up spending 99% of his time, more or less, between the holy sites. But at least he's touched base with several of them. And that's the way that we make progress. And here you are, pilgrim, in your holy place. You're in a shrine right now. You're in a temple of the human body. Where is there to go? Here we are. This is good enough. All we have to do is stop judging the environment that we're in, judging the paradise. And so this is another way of coming back to the point of when you're sitting down for meditation, sit down with the idea that finally I've arrived home. I'm now in paradise. Now there is nothing left to do, and I can finally relax because everything that needed to be done has already been done. There's nothing left to do except just experience and enjoy. That everything needs to be done has already been done. This present moment is perfect. Whatever had happened in the past was good enough to get you here alive and safe and contented. Marvelous journey, but now we can just rest. We're at home. And that's a marvelous feeling, to allow yourself just to feel at home. You're at rest, and anything that that house needs can wait. Silly things like, no, I don't have to wash the dishes right now, and no, I don't have to put ice cubes in the ice cube— or water in the ice cube trays, and no, I don't have to flush the toilet. And if you think about— look at all of these rules and all of this stuff that we're supposed to do in order to have a happy life. Turn back. No, you don't have to do anything. You're already in a happy state. Just sit down and relax. You don't have to attain anything. You don't have to attain any Jhanas. That in fact thinking about Jhana is probably unwholesome. And when you're not thinking about Jhana, what you are thinking about perhaps is applying the mind to the wholesome. And if you're doing that, you're in the Jhana. But if you start thinking about Jhana, now you're not applying the mind to wholesome thoughts anymore. You're applying the mind to something you want or something you're proud of. Whatever. And so this is what happens with Western culture is they grab a hold of these words that they don't quite understand and then pop them into the cultural mentality that they already have so that Jhana becomes an attainment, where in fact, of course, Jhana is being in a state to where you don't need to attain anything, and there is nothing to attain. So Jhana is almost always anticipated, and we do it through anticipation. So Todd, what do you have to say about this?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think that's exactly the moments that I realized what I was doing in that kind of anticipation of craving some sort of state. It was exactly that sort of thing. As soon as I dropped it and felt just present and okay with the moment, ironically, those, those, you know, good lush feelings came on spontaneously as opposed to the contracted, you know, internal tension that was there before. And I found even the past couple days I had had a longer sit and there were some back pain, but, you know, I just watched the sensations. Like, I don't You know, I've been really working with desire and aversion and, you know, seeing when the aversion to pain comes up, what is it really? And just watching the sensations as opposed to contracting around them and being like, oh, I don't want this feeling and just being able to look at it and, you know, see what it really is. And most of the time it's you know, sort of a paper tiger. And then the other day I was, I don't know, I don't know if it was a Jhana specifically or whatever, but after being there for a while and just being okay with it, I could feel the sensations, but I was in a very concentrated, calm place. I could tell one of my legs was completely asleep, but it was fine. And it was just, it was just okay. I was in a very comfortable stable place where I, you know, I don't think I was— I mean, I know I was awake. I wasn't like, you know, drowsy or anything. It was just a very concentrated, calm place where it was okay with the sensations that were otherwise, you know, considered to be uncomfortable.

**Speaker A:** And notice how starkly different that state is from the state of wanting something out of your meditation.

**Speaker B:** The irony is, after that, the next time I sat, I wanted to get to that spot.

**Speaker A:** Very, very common thing for students to do. Let's talk about back pain for just a moment, because people do experience it. Mostly they experience it because the back is now doing things longer periods of time and is getting tired. And so when the old masters talk about watching the back pain, there's more to it than what we normally think of as just watching it. That a much better way of thinking about it rather than watching it is to think about playing with it. And an example has to do with that is that if you're sitting up straight like this, then gravity is pulling us straight down. Engineers know all about centers of gravity. I mean, if you don't do center of gravity with everything you do, you're not an engineer. Cars are designed around center of gravity. And if your center of gravity is upright like this when you're sitting upright, then that's great. So we need to start to play with postures to find out what— instead of, oh, this is a comfortable posture, let's experience them so that we can actually find what is a really good balance point. Now, when there is back pain, normally that happens because we're not up straight and that the gravity is pulling us in one direction or another. And then the back has to compensate for that. And that's why the back gets tired. Now, some monks can slump and be great. Westerners, for some reason, though, when they slump, their back hurts a lot. And the Tabuda, there are some points about sitting up straight, but the important point also is about comfort. And so if you can sit more comfortably by sitting up straight, then the way that we can do this is by playing with it when the back pain comes, because that's the time that we need this most. And so that would mean then that when you're breathing in, as you're breathing in, you're breathing in in a way that it kind of raises you or straightens you out. And so we begin to sit a little taller. And then as we breathe out, we kind of relax and let that slide just a little bit. But while we're doing that in and out breathing, rising and falling with the body itself, now we can begin to play more carefully or closely with that back pain? Can we find out what muscle group it is that's in pain because it's overstressed, and can we relieve the stress from that? Can we sit in a different way that changes our muscle positions a little bit? Can we actually twist and turn and get the body to relax those muscles? That this is the whole point of Anapanasati is experiencing the body. And here is a wonderful opportunity to do that. When there's back pain, experience the body. But now we're experiencing it not like a— I started to use the word stoic, but I'm using it in the Western mentality way of doing it. Uptight drill sergeant kind of way, rather than what we're doing here is we're relaxing. The whole point of this is to relax. Step 4 of Anapanasati specifically talks about relaxing the body intentionally by knowing the body. Unfortunately, it's gotten some pretty high-polluting translations, and the high-polluting translations make this process high-polluting. By using words like tranquilizing the body, right? No, we're just talking about relaxing tight muscles. Just relax. This is an ordinary kind of process. This is not hypermutant. This is not religion at all.

**Speaker B:** So no, go ahead.

**Speaker A:** Go— no, please.

**Speaker B:** I was just going to say, because I had read that if you have back pain like that, it's usually because you have weak core muscles and it's not supporting you. And I found exactly what you said, that when I'm leaning forward, it hurts. And I sit back up, but then I can't seem to keep the core engaged while still having a soft, relaxed belly. Because you breathe deeply into the belly, it's like everything collapses back down again. Figured out how to maintain structure, but also that relaxed— because I feel like.

**Speaker A:** When I really hear what you're saying, that's good knowledge for you now to say that, that you can sit up. But when you sit up, that takes muscles that then you want to relax, which is like a relaxed belly. And when you relax the belly, the body falls over. Yes. Okay. Well, that's good knowledge. Here's a way of dealing with that, that in fact, in the West, often the idea is the more cushions, the better. That people will put cushions under their knees because their knees haven't sunk in. Well, if you're going to prop them up, how do you ever expect them to come down? All right. Here's the technique that's useful, and that is that you do want a small rise of 2 to 3 inches of the back part of the buttocks. That a regular pillow folded and folded so that you can sit on it, or in the— for the Bhikkhus, it would be the way that the large robe is folded to make it about this long, just a sitting cushion size. It's about this thick, about 2 inches big, and sitting on that. But you sit on it on the very, very back part of your tailbone, this right under the spine. This allows then the muscles to drop and relax so that you can in fact get the legs down. It also keeps the body wanting to stay upright. Now, I would say that tightening or loosening the belly muscles is optional. That's the important thing is comfort. Yes, that's, that's the cushion that we're talking about. You can also take that and fold it, take that round cushion and fold it and just sit on the folded part so that elevates the butt. That allows then that for the knees to drop. If you, if you have too much comfort too close out front towards the knees. So what you want to do is to actually put on the butt down so that it allows the legs to fall down while you're keeping the back straight. This is the way that will help. Also, from time to time, but we don't want to make it a.

**Speaker B:** A.

**Speaker A:** Crutch, but to sit against a tree, to sit against the building wall that you're on, and sitting next to the wall will then allow you to play with your body, to know for sure that the body is erect. Because it's against the wall, but it may not, even though that is completely erect because it's against the wall, is actually completely correctly balanced. You may in fact want to move out against the wall so that you can relax a little better. The important part is to be both balanced and relaxed, and that's close to being completely upright, but not exactly. And so you have to learn to play with this kind of stuff. Well, guess what? If you're going to sit there anyway, why not play with this kind of thing? To just play with it, because we're just, you know, learning how to relax the body. This is all part of, uh, breathing. And, um, the rising and falling, by the way, does not necessarily have to be the lower abdomen. I think that that's partly a translation error that's been around for a long time. When I was a kid in the 1960s, they called it navel gazing. Have you ever heard of that term? That fully indicates navel is down in the lower abdomen. Right. This is not what we're doing. We're relaxing the whole body, not a particular area of the body. And that, in fact, the relaxing of that part of the body has to do then more with breathing. That, in fact, if you have been a musician, especially wind instruments, you know, or singers, they know about diaphragmatic breathing, which is exactly what we're talking about. We're talking about the diaphragm, not the abdomen. Sorry about that, but the Western Buddhism, that's one of the other mistranslations. The diaphragm is a little bit above the belly area, and it's more in the, in the hara here, um, lower than lower than the tips, where the sternum— that area of the body. And also get in touch with your breathing by beginning to know where your diaphragm muscles are. This is part of the rising and the falling and getting used to watching what the body is doing. Um, play with the breathing. Play with very, very short, quick in-breath, and then a very, very long out-breath. Then play with a very slow in-breath followed by a very hard exhale out-breath. These are some of the things that we can play with, and it will help us to understand the body. But the whole point about the understanding of the body is to find where these tensions are that have been built up, sometimes in the neck, sometimes in the lower back. Sometimes the back pain is not really back pain, it's kidney stones. But the kidneys are located in, in close to the back, very close to the middle, but actually on the right side. And so that's where a lot of people have lower back pain. They'll have lower back pain on their right side. They need to go to a doctor for that because they need to get that kind of stuff checked out. But, um, other than that, there's, uh, wherever the pain is, play with that pain, making sure that you understand that you're calling that sensation in the body pain. And the word pain is loaded And it's loaded with, I don't like it. To where actually the body is just a messenger, that that back pain may in fact mean you've got kidney stones, or it also might mean, why don't you sit up straight? So these are the things to play with. To get to know the body. That a lot of people don't really quite put this together, but these are the whole point about the first stage of the Kaya Nibbhasana, is that we're playing with the body because we want to understand it well, because we want to understand it to make it more relaxed and comfortable. And when we see the body that way, and we also see that that's also what we're doing with the mind, then we can do kind of— if you want to go back to World War II— use a pincer movement between the body and the mind to also adjust the feelings. But I'm not going to get my feelings adjusted into comfort zone if I don't already have the body adjusted into comfort zone. Comfort zone. This is one of the problems with meditators who are sitting in pain. They're never going to get anywhere because they're already not in a comfortable position. That comfort is in fact part of the definition of the word Sukkha. If you don't have comfort, you don't have Sukkha. You can't have it. Sorry, that's just— I mean, if you're uncomfortable, you're uncomfortable. And so we have to get the body into a state of comfort and also getting the mind into a state of comfort. Well, guess what? Going back to the early part that we were talking about, and that is the state of anticipation is not a state of comfort, it's a state of excitation. And so by wanting something from meditation, you're actually going in the wrong direction. You're exciting the mind, rather than telling the mind, hey man, chill out, no place to go, nothing to do, just sit here and watch the body and help it relax. And when the body and the mind are together relaxed, that's when we can feel in our feeling system the feeling of safety, security, comfort, and satisfaction. And those are the 4 ingredients. I got this right out of the Pali dictionary. Safety, security, comfort, and satisfaction are the elements of the Pali word Sukkha, which is exactly opposite of the word Dukkha. And so this is how we get ourselves out of Dukkha momentarily. And if we can practice that momentarily, we can do it again momentarily, and we can do it again momentarily. That's the whole process. Now, the Westerners have the idea, oh well, I want to not just do it momentarily, I want to do it good enough so I don't have to do it anymore. And the answer to that, if you do it often enough so that it becomes second nature to you, then you don't care whether you don't have to do it anymore or not. That you, that you want to right now not have to do it anymore, because right now you can't do it. And again, we're back into that state of anticipation. Funny how the mind works like that. It's all backwards and things. So we have to straighten things back out by looking at how these words in Nepali actually operate together. So the first tetrad of the Anapanasati is to relax the body. And also the Citta Nibbana of understanding the mind. Then the next one is gladdening the mind or brightening the mind, which is on the way to liberating the mind. And then unification of the mind. Now, that unification of the mind, that Samadhi, does not mean concentration. We have to be very careful about the word concentration because it's got variety of definitions to it. And every time the student uses the word concentration, I'm listening. Yes, yes, what kind of concentration are you talking about? Because the concentration that we're talking about, the good kind of concentration, is repetition. Over and over and over and over and over again. That's the kind of concentration that we're talking about, to keep coming back. Never mind, start again. Never mind, start again. Keep coming back and rebuilding Sati. That way. That's the good kind of concentration. But that's not Western concentration. Western concentration is trying to take the Mickey out of it, trying to push and force and grab and anticipate and get something, right? And that this is why we mistake that word Samadhi, because the word Samadhi is gathering together the factors that we need. And the gathering together the factors that we need are actually very easy to do when we're paying attention. And that is, when we're paying attention, that it's easy to remember that I can have a wholesome thought rather than an unwholesome thought. And that's the whole key, is to coming out of the hindrances and staying out of them. That's the repetition part, is to be able to sustain it, to come out of it and to stay out of it, to come out of it and to stay out of it, to come out of it and stay out of it. What is coming out of what? Coming out of wanting something, coming out of anticipating for something. Just come out of that and be satisfied, and then learn to sustain that and let that grow. So this is the way that Anapanasati is structured, and that each one of these, uh, the four tetrads have four elements in it. With the body, it's the breathing in and out, long, uh, and short, and understanding the body, playing with the body, playing with your posture, adjusting things, finding comfort. Finding safety, finding security, finding satisfaction in the body as well as in the mind, so that then we can relax the body and relax the mind. So when the mind is now relaxed, it's liberated. And when the mind is liberated through the lack of hindrances, that means that now all of the factors start together in the mind and the mind is unified and whole. And Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about it in the sense of fit for work. And now, what is the work to do? To maintain this state. That's the only work there is to do. And to watch the arising and passing away of every little trivial thing that's going to grab you and drag you out of.

**Speaker B:** It.

**Speaker A:** And so I really appreciate your talking to me about the anticipation and the back pain, because they're actually interrelated, because we're doing the same things with both of them. And that is, never mind the back pain, let's find comfort. Or never mind the mental pain of wanting something out of the meditation Let's just relax that too.

**Speaker B:** I really appreciate all of your advice on it. It all hit home. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Robert. Do you have any comments?

**Speaker B:** That's a good question. Thank you for asking it. I do. Sometimes questions come up, but, um, not, not really any that come to mind at the moment.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, great. This has been a good talk. Not as long as others, but this has been good. Anybody have any other questions? Anything to say? Eric is so blissed out, we're not going to get anything out of him.

**Speaker B:** This has been really, really great. That's all I got. One more if you have time. If you got anything else to go on.

**Speaker A:** Say, what was that, Todd?

**Speaker B:** I said I could throw out one more if nobody else has anything, or if you want to go longer. Okay, what'd you say? I was just wondering if you have any tips on sloth and torpor during it. You know, the other flip side of that is getting to the relaxed state and then having, you know, slipping it like very quickly either starting to go on like a hypnagogic kind of a state, or just, you know, getting really sleepy really fast, and trying to revitalize to not have that happen.

**Speaker A:** Okay, um, the sutras have quite a lot to say about it. Um, the first thing that we can look at is, is that sloth and torpor actually are interrelated but different. That sloth is more like laziness, or how, why bother? And that this almost always comes out of doubt, which is also not just the hindrance of doubt, but it's coming from the attitude of a loser. Oh, poor me, what's the point? I'll never get anything out of this anyway. And that happens to people in a retreat. It happens a lot because they come in with anticipation of getting something, then they don't get it. And so now they get in the position of, well, I'm a failure at this, or maybe next time, but I've got to put in the time now because I'm in the retreat. I don't want to quit the retreat. I want to stay in the retreat, but I'm not going to do the retreat because I'm already a failure at the retreat. So I'm just going to sloth my way through it. We don't have to do that in a full retreat. We can do that in other times too. We can do it during whenever we're sitting in meditation and we're being in the state of dissatisfaction. So sloth is actually quite related to dissatisfaction and doubt. And the feeling of, let us say, what's the use, or why bother, or I'm not going to get anything out of it anyway, but I will go through the motions. In TA, they would call this a tryhard, because we're trying but not too hard, but we want to make the show to ourselves that we're trying hard, but we don't really expect to get any success. So that's sloth. Torpor is different because torpor actually is sleepiness, and sleepiness has to do more with a physical condition of the mind. They're interrelated in the sense that they wind up in both cases. Also understand that the hindrances are interrelated, as I've already pointed out. With the doubt related to the sloth or laziness, or I don't give a damn kind of an attitude. But also, when we get really tired, often we get very tired and then sleepy because we've been working too hard because we wanted something. And so these hindrances will go back and forth through the meditation session. We start off wanting something, then we get disappointed and we can't have it, and then we get lazy and we don't want to do it, and then we go to sleep. Or we work too hard, we get really, really tired, and then we go to sleep. So these are all the hindrances. Now, what to do about both of them has to do again with moving or waking things up, taking actually deep breaths. One of the primary ways that we do get into a state of sloth and torpor is because we are not in fact breathing very well. We're not thinking about it. We're not actually practicing the meditation correctly because we're in the hindrance of sloth and torpor. I mean, that's it. So the question is, can we wake up enough to at least take a deep breath or two? The next step would then be to rub the arms or to rub the limbs, to rub your knees, to get some sensation going, get it into the arms. Forgetting we're on a camera here, I just rubbed my legs. So we rub the legs, we can rub the body a little bit, get some energy moving, moving the body around a bit. This rigid sitting still posture kind of stuff that is built into the Western mindset actually is detrimental in many cases to the practice. That if you sit still hard because you're supposed to sit still hard, and that's all the proof that you've got that it's okay that you're in this meditation group is because you're sitting still, but you're not practicing any meditation at all, you're just sitting still, then you're getting really uncomfortable. That happens often. People don't know what to do. They don't know what the practice is. But everybody's sitting still. Where in fact many times the sitting still is the cause of the problem, that we do need to move. We do need to— in fact, at Wat Soan Mokkh, they give the instructions that if the body is in pain, go ahead and stand up. Stand up behind your cushion for 4, 5, 6 breaths or something like that, and then sit back down. If that doesn't work, then stand up and walk to the, uh, to the back of the room or even outside and do walking meditation. But this whole idea of, oh, you've got to do it exactly this way even though you're not fit for doing exactly that then let's have permission to do something that you actually would be beneficial to you right now. So some movement, uh, wiping the face, taking deep breaths, rubbing the limbs, standing up, walking— all of those things will help, uh, the torpor, especially the walking. The reason for the walking is because finally the guy is going to start breathing well again. Because all of the stuff that he was doing of rubbing his arms and his legs and his pants in his face and standing up and all of that, he's still not breathing. He hadn't figured that one out yet. If he'd start doing the breathing immediately, he wouldn't have to go through so much of the other procedures. And so why is that? Well, if you start breathing well again and getting the body oxygenated again and start doing Anapanasati again and start looking at your posture and all that, you're going to wake up. You've got the oxygen, you've got the— let us say now, as it were, motivation. That you could say that sloth and torpor actually have the lack of motivation. And so you say, well, wait a minute, you just talked 10 minutes ago about how terrible motivation was. And the answer to that is, yeah, we need to find a balance, don't we? There's a balance in there of just the right amount of motivation, but not too much, because too much motivation takes us into desire and wanting things and grasping and clinging. And not enough motivation puts us sleep. So that'll help you to figure it out.

**Speaker B:** Thank you very much. I'll play with that absolutely this week.

**Speaker A:** All right guys, well let's finish this conversation then. Eric, I'm really thrilled to see you again. I mean, my heart's just a piti-pat. I'm so happy to see that you're back in the lot.

**Speaker B:** Great, I'm too. I'm so happy to be here, like a great nice big family here. I love it.

**Speaker A:** Great, Robert, we'll see you too, maybe.

**Speaker B:** All right, guys, thank you very much. This is, this is wonderful. Thank you. Good to see you, Todd. It was good to see you, Robert.

**Speaker A:** Have fun with your practice.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. Thank you. Have a great week.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends, focuses on **overcoming anticipation and desire in meditation to find contentment in the present moment**. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: Letting Go of Anticipation**
- **The Problem of Anticipation:** Modern culture trains us to seek happiness through anticipation (e.g., advertisements, paychecks). This creates a cycle of desire where the *anticipation* of gratification (triggering dopamine) often feels better than the actual experience, leaving us perpetually dissatisfied.
- **Meditation Misconception:** Many approach meditation with the goal of attaining a special state (like *jhana*), which is itself a form of craving and anticipation. This "wanting something" creates tension and takes us out of the present.
- **The Alternative:** The true aim is to sit with the attitude: **"I don't have to do or get anything right now."** The present moment, as it is, is already "good enough" and can be a "paradise" if we stop judging it.

### **Practical Meditation Guidance**
1.  **Starting the Sit:** Begin by dropping all expectations. Relax into the awareness that there is nowhere to go and nothing to attain. You are already "home."
2.  **Dealing with Discomfort (e.g., Back Pain):**
    *   See pain as a messenger and an opportunity to **play with** and **understand the body**, not just endure it stoically.
    *   Adjust posture gently, use breathing to ease tension, and find a balance between upright structure and relaxation. The goal is physical comfort (*sukkha*), which is foundational for mental comfort.
3.  **Working with the Mind:**
    *   When anticipation or desire for a meditative state arises, recognize it as an unwholesome thought pulling you from the present.
    *   Shift to **wholesome thoughts** about the present: "This is good enough. I am safe. I can rest here."
4.  **Understanding *Jhana* & *Samadhi*:** These are not forceful attainments but natural states of unified, wholesome mind that arise when we let go of wanting and are fully present. Thinking *about* *jhana* takes you out of it.
5.  **Addressing Sloth & Torpor (Sleepiness):**
    *   Sloth is linked to doubt and a "why bother?" attitude. Torpor is physical drowsiness.
    *   Remedies include: taking deep breaths, rubbing the limbs, changing posture, walking meditation, or simply re-establishing relaxed but alert attention on the breath and body.

### **Cultural & Psychological Insights**
- Society manipulates innate instincts (territoriality, hunger for gratification) to create endless desire.
- Our "knowledge of good and evil"—constant judgment of experience as not good enough—is what destroys our innate sense of paradise in the present.
- The pilgrim's mindset—always seeking the next holy site—prevents us from recognizing we are already *at* the holy site (the present moment).

### **Conclusion**
The path is about **relaxing the body and mind** out of the hindrances of desire, aversion, and doubt. Through **Ānāpānasati** (mindfulness of breathing), we playfully engage with bodily and mental experiences to cultivate safety, security, comfort, and satisfaction (*sukkha*). The practice is a gentle, repetitive returning to a contented present, not a striving for future attainment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate the pitfalls of anticipation and desire in meditation, and to point towards an alternative approach of contentment. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The Scale (or Balance):** This is the central metaphor for how habits of mind are formed.
    *   **Description:** The mind is compared to a set of old-fashioned scales. Every thought or intention is like placing a weight on one side or the other (wholesome or unwholesome). Over time, as we repeatedly add weights (e.g., thoughts of anticipation, desire), the scale becomes heavily tilted in one direction, creating a habitual tendency or "homeostasis."
    *   **Purpose:** To explain how the habitual "tilt" of the mind toward wanting can be changed by intentionally and repeatedly placing "positive stuff" (wholesome thoughts of contentment) on the other side until the balance shifts.

2.  **The Firecracker Fuse:**
    *   **Description:** The dopamine-driven excitement of anticipation is compared to "lighting the firecracker and watching the fuse." The actual event—"the pop"—is often small and disappointing compared to the build-up.
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate how the **anticipation** of an experience (the burning fuse) is often more powerful and sought-after than the **fulfillment** itself (the pop), leading to a cycle of perpetual wanting.

3.  **Paradise and the Bar:**
    *   **Description:** The speaker uses the idea of "lowering the bar" for what constitutes paradise. Society teaches us to chase a perfect "heaven," which destroys the "good enough" paradise available in the present moment.
    *   **Purpose:** To argue that peace is found not in attaining perfection, but in lowering our standards of judgment and appreciating the current moment as "good enough" to be a paradise.

4.  **Pincer Movement:**
    *   **Description:** Borrowing from military strategy, the speaker suggests using a "pincer movement between the body and the mind" to adjust feelings.
    *   **Purpose:** To emphasize that comfort (*sukkha*) must be cultivated both physically (through posture, relaxation) and mentally (through releasing anticipation) simultaneously to trap and eliminate discomfort (*dukkha*).

### **Stories and Cultural References**

1.  **Adam and Eve (The Biblical Paradise Story):**
    *   **How it's used:** The speaker reframes the story. He argues that it's **our knowledge and judgment of good and evil**—our constant evaluation of experience as "not good enough"—that destroys our present-moment paradise, not a literal serpent or apple.
    *   **Purpose:** To directly challenge the mindset of seeking and dissatisfaction, suggesting that paradise is lost through our own judgmental thinking.

2.  **The Pilgrim (from *Pilgrim's Progress* or general concept):**
    *   **How it's used:** The meditator seeking a special state is compared to a pilgrim who is always *on the way* to a holy site. The irony is that once the pilgrim arrives, if they keep the identity of "pilgrim," they must leave to find the next site. Thus, they spend 99% of their time *between* holy sites, never fully arriving.
    *   **Purpose:** To critique the meditative mindset of always seeking the next attainment (Jhana, peace, etc.). The point is to recognize you are *already* in the "holy site" (the present moment, the "temple of the human body") and to stop being a pilgrim.

3.  **Rocky Horror Picture Show:**
    *   **How it's used:** Briefly mentions the line "Anticipate!" to humorously highlight how anticipation is often theatrically built up as the exciting part of an experience.
    *   **Purpose:** To underscore culturally how anticipation is glorified, often above the event itself.

4.  **Television Advertisements:**
    *   **How it's used:** Describes the formula of ads (e.g., showing a happy older couple on a beach) designed to create excitement and associate it with a product.
    *   **Purpose:** To show how our cultural environment actively **trains us** in the cycle of anticipation (hunger) and gratification (happiness), which we then wrongly bring to meditation.

5.  **Training Dogs:**
    *   **How it's used:** Mentions how easy it is to get dogs excited, contrasting it with his own dogs who are only excited by food or his return because they are already free.
    *   **Purpose:** To make a simple, biological point about how excitement is linked to perceived lack or desire, and how freedom from want leads to less agitation.

### **Core Message Linking Them All:**
The metaphors and stories collectively build the argument that:
*   **Meditation is corrupted** when approached with the common cultural habit of **anticipation** (wanting a result, a state, an attainment).
*   This habit is a deeply ingrained, dopamine-reinforced cycle where the *wanting* is more vivid than the *getting*.
*   The alternative is to **"arrive home"** in the present moment. See it as **"paradise"** or the **"holy site"** itself by letting go of judgment and the pilgrim's seeking mind.
*   Change comes not by force, but by patiently re-balancing the **"scale"** of the mind through repeated wholesome thoughts of contentment and "good-enough-ness."
