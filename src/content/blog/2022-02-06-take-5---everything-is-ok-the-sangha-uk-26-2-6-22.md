### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Yeah, most of the chats I have are not ever recorded.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and then quite a lot of them are then taken down because somebody chats and says, hey man, I don't want that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so instead of editing it out, we just take down the video.

**Speaker B:** All right. Yeah, yeah. I was just thinking too, because it was, um like still in like the Sangha call, so I felt like, oh, okay. But I know it's just the two of us right now, so yeah, but maybe more folks will join, you know.

**Speaker A:** Yes, in fact, that's been typically the case, that, um, partly because of the time zone.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that's why I was bringing it up before, because I was like, oh, okay, maybe a little early, but that's all right. Yeah, so I suppose in terms of questions, it's more also like clarifying things in terms of those different steps. So I kind of wanted to go through perhaps even like, so step 6, sorry, step 5 and 6. 6. That's the Piti, right? So the Piti is 5.

**Speaker A:** Okay, right. That's, that's first off, just before we get right down the wrong rabbit hole on the word step. Yeah, because that's in fact one of the major mistakes that we were talking about from the beginning, in the sense that by just in time for the, uh, the, let's say, the, the, the teaching on the didactic and the way of practice gets started in a retreat, the retreat's over. If you teach it in a particular order. And that's— even Bhikkhu Buddhadasa did that. But then not in the recorded sessions. The talk is, oh no, you're not supposed to practice it that way. That's the way that it's laid out in the suttas because it's laid out to be corresponding with the Satipatthana. And in those days, everyone was, let us say, literate about the four elements. Just like many people in high school now know that there's 92+ elements on the periodic table, back in the time of the Buddha, there were only four elements: solid, liquid, fire, and gas. And then from time to time, they would add space and consciousness to it, try to shove all those things into it. But the original four actually is the Satipatthana that the Buddha used in the sense of the body, the feelings, the mind is fire, and the mental objects is cloud floating by. And so now all of the Anapanasati Sutta is structured that way, but it's structured also in a kind of a didactic way. And when I say didactic, I'm actually talking about a diagonal or cut in it. In the sense that the first two of each of the four tetrads is like the beginners, and then the second two in each one of them is after— is for the adept. So exactly, each one of these is a two-stage process. Okay. And so in the Vedana, Titi Sukkha is developed before we see the relationship between the feelings and the mind, and then we begin to let us say, set those down. Hello, Drew.

**Speaker B:** Hi.

**Speaker A:** Welcome.

**Speaker C:** Hi.

**Speaker A:** We had just been starting the video only about 5 minutes ago and was just getting into the Anapanasati and the steps. So join in. Any questions you have? Okay.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, definitely. I'm gonna just gonna grab some food because I'm quite hungry right now.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, so real quick though, I did want to ask, like, rather than steps, like, how would you refer to them? Because like sometimes I'm thinking of like

**Speaker A:** parts, or when it comes to— how about dance steps?

**Speaker B:** Dance step. Yeah, I like that. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Actually, it's interesting because I was almost thinking about something.

**Speaker A:** Or like keys on a piano. Don't take them as 16 steps. It's 16 notes on a piano.

**Speaker B:** You're like playing them, right?

**Speaker A:** And then you're playing them. Exactly. What play do you play? Well, the order is the fact that the universe is playing music. And when we get in ki and get in harmony with it, that means that now we're playing the steps of Anapanasati that is in harmony with reality. But we have to practice some chords and scales first. But we can enjoy doing that too, yeah, so that we can get the fingering down. Okay, so this is an analogy with music. But in fact, we could say, "Yes, but in teaching music theory, you have to teach a C and a D and an E and the relationship between the C and the D and all of that kind of stuff," and yes, that's the way that it has been taught. For centuries. But once someone understands the process,

**Speaker C:** uh,

**Speaker A:** by putting it together like a puzzle, then when your eyes go over the puzzle, that doesn't have to go in the sequence that you put the puzzle pieces together. You can see it as a whole one-piece show.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I like, I like that though, that, that, um analogy with the dance steps and also, yeah, with the chords and the scales too, like doing, you know, that, but then it's bringing it all together, right?

**Speaker A:** Now you could say that there are two sutras, or actually a student recommended that we add the third one, and that is 117, 118, and 119 out of the Majjhima Nikaya, where the 117 is basically telling the details of what to do and how to practice the Eightfold Noble Path. And then, bingo, the next sutta is the Anapanasati Sutta of how to actually practice that. And then 119 actually is speaking of the Jhanas and the states that you go through like that. And there's also a companion sutta with it, number 111, kind of out of sequence, but really, really close in that group is that one that you mentioned, the one by one as they occur.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And so all of these things fit tightly together, these 4, 5, 6 suttas right there in a row. And so let's go back to that first one, the 117, the Eightfold Noble Path. Is where he actually introduces that is, listen carefully, monks, and I will teach you right organization of mind with its supports, requisites, and features, knowing that features are different than requisites or supports. And then he talks about the four requisites of that mind, and those are right Sati, right View, and right Effort run in circles around one another, and then the fourth one is added, and that is Samma Sanghappa, which we're now looking at in the sense of, we could say, right intention, but there are other words that may help, and that is, right expectation, right attitude, or something that is a little bit more than free thought. It's not actually thought. It happens so fast, it's like a leaning. And we begin to lean now in a direction of comfort, safety, security, and success. Security and success. Security.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And this security and this success is based upon Actually, security and safety is part of the base. Then we can feel comfortable, and after we feel safe, secure, and comfortable, then we can feel satisfied. And as we begin to feel satisfied more and more often, we begin to get the attitude that I can feel satisfied, that I don't have to feel dissatisfied most of the time because I know how to feel satisfied. And that's the change in the attitude from being a loser into being a winner. I can do this.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And this is explained right there in that sutta. And that when we have these four factors that run in circle around each other as a group of three until we add that fourth ingredient and that is in place, that as you begin to see that you can change your mind from an unwholesome state of a victim's position into the wholesome state of we've got this, we can handle this. I can handle anything. Doesn't matter what happens. I can take care of it. Even if it's having a happy death. Doesn't matter what it is. I can take care of it. I can handle this. The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune have no target here. Because a me or an I is not going to stand up to become the target.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no, I love that. Yeah, you went through like just like so much of it with that too, but that, yeah. Was it 117, right? That's the Great Forty, right?

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's the Great Forty.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. But yeah, that kind of way of sort of, I suppose, viewing the path too, right? With the Sati viewing and effort running in circles, then coming to the right attitude, right? Which is certainly helping me kind of, I suppose, have more of an understanding of the right attitude too, because it's more like there's a kind of a security to it, right? Like this is more of a consistent type of thing, right? Yeah. So, and I think that kind of moving over to this practice from— because I did prior do a lot of the noting, right— is I kind of feel more of that sort of security and that more of like the locking in, because there is like something to seeing the impermanence, you know, all the time, or when, you know what I mean, like spotting it, but then having that kind of locking in of the security with that, right, with the right attitude. Yeah, that coming up, and then that leading to the unification of mind, right? So yeah, the Samadhi.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Well, staying with that for a moment, there seems to be a point in that sutta where it takes a little bit of reading between the lines. After we generate those four, that is the point that's implied, is that's what creates the organized mind, because after that it starts into the Sila part in a completely different method, in the sense that once that mind is organized, with the mind this noble, one would not go harm someone. With a mind this noble, one would not take something that is not given. And so now actually what we're saying is, is that the Sila in that sutta is not a work for a beginner to do, but rather is expressed as the outcome of correct practice. And that's what's the difference between an ordinary practice where we start with the precepts and the Triple Gem. And here we're having a practice that winds up in the Triple Gem. And in a mind that's noble, that mind being noble is in fact now the mind that is capable of doing the precepts. Isn't that interesting? Because almost always precepts are taught upside down. In fact, there are several ways of talking about the Eightfold Noble Path. And that is Sila, Samatha, Pañña. You've heard that sequence, I'm sure. But that's not the order of the practice in that sutta. In that sutta, it starts with Pañña and then Samatha, winding up in Sila. And that means that's the Noble Path. The ordinary path is Sila, Samadhi, Pañña, and the way of looking at it is that at that point, when Pañña is arrived, then a shift is made off of the ordinary path of Sila, Samadhi, Pañña into the Noble Path. Where things are rearranged now, that the order is changed around, because now what we originally practiced first, the Sila, is now only seen as a natural outcome rather than the major work to do at the beginning of the path. That in fact One of the ways that we can understand that is whether we're putting on a long-term frame of reference or a very short-term frame of reference. And we bring it to a very short-term frame of reference, and all one needs to do is to become secluded from the world, and now your Sila is perfect. You go into the meditation hall and you sit down and you fold your legs and you close your eyes and you sit all happy and smiley face for a while. Your Sila right then and there is perfect.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that, that really does— I feel like that really does help like ease the mind as well, right? With that, like, okay, you know, I'm sitting here, I'm not harming anyone, you know, it's all good. Rather than— yeah, yeah, getting off into these long drawn-out things of, oh, I need to become perfected in this and that. And all those, you know, and perfect moral behavior and all that stuff.

**Speaker A:** That's the ordinary path. Yeah. And it works. And it can be called a slow, dry, hard, all of those kinds of words that ordinary people use. Or you can use Or you can go directly to the noble, that in fact this is what Ajahn Apo had said that he wanted on the internet. And he meant these Skype calls because he knows they're here and that to start off at the noble, that we do not drag people all the way from grade school through graduation of university in order to put them in graduate school. We just put them right into graduate school. They'll get what they need. The Noble Dharma. Some people say, "I'm not ready for it." That's okay, because if we wait until somebody's ready, that's going to keep the whole thing very small, which has been for centuries. The nobles have been around and had the criteria of basically the point is that The right student has to ask the right question at the right time to the right teacher in order to get the door opened. If you ask it at the wrong time, it will be misunderstood. If you ask it to the wrong teacher, he doesn't even know where the door is or what this is all about. But Bhikkhu Buddhadasa actually decided in the 1930s to turn all of that around. And that's what got him into trouble. But that was the best thing that ever happened to him because that was actually— he was figuring this out on his own as a monk, arguing with the Pali teachers in Bangkok and being invited to give public talks. That had an audience who went back to some of the biggest, most important monks in Bangkok to complain about this guy doing a— I think in fact it was a graduation ceremony for a nursing school or something like that.

**Speaker D:** It was a big thing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And in this trial that he was in, the Sangha de Sesa is where he met The fact that there were others on that trial board of 20 monks that understood what he was saying was correct, and it wound up starting a literature search. Part of the reason why the trial took more than 3 or 4 months was because it included a literature search. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa would spout something and he'd say it comes from that sutta. They had to all go back to the Pali and everybody translate it and figure out that Bhikkhuni was right here. And so, the outcome of that trial, just as a really humorous point, is that the outcome was that he was guilty of teaching the wrong things— excuse me, backwards. He was guilty of teaching the right things to the wrong people, a general audience. And that's what I'm guilty of, happily following my lineage. Guilty of— yes, sir, I'm absolutely guilty. Of teaching the right thing to the wrong people, because some of those wrong people will hear it and say, yeah, okay. And so far so good.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, no, it's, it's, uh, it's been going great.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so now let's talk back to these, these three suttas of 17, 118, and 119. And that is the 118 sutta is the Anapanasati Sutta that starts off as a really big deal in the sense that the sutta was announced in advance that the Buddha would be doing this. And then all of them gathered together at this full moon where you had Sariputta and all of his students and Chanda and all of his students and Mahakassapa and all of his students. I think Maha Marga was already dead by that time or gone. But in any case, the whole point was, is that it was a big collection of monks. And this is where he delivered the Anapanasati Sutta. But these guys, many of them already knew it. But he was also talking about a lot of stuff. This is in fact where the sutta is saying, oh monks, there is a great collection here. Some are Srotapanna, some are Sotagami, some are Anagami, some are Arhat. So there are those who are practicing Metta. Oh, there are those who are practicing Jhana. Some are practicing and getting to 4th and the 5th and the 19th. And no, He didn't go that far up to the fourth, in fact, that's all, but he mentions that. But then he says, talking about Anapanasati, as if it's different from these other practices, well, guess what, Jhana was already before the Buddha, Metta practice was already before the Buddha, but he's giving a new sutta or a new thing here that is of great fruit and benefit that follows the Satipatthana, and the Satipatthana is for the fulfillment of the Seven Factors of Enlightenment. Now, one of the things that people get confused on is not understanding the relationship between the Seven Factors of Enlightenment and the Eightfold Noble Path. I mean, it doesn't even have the same numbers, so how could it possibly? But the way to look at it is that the Eightfold Noble Path is the path, and that the Seven Factors of Enlightenment are the fulfillment of those skills. And the first item on the list of the Seven Factors of Enlightenment is unremitting Sati. Where is the unremitting Sati inside of the Anapanasati Sutta? It's at step 9 and 10 of waking up, taking a look, and gladdening the mind. The exact stuff that you see in the 117 is right here in 118, expressed in a completely different way. And then you can also see, all right, so it— the— maybe the sequence then is to wake up take a look, gladden the mind in steps 9 and 10, and then by doing that, it begins to change the Piti and the Sukkha in steps 5 and 6. All the while, we're already practicing step 1 or 2, but as we're practicing step 1 and 2 of the breathing, we begin then slowly to get step 3 because we're now beginning to see the feelings and seeing the connection and the feelings between the body and the feelings, and ultimately understanding the connection between the mind, the feeling, the body, and how they're all interrelated. And so this is part of the investigations that we do. And so this is kind of an interesting thing, is that people will try to practice Anapanasati step 1, 2, 3, and then 4. By doing like Goenka has them doing, the body scanning. Every Goenka retreat, as far as I know, step 3 through day 10 is scanning. All right. They're just staying there on step 3 of Anapanasati. Where do they ever teach how to relax the body? They don't. Oh yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** So they don't really go into— that would be 4, right?

**Speaker A:** The relaxation of the body. Ah, but if you recognize it, because there is a sutta that, by the way, does not have 5 factors for the first Jhana, it has 6. It adds an additional one, and that is the relaxation of the body. It's not normally in the first 5, but when you add that as an aspect to it, that means it all. As we're actually practicing the skill and developing the skill of Piti, Sukkha, and also the gladdening of the mind, that takes care of much of the first Jhana in the sense of freedom from the hindrance through the gladdening of the mind and also the Piti and the Sukkha. And then the next parts are being able to apply this over and over and over again. In other words, keep bringing the mind out of the unwholesome. That's the unremitting Sati and the unremitting investigation. And then the unremitting effort is not effort anymore. Now it's actually used as unremitting energy because we've already got our enthusiasm, we got our mojo going. Okay, as well as we've got some skills going in there, or we've got that attitude change. And the attitude— here's a clear example of that— is that the mom tells her teenage son, there's a lot of garbage in the kitchen, go clean it up and take it out. He does, but it takes a while and it's an effort. Now the second story is this teenage kid walks into the kitchen someday and he sees a bunch of garbage there and he says, hot dog, mom would be really happy if I cleaned that up. He picks all of that stuff, he takes it out to the trash. Now which one was the more effort, the one when he didn't want to do it or the time when he actually wanted to do it?

**Speaker B:** Well, absolutely the time when he wanted to do it, right? That— or sorry, yeah, yeah, all right,

**Speaker A:** well that's right, effort. The right is wanting to do it happen, and then it's not so much effort anymore.

**Speaker B:** You have the enthusiasm, right?

**Speaker A:** And exactly, that's what's built right into the package. And actually, that's mentioned in another sutta, number 48, is that enthusiasm, that eagerness for the Dharma. And so eager for the practice of the Dharma, I would say, is even as important as eager for didactic information about the Dharma. Practicing it. So this is where that eagerness comes in that makes it really effortless. Or, oh, well, I got nothing else to do now that I recognize that I, you know, now that I woke up.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, exactly. Where it's like, oh, it's It's like the practice too is like a joy within itself, right? Like just, you know, coming back to it. It's not like some grim task or something, and I need to do this so that one day I, you know, do get enlightened or something.

**Speaker A:** Like, isn't that— but that one point is such a major change in attitude. The loser has the attitude of, look how hard I tried and look how hard I've got to try. May I please have my reward someday? Thank you, sir. Because you're the boss and I'm just an Anagami. All right. And changing that attitude of, hey boy, look at this, we got that one.

**Speaker D:** Haha.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah. Yeah, that's, that's it too. Like with spotting the hindrances on that sort of point where you do spot them, having that attitude as well of the congratulations of the like, you're almost having that reaction of Piti of the aha, I see you, Mara, right? It gladdens the mind along with that. So you're spotting it and you're gladdening, right? So when you do catch yourself kind of drifting into something, it's like, oh wait, oh, no problem, because it's already working, right? Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly. And we didn't know that until you know, this little piece of information, look at what you're doing. That's what I think, that that was the one that did it for me with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, because I asked him one time, actually, in the sense of Vipassana and sitting and all that, he says— I said, there's a poem in English, and that is, if at first you don't succeed, try, try again. I said, "Okay, well that's the Vipassana, that practice, that's the Western Mahayana, that's it." And he chuckled and he says, "No, if you first don't succeed, look at what you're doing." And that is such a jaw-dropper, I mean, he hit me with that, and that was I think the change in the point in time when I began to understand what all of this is about. Is that we're not trying to gain something. We're looking at what's going on instead. And so the noting takes on a completely different quality now because of that whole idea of gladdening the mind. I think another reason why it's often missing is because anybody who's written a book on Anapanasati almost always follows the format that the sutta lays out. And the Sutta 118 actually follows the plan of Sutra number 10, the knock-knock Satipatthana Sutta. And the Satipatthana Sutta would naturally be laid out in the order that it was laid out in ancient times of hard ground first, then water, and then fire, and then air. Mainly fire before air is because fire happens and then smoke rises into the air. Would be the reason why the ancients would have had it that way.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Which is exactly what happens. In fact, there's a song about it. When your heart's on fire, burning with desire, smoke gets in your eyes. Platters, 1953. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I was like I feel like I've heard that one, but at the same time I'm like, have I? It sounded familiar. Yeah, yeah, no, that's interesting that how it— yeah, they're like laid out in

**Speaker C:** the

**Speaker B:** Satipatthana, the foundations of mindfulness, like they actually align with the elements there, right? So again, like the body was the body is like the, um, right, the earth, right, right. And then the feelings— was that the fire?

**Speaker A:** Yes, feeling. Feelings, Vedana, is the water. Yeah, those feelings are fluid. I mean, and they make us work and they make the body move up and down and all of that. That they could— the ancients could see that, that there is some lit— and in fact, uh, when you drain the blood out of somebody, the body dies. I mean, this is old ancient literature.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay. Oh, so yeah, that was— so that, yeah, it was the, um— so there's

**Speaker A:** the body, there's the fluid or the feelings.

**Speaker B:** Oh, so that's fluid, right? And then the, the mind was, um, mind of fire. Fire. So the mind was fire. Okay. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And then, uh, uh, Ajahn Thanissaro's book on, um, uh, what is the name of it? Something like mind of fire or mind on fire. The book has a title, has, uh, Mind on Fire.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And also the Buddha goes back to the point of, uh, burning by day and smoldering by night. Smoldering refers to dreaming. Okay. So yeah, mental fire. And we still use that reference today. Is it? I'm all fired up.

**Speaker C:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no, that makes sense. Yeah. And then the— is it the Dharmas, right? The fourth foundation? That would be air then.

**Speaker A:** Well, in this sense, yes. Which means everything around us.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so, okay, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And in ancient times, they had a little trouble with what was air, what was breathing, what was loss of breath, what is this stuff, okay? That in fact, you know, the word atmosphere, that is actually out of an ancient Greek word, atmos, and it's not the same word as atom, A-T-O-M.

**Speaker C:** M-O

**Speaker A:** and A-T-O-M are not the same word. The reason I'm bringing this up is because atom actually was a word invented by the Greeks as something that's not cuttable. That is not the word that the Buddha used for anatta. It's a different word. He used the word for atmosphere, that, okay, because in the ancient times they thought that the atmosphere was alive. And not only that, but each one of us, because of that air, we are permanently alive. Okay. That we're— the soul is in the air. All right. The— I've been actually to the Burning Hats and Arahant, right on the Ganges, where the poor stand in line with their little bits of money and the rich one, his family negotiates for the loss of all the land. Because in fact, the problem is it doesn't matter who you are, they want everything you've got. To get it, that they don't even use enough wood, literally they don't use enough wood to do a full cremation. So they have to— yeah. Oh, hi, Doug.

**Speaker C:** Oh, welcome.

**Speaker D:** I just saw you were on, so I thought I'd step in for a second.

**Speaker A:** I'm glad to see you. We were just talking about Varanasi in India, where they have the burning huts, and that I was there and watched them do the cremations. They had 8, 9, 10, 11 guys in this one area, each Anagami, no, not guys, but burning areas, and that with piles of wood kind of in the background. But they would always do things like break the legs at the kneecaps and fold the feet over because the feet hadn't gotten burned because there was not enough fire to burn the whole body. So eventually, after it got cooked enough, they would break the legs and pull those over. But always in every case, very much later towards the end of it, after they rearranged and broke the legs and stuff like that, a lot of pus and snot and steam would start to come out of the nose

**Speaker D:** because the

**Speaker A:** brains are now boiling of the corpse, not the guy who is holding— I mean, it's not the Brahmin who's doing that, the corpse. Will be so well cooked, the brains are starting to boil. And so bubbles of snot and all kinds of stuff start coming out of the nose. Oh, man. This is the point in time when they get their Brahman-blessed shillelaghs out, dance around the corpse, parading with this thing. And then after all the chanting, they will take it and crack it open really hard with this right and crack the skull open to let all of the boiling stuff come out in a great big cloud of smoke and brain manure and all kinds of stuff. I mean, it's quite a splashing that comes out.

**Speaker D:** And good, I haven't had my breakfast yet.

**Speaker A:** I'm sorry, what?

**Speaker D:** Well, good thing I haven't had my breakfast yet.

**Speaker A:** Well, the point is, is that that steam and smoke and all of that was the Brahman's way of releasing the soul back into the atmosphere, sending it home. Okay, that's the background of that stuff. And all of that was happening at the time of the Buddha, and some of it is still going on exactly the way that it did then for the same kind of reasons or whatnot. The burning house of Varanasi are old, old things. And so, um, this— the Buddha is saying there is no atman, which actually what he's saying is that there is no soul, that everything is temporary. There is nothing permanent about anyone that's being a burned up, consumed with fire, or cremated in Varanasi, that all of that smoke or boiling liquid that is busted out of the skull by getting it cracked open is for profit and for show, but not for the benefit of the corpse.

**Speaker D:** Yeah. And then again, then again, at least from our own direct experience, we see

**Speaker A:** that

**Speaker D:** like when you have a dead body that's just lying there in the woods or something, whatever it is, it gets kind of repurposed. So in a way, it doesn't— that what it's made of doesn't disappear, but the form that used to be there won't be recognized.

**Speaker A:** But just because that corpse mostly went up in smoke doesn't mean that it's lost too, that all of that stuff that you would have buried in one place is now going to be floating all over the the place it'll eventually land.

**Speaker D:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** and there all those minerals are, and no problem.

**Speaker C:** I appreciate this. This is like a charnel ground contemplation, um, in the Satipatthana, you know, when they say, oh yeah, in this bag is, uh, hair, blood, mucus.

**Speaker A:** Drew, you caught me! You caught me at it. Yes, this is exactly the stuff that's in

**Speaker D:** this Anapanasati Pitana Sutta.

**Speaker C:** This is interesting because we don't get to do this anymore, and maybe that's actually— no, I'm not sure that's such a good thing. I was actually speaking to a medical student, and if you're not a medical student, it turns out it's really difficult to have access to a dead body and just being able to see one.

**Speaker A:** Goenka had a video. In fact, it was one of the very few videos. VCRs were very rare in India back in '70s, and so were the videos. And so we saw that video a lot on an autopsy. Okay, so the point I'm making here is, is that autopsies are available on YouTube. And my favorite autopsy is actually out of a movie, and the autopsy doctor is actually Mel Brooks. Do you know who is Mel Brooks?

**Speaker C:** He's an actor from the olden times, right?

**Speaker A:** Right. He, in fact, he does, uh, comedies. And the movie is, um, Dead and Loving It. Leslie Nielsen did, did that as the vampire. But, uh, he did a, a short autopsy where he goes in and cuts the thing open, usually with a knife, rips it out, and several of the people, um, fall and faint. And then he grabs the heart and he starts pulling like that and pumping it and looking around as several more students faint. And then he chops the head open, pulls the brain out and starts pulling that in people's faces. And the whole rest of the student body standing around faint. He drops that brain down and he says, my job's done here. And I mean, yeah, show them the gore. The name of the movie? Dead and Loving It. Okay, it's actually that one scene, Dead and Loving It, and the autopsy scene. You can actually YouTube that. It's on YouTube. I actually sent that around to some of my students.

**Speaker D:** I mean, it's one thing with human corpses, but in general, coming upon death isn't that hard. When you take a walk in the woods, you will likely have the opportunity to find some dead bodies.

**Speaker A:** I know I have seen a dog. In fact, it was in a particular town. Never mind any of the details. This dog died in that place and stayed there and no one picked it up. It was on the side of the road. And my friend went and took a photo every day of what was going on. And one of the things that I saw when I was there with it was is that the dogs would go and pay attention to that dog, take a smell, see what was going on, and just boogie on down the road. Didn't give a flying pip at all. But humans, even with a dead dog, would freak out.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, that's an interesting psychological phenomenon.

**Speaker A:** Fear of death.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay. So if we're going to get over our fear, as in, in fact, if we're going to develop Sukkha and Anapanasati, perhaps one of the ways of doing it is getting over our own fear of death by going and seeing what it is. That in fact, I greatly appreciate the fact that when I was a monk in the United States, mostly in North Carolina, but I've done funerals all over the place. I don't know how many I did, but it looked like we were doing one a week for years or two a week sometimes. That's what we did on the weekends is we went to funerals. What did you do on your weekends?

**Speaker D:** And that's a nice way of partying, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Party? What?

**Speaker D:** It's a pretty nice way of partying.

**Speaker A:** Yes, right. Well, we got to see all the monks. That in fact, Maha Samsara was the coordinator, and that in the sense that there was often more than one funeral in the state. On that weekend, and we had to get the monks of who's going to, which monks are going to go to where. And since we were already living with Maha Samsara, he already had had us assigned to go to some funeral or another. And I've been to Vietnamese and Laos and Cambodian, Thai, all kinds of places going for funerals. And one of the things that I added to it was instead of— because I saw that Ajahn Maha Samsara, he would do the chanting because that's what all of the old people were wanting the monks to do. But the younger ones often needed attention and solace. And I remember generally the point was, is that if this is an old man who's dying, who has a son, or a grandson, if he's really, really old, he's got a papa, but there's a grandson then that's at that age, that while we're doing the funeral chant and I'm holding his hand to push the button to fire this cremation machine off, that's that point in time. That's the, you know, the point of absolute no return. Hello, Marcus. Good to see you.

**Speaker E:** Hi, everybody. Hi, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** We're having a funeral.

**Speaker E:** For who? For ourselves?

**Speaker A:** No, as a learning experience for a meditator or a Dhamma dude of learning to deal with death by getting around it rather than avoiding it. That, you know, go look in your local newspaper for upcoming funerals and go.

**Speaker C:** Really?

**Speaker A:** Yeah. If they'll let you into the basement of the hospital, go have a party. And because of COVID there's probably a dozen or so pickup trucks with bodies laying in the back of the hospital already. All you have to do is get the body bag open.

**Speaker E:** You know, I've heard stories about people going to funerals just for the food and everything.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's another reason, but Dharma dudes, they have a show.

**Speaker D:** But there is also certain yogic traditions that are, I think, those that are like a bit more about the whole Kali stuff that actually do like corpse meditations and stuff and have very sophisticated, elaborate instructions on how and what kind of corpse to obtain for these kinds of practices and shit.

**Speaker A:** I think some of those things are really ancient too. This is not new. They were doing that kind of stuff in the time of the Buddha. That's probably why he incorporated the charnel ground meditations into his practice with the monks. That is, a lot of what the Buddha did already existed. He just put a bunch of stuff together. Even the Four Noble Truths, he attributes to Arya Vedic medicine. And he had a whole lot of medical doctors who were trained in the Ayurvedic medicine of the ancients who were his Bhikkhus. They quit being doctors and come hung out. So it's very familiar. The whole, whole predicate of Ayurvedic medicine is based upon what's the illness, what's the cause, what's it like when the illness is finished, and what medication do we prescribe to get him into the state that he wants to be in.

**Speaker C:** Wait, hang on.

**Speaker A:** Which— that's the Four Noble Truths.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, no, definitely. I've heard this said before. Symptoms, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment is one way of looking at the Four Noble Truths, which I'm just curious about this Ayurvedic thing. Like, where does it— like, is it in a sutta somewhere, or is it—

**Speaker A:** I read it in a book someplace in India, and that's all that I can tell you.

**Speaker C:** But yeah, I like that way of phrasing it. It's a good way of— what'd you call it? It's probably one of my favorite ways of framing it to people because it gets them in the problem-solving mindset.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's the whole point of it. Or better still, way of instead of being in a problem problem-solving mindset is to get them into 'there is no problem' mindset. That we have been habitually stuck in a problem-solving mindset, and we go around problem problems all the time. In fact, one of the jokes is, is that what happens to a problem solver when he runs out of problems to solve? And his whole identity is, is he's the problem solver. The answer is he's just got a new problem. The problem is I don't have any problems, and so I got to go find a problem. When I find it, now I've got a problem that I can— How many of us are like that? We get into the habit of being problem solvers, and even when we don't have a problem, we go looking for one.

**Speaker D:** Guilty as charged.

**Speaker C:** Uh-huh.

**Speaker A:** So I have a question.

**Speaker C:** Um, there seems to be this tension between what I have to, uh, because a friend of mine, a meditator friend of mine, said, you know, the ordinary, you know, what was it, the material world is very good for things like food, shelter, clothing, and certain stuff. And, uh, he was just reminding me that Though I was talking about my practice and how it was going, that I still have responsibilities and things that I need to take care of in this world, even though they may not be the Noble Dharma. There's still a lot of ordinary Dharma that I need to carry out.

**Speaker A:** If you do those things with a mind that's noble, then those things are noble. And if you do those things with a mind that's not noble, then here's an example of that. If the old goatherd, who is also a rabbi, who is the one in the village who is charged with and has the responsibility of killing this next goat, and he approaches that goat with a mind that's noble, he won't kill it. He'll say, wait a while until my mind is no longer noble, and then I'll do the dirty deed.

**Speaker C:** But going back to the problem-solving thing, it's almost required of me in doing ordinary tasks to see something, fix it, move on, think about it, etc., etc.

**Speaker A:** Samsara.

**Speaker C:** And then when I have to— when I— not when I have to— when I choose to, um, sit down to practice, sometimes I'm able to remind myself, oh, I don't need to untangle these knots anymore. They're just like— they're just fine as they are. And sometimes I'm able to remember that. And sometimes I don't wake up, and if I wake up, I don't take a proper look. To, and then I see the knot and I think that, oh, I need to like untangle this rather than just like, oh no, it's fine, just let it be.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, that's kind of switching back and forth.

**Speaker C:** Is—

**Speaker A:** let's, let's put this in context in the sense of doing it when you're off by yourself doing what many people will call a formal practice. Are you doing this shooting from the hip up while you're out there in the world dodging the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. Those are two different things because we want to get away from it all, all those slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, so we can actually begin to practice getting all of those slings and arrows actually out of the mind.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so getting ourselves into a really good mood and then in a good mood practicing going back into the actual slings and arrows and how long can we maintain that good mood? And maybe as soon as we lose it, if we've got mindfulness at that point, we can still withdraw from the battlefield wounded and go heal ourselves again. And then in that regard, that's like picking yourself up, dusting yourself off, and let's go back into the fray.

**Speaker C:** I guess my point is that it almost seems like, I very much see the advantages of a retreat now because you just got that set amount of time, whereas here you're getting dirty and then, or you're falling off and you're picking back up, falling off, picking back up, falling off, picking back up again and again and again. And there's nothing inherently wrong with that, but it is, uh, I feel like it takes more effort. And you, that momentum, that attitude, um seems to be a little bit slower to build.

**Speaker A:** Yes, in fact, you're right. It does take more effort simply because there's more slings and arrows of outrageous fortune coming at you.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So if you can get away from it all, literally, then the only slings and arrows of outrageous fortune are the ones that you're stabbing yourself with. And here's an interesting point with that, and that is, is that it's well known in these 10-day retreats that the first day or two The students are still worried about the past in the sense of how they got there and all the trouble they had to get to the retreat and how much it cost and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And right at the end of the retreat, the only thing that the students think about is how they're going to get out of here, where they're going to go, what's their transportation and all of that kind of stuff. And so they only have a few days in the middle to actually pay attention to what are we doing in the retreat. And in that regard, the question— the answer would be that, hey guys, on the first day of the retreat, or hopefully before you even go into the retreat, you got to know that, hey, you can start the retreat right now. You don't have to wait until the mind drains out all of the slings and arrows that you brought in there from the past day and week.

**Speaker C:** I actually— gosh. I realized this last time I went on retreat. I made the mistake of watching a Harry Potter movie the day before.

**Speaker A:** And there you got Harry Potter flying around the insides of your mind.

**Speaker C:** It was fantastic, Dhammarato. I cannot tell you. I think it was Saturday evening I watched Harry Potter, and then one of the sats either on the first day or the second day, it wasn't just— I only watched one Harry Potter movie, but one of the sats, one of the hours, I went through the entire like 7 books, 8 movies in my head. I wasn't even mad, I was just like, okay, cool, I need to know not to do this next time. I need to clear out my mind before I get on retreat.

**Speaker A:** Well, So, we can say, in one regard, congratulations for sitting through the whole sequence and doing it pretty cheaply. I mean, if you'd have done that every day in a movie theater, it would have been quite expensive. So, congratulations for saving yourself some money and maybe even some time, if that was what the point of the meditation retreat was. But if you had something else, on your mind, about getting stuff off your mind, then maybe it would have been a better practice. And so this is the suggestion is the next time you go to retreat, everybody who goes to retreat, go with the idea that this is the best holiday I've ever had. Yeah, I've got no place to go and nothing to do, and the bell is not my boss. And I'm here just to chill.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And every time I'm stopped chilling, I can see that and turn that around too. And so we're just practicing being chilled for 10 days, and wow, it is just so amazing. Go ahead, Doug.

**Speaker D:** I've got a question. You mentioned the term outrageous fortunes. What do you mean by that?

**Speaker A:** Oh, I think this is slang from Shakespeare, and the quote is, "Slings and arrows of outrageous fortune." Now, what the word fortune here is not a big pile of money, but it's rather your fate or what happens to you. That's where the word happiness comes from, is that it's just a happening. Okay, so you could rephrase that as the slings and arrows that just happen by.

**Speaker D:** Yeah. So the stuff that every day that happens every day, which you may or may not like, which you have no control over whatsoever.

**Speaker A:** No control over whatsoever until we start recognizing how much control we have of standing out of the way and not letting those slings and arrows hit us. But we do not have any control over the slings and arrows other than to see them coming soon enough in advance so that they don't whack us. Now, the other point is that they're not outrageous until they do whack us. And when we do get hit with it, we feel like this is an outrage.

**Speaker D:** And they only whack us when we're not looking, right?

**Speaker A:** When we're not paying attention.

**Speaker D:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** in other words, the thing of it is, is like some big guy stood up on the elevator— or excuse me, on the escalator— and stepped on your foot. Okay, that's one of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune if you don't like it. But if you're mindful, if you're watching what's going, just as he begins to step right on your foot, you just happen to move it just enough to get it out of the way.

**Speaker C:** This is a thing I was trying to explain to a friend. I'd started meditating, you know, formally, a lot, like, you know, and they were asking for, okay, how does that change your life? And I was trying— it was really hard.

**Speaker A:** You don't get stepped on. That's how it changes your life.

**Speaker C:** Basically, yes. It was really hard to explain. It's like, I can't give you any positive benefits because you don't— like, At some point, initially you have to put in the effort, but then it becomes a habit and it becomes a wholesome habit and you don't realize the arrows that you even kind of subconsciously stepped out of the way of almost.

**Speaker A:** But it was the arrows that we let hit us. By the way, this fits in really, really well with the sutta I think is number 64 in the Majjhima Nikaya. Where the Buddha talks about somebody actually getting shot with an arrow as a metaphor, and his friend saw it. And so they go in to get a doctor, and the doctor comes up and about to put the salve on it and getting ready to take the arrow out. And the guy says, wait a minute, before you take the arrow out, I want to know who shot me. I want to know why he shot me. I want to know what clan he's from. Let me look at this arrow to where I can see where it comes from. You know. And the Buddha then says, if you have that attitude, you will probably die asking questions before you take the arrow out. The right thing to do is to stop asking questions, stop trying to figure stuff out, and take the arrow out if you're already hit. That's the whole thing, is to take— and in that regard, you can say that in this case, the arrow is actually just an unwholesome thought that's in the mind. And what is that unwholesome thought? Well, this unwholesome thought was probably triggered by something that someone said, like, you're too critical, you're too fat, you're too ugly, you're a bully. I mean, I've been having a long list of things that I've had to dodge.

**Speaker D:** Guys, I gotta go get some breakfast in. It was nice talking to you. Have a good one.

**Speaker A:** All right, Dag, that's great.

**Speaker E:** Bye, Dag.

**Speaker B:** Bye.

**Speaker A:** So we can actually get back into that connection between Anapanasati Sutta and the Great Forty. In the sense of the Anapanasati Sutra's Seven Factors of Enlightenment show the sequence of events, and also so does the Eightfold Noble Path, the way that it's taught in the Great Pali, and that is mindfulness and investigation and the right effort to change it. Doing that over and over again builds up the right attitude or the right expectation or something that seems in our language would be pre-verbal or pre-thought. It's a niggle or an indication that in fact that attitude or that niggle or that indication is what gives rise to the dialogue of the thought. And that dialogue of the thought then is what makes us feel bad. In other words, we perceive danger, and what we can begin to do is to see these little niggles giving thought, giving, almost bypassing the verbal thought so that it actually is a niggle that there is some danger followed immediately by fear without us having to even talk ourselves into it. So this is that point then where we begin to see that we have a control over this. And that's why the Buddha actually puts these Jhana factors right there as aspects of the Anapanasati Sutta, Piti and Sukkha. Let's come out of these bad feelings that we have that are generated through the attitude of something is dangerous and start talking ourselves into nothing is dangerous here. Everything is okay. There are no problems to solve. There's no place to go. Everything is hunky-dory. Wow, we can relax. And that's then the beginning of the feeling because we're talking ourselves into it. And as we relax and feel relaxed, we begin then to that attitude change of, wow, I could do this. And so that's step 5 and 6 of Anapanasati. Now, the reason that it's in the sutta in the order that it is, is because in Pali language, there is a word called Piti, Sukkha, It's just one word and it's used often, and generally they try to translate it individually as each one rather than having it as its own oxymoron or its own word. So piti sukha is actually a combination of Piti and Sukkha, but it's in almost as if it's the same thing, but that there are degrees of it. So that both of them have the quality of safety, security, and comfort and satisfaction. But then Piti— excuse me, yeah, satisfaction— and then Piti adds the extra ingredient of success. We did it! We got it! Okay, that kind of feeling. That is, in fact, what they're trying to describe in the sutras about what is Piti. They're giving that physical reaction of energy coming up the back, the feeling of strength and power that actually exudes in physical form in many cases. But then it relaxes even to more just a mental feeling of strong well-being. We've got it made. We can do this. Is confidence. This is the Pali word, by the way, of Saddha or Shraddha— confidence, but not faith. It's translated out of the Pali in English into the word faith, and it misses the point. This is not faith, this is direct experience over and over and over, gaining confidence.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, when you see it like that, that's really important.

**Speaker A:** This is why it's such a bad translation. Yeah, there is so much that has to do with the translation, like Samadhi doesn't mean concentration, it means gathering the factors together. But it's wrong, concentration, right? So if you're going to have the Samatha of first Jhana, that means that you have to have all the factors together. And one of the factors is a gladdened mind or a mind that's free from hindrances, Piti, Sukkha, applying the mind to these wholesome things and sustaining it on there. And then the 6th ingredient is, and do all of this relaxed. And there we go all through the Anapanasati Sutta. You see, we're touching by talking about 1st Jhana. We're actually touching all the keynotes on the piano of Anapanasati. And I think that that's just so brilliant. That Anapanasati is using the Eightfold Noble Path to get the mind into first Jhana. And then what do we do? Well, now we're going to do the noting or the investigation, but now we only have wholesome things to note and to investigate, like how is my Sukkha, how is my Piti, how is my investigation, it? How is my applied mind? Can I keep applying it back to the Dhamma? Can I keep sustaining it back to the Dharma over and over again? And so actually what we're investigating now that we're into First Jhana is the factors of First Jhana. Isn't that crazy? Except that When we're in the first jhana and we take the attention off of the applied and sustained thought and give no thought to the thought at all, but really start paying attention to how good we feel, that's the second jhana, is really paying attention to how good we can feel when we've talked ourselves into it. And then that relaxes into the third jhana. So the hallmark of the investigation of first jhana is to investigate first the first jhana, then to really reinvestigate Piti, and then investigate Sukkha. And when we're investigating Sukkha, that's the third jhana. And then when we start to investigate the relationships with all of this, that's the fourth jhana. That's when we're really relaxed and the mind's really super sharp. Sharp and can see what's going on. But these are ordinary states. These are not magical states, guys. This is just hallmarks, or I'm giving the directions that I'm giving is for ordinary states of mind. The question is, how long can you sustain them? Well, the way the answer to that is we practice sustaining it with the first Jhana. Let's say the the bottom line or the foundation for the investigation of the— say that. But now we're into the Paticcasamuppada in the sense of everything is arising and passing away, which is actually now the core of Anapanasati. So basically the way that it looks like is that when we get the Satipatthana going, we do it in the sense of getting the the body, the feelings, and the mind together into first Jhana. So now we can properly investigate the Dhamma and Upadana, the arising and the passing away of everything, the arising and passing away of everything. What the answer is, the arising and the passing away of everything is wholesome because everything is wholesome right now, which means the arising and the passing away moment by moment of the Jhana so that when we're paying attention to the applied thought, we're not paying attention to the Piti or the Sukkha. When we're paying attention to the Piti, we're no longer into the thoughts, they have passed away. When we go into the Sukkha very deeply, that means that we're letting the Piti, the thrill, go away and the relaxation take over. And so the arising and the passing away, and we go from state to state, and an arising and a passing away, and we begin to watch that process too. Everything is temporary depending upon what I'm paying attention to. If I keep changing my attention, every— my whole world changes as the attention changes. And now we're in a state to where everything that I have to look at is all wholesome. Whipped it too. So that's the kind of way of looking at the integration of the Anapanasati and the Paticcasamuppada and the Eightfold Noble Path and the Seven Factors of Enlightenment and the Satipatthana and all those subside things like the Five Aggregates, they all fit into a nice little package. They're all just one thing. But when young students start studying all of this, it looks like a massive amount of literature to follow. Fall through on, rather than by just simply practicing correctly. There's only really a few things that we need to practice. If we practice correctly, we could just see how all that stuff fits together instead of trying to figure it out before we start to practice. So it all comes together back into a unified whole again. Everything about the Buddhist teaching is all about unity.

**Speaker C:** So, I mean, I'm convinced that this is a reasonable way to go because having tried it, I do much prefer— I do much prefer being a wholesome— sorry, having a wholesome nurturing mind. And I don't really care— well, I don't really care as much. Like, I see that this is the important thing and you know, whatever fruits of meditation and attainments or whatever, like if you're satisfied, those will come. But what do you— how do you respond to those people who say that this is the slow path and you don't need to worry about Jhana, you just start noting, noting, noting?

**Speaker A:** All right, let us say that two different competing restaurants of approximately the same size start off in the beginning of the evening's cooking meal. They're both clean.

**Speaker C:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And that one has a manager that says, never mind the mess you make, you keep cooking food. And the other manager of the other restaurant says, as you cook, clean up after yourself. Now, in the beginning of the evening, the team who is just letting things go and be sloppy, they're actually actually being able to cook more food. But over time, as the mess piles up, they're going to have to slow down just because they want to stop getting the garbage that they had from the last meal mixed in with the food that they're trying to pretend to cook now. And the counter is messy. Nobody's wiped off anything. The knives are dirty and it affects the food. So, which do you think is the better way to go, is for people when they're working in the kitchen to clean up their mess as they go, or to let the mess pile up? Drew?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I mean, obviously, I do this in my own kitchen, I clean up as I go, so this is how I do it. I mean, I know that some people don't do this, and I find this very difficult to work with, uh, very difficult to cook with. But yeah, I clean up as I go the best I can. You know, sometimes there's a big mess and that's fine, but if I can, I clean up before I eat, just a little bit, just putting the dishes in the sink, making sure that things— there's enough space for the next bit.

**Speaker A:** Oh, actually, what I'm— I'm kind of telling a joke because that first kind of restaurant, nobody has that kind of restaurant. Everybody, when they're slicing tomatoes, if there's a little piece of the tomato like the top of it or whatever, then the bin is right there. They want to pick that piece up and throw it in the bin, and they're finished with it. They're cleaning up as they go. But in our daily lives, that's— we leave that job to sleep alone. That is sleep and dream's job to do the cleanup of the mess And often we don't wake up with a clean kitchen of a mind.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I think that happened to me this morning. You know how you say sometimes you feel like a nut and sometimes you don't?

**Speaker A:** Exactly so. But what we could do with that is that we could develop this practice of intentionally cleaning the mind, intentionally gladdening the mind, intentionally practicing Anapanasati. And intentionally do a scrub job from time to time, right in the middle of dinner. We can just say, wait a minute.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I'm good to go now.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I think I'm going to try. Okay, I'm making a strong intention or a strong attitude I'll try doing that more often throughout the day, like a proper deep clean, but you know, it doesn't have to take long.

**Speaker A:** It doesn't have to take long at all. No, 10-15 seconds is all you need.

**Speaker C:** Because that thing that I mentioned earlier of, well, I have to do things in the ordinary world, but it makes it harder to, you know, you're just falling off and getting back up, falling off and getting back up more often.

**Speaker A:** Exactly right. So in fact, when you do fall off and recognize that you fall off, take 5. 5 seconds and get back up and

**Speaker C:** dust yourself off instead of leaving it to formal practice. Which, I mean, I can manage it, but it's a lot harder.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's where Sati comes in, is we have to remember to take 5 when the boss just hit us with an arrow. Instead of, you know, arguing with him about why he shot us, We could take five and clean it out and figure out that it wasn't an arrow he shot us with at all. That was our belief system, that he was shooting slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, when in fact he may have just been walking by saying hi.

**Speaker B:** I wanted to add, I think, to Dhammarato, is the sort of mentality of like when you remember to has helped me a lot because there's that thing like, oh, I need to do this all the time, or you know what I mean? It becomes like another rule.

**Speaker A:** And it's like you're going to— I've seen people carry rule lists around. Oh, you're supposed to do this and you're supposed to do that. That keeps us upset and uptight comparing ourselves against a set of standards that we're carrying around. And now we're recognizing that, hey, man, We can set the standards so low that I'm automatically passing the grade.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So it's just like, oh, when you remember, it's like, oh, how wonderful it is that I remembered the breath, not, oh no, I forgot. Why wasn't I mindful 5 minutes ago, right?

**Speaker E:** There's a great sutta about that. I can't remember which one it is. I always forget the numbers. However, it's the one where the Buddha is asking a group of monks, it's like, which one is— and how they should— they're asking the monks how they should remember the breath or remember how to breathe well. One says, oh, if you breathe every— if you breathe well every— if you remember to breathe once every day or something like that, good with mindfulness, then it isn't a day wasted or something like that. And then the next monk says, oh, if I remember to take a good breath and remember the breath every minute, 'Okay, that's good,' and it goes, it keeps on going on like that until the last monk says, 'Oh, if I can remember this very breath right now.' Yeah, yeah, and that's good because if you do remember the breath, it's always going to be now.

**Speaker A:** This one, this one.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, this one,

**Speaker C:** this one. And if you're good about it, you're

**Speaker A:** not going to beat yourself up about

**Speaker E:** it because there it is.

**Speaker B:** I think I'm talking to— I know

**Speaker A:** about that sutra, but I do also not remember the number on it. It's in the Samyutta someplace, but I don't remember.

**Speaker E:** I think that's a good one. I like that one.

**Speaker C:** Unpack a little bit because that conclusion, that punchline was a bit too quick for me. I'll try to find it for you, Drew.

**Speaker A:** Oh, it is basically it's moving from a time frame oriented more and more often until it gets down to the last monk, number 4 or 5 or something on the list, where he says this breath. That's the one the Buddha is talking about, not one a day. But if you remember it just once a day, at least you're remembering it that one time. That's a now. You remembered it. That's what we're doing here. Okay. So this is actually then the point here is the development of Sati. When do you do it? When you remember to do it. That's the point of that sutra. Mudita, that we don't plan on it in advance, we just do it when we remember to do it. Now, so Drew or Marcus, if you can dig that one up, we'll post it with the video. David, yes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I was going to add, I think too, with the mindfulness of breathing, right, the in and the out breaths, like that really helps with it because is in order to discern whether it's an in or an out breath, like you have to be here now, right? Like that kind of helps.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there's even a little bit more to it in the sense that it mentions in the sutta mindful to— or, and we're talking about Sati now, mindfulness, or actually pay attention, and in this case kind of control that this is a long deep in-breath.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that is— this is a long deep out-breath. Death, but that has that intention to it that is discussed in other places that we act. One of the ways that I say it in English language is we got to have some skin in the game. We got to put some effort into this.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, having like the long deep breaths. Yeah, no, definitely helps to have the skin in the game and to be involved with it. For sure. Yeah, I have found that.

**Speaker A:** And it helps us pay attention also to the point that part of the outcome of this is to get the body really relaxed, really comfortable, as opposed to what we see in Western meditation of sitting long hours that you're supposed to endure sensations and pain and get a tough attitude because you can handle the pain. Pain rather than getting a tough attitude, because you know how to avoid pain rather than tough it out. And how do you do that? It's by being relaxed. Hey, if your arm hurts when you move it in that direction, don't move it in that direction. It's trying to send you a message. I'm thinking most specifically the arm that had a cast in it, and every time that you try to do— I mean, teenagers are like this. It takes really a hard time for the bones to because the kids won't leave the hands free. If a right-handed kid at the age of 14 breaks his right arm, he will not do what the doctors tell him unless the doctors strap his arm down so he cannot use that hand. Because while he's using the hand, he's moving all of that stuff in the arm, keeping it from being able to heal. And he keeps complaining about how much his arm hurts, and if he'd leave it alone, it would be okay.

**Speaker C:** Rest.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and we need also to do that for everything, that everything needs exercising and rest, and exercising and rest. But oftentimes within our society, it's exercise, exercise, exercise. The more you do, the more you get, over and over and over again. Without taking that reward of resting. We don't even know how to rest.

**Speaker B:** There's not that rest, that release. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that rest that we're talking about, that relief, that calmness that the Buddha is talking about, uh, the words that he uses become magical. Like the word Nibbana. The word Nibbana only means to chill, baby, cool off. Well, settle down, relax. But somehow or another it's got magical qualities that it's a city or it's after death or it's all kinds of, you know, a heaven, a place to go, rather than merely just chilling. So this is what we need to do, is that yes, we're not saying don't have any intents. Efforts or whatever, we're saying, oh, every time that you get hit by any of that intensity, the sling or the arrow of the outrageous fortune, this is the moment of time to relax

**Speaker C:** and

**Speaker A:** take that arrow out. What arrow? The arrow of the mind of, oh, I didn't like what happened just now. Let's get that healing process so you come back to— oh yeah, I can handle that too. Yeah, I see what the boss is pointing at and I don't have to feel bad. Yeah, I really screwed that one up. Let's fix it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. There isn't like that thing where it kicks in so much with it. I mean, that's the survival thing as well, right? Of that like, oh, I need to protect myself, and so if they criticize me for this and that and all the other things But you're exactly right

**Speaker A:** with your language, listen to what you said, "You have to protect yourself," ta-da!

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Because the organism, the human body is going to be fine sitting there, there is no lynch mob coming for you, there are no alligators there, so the body will survive, the question is, will the self survive this disaster? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Guess what? Yeah, it will, but it'll feel really wounded. And so, can you get unwounded in a hurry? If you get wounded, can you get unwounded in a hurry? That's where we need Anapanasati, right there in front of the boss. Take a deep breath. This too shall pass. Never mind, I can handle this. Oh yeah, boss, I see what you're talking about.

**Speaker C:** And sometimes I guess, yeah, I was just thinking that like, I guess maybe it's worth mentioning. I know I feel like sometimes you forget or sometimes, you know, but you're struggling and it's okay to ask for help at that point. Anicca, Arahant, like presumably that's why we have the Sangha. It's like, oh dude, I'm having a tough day. We've got this.

**Speaker A:** We've got this. Exactly. So that's in fact, um, do you know the lines in that song about don't worry, be happy? There's a line in there that says, you're not happy, give me a call, I make you happy. That's the Sangha. That's it.

**Speaker C:** Wait, what was the Say that line again.

**Speaker A:** There's a line in the song. It's both Bobby McFerrin and Bob Marley of Rastafarian fame have this song, "Don't Worry, Be Happy." Don't worry. Yeah, well, there's a line in that song that it says, "If you're not happy, give me a call, I make you happy."

**Speaker C:** happy. Yeah, yeah, that's it.

**Speaker A:** And that's the Sangha, being willing to make people happy. Well, you got to have some happy before you could give it away. You can't give a Merry Christmas if you don't have Merry. So get married, have your own damn ho ho hos.

**Speaker B:** I think that comes back to with like the noble Dharma, right, where you are gladdening the mind, doing, taking care of that, and then the Sila comes, right?

**Speaker A:** So yes, exactly, because if you can settle down and take a deep breath and say everything is okay, it's unlikely for you then to stand up and clobber your boss.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I've found the practice to be a huge benefit for like just, you know, carrying on like when I'm at my job and all that and just, oh, I can still just enjoy, right? Like I can take a deep breath.

**Speaker A:** That's what I'm here for. I can enjoy this. I don't have to make it work. I can have fun.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah. Like yesterday I got called in for extra, you know, shift I had to cover for someone, or, you know, but I wanted to cover for someone because I'm like, hey, you know what, it kind of helps out, you know. And so I just went, you know, I went in and I'm just like, hey, I can remember to take a deep breath and come back home and it's all good, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that is a really, really excellent way of looking at— and we'll finish up with this— and that is there are various groups of the letter P that's used, and the one group that I'm thinking of is practice, performance, and play, that any good musician has to go through that sequence. So we have to practice first, and generally we practice, we don't even want mommy to hear us play the piano, especially if it's violin, because much of the practice in the early days is actually being able to finger it so that you get the right note that you're trying to hit. And later it's time to do a public performance, and we've got all butterflies in the stomach and anything like that. And so we're intently making sure that we're practicing correctly in front of an audience. We're really on it. We're going to make sure. But if we played that same tune 100 times, 300 times, 500 times, it's no longer a matter of knowing it by heart. No, that was like the 4th or 5th time. That we played it. No, learning it by heart means that it really is in there. And now when we perform that piece of music, it's actually quite playful that we really enjoy playing it. It gets a little bounce to it. Okay. That is not there in the performance. So as your practice, Drew, increases your ability to be in that performance mood of dealing with the boss or whoever like that, that is still just a performance play. There'll become a day when you get so skilled at doing that that you can even play with an angry boss.

**Speaker C:** Here's the thing, maybe one last question. Why is it that now I can sit down and I can sit down for a lot longer and I can be a lot more confident and most of the time, you know, obviously you have ups and downs, but most of the time, like, I would not have even imagined that my practice would be like this even just a few months ago. Honestly, like, if somebody had told me this is what— I know it doesn't

**Speaker A:** do me any good when I say to the kids, students, I told you so.

**Speaker C:** This is like, I just genuinely, I would have thought, like, if somebody had told me this, I think I would have thought they were crazy. Me, like, like, how you fit this in your life, how does this work, you know, like all that sort of stuff. Yet, you know, as soon as I have, you know, one of those sometimes you feel like a nut sats, I forget how far I've come. And just a few months ago, the, the even the, the, the thought of even having a, uh, you know, I feel like a nut sats for that long would have been like, whoa, how'd you do that?

**Speaker D:** Uh-huh.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the Sati. We remember more often and we remember quicker when that stuff comes up, when those feelings of, "Oh, this is a nut to crack." If we can remember that time, at that point we can say, "Oh, wait a minute, I can crack this nut. There's nothing to it." And so sometimes we think things are hard, they're a nut, and sometimes we say that things are easy, it's more like pudding. Everybody thinks they've got an avocado when all they have is a cream donut, right? Isn't it the avocado that's got a great big nut inside? And not only that, but the stuff around it is not all of that great. It's almost an acquired taste. And that's what we think life is. It's an avocado. Where in fact, no, life is really a cream donut. It's up to you, your attitude.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so this is when we get to the point of that we can perform the Dharma when we're around other people that are not performing or have no clue about the Dharma. We can still get those slings and arrows of outrageous fortune that they ding us with. And remove that in 5 seconds or so. And then pretty soon we get to the point that, hey, that doesn't ding at all. I don't even have to, you know, it doesn't even slow me down. I'm still dancing with this dude.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so that's when it becomes playful. So the skill levels is growing, and when the skills get so much that you got this tune wired and you know it, then you don't have to pay much close attention to getting every step or every note correct. You're just having too much fun now. Yeah, because you know what we're playing is music, not noise.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Drew, thanks for sharing. I'm really glad that you guys are here. And Marcus, thank you. You're the poly scholar here. By the way, everybody, Marcus actually lives here in Thailand.

**Speaker C:** Oh no, I just wanted to say just thank you as well. Um, every time, like, you know, Mara's like, uh, you know, you're hungry, you don't need to jump on the call, or it's fine, you can sleep in or something. And yeah, I always enjoy the call. Like, it's just like, oh, it's like that reset. I was like, oh yeah, no, this is how— like, oh yeah, this is how you do it, this is how you do it. And just come back it every week. It's just really useful.

**Speaker A:** Excellent, excellent. And I'm the same way. I like it. I come here because I really get a kick out of seeing the students as they grow and mature, watch the various styles. Exactly.

**Speaker E:** Okay, you know, I found something kind of similar, um, but it does tie in. You were talking about, um, when I, when I joined, about the whole funeral Samadhi thing, and it's actually on the Mara Anapanasati Sutta, Mindfulness of Death. And so maybe either I've got it mixed up or it was Mindfulness of Death all along, where it says when should you— I'll link it. I'll link it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay, it's a long one. Yeah, I'll link it to the Sangha UK for us to see later, and we'll put it on the link. Okay, on the YouTube. So anyway, guys, thank you very much. This has been really great.

**Speaker B:** It's been wonderful. Thank you so much.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, you don't have to thank me. I'm the one who gets all the benefits. As they said in the 18th century, the pleasure is all mine.

**Speaker C:** There's plenty of pleasure to go around in this case.

**Speaker A:** Shucks, and I thought it was all mine.

**Speaker C:** Not me, not mine.

**Speaker A:** No. Oh yeah, okay, you can have some too. It's lovely to share with you guys. Thank you so much.

**Speaker C:** Thank you.

**Speaker E:** Thank you.

**Speaker C:** See you. Thank you.

**Speaker E:** Have a good day, everybody.

**Speaker A:** Okay, bye-bye. All right.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato with Sangha friends, centers on a practical, integrated approach to the Buddha's teachings, moving away from rigid, step-by-step methods toward a more fluid and joyful practice. Here is a summary of the key themes and instructions:

### Core Themes and Instructions

**1. Anapanasati (Mindfulness of Breathing) as a Unified Practice, Not Linear Steps**
*   The 16 steps of the Anapanasati Sutta are not a sequential ladder but more like **musical notes or dance steps** to be played in harmony with the present moment.
*   The sutta is structured didactically (for teaching) but should be practiced as an integrated whole. The first two steps of each of the four "tetrads" are for beginners, the latter two for adepts.
*   The practice is deeply intertwined with the **Satipatthana (Foundations of Mindfulness)**, which align with the ancient understanding of the four elements: body (earth), feelings (water), mind (fire), and mental objects (air).

**2. The "Noble" vs. "Ordinary" Eightfold Path**
*   The standard sequence of **Sila-Samadhi-Pañña (Virtue-Concentration-Wisdom)** is the "ordinary" path, often experienced as slow and dry.
*   The "noble" path, as outlined in MN 117 (The Great Forty), starts with **Pañña-Samadhi-Sila**. It begins by developing **right view, right mindfulness, and right effort**, which circulate together to generate a **"right attitude"** (Samma Sankappa)—a sense of security, comfort, and confidence ("I can handle this").
*   From this noble, organized mind, perfect virtue (**Sila**) arises naturally as an outcome, not as a burdensome prerequisite. In meditation, simply sitting secluded is perfect Sila.

**3. Cultivating the Right Attitude: From Loser to Winner**
*   The pivotal shift is from a problem-solving, striving mindset ("I must try hard to get a reward later") to a **confident, glad, and playful attitude**.
*   The instruction is: **"If at first you don't succeed, look at what you're doing."** Investigate, don't just grind.
*   When hindrances or unwholesome states arise, the response is **gladdening the mind**—congratulating yourself for spotting it ("Aha, I see you, Mara!") and then relaxing back into wholesomeness. This builds **Piti (joy/rapture)** and **Sukkha (happiness/pleasure)**.
*   This attitude turns practice from a grim task into a **joyful activity you *want* to do**, making effort feel effortless.

**4. Integration of Core Teachings**
*   The talk connects Anapanasati (MN 118) directly with the Noble Eightfold Path (MN 117) and the Jhanas (MN 119).
*   The **Seven Factors of Enlightenment** are the fulfillment of the path's skills. "Unremitting mindfulness" (the first factor) is developed in Anapanasati steps 9 & 10 (gladdening and steadying the mind).
*   **First Jhana** is described not as a mystical trance but as an **ordinary, wholesome state of mind** characterized by applied & sustained thought, joy, happiness, and bodily relaxation—all cultivated through this integrated Anapanasati practice.
*   The entire Dhamma (Four Noble Truths, Dependent Origination, etc.) is presented as a **unified package** that becomes clear through correct practice, not through academic study alone.

**5. Practical Application in Daily Life**
*   The goal is to **"dodge the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune"** by not letting external events or criticism wound the sense of self.
*   When hit by a negative mental state (the "arrow"), the practice is to **"take five"**—pause for just 5-15 seconds to gladden the mind, relax, and remember "I can handle this." Clean up mental mess as you go, don't let it pile up.
*   Formal sitting practice is for deepening the skill; life is for **playful performance** of that skill. With enough practice, dealing with difficulty becomes playful.
*   **Remembering the breath is always a "now" activity.** The attitude should be one of joy when you remember, not self-criticism when you forget.

**6. Contemplation of Death and Letting Go**
*   Through anecdotes about funerals and charnel grounds, the talk emphasizes **directly confronting the reality of death** to overcome fear and understand impermanence.
*   This aligns with the Buddha's use of existing contemplative methods (like corpse meditation) to point toward **anatta (not-self)** and the cooling release of **Nibbana**, which is simply the ultimate relaxation and chilling out.

### Overall Message
The path is about **changing your mental attitude from one of a struggling victim to a confident, joyful participant**. By practicing Anapanasati as an integrated art—focusing on gladdening the mind, cultivating joy, and relaxing into the present—you naturally develop concentration, wisdom, and virtue. This turns the Dhamma from a complex philosophical system into a simple, enjoyable, and immediately applicable practice for finding security and happiness in every moment, regardless of circumstances.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this talk transcript, the speaker uses a rich tapestry of **metaphors and stories** to explain complex Dhamma concepts, particularly about meditation practice (Anapanasati), the path, and the mindset of practice. Here is a breakdown:

### **Key Metaphors**

1.  **Musical Metaphors (for the 16 steps of Anapanasati):**
    *   **Not "Steps," but "Dance Steps" or "Notes on a Piano":** This reframes the practice from a rigid, linear sequence to a fluid, harmonious activity. The 16 aspects are like notes you learn to play in various orders and combinations.
    *   **"The universe is playing music... we get in harmony with it":** Practice is about aligning with the natural flow of reality, not imposing a structure.
    *   **"Practice some chords and scales first... get the fingering down":** Acknowledges the need for initial skill-building, but as a joyful prelude to making music, not as a grim duty.
    *   **"Practice, Performance, and Play":** Compares the meditator's journey to a musician's: initial awkward practice, then deliberate performance, and finally effortless, joyful play.

2.  **Culinary/Kitchen Metaphors (for the mind and practice):**
    *   **The "Clean Kitchen" vs. "Messy Kitchen" Restaurant:** This story contrasts two approaches to meditation. The "slow path" of just noting (Vipassana) is like a kitchen that cooks frantically without cleaning, eventually becoming overwhelmed by its own mess. The "noble path" (integrating Samatha/Jhana factors) is like cleaning up unwholesome states (the mess) as you go, maintaining a workable, pleasant mind-space.

3.  **Problem-Solving Metaphor:**
    *   **The "Problem Solver" who runs out of problems:** Illustrates how the habitual mindset of seeking out and fixing problems is itself a source of dukkha. The noble path involves shifting to a "there is no problem" mindset.

4.  **Elemental Metaphors (for the Four Foundations of Mindfulness - Satipatthana):**
    *   **Body = Earth (solid)**
    *   **Feelings (Vedana) = Water (fluid)**
    *   **Mind = Fire (energetic, burning)**
    *   **Mental Objects (Dhammas) = Air/Wind (atmosphere, everything around us)**
    *   The speaker links this ancient framework to the structure of the Anapanasati Sutta.

5.  **The "Arrow" Metaphor (from the Suttas):**
    *   Referencing the **Mālukyaputta Sutta (MN 63)**, the speaker uses the story of a man shot with an arrow who refuses treatment until he knows all the details about the arrow and archer. The metaphor is that an unwholesome thought or painful experience is the arrow. The inefficient, worldly response is to dwell on "why" or "who." The Dhamma response is to immediately "remove the arrow"—to let go and heal the mind without getting lost in story.

6.  **Other Potent Metaphors:**
    *   **"Slings and arrows of outrageous fortune" (from Shakespeare):** Used to describe the unexpected, often unpleasant events of life. The practice is about learning to see them coming and step out of the way (with mindfulness) so they don't "hit" us and cause mental suffering.
    *   **"Skin in the game":** To have a personal investment and apply genuine effort in the practice.
    *   **"Whipped it too":** A playful, modern phrase used to summarize the outcome of successful practice—everything is integrated and wholesome.
    *   **Avocado vs. Cream Donut:** Life is not a hard nut to crack (avocado) but can be experienced as something sweet and enjoyable (cream donut), based on our attitude.

### **Key Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Teenager and the Garbage:** A simple story contrasting effort born of obligation (being told to clean) with effortless action born of a gladdened mind and right attitude (wanting to make mom happy). This illustrates how **Samma Vayama (Right Effort)** transforms when the mind is joyful.

2.  **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's Trial:** The story of how the teacher's lineage founder was put on trial for "teaching the right things to the wrong people" (the general public). This underscores the radical, accessible approach being transmitted in the talk.

3.  **The Burning Ghats of Varanasi:** A vivid, first-person account of funeral pyres in India. This serves as a direct, visceral **charnel ground contemplation**, illustrating the reality of death, decay, and the Buddha's rejection of the permanent soul (anatta). It grounds the philosophical teaching in stark reality.

4.  **The Goenka Retreat & Harry Potter:** A student's anecdote about how mental content from before a retreat (watching a movie) played out during sitting, highlighting the importance of preparing the mind and the nature of mental "baggage."

5.  **Funerals in North Carolina:** The speaker's personal stories of conducting many funerals as a monk. These are used to normalize death, reduce the fear of it, and illustrate the importance of direct confrontation with mortality as part of the path.

6.  **The Buddha's Doctor Analogy (Ayurvedic Medicine):** The story that the template for the **Four Noble Truths** (illness, cause, cure, treatment) came from ancient Ayurvedic medicine, framing the Dhamma as a practical system of healing, not abstract philosophy.

7.  **The Sutta of the Breath (referenced by Marcus):** Although not told in full, the group discusses a sutta where monks discuss how often one should remember the breath—from once a day down to "this very breath." The punchline is that the practice happens **"when you remember,"** emphasizing immediacy and lack of self-recrimination.

### **Overall Function of the Metaphors and Stories:**
The speaker uses these devices to:
*   **Demystify** complex sutta structures and Pali terms.
*   **Ground** ancient teachings in modern, relatable experiences.
*   **Shift the listener's attitude** from one of grim, effortful striving to one of playful, confident, and joyful exploration.
*   **Emphasize experience** over intellectual theory.
*   **Connect different parts of the teaching** (Jhanas, Anapanasati, Noble Eightfold Path) into a unified, practical whole.
