### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Maybe some people will still pop, see how it goes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** I tried to join Mikey or Mickey— Mikey's one on Sunday because Dhammarato was not feeling well or something like that. Yeah, I joined late because I forgot about it, but then when I was trying to join, it wouldn't allow me. Oh, finally kind of figured it out. I think the meeting adjourned early. Yeah, maybe like— oh, that sucks.

**Speaker B:** Was that through Skype?

**Speaker A:** What's that?

**Speaker B:** Was that on Skype?

**Speaker A:** Yes, I believe so. I don't know if it was today or Friday, maybe Friday.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Friday.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Um, yeah, Dhammarato joined. Yeah, I think there was one on— yeah, Saturday or Sunday, I get confused.

**Speaker A:** So— oh yeah, but he's still under—.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, he's still struggling. He's still very weak.

**Speaker A:** And— oh really? Yeah, hope he gets better, man.

**Speaker B:** So how's your practice going? Anything?

**Speaker A:** Very, very well. Yeah, just, um, just relaxing, breathing.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, very, very nice. You know, it's like a big load off your shoulders when you're like, when you tell yourself, you know, you don't have to get anywhere or do anything really. Yeah. Become something, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, it's kind of nice.

**Speaker B:** I've definitely noticed a shift since I've started talking to yourself and Dhammarato and you guys. Like, just, I used to get a bit hung up on the teachings, you know, a bit, oh, I've got to do this practice and I've got to do that practice. And then, yeah, like you say, when you just realize that, yeah, just, you can just relax and breathe and stop and that's all you really need to do and everything's all right. Like, It's kind of a nice—.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it takes, it almost takes some humility to just be like, oh, it's just breathing and relaxing. You know, a lot of newcomers especially, because they get so hung up on the Pali canon and all the vocabulary words. And it's, you know, it's like I've said this before, it's like if you're learning to ride a bike And then you have a teacher trying to help you, you know, and it's simple, but it just takes a little bit of, you know, practice. Yeah, every time you try to tell the people, you know, one foot in front of the other, you know, this is the brake. Actually, in Chapter 32, it says that we must check the tires are inflated to the proper— it's like It's like they don't, they don't get it, you know. They don't understand. It's simple. Hi, buddy.

**Speaker D:** Hey, Lou.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I know what you mean. It's like swimming, doing freestyle swimming. Like, once you kind of learn, you just— I remember one time swimming at a pool and I stopped at the end of a lap and this guy just said to me, how do you do it?

**Speaker A:** How do you do it? I'm like, I don't know, you just do it.

**Speaker B:** There's no kind of— I don't know, you just learn and you do it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, um, if you're not trying to, um, to listen carefully and say, okay, these guys say that all these concepts—.

**Speaker E:** Not.

**Speaker A:** Are not important. And if you don't listen to breathing and relaxing and everything's okay now, wholesomeness, the wholesomeness that everything literally is okay, your mind will wander. It's just a natural phenomenon, you know. But the human tendency is we want to be the best student, we want to be the best this, the best that, the win the race, run the thing, you know, get there first. And that's just not important. It's just important to be the best at getting it right and understanding. Ironically, getting it right He's just letting it go and being joyful and happy. Yeah, with a cool mind that's just like, whatever, you know?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I can't get rid of this glare. Sorry.

**Speaker A:** That'S okay. Divinity. Damn glare. That's awesome, looks cool. But yeah, it's almost like with people you're speaking with to help them to listen to that. It's not about getting it right. It's about getting it joyful and happy and friendship and letting things go, letting concepts go. But we hold on to the ego, we hold on to this character, and it solidifies the concepts, and the whole ball of wax gets rolling again, the whole wheel of Samsara. And you know, for anybody who's explaining the Dharma, it's like Jesus said too, you got to take a step back, and you can't always throw pearls of wisdom to swine. They just don't know what to do with it. They're going to destroy it. So sometimes I find myself, I have to take a step back and be like, let them play, you know? Yeah. Let them figure it out for themselves sometimes. And in a way, it's kind of, it's a toss in the air, you know? It's not, it's just like everything's Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta. It's not within our control. We can't control others. We can't control what they're doing. So we're letting it go. When we're being happy and peaceful. Hi, Edward.

**Speaker B:** Hey, Edward.

**Speaker E:** Hey, guys.

**Speaker A:** Dude, being peaceful.

**Speaker B:** Got it.

**Speaker A:** Cool. Now that you got it, hold on to it for dear life and don't let go of it. That's what everyone does. They get— they get peace, and then they— then they want to keep that state forever, but it's not going to last, you know. It's almost like there's two types of peace. There's the bodily peace that we all can experience any day activity, but then there's the peace behind the anger. There's the peace behind the frustration and the anxiety. There's the peace and the wisdom behind the negative Dukkha feelings. Not attaching to that Dukkha, then we can be free of it. What I mean, the Dhamma, the body is not going to get rid of these Dukkha feelings, thoughts, and emotions. They will never— there's nothing we could do. It's just a natural phenomenon. But the Buddha gave us the the correct pointers that these things won't last. So when there is anger, take shelter in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. When there is frustration, take shelter in Anapanasati, in the breath, right here, right now, and the wholesome thought that everything's okay. Then those things pass, and you get better at it with practice. You know, it's not some mystical thing to understand. It's very, very simple. Nothing you do whatsoever can change nature. Nothing you do whatsoever will turn a chicken into a duck and a duck into a chicken, like Ajahn Chah says. Nothing we do whatsoever will make you a magical Buddha that your body will not experience anger, hatred, delusion, frustration, lust, whatever. Those things will never go away until the body dies, of course. But while we're alive, we can remain unattached to those things and let them pass. So when they come, we remind ourselves, these are not— this is not— I don't have to be attached to these passing phenomena. I have a choice, and I could come back to the breath, come back home whenever I wish. And then up and down disappear, right and wrong disappear, good and evil disappear, enlightenment and non-enlightenment, getting it right, not getting it right. All those words disappear. All those tools disappear. They will return, but we don't need to be clinging to them. Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha— that's all the Buddha taught. Some passing phenomena comes in the mind You can hold on to it, you can play with it, just don't get attached to it. You can use it as a tool, just don't hold on to it, you know, or it'll burn you. It's like fire. It has its function, it has a great function, but you have to use it wisely. You have to see it for what it is, a tool that if used incorrectly can burn us, you know. Well, how are you guys doing? Anybody got anything on their mind they want to talk about?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I'm good, man. I was just thinking about helping people like start a practice when they're down. I think you've taught about it. Just easiest, like going to the breath and doing Anapanasati. But I was just thinking about the barriers to entry to that in people's minds. Like, it might be an illusion, but there's got to be some barrier to entry, because otherwise, you know, they would just easily do it all the time. So I was just thinking about those. What are your thoughts on that?

**Speaker A:** The barrier between— the barrier that frustrates people, where they get stuck at, I believe is that they're trying to change the mind. They're trying to— when anger arises, they don't want anger there. They want it to go away. They want to be enlightened. They want peaceful. Instead, when anger comes, there's nothing you can do about it. Just let it go. Let it pass. Take refuge in Anapanasati, in the breath. Remember that everything's okay. Don't cling to it, and it will pass. But a great misunderstanding comes in all spirituality, but particularly obviously Buddhism and the Dharma practice that we're all practicing. The greatest understanding is that there's some type of maze to navigate that will make those feelings not arise. And that's just superstitious nonsense. Nature is nature. A human body is a human. As the bird flies, the human goes through all the thoughts, feelings, and emotions, the myriad of those ups and downs. We can't control it. We can control our attitude towards it. We can control our attachments to those things, those phenomena that pass. That's what we can control. If there was some kind of light bulb moment, that's it. That nothing you do will make the mind anything other than the mind. It's going to be the mind. All we can do is see it for what it is, have the wisdom to realize it's all Anicca, Dukkha, and Arhat. When there's anger, don't act on anger, because when we act on it, that's the negative Kamma that everybody's talking about, based on the negative Samskara that we've all had our whole lives, that society gives us, that we've cultivated over these years. When anger arises, we act out on it. You can be angry. Just don't act out on it. That's when the Kamma wheel gets you, because when you punch one of your friends in the face, whether you like it or not, you've created a whole wheel of Samsara now you got to deal with. And even if you're— if you have the wisdom to go back to the breath, good luck getting rid of those emotions that have been triggered, that are already the chemicals flowing in the brain. That's the Kamma, and it's nearly impossible to get rid of those once they start. They won't last. But you don't have to bang your head against the wall. You don't have to deal with any of that. Nip it in the bud before it starts. Oh, I see that there's anger. That's okay, everything's fine right now. There's nothing to do. That's the best part. We're all Buddhas already. We're all enlightened because we don't care about enlightenment. We don't care about attachments. We care about peace. You sit in a room quietly, there won't be a thing in the world that wants to mess with you. And if there is, it'll be some rare occasion and your biology will take.

**Speaker D:** Over in that moment.

**Speaker A:** You have nothing to worry about even if a bear breaks into your house. But 99.9% of the time, if you don't go fucking around with snakes, they ain't gonna bite you. You don't go fucking around hanging around with the wrong crowd, likely you're not gonna be arrested by some cop. Likely you're not gonna get into any trouble when you're just quietly in your room on some Buddha Sangha call. You know, and we could live the rest of our lives with that beautiful knowledge that we're okay. And the more we dive into the Dharma, the higher probability that everything will continue to be okay, even in a— and it goes higher and higher and higher. And this is, this is the joy of the Dharma practice, you know. That's why we can recognize when we see masters even higher than ourselves We're like, oh yeah, it goes even higher than that. Cool, man. It gives us an excitement. It gives us a Piti, you know. It gives us— we can do this and we can go and go and go, and almost even to the point where some kind of miraculous things happen. And not that that's the point, and not that that's what we're chasing, like everything else in life, but that's another piece of beautiful icing on the cake, that there's even crazy shit that happens. But it's not important. You know, the Jhanas and all these things, they're great, but it's not important. But enjoy them if they come and let them go if they pass. But anybody else want to answer his question or talk about anything that's on your mind?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, we talked about barriers to entry to this present moment, and I think one of the nice ways that we could look at this is to examine the commonly heard phrase, you know, you're only limited by your imagination. Now, when a normal person hears this, they'll think, "Oh, I need to imagine harder, I need to imagine bigger, I need to have a stronger imagination, I need to make up more stories, I need to figure out how to get to the moon or whatever." But really the limitation that you're being placed in with your imagination is imagining that there's something to do, imagining that there's a barrier to the present moment. If we can get rid of that by just seeing through it, you don't have to do anything special, just see that it's your imagination that's precluding you from being here now, there's nothing left to do. There is no barrier. You're always doing Anapanasati. Okay, Anapanasati is a change model. So if you see that you're imagining something, you just see through that. You just be done with it. You know, there's no need to do anything. That's why you always hear Dhammarato talk like that. Nothing to do, nowhere to go. There's not anything that there is to do or anywhere that there is to go is just your imagination running wild. So when we hear that you're limited by your imagination, we can start to see that in a different way. We can say, "Oh yeah, I am, because I believe there's something to do. I believe that this moment isn't just like it is right now." And that imagination is in fact just arguing with reality, because you're always here. You know, there's not any other place or time that you can be. You know, and even places and times are more imaginary things. You know, so that's why they say silly stuff like A contemplative doesn't have a past or a future, you know, and it sounds so crazy. Oh, how could that be? Well, they stop making it up. They just stay here right now, and then they're okay again, you know. And anytime that they notice that their imagination has started to box them in, they say, oh, I see that. I see you, imagination. Thanks for coming. I know that in the past you've tried to help me by doing that, but we don't need to do that right now. I'm already okay. And we just have more and more wholesome thoughts, clean out the mind with the wholesome thoughts. And when the wholesome thoughts have done their job Just play with the gaps, you know, and if the mind goes back in the gutter, clean it out again. But really, that's all there is to do, is as soon as we come out of dissatisfaction, all that stuff about here and there drops away, you know. That is dissatisfaction, thinking about the things in terms of here and there. That is duality, is having dissatisfaction. So the only job that needs to be done is to come out of that dissatisfaction, and then there's no more work to do. There's just this, and we can be perfectly okay with this again and again, so long as we remember to stop fighting with what's here already. Can't change it. Only time you can heal the past or change the future is right now. So don't be limited by your imagination, and you'll recognize that you've always been doing Anapanasati. You know, now you're just doing it a little more skillfully when you recognize that, hey, I'm here, it's now, I'm already ready to go, no problem, no barrier, everything is okay. It's a gateless gate.

**Speaker A:** Totally, dude. Anybody else have anything to add on to that, or any random things you want to say?

**Speaker D:** I have a random thing to say.

**Speaker A:** Shoot.

**Speaker D:** It's, uh, um, have you guys heard of the Austrian poet, uh, Rainer Maria Rilke? It's hard to say his name properly. You should look him up. He's like the, he's like the Zen master of the West.

**Speaker A:** Nice.

**Speaker D:** I was thinking of him while you were talking, Dhamma Dassa. He says things like, you know, just let everything happen to you, you know, you have no control over this world. There's one quote that's a little bit more, I guess, heavy-handed, where he says, you know, each torpid turn of this world bears such disinherited children to whom neither what's been nor what is coming belongs, which I feel that kind of illustrates what you were saying, Dhamma Dasa. You know, it's just nature, you know, the body And the mind, you know, mental states, these things go through different changes. You know, apple trees, apple, orange trees, orange, you know. The human organism creates different states of mind. And none of it is a problem unless you take it to be permanent or you take it to be who you are. It just comes and goes. You know, you just let it do its thing. You know, it's really no need to make a problem out of any of it. He's got a lot of poetry just with that kind of sentiment, you know, and sometimes it's nice to read some Western poets with a bit of a Zen spirit because the flavor is different a little bit.

**Speaker C:** Could you put his name in the chat for us, Michael? I would like to read him.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Sure.

**Speaker C:** Thank you so much.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's why Buddha Dasabikkhu seemed to really like Zen. Dhammarato said a beautiful thing one time. He's like, you know, the Theravadans, they're kind of obsessed with the scholarliness of it all, but the Zens, you know, they didn't have the books. They kind of, by word of mouth and stuff, you know, they heard the stories and they found it in their heart and they took it, you know, back to Japan or China. China first, and they brought it with them in their heart, you know. And it's a good thing to remember that even in Theravada, there's a lot of illiterate monks who couldn't tell you anything. Some of them, like we've talked about before, some of their teachers just said, chant Butoh and I'll see you in 10, 15, 20 years. Good luck. And there you go. They were satisfied. Isn't that funny? All these things we talk about, and some teachers just go to their best students and they just chant Butoh, keep an eye on the breath, keep an eye on the body if you get lost, and that's it. Wow. But we create the barriers like Alexander was saying. And.

**Speaker D:** Why?

**Speaker A:** Why put the barriers in front of us? There's no need to. Those are just bad habits. Just bad habits. Nothing to do, nowhere to go. I'm not sure of anything. Isn't that awesome that we don't have to be sure of anything? Fuck it.

**Speaker B:** You know.

**Speaker A:** We're not causing Dukkha. I remember reading Ajahn Chah, he was saying He was in the graveyard. He was sitting there for so long, he was pissing blood. He had something wrong with him, and he thought to himself— at first he was so worried, like, God, I'm here in this graveyard, it's creepy, now I'm pissing blood on top of it because I haven't moved in God knows how many hours, how many days. And he said to himself, fuck it, if I die, I die. If I get sick, I get sick. I'm not hurting anybody, I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm sitting here peacefully practicing the Dharma. You know, if it's nature's way that I'm going to sit here and deteriorate and die, go for it, bring it on. What can I do? I'm just going to have a joyful heart here and now. Fuck it.

**Speaker D:** You know, it's interesting, interesting to watch the evolution of Buddhism as it left, you know, the South Asian subcontinent we call India now and went to China and Japan and shed all of its— shed a lot of the content that Fuck It really gets rid of. But, you know, you have a very different image of wisdom there. You know, it's very much like, you know, the joyful Bodhisattva wandering through the forest with a jug of wine on his hip and a bag full of candy on his back that he just hands out to kids. And, you know, just no worries about anything in the world, no rules about, you know, how to sit up straight, or, you know, how long you should fast for, or how many precepts you should keep, or what theories you should know, or, you know, just, just a very much just It really just coming from that place of understanding that everything is just the expression of a natural process beyond our scope. And trying to judge it or do anything about it is like a shadow trying to control what the body does, you know what I mean? Because our sense of self, our sense of ownership is really the shadow of this whole process. Every effort we take to judge or control is feeble in a way, and that's just where all the suffering comes from. You see that shift as Buddhism goes north and east, and I feel that that's the appropriate evolution of Buddhism, because if you look, if you spend a lot of time with Theravada Buddhism, a lot of the practices are just there to wear out your desire for something more. You know, it's like, okay, you can reach these great states of Jhana, but like you said, like, those things come and go as well. Eventually you just have to be satisfied with the thing that takes no effort, the thing that doesn't come and go, which is just an attitude of allowing things to be as they are. You can't maintain a state of Jhana, and, you know, what's the point of spending your life putting in an effort to maintain anything at all, you know, just be at peace with that which requires no maintenance at all.

**Speaker A:** Does your baby need maintenance?

**Speaker D:** I was wondering if you guys could hear that. I'm gonna go maintain my baby.

**Speaker E:** That's interesting though. Not being to maintain anything. Like, I do Anapanasati, and then I do like insight practice. And I would like to maintain a state of awareness that's heightened or clear. And that's not always the case. I'd like to, like, know and understand impermanence all the time and be okay with it. So forget about that.

**Speaker C:** And I can tell you about impermanence. One of the ways to really think about Anicca, because Anapanasati has this insight practice right built into it, it's the fourth tetrad. Anicca we talk about as impermanence or inconstancy, and we make it this thing that we have to see. But really, one of the ways that we could most beneficially talk about Anicca is no thing whatsoever can be maintained to my liking for very long, if at all. If I have the wrong perception of Nietzsche, which is the opposite, the idea that I can maintain things to my liking, then we suffer, we have Dukkha. And if we have Dukkha because of this, then we see Anatta, and it's terrifying. And Anatta really means no thing whatsoever is under my complete control. And if I don't recognize that, then I'm helpless to the Dukkha. I can't make a change that brings me out of Dukkha because I think that things can be maintained. So I keep doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. And Albert Einstein said that's the definition of insanity. So you already have clear sight when you just practice Anapanasati like you're talking about. If we can stop the stories, just stop telling them, stop pretending like we need to tell them. We don't even have to stop telling them. Like, that's the no-maintenance part. They can come and go however they want to come and go. We just need to see clearly that that's what they are—stories. That's the insight right there into Anicca. And then we can look and we can see that everything that's born gets old, falls apart, and dies. That's it. Boom. Done. Once we see that, we know it's no longer worth insisting on anything. And that's freedom. We don't insist on anything. Because we know that everything that's out there is going to get old, fall apart, and die. So we stop playing Humpty Dumpty because all the king's men and all the king's horses are really dissatisfied. They keep trying to put him back together and it just doesn't happen. They just can't do it because he's gonna fall apart. So when we look at it that way, we know that we can just let it go. And that's the fourth tetrad of Anapanasati right there, is everything gets old. That's Anicca. Everything falls apart, you know, that's the Next part, dispassion is how it's normally talked about, but really it's noticing that everything falls apart, so it's not useful to maintain it in any sort of way. And then everything dies, and that's cessation. That's that third step in the fourth tetrad, you know. And then we could call it letting it rot, or we could call it letting it go. That's the fourth step in Anapanasati. So all it is is seeing that this is happening all of the time, to include those mental states of clarity. They get manufactured, put together in the mind— boom, boom, boom— that's a Samskara. And then that Samskara gets old, falls apart, and dies. And that last step is letting it go, throwing it back to nature, no longer taking what doesn't belong to us. That's the second precept. And on a mundane level, that means don't take your buddy's dollars. On a supramundane level, that means stop taking what belongs to nature. Stop trying to hold reality as you and yours, like you can put it together the way that you want, because Anicca, Anicca vatta Sankhara, Anicca, Anicca, Anicca, everything is always going to not be able to be maintained to my liking for very long. And even if I manage to somehow be a really rich dewa and I can put it all together and maintain it for a long time, I'm going to die and then I'm going to have to let it all go. So really what we're doing is trying to get ahead of the game here, because just like everything else, we're going to die and we're going to have to let it all go. And if we're not ready to let it go when we die, oh wow, that's going to be so much harder. You know, it's like if you see the buses coming You just get out of the way. You don't stand in front of the bus and get hit over and over and over again, you know. So this is really— we have to take the practice of Anapanasati out of the supernatural realm. We have to bring it into here now, you know. And here now is really simple. Reality is super duper simple. It's when we start imagining things about what we have to do that it gets complicated, and then we need to start taking the breath. And really just one breath is all it takes if we connect it like that. We can say, "Oh man, wow, what a nice breath this is. How nice, I'm going to really enjoy this. Oh man." And that's insight right there. That's really it. The teachings of the Buddha are super simple and they're a dead loss. We don't have to worry about gaining anything whatsoever because there's nothing to gain. Everything is just like this.

**Speaker A:** Totally. Anybody else have anything to say, um, who hasn't talked or anything?

**Speaker F:** Oh no, I just, uh, wanted to thank everyone. It's wonderful hearing from Michael and Alexander. Well put. Yeah, letting it just brought nothing to be maintained. Yeah, I suppose when it comes to like the right noble effort, it really is just— it's just seeing those hindrances and just seeing and abandoning them. But like, those are the things that are really getting in the way of seeing reality as it is, right? Of being able to settle down. That's really it. But again, it's not making an enemy with them. It's just saying, okay, I see you there, old friend. I see you arise. And yeah, I think when it comes to working with the mind, at least in the experience here, being able to work with wholesome thoughts, you know, changing the wholesome thoughts, you know, it's just like putting in those little inputs here and there. You know, that works with the conditionings to uncondition. Right? But ultimately, when it comes to things like feelings that arise, you know, it's like, you know, really coming back to being like, it's okay to feel this way. Just like, it's okay. I mean, that's changing that attitude and that disposition of having, you know, aversion. Like, anger arises, and then one feels aversion towards anger, and the cycle just kind of keeps continuing. But rather, just changing that attitude towards it's okay to feel this way, we don't need to act on this way, right? But the thought process might be, oh no, we must act on this, we need to do something about this. And so sort of seeing that mental thought processes is not even coming from a personal thing, it's just we, you know, we hear the Dhamma, we hear about it, and we kind of start to get this wholesome thing together. So it's just again putting in just enough effort where those causes and conditions are met to recognize that which doesn't require any causes or conditions, right? So just that sort of unconditional satisfaction that's available here and now, you know, but it's dropping away of like wanting things.

**Speaker C:** That's it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker F:** But yeah, just that light, that light effort, you know, which might seem like no effort sometimes.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker F:** Nothing to do.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely. Yeah, it's like being on a roller coaster and you have like some New Age friend with you who's in the spirituality and stuff and they're like trying to control the direction of the roller coaster with, you know, if I just, if I make a dream board or something, maybe I can make the roller coaster go left instead of right, or slower instead of faster. But the reality is the roller coaster is just being a roller coaster, and enjoy the ride. What other choice do you have?

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** You know, and the only effort required in that little example is change of attitude. A shift of our attention towards something that's illusory, attempting to control that which can't be controlled, and something that's more wholesome, like reality. The reality of the roller coaster. We just go along for the ride and it's fun. Sure, it may be scary here and there, but have fun with it. What else can you do?

**Speaker F:** Just enjoy the show.

**Speaker A:** Yes, enjoy the play of Sila. Well, let's see, anybody else have anything they want to talk about?

**Speaker D:** I was just going to say, one of the consequences of the practice doing well is you run out of insightful things to say.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you're just all saying the same thing. Slightly different styles, and that's the fun of it, you know. That's the fun of Dhammarato says it one way, Buddhadasa Bhikkhu says it one way, the Buddha said it one way, but we're all basically saying the same thing. We're just basically coming back to the breath, letting go, relaxing. Don't worry, be happy. And that's the fun of it too. Like, I don't know who was saying it. I don't know if it was DJ or somebody was saying it the other day. It's like, that's the fun of it. It's just, it's building the blocks in a different way. So it's in a way, it's like an art form, you know, expressing the Dharma in all different types of ways. And it's available to everybody. And it's You have to really fuck it up in order to fuck it up, you know. It's like, as long as you're not causing Dukkha to yourself or others, you know, this is— that's all it is, you know.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I would say doing it like this is, you know, entertaining. It's a nice way to apply and sustain the mind to the wholesome. Dharma is really wholesome, kind of like playing a duet on the same piano. Just talking out loud about things that are really good to keep in mind.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and letting go sometimes of even trying to make points, you know. Sometimes we're just— it's not about the notes you're playing. Does it sound pleasant to the ear when you play the guitar? Who cares about all our knowledge? Who cares about what note it is? Are we playing beautiful music? When we're speaking, are we speaking wisely? Are we making beautiful music with our mouths, speaking of the Dhamma? And again, it's hard not to when your intention is pure, when you have an earnest heart. It's hard to mess it up. If there was such a thing as messing it up, it would be ill intentions, and that's just all the demon realm. A lot of everybody in this side is nowhere near that, so it's like, it's all good all the time.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, it's just nurturing, you know, nurturing each other and the Dhamma itself. Yeah, so it's like, not like, oh, we have to make the most profound point or wins some, you know, philosophical debate or something. It's like, no, it's just about the practical aspect of the practice. And when we come together, we can share, and, you know, it's all right.

**Speaker A:** Yes. And if we were all together, we'd probably just be doing our chores or relaxing, and there would not even be any need to speak that much. But we're on Sangha calls, so we we play the game of speaking and talking about that, which is almost, you know, it's ironically impossible to almost talk about, yet it's not. You know, it's a fun game. You know, it's just relaxing, just breathing.

**Speaker F:** Now we can talk about it, but we don't need, you know, we don't need to talk about it.

**Speaker D:** We don't have to talk about it.

**Speaker F:** And I think that's sort of the nice play.

**Speaker D:** Yes, I guess you can say talking about it is just a way of sharing and spreading wholesome conditioning. You know, Bhante Pañññaji, he translates asava as influence, you know, because it's usually translated as outflows or inflows, but he talks about the word Asava as— forget the Indo-European root that it's related to, but it's the same root as like confluence and a couple others, of course. So, you know, influence, you know, the confluence is two rivers coming together. Influence is flowing in. So, you know, it's a fact that, you know, greed, hatred, and delusion are expressions of selfishness. And these forces can condition each other. If you're raised in a household by a greedy, selfish, mean, hateful person, those influences will be inside you. If you live in a racist society, you're going to have racism inside of you. If you live in a greedy society, Anagami, you're gonna have greed inside of you. We are influenced by our environment, you know, we're, as Thich Nhat Hanh said, you know, just as the paper is made of non-paper elements, you know, the self is made of non-self elements. Everything is made up of everything in its environment. So being aware of that, that's where DJ is talking about right effort, you know, being aware of of all of the different conditionings that are flowing in and flowing out, and having the wisdom to know that, yes, you know, in the broadest possible context, it's all nature. It's all, you know, the expression of— I mean, there's nothing that can't be true, you know. It's all just the expression of nature or God or whatever you want to call it, truth, you know. I mean, there's nothing that can't be what it is. But, you know, but we have to have the wisdom to know that certain types of conditions have harmful consequences. And so practicing non-greed, non-hatred, non-delusion, practicing being satisfied, practicing not being hateful, practicing not being greedy, practicing not being, you know, selfish and self-centered, and then talking about it with each other, you know, we're creating wholesome conditioning. We're basically influencing each other and influencing people around us so that, you know, we're— this conversation is not going to lead to a Holocaust, you know. This conversation is going to lead to more people sitting around smiling, essentially. So that's the point of talking about it, because, you know, ultimately, you know, conditions do have consequences. And even though everything is okay, we have to be aware that you know, self-centered greed, hatred, and delusion, when it's institutionalized in the form of groups, has pretty, pretty horrible consequences. So just reflecting on the balance between what we were talking about and, you know, that which requires no maintenance, and, you know, noble right effort, which is a form of maintenance that is necessary. And why we talk to each other about these things.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, thank you, Michael.

**Speaker E:** Thanks.

**Speaker B:** I was just going to jump in and say I posted it. I stole a quote from Dhammarato the other day when he was on the call, wrote it down, and I posted it the other day because I really liked it.

**Speaker A:** It was just.

**Speaker B:** The simplicity of the practice, so I was just going to read it out. The teaching of having wholesome thoughts, that's the Dhamma. Then Buddha is having these wholesome thoughts, and then Sangha is sharing those wholesome thoughts. This is the Triple Gem: Buddha, Dharma, Sangha. That's about as simple as I can put it.

**Speaker D:** Nice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I like that. I was just like, yeah, that's it, right? Yeah, I like that.

**Speaker D:** I heard Dhammarato once say that he remembers when he finally realized that Buddhism is a moral teaching or an ethical teaching. I mean, the Buddha dismisses metaphysics, you know, as he is. He's basically like, I'm not going to speak on that, you know. And so he focuses attention on making groups of people happy with the way things are so they don't go out killing each other, stealing from each other, raping each other, oppressing each other. You know, I mean, why do we know we don't need more than that? We don't need more than a society of people who are okay with the things, the way things are. And, you know, like, Dhammarato has these two phrases that I think are good phrases that I like to remember. He says, you know, everything is okay and everyone is a friend. I mean, you don't really need more than that. If everybody thought that way, then society would be just fine, you know. We don't need some big giant, you know, stars falling out of the sky explosive enlightenment experience. We just need to not be dissatisfied to the point that we're harming ourselves and harming others and over-consuming and whatnot. Like, the fact that we want more than that is what we're trying to uproot, you know, that we want some crazy spectacular ecstatic, you know, that's just the greed that we used to have towards the world coming into our practice and wanting something else, you know. So it's ultimately just meant to uproot dissatisfaction, you know, without without the force of dissatisfaction in us, then we're not going to go out wanting to harm people or ourselves or whatnot. And then when you get down into the nitty-gritty and people start saying like, okay, well then is it okay for me to watch TV? And you're like, well, I mean, answer that question, but yeah, probably.

**Speaker A:** You know.

**Speaker D:** It'S probably okay for you to watch some TV. I mean, you know, you don't have to sit in Zazen 24 hours a day. You know, people like, oh, is it okay for me to drink a glass of wine? I'm like, well, if when you drink a glass of wine it doesn't lead to you drinking 2 bottles of wine and insulting people and slapping someone around, then yeah, it's probably okay for you to have a glass of wine. You know, it's not really what it's about. That's kind of what it's about for a while, but you know, when you get down to it, it's just really about, you know, being able to be okay and not hate people for no reason. You know, like it it does really come down to being an ethical teaching, but an inside-out ethical teaching rather than a top-down ethical teaching where you're behaving ethically because you're afraid of a supernatural consequence. But that bores people if you tell people that. They don't want that. They want to like think that there's some, you know, big mystical realization that's going to like just like completely be so pleasurable and so ecstatic that, you know, like, you know, like, like Ajahn Buddhadasa said, you know, when you hear about the good, you hunger for the good. When you hear about the better, you hunger for the better. When you hear about the best, you hunger for the best. And even if you— you can even hunger for the better than the best. But the Buddha taught no hunger, you know.

**Speaker A:** So yes.

**Speaker C:** Oh wow.

**Speaker D:** Someone'S at the door.

**Speaker A:** Uh, let's Let's see who it is. I don't know this person. Well, better put pants on.

**Speaker D:** Oh wait, now we know you're not wearing pants.

**Speaker A:** Well dudes, on that note, maybe we should get going.

**Speaker C:** All right, yeah, sounds good. Thank you so much everyone, really enjoyed this call.

**Speaker D:** Thanks, everyone.

**Speaker C:** Later, guys.

**Speaker D:** All right, thanks.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, the core summary is a practical, down-to-earth discussion on **letting go of striving and concepts to find peace in the present moment through simple awareness and relaxation.**

Here are the key themes and takeaways:

**1. The Core Practice: Simplicity and Non-Striving**
*   The practice is repeatedly described as simple: **"just relax and breathe," "nothing to do, nowhere to go."**
*   A major barrier is the mind's tendency to overcomplicate—getting hung up on Pali terms, concepts, and the desire to be a "good student" or achieve a special state.
*   True progress comes from **humility** and dropping the ego's project of self-improvement. Peace is found not by changing the mind, but by changing your relationship to its contents.

**2. Understanding Nature (Dhamma)**
*   Negative mental states (anger, frustration, lust) are **natural phenomena** (like weather) that will always arise in the human organism. The goal is **not to eliminate them** but to stop identifying with them and stop fueling them through reaction.
*   The teachings of **Anicca (impermanence), Dukkha (unsatisfactoriness), and Anatta (not-self)** are framed practically:
    *   **Anicca:** Nothing can be maintained to our liking. Everything that arises will pass.
    *   **The Practice:** When a negative state arises, don't fight it. See it as a passing weather pattern, **"take shelter"** in the breath and the wholesome thought that **"everything is okay right now,"** and let it go.

**3. The Role of Effort and Attitude**
*   The "right effort" is a **light effort of attitude adjustment**, not a forceful struggle. It's the shift from "I need to fix this feeling" to "It's okay to feel this; I don't need to act on it."
*   **Kamma** is framed as the consequence of *acting out* on negative impulses. The wise choice is to "nip it in the bud" by not engaging, thus preventing the karmic wheel from spinning.
*   The practice is about **"cleaning the mind with wholesome thoughts"** (like the Triple Gem—Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha) until the mind settles into its natural, unconditioned state of okayness.

**4. Insights from the Discussion**
*   **The "Gateless Gate":** The only barrier to the present moment is our own imagination that there *is* a barrier or something else we need to do.
*   **Buddhism as an Ethical Teaching:** At its heart, it's about uprooting dissatisfaction so we don't harm ourselves or others. A society of people who are "okay with the way things are" is a peaceful one. The phrase **"everything is okay and everyone is a friend"** captures this ethos.
*   **Joy in the Sangha:** The conversation itself is seen as a wholesome activity—sharing and reinforcing wholesome conditioning, creating "beautiful music" together, and nurturing each other in the Dhamma.

**In essence, the talk emphasizes a joyful, non-dogmatic approach:** Let go of the burden of spiritual achievement, make peace with the ever-changing flow of experience by anchoring in the breath and a wholesome attitude, and find freedom in the simplicity of "just this."

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate their points about meditation, practice, and the nature of mind. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **1. Learning to Ride a Bike**
**Speaker A** uses this to describe how newcomers overcomplicate simple teachings:
> *“It's like if you're learning to ride a bike… Actually, in Chapter 32, it says that we must check the tires are inflated to the proper— it's like they don't get it. It's simple.”*
- **Meaning**: The Dharma (like riding a bike) is simple in essence, but people get lost in scholarly details (like a manual’s technicalities) instead of just practicing.

---

### **2. Swimming / Freestyle**
**Speaker B** shares an anecdote about swimming:
> *“I remember one time swimming at a pool… this guy just said to me, ‘how do you do it?’… I don’t know, you just do it.”*
- **Meaning**: Some aspects of practice (like meditation or mindfulness) can’t be fully captured in concepts; they are learned through direct experience and doing.

---

### **3. Fire as a Tool**
**Speaker A** compares mental phenomena to fire:
> *“It's like fire. It has its function… but if used incorrectly can burn us.”*
- **Meaning**: Thoughts, emotions, and even spiritual tools can be useful, but if we cling to them or misuse them, they cause suffering.

---

### **4. “Don’t throw pearls to swine”** (Biblical reference)
**Speaker A** references Jesus’ teaching:
> *“You can't always throw pearls of wisdom to swine. They just don't know what to do with it.”*
- **Meaning**: Sometimes, people aren’t ready to receive profound teachings, and it’s wise to step back and let them find their own way.

---

### **5. Two Types of Peace**
**Speaker A** distinguishes between:
- **Bodily peace** (temporary calm)
- **Peace *behind* anger/frustration** (the deeper, unattached awareness that remains undisturbed by passing emotions).
- **Meaning**: True peace isn’t about eliminating negative feelings, but about finding the stable, wise awareness that isn’t shaken by them.

---

### **6. “A chicken won’t become a duck”** (Ajahn Chah reference)
**Speaker A** quotes Ajahn Chah:
> *“Nothing we do whatsoever will turn a chicken into a duck and a duck into a chicken.”*
- **Meaning**: You can’t change the fundamental nature of reality; the mind will naturally produce all sorts of thoughts and emotions—our job is not to control them but to relate wisely.

---

### **7. The Gateless Gate**
**Speaker C** uses this Zen phrase:
> *“It's a gateless gate.”*
- **Meaning**: The barrier to the present moment is an illusion; there’s nowhere to go and nothing to achieve, yet we imagine obstacles.

---

### **8. Humpty Dumpty**
**Speaker C** references the nursery rhyme:
> *“We stop playing Humpty Dumpty because all the king’s men… can’t put him back together.”*
- **Meaning**: Trying to hold together or maintain things that are inherently impermanent (like mental states) is futile and leads to suffering.

---

### **9. Roller Coaster**
**Speaker A** uses this to describe our relationship to experience:
> *“It's like being on a roller coaster… trying to control the direction… But the reality is the roller coaster is just being a roller coaster, and enjoy the ride.”*
- **Meaning**: Life/experience unfolds on its own; effort spent trying to control it is wasted. Freedom comes from changing our attitude—relaxing and enjoying the ride.

---

### **10. Playing Music / Duet**
**Speaker A** and **Speaker C** compare Dharma discussion to making music:
> *“It's kind of like playing a duet on the same piano… Are we making beautiful music with our mouths, speaking of the Dhamma?”*
- **Meaning**: Sharing Dharma is about creating wholesome, harmonious exchange—not about winning debates or proving points.

---

### **11. Rainer Maria Rilke (Western Zen Poet)**
**Speaker D** references the poet’s work as an example of “Zen spirit” in the West:
> *“He says things like, ‘just let everything happen to you… you have no control over this world.’”*
- **Meaning**: The essence of non-control and acceptance is found across traditions, not just in Buddhism.

---

### **12. Ajahn Chah in the Graveyard**
**Speaker A** tells a story about Ajahn Chah:
> *He was sitting in a graveyard, pissing blood, and thought, “Fuck it, if I die, I die… I’m not hurting anybody… I’m just going to have a joyful heart here and now.”*
- **Meaning**: Radical acceptance and letting go of fear—even in the face of pain or death—is the heart of practice.

---

### **13. Shadows Trying to Control the Body**
**Speaker D** uses this image:
> *“Trying to judge or control… is like a shadow trying to control what the body does.”*
- **Meaning**: The ego’s attempts to control life are as insubstantial and powerless as a shadow trying to move the body casting it.

---

### **14. The Bus Coming**
**Speaker C** uses the metaphor of seeing a bus coming:
> *“You just get out of the way. You don't stand in front of the bus and get hit over and over.”*
- **Meaning**: Wisdom means recognizing danger (suffering, attachment) and stepping aside (letting go) instead of repeatedly engaging with it.

---

### **Key Themes Across the Metaphors:**
- **Simplicity vs. Overcomplication**: Bike, swimming.
- **Impermanence & Non-Control**: Chicken/duck, Humpty Dumpty, roller coaster.
- **Right Use of Tools**: Fire, pearls before swine.
- **Acceptance & Letting Go**: Ajahn Chah’s story, Rilke’s poetry, “gateless gate.”
- **Ethical & Harmonious Living**: Music duet, shadows, bus.

These metaphors and stories collectively paint a picture of a practice centered on **acceptance, simplicity, and joyful presence**, free from the burden of spiritual striving.
