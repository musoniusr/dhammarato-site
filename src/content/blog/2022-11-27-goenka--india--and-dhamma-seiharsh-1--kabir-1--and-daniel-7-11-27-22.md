### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So my mom is over there and Bangalore is my— I kind of stayed there in my teenage years. So yeah, I think I saw one of your talks when you mentioned that you had been there and I'm not sure, but I think it was one of the Babas or the Gurujis over there you'd spend some time.

**Speaker B:** If you don't mind, I have another student calling. I'll let him in on the call. Is that okay? Yes.

**Speaker C:** Hello there.

**Speaker B:** She— Hello, Daniel.

**Speaker C:** Am I saying that correctly?

**Speaker B:** Hi. I can only see above your eyebrows. That's better.

**Speaker C:** That's better. Okay, great. Good.

**Speaker B:** So, uh, This is Sri Harsh. He is in Mumbai. And Daniel, where are you?

**Speaker C:** I'm in Thailand at the moment.

**Speaker B:** Where in Thailand now?

**Speaker C:** Between Chiang Mai and Pai.

**Speaker B:** Between Chiang Mai and where? Pai.

**Speaker C:** You heard of Pai?

**Speaker B:** I haven't heard it yet.

**Speaker C:** It's a very touristy place. It's a pretty special— just repeat the.

**Speaker B:** Name of it 3 or 4 times so that I can hear it.

**Speaker C:** Bai. So B-A-I.

**Speaker B:** The locals call it pie.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Are you sure about that?

**Speaker C:** Uh, no, I'm not.

**Speaker B:** All right. Is that your chicken?

**Speaker C:** I'm sitting here on the balcony and there are the chickens in a coffee shop drinking some tea because that's the only thing I can have on this water fast. I'm actually working on my fourth day now.

**Speaker B:** Working? You look like you're really working hard to me.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, relaxing, relaxing into my— working in a hammock.

**Speaker B:** I got that.

**Speaker C:** Well, I can say that the journey to the coffee shop, which was about 5 minutes, was very, very intense on my body. Like, I had to stop about every 30 meters because my— yeah, because I was so exhausted.

**Speaker B:** Oh, it's a steep hill climb, huh?

**Speaker C:** It's more that my body barely has any fuel.

**Speaker B:** Well, never mind your body. Tell me about the hill.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, the hill is very steep, that I can tell you.

**Speaker B:** Pardon?

**Speaker C:** The hill is indeed very steep since this is in the mountains.

**Speaker B:** Okay, every time that you climb the hill, it will become a little bit easier because you're getting— you built up the strength. This is the skill that's developed actually within the legs themselves and your attitude. And right now your attitude is that the hill is a whole lot bigger than your mind is. Pretty soon you'll have the attitude, oh, I can climb this thing, there's nothing to it. Even if I have to stop and rest 3 times, that's still okay. I can do this.

**Speaker C:** I can do this. That's, that's right, that's the attitude.

**Speaker B:** Okay, uh, well, if you guys don't mind, let's do it this way. Since this is, uh, uh, time, uh, let's let, uh, Daniel— let's— you just kind of follow along because whatever we do will be a review and you need it. Okay, okay, right. Everything has to be done over and over and over again. That's the quality of simple things. There's nothing much to a drop of water, but if you keep dropping water in a bucket, pretty soon it'll fill up. And if you keep doing that long enough, you've got an ocean. Stop looking for oceans and stop looking for ponds and start looking at the this moment, this breath, and I put one step on the next.

**Speaker C:** Right, I agree.

**Speaker B:** So that's why I think you need a review, is because you've heard this before until you meet an Anagami, and then you're back into the old mindset of that.

**Speaker C:** True, true, true. I was just listening.

**Speaker B:** All right, so, um, uh, Sri Harsh, What kind of practice have you had?

**Speaker A:** I think it was in 2017 I went for my first Goenka retreat. And I mean before that— Goenka?

**Speaker B:** No, it was— Goenka, Hyderabad, Anagami, Bhikkhuni?

**Speaker A:** Yes, I've been to the one in Hyderabad was my favorite. Hyderabad was my favorite. But My first one was in Karnal, in this very small obscure one in Haryana. It's very other one. There are so many here.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there's been quite a lot of interesting things come out of the Jaipur center.

**Speaker A:** I've heard of one incident, but I mean, everybody just tells me the food is the best in the Jaipur one. That's what I know.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's possibly worth putting up with authoritarian Volunteers, if you know how to handle authorities.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I think that, uh, it took me, it took me, I had to go to like 3 or 4 or 5 of them to figure out that there's a little bit of an authority happening situation happening.

**Speaker B:** Now let me ask you this kind of question. It's since it's been 40 years since I've been in India and didn't go on retreat. How do you think that I know all about all of the things that we've just been talking about? Because, because there's an internet, that's why. But yes, I agree, Hyderabad is in fact was my favorite also, but it depends upon what time of year because it could get ferocious.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it can be hot over there.

**Speaker B:** And that one of the side benefits was that I ran across a bunch of Hindu ascetics that were practicing. One was practicing nakedness, another one was practicing the dog duty ascetic, and the dog duty is actually in the suttas. They've been doing that kind of eating food off the ground for many centuries, and it still is operational. But I saw it before I saw it in the suttas. So I went, hot dog, I know what this is all about. When I read the sutta about dog goodness then.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I mean, I just don't know why. I'm actually, I grew up in a very Hindu, in a Hindu household. Like my parents quite religious and but I don't know, it's something about the Dharma slightly appealed to me.

**Speaker B:** Um, well, the Dhamma, or the Buddha at least, appeals to Indians in general. I mean, they've actually, uh, what, usurped the entire teaching of the Buddha and turned it into just another part of the religion of, uh, Hinduism. But the third what, 24 tatankara and all kinds of stuff like that, right? And he was, uh, in fact a, um, a contemporary of, uh, Mahavira.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And also they— the name in the suttas for the Mahavira is, uh, Nata, Nataputta, I think, which gets then jokingly translated into Naga Nakaputta, which is snake, son of a snake. Yeah, rather than Mahanti, which is, uh, what? Oh, peace and quiet. It has to do with the word nocturne. It has to do with evening time, and so therefore sleep and rest and slumber, that sort of thing. And yet he didn't live any of that up. I mean, they were really, really heavy duty into austerities at those times. By sleeping on the ground and walking around barefoot. They've got it quite stylized now. The Jains will actually carry a cane, or actually a little broom kind of thing, yeah, to sweep the path in front of them. And they were wearing COVID-19 masks years ago.

**Speaker A:** So that the germs don't go inside. They don't want to take any life, so they just wear Masks.

**Speaker C:** Right.

**Speaker A:** COVID, they've been doing that for a long time.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so they took that Panna Tipata Vairamani very seriously.

**Speaker A:** I actually used to have quite a lot of questions about— I hope my audio and everything is fine.

**Speaker B:** It's fine. Can you hear me okay? Because I've had complaints and I've got the microphone just right here, so I think that it should be able to— I'm not looking it up, looking at it, but it's looking directly at me.

**Speaker A:** So actually, I— okay, wait, I kind of forgot my question.

**Speaker B:** That's all right. I'm just very happy. In fact, I've had many Indian students over the time, and that I very much enjoy reminiscing. And here you are with two sides of it, because most of the people that I meet that have had some goenka are doing it from the centers in the West, like in California. I've got some friends there. And here you are doing double duty as being in India and being into goenka.

**Speaker A:** Well, I mean, You know, to be very honest, I heard one of your talks and you spoke about Goenka Ji not being there anymore and that actually creating a sort of a barrier between the teacher and the student in a sense. And another thing which really struck me, like that really I felt that, because I felt that, you know, that was one thing. Another thing I felt that English was not his native language. Language, and I was luckily lucky enough to understand him when he gave his Hindi discourses. I did feel like there was a slight discrepancy, or a, you know, there's— it's because also like there are videos and it's tough to put into a question, you know.

**Speaker B:** If you, if you don't mind, let's turn the video recorder on. Is that— oh, I— we've actually got it on already. It looked— it didn't show on the screen, so Well, I think that you're actually correct that part of the problem of teaching the Goenka method in the West was that his English was not good enough to convey the subtleties that he did teach with the Hindus. And also there was cultural differences that he didn't quite understand. And possibly I was one of the very first Westerners who spent a lot of time there in Igatpuri anyway. And so one of the things that didn't sit well with him is when Indian women would bring their castanets or cymbals and their mala beads for their arms and their trinkets and all kinds of stuff like that. I actually saw that it happened when he was, you know, let's put that stuff down, that we're here. So that's when he started emphasizing, please do it our way. Oh, we've got Kabir calling. Well, let's just add him in if you don't mind.

**Speaker C:** Hello Kabir, nice to meet you.

**Speaker B:** Hi, likewise. Hello Kabir. Hi. Uh, I went ahead and added you, uh, onto this call, which is kind of a spontaneous call, and we were already talking about, uh, things in India, especially Goenka. So where are you located now? Well, I'm in Madrid in Spain. Okay. All right, so if you don't mind, just kind of listen along to what we're talking about. Sure. Is that okay? All right, so yeah, uh, back to Sri Harsh. The, um, how much of the Goenka retreats have you done? How many How many 10-day retreats have you done with him, with that group?

**Speaker A:** I've done— so I went to different centers across the country and I did, I think I've done like 7 of them and I've done 2 sthavas, like I would— the serving, serving thing. The serving thing was quite like a new experience for me, different also. So I did a few.

**Speaker B:** All right, so you're pretty well steeped in the thing. That's okay. So what we were actually beginning to do was to write an apology for Goenka rather than attacking him. Okay, and so the whole idea is, is that much of the problem had to do with the making it— because you know that in the West that Goenka's retreats are known as a boot camp, like it's a really heavy-duty kind of thing there. But in India, it's already way laid back, and so just getting them up to doing the practice is all that needs to be done. But that the Westerners take that differently and they wind up working really hard. And that is one of the words that Goenka uses, this very characteristic in English, and that is, you've got to.

**Speaker A:** Work.

**Speaker B:** You got to work. Well, that actually does fit in very well with the Hindi, but it does not fit well in English, and it does not fit well with Westerners, because then they get back into the struggles that the first grader does. You know, the kids are told to do their homework or learn all of this, and the kid is struggling with it because it's beyond his intellectual capabilities to do so. And so it's better to— if you're going to fail, don't fail happily. You have to fail miserably, and you've got to look like that you're really working so that you can get forgiveness for your failure. And that's very strong in the West, but it's not so strong in Asia. That mentality of proving to the authorities how tough you are is not part of the Hindi culture. And you could almost say that a possibility for that has to do with the Christianity and the idea of suffering. For your sins, that Jesus suffered in your behalf, right? And so here's all of that kind of suffering quality that the Western mindset has built into it. And a lot of that then is promoted by the Buddhism that has come to the West, that was actually.

**Speaker C:** Uh.

**Speaker B:** Quite directly can be stated that Goenka had a major influence on that, intentionally so, with all of the centers that they put out. But in fact, they didn't— when they built the centers, and for instance in California, or here's one in Thailand, the thing that was missing was Goenka himself, because he was already dead when these places were built. Yeah, okay. So, um, That's part of the problem, is that it goes back to the point that I'm making, is that Goenka had every opportunity and could have developed a lineage and developed a Sangha, which he didn't do. That he concentrated on Dharma without presenting much Buddha or much Sangha. And I think that that had to do with the fact that when he was in Burma, he took what he could get from it before the Burmese government kicked all of the Indians out. You know that story, don't you? Okay, so I don't have to go into that. Okay, so he was actually almost forcibly deported. He was one of the last to go because he had so much money, and still he didn't get a decent enough education because after all he was only a layman anyway, but he saw gold. He saw something so valuable that he had to take it back to India with him and set up retreat centers. He also had some fairly wealthy good friends that helped him to build it. So when I was there, they didn't even have a stupa or a decent meditation hall built. That they were just doing that big circle that's got pie-shaped little rooms in it, was all that they had in those days. But I could tell that Goenka had something enormously valuable. That's why I stayed and kept going back to retreat after retreat after retreat. But one of the things I noticed was is that he did not want like is built into the Sangha of Bhikkhus. He did not want to bring anyone up to his level and train them as a teacher. He didn't train anybody. He didn't sit in the back of a Dhamma hall listening to his student teach Dharma, which, by the way, puts a whole lot of pressure on that student to get it right, having the teacher in the audience. I know, I've been there, done that on several occasions.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so that would be the mistake that he made, but it wasn't a mistake that he made, it was lack of knowledge. He didn't see the whole process of taking a young monk under your wing, training him with both the physical and the mental And then about 10 years or so in, depending upon what you can see in the student, you start putting them into the teaching role. This is a necessary part of the practice because really the Dharma is not learned until you can teach it. Yeah, but if you can't teach what you know, then you really don't know it very well. And then in fact Because we know that we can't teach something that we forgot, we'll go look it up because we know it's important enough to tell the student. It should also be important enough that I know where I got it. That's an important part also, is that we become more familiar with the Dhamma by teaching it, but then we get even more familiar with living it because now we're kind of an example. That, and when Goenka would do that with 4, 5, 6, maybe 10 people, then he would have a second generation, a Sangha. That's what we're trying to develop here, is the second generation Sangha for the Western world.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and the East. Come on.

**Speaker B:** Yes, okay, for, uh, for India for sure. Uh, where is the place in India? It's actually not far. It's up on the huts, uh, on the other side of Pune, where, uh, there is a whole collection, like millions of Buddhists. Do you know that area? There's, there's a new community of Buddhism in India that was started by, uh, uh, Anbaka.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, yeah, that's in Maharashtra only. It's all these, uh, Buddhist teaching teaching.

**Speaker B:** Huge population, huge population up there. Yes, okay, so maybe you can take your Bollywood up there and spend some time with those people. There you will possibly find Sangha. If Anapanasati did it correctly, it becomes Sangha. That's actually the top. When people think about the Triple Gem of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha, they get it to the point of, well, I don't know much about Sangha, but I know I got to study Buddha and Buddhism or the Dharma, and if I study it very well, I will wind up having the Buddha, okay, the awakening. Except that they've got it actually upside down, that people are not even going to be interested in the Dharma if they hadn't already started to wake up. Start coming out of it, and so the becoming a Buddha is something that we actually practice doing, rather than hoping for someday in the future. And so when we look at it like that, we recognize that all the practice of the Dharma and the mind of the Buddha are actually the same thing. The Dhamma is actually how to put your mind in the state that you can handle, just like I was talking about Daniel and his steep hill a while ago. All right, there it is. That's the whole point of it. And so the Sangha is then the collection of those people who have that kind of noble mind. That's what Sangha is, is that it's a collection of people who have a noble mind. And that's one of the things that we don't have in the West, and when I mean the West, I'm not specifically thinking of India, but it's true there, at least in Bombay or Mumbai.

**Speaker C:** Absolutely. Dhammarato, can I ask you a question? Uh-huh. So you've been doing the online Sangha for like 3, 4 years now, is it?

**Speaker B:** Well, yes, with some fits and starts and whatnot like that, but it's rolling now. I think that has a lot to do with the fact that there are now enough students who can get involved so that the heavy lifting is shared by several people rather than it falling on the shoulders of one person. Because then when one person is doing too much, they begin to think of this as mine. Yeah, but several people are sharing it. They get the idea that all this is ours.

**Speaker C:** And yeah, have you been able to get anyone to your level to begin teaching as well? Just out of curiosity. I know like 3, 4 years is a short time.

**Speaker B:** That actually, I would say that I have 2 students that I am strongly encouraging in teaching.

**Speaker C:** And who are those students?

**Speaker B:** Well, that's Scott and Danny. Okay, those who have started taking on a teaching role. But more to the point, I want a whole lot of people to start spending time with people who have been Buddhist their whole lives, most specifically those who have developed devoted or dedicated or enthusiastic for their whole life, like becoming ordained. Especially if you're ordained around people who ordained for a long time, you find a whole different world, a whole different environment. And so I strongly recommend to the students, and not only that, but for the sake of the Open Sangha Foundation, I also encourage each one of them to write something up. About their experiences at the wat. And the idea is to get people into the wat so that the regular— the better kind of training can be done by Thai monks, not me. Okay. And that right now we have two such situations, uh, in that regard. And that is that, uh, um, Eric has already become Samadhi. He's already got the first level of ordination done, and he just came in July. He's been here since July, but he was also spending about 6 months in a wat in Seattle, Washington before that. Okay. And then the other one is Robert. Robert has just come out of a retreat at Deepabhavana and has met with Achan Po and Dhammavitu, and it looks like Dhammavitu is taking him under his wing. Dhammavitu is the main Western teacher now at Wat Soan Mokkh. And so Robert is at Wat Soan Mokkh now with Dhammavitu. And Achan Dhammavitu, by the way, he's been an Englishman, but he's been a monk now 29 years.

**Speaker C:** Oh, and is that the same abbot as the one in Royette?

**Speaker B:** Yes, this is the one that— no, that's where Eric is. Eric is at the one in Royette, and he has sent quite a number of photos. It looks like that he was around someone that had a camera because there's a lot of photos of him in various things. And also I can tell the difference between which photos were taken at Wat Soi Nong and which photos were taken at the temple I've never been to in Uppaya. Uh, okay, so, um, anyway, that's Sangha for you, because, uh, there— let's use just a simple idea of either mathematics or music. Either one of them, every good student of mathematics has had several teachers throughout his time. Music is the same way, sports is the same way; we have various trainers at various times to bring ourselves up to the athletic ability. It takes a whole lot of professors to help a student come up to PhD physics quality knowledge of telescopes, etc. We need several teachers. And yet in Hindi, we have this idea of, "Oh, the Satguru," and everybody is around the Satguru, maybe hundreds of people, and yet nobody gets close to the Satguru, because even his best students are not good enough teacher for me, and part of that is the Sadhguru, through that tradition, has not developed the Sangha that needs to be developed under him. And sometimes that happens and sometimes it doesn't. It's kind of haphazard in Hinayana. After all, going back to Jivaka, it wasn't part of his early tradition. He was Jain. And the Jains do have a kind of Sangha, but it's not open. You really have to stay in Jain in order to get that. And he had left the Jain, I think, pretty early. I'm not sure about that part of his history, but he comes back all Buddhist and everything. And so stopping his Burmese experience and go ordained as a Jain monk. May have been a better thing for him to do to get some interconnections between the Jain and the Buddhism, because after all, they're brothers and sisters anyway from that same period of time, that the Buddha was actually a student of Mahavira who set up that system anyway. And so after that, he could come back and then take on the retreat model and teach, and I imagine he would have been a much better teacher, is that because he was missing some of the key ingredients. Sorry about that, but that's not necessarily a criticism, it's a matter of circumstances. And I'm really glad that Goenka is out there teaching what he's teaching, and the students who are devoting their time and effort, everybody who's in that racket already knows the value of what is being taught there. It's just got some, let us say, some holes. It's more like Swiss cheese.

**Speaker A:** I may say something. I actually had a question about this, which is that I found that like in the Goenka retreat, there was no— as in all of the retreat, the practice was important Obviously, as you said, there are holes and each student kind of independently has to use their brain and kind of like maneuver through the different assistant teachers, different points of view. Someone will say something, someone will say something else in the next retreat, and you're like, wait, what's going on? But then you kind of Google it and you do various things and you figure out certain answers. You find Dhammarato and you find others on the Dhamma giving certain answers. I had a question about a particular topic which is kind of— it kind of bothered me a bit for a long time. And it was this whole— I don't want to call it an obsession, that's a little bit of a harsh word, but about the stages of insight. Because I felt like I didn't know anything about this in the Goenka Buddhist teaching. They didn't speak of it. But I felt that there was this certain pressure, like once I started looking at people talking about it, that, you know, this Some people like, you know, saying that, like, you know, trying— I mean, codifying the pro— I mean, I'm guessing for a noob like myself, like a novice, uh, you know, it puts a lot of pressure to know that am I at which stage I'm at.

**Speaker B:** And like, oh, got it. Okay. All right. So let's take that as a short topic and we'll take it on later, uh, in a more full way. But, um, The first point is that there were no 16 stages of insight in the time of the Buddha, that it got started with the Pā����asati, Samadhi, Marga, which is about the 3rd century AD, and then got full-blown into 16 stages of insight in the Visuddhimagga, which was written about 500 AD, and that the Burmese like the Sri Lankans, are very much into— in fact, it's a Sri Lankan influence on Burma about that Visuddhimagga because it was written locally. It was written in Sri Lanka. And the reason that it was written there is because they already had all of the archives of everything written down. They had been accumulating that for hundreds of years, but it wasn't very well organized. And so Acharya Buddhaghosa, who was Brahmin, by the way, Brahmin through and through, went to Sri Lanka to help organize a lot of the stuff that became the commentaries. And in that, he then produced this Suttimagga. Okay, so that's the history of that. That might be enough for you to get relief of, "Oh, I don't have to worry at all about the 16 stages of insight, they're not even in the Suttas, they didn't come out of the time of the Buddha." It was 1,000 years later than the time of the Buddha. Okay? And so we don't really need to do very much with it at all, because in fact you probably heard also a kind of a talk, a relationship between the two words Vipassana and Samatha, right? That distinction did not— also did not exist in the time of the Buddha. That this is a later thing. And in fact, the word Samatha does actually appear in the suttas and means something in particular, but the word Vipassana rarely comes out of any literature that was produced from the time of the Buddha itself. And yet they're all hot on Vipassana meditation, right? They call it that. And so one of the ways that we work with it here is that we're going to reset the whole thing, including the language that we use, because what we actually are practicing is Anapanasati, not Vipassana. And that the relationship that we hold with Anapanasati, within the teaching of Anapanasati for everyone is that whatever the distinctions are between Samatha and Vipassana are like two wings of a bird and you have to use them both to get off the ground. There is no distinction between one or the other. The distinction between the two is artificial and comes by people sitting around the campfire arguing about it. 1,000 years after the time of the Buddha. And it's not necessary to think that way, that in fact, in the Suttas it talks about the direct path, the absolute direct path is the way that it's taught, Ekamarga, okay? Now, what does that mean? Well, think about a triangle that has an A, a B, and a C, and the hypotenuse is between A and C, and BC form a right triangle, and you're up at A. So how do you get to C? Well, if you do Samatha and Vipassana separately, that means that you do the Samatha probably first and go down to B, and then you do the Vipassana all the way over to C. And we already know, because we've all had enough math to know, that the shortest distance between two things is a straight line. Not a side journey. And yet almost everything that we do is we do— we go to B in order to get to C when we could have gone straight to C in the first place. And that is so true in all cases, but the most obvious one is about this Vipassana versus Samatha. Now, the Buddha himself did not understand the nature of the mind, and so when he was practicing, before he got to the jhāna, he'd already been through all the jhānas. If the Buddha refuses and rejects the Jhanas themselves, by themselves, and then goes off to the Jains and Mahayana and spends, what, a couple of years there or so, that means that Jhanas are highly overrated. They're highly overrated in regards to, "Oh, you've got to have the fourth Jhana, blah, blah, blah, and the higher numbers you have." So wait a minute, 4 is not enough, let's have 8. I must have 9, you know, that kind of mentality that Westerners have, always looking for more and more and more. And yet the Suttas specifically say that the first Jhana is the key. Now the first Jhana is the key to enlightenment. If you can be in first Jhana all the time, you're in a state of Sukkha, you're in a state of pleasure, which is exactly opposite of the Dukkha, and that's his whole teaching anyway. Is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Get out of it. Yeah, when you're fully out of the Dukkha, you're in First Jhana. You don't need anything more than to be able to control. You're the First Jhana.

**Speaker A:** I wanted to ask you what the First Jhana is, because that's a little bit— I'm not sure.

**Speaker B:** It has 6 attributes in some suttas and 5 attributes in other suttas. The distinction or the difference, that sixth one, is the body is relaxed. Okay, so even though it's left out of many of the definitions, you would expect that that would be a good thing to add. That in fact, that step 4 of Anapanasati, which Goenka talks about, the relaxation of the body, is done through the scanning, which is actually the experience. Of the body, except that he's got it done in a very stylized way. So we're going to practice third step, Anapanasati, or third item on the list quite frequently. It's a great deal part of the practice. We need to get into doing that, but doing in a natural way, in the sense of the intention is to find where we're not relaxed and relax it there. Other than scanning. You see, Goenka doesn't hardly even talk about this relaxation, finding the tensions and relax. He does a little bit, but not as that's the intention, that the students begin to think that, oh, I have to be able to scan and scan and scan and get better at scanning and scanning and scanning until I get this white sheet kind of all one blob kind of thing, and that's all there is to it. And in that regard, that's still missing the Vipassana part. The Vipassana part is to not just investigate the body, but to find where the tensions are, find where the non-relaxation is, and intentionally relax that. So if we can then see, going back to the question of the First Jhana, The first thing, which is the most important quality of the first Jhana, is to have the mind free from hindrances. Sutta after sutta after sutta that's mentioned. With Goenka, he only lightly touches it, but it's absolutely the first thing. And in many, many suttas, the Buddha talks about it in the sense of unwholesome thoughts. We have to have the ability to see the unwholesome thoughts and then eradicate them, throw them out, put the mind into a gladdened state, make the mind bright. In Anapanasati, it's referred to as gladdening the mind, gladdening or brightening the mind, and we're not actually talking about necessarily changing the objects of We talk about changing the mind state, so we investigate the mind state. Is the mind dull? Is it sharp? Is it mediocre? Is it exalted? What kind of mind state do we have? Arahant, Arhat, is the kind of mind state that we can have. We bring the mind up by brightening it or gladdening it, and we bring it up to a higher state. Of processing, almost like being able to make the fire hotter. So the state of mind is, is that the mind, is it in a state of smoldering? Is it in the stage of kindling? Is it in the stage of hot coals? Is it in the state of Anagami? Or is it.

**Speaker C:** Roaring? It's a kind of state of mind.

**Speaker B:** You can have, you can investigate at the same time.


### Summary

Based on the provided transcript, here is a summary of the Dhamma talk with Dhammarato (Speaker B) and Sangha friends:

**Core Theme:** The talk centers on building a sustainable **Sangha (spiritual community)** and correcting perceived gaps in modern meditation movements, using the Goenka tradition as a primary case study.

**Key Discussion Points:**

1.  **Critique & Context of the Goenka Tradition:** Dhammarato acknowledges the immense value S.N. Goenka brought to the West but identifies key shortcomings:
    *   **Lack of a Living Sangha:** Goenka did not establish a true lineage by training students to become teachers themselves. This created a teacher-student barrier, especially after his passing.
    *   **Cultural & Linguistic Gaps:** Goenka's English and understanding of Western culture were limited, sometimes leading to a misinterpretation of his instruction to "work" as striving or struggle, which can be counterproductive.
    *   **Incomplete Framework:** The tradition focuses heavily on *Dharma* (technique) but underemphasizes the *Buddha* (the awakened state/mind) and the *Sangha* (community of noble friends).

2.  **The Vital Importance of Sangha:** Dhammarato stresses that spiritual growth requires a community, not just solitary practice. A true Sangha consists of people developing a "noble mind" who support and teach each other. He emphasizes that one truly learns the Dhamma by teaching it.

3.  **Practical Steps for Building Sangha:** He shares that his online Sangha is now evolving because the work is shared. He is actively encouraging students (naming Scott and Danny) to take on teaching roles. Furthermore, he strongly advocates for students to immerse themselves in established monastic communities (e.g., in Thailand) to receive deeper training.

4.  **Clarification on Advanced Concepts (for Sri Harsh):** In response to a student's anxiety about the "stages of insight":
    *   **Historical Context:** He explains that the detailed 16 stages of insight and the strict dichotomy between *Samatha* (tranquility) and *Vipassana* (insight) are later commentaries (5th century CE), not from the Buddha's time.
    *   **The Direct Path:** The Buddha's path, especially **Ānāpānasati** (mindfulness of breathing), is presented as an integrated, direct path. The goal is not to chase advanced *jhānas* but to cultivate the **First Jhāna**—a mind free from hindrances, relaxed, gladdened, and unified.
    *   **Core Practice:** The essence is using mindfulness to detect tension (physical and mental) and intentionally relax it, thereby gladdening the mind and moving it out of *dukkha* (suffering) and into *sukha* (pleasure/bliss).

**Overall Tone:** The talk is conversational, mentoring, and corrective. Dhammarato blends personal anecdote, historical analysis, and practical advice to guide students away from common pitfalls (striving, over-intellectualizing stages) and toward a sustainable, community-based practice focused on the direct cultivation of a joyful, awakened mind in the present moment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the provided transcript, the talk uses several metaphors and stories to illustrate its points about meditation practice, teaching lineages, and the Buddhist path.

Here are the key metaphors and stories identified:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The Hill Climb:** Used by **Speaker B (likely Dhammarato)** when addressing **Speaker C (Daniel)** about his exhaustion during a water fast.
    *   **Metaphor:** The steep hill Daniel must climb to the coffee shop represents a difficult challenge in practice or life.
    *   **Meaning:** The point is that repeated effort ("every time that you climb the hill") builds strength and skill, and one's attitude must shift from seeing the challenge as insurmountable ("the hill is a whole lot bigger than your mind") to confident ("I can climb this thing").

2.  **The Drop of Water Filling a Bucket / Creating an Ocean:** Used by **Speaker B** to emphasize consistent, moment-to-moment practice.
    *   **Metaphor:** A single drop of water is insignificant, but persistent dripping first fills a bucket and, over vast time, can create an ocean.
    *   **Meaning:** Don't look for the grand results ("oceans" or "ponds") immediately. Focus on the small, simple, present-moment actions ("this breath," "one step on the next") repeated consistently.

3.  **Swiss Cheese:** Used by **Speaker B** to describe the Goenka meditation system.
    *   **Metaphor:** The system is like Swiss cheese—valuable and substantive, but with holes.
    *   **Meaning:** While the Goenka method is valuable and teaches important things, it is incomplete or has flaws (e.g., lack of a developed teacher lineage/sangha, cultural translation issues).

4.  **Two Wings of a Bird:** Used by **Speaker B** when discussing *samatha* (tranquility) and *vipassana* (insight).
    *   **Metaphor:** *Samatha* and *vipassana* are like the two wings of a bird.
    *   **Meaning:** Both are necessary and must be used together to "get off the ground" (to make progress on the path). Treating them as separate or sequential paths is an artificial and inefficient construct.

5.  **The Triangle (Hypotenuse as the Direct Path):** Used by **Speaker B** to critique the artificial separation of *samatha* and *vipassana*.
    *   **Metaphor:** The spiritual path is likened to a right triangle. Point A is the start, point C is the goal (enlightenment). Going down to point B (mastering *samatha*) and then across to C (doing *vipassana*) is the indirect path. The direct path (*ekamagga*) is the hypotenuse, going straight from A to C.
    *   **Meaning:** The "direct path" of practices like Anapanasati integrates qualities from the start, making the separate, sequential development of *samatha* and *vipassana* an unnecessary detour.

6.  **States of a Fire:** Used by **Speaker B** when describing the quality of mind.
    *   **Metaphor:** The mind's state is compared to the stages of a fire: smoldering, kindling, hot coals, or roaring.
    *   **Meaning:** One should investigate and understand the current energy and clarity of the mind, with the goal of cultivating a "brightened" or "gladdened" state (a "roaring" fire) conducive to insight.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **Goenka's Background and Choices:** **Speaker B** tells a story about S.N. Goenka's life to explain perceived gaps in his teaching system.
    *   **Story:** Goenka learned meditation in Burma but was forced to leave during the expulsion of Indians. He took the valuable Dhamma to India but, as a layman, did not establish a traditional monastic lineage (*sangha*). He didn't train successor teachers to his level, focusing instead on the *dhamma* (teachings) without fully developing the *sangha* (community) pillar.
    *   **Purpose:** To explain why the Goenka organization may lack a living teacher-student lineage and why students might feel a "barrier."

2.  **Encounter with Hindu Ascetics in Hyderabad:** **Speaker B** shares a personal anecdote.
    *   **Story:** While at the Hyderabad center, he encountered Hindu ascetics practicing extreme austerities mentioned in the suttas, like nakedness or the "dog duty" (eating food off the ground). He saw this *before* reading about it in the texts.
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate the living continuity of ancient ascetic practices in India and to connect personal experience with scriptural learning.

3.  **Jain Ascetic Practices (Pre-dating COVID):** **Speaker B** references Jain monastic practices.
    *   **Story:** He notes that Jain monks have long worn masks and carried brooms to avoid harming insects, a practice of non-violence (*ahimsa*) that predates COVID-19 precautions by centuries.
    *   **Purpose:** To highlight the rigor and historical depth of the Indian ascetic tradition from which Buddhism emerged.

4.  **The Historical Development of the "16 Stages of Insight":** **Speaker B** provides a historical narrative.
    *   **Story:** He explains that the detailed "16 stages of insight" and the strong *samatha/vipassana* dichotomy are not from the Buddha's time. They were developed later, in texts like the *Visuddhimagga* (5th century CE), compiled by the Brahmin scholar Buddhaghosa in Sri Lanka.
    *   **Purpose:** To relieve **Speaker A's** anxiety about these stages, arguing they are later scholastic additions, not essential core teachings one must obsess over.

5.  **The Buddha's Own Path (Rejecting the Jhānas Alone):** **Speaker B** references the biography of the Buddha.
    *   **Story:** He reminds the listeners that the Buddha mastered the jhānas but then rejected them as insufficient for final enlightenment, leading him to practice severe asceticism before discovering the Middle Way.
    *   **Purpose:** To argue that deep jhānic states are sometimes "overrated" and that the **first jhāna**—characterized by freedom from hindrances and pleasure (*sukkha*)—is the key, sustainable foundation for the path, not just a stepping stone to higher states.
