### Transcript


**Speaker A:** No.

**Speaker B:** All right, so today is Sunday afternoon, December the 3rd, and, uh, in UK it's, uh, Sunday morning, late Sunday morning sometime. So, uh, Jesus has a question because he's been spending a lot of time in various watching things. Hey, Zeus, go ahead and re-ask your question.

**Speaker A:** Well, question is, for example, when.

**Speaker B:** Let'S.

**Speaker A:** Say, someone, or I have a concern, or I feel bad one day, or have a fear, or have something, and I ask for some advice, and when people, some friends will give me like, reply of, "No problem, everything is Anicca." "No problem, everything is empty, everything is your mind." And I don't find that much helpful, and I don't know if I can say, if I, this is bypassing of the person, or is them, I don't know what to think about that.

**Speaker B:** Oh, well that's a little bit different than the question that you ask, before.

**Speaker A:** Really?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you were talking about people coming to the watch with their problems, I guess, and that's what they're told. Is that.

**Speaker A:** What you meant? Well, it's just more like the usual. I heard a lot, I heard a lot, like when someone goes to just asking a question of, I feel bad, 'Well, it's a lot of noise.' 'I feel bad,' or, 'I have this problem,' and the reply they receive from other persons is like, 'Everything is your mind.' And the person, or this student or something, they get like, 'Okay, that was not helpful,' or— and— I see a lot of bypassing with this. I don't know if this is bypassing, like, "No problem, everything is Anicca," or "Everything is empty." And then, but how— sorry for my English, but how do you—.

**Speaker B:** How do we handle that? Okay, I got it.

**Speaker A:** No, I don't know.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** So, The first thing that I have to say about that is, first off, that's really excellent advice, and it's useless advice. It's useless because it's a statement and it's a one-time shot. But if the person who is asking that question, then goes away, and every time they ask themselves that question, they would answer it with everything is Anicca, everything is empty, then that would be the solution. But the problem is that we want a better help. My first thought about that is that people go to the doctor and all they're going to get from doctor is a prescription for taking pills. And it's quite possible that if people actually take those pills on the schedule that the doctor gives them, that it will give them some benefit. It's also possible that if they take the pills that the doctor gives, and quite often people don't, that it's not really the right medicine because the doctor didn't spend enough time to find out what the real issue was. But you could go so far as to say that everything is Anicca, everything is empty, would be the answer to any of life's questions if we would only apply it. If we would only take that pill on a regular schedule. Now, another point that we can make about that is that wats are very, very much like mental hospitals, or in fact any kind of hospital, and that everybody that's in that hospital is mentally ill. And so people go around, they go to the wat, and they start asking questions, and who they're asking questions to is generally mentally ill. Themselves. And so be careful of who you ask questions to when you're at a wat, because most of the people who were there came there because they wanted something. They're not there to help other people. They're not the doctor. It's like going into the doctor's office and seeing a whole waiting room full of people, and, oh, I'm in a hurry. And so you start asking the people in the waiting room what their remedy for your illness is, and as soon as you hear something, you leave and you never actually got to speak to the real doctor. Would that possibly be the situation? That the people that you're talking to are the people who were there, who have gotten a little bit of Buddhism, but they give you a quick answer without giving you the fact that this has to be repeated over and over and over again until it begins to sink in. You've got to take the medicine over and over and over again. When do you need it? When do you need to take the medicine that everything is empty and everything is Anicca? Anytime any problem comes up, that's when you need to take the medicine. You should just tell yourself, hey, everything's all right, everything is fine, that in fact everything is all right and everything is fine is based upon that quality of everything is changing and nothing really matters. But we're looking for something a little bit better than that. Another way of saying that would be Everything is Anicca, everything is empty. Another way to say it is that, oh, whatever it is then is not my business. It's not mine, right? And Anicca and emptiness, really what the emptiness is, is that it's empty of self, that there is no inherent real self there. The example that could be used from Nargajuna with King Milanda is that the chariot that King Milanda rides in really does not exist. All that really exists is a long piece of wood and a basket and some reins and harnesses and some wood-shaped and round objects that we would call a wheel. But really, the chariot— there's no chariot-ness in the chariot. It really doesn't exist except in the mind of the people who are riding in the chariot, or that they see it. Another way of thinking, in fact more modern times, would be an automobile. Imagine that the automobile is sitting in the front yard, but it's all in bits and pieces and parts. The engine is sitting over there, but it's just the engine block because the pistons have been taken out. And the wheels are over there, but they've got the rims and the tires and the tubes laying in a pile with all the lug nuts thrown all over the yard. And the seats are hanging from a rope in a tree. All right, so with that kind of conditioning there's not much of a car there. Why? Because the quality of the car has to do when everything comes back together to make a whole, or to make the car a self. Except that it's not really a self, it's just bits and pieces and car parts and whatnot like that. All right, that the— there is no such thing as karnes There's no such thing as chariot-ness. There's actually no such thing as house-ness. And what we have for a house instead is all of the parts and all of the components, but many of those components in the house or in the car or in the chariot can also be broken down. For instance, in the chariot, the basket is not really a basket. It's just plants that people have woven together, and there's no basket to it except in the mind of the human. The human is the one who puts everything together. They're the ones who try to make something permanent that's actually temporary. They're the ones who were trying to put meaning in the chariot when in fact The bits and pieces and parts of the chariot in and of themselves, each one of them has no meaning of being a chariot. No matter how many of those car parts, or no matter how many of those chariot parts you go to look at, you're not going to find a chariot or chariotness or the essence of chariot anywhere there. It is all a concept. All right, now when we can actually see that, then it's valuable. But when we don't see it, when somebody says, oh, everything is empty, that doesn't really mean anything to somebody who has meaning in things. Hello, Daniel.

**Speaker C:** Hello, everybody.

**Speaker B:** So That's the issue, Jesus, is that the answer to the question is not really meaningful to you without giving you how to apply it. For instance, you go to the doctor and he gives you medicine, but it's not medicine that you take in a pill form. It's an ointment that you have to rub on your body, on the sore or whatever. But without the proper instructions, You get that bottle of medicine and you drink it, and now you're much worse off than you were before. So this is the problem with going to the Wat and hearing people say everything is empty and everything is meaningless, as if that's going to solve the problem. And really it's not, because that's just, you know, That comment, everything is empty and everything is meaningless, in itself is also empty and meaningless. And nature doesn't mean a thing.

**Speaker A:** And it actually can be even toxic, you know, as you said, if I drink the— because if I am feeling really horrible and it's like everything Anicca, it's like, oh, come on. Can be even like infuriating. I don't know how to explain it.

**Speaker B:** It's like, you know, all right, but if you would apply that medicine right then and there in a proper way, then your response to it is, yeah man, everything is meaningless. I don't know what I was on about. Everything is Anicca. Or another way of saying it, everything is not my business. I'm trying to make something out of something that's really— there's nothing there. And that you don't like that answer because you don't know how to apply it. Now, there is a way of talking. The reason that I'm saying it this way is because there's actually kind of two ways to practice. One of them is to divert. And the other one is to abandon. And this is the quality of abandoning. All right. It's not my business. Everything is Anicca. Everything is empty. Let's just abandon it. And the other process, which would be more valuable to people in that situation, would be taking the diversion.

**Speaker A:** Method.

**Speaker B:** And the diversion method means to change what you're thinking, like, "Oh, poor me, my chariot's broken." And so you come to the chariot repair shop and say, "Oh, poor me, my chariot is broken." And the chariot shop owner says, "That's okay, there was not much of a chariot there in the first place, it doesn't mean anything." You know, the chariots are chariots for a little while, and then they're not chariots again, they're Anicca. That's not going to help very much to the guy who wants his chariot repaired. So, the diversion would be to change it, to change a frame of reference, in the sense of, "Oh, the chariot is broken," is not enough. Let's go look at what's broken about the chariot. Let's go see that it's not actually the chariot is broken, but there is a little port or a little feature. Maybe the chariot's got a flat tire or something like that. Or maybe you can ride that— what, you're at the Wat, so you've gotten a little further along, you don't need the chariot, or you're already at the stage of the chariot's empty, it doesn't mean a thing. Especially it's empty when I'm not sitting in it. So, that's an important quality that it only has meaning when we add a 'me' to it. But before we can come to that conclusion and let that be the best medicine, a better medicine would be diversion rather than abandoning. So the abandoning is not me, not mine, not my business. It's empty. It's Anicca. Or another way of saying it is that because of Anicca, you either have Dukkha with a self because it has meaning, or if there is Anatta, there is no self, then it doesn't matter if the chariots are broken or not because I'm not in it, I'm not riding it. I'm not going to write it. All right, so let's get that thoroughly understood on this part about we're abandoning it, and that was not good advice for you. The other advice would be to divert, to make a change, to take whatever you've got, to find out whatever it is that's on your mind that's bothering you and start working or fixing that in particular. Now, the way that we talk about that in the suttas is gladdening the mind. I have a lot of students who come to me and listen to what I have to say, and then they'll ask a really stupid question like, well, I was taught to empty the mind, to make it empty, to make it, you know, And the answer to that is you don't have the skill to abandon the mind. You don't have the skill to empty the mind completely. That is much more like that the beginner's mind is like a big freighter, a big ship, an aircraft carrier, something like that. And guess what? Big ships don't have brakes. You can't stop one, even if it's going at 1 knot. Nevertheless, it's going 35 knots. You can't stop it. It's heavy, it's got momentum, it's moving. But what we can do is we can steer it. We can move it out of the way. We can see that it's heading directly for another vessel. Let's make a diversion. Let's steer it out of the way. This is really the better practice, and this is actually the practice that we need to practice for quite a while to keep coming back to. Oh, my mind is heading for a disaster, is heading right into the pier, is going to be grounded, it's going to hit a rock the way that I'm going. Instead of trying to stop it We're going to divert it. So this is also the practice of changing the unwholesome thoughts to wholesome thoughts, is what we practice. And that's what the Buddha recommends. The Buddha doesn't recommend exactly just to stop the mind because it's got unwholesome thoughts. We can't do that. But what we can do is divert the mind, change the mind, steer the mind out of the unwholesome into the wholesome. We can begin to gladden the mind, we can begin to change the mind's wording. This is the real, this is the better solution. And that I bet that many of the people who will come up with, "Oh, it's just Anicca," 'Oh, it's just all empty,' will probably not be able to apply that medicine often themselves. That a much, much better way of doing it, other than just stopping, is to divert. And so there's actually two different methods. But it's also kind of like a one-two punch. Yes, Amit, you've got a question.

**Speaker D:** Yes, I have a kind of a comment and also a question. So in— so this is, uh, I think in Advaita tradition, especially in the tradition of Maharishi Ramana Maharshi, so one of the solutions they provide is if you have a question, then you ask who is having the question. And so this inquiry method, and when I do it time to time and I realize actually usually is a hindrance, which hindrance of doubt, which is having a question. And I think this fits well in the divergent method.

**Speaker B:** Right. That's actually something that the Buddha has something to say about. And I know that this is quite common. It's actually something that Buddhists have borrowed from the Hindus. Asking questions like, well, who's asking the question? Bhikkhu Buddhadasa has the point of nothing is worth clinging to is I, me, or mine, so why should we ask about who is me, what is mine, etc., like that? That in fact, in Sutta 2 in the Majjhimanakaya, the Sabbha Asava Sutta, which means all of the taints, The very first one is talking about seeing things correctly. And that in the very first part of the sutta, the Buddha talks about that it's unwise attention to think about who am I, or what am I, or who is having this thought, or who it is. That a much better way or method is to see it as Dukkha, that our wise attention always comes back to the Four Noble Truths. In other words, instead of seeing my problem, we can see that's Dukkha, to have my problem. If I don't have my problem, then it's not my problem. And so, the much better thing to do is, for instance, Jesus, is to see that the thoughts that you're having that give rise to that question is actually causing you discomfort, is causing you dissatisfaction. So, what kind of thoughts can we change that to, to be satisfied? And that the easy ones that I have come up with over a long period of time is to keep telling yourself by gladdening the mind and mentioning that, "Oh, it's not that much of a big deal," or "I can handle that," or "Nothing to do, no place to go, everything is all right." In other words, we're diverting ourselves away from from the problem and seeing the problem as a problem. And like Amit is talking about, is seeing the problem as my problem, rather than seeing that it's not really a problem. Now that's what they're saying when they tell you everything is Anicca, everything is empty, is actually pointing at whatever it was that you were giving meaning to was a delusion on your part, that you were deluded by thinking that it was important, that it was a problem, that it had meaning, and in fact it probably doesn't. And that we all make ourselves miserable and happy because we put meaning to things. We think that we can read the future, we think that we can see where things are going, And we can a little bit. We're pretty good at seeing things in reality that are about to happen. Like, you can see that you're about to drive your car off the road. You can straighten it out and put it back into the lane. So we can see things that's dangerous. But mostly that's a real situation in real reality. Most of the problems that we have is when we see things delusionally in the mind. We think that, "Oh, it's going to go wrong, oh, it's going to go bad." I mean, nowadays the news is absolutely filled with how bad things are going to get in the future. Everybody's getting really terrified. I mean, look how many things we've got to be terrified about. We've got global warming, We've got AI, we've got Donald Trump, we've got Putin, we've got Hamas. Oh, we've got so many troubles, right? And the reason that all of those troubles exist is because people give that stuff meaning. And so If they're the ones who see the meaning in it, let them go deal with the global warming. If they see meaning, let them go deal with Putin. Let them go see about Hamas. Let somebody else who has the meaning stepped into it. But if we can bring ourselves around to the actual reality that things really don't mean that much, we really don't know what's going to happen in the future, then we can recognize that, oh, it's not my business, really. I mean, look how many people fret over global warming, and not one of them can do much of anything about it. Not one person. Then in fact, the joke is that people will get on an airplane and fly from California to Washington so that they can have a march, And when they finish marching on global warming, they get back on the airplane and fly back to California, and look how much they added to the global warming by loading up airplanes full of people who were against the airplanes making damage to the environment. So in a way, we do things backwards; we make more problems. Than we solve. Yes, Daniel, you got a question.

**Speaker C:** So for these kind of problems, like most problems like global warming, we have very little impact on. But there are small things that are like really low effort, like for example voting, that has a relatively big impact Or for example, cutting sugar out of your diet, and yeah, you can have a real impact on your own health. So for me, it's sometimes hard to.

**Speaker B:** See.

**Speaker C:** When I am using like wise wanting, or I'm just yeah, or I'm creating Dukkha for myself. Like, how do you know, like, what is wise wanting and what is not?

**Speaker B:** Ah, that always comes back to the whole point. Let's put it in two different topics. One is the middle path. Everything is middle path. To come out of the extremes. Any time that we're at an extreme, that's more than likely Dukkha. So, if we can find ourselves a balance in the middle, then that's the safer place to avoid Dukkha. The next part of that is that that requires investigation, sometimes a lot of investigation. To really look at what's going on so that we can determine the easy way out. And the easy way out is balance, the middle path. That often I speak in a way to get people out of one extreme, and they will hear me as if I'm coming from the opposite extreme. And actually, that's quite obvious in reality, that if you were way over to the left and you're looking over to the right, the biggest thing you see is something in the middle, because it's closer to you. But because you're looking over at the left and you're at the right, that means that whoever's in the middle is part of the problem. They're part of the other extreme. They're on the other side. Which leads me to the old Southern joke that one guy was kind of sitting on the fence, he didn't know which side of the Civil War that he wanted to be in, and so he put on a gray coat and blue pants. But then that means that the Yankees would shoot him in the chest, and the Rebs would shoot him in the butt. That kind of middle path doesn't work too well. Because people will see it as the exact opposite. And so it's good that we can talk about it in the sense of, once we begin to get really investigating, we can begin to find where is the sweet spot, where is the middle path, where is the Goldilocks position, rather than going for too hot and too cold, too soft or too hard. There's always a middle path, a middle place to go. And so even if somebody was giving you the information of everything is Anicca, everything is empty, that sounds like that it doesn't solve the problem because it's out there at the other extreme, to where in fact absolutely nothing matters. There is no place to go. Ever. But in fact, the way that we're practicing is not that there's no place to go ever. In fact, I had one guy, a good friend of mine, Robert, he brought his uncle on, and when I started to describe this to his uncle, he says, well, what you're saying is for me to stay in bed all the time, but I never get up. And my answer to that is, yeah, but you're going to have some brown sheets to play with. That you do have to get up sometimes, you do have to go, you have to take kind of a middle path someplace, that we can't go to the extreme of the other side just because we want to get away from one extreme to get to the other. And how we're practicing then this is to come to the point of not trying to make the mind stop completely, but to be able to give it really good guidance, to be able to steer our own lives, to get it into harmony. I like to use music a lot, because here's the point. Noise. Noise is just frequencies all over the place, that there— that is highs and it's lows and it's mixed together and there's no sense out of it. But if we can learn to get our mind into harmony, or get it into getting in tune, that means that we can play one note for a while, then we can change it to another note for a while. That if we get stuck on one note, Johnny One Note is probably just as miserable as absolute noise, everything all over the place. All right. So what we need then is to find a way of getting in harmony with what's going on around us. Another example would that be, would be scatterbrained. The mind's just all over the place. Any bright bauble or any bright object we see, we go right for it. They call— they actually have medical diagnosis for that, ADHD and all kinds of stuff, can't keep any attention. But the extreme at the other end of that would be the extreme of meditators who were getting too focused on some meditation object, and they're so focused on that meditation object that the house falls down around them. And they're not even paying attention to all the noise that's happening. And so maybe we need to find a middle path to be able to focus on something and then change our focus to something else so that we can move around. So instead of being scattered like this, we can go this and this and this and this to where the extreme for this The other extreme would be, and don't waver, don't move, stay there. All right, this is what happens when people don't know anything and they're all scattered, and then they'll learn one thing and they think that that's the only truth. I see that very much with people who are religious, especially in the United States, that they'll get focused on something and then they won't let it go. There's a whole lot of stuff that needs to be done, but if we're completely scatterbrained, we're not going to get anything done. And if we're too focused on one item, then we're leaving everything else abandoned. The example that I'm thinking about is the abortion issue. There is no reason to stay too focused on the abortion issue. There's a lot of other issues. That need to also be addressed if you're thinking about it from the ordinary mind state. That what we're really practicing then is to be able to find something that's worth paying attention to and pay attention to that, but then when something else is worth paying attention to, we can pay attention to that too and move from one thing to another. And become more effective. Now, one of the ways that we can talk about that is somebody has a job, and just like most people, they don't like that job. And so while they're doing the job, they go back and forth between doing the job and hating the job, and doing the job and hating the job, making the job very noisy. And that the way that we're practicing here is to get the mind straightened out so that we can be happy comfortable, secure, and then we can take that happiness, that comfort, and that security back to that job, so that we can do that job happily. And then when we get discomfort and unsatisfied with that job, we can leave it and go away and rest, get the mind back into shape, and then come back and do the job again. But most people are saying that they're so intent on getting that job done so that they can get some relief and pleasure over the job done, whether it's a well-done job or not. They just want to get it over with. And because of that, they're not being satisfied and happy and comfortable while they're doing the job. And after they finish the job, they're still not happy and comfortable. So what we need to do is to come out of our discomfort, our dissatisfactions, work with that first to divert away from all of the problems of the world. Because after all, Jesus, those problems are only your mental conditioning. Other than that, they're empty. And so when you have problems, recognize that you're making it up. The reality is, is that the planet Earth is just fine, probably even better off without humans. Humans are putting quite a skin rash on the planet Earth. Why? Because we want to solve all of these problems. I mean, we had a real problem with communication. Somebody's more than 100 yards away, I can't yell at him. And so now we have radio, but Morse code on old sparky radios was not enough, and we wind up having cell phones. But in the process of doing that, we're destroying the planet. We're making even bigger holes trying to dig up the minerals to do electronic stuff rather than the holes that we were drilling to dig up the oil so that we could transport. So, humans are actually more destructive than they are productive, that they do more damage than they do good, but they do all of the damage in the name of progress, doing good. And things don't last. We don't know what's going to happen with global warming, but one of the things that I know that the Buddha would do, is that if the sea level rises, he's going to grab his bowl and his robe and he's going to take a hike to higher ground. And that's all there is to it. But a lot of people, they don't want to go to higher ground. People don't want to leave Miami while it's flooding. They want to stay where they are and fix the problem. And the answer to that is a lot of problems we can't fix because humanity, in fact, made these problems. When they were trying to solve some other problem. So what is going to happen? Maybe they get Miami as under sea level, but they've got all of this and that, and, you know, building these high-rises and whatever like that to get away from the water. But then the high-rises will fall over because they don't have a good foundation. And in fact, that's a big problem now, I hear, in Florida, is that a lot of the high-rises that were built 15 and 20 years ago are just falling over now. Because they've lost their ability to withstand the changes of the world. So here's the whole point then: the world is going to continue to change. The planet Earth is responding to what's going on, and rather than us trying to fix whatever we see broken, the better thing to do is to take that middle path. And allow things to be just as they are. Because the real problem is not global warming. The real problem is not AI. The real problem is not Donald Trump or Putin or Biden or whoever we want to name. Hamas, Israel. We can always find something out there to blame for why we feel bad. Rather than looking at the actual problem of, "I feel bad because I'm thinking about things being bad. Why cannot I divert my mind to start thinking about things actually being okay?" Because right now, global warming is not bothering you and you still feel bad about it? What's going to happen when it really does happen? You're going to really feel bad then, because you don't have your mind together. So let's get our minds together, let's get it organized and unified, let's be able to stay focused a little bit, so that we can focus on the fact that right now, there is no problem. Right now, we've got no problem. So let's divert our mind away from all the problems we've got, and come to that point, somewhere in the middle, that, "Oh, we'll take care of it later. Right now, I'm going to get my mind straightened out, and when I get my mind straightened out, when I get my mind happy, comfortable, satisfied, then I might be able to solve that issue more productively." I can imagine that if the news in America, all of the cable and the broadcast and the internet and all this, started having happy communications, happy thoughts, then the people wouldn't be so dissatisfied. But they listen to all the problems of the world, and then they start to feel bad, rather than fixing the problems of the world. So, everything comes back to this one step, or one-two, One punch, two steps. One, let's get the mind together, get organized, get the mind functioning so that the heart is right, and then we can be more productive. So, Jesus, do you have any questions about this?

**Speaker A:** ... No, it was interesting about focusing on one issue, because this is something I do a lot. Focusing on one issue and forget about everything else, this happens to me. But I think it's clear for me. Clear for me. Yeah, I intellectually understand sometimes when my mind is.

**Speaker C:** Not.

**Speaker A:** Fit. The example would be when I was in fear, when I was in the— after the crypt. I was in fear that I was feeling all this pain in the chest and I went to someone, it's like, "This is happening to me." It's like, "Everything is in your mind." "Okay, well, this is not helping. I know everything is in my mind, but this is not helping." And then I remember you saying something really skillful. I don't remember exactly, but you say something really skillful. I started laughing and I was like, wow, this is helping. I mean, I know that everything is Anicca, but this, this is the kind of thing. And sometimes I feel like people is too less, very, very little sweet. They give you like this, like the teachings, like flexing the Dhamma to you, like, ah, everything is Anicca. And sometimes it's For me, it can be heavy, but you know, it's not. I know it's true, everything is empty in Anicca, but the way you say it to me was like, yes, this is what I needed. Everything was gone in 5.

**Speaker B:** Minutes. Yes, I think maybe what it was, because there were several things that I had to say, but the one that I enjoyed the most really laughing at was that Why are people afraid of ghosts? Ghosts haven't killed anybody for centuries, but automobiles and guns— I mean, why don't people become really afraid of automobiles? Why don't they become really afraid of guns and get rid of them? Throw them all out, you know, bury them in the same grave that we're burying the ghost in. I don't know, but in fact, Yeah, what are we afraid.

**Speaker A:** Of? I don't know what it was, but my body was shaking. It's like, I don't know what's going on.

**Speaker B:** Here. Yeah. All right, well, we were trained to be afraid of that kind of stuff when we were really young. That, in fact, I remember when I was 10 years old, we moved out of Charlotte, North Carolina, which in those days was actually a pretty dangerous There was already a huge amount of racial tension. This was in like 1955 or whatever like that. I remember some of the stuff going on. And then we moved to the little town of Fort Mill, South Carolina, but the house that we moved into was only a half a block away from the town cemetery. And here I have thoughts of, now I've moved into real danger. Instead of being afraid of all the live people, I'm afraid now of the spooks. And so my dad took me to the cemetery and walked around, and he showed me that some of these people have been in that ground as old old. The stones that they had to commemorate are falling over. Nothing much is there. In fact, the graveyard is empty. What is it empty of? Violent people. There's nobody in the cemetery that are violent, because everybody's afraid of the cemetery, and so they don't go there for camping. Then in fact, that's probably the best camping site you'll have. Even the cops go to the cemetery to roust you out because they're afraid of the ghosts. Now, I don't know why that's true, but our culture has gotten that somehow we're supposed to be afraid of the dead, where in fact the dead are the safest people we know. But that takes a little bit of wisdom. That takes my dad taking me to the cemetery and walking around and showing me that in fact this place is not dangerous. So what you need to do now is start walking around your own mind to see that the dangers that you are experiencing, you're making that stuff up. That the reality is, is that the graveyard is empty. The reality is, is that things have changed. All those people that were there that could hurt you, or they're dead now. And they can't hurt you. So why are we so afraid of things? We're not looking at where the real dangers are, that we're too focused on the wrong thing. And so the advice that this guy, whoever it was, gave you, that everything is Anicca, everything is empty, is absolutely good advice. He just didn't give you the directions of how to apply that, that you're not supposed to swallow that, you're supposed to rub it in. So, Kath, you've got a question. How's your rainstorm.

**Speaker A:** Now?

**Speaker B:** Thank.

**Speaker E:** You. Actually, uh, I don't know, can you hear.

**Speaker B:** Me? Yes, I.

**Speaker E:** Can. Yeah, the rain is really hitting hard on this tin.

**Speaker B:** Roof. Tell me about it. I'm a yard full of.

**Speaker E:** It. I was remembering what you're saying about the middle path between doing something when the world has problems. And that's actually what got me into meditation.

**Speaker B:** Pretty.

**Speaker E:** Much. I really wanted to do something, have some positive impact. So I joined this humanitarian kind of group or charity money-raising group or something like that in Germany. And when I went there, I would say it was a very intense kind of place, very much focused on the mission. So I never was in it. Yeah, I was never in an environment like that. So after like a month, my mind was just totally tangled up and like could not handle that place. And that's pretty much what got me into meditation because I tried to make this change. I had like this extreme intention, but my mind was not ready for that. And I couldn't really do what I wanted to do. So it's very true, like, uh, that getting your mind straight now is the way to do it, you know. And, and I think that you can have a good, good, uh, action or whatever you want to do if you want to do.

**Speaker B:** Something. Very true. That in fact, uh, that's a good example. Those, um, NGOs, those places that are just, um, uh, the whole, like Red Cross or maybe, um, some rescue organization, or maybe they're raising children for the Children's Fund or something like that. All of the people who volunteer for those places have that attitude of, "Oh, we've got to do something," because they all, each one, feel miserable inside, and so they want to go fix that over there, so that they'll feel good right here. So, what you're doing when you walk into an NGO like that, is you're walking into a snake pit. All of those people are 'pradyakats' and they'll bite anything to try to preserve themselves. So, in a way, like I was saying, the Wat is very much like a mental hospital. Those NGOs are very much like a mental hospital. Those people there are sick. And they're making the big mistake that they'll all feel better if they can all work together to get some job done, to get some blood delivered or some money delivered or whatever their mission is, and they wind up eating each other alive. And nobody can handle it. All right, there's a lot of professions that are like that. Social workers are a really good example. Nurses are another good example, that people want to dedicate their lives to doing good And they don't last long. Why is it? Because they have what, in fact, they've got a term for it, the term is "burnout." That the social worker sees how many divorced women with children that she gives good advice to, and they don't take it, and they wind up being miserable, whether they've got a social worker on their side or not. And the social workers, that gets to them. And they recognize that they're not really helping anybody anyway. The medicine they give, the people are not taking it properly. And so they get burned out. Nurses get burned out. They don't like it when they are working on that old lady and saying, oh, you're going to be all right, let me give you a massage, or let me give you this medicine. And then the old lady croaks, and the nurse doesn't like that at all. And when she starts having people die left, right, and center, she says, man, I don't want to be a nurse. I came here here to help people, and everybody dies. So, I'm glad that you left that place. And as far as staying at the wat, be sure that there are nobles at that wat and you associate with the nobles. Go spend your time with the doctors, not with the patients. So Daniel, I think you were.

**Speaker C:** Next. Yeah, so when you talk about the middle path, I get the idea that it's always about having just enough of everything to.

**Speaker B:** Get.

**Speaker C:** Along. But some people And yeah, me, I would argue that some things can be optimized really easily. So would it then be like wise wanting, for example, what we talked about yesterday, to cut out sugar from your diet? Or for example, I am doing physiotherapy each day, which I don't necessarily enjoy, but it really helps me stay comfortable during the day when I have to do sweeping, for example, because I have like an old shoulder injury and it helps me with sitting on the floor. So on the one hand, yeah, if I wanted to, I could use my other arm or I could find ways to sit. But yeah, just really, I feel like it really helps me and it's like a really low effort thing to do, like the same way cutting out the sugar. So yeah, I'm just really confused.

**Speaker B:** About— well, I'm not really against physical therapy. In fact, physical therapy, when well applied, is valuable. Now, I wouldn't suggest that you take the physical therapy all the way to Anagami or Arnold Schwarzenegger, you know, muscle-bound and whatnot like that. There's there's always a middle path. And that in Thailand, in fact, Thailand, one of the things that they're internationally famous for is massage, physical therapy. And since you're in Thailand, you call it physical therapy, but it's probably just a.

**Speaker C:** Thai massage. Oh no, like actual, like exercises for like my shoulder and for my, yeah, for my lower.

**Speaker B:** Body. Oh, I see. So you're doing this yourself? Yeah. Okay, well, there's no problem with that. The question is, is that when you're actually doing it, can you enjoy it? That— see, what you're saying is, is that you're doing those things and not liking it, hoping that it'll improve in the future. The question is, when you're doing those exercises, can you have the thoughts right then and there is, "Oh, this is helping. Right now I feel better. Right now this is working. Right now I can get rid of that pain. Right now I can handle things." This is the major point about the teaching of the Buddha, is that it is not doing X in order to get Y. We do Y and forget all about.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points:

**Core Issue Discussed:** A student (Speaker A/Jesus) expresses frustration with receiving overly simplistic, doctrinal advice like "Everything is *anicca* (impermanent)" or "Everything is empty" when sharing personal problems or fears. He finds this unhelpful and wonders if it's a form of spiritual bypassing.

**Dhammarato's (Speaker B) Main Teachings in Response:**

1.  **The Advice is "Excellent but Useless":** Statements about impermanence and emptiness are profound truths, but they are like a doctor's prescription given without instructions. They are ineffective as one-time, abstract statements to someone in distress.

2.  **Two Methods of Practice:** He contrasts the two approaches:
    *   **Abandoning:** This is the "not me, not mine" approach, directly dismissing phenomena as empty or impermanent. This is advanced and difficult for a beginner, like trying to stop a massive ship. The unskillful use of "everything is *anicca*" falls here.
    *   **Diverting (The Recommended Beginner's Method):** This is "gladdening the mind" or "changing the channel." Instead of trying to stop negative thoughts, one skillfully steers the mind toward wholesome, comforting, or balanced thoughts. This is the practical, applicable skill needed to handle distress.

3.  **The "Hospital" or "Snake Pit" Analogy:** Spiritual communities (Wats) and humanitarian organizations are likened to mental hospitals or snake pits—full of people who are themselves suffering ("mentally ill" or "snakes"). Taking advice from fellow seekers without discernment is like asking patients in a waiting room for a diagnosis instead of seeing the doctor.

4.  **The Practical Path - Gladdening & Diversion:** The core practice for dealing with distress is not to philosophize but to:
    *   **Gladden the mind:** Use calming, reassuring phrases like "It's not a big deal," "I can handle this," or "Right now, everything is okay."
    *   **Investigate and Diversify:** Look at the specific component of the problem (the "flat tire" on the chariot) rather than getting overwhelmed by the whole. Learn to focus the mind skillfully and then shift focus as needed, avoiding both scatterbrained anxiety and rigid fixation on a single issue.

5.  **Connection to the Middle Path:** The solution lies in finding balance—the Middle Path. This means avoiding extremes: neither being consumed by the world's problems (like global warming, politics) nor retreating into a nihilistic "nothing matters." The wise approach is to first cultivate a calm, happy, and unified mind; from that stable foundation, one can act more effectively in the world if needed.

6.  **The Real Problem is Mental Conditioning:** Ultimately, our suffering arises from the meaning *we* assign to events. The world's problems feel overwhelming because we think about them in a way that causes distress. The solution is to change that internal relationship through diversion and gladdening, recognizing that much of our fear is a conditioned "ghost" we've learned to believe in.

**Conclusion:** The talk emphasizes moving beyond reciting doctrine as a band-aid and instead cultivating the practical, moment-to-moment skill of steering the mind away from distress and toward contentment as the essential first step on the path.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Speaker B) uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate their points about spiritual advice, practice, and the Middle Path. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Key Metaphors and Stories**

1. **The Doctor and Medicine Metaphor**
   - **Scenario**: People go to a doctor who prescribes pills. If taken as directed, they might help, but often the diagnosis is rushed or the medicine isn’t taken properly.
   - **Purpose**: To critique shallow spiritual advice (e.g., “everything is Anicca/empty”) as “excellent but useless” if not applied correctly—like a prescription without instructions.

2. **The Wat as a Mental Hospital**
   - **Scenario**: A wat (temple) is compared to a hospital where everyone is “mentally ill.” Asking for advice there is like asking fellow patients instead of the doctor.
   - **Purpose**: To warn that many at a wat are seekers themselves, not qualified teachers, and may give well-meaning but unskillful advice.

3. **The Chariot/Automobile and Emptiness**
   - **Story**: References Nagarjuna’s analogy with King Milinda: a chariot has no inherent “chariot-ness”; it’s just parts assembled. Similarly, a car disassembled into parts loses its “car-ness.”
   - **Purpose**: To explain *anatta* (no-self) and emptiness—things have no inherent essence, only conventional reality.

4. **The Big Ship (Aircraft Carrier) Without Brakes**
   - **Metaphor**: The beginner’s mind is like a massive ship that can’t stop quickly but **can be steered**.
   - **Purpose**: To advocate for *diversion* (changing thoughts) rather than trying to immediately *stop* or *empty* the mind.

5. **The Southern Civil War Joke**
   - **Story**: A man tries to stay neutral by wearing a gray coat (Confederate) and blue pants (Union), so both sides shoot him.
   - **Purpose**: To humorously illustrate that a poorly understood “middle path” can fail if it’s just mixing extremes without wisdom.

6. **Music and Harmony vs. Noise**
   - **Metaphor**: An untrained mind is like noise—random frequencies. A trained mind is like harmonious music, able to play one note then another skillfully.
   - **Purpose**: To describe mental balance—neither scattered (noise) nor rigidly fixated (one note).

7. **The Graveyard is Empty**
   - **Personal Story**: As a child, the speaker feared a cemetery until his father showed him it was just empty ground; the dead aren’t dangerous.
   - **Purpose**: To show that fears are often mental projections, not reality. “The graveyard is empty” means dangers are often illusions.

8. **NGOs / Charities as a “Snake Pit”**
   - **Metaphor**: Humanitarian groups are filled with people trying to fix external problems to feel better inside, leading to burnout and conflict.
   - **Purpose**: To emphasize that inner peace must come before effective outer action.

9. **Global Warming and Airplane Protesters**
   - **Anecdote**: Protesters fly on planes to march against climate change, ironically contributing to the problem.
   - **Purpose**: To illustrate how well-intentioned actions can be counterproductive without self-awareness and inner change.

10. **Johnny One Note**
    - **Metaphor**: Someone stuck on one note in music is as miserable as someone with a scattered, noisy mind.
    - **Purpose**: To warn against extreme fixation (over-focus) as another form of imbalance.

### **Themes in the Metaphors**
- **Medicine & Application**: Spiritual advice must be correctly applied, not just given.
- **Emptiness & Illusion**: Things lack inherent essence; problems are often mental constructions.
- **Balance & Middle Path**: Avoid extremes of distraction vs. fixation, action vs. passivity.
- **Inner Work Before Outer Action**: Cultivate a gladdened mind first, then engage with the world skillfully.

These metaphors and stories make abstract Buddhist concepts (like *anatta*, *anicca*, *middle path*) relatable and warn against using them as bypassing or unskillful advice.
