### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Oh good, just chilling, just chillaxing. It's snowy where I'm at, so we're just relaxing, staying inside.

**Speaker B:** It's raining here as well. It's been raining for 2 days straight. It's wonderful though, we needed it.

**Speaker A:** Nice. That's great, man. So how has your practice been?

**Speaker B:** It's been, um, just a second.

**Speaker A:** I'm actually gonna take your time.

**Speaker B:** Window, he comes and goes. Practice. The ardency to practice comes and goes, and we have to allow that.

**Speaker A:** What does ardency mean? I don't know that word.

**Speaker B:** Ardency is something I picked up from Ajahn Thanasaro, and it's— does it mean like urgency, or— I think it's— I wouldn't say urgency. I wouldn't say that. I would say zeal, because I would go with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa on that. I'd go with zeal and chanda.

**Speaker A:** Cool.

**Speaker B:** Because to me, they seem more like they're— they seem more in context. And I'm finding more and more the importance of relating contextually to others in the practice, and at least You're going to act in line with my intention to share.

**Speaker C:** Hi, hello, good to see you.

**Speaker A:** How's it going, dude?

**Speaker C:** Good, chill.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, is, uh, is anybody still doing— I, I read on Discord, is anybody still doing the I forget what we used to do. Was it— did you do a Wednesday call, DJ?

**Speaker C:** I did a Saturday night one call and then Brett filled in for a while, so I think that's the one you're referring to. But yeah, I decided to take a bit of a breather from that one for a little bit. So yeah, might return someday.

**Speaker A:** But somebody was saying like it's not like one of the days wasn't going up anymore, so I was just— yeah, yeah, so I never know what The hell is going on?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I thought you were doing it, DJ.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I was for a bit, but I decided, like, just where I was at, I was like, I just wanted to take a little bit of a break from the hosting. So yeah.

**Speaker A:** But yeah, I hear you.

**Speaker C:** But we have quite a few calls going, so I think.

**Speaker D:** But from the community.

**Speaker A:** Snow.

**Speaker D:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** My son's looking at the snow outside. Yeah, we're gonna go, we're gonna go outside in a little bit. We gotta let a few more inches fall so we actually have something.

**Speaker C:** Oh yeah, we got a little bit of snow here.

**Speaker A:** Oh, did you? Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Huh, Canada.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it was all ice actually yesterday because like the front of our driveway will be filled up by the plows, and it was like really frozen and icy, and I had to break it up with a metal shovel. But somebody actually came along, they were like, um, I think clearing out the apartments, and so they had like a, you know, a plow, and so they just plowed off like so I didn't have to do half of it. So that was a very nice kind act. So I was like, oh wow, that's fortunate.

**Speaker A:** So Yeah, nice. I'm gonna go outside in a little bit, buddy. Un poquito, little bit. So how's your practice going, DJ?

**Speaker C:** Oh, it's actually going quite swimmingly recently. It's, you know, it's It's fun.

**Speaker B:** Did you just say swimmingly?

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Sweet.

**Speaker B:** If it was soup, what kind of soup would it be?

**Speaker C:** What kind of soup would it be?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, if it was soup.

**Speaker C:** If it was soup?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** I don't know, the flavors are changing. Sometimes it's a little sour, sometimes it's savory.

**Speaker B:** Hot and sour.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker D:** Hot and sour.

**Speaker B:** It's like life.

**Speaker C:** Yep, it's quite dynamic. It's quite dynamic actually, um, the way that it is now. So, but, um, yeah, I've been doing that. I got getting out more too, helping out my dad. He does a little, uh, history show, local history show called Historical Niagara, and he just did a little like a presentation for— I think they're like the Arya cadets, but it's kind of like this like thing for like kids and what have you. So they like had him do that, and so I helped him out with that and like the projector, setting up the computer and all that stuff because his eyesight's not so great anymore. Like he's having a hard time, so I'm helping him out with that and carrying all the heavy stuff. And then also helping out my mom. She's got a little library So that's just like straight up, you know, just generosity right there. So we on Saturday picked up a bunch of books from someone who we see walking around our neighborhood, right? But he's normally reading a book. And so it was cool because he checks out the little library all the, you know, very frequently. And yeah, my mom went over with him and he had like 4 boxes of books that he just like gave away. So we're just, we cycle them out. We've got maybe I don't know, it can probably hold like, I'm not quite sure, like 40 books or something, maybe a little bit more than that, and then just rotate them out and, you know, people will take a book, leave a book. So yeah, it's cool.

**Speaker B:** Welcome, Paul.

**Speaker E:** Oh.

**Speaker C:** But yeah, how has the practice been there, Brett?

**Speaker B:** It's been strong.

**Speaker A:** Sorry, dude, my son here.

**Speaker B:** Oh, as a matter of fact.

**Speaker E:** Um.

**Speaker B:** We may do a Skype group tonight, so if you guys want to join— oh cool— so Michael, myself, Ivan, yeah, you guys want to join it. So it may be later, um, when Michael Messenger has time to, um, finish up his, um, all everything he has to do and get the kids tucked in and all that stuff. We're going to have something on Skype. So hopefully, yeah, I'll toss you guys an invite if you guys want.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, well, we'll see. Yeah, that's neat. I like seeing, yeah, Michael's stuff. Michael's into stuff.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I really appreciate too the gifts that you sent me, Brett.

**Speaker E:** You, though.

**Speaker C:** Even the letters, I use them as bookmarks so I kind of remember them. And I put that little keychain that you gave me, or that your— I think your wife got it, right? Stace, if you don't mind me saying.

**Speaker B:** I'm sorry, she was the one that found it. Yeah, I mean, I wanted something that we had talked about along those lines, and she found it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker C:** So that's cool. Yeah, put it on the— put it on the keys.

**Speaker D:** So.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, because yeah, well now I was out of a car for a bit, but now I'm pretty much the driver of the house, so I put it on that keychain for the household car. So yep, enjoying that a little. I know there was those wands that you gave me too, and you know, it's like a five-pointed star, but like it's fun using these things. Like again, not being super reliant on them, but as nice little reminders, you know, You know, because it's like, oh, we can remember all kinds of— because like the five faculties or the five powers, right? With just like, you know, a five-pointed star or something. I like to kind of do that.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so yeah, yeah.

**Speaker C:** That'S nice.

**Speaker A:** Hi, Paul Mott. Is that how you say it?

**Speaker E:** Yeah. I just thought I'll hang out for a bit. It's going well.

**Speaker A:** Oh, good. It's very good. So does anybody have any questions? About Dharma practice at all? You got a question, little guy? No questions?

**Speaker B:** Your reading, Dhamma, of Master of Self.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, yeah, still have more to do.

**Speaker B:** That's something that I felt like it was a benefit, and it's— oh yeah, it's almost like I'm put to grief to try and explain how. So maybe you could say some words about your experience with Vedanta?

**Speaker A:** Oh, there's nothing to it really. But that book particularly from Sri Siddharameshwar Maharaj is really nice. He was Nisargadatta's teacher. And basically their take on it is like the Self is the Atman, or the true self they call it, and the ego is kind of like the false self. And it's really not much different from what we practice, what we might call Anatta, or sometimes even like Sukkha, joy or peace. That's more in line with the pure self than an ego, a permanent self. Attachments to desires. So they use different wordings, but it's basically the same thing, like all religion, if it's done in earnest, like Ramakrishna said.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and that was mentioned in the book. So, but you say then that such an abidance is the natural state, or is it a fabricated state?

**Speaker A:** I don't know. I think if you're satisfied, I think questions like that don't really matter.

**Speaker D:** You know.

**Speaker A:** I think if you're satisfied, up and down, black and white, right or wrong answers questions, they serve their purpose in normal day-to-day activity, but ultimately I think are kind of not important to me personally, but I don't know, they may be important to somebody else that may get more value from questions and stuff like that. But I just look at it as simplicity. Like, if you're satisfied, then there's nothing really to— nothing else to achieve or attain, really, if you can be content with the way things are, not the way we want them to be, you know. So yeah.

**Speaker B:** So those, the extensive 5 steps in the book then are a way of arriving where we are. So then they're a way of, if necessary, removing obscurations to what we've got that you—.

**Speaker A:** I think in a way that book particularly is putting in so many words the importance of silence. But not just silence of the mind and voice, but silence of the heart. Like everybody, like Shakespeare, he writes volumes of plays on love. In the Vedanta or different branches of it, they just write a whole bunch of series on simplicity of silence, but they express it in many different ways. At least that's my take on it. I don't know, I could be wrong.

**Speaker B:** Interesting. You asked me about practice, and yesterday there was a decision to spend a few hours on practice. And of course, what happened was not that. What happened was getting distracted in speech in the Skype list. So on returning to practice, It was about the third hour of where practice would have been taking place, and here I'm calling practice Anapanasati this time, breath meditation. But the third hour, I put on— it just so happened I put on a Sri Ramana video about silence, and with actual auditory oral segments of silence in the.

**Speaker D:** Talk.

**Speaker B:** And it wasn't until that talk was in the background that the mind was in what I would call Samadhi, or the hindrances had fallen away. It was noticed, but there was no worry of going to sleep and No problems. But Sri Ramana mentions in this talk from Viveka Hermannage Seminary, Jaisara, she mentions that silence is the ground for speech and sound itself. So it doesn't mean we can't talk.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there's no— there's no— in my opinion, there's no can or can'ts or shoulds or shouldn'ts. Things are as they are, and it's our natural— a lot of the time it's our natural instinct to adhere to things too tightly. And force others to do the same. But it's a learning process sometimes. It's a growing process. We all make mistakes. We all say, do, act inappropriately sometimes, or say the wrong things, or wish we said things better than we did. But that's just being a human. It's just living a life. There's no problems. It's like what Alan Watts would say about the trees. They don't have to grow perfectly straight in the forest. Some are sick, some are old, some die, some zag this way and zig that way.

**Speaker B:** This way.

**Speaker A:** But that's the beauty of nature is that there's nobody putting a gun to our heads saying we have to do this, have to do that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Must believe this. Everything is a guideline. And that's why a lot of people have problems with letting things go, you know, because our Eastern— I'm sorry, Western mindset is more about the sit down, do what you're told, get a good grade, run the race, climb the mountain mentality. And I think with a lot of beginners too, there's always a feeling, or at least there was for me at the beginning of spiritual practice or whatever you want to call it, Dharma practice, that we have to get somewhere where we're not. And when Dhammarato would say like things like good enough is okay, all the Buddhist teaching could be summed up in don't worry, be happy, It's very freeing as a spiritual practitioner of many years to be like, oh, I don't need to become something or evolve into something. Things are as they are right here, right now, and that's good enough. That's perfect, you know. And conversations and activities and things in our environment will take their natural course of leading us this way, but it's all kind of just flowing. It's not really all that important, important enough to stress about anyway. Some things maybe, and that's okay, but on the most part it's just relaxing and breathing.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's funny, I was hanging out too like yesterday going to that. I was just thinking about what you were talking to, it came to mind about like the whole technique thing and stuff. But I remember the Mr. Rogers movie I'm trying to remember what exactly it was, like something like in the neighborhood, right? But he practiced, he kind of like prays for people where he just chants their name over and over again. Like that's what it kind of shows, just going with somebody's name over and over again. So that's kind of a fun thing to remember people's names, like when you're first meeting people and stuff. And it's also like some meta to like just have those wholesome thoughts, like you're just like cheering for them, like yeah, we can do this. You know what I mean? It really helped. Like, I don't know, it really helped with like, so because like at that event yesterday, like socializing, right? But it wasn't like a hardcore like effort thing. It was just like a nice little practice, you know?

**Speaker B:** So yeah, the event where the book with the books.

**Speaker C:** Oh no, actually, I'm going to the thing with my father for his history show. So just like, yeah, yeah, like just meeting people and stuff. Yeah.

**Speaker E:** Cool.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, my father was a history teacher, actually, in high school. Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that's an interesting thing to know. Yeah, my dad doesn't— he goes out there, he doesn't have like any kind of like, you know, certification or anything like that, right? He just started this page, he teaches it, but But people just, they love it. So he's got lots of followers and stuff. But you know, but I mean, the thing is, is like, you know, it's just like the kids, they were so enthused with like seeing all the old, you know, stuff. And he would tell them the history of it, right? Like one of the cool things here was, you know, the indigenous people, they like, there's like, they have these like cultivators, like these stones, right? And for cult— I really gravitated towards that because, and just handling it, like, and because he found a whole bunch of, um, well, he was gifted it and, you know, given the go-ahead, but just to cultivate like the earth, right? And it's just like this stone. I'm like, oh wow, that's so beautiful because it comes back to Dharma. It's like cultivating the mind, right? So yeah, but yeah, no, so it was really cool, um, but just to see the enthusiasm and yeah, yeah, I think I remember Dhammarato talking about like, you know, that's actually a pretty wholesome thing to do is to go back like and actually just like like go with the facts and like the history stuff. And that can be a wholesome thing to do in that way. Like, yeah, we can probably practice coming back here and stuff, but it doesn't mean that we can never ever think about the past in the practical sense or about that, you know. And all of it's happening now in a sense, right? But I think it's all coming when we recognize it more and more from this place of silence, right? So beyond, beyond gone, gone, gone beyond, gone completely beyond awakening. Amen.

**Speaker B:** Go beyond. Go far beyond God. Be founded in enlightenment.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** Hi. Could you maybe talk a little bit more about the silence of the mind and the heart. What do you mean by the heart? The feelings, the Vedana? Citta.

**Speaker A:** Who are you asking, Paul Metta? Hi Michael.

**Speaker D:** Hello.

**Speaker E:** Hi Michael.

**Speaker B:** Hey Michael.

**Speaker E:** I was just pondering about silence. So in general observation, it almost feels, okay, it goes, the mind goes silent, but the body seems to find it uncomfortable, like being in a silent state. I don't mean word. And it almost wants to go back into the head, into the thoughts. So is it something I guess takes a bit more skill development to be comfortable being in the silence?

**Speaker A:** Well, just silence in the normal way of expressing it. It's like everything else, like sitting meditation, for example. It just takes a little practice. And just like when you were a kid, you learned to walk, it wasn't really comfortable. Or you learned to ride your bike, it wasn't comfortable at first, but you get used to it. It's nothing crazy. It's skillful, but there's nothing crazy. But Silence I was talking about is more like silence of—.

**Speaker C:** It'S more like.

**Speaker A:** An equanimity of the mind, like a joyful, peaceful kind of.

**Speaker B:** State.

**Speaker A:** And not necessarily the brain. The brain's always going to be a chaotic mess, but I feel like with practice, when I say mind, it's really our true peaceful nature. Apart from the mind. It's a bit of the mind, but it's ultimately apart from the mind because we can't calm the brain. There's nothing you could do to calm the brain. It's going to do whatever it wants. We're not in control entirely of the brain. A little bit we can, but ultimately, if we distance ourselves from associating so deeply with it and take refuge in the breathing and Anapanasati then whatever's going on in the mind, the periods of chaos will pass. And then we can become one with the mind again, so to speak, and everything's fine. And then when it turns into a big chaotic mess, it causes us Dukkha, then we come back to the breathing. And that's why I think the Buddha emphasized impermanence so much. I don't think it's— yeah, the laws of reality seem to reflect that. And thermodynamics seem to reflect that as well. But I think the Buddha emphasized it because as we're coming home to our breath, the Three Jewels—the Buddha, the Sangha, the Dharma—it gives the brain a chance to just pass away like the cause and effect, the negative stuff. And then once that passes, we come back to it. That's the silence I'm kind of referring to, not so much audible. But if anybody else has different takes on that, feel free to express them.

**Speaker B:** It's the same take.

**Speaker D:** There's a key.

**Speaker B:** One key is, I would like to invite everyone to consider, and for many of you it's very familiar, Often, all too often, in survival's attempt to get its hooks, keep its hooks in us, there's a fear of non-existence that will arise if we stop talking. It's just a bluff, let us say, of Mara. So as Dhamma reminds us, Anicca will fix it. Inconstancy, change. The ground has changed. It's already changed. So the silence that— there was a poem by Emily Dickinson, if I can remember. I think it was at the beginning of The Nectar of Immortality by Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj. But it was The infinite, a sudden guest, has been assumed to be, or like a bolt of lightning, the infinite, a sudden guest, is assumed to be. But how could that stupendous come which never went away? So the silence then that we would draw our attention to is.

**Speaker A:** There.

**Speaker B:** From beginningless time. It's like, it may be like a space-like awareness that is revealed.

**Speaker A:** That's cool, man.

**Speaker C:** That's what I was gonna say. That's pretty cool. This is pretty cool.

**Speaker A:** Emily Dickinson is sweet.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I heard of "Fly Buzz When I Died." It's one of her best poems.

**Speaker A:** Oh, nice. I don't know any by heart, but I have a book that I casually browse through, and it's very lovely.

**Speaker B:** I have a VC that I promised, so I have to take off. Thank you, friends.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, thank you.

**Speaker B:** It's good seeing you, friends. Thank you so much.

**Speaker D:** It's good to see you.

**Speaker B:** Peace out, homie.

**Speaker D:** Bye-bye. Peace. Bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, the silence and stuff, it could be confusing and stuff, but, uh, it's just basically a chaotic Dukkha-causing mind versus a joyful, light-hearted mind that is very peaceful and not causing any trouble outside, inside. That's why I like talking about Kamma. Kamma is so wonderful and a relevant and great subject to talk about because there really is a beauty to fully understanding Kamma. And when we're— it's like when Jesus forgives the sinners, the sinners can't believe that they're forgiven because they look at themselves as just trash, you know, thieves, trash, murderers. So Christ forgives them, they can't believe it. See, and he's teaching them the trick is you have to forgive yourself. And that's kind of like with Kamma. It's like every mind moment we're given yet another chance to do the right thing. We're given yet another chance of peace. And can we take that offering moment by moment? And if we don't take that offering, if we become wrapped up in our desires and angers and fears and even happinesses and all these things, sometimes a lot of Dukkha could come from that. And that's, in my opinion, that's what Kamma is, this action and the effects and causes within that action that later, for instance, if I get mad and I punch somebody, I might face legal trouble, I might feel guilty, all these things both physical and inside. So if I'm not causing Kamma, if I'm sitting peacefully in a room, it doesn't matter what the brain's doing. The brain could think the whole world's a pile of shit, but I'm not doing, I'm not creating any negative Kamma on the physical world anyway. And then I start looking at the inner and I say, oh, that's not of any use, that's just Anicca, Dukkha, Nanta. So then I have the understanding that I can't create bad Kamma as long as my physical actions aren't doing anything bad. And it becomes a balance of, oh, sitting down in silence, not taking anything too seriously, not grasping at things, not getting overly upset or overly wrapped up in things. I create no more negative Kamma. The opposite, actually. I'm creating beautiful things. More Sukkha. Turning our Dukkha into Sukkha. Like I always say, the holy alchemy. And it's not difficult because we just literally just need to sit or walk or do whatever we're doing and not be vicious, not be attached, not be poisoned. And everything happens automatically. You know, when we get it wrapped up in the illusion, things don't happen so automatically. Well, they happen automatically according to negative Kamma. But if we just breathe— Hi, fella. Yeah, as soon as the call's done, we're gonna go outside, okay? And we'll put your snow pants on. Yeah, is that a deal? Okay, deal. But yeah, that's my.

**Speaker C:** Two cents. It's good to see you again, Michael.

**Speaker D:** Good to see you too, DJ. I was looking at your painting behind you.

**Speaker C:** Oh yeah, I like it.

**Speaker D:** It looks like a snowy village.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, picked that up at a thrift store a while ago.

**Speaker D:** So yeah, I just assumed you did it.

**Speaker C:** Oh no, my dad does quite a few paintings actually though, but or he did, but not so much myself. Not yet anyway, but yeah.

**Speaker D:** There were two things that I was thinking about while looking at it. One is your cool Anapanasati videos that you make out in the woods by your house. And then two is this show that came on Apple TV called Disclaimer. I think it's called Disclaimer. No, not Disclaimer. I don't know, it's like a thriller.

**Speaker A:** With.

**Speaker D:** What's that comedian's name? I'm so bad at remembering names. I can't remember the name of the show or the comedian. But anyway, just to make a long story short, it's like a psychological thriller, and there's some kind of like emergence of consciousness between like— is it Billy Crystal? Billy Crystal, the kid, and some guy in his past life had some traumatic event on like a snowy lake, and his wife like while she was dying of cancer, she drew this really scary picture, and it's like in this snowy place with an old farmhouse and like some kids playing, and it's all, you know, the whole, the whole plot rotates around this image. Anyway, I was thinking that's what that looks like.

**Speaker C:** It looks like— yeah, was it called Convergence, or you said— or I think so.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I think it's Convergence. Yeah, have you seen it?

**Speaker C:** Oh no, I haven't. So maybe I will. I, I tend to— there's some shows that I watch with some friends, so That might be— I got like a group that I watch shows with. So yeah, yeah, I'll bring that up.

**Speaker D:** Not to get too far away from the topic of Dhamma. I had like maybe a thought or two about the topic of silence. And if you guys don't mind me sharing. And so yeah, it's interesting because Like, silence is such a, such like a, like a phenomenon that like most spiritual traditions find unity in, right? Like the Christian mystics talk about silence and unity with God, and the, the, all the different traditions, they kind of find unity in silence. And like the Buddhist description It's going to be hard to describe this. I'm going to see if I can do it. Like, you know how like the second jhana is called noble silence? And it's characterized by— the first jhana is characterized by the cessation of speech. And the second jhana is characterized by the cessation of thinking and pondering. And thinking and pondering is the condition for verbal speech. But all of the jhana practice in the suttas is started with to bring mindfulness, parimokkham, which means around the mouth. It's usually translated as to the fore, but actually means around the mouth. And that's actually important to understand because the Buddha calls this body we have the craving body. And most other like traditions of his time, they call it the food body, but the Buddha called it the craving body because the body that we actually experience is grown from craving and it starts at the mouth. So like from the moment we're born, you know, we're orally fixated. All of our delight comes from the mouth, from drinking milk, the toys we put in our mouth, every— all the objectification of the world is built from the mouth. And we, we, we form our mental concepts of objects from putting everything in our mouth. And all of our pleasure and delight and our attachments are centered around the mouth. And that continues throughout our whole life. So And so all of our delight and all of our sense of control and ownership is all centered around the mouth. Our entire craving body is grown from this center. And so when we, you know, I'm not gonna go through all the preconditions, but we get to the point where there's the cessation of speech, verbal speech that brings you into first Jhana. That's like the first moment where like the mind breaks away from the craving body. Which is the sort of the representation of the body that we identify as ourselves. And then after the cessation of speech, then there's a cessation of thinking and pondering. There's a further divorce between the mind and the craving-born body. And that's what the Buddha calls silence. Silence in Buddhism is not so much an absence of sound. It's like an experience of the cessation of ownership between the mind and the body. When Ajahn Chah talks about it, he talks about the oil and water separating out. That's that experience in Jhana where the mind and body are seen to exist in completely separate domains with no contact between the two of them. It all starts with breaking our—.

**Speaker B:** With.

**Speaker D:** Bringing the mouth to cessation, essentially watching our mouths, our speech, and our food, things like that. It's a really powerful practice. That's why monks eat one meal a day and they don't speak unless they have to, because that's what what they're looking to do. A lot of them don't know that's what they're doing, but that's what the Buddha is talking about.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, thank you, Michael. It's interesting too, bringing up that like to the fore, you know, actually means that around the mouth area. And that's like a good— like to be mindful of that, to bring awareness, you know, to remember to be aware of what's going on, right? And where the craving arises, right, from that.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, so that's, that's how you break that sakaya ditti, that identification, uh, with the body. Because that sakaya ditti, you know, sakaya, the, uh, sakaya is that craving body that we identify as ourselves. It's that, um, it's that perception of like a fixed— because the body that we experience is, is fixed in our mind, but it's, you know, it's not a static— in reality, it's not a static thing. It's a dynamic process. I like— I think I've told you guys Bhante Puññaji's joke before about that, that maybe is less relevant for this generation. But Dhamma Das, I think you're at least closer to my age, so maybe it'll ring true with you. But there was a time when, you know, somebody would bring a picture of you that they took, printed out photo of you that you took, and you weren't seeing images of yourself all the time. And you pick up the photo and you look at it and be like, that's not me, you know, because it doesn't match the mental image you have of yourself. Because the body that we're actually identified with isn't the actual physical body, it's the mental representation of the body that's craving-born in the mind. And like, yeah, part of the purpose of Jhana is to get a temporary glimpse at, you know, the Anicca, Dukkha, and not the nature of that thing that we identify as ourselves.

**Speaker C:** But yeah, so Sakkha, that's that craving body.

**Speaker D:** And then there was one other thing that I was going to bring up in regard to— is it Palmut or Palmut? Paul Matt? Paul Matt?

**Speaker A:** Did I say any of those right? Arnold Paul Matts?

**Speaker D:** Just Paul.

**Speaker E:** Just Paul?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, the other thing I was gonna say, because you asked about difficulty being in silence, and I like to skip all of the— I like to go right to the root of things.

**Speaker E:** So the— I could clarify In the sense, when things are calm, there seems to be a pull or a discomfort being calm. Like when the mental thoughts have calmed down.

**Speaker D:** So, you feel there's a resistance to being calm?

**Speaker E:** I think there's a discomfort, maybe the body is not used to being that way. Because, you know, that's how it has been. It's not used to keeping calm, so maybe just wants to go to its fortress of solitude, you know, or delusion within thoughts. So there seems to be a little bit of discomfort there, and maybe a few moments of calm, and then I can feel that, okay, body is like uncomfortable and just wants to go into thoughts, and then I calm that down, I can, you know, come back to the breath, and then I can see a pull again. So perhaps the skill is not developed to calm it down enough.

**Speaker D:** No, you're just noticing reality, because, you know, the fundamental primordial Dukkha is this is this like that, you know, our sense of existence, uh, in terms of how it's seen in dependent origination is, is again, it's craving-born. It's something that has to be maintained. Um, and, uh, and what allows the maintenance of our existence is our ignorance of the process that maintains it. That's what the Four Noble Truths reveal. So the hardest thing in the world to do is to sit alone in a quiet room with no stimulation. The way Bodhidharma broke this delusion is by staring at a blank wall for, what, 13 years or whatever he stared at it for, because there's nothing in that blank wall that can give rise to delight or craving and then, you know, clinging, existence, birth and death, and Dukkha. But this is a process we're unconsciously maintaining, and or at least craving's unconsciously maintaining it, and it's maintained through our lack of awareness of it. And so when you try to sit alone in a quiet room that it's right there, and your ability to avoid it becomes more difficult. So that's where that discomfort is. It's what— that's what avijja is. It's the mind turning away from noticing this maintenance of being. So it makes us— it's what makes it so tiring and so painful, is because we're unconsciously maintaining our sense of existence with everything that we do. And If you could, and then that's also rooted in our relationship to feeling. We're averse to unpleasant feeling. We're attracted to pleasant feeling, and we become confused and disoriented and doubtful about neutral feeling. And so the mind is always shaking, essentially. It's like a snow globe that you're constantly shaking. In order to keep the activities moving. And that— those— the activity of the mind is what we— is what gives us our sense of self and our sense of identity. So when you try to allow that to cease, yeah, there's a fear that arises, there's a craving for existence that arises, and then you just want to start shaking the mind again. So you'll, you know, you'll want to do something. You want to like calm yourself down with the breath, or you'll want to think about some other kind of thought, or seek out some kind of sensual pleasure, or daydream, or go to sleep, or anything except let everything— except allow cessation to happen. And so that's what that tendency is. It's a resistance to allowing cessation to happen. It'll happen on its own, but it takes a training in order to allow it to happen on its own. So that's how you discover Dukkha, is by not giving the mind any of its food, essentially. You know, the Buddha talks about the four nutriments.

**Speaker B:** Of being.

**Speaker D:** He talks about physical food, contact, consciousness, and intellectual intention, essentially. And so these are the four things that consciousness itself, as he says, like finds a landing place. And when it finds a landing place and it finds delight, then it grows into being, essentially. This is the process of how being is created. So when we try to put a stop to that process, we get a we get like a subtle sense of existential anxiety that keeps us from allowing it to happen, essentially. That's why people go crazy in solitary confinement. They feel terrified of being alone. They don't like being in the dark, you know. They don't like to not be thought about by their peers, essentially, you know. Social death feels like death because it is death, because what's actually born is a is a relational sense of self, but we're maintaining that.

**Speaker E:** Yeah. If I may ask, another thing that comes up is the buzzing in the ear, and it seems to change pitches. Is that common?

**Speaker A:** Tinnitus.

**Speaker D:** I was going to say. It's possible. So wait, is the buzzing like a— is it a high frequency sound, or is it just a buzzing sound? Like, what is it?

**Speaker E:** It is high-ish, yeah. It does keep changing sometimes.

**Speaker D:** You know, I wouldn't jump to say it's tinnitus. Does it bother you a lot?

**Speaker E:** Initially it did. It started around 2 years back after practice, I think. So now it doesn't. Now I'm used to it.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, well, I would say what Ajahn Chah would say is don't bother the sound. You know, the sound doesn't bother you, you bother the sound, even if it's an internal sound. And also, don't— there's no need to mystify or like make any particular phenomena that's experienced important, more important than the other. Like In order for the mind to— in order for you to get into an understanding of what the mind is, you have to train your attention to put down all objects of phenomena, because the mind isn't in the objects. That sound is a phenomena, you know, it's an object of the ear. And so, you know, the way to treat any phenomena, whether it's sound, sight, or even like meditation experiences is just to not pick them up. You know, the mind will on its own withdraw if you just train the mind not to pick anything up, essentially. And then that full withdrawal is what the Buddha calls we wake up. And then that's when you sort of get familiar with like what the mind actually is. Instead of mistaking phenomena for the mind.

**Speaker A:** How much minutes are left? How much minutes?

**Speaker D:** I guess in short, just don't worry about it, the buzzing. Just let it be.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's amazing what humans can get used to.

**Speaker D:** It's true. Hi, fella. I used to have a big problem.

**Speaker E:** With sound.

**Speaker B:** That was helpful.

**Speaker E:** Yeah. Initially, I could see aversion within that, so I just practiced that out. So.

**Speaker A:** It'S good.

**Speaker D:** She's going through a climbing phase. Oh, I keep finding her on top of things. Yeah, and she's only 18 months old, so.

**Speaker A:** This, this guy Jordan Peterson, he had great advice. He's like, if your kid's doing something dangerous within reason, you know, balancing on a log, something like this, but if they're doing it carefully and they're concentrating, don't— he said don't interfere too much. Because they're developing their skills for whatever, you know. Yeah, and that sounds simple, but I thought that was such a nice thing because my son used to climb on this wall thing here, and my immediate reaction was, get down, you know, blah blah. But I let him, and he's developed quite a good balance, I believe, from it, you know.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I would say I'm almost too much on the non-interventionist side. My wife gets pretty mad at me. She's like, all these things that happen when they're with you would never happen with with me. And I'm like, yeah, but then they wouldn't develop any, like, somatic awareness, or like, you know, anyway. But yeah, I've heard that. I didn't know it was from Jordan Peterson, but I agree with it. Let kids be dangerous, carefully.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, he probably highlighted it. But yeah, that's— it is interesting. I like with children, I always tell myself, with all things, with all things, just balance, you know, not too strict, not too loose, not too this, not too that. A nice harmony, nice harmonious plants, growing a plant. I think that's what Jiddu Krishnamurti said, children is like growing a plant, you know, you got to let them be free, but also you got to tend to them a little bit. Anyways, you guys rock, man, it's been great talking with you. I got to get going because this guy wants to play in the snow.

**Speaker D:** All right, nice. I'm jealous. Yeah, I know.

**Speaker A:** What's that?

**Speaker D:** I said I'm jealous that you have snow.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, we only got a little this Christmas, but apparently now it's gonna be 10 inches. They say it doesn't look like it though, but apparently in a couple days too, they say. But we'll see, we'll see how it goes.

**Speaker D:** We do have snow in the mountains above my house, so it's only 20 minutes like up the— oh nice, there's like a country road right next to my house that goes straight up into the mountains. It takes like 20 minutes to get there.

**Speaker A:** Colorado?

**Speaker D:** Uh, what, are you asking where I live?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, what state?

**Speaker D:** I live in the Pacific Northwest.

**Speaker A:** Oh, okay, cool.

**Speaker B:** Probably.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it was good seeing you guys again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, good seeing you.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, enjoy the snow.

**Speaker A:** Okay, yeah, much peace and love, dudes.

**Speaker C:** Peace.

**Speaker D:** Peace and love.

**Speaker C:** Peace and love.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk is a casual, friendly conversation among practitioners (Sangha friends) touching on several key themes of Buddhist practice. Here is a summary of the core Dhamma points discussed:

**Main Themes:**

1.  **The Natural Ebb and Flow of Practice:** The talk opens with an acknowledgment that the zeal or **ardency** for practice naturally "comes and goes." The emphasis is on allowing this fluctuation without self-judgment, relating to practice contextually rather than with forced urgency.

2.  **Simplicity and "Good Enough":** A central thread is the relief found in simplifying practice. The idea that "good enough is okay" and that one doesn't need to "become something or evolve into something" is highlighted as freeing. The goal is contentment with things as they are, not as we want them to be.

3.  **Silence as the Foundation:** The group explores **silence** not merely as the absence of sound, but as a deep, peaceful equanimity of mind and heart. It is described as:
    *   The "ground for speech and sound itself."
    *   A natural state revealed when we stop identifying with the chaotic thinking mind.
    *   Connected to the meditative experience of **jhana**, where it represents a cessation of the mental chatter that maintains our sense of a craving-based self.

4.  **Working with the Mind and Body:** Practical insights are shared:
    *   The brain's chaos is natural; peace comes from **dis-identifying** with it and taking refuge in the breath (ānāpānasati).
    *   There's a noted **resistance or discomfort** when the mind/body settles into calm, as it is unused to not being "shaken" by constant activity. This is seen as a normal part of the process.
    *   The practice involves gently returning to the breath when distracted, trusting in **impermanence (anicca)**—that chaotic states will pass.

5.  **Kamma as Moment-to-Moment Opportunity:** Kamma is framed positively as each new moment offering a fresh chance to choose peace and non-harm. By not acting out of greed, aversion, or delusion, we "create no more negative Kamma" and instead generate **sukkha** (happiness/ease).

6.  **Integrating Practice with Daily Life:** Practice is shown not as separate from life but woven into it—through generosity (helping parents, community libraries), mindful socializing, and using simple objects (like a keychain or a star-shaped wand) as reminders of Dhamma principles.

**Overall Tone & Conclusion:**
The conversation is warm, supportive, and meandering, reflecting a **Sangha** simply sharing their journey. The underlying message is one of **ease and acceptance**: letting go of striving, forgiving oneself, finding joy in simplicity, and seeing the Dhamma in everyday activities—from playing in the snow to handling historical artifacts. The ultimate encouragement is to relax, breathe, and allow understanding to unfold naturally.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, here are the key metaphors and stories used in the talk:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Practice as "Swimmingly" and "Soup":**
    *   Speaker C describes practice as going "quite swimmingly" (smoothly and successfully).
    *   Speaker B then extends this into a metaphor: **"If it was soup, what kind of soup would it be?"** Speaker C responds that the flavors change, sometimes sour, sometimes savory, leading to the identification of **"Hot and sour soup."** Speaker B then concludes, **"It's like life,"** using the soup to represent the dynamic, changing, and sometimes contrasting nature of both practice and lived experience.

2.  **The Mind/Body Relationship as "Oil and Water":**
    *   Speaker D (Michael) references Ajahn Chah, describing the meditative state of silence (jhana) where the mind and body separate: **"the oil and water separating out."** This metaphor illustrates the experience of the mind and body existing in distinct, non-mixing domains.

3.  **The Agitated Mind as a "Snow Globe":**
    *   Speaker D uses this metaphor to explain why silence is uncomfortable: **"It's like a snow globe that you're constantly shaking. In order to keep the activities moving... the activity of the mind is what gives us our sense of self... when you try to allow that to cease... you just want to start shaking the mind again."** This vividly depicts the mind's habitual turbulence and the resistance to stillness.

4.  **The Forest of Imperfection:**
    *   Speaker A references Alan Watts to counter perfectionism: **"It's like what Alan Watts would say about the trees. They don't have to grow perfectly straight in the forest. Some are sick, some are old, some die, some zag this way and zig that way. But that's the beauty of nature."** This metaphor champions natural variation and inherent acceptance over rigid ideals.

5.  **Cultivation:**
    *   Speaker C connects a physical artifact to practice: While handling an indigenous cultivating stone used for tilling earth, he thinks, **"it comes back to Dharma. It's like cultivating the mind, right?"** This ties the physical act of farming to the mental work of spiritual practice.

6.  **Guidelines vs. Absolutes:**
    *   Speaker A contrasts spiritual frameworks with rigid rules: **"Everything is a guideline... our Western mindset is more about... climb the mountain mentality."** The **"climb the mountain"** metaphor here represents the striving, goal-oriented approach he suggests letting go of.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Story of the Snow Plow:**
    *   Speaker C shares a brief, positive story about someone with a plow clearing his icy driveway without being asked, calling it a **"very nice kind act."** This serves as a real-world example of unexpected generosity.

2.  **Helping Family (Two Stories):**
    *   Speaker C tells two stories about "straight up generosity":
        *   Helping his father with a history presentation by setting up equipment due to his father's poor eyesight.
        *   Helping his mother manage a "little library," picking up and cycling books donated by a neighbor.

3.  **The Mr. Rogers Practice:**
    *   Speaker C recalls a scene from a Mr. Rogers movie: **"he practices, he kind of like prays for people where he just chants their name over and over again."** He then relates this to his own practice of remembering names and holding wholesome thoughts for people as a form of metta (loving-kindness) in social situations.

4.  **The Gift of the Keychain and Wands:**
    *   Speaker C thanks Speaker B (Brett) for gifts: letters used as bookmarks, a keychain, and "wands" (a five-pointed star). He explains how he uses the star as a physical reminder of the **"five faculties or the five powers"** in Buddhist practice, turning everyday objects into aids for mindfulness.

5.  **Sri Ramana's Silent Talk:**
    *   Speaker B shares a personal anecdote about being distracted from practice and then finding samadhi (concentration) only after playing a video of Sri Ramana Maharshi that included **"actual auditory oral segments of silence."** This story highlights the power of external silence to cue internal stillness.

6.  **Bhante Puññaji's Photo Joke:**
    *   Speaker D references a joke to explain the difference between our mental self-image and our actual physical body: **"you pick up the photo and you look at it and be like, 'that's not me'"** because the photo doesn't match the **"craving-born"** mental image we identify with.

7.  **Bodhidharma's Wall-Gazing:**
    *   Speaker D references the legendary founder of Zen, **Bodhidharma**, who **"stared at a blank wall for... 13 years."** He uses this story to illustrate the extreme difficulty of facing silence without stimulation, which forces a confrontation with the mind's inherent discomfort.

8.  **Jordan Peterson's Child-Rearing Advice:**
    *   Speaker A references **Jordan Peterson's advice** about letting children carefully engage in slightly dangerous activities (like balancing) to develop skills and somatic awareness. He connects this to the broader principle of **balance and harmonious growth**, referencing **Jiddu Krishnamurti's** idea that **"children is like growing a plant."**

**In summary**, the conversation uses metaphors drawn from nature (trees, soup, cultivation), common objects (snow globes, oil and water), and relatable experiences to describe abstract aspects of meditation and philosophy. The stories are personal, historical, or cultural anecdotes that ground the discussion in real actions, generosity, and practical wisdom.
