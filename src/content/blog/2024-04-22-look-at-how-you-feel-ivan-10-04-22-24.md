### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Yeah, um, yeah, I was saying basically small problems are usually one that, that just, that just triggers me or whatever. It's not a big problem, I usually can handle it. And I was— but yeah, it may be the problem is because I see them as problems, as you said. If I can just see as things as unfolding I realize I took it very personally when small things arises.

**Speaker B:** More issues. And you don't like it. That's what creates the selfishness, is because you don't like it. You take things personally because you don't like it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, you called them irritations. Yeah, okay. So let's take it as an example would be a skin itch, an irritation, maybe a bug bite, a tick, or, um, a mosquito. And, uh, that bite irritates the skin and gives sensations. Okay, so it's the skin that's irritated. When you don't like that, uh, skin irritation, you become irritated. Yeah, and you're not the skin. So you can put some distance in there. That in fact, one of the things that I've heard from philosophy, and it makes enough sense to use, and that is, is that when you're really close to something, that you're it. The closer to it you are, the more it you are. And the distance is moving away from it. And the further away you are from something, the less it is you. An example would be if there is a riot in Detroit, that's not you. But if there's a riot on your block, then that's you, because you're the block. If there's a riot in your front yard, then that's your riot because it's in your front yard. But that same riot can be in Detroit and it's not yours. You don't care about it. All right, so in that regard, when the skin is irritated, the skin may in fact be 3, 4 feet away and you can do something to rub the skin. But when you're very close to it, that makes you this irritated, not just the skin.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right, if that's the case, then maybe the easy thing to do is to put some distance between you and the irritation. So that it's not you that's irritated, it's just an irritation, it's just a riot, it's just a mob, it's just a skin irritation, but it's not you that's irritated.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker B:** However, what happens is, is that you get close to it with the feeling of not liking. This is why we in fact call things a problem, is because we race towards it because we don't like it. We invite things that we don't like and almost invariably push things away that are okay. So Can you begin to see the not liking before you call it a problem? Can you see your feelings of not liking?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** This is what we were talking about yesterday and all kinds of times. In the case of the Paticcasamuppada, if you have wisdom at the point of contact, then the feelings that arise, you have some control over. And grasping and clinging is actually the same thing as rushing towards it.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Yeah, I see it now.

**Speaker B:** Um, so mindfulness is going to be for you to recognize you're, uh, not liking before you become irritated, before you think that it's a problem. You can just see, I don't like it.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** And if you can see that you don't like it, now you have a whole lot more that you can do with it. For instance, if there's a skin irritation, you can put a balm, a monkey balm, a tiger balm a lotion, you can put medicine on it, but if you don't like it, you'll scratch it. Well, if that's true of a skin irritation, that's true of anything. That in fact, that's what you call it a problem, is because you're scratching at something that you don't like. And when you're scratching at stuff, whether it's a wife or a house or whatever it is, you're making it worse, not better. In fact, the extreme example is when the doctor comes to a home visit and he can't open his doctor's bag, and so he in frustration pulls out a gun and shoots the bag.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so that's the scratching. And in this case, it's an extreme example, is that he pulls out a gun and shoots the bag because he can't open it. But if we take things with wisdom, maybe he could see that it's got a latch on it or something like that, maybe take a little pen knife and move and jiggle something so that the bag opens, he didn't have to shoot it with a gun.

**Speaker A:** You were saying the mosquito analogy, and it really reminds me of something that happened recently. Because I'm living in Malaysia, I think the weather is almost similar as in Thailand, which is quite Well, at least other people's perception say it's really hot recently. For me, I just find it normal. I don't really find it hot, because I know what hot really feels like. To me, this is normal, but I hear a lot of people saying it's hot, and it really got me thinking about this sensation of disliking Does it also come with understanding? Because, well, maybe I'm reaching here, but it's like, because from my perspective, I have an appreciation for the weather. I know real hot is there's no wind, and then, you know, it's dry and humid. That's real hot. I felt it before because I know what the worst is like. To me this is okay. I actually kind of enjoy the hot. It's not really that hot. So I guess what I'm trying to ask is, I feel like when the wisdom is also understanding that things is not really that bad. Is this sort of like this sort of knowledge maybe? I'm not sure.

**Speaker B:** All right. So that means then that you can start telling yourself that it's not that bad. It's not a big deal. It's just because you don't like it doesn't make it a big deal. But when you're close to anything, it looks big, and when you're far away from it, it looks small.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and it sounds like the ability to The ability to get a distance from the object is also knowledge, right? I don't know, because it's like a knowledge of actually seeing things from many angles. I guess that's what I was thinking about. Because, yeah, because I feel like when I'm in this victim mindset, I can only see from one angle. It's this tunnel vision.

**Speaker B:** Well, yeah, that's another thing about getting some distance from it is, is that you can get a better perspective. You can— but when you're really close to it, then it's like blinders. You can only see that which is right in front of you. You don't have a perspective.

**Speaker A:** Yes, and so it's also something I've been thinking about, which is the Right View. You mentioned it before, Right View has nothing to do with the worldly kind of right view. It is— yeah, I'm asking, like— Right.

**Speaker B:** When you say it that way, you're making it into a verb, Right View. A much better way of saying it is right viewing. Yeah, right, into a verb, not a noun.

**Speaker A:** Looking, seeing.

**Speaker B:** It's not really right view, that's just bad translation.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, bad translation. So right viewing, right?

**Speaker B:** Right viewing, looking, and not looking closely, but looking from a distance, gazing at it.

**Speaker A:** All right, I think now that you say this, now I think it was my inability to see that feeling of 'I don't like it' arising, and I stand too close to it. Yeah, it makes sense now.

**Speaker B:** And so you, once you see that you don't like it, you can bring some wisdom to it. You can begin to see that leaving and know that you have a choice about how you feel.

**Speaker A:** Hmm.

**Speaker B:** Rather than chasing after it, getting close to it, becoming it— that's the grasping and clinging, that's the carrying it around. You have to be pretty close to something to carry it, to care about.

**Speaker A:** It. I guess I have the bad habit of standing in too close, because it's an old habit of mine that if I stand really close, I can begin to see where can I fix this. When, if I'm really being honest, I feel like 90% of the time it makes things worse.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that's right. That if you've got a broken TV right in the room with you, then every time you see it, every time you look at it, you have thoughts of, oh, I need to repair it. But if you take that old broken TV and throw it out, throw it in the city dump where you're nowhere around it— out of sight is out of mind— and so you don't have the thought, I gotta fix that old TV, when in fact you don't have to fix it. You're doing fine right now without it. So you can take that analogy of an old broken TV and bring it to everything. Funny thing about the— in the South, the United— the southern part of the United States, many, many yards of houses are, are, uh, cluttered with broken things that are never fixed. It makes the house look junky, and it makes the people who feel bad, uh, because they keep seeing the broken stuff. They'd be better off if they have that old junk car hauled off, and that washing machine, and all the stuff that they put out in the yard. But we cling to all of the broken, dead stuff. We keep it close at hand.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Better to throw that stuff out. You're not going to fix it anyway. You're just going to feel bad every time you see it.

**Speaker A:** Now it makes too much sense. I was early on, I was trying to organize my drawer which I haven't opened for months, and when I opened, I see some of the broken stuff. It's funny, I didn't see it for months, I was feeling okay. When I see it, I was like, oh, I have to fix this, I have to fix that, I feel bad. Oh, this is too funny. Okay, all right.

**Speaker B:** So the job is to start looking at how you feel.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, yes, it makes sense. Yes.

**Speaker B:** And when you recognize that you feel bad, you can also put it together. This is that you feel bad just because you made that stuff up. The example would be, oh, I've got to go fix that old wrecked car. That's just a thought.

**Speaker A:** Okay?

**Speaker B:** It's just a thought, and it's based upon of what we see. And so we see and we process it. Now, it's possible, let us say, for a little kid who's had that piece of junk car in his yard for his whole life, he actually likes it. Every time the kid sees that car, he says, wow, I remember that car. But his dad comes and looks at the car, and he's got— I gotta fix it. And the dad feels bad, and the kid's just okay with So it's not the wrecked car itself, but every time you see it, you process it and bring up a feeling. Oh, I've got to fix it is the thought, and then the feeling is a bad feeling. Oh, it's going to be hard to fix. Oh, I don't know, it's such a trouble, it's such a problem.

**Speaker A:** Hmm.

**Speaker B:** And actually, the older things get, the more difficult they are actually to fix.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker B:** Cars rust, relationships fall apart, and better thing to do is just throw it out and move on.

**Speaker A:** I'm laughing because, yeah, it's, it's really that simple. Why do we complicate it? Oh my God.

**Speaker B:** It really is that simple. There's nothing to do. However, when we feel bad, we think that we've got to do something to fix it so that I won't feel bad. And that is the height of ignorance. That's the real stupidity the Buddha talks about. That's the Ajiva, the not seeing and not knowing, to recognize that the feelings are not going to improve because you fixed one junk car, because your whole yard's full of junk cars. You'll feel a little bit okay when you fix one of them, but then you've got all of these others to fix, and there comes the bad feelings again. So it's better to work on those bad feelings directly rather than indirectly. This is why Buddhism, the teaching of the Buddha, is referred to as the direct method. Go straight to the feelings and fix them, and don't go try to fix the wreck in order to feel good. Go directly to fix the feeling.

**Speaker A:** But.

**Speaker B:** You got to see the feeling first, because automatically we shortcut that and we don't even recognize that we feel bad, have a negative reaction, we have ill will towards it. Instead, We immediately jump to, I have to fix it, without even looking at that intermediate stage of, I don't like it, therefore I have the thought I need to fix it. So keep watching your feelings.

**Speaker A:** I have one about in the context of actions. Like, let's say I have unskillful action and I want to fix that, turn into a skillful. So is that indirect fixing, indirect way of approaching some? Is that similar? I don't know, it's a bit confusing to me. If I were to give an example, it would be, let's say, I have certain addictions and I feel good when I every day I stay away from it and just keep the mind gladdened. Is that because I think subtly it's like I want to do this so I can feel good about myself. I don't know, it's— is it— I think it's a similar thing. Maybe I'm just confusing it. Okay.

**Speaker B:** All right, so the practice is, is to remember to look at how you feel. Okay, keep remembering to look at how you feel, because if you look at how you feel and recognize that you feel bad then you can change that feeling. You can begin to ignore the stuff that you use to feel bad because you made it up anyway. If you can recognize, if you can start having mindfulness where you can see how you feel, you can begin to see how you got impacted by that. This is what Bhikkhu Buddhadasa what we call wisdom at the point of contact. Look at how things impact you, how they touch you, so that you can begin to control how you feel about it. The best way to begin to feel about it is by touching yourself in a better way. Oh, I've got to do it. Is touching yourself so that you feel bad. I'll get around to it, I can do that. Then that's touching yourself in a brand new way. Oh yeah, I can do that. Oh yeah, we can put it off, we don't need to do it now, not a big deal. No, the first thing you need to do is to start looking at how you feel. Then you begin to see how it— what it was that impacted you, and then you can make a change about how it— what's happening that impacts you so that you can begin to control those feelings.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you can do that. You can start looking at how you feel.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker B:** But you're going too far. Once you feel bad, now you've made it into a problem. And all really that was happening is you didn't like it and you were ignorant about not liking it, and so you created it into a problem. The reality was, and the important point was, is that you didn't like it.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so you go practice watching your feelings. You can do that anytime— when you're playing with your cell phone, when you're eating food, when you're on the toilet, any place. Start watching how you feel right now.

**Speaker A:** I feel okay right now.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, let's go ahead and finish this call now, and you just continue to look at how you feel. You can control your feelings if you watch them.

**Speaker A:** Yes. All right, thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** Yes, you can do this.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** All right, we'll see you later.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B), centers on a core insight: **our suffering arises not from external events themselves, but from our reactive "disliking" of them and our subsequent habit of identifying with that reaction.**

Here is a summary of the key points:

**1. The Root of "Problems":** Small irritations become problems because we **take them personally** and **dislike** the experience. This "disliking" is the seed of suffering (dukkha).

**2. The Importance of Distance:** Dhammarato uses the analogy of a skin itch or a riot. If a riot is in a distant city, it doesn't bother you. If it's in your front yard, you feel it's "yours." Similarly, when an irritation arises (e.g., a bug bite, a critical comment), we mentally "rush towards it" and fuse with it. The practice is to **create mental distance**—to see the irritation as a mere event, not as *who you are*. "It's just a skin irritation, but it's not *you* that's irritated."

**3. Mindfulness of Disliking:** The critical skill is to **catch the feeling of "I don't like this" *before* it hardens into irritation and a "problem."** This moment of mindfulness creates a gap where wisdom can intervene.

**4. Wrong & Right Response:** When we dislike something, our unskillful habit is to "scratch at it" (e.g., obsess, worry, retaliate), which only makes it worse (like shooting a doctor's bag because it won't open). Wisdom allows us to respond skillfully or simply let it be.

**5. Perspective is Wisdom:** Speaker A shares an example about hot weather. Because they have experienced worse heat, the current heat is seen as "not that bad" and is even enjoyable. This illustrates that **wisdom involves perspective**—seeing things from multiple angles, not just the tunnel vision of a "victim mindset." This perspective is a form of **"right viewing"** (better understood as the *verb* "right seeing").

**6. The "Broken TV" Analogy:** We cling to mental and physical "broken things" (past grievances, unfinished tasks, regrets), keeping them close. Every time we see them, we think "I must fix this" and feel bad. Often, the wise choice is to simply "throw it out" of your mind—to let it go. Out of sight, out of mind.

**7. The Direct Path of the Dhamma:** We typically try to fix external things (the broken car, the other person) to feel better. This is the indirect, endless path. **The Buddha's direct path is to go straight to the feeling itself.** Recognize the bad feeling, see that it is mentally constructed, and learn to let it go or change it through wise reflection. You fix the *feeling*, not the external wreck.

**8. Practical Instruction:** The core practice is to **continuously "look at how you feel."** This mindfulness allows you to see how external contacts impact you. With that awareness, you can choose to "touch yourself" (your mind) in a better way—with calming, forgiving, or humorous thoughts—rather than with thoughts that create more pressure and dislike.

**Conclusion:** The talk guides the practitioner away from fixing the world and toward mastering their inner world. The formula is:
1.  **Notice** the feeling (especially "disliking").
2.  **Create distance**—don't become the feeling.
3.  **Gain perspective**—see it's "not that bad" or not personal.
4.  **Choose a wise response** or simply let go, rather than "scratching."
5.  **Release** the mental "junk" you've been carrying.

The ultimate goal is to stop creating problems out of life's inevitable irritations by changing your relationship to the feeling of dislike.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary speaker (Speaker B, Dhammarato) uses several **metaphors** and one extended **story** to illustrate the core teaching about creating distance from irritations and observing feelings.

Here are the key metaphors and stories used:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The Skin Irritation / Mosquito Bite:** This is the central, extended metaphor.
    *   **What it is:** A bug bite that irritates the skin.
    *   **What it represents:** A minor life irritation or problem.
    *   **The lesson:** The skin is irritated, but *you* are not the skin. If you dislike the sensation, *you* become irritated. The key is to create distance between your sense of self ("you") and the physical sensation ("the skin's irritation"), so that "it's just a skin irritation, but it's not *you* that's irritated."

2.  **The Riot (Geographic Distance Metaphor):** This metaphor builds on the concept of psychological distance.
    *   **What it is:** A riot happening in different locations (Detroit, your block, your front yard).
    *   **What it represents:** Problems or disturbances.
    *   **The lesson:** The closer the "riot" is to you physically/psychologically, the more you feel it is "yours" and are affected by it. If it's far away (Detroit), you don't care. The goal is to mentally move problems from "your front yard" to "Detroit"—to create emotional and cognitive distance.

3.  **The Broken TV / Junkyard:**
    *   **What it is:** An old, broken TV in your room, or a yard cluttered with broken appliances and a junk car.
    *   **What it represents:** Unresolved problems, past issues, or burdens we cling to.
    *   **The lesson:** Keeping "broken" things close at hand (in your mind or environment) makes you feel bad every time you see them because you think "I must fix this." The solution is to "haul it off" or "throw it out"—to mentally let go of the burden. "Out of sight, out of mind." You realize you are doing fine without fixing it.

4.  **Scratching the Itch:**
    *   **What it is:** The compulsive action of scratching a mosquito bite.
    *   **What it represents:** Our unskillful, reactive attempts to "fix" a problem we don't like (e.g., nagging a spouse, obsessing over a house issue).
    *   **The lesson:** Scratching (reacting with dislike) usually makes the irritation worse. Wise action (like applying balm) requires first not reacting from a place of "I don't like this."

### **Story**

1.  **The Doctor and the Bag (Extreme Example/Anecdote):**
    *   **What happens:** A doctor, frustrated that he can't open his bag, pulls out a gun and shoots it.
    *   **What it represents:** The absurd, destructive extreme of reacting with "scratching" (ill will/frustration) to a minor obstacle.
    *   **The lesson:** This is what unwise, reactive problem-solving looks like. With wisdom and perspective (creating distance), you would see a simpler solution (like jiggling the latch). The story humorously underscores how our "dislike" can make us act irrationally and make things worse.

### **Connecting Theme**

All these metaphors and the story serve one core idea: **Psychological distance creates perspective.** By metaphorically "stepping back" from an irritation (seeing it as a distant riot, a separate skin itch, or junk to be removed), you stop identifying with it ("this is *my* big problem"). This distance allows you to see the initial feeling of **"I don't like this"** before it hardens into a "problem" that you must frantically "scratch" or "fix." The ultimate goal is to use mindfulness to observe that initial feeling of dislike directly, rather than being unconsciously propelled by it into reactive suffering.
