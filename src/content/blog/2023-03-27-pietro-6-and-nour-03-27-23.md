### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, okay, yes. So Pedro, we've been talking for a while. Yeah, and we decided to turn the video recorder on, and so we can continue with our discussion about beginning to watch the mind, and that watching part, which is actually in Western meditation is called mindfulness, is actually part of the Eightfold Noble Path, which has to do with both the waking up to be in reality, to be in the present moment, and then to investigate. That is actually quite possible for people to be mindful in a kind of a wrong way because they're just mindfully aware that they're stuck in the past or they're feeling really bad. Okay, but in fact, if you stump your toe and it hurts, you're really, really mindful of it hurting. And so this is not the kind of mindfulness that we're talking about, but rather The Sati is kind of to wake up into the present moment, to come out of our daydreams or to come out of our thoughts into our sensory awareness. That this is in fact why the breath is so valuable, is because basically when you're sitting doing nothing but the mind has wandered away, then coming back to the breath is really easy because that's the only thing you're really doing anyway. But now what we do is when we come back to the breath, we're actually going to seize or take control of the breathing, to start breathing in a slightly different way. Either immediately before that or immediately after we seize the breath, we're also going to kind of seize the mind or investigate the mind or turn it from whatever daydream we were having and to wake up to the present moment of that I was daydreaming. Now, what was that daydream? Or a better thing to say is, never mind the daydream, let's just come back into the present moment. Okay. And then the next thoughts that we can have would be wholesome. Now, sometimes when we wake up, it's quite obvious when we wake up what we were thinking. Like having an argument, we're thinking about having the argument that we had with Judy two weeks ago or just two hours ago, okay? Whatever was going on, now we recognize that that's what we're thinking about and we don't feel too good about it at all. So we can in fact change the kind of thoughts that we're having, like, wow, I'm glad I don't have to have Judy to argue with right now, is an example of that. So, we can brighten up the thoughts, or we can change them, change the subject completely into a different kind of happy thought, which would be the kind of happy thought of right here, right now, in this present moment, including no Judy. There is no Judy here now. There's no reason for me to argue with Judy. Judy's not here. Let's pay attention to what is here, okay? Because it's actually quite possible for someone to be sitting in meditation and doing some good, and then all of a sudden the thoughts of Judy and that argument come up. Then they spend a few minutes thinking about Judy and that argument, and then they get up from their meditation cushions and go start the argument with Judy again. That's very possible. And so then the question would be, well, why did you get up off your meditation cushion? Why did you do that? And the answer is either, I don't know, or I actually got up off the cushion so I could go continue to argue with Judy. That I thought at that time that it was important. Okay, so if we can sit there and wake up to the point of, oh, I don't have to argue with Judy at all, she's not here, therefore I can just sit here and feel good. No Judy, no place to go, nothing to do, and I can just sit here and enjoy the moment. I can enjoy breathing, I can enjoy watching the breath. These are the kind of wholesome thoughts that we can have, and that those are the kind of wholesome thoughts that kind of lead to the end of action. The Buddha talks about that. Actions that lead to the end of action is to set up roadblocks or barriers or things for all of these thoughts that do actually lead to action. An example of that is, is that if the police want to catch somebody, the easy thing for them to do is to just set a trap or up in front. And stop the traffic. You know, taking some barriers and put out in the road is very easy to do, and that stops an awful lot of traffic. So we can do that in the mind also. We can divert the traffic, put the mind into a detour, or we can just stop it and basically do something else with the mind. And both of these things would then be called right effort. The right effort to change what the mind is doing. And so one of the things that I do for the students after they start practicing on the cushion is we can begin to bring the actual practices that we're doing out into our day. An example of that is you're sitting in the car, so whenever you get into the car, you can ask yourself the question of, why am I getting into this car? Where am I going? Or when you're sitting in a chair at home, as you stand up, you can ask yourself, "I'm sitting in this comfortable chair and everything is hunky-dory, why am I getting up? What's the point? Especially if I'm going off to do something unvaluable, unwholesome." Because there's absolutely reasons to get up out of the chair that are valuable and wholesome, like going to the toilet or something like that. But going to raid the refrigerator may not be such a wholesome thing to do. And so, many of the students have jobs in offices where they spend most of their time sitting in a chair. And so, the meditation practice is that every time that you get out of the chair, stop. And stand up. You see, when we get out of a chair, almost always and invariably when we're getting out of the chair, we're getting out of the chair moving. We're walking already. In fact, the way that we put our feet down is so that we can stand up and move. So now we're going to start, uh, coming out of the chair into just the standing posture. Okay. And then, and there we can reflect why Am I getting out of the chair? What's so important that I'm losing my easy chair, coming out of my comfortable place? What's the point? Is it in fact no longer comfortable? Because that's a really good reason to get out of the chair, is because your butt hurts, or some chakra or something. So then we start to move. Now here's something that will happen with students when they start to practice this. That in the first week or so they will remember late. They'll get out of the chair and take 5, 10, or 20 steps, and then they'll remember, oh, I was going to stand up. And so the thing to do then is not go back to the chair, but to stand there when you do remember that you did wake up and say, aha, look, I did wake up. Now that I woke up, why did I get out of the chair? Where am I going? What's the point? Is it wholesome or not? And this is a good way to start training the mind in the real world, because you're going to be, what, getting up out of a chair 20, 30 times a day, 10 times a day. So that's 10 times a day you can use that chair and getting out of the chair as an anchor to just stand and reflect upon what's happening, including the fact that you got out of the chair. Okay, so the next part of that would be that every time that we open a door— opening the car door, whether we're getting into the car, opening the car door to get out of it, opening the door to the elevator, opening this or that door— The question then would be still arising: where am I going? Why am I going through this door? And we start to build up some history of really watching what we're doing and where we're going. Yeah, wow, an old friend calling. I'll let him in. Nor, been a long time. Good to see you. Your head is cut off at your chin. Can you change your video? Okay, now you're cutting off at the eyes. Yeah, that's good, that works. Ah, your hair is different. So where are you? Are you in Tunisia? Okay, we were just talking about a new kind of sitting meditation. And so you can listen in, talking to Pedro here, and for consistency's sake on the video, we'll go ahead and continue with that. That when we go to stand up to get out of a chair, instead of just standing up and walking, we're going to stand up and reflect: Why do we stand up? Where are we going? What's the point of this? Is it wholesome or not? It's actually quite possible that we would sit right back down and say, "Well, I'm glad I thought that. I don't really have to go see that guy." Or, "Well, I'm glad I saw that. Now I don't have to go buy that pack of cigarettes or spend money," or whatever we were thinking about. And so it gives us a time to reflect. We can also do that when we open a door. Wow, why am I going into this store? What's the point? Then we begin to recognize that sometimes we're going in with a shopping list, and sometimes we're going in just to have the pleasure of looking at the baubles that they have to sell, looking for something nice. Those two things are hunter-gatherer mentalities. One is having a shopping list, knowing what you're going, you go hunting, you go looking for it. And the other one is, oh, I'll just go in and just look around and buy whatever I like, which is the gathering quality that we have. And so we can begin to look at that. Why are we going where we're going? What are we doing? What's the point? In other words, begin to wake up to what wholesome things we're doing and what unwholesome things we're doing. So, sorry Dhammarato, is there at the.

**Speaker B:** End a difference to the Dharma or to the Buddha, where good action or bad action means something regarding to no action at all, like ending of action is Which is more important, good action or the ending of action? Or is important the ending of bad action?

**Speaker A:** Wow, you are really, really, really out there with so many of the people. Let me explain it this way. If you've got a truck going at 100 miles an hour and you stand in front of it to stop it, it's going to run over you and kill you. If you're standing in front of that truck that's running at 1 mile an hour, then perhaps you can stop it. Yeah, if you can get that analogy, then that's just the whole quality of the slowing down. Yeah, or the corralling of the mind is we have to slow things down. We don't keep pumping and pumping and pumping and pumping and pumping and keeping the thing going at 100 miles an hour, saying maybe I should stop. Because that's more like a crash. You can't stop at 100 miles an hour. We have to slow things down first. And one of the ways of slowing things down is by having wholesome thoughts. Okay, that slows things down. Another way of thinking about it is corralling the mind, that the mind will go all over the place. It'll just go anywhere. Like a wild horse can get himself into all kinds of trouble by going into a ravine or into a thicket or into a pack of wolves, all kinds of dangerous places. But if we can take that horse and put it into a pasture that has really delicious grass to eat, but it's got a fence, then the horse is going to stay in the pasture and be taken care of quite well. A paradise. We create a paradise for the horse. Then later we can think about putting the horse into a corral, which means now we take the mind and put it into a very small space. But that pasture is actually the pasture of wholesome thoughts. So we're beginning to limit or put boundaries on the mind.

**Speaker C:** Okay, got it.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and this is how we do it. And as we continue to do this, we begin to then not give any value to the old unwholesome thoughts that used to run rampant, and so they become less frequent and then die out. But you don't give a thought to it anymore.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so, when we are able to control the mind, in the beginning, the first thing that we're beginning to do with it is no longer just observe the wild horse out in the countryside, in the dangers, in the thickets, but rather we begin to take the effort to keep the mind into a wholesome state. To bring it back to the wholesome over and over and over again. This is the first training, that every time that your monkey mind jumps out of this wholesome tree to everywhere else, you bring it back and keep it in this wholesome area. That's the way that we start to practice. This is the path of the Buddha, to take the effort to make the mind wholesome. Now, everybody asks the question, "What is wholesome?" And the answer to that is, what is wholesome is a skill to be developed. You could say that it's insight, or it's a discovery process that each person has to find for themselves what is really wholesome for them and what is not. But there are some guidelines. It's basically everybody has their own set of morals, but in the beginning we're given precepts or Sunday school lessons or Ten Commandments or a whole bunch of stuff to get started with, but eventually we figure out what our own morality is going to be. Oftentimes people make a lot of mistakes with that because they've got a lot of greed and ill will built into their morality. The point is, here we have to also now decide in our morality what's wholesome and what's not wholesome. Morality, or the rules, or the way that we were taught, or all of that kind of stuff, greatly influences the mind on a regular basis, like maybe all day long. And so, we can wake up to that. And check it out in the sense of, if it's in the past, if I'm thinking about things that have already happened, then they may be unwholesome, likely to be unwholesome. If I'm thinking about the future, and especially in the sense of how I want it to be, or what work I've got to do, and I can't think of much other reasons to think about the future, then it's probably unwholesome. There are some wholesome things that have to be done in the future, like we have to keep track of passports, or making sure that visas or driver's licenses, that kind of stuff is up to date. But that doesn't take much time. These are very, very little kinds of things. But it's also quite possible for people to get really worried about it. And spend all their time thinking about a passport that needs to be renewed and just wasting their time because they're not actually productive. They're just worried. And we can worry about all kinds of things, wanting something that we don't have. So this waking up, then, this Sati, is to wake up to recognize that right now I'm wanting something I don't have. I want that visa updated, or I want that girl, or I want that car. I want, I want, I want. And that's often what happens when we use this standing up meditation that I just mentioned, is to recognize that the reason we stand up is often because we want something. And so we begin to look at what we want, because what we want then will determine basically whether it's wholesome or not, because often wanting things that we don't have is a whole lot of work to go get it. That's Dukkha. We're dissatisfied. But if what we want is easily had and we can get what we want easily, then there's very little or no Dukkha there at all. So in that regard, we can begin to want the only want things that are easily available. And so that what wisdom then would be is, is now that you know what it is that you want that's easily available, make that stuff easily available in advance. That's wisdom, so that you can see how things are going. You can project off into the future in a wholesome way, and you can see what's going and see what things to avoid. And so the practice then starts with making the thoughts wholesome. So the question then would be, thinking about things that are unwholesome should be known so that we can change them into the wholesome. Here's a way of looking at it. There are some things that we know for sure. Without a doubt, are downright unwholesome. Thoughts of revenge, thoughts of harm, thoughts of doing some damage to someone, thoughts of doing damage to ourselves, ill will, is almost always unwholesome. And then we can say some things are absolutely downright wholesome, no matter how we say it. Like right now is okay, everything is fine, no place to go, nothing to do. 'Everything is okay. This is good.' Those are words that would be wholesome. That leaves a huge amount in the middle someplace. We don't— it's undefined. We don't know quite whether it's wholesome or not. And that's where we need to do the investigation, to keep investigating those things so that we can decide whether this is wholesome or not. So another way of looking at it is that we can look at each of those thoughts in the sense of, can they be improved? I mean, it may or may not be wholesome, but at whatever level it is, that can be improved up to the point of— imagine having a thought that's so pure and so valuable and so wholesome that you could not improve it. In that case, you can congratulate yourself for having such a wildly positive thought, and that does improve it. So always we can congratulate ourselves for the wholesome thoughts that we're having, and we don't have to condemn ourselves for the negative thoughts. We just need to make a change. And so this is the way that we're talking about with the Eightfold Noble Path. Of Sati, to wake up, to be in the here and now, to look at what we're doing. And this is an easy task when we're doing it like getting out of a chair, is to, why am I getting up? Wakey wakey, look at what we're doing. Why am I doing this? And then the next part is, yes, looking, why am I doing this? Is this wholesome or not? That's the investigation, that's the right view or viewing. That when people read Right Noble View, they can't get it as like a viewpoint or a way of looking. But in fact, what we really mean is that it's not a noun, it's a verb. It's the actual act of looking at what we're doing, watching, asking those kinds of questions like, why did I get up? Is this thought whole truth? Those are the kind of investigations to be done. And then, we can make a change. Like with that standing meditation, one of the changes that we can make is put a smile on our faces: "Yes, I'm going to go help someone." Or, we can make the change of sitting back down: "Well, I really don't have to go anywhere after all." And so, we start making these changes to make things more wholesome. And as we do, we begin to build up the wholesome, more and more and more wholesome things, as opposed to having just a recent pile of unwholesome thoughts. And when we begin to do that, we begin to feel good about ourselves, especially if the wholesome thoughts that we're having about, oh, everything is okay, everything is safe, everything is fine, no worries. Then we can begin to come out of our fears, that it's really okay, whatever happens is all right, everything is okay, nothing is amiss, and then we can begin to feel safe and secure. Also, when we were in that chair, more than likely we were comfortable. So why am I getting out of the chair and putting the body in a state of having to stand up? Because that may be a bit uncomfortable, that it's actually easier just to sit back down and take it easy. So when we do this over and over and over again, bringing the mind into the wholesome, bringing the mind back to this present moment, then we begin to get the attitude that I can do this. I actually can talk myself into feeling good. I can become satisfied, and this becomes now the fourth item on the Eightfold Noble Path, which is Samma Sanghappa, and it has to do with right attitude. The right attitude of a winner, the right attitude of can-do, that in the time of the Buddha, They didn't do it this way. This is actually the way that the Buddha designed it, in the sense of that we've got to come to a state of satisfaction, we've got to come to a state of feeling safe and secure and comfortable. That this is what his whole teaching is about, is Dukkha, Anicca, Nirodha. Find out where your dissatisfactions are. When you stood up, you were probably dissatisfied. What were you dissatisfied about? So that we can keep always coming back to the state of being satisfied. Be satisfied over and over again. And when we can control the mind so that we can control it into a state of satisfaction, that's a win. We begin to feel really powerful. We can do it. We can control our mind. And when we come to the point that no matter what happens, I can in fact remove these hindrances and come back into a pleasant state, then that's when that Samma Sanghappa is fulfilled and we actually do take on "I can do this," the champion. You can become a winner. Can do. No matter what happens, I can do this. So that can-do attitude, that winner's attitude, is actually what the Buddha talks about as the first step of the Noble Path. Until then, everybody is ordinary. He says that this is the first Noble Step, is the knowledge and the competence that we can change the mind, no matter what happens, we can change it. And that that knowledge is the first knowledge that is noble. It is super mundane. It is not a factor of the path, and most importantly, it's not held by ordinary people. In fact, you don't have that feeling now, but you can gain that. You can have that confidence that you can in fact handle anything, and that will put you on the actual road to the Noble Path of the Buddha. Most people are victims. We start— everybody starts out as a victim. Everybody, every child starts off in magical thinking. The noble change is when we change the attitude of 'I need help' into 'Gosh, I've got this wired. I can do this all by myself. I don't need any help at all.' That we feel safe and secure knowing that we've got it. And how do we do that again? Well, we start with starting to watch these thoughts. Start pegging on, is this wholesome? Well, yes, Jason, there is a second step, but having greed for the second step is not going to get you to the second step. Satisfaction with the step that you're on is what it's really all about. That will deepen, but we have to go to this step first. And if you say, okay, I'm at the first step, what's the second step? That's a pure indication you're not at the first step. You're just wanting numbers. What's the fourth step? What's the ninth step? And in fact, I remember one time when I was in college, I was reading a math book I bought a book to take the course, and while I was waiting for the course to take, I was reading the book. And by the third chapter, I was lost, confused, full of doubt, didn't know what I was doing. You know why? Because I wasn't doing the examples at the end of the chapter. If I had done the examples at the end of the chapter, in fact, if I'd put some skin in the game, if I'd actually done the work, then I would be ready for Chapter 3. But if I was doing the examples at the end of Chapter 1 while I had Chapter 3 on the mind, I probably wouldn't have been able to do those examples well. So this is the problem with the Western mentality, is that we're always greedy for what comes next, living off into the future. And so when you catch yourself wanting, what's the second step? Where do we go from here? What's next? That indication that you're not even at the first step yet. The first step is to become comfortable at the first step, become happy at the first step, satisfied. This is good enough. That in fact, the Buddha does say that this first step, this first Jhana, is the path to enlightenment. And the knowledge that I can become satisfied and get the mind out of the hindrances and put into a happy state anytime I want to is the first step of Srotapanna. That's because we've actually been able to develop the first Jhana at least enough that we're going someplace. But if I start thinking, "Oh, what's next after this?" then that's just another a, let us say, form of falling on my face, because I don't have that satisfaction anymore. I have doubts that I don't have it. It's not good enough. I want the second thing and the third thing and the fourth thing. This is normal human greed, and this is what we're trying to come out of in the first place. Actually, this is the first thing we do, is we come out of the greed for what comes next. And become satisfied with what is right here, right now, that this is good enough. And so that's a good question to ask so that it can be pointed out that there is no second. First base is all this game needs. That in fact, if you could say it this way, If you had one guy who was enlightened but he still wanted more and more, and somebody else who was completely satisfied and didn't give a rip about what is enlightenment, which one would you take as a teacher? The one who claims enlightenment and yet is full of greed, or the one who has no greed and he's completely satisfied and he doesn't even want to become enlightened, he's okay already? That in fact it's these labels that have been added to Buddhism. See, they're features or attributes when they're actually in the teaching of the Buddha, but Western Buddhism has turned these into goals, into attainments, into aspirations, rather than saying that it's much more like stepping on the train and enjoying the ride, and let the train take you through the various cities. And what is that train? The train of right here, right now, being satisfied in this present moment, being satisfied. This is good enough, quite pleasant in fact, having a ball here, thank you very much. Well, pranayama and anapanasati are exactly the same thing. And that in the old days, that's what they were doing. They were experimenting with the breathing, prana and anapanasati. Panna and prana are the same thing. There's a lot of Sanskrit that have words that have Rs in it that are not in the Pali, like Dhamma and Dharma and Kamma and Karma and pranayana, or prana and Panna. So anapana and pranayana are just the same words in two different languages backwards, but they're very close languages. And so we're actually practicing yoga. This is a yoga. What the word yoga means, it means work. Well, what do you think right noble effort is? It's doing the right work, the work of changing the mind. So you could think of this as Citta yoga, to get the mind straightened out. So, uh, we use the breathing, learn to control the breathing, because controlling the breath is controlling the mind. You can't control the breath without the mind doing it. The mind's got to control the breath. The mind is the one that's decisional. We can slow the breath down intentionally, and we can remember to slow the breath down intentionally. So we have Sati, That's why the Buddha talks about it in the Anapanasati Sutta. It's translated as mindfulness, but mindfully we breathe in long, mindfully we breathe out long, which means at least during the breath, know what kind of breath this is, and to actually control it into being long. There's also a short breathing, but we don't need to do that. Here, because the long breath is really all we need. There is a short breath, but that's really to wake us up and to focus the mind, but the long breath is what we want to do most of the time. So, watching our breath, in the sense of making it long and easy and gentle, is actually one of the things that we can do to help the body relax, as well as helping the feelings. We can feel more safe and secure when we're doing the long easy breath, especially the out-breath, which is often referred to as a sigh. Now there's many different kinds of sighs: a sigh of relief, a sigh of rejection, a sigh of aspiration, a sigh of frustration. The one that we're looking for is the sigh of relief, the sigh of relaxation, the sigh of letting go. Which is part of yoga, part of breathing out correctly. This purifies the body. And so we mindfully breathe in and mindfully breathe out with the idea of relaxing the body, purifying the body, energizing the body. And we do all of that with the mind too. Then in fact, if the body is becoming energized through the blood, then the mind becomes also energized through having good oxygen flow in the blood. It actually kind of wakes us up. So this is the quality that we want to start practicing when we're sitting, but we can do that kind of stuff when we're standing up, just get out of the chair. This is a good point to introduce the idea of, well, what are we going to do when we sit down in the chair? I mean, why do you sit down in the chair? Do we sit down in the chair to relax, sit down in the chair to take a load off our feet? Right? So, why don't we use that anchor of sitting down in the chair as also the anchor to take a load off our mind? To relax the mind and relax the body, to say, "Wow, it feels really good to sit down. I can take a deep breath and relax." And so you can practice that every time you sit down. Remember, while you're sitting down, to intentionally relax the body, to intentionally relax the mind, to intentionally feel and experience how good the body feels now that you've just set it down. So we're actually doing Anapanasati then every time we sit down and every time we stand up. Investigation and relaxation over and over and over again. And if you can get good at doing that all day long while you're getting up and sitting down out of your chair, that'll bring a whole lot more of that very thing into times between, so that you can begin to put a lot of mind moments into being right here, right now, in this present moment. So this is what I would recommend. To get a handle on all of that stuff with actions. This standing up and sitting down then will help you with, Pedro, with all kinds of actions. Why am I doing this? What's going on here? Okay, okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, beautiful topic and conversation, Dhammarato. Very delighted by this topic and conversation. Thank you so much.

**Speaker A:** I'm glad you liked it. Nor, what's happening, man? What you up to? Good to see you. I'm so happy to see you. I don't think your microphone is working. It doesn't say muted. But I can't hear you. No mic. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Now it should be.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, now I can hear you.

**Speaker C:** Now it's me.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it's been a while since I've seen you.

**Speaker C:** Okay, I'll bring other.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I hear you now.

**Speaker C:** Okay, nice. So I'm also so happy to see you.

**Speaker A:** And the discussion was great. Good to see you. I hope you're well. I hope everything is going well for you in Tunisia.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, oh yeah, everything is fine right now.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, we can follow up on the conversation that you and I had several years ago during the midst of COVID I was telling you that Thailand is not a good time to come, but right now is. Everything has been changed. Changed because the COVID restrictions. Flights are available, easy come, easy go. So if you are reconsidering coming, then exactly that, right now is the time.

**Speaker C:** I heard that there are some like terrorist actions that happened in southern Thailand?

**Speaker A:** Well, I don't know all of the news, but I do know that several laws have been changed to make both the visas easier and other laws that make Thailand even more appealing than before. And so right now we're so swamped on this island that all— that only expensive places are for rent. That everything else has been taken up. We're full. That's amazing. 2 years ago, people, places were going out of business left, right, and center because of no tourism. And right now they're booked up solid. So that's the big change. Everything is open now. And just today, 3 students came out of the retreat with Dhamma Vitu over at Deepa Bhavana just today. Laurent and Daniel and David, all 3 were in the same retreat together. Now I think that's quite amazing.

**Speaker C:** I'll check it out. I wanted to go to retreat with Arahant Anicca. He's in the United States and he's doing no retreats in the United States, I think because of COVID But he was going to France and he's going to retreat. But then I could not go because I could not find an appointment. And yeah, whenever I want to do a retreat or something, something happens all the time.

**Speaker A:** So, okay, well, now you can reconsider, um, here that in fact, as I remember when I was with, uh, Ajahn Thanissaro way back when, 20 years more than that, um, he was not doing retreats. And I know that they've got more, more monks now, and I don't think that that was set up to do retreats. They do have Western practitioners come and stay. But I think Ajahn Thanressaro are very much like myself, that we need a different kind of retreat. The way that they're set up in the West is not necessarily that useful. So anyway, Thailand, it's good to come to get into it. Through the retreats. But then there are a lot of different wats and a lot of different places to stay. There's really a lot of stuff to do here, Buddha sasana-wise, with wat suwan mokk. I mean, I've got students now living in the big temples in Bangkok. I've got students in Roy Yat, monks. And so, um, uh, if you want to go visit those, watch. I've got friends for you to meet you at the door.

**Speaker C:** Okay, well, uh, I think that's gonna be it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Um, I'll check Thailand, definitely, since there are the restrictions of COVID Basically, that's why I could not come back then.

**Speaker A:** I know. So maybe if you've been wise, you've been saving all of your lira or whatever currency they have in that country, and you're ready to come. And I'm really happy to see you again. I've been waiting to talk to you to tell you that things have gotten open now because I know how much you were thinking about coming before.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, I definitely want to like to visit real temple and visit the real thing.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, call me for the details and we'll figure it out. All right.

**Speaker C:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I'm really glad to see you again, guys. This has been a nice talk. Pedro, do you have anything to say as we finish up?

**Speaker B:** No. Okay, just, uh, I renew my excitement for this, this course and this group. Thank you also for the new friends that join so that we can meet and maybe have conversation on the chat. And so thank you again, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** I very much encourage you to come on to the chats on UK Sangha or on the US Sangha and chat with each other, have videos, do as you please. But make friends. We all need more friends. Okay, I feel wealthy with friends, and it's still good to have more new ones. All right, Jason, see you later too. Do you have any final things to say? Let— why don't you call and ask that question later when you get your microphones Straightened out. Good, excellent. Okay guys, thank you for this call. I really enjoyed it. Good to have some brand new students and some really, really old ones this time. Good one. Okay guys, bye-bye.

**Speaker C:** Bye.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key teachings and discussion points:

### **Core Theme: Practical Mindfulness & The First Step of the Path**
The talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A), focuses on moving mindfulness from a passive observation to an active, wholesome training of the mind, grounded in the present moment and everyday actions.

### **Main Teachings:**

1.  **Right Mindfulness (Sati) is Waking Up:** True mindfulness is not just being aware of pain or distraction, but actively waking up from daydreams and unwholesome thoughts (like reliving an argument) to the sensory reality of the present moment.

2.  **The Breath as an Anchor & Tool:** The breath is a primary anchor because it's always present. The practice involves not just returning to it, but **seizing control** of it—making it long, easy, and gentle—to calm the body and mind. This is linked to *anapanasati* and *pranayama*.

3.  **Cultivating Wholesome Thoughts:** The goal is to actively replace unwholesome thoughts (ill will, greed, worry) with wholesome ones (e.g., "I'm safe now," "Everything is okay"). This is "Right Effort." The mind is like a wild horse; first, corral it into the "pasture" of wholesome thoughts.

4.  **The "Standing Up" Meditation - A Practical Exercise:**
    *   Use daily actions—like standing up from a chair or opening a door—as "anchors" to wake up.
    *   **Pause and investigate:** Ask, "Why am I doing this? Where am I going? Is this wholesome?" This combines **Sati (mindfulness)** and **Right View/Investigation**.
    *   This practice trains you to interrupt automatic, often desire-driven ("I want...") behavior and choose wholesome action or non-action.

5.  **The Paramount Importance of Satisfaction (The First Step):**
    *   The crucial first step on the path is developing the **confident ability to make the mind satisfied, happy, and free from hindrances *right here, right now***.
    *   This creates a "can-do," winner's attitude (*Samma Sankappa*). Greedily asking "What's the next step?" is a sign one hasn't truly mastered this first step of contentment.
    *   This knowledge and ability is what separates an "ordinary person" from one entering the noble path (*Sotapanna*).

6.  **Slowing Down to Stop:** Using the analogy of stopping a truck, you must first slow it down. Similarly, you calm the mind through wholesome thoughts before you can fully stop unwholesome patterns.

7.  **Judging Wholesomeness:** Some things are clearly unwholesome (revenge, harm). Some are clearly wholesome (peace, safety). A large middle area requires investigation. The guideline: Can this thought/action be improved? Is it leading to satisfaction or dissatisfaction (*Dukkha*)?

### **Key Dialogue Highlights:**
*   **Speaker B (Pedro)** asked about the relationship between good action, bad action, and the "ending of action." Dhammarato clarified that the "ending of action" comes from first slowing and corralling the mind with wholesome thoughts.
*   The discussion expanded to include personal catch-ups, with **Speaker C (Nor)** inquiring about visiting Thailand for retreats now that COVID restrictions have eased.

### **Overall Message:**
The path begins with training the mind in the present moment through simple, relentless daily practice. By using mundane activities as meditation triggers, one cultivates the skill of waking up, investigating intention, and choosing wholesome thoughts that lead to satisfaction. This foundational confidence and contentment is itself the essential first achievement on the path to enlightenment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by Speaker A (Dhammarato) to explain mindfulness and meditation practice:

### **Metaphors:**

1. **Roadblocks / Traffic Barriers:**  
   - Used to describe how to stop unwholesome thoughts or actions. Just as police set up barriers to stop traffic, we can set up mental barriers to stop harmful thoughts from leading to action.

2. **Wild Horse / Corralling the Mind:**  
   - The mind is compared to a wild horse that roams into dangerous places (ravines, thickets, wolves). The practice involves first leading it into a safe, fenced pasture (wholesome thoughts), and later into a smaller corral (focused attention).

3. **Truck at High Speed vs. Slow Speed:**  
   - Stopping the mind is like stopping a truck: if it’s going 100 mph, you can’t stop it without a crash. You must first slow it down (through wholesome thoughts) before you can bring it to a stop.

4. **Monkey Mind in a Tree:**  
   - The restless mind is like a monkey jumping from branch to branch. Training involves gently bringing it back to the “wholesome tree” each time it jumps away.

5. **Hunter-Gatherer Mentality:**  
   - Applied to daily activities like shopping: “hunter” mode is having a list and seeking specific items; “gatherer” mode is browsing aimlessly. This illustrates intentional vs. impulsive behavior.

6. **Train Journey:**  
   - The path of practice is compared to boarding a train and enjoying the ride through various cities, rather than anxiously focusing on the destination. Emphasizes being present and satisfied rather than greedy for “next steps.”

7. **Math Textbook Example:**  
   - Trying to skip ahead in practice is like reading a math book but skipping the exercises at the end of each chapter. You’ll get lost because you haven’t mastered the basics. Highlights the importance of contentment with the current step.

8. **Breath as a Sigh of Relief:**  
   - The out-breath is compared to a sigh of relief or letting go—a key part of relaxing the body and mind during meditation.

### **Stories / Anecdotes:**

1. **Arguing with Judy:**  
   - A recurring example of how during meditation, thoughts of a past argument can arise, and if not mindfully addressed, can lead to actually getting up and restarting the argument. Used to illustrate how mindfulness can help recognize and change unwholesome thought patterns.

2. **Standing Up from a Chair / Opening a Door:**  
   - A practical “standing meditation” story: every time you stand up from a chair or open a door, pause and ask, “Why am I doing this? Is it wholesome?” This story is used to show how to bring mindfulness into daily life and interrupt automatic, often desire-driven, actions.

3. **Student Forgetting to Pause After Standing:**  
   - A story about students beginning this practice and remembering only after taking 5–20 steps. The instruction is not to go back, but to stop at that moment and reflect. This normalizes the learning process and emphasizes gentle persistence.

4. **Choosing a Teacher: Enlightened but Greedy vs. Satisfied but Not “Enlightened”:**  
   - A hypothetical scenario to challenge the listener’s values: Would you prefer a teacher who claims enlightenment but is greedy, or one who is completely satisfied and free from greed but doesn’t care about the label? This story critiques goal-oriented spirituality and praises contentment.

5. **Personal College Memory with a Math Book:**  
   - Speaker shares a personal story of trying to read ahead in a math textbook and becoming confused because he skipped the exercises. This directly parallels the mistake of being greedy for “the next step” in meditation instead of mastering and being satisfied with the current one.

These metaphors and stories collectively serve to make abstract meditation concepts (mindfulness, right effort, wholesome vs. unwholesome thoughts, contentment) tangible, relatable, and practical for daily life.
