### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So I'm turning the video camera on. Be sure to ask questions if you have any questions because this is pretty detailed. Today is Sunday afternoon and, uh, hello Rick, good to see you. Today we've had a question to go over, uh, the topic of Paticcasamuppada again. It's been quite a while since we who talked about it as a whole topic. And that the way to understand overall in general what is Paticcasamuppada is that it is an expanded version of the Second Noble Truth. That in fact, the Second Noble Truth is the feelings of liking and not liking and ignorance as it's defined. And in Paticcasamuppada, the whole sequence starts with ignorance, winds up with Dukkha, and has those feelings right in the middle of liking and not liking, and in the context of Paticcasamuppada, the feeling of confusion. Now, altogether there are 12 items in the list of Paticcasamuppada, and that is more or less chronological in order. And I want to make sure that you understand that it's more or less in order. In fact, you can think about it in the fact that you're in a car driving from one city to another, but along the way you'll make detours, you'll turn around and go back. Maybe you're looking for some gas station or whatever like that. And so you do a little bit of looping around and then you'll go a little bit further and doing more looping around. And so if you understand it that way, you'll be better off than understanding it's just 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, up to 12. It's not like that at all. There's quite a lot of looping around that's in there. So it starts with ignorance, and we can say that it starts kind of with ultimate ignorance. In the sense that when a child is born, that's the one thing about him. He's human, but he's a really ignorant human, doesn't know how to feed himself, doesn't know how to dress himself, doesn't know the language of his parents or any other language. For that reason, it doesn't know anything. And so that's just kind of a raw ignorance. And As we grow up, we pick up a lot of stuff along the way of growing up, and almost always what we pick up is picked up ignorantly. In other words, we don't have any discernment. Now, the first word ignorance, actually the Pali word for it is ajiva. And in this case, it can be translated as 'not knowing.' We don't know anything. And so, the second part of it, of picking stuff up without knowledge, is called Samskara. Now, Samskara can be thought of as just a big pile of stuff. Let us say that you walk into a room, And there's a great big pile of books, a big pile of books. Some of them are open, some of them are closed, some of them are stacked on top of each other. But normally it's kind of a just big pyramid. It's kind of hard to find things in there. And if in fact, if you go looking for something, you're likely, more likely to pick up another book that's all of a sudden interesting and you'll go do that. Instead of what you intended, okay? And that winds up being our memory system. And so you can think of it as a compound collection that's completely disorganized because it was built up disorganized through ignorance, okay? Now, if we can understand those two points of Paticcasamuppada we can recognize that we keep looping back into that, especially looping back into ignorance and Samskara, that in fact, all learning experience that happens throughout life can be equated to just more and more pile of junk, of literature, of everything, except that it can be Let us say, it might be possible to be well protected, but generally it's not, which means that it's subject to rot, subject to decay, subject to getting burned. And in the real world, we can say that sometimes we forget things, and then later we'll remember them. Sometimes we forget things and we forget them for good. Some things we thought we know, but we didn't know at all. Some of the memories that we put in place, in fact, didn't ever happen. They were delusions to begin with. And so this big pile of stuff you could think of then— now you've probably heard me and other places say that everyone is an emperor of their own pile of dirt. All right, the Pali word for this pile of dirt is Samskara. They're stored in the body, they're stored in emotions, they're stored in verbal, they're stored in these three primary ways. We store them in visualization We store, for instance, music and poetry as verbal, but musically verbal, but we also store all of our supposed-tos, all of our rights, rules, rituals, laws, ways to live, ideals, etc., like that. This is all the kind of stuff conceptualized thinking then is based upon. Just digging up some Samskara, maybe take— by taking 3 or 4 books out of the pile of books and taking a page out of one book and a page out of another book and roll them together, and now we've got a new thing going. All right, this is how we invent and create concepts. So the Samskara then, um, Let me give you an example of a physical Samskara, that in the body, some people learn to play baseball and some people don't. That in fact, one of the humorous things that I keep seeing in Thailand over and over again is that throwing, like throwing a ball, to Thai people, they intellectually see the ball as a weapon, And so they never learned to catch, they never learned to throw. Well, if you were in America in the 1950s and '60s, baseball was all the rage, and so every kid learned to throw and to catch in one way or another. And so in Thailand, for instance, if two people are in the same room, across the room from each other, and one wants to hand the car keys to the other, either one or both of them has to get up and cross the room to hand the keys. Now in America, you just toss those keys over to the guy and he'd catch them. If you toss keys over to a Thai person, they'll hit him, hit him in the chest or whatever like that. He's not going to make any movements at all to catch the keys. All right, why then does that happen? Is because we built up the habit, we built up the memory base, and so being able to catch keys flying through the air is a Samskara, a bodily Samskara. The same thing would be with learning how to play music. That would be a physical Samskara. All right, this is kind of important because in Western Buddhism there seems to be a lot of confusion about what is the Samskara. Well, it's basically everything you already know. You know how to put your pants on. Sometimes you put your pants on and you wind up they're on backwards because you weren't looking at what you were doing, you just put your pants on. All right, because you knew how to do that. It's not instinctive, it's learned behavior. Instinctively, you'd never wear pants. And so it's not an instinct, it's learned behavior. Learned, uh, learned how to do things. Learn how to twiddle your thumbs, learn how to hold a pen. Learn how to write, learn calligraphy, whatever like that. Also sewing, knitting, any of those kinds of activities would be physical Sankhara that we have learned over time. The same thing then with the verbal Sankharas. And also, the Citta Sankhara is— we have to define a word here. Citta or Citta is normally thought of as just mind, but in fact the Buddha talks about mind in two different ways, and when you add verbal Sankhara, that's the third kind. In fact, you could think of the Citta is actually the child ego state, and that verbal Sankhara would be the parent ego state. And then the adult in the Pali would be called Manut. Look at the word man in there. All right, a Manut is someone who is grown up, who can see, and that would be considered the adult, but the Citta, that's the child ego-state, that's where all of our feelings and emotions are, rather than the adult ego-state. So it's not all of the mind, when we think of mind in the English language, we actually think of it as a conglomerate of things, as opposed to the way that we're thinking about it is, is that Most of the feelings that you have are learned. You learned how to be angry from your dad. You learned how to cry from your mom. You learned a lot of stuff that we don't even know how much stuff we've learned and picked up from other people. But basically, we picked it up when we were really young and really ignorant. And so most of the habits that we have of feelings like getting our feelings hurt. That's funny, because getting your feelings hurt— some people, there's one kind of collection of getting your feelings hurt that everybody has, and then there's other kinds of getting your feelings hurt that only a few people have. And then there's a third kind of feeling of getting your feelings hurt that the first two kinds don't have, but you have So there's various different ways of feeling. Now generally the feelings are in two major parts, and we'll get into that later, but I'll introduce it in this sense of mind, is that normally the Citta is dealing with fear. All of our bad feelings are based in fear. Let me give you a little list. Anger, frustration, anxiety, stress, grief, ill will, hate—all of those are based in fear. And then you will have the kind of feelings that are not based in fear, which would be joy, happiness, satisfaction, uh, feeling of safe, secure, etc. Like that. All of these are based in the Citta or the Citta. So the Citta Sankhara then is our beaming system. Now a lot of people say, well, that's actually just a small part of me, that most of my, uh, Samskaras are either bodily or the parent ego-state, the verbal Sankharas. But basically, what we can really understand is that there's a relationship between these Sankharas, and when we put them into action—and we'll talk about that later—they will interfere with each other. And who you are is a, let us say, a dance generally, of your Sankaras. So now that we've got those two basics down, let's start in this present moment, you can think of the Sankaras. Anytime that you have a Sankara, even if you Learned it just 3 minutes ago or yesterday, right now it's in the past. So we're going to go from the past now into the next section of Petitja Samuppada, which is the present moment. And the present moment, we use it in the sense of our senses, that we take in sensory input, and that sensory input is normally things we see, things we hear, things we touch, taste, smell, the five senses, plus the additional sense of the mind, which now gets into cycling things around. Because what can we sense with the mind is our old Samskara, but in the present moment rather than as a storage, that we bring it out of storage right here, right now. And so this, by the way, is referred to as consciousness Consciousness is actually the ability to receive input. And so consciousness, the Pali word for it is Pañña, and that consciousness then is raw, it's just merely input. Even if I look at a tree, that raw input does not come up with a tree, it just is an image that I see with my eyes. I now have to dig into the Paticcasamuppada's Samskara base to look for trees in my pile of junk, and I'll come up with a tree. And then I'll match this tree with that tree until I recognize this tree is this tree, because I've seen it before. It's right here in my yard. Now the joke is, or the test is, is that right now when I use the word tree, you hear the word tree, you have all probably gotten the mental image of a tree. Ben, did you pick up a mental image of a tree?

**Speaker B:** Yes, various trees came up.

**Speaker A:** Various trees. As I talked to trees, every time I use the word tree, a different tree would come up, right? All of these trees are in your Samskara. How about you, Emre? Did the same thing happen with you?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, definitely.

**Speaker A:** I saw some green. Rick, how about you? Did you see various mental images of trees when I started talking about trees? Okay, so everybody does that. You come up with a tree that's in your memory bank, and I bet that the various trees that you came up with don't agree. That what Rick saw and what Amrit saw is different than what Ben saw. All right, that in fact, when I'm talking about a tree, I'm talking about a pan palm, and I use that in particular because I've only seen a couple of them. I've got two of them here in my yard. The other place that I've ever seen a pan palm like this Anagami was in a botanical garden in Sri Lanka. So I'm pretty sure that you didn't come up with a fan palm when talking about a tree. It depends upon the kind of trees generally that you have around. Rick would be the only possible one, maybe Ivan, because they're here in Asia. Rick, what kind of trees did you come up with? Actually, I got a tree from my childhood. There's like two trees in the garden.

**Speaker D:** And I just pictured those trees.

**Speaker A:** Something old. Something old, yeah. Okay, now when we use the word come up with, that's the next step of Paticcasamuppada. In the Pali language, for Paticcasamuppada specifically, it's called nama-rupa. And what we mean by that is, rupa is something real, a real tree, or the word tree, and that we then name it, or take a picture of it. So there is reality, and then there is what we come up with, and that what we came up with then is the internal representation of what the external was. In this sense, I use the word tree as an audio, and yet you came up with an image of a tree. Right? Okay. And this coming up with is called— or what you do come up with is called salyattana. Salyattana actually means the internal sense. The external was the word tree. The internal is an image of a tree which may or may not have anything to do with what I'm talking about when I use the word 'tree.' And the process of coming up with is that nama-rupa, which is thumbing through your various pile of Samskara to come up with that image. So the nama-rupa is actually a process And so we go from consciousness to making shit up to the shit that we make up. You got that so far? Okay, so we, based on ignorance, Anagami, we go through Samskara building stuff up over a long period of time. Then we hear a word tree, we look into the Samskara to try to come up with trees. Some of you come up with several different trees. And that process of coming up with is called the nama-rupa. There's also another word in the Pali that's used for this, it's called Vinaya. And then we come up with this thing, the tree that you came up with, the image you came up with, if it's more complicated we can call it a concept, or let us use it as the term story. So we hear something, we make up a story. That's the Anagami, the Sankhara, the Sannyha, the Namarupa, and the Savyatana. Guess what? We've already covered now 5 of the 12. All right, but we have to remember that this nama rupa, that's the big pony in the stable, because that's what we make up is what impacts us. What we actually see or hear— when I use the word tree, that's not what you came up with. You came up with your own tree. And the tree that you came up with is what impacts us. In fact, reality doesn't impact us, it's our story about reality. Because this gets really complicated. When somebody's telling you a story, the story that they tell you is not the story that you hear. You make the story up as it goes along. And the story that you come up with is that which impacts you. All right, so upon the impact— by the way, the Pali word for it is passa. And now we are halfway through. This is all automatic in the sense that this whole sequence from the consciousness to the Namarupa to the Salyatana, into the Paśa, can take a split second. It takes only a split second, let us say something like less than a tenth of a second, maybe even half a tenth of a second. And I'll stop here for just a moment to bring a concept in. Have you ever heard of tests of reaction times. The first one that I ever saw was a little machine that judged how good a driver you were based upon your reaction time of when the light goes on, you push the button. Now they have websites that test your reaction time, and most ordinary people are about 350 milliseconds down to maybe 250 milliseconds. If you have been practicing something like becoming a baseball catcher, where you have to watch very quickly, many sports people, another place that would have like a black belt in karate, his reaction time will be down to about 200. 200 milliseconds. Okay, now the reaction has two processes. One we see, and the second one we act. So that means that we had two thought moments, and in Paticcasamuppada we're talking about so far these first six is the first part of the reaction time, that of being able to observe. Now, further, some Olympic champions have been measured with the reaction time down to about 180, but that's about the best. That's the human limit, is about 180. However, cats can get it down to about 65, 64 milliseconds. That's their reaction time. Well, they don't have to make up a lot of stuff. And so they're making up— there's not much to it. And so they can go right into the reaction after they've seen it. So on the web, by the way, the reaction time systems will give you like a red screen, and as soon as that screen turns green, you click the mouse. And then they'll measure the time that it took from the time that the screen turned red to green, and when your mouse click was, and they measure that, and that's about 200 milliseconds if you're very fast, 180 if you're world champion, 65 if you're a cat, but cats don't even know how to take this test. All right, so now let's go into the second half, the reaction time. And that is starting with Vinaya, our feelings. In other words, once something contacts us, once we see the green screen show up, turns from red to green, then we can react. Well, in the reaction time transmittal, all we have to do is click the mouse. But many people will click the mouse nervously. Some will click it joyfully. In fact, part of the reason why there's slow mouse clicking is because there's got an element of feeling in it, rather than no feeling at all, they just react. But in fact, that's one of the things that is taught in sports. An example would be a race car driver, let's say Formula One race car drivers. And here he is barreling down through there in that race, running at close to 200 miles an hour or so, and some little old lady steps out on the racetrack. If he has the thought, "Old lady, you should not be here," he just killed her. He's got to be able to react without thinking about it. That in fact, his— when he saw her, he had thoughts about her, making up a story about her which killed her. He needs, instead of making up a story about her not being on there, he needs to be able to maneuver his automobile with the whatever, mostly the steering, to avoid her, to get out of the way. Okay, that's part of the reason why cats are faster than humans, is because we put extra processing in there that we don't need to do. That's why a cat can jump out of a snake's path and a human gets bit watching the snake bite him. His reaction time is just too slow, like, "Oh no, there's a snake here, oh, I'm afraid, oh, I might get bit." While he's thinking about, "Oh, I might get bit," he gets bit. Okay, so we have these feelings that come up. Now, the feelings, according to the teaching of Paticcasamuppada, there's three kinds of feelings. Well, guess what? We can say then that the Second Noble Truth, the cause of Dukkha, are these three kinds of feelings. Hello, Martin. Doing Paticcasamuppada today. We've just covered the first half of it. So, as we are impacted by whatever story that we tell, whatever that we Uh, in other words, we don't react directly to what we see. It has to go through this process of making up a story. It's the story then is impacting us. Go ahead, you said something, Martin? Never mind. Oh, sorry, Dhammarato. Sorry, I didn't realize my mic was unmuted.

**Speaker D:** Sorry for that.

**Speaker A:** Okay, let me continue on. All right, the second noble truth is Moha Lobhadossa, the causes of Dukkha, our cause of dissatisfaction. Is our feelings. And we can have ignorant feelings, we can have feelings of wanting, and we can have ignorant feelings of not wanting or wanting to get away from, and then we can have a third kind of feeling of, "I'm not sure whether I like it or I want it or not." These three kinds of feelings then, may in fact start circling around back to, well, let's do some more processing, go back into the nama rupa, grab some more garbage out of our past, and come up with a slight change to our story, which impacts us, which gives us a new feeling. Now, if the feelings that we have— and by the way, that sequence that I just mentioned is more likely to happen with a Dhamma dude than it is to an ordinary person. Most people, they make up a story and they go with it. They don't reprocess it. So when we are ignorant in our feelings, if I want something ignorantly, I'm more than likely to go right into— I want it. If I like it, I want it. If I want it and want it, I'm going to really want it. This is the grasping and clinging. So the feelings themselves are Vedana, leading to Tanha, and the word Tanha is actually thirst, which in English we would use the word wanting. And then Upadana, is the clinging, that I've got to have it. All right, so this, in the— this process of going from I like it to I want it to I've got to have it has a process that's parallel to that, that that's the beginning of the self, that we invent a self or a selfishness And that is called Bhavana. And then, when the self becomes full-blown, that's called Atta. And actually, the word that's used normally is birth, Jati. And Jati in Nepali does not ever, ever translate to rebirth. It translates to just the word birth, the birth of the self, and is then that self that we have that actually does the suffering. When you suffer, who suffers, Rick? Me, that's who suffers. If you don't have a self, there's nothing to suffer. And so this is why the Buddha was fairly big on Anatta. In fact, you've probably heard of the Trilokana, I think it is called, the three characteristics of Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta. You heard that? Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta. And in fact, the Mahasi group are very big on this without completely really understanding what's going on. So let's look at it in the sense of a road that you're going down and it has a fork or a T. And so the road that you're going down is just a road, but now the road changes into a Y and you can either go one direction or the other. If you take one road, which is the road of Anatta, then there's no self, I'm not there. It changed, so what? But the other fork in the road is the Dukkha, and the Dukkha is because there is a self. In other words, if the change, if the fork in the road leads you to 'I don't know and I don't care,' then everything is good. But if it leads to 'I like it, I want it,' then that's going to lead to the Dukkha. Because there's a self that is born. Now, when we talk about Paticcasamuppada, the problem is that language, we have to give it in a particular order. But if you can understand the fact that When we have Bhavana, Bhavana is coinciding with the grasping and the clinging, and then the Jati, the birth, is coinciding also. Here's an example of that: if I have this object and I go and cling to it, look at the arm that's there. So it's not just the clinging, there's a clinger, there is the one who clings. And so this is the simultaneous creation, is that as we cling, we create a self that's clinging. When there is no self, there is no clinging. They come together like that. And it's that action of clinging that gives us the Dukkha. So that's basically how the whole thing goes. Now we can interrupt that, and when I say interrupt, I'm saying wisdom can be brought in. We can bring in wisdom at any point in time. Normally it is brought in very, very late. An example of it being very late is that the husband and wife are having a big argument and then the husband walks out of the room and slams the door. That means that they were both in Dukkha for a while, but he eventually woke up to, this is too much, this has gone too far, and he walks out. He ends it, but he's already been stuck in it. Okay, so we can also stop it at the point of the grasping and the clinging. Now, I would like to make an additional point here, that when we want something, when we are clinging to something, there's a process that goes on, and that process has to do something like this. If I like it, I want it. If I want it, that means that it would be good to get it. That means then that I would be better off if I had it. Okay, do you see the creation of the self in that I would be better if I had it? We can also say that if I don't like something, I don't want it, I want to get rid of it, then that means that I would kind of be better off without it. Again, the self is being created there, and always ignorantly. And so, if we can recognize that, in fact, the little story is that Achan Samadhi, before he was an Achan, was with Achan Chah at a ceremony. The ceremony, by the way, is called Khaten, and that's one of the ceremonies when all the young ladies will dress up in their finest. It's all what's available. I mean, they don't wear miniskirts. They're covered up, but they make themselves as beautiful as they possibly can. They're out, in fact, husband shopping. Or maybe they're there all gussied up to meet the husband that the mother has already picked out. And why is that there? Is because normally when a monk is ordaining temporarily, like for 3 months or 2 years or whatever, the tradition is, is that he will disrobe after the ceremony. Right, okay, that sets up the cultural situation. So now Ajahn Sumedho and Ajahn Chah are there at the kathen ceremony, and Ajahn Chah lappingly nudges Ajahn Sumedho and says, "Well, what about this? What do you think?" And Ajahn Sumedho, already knowing Piti, Samma, Pada, said the following: I like it, but I don't want it. Okay, so this is a place where you can actually bring in wisdom. Do you— if you like it, can you leave it at merely liking? Can you see that pretty girl with her major paint job, paint made by Max Factor and, uh, L'Oréal and all of that, and she paints her face up And by the way, what you see is not what you get. What you see is a paint job. There's a girl under there someplace, but she doesn't want to see that. She wants you to see the paint job. And she identifies, I am the paint job. And you will identify, she is the paint job. In fact, no, that's just the paint job. If you can see, I like that paint job, but I don't want the girl that's wearing that paint job. That's wisdom. That's the wisdom. Can you bring wisdom in? Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about it, wisdom at the point of contact. If you can bring wisdom in at the point of contact, that means that you can manage your feelings so that you can control that feeling process so that it does not go from I like it, I want it. Oh, I gotta have her. I start thinking about her. She's gone now. She's gone to meet her new husband, and I'm still thinking about her. That reminds me of the Zen story that we've heard, that the monastery is on the river and the monks go across the river to go on bende-bad. And these two monks had gone to bende-bad And when they came back to cross back over the river to go to the wat, there's an old woman standing at the river, concerned and afraid to cross that river because she hadn't done it before. So the senior monk picks her up on his back and takes her across the river while the younger monk is watching this go on. And when the monk gets her across the river, he sets her down. And proceeds to the what? And the young monk says, "You touched a woman, you carried across a woman, you carried across the river." And the elderly monk said what? What did he say? "I have set her down and you're still carrying her." All right, you're the one who wants her, you're the one who's still carrying her. Me, I don't want her, I set her down. So this is the way that we have to recognize the way that Paticcasamuppada works. Now, uh, one point that I would like to make is, is that there are, um, the four woeful states. These four woeful states are called hell, The woeful state of being a dumb animal. The woeful state of— well, let's see, I know the fourth one is fear, and the third one I've forgotten. Does anybody remember what the four woeful states are? All right, well Basically, the Four Woeful States have to do with what kind of self is being born. If we get angry, if we're wanting, grasping, and clinging, and we get angry, that means that we're being reborn in a hell state. The second kind is called 'frita,' wanting something. When you want something that you don't have,— then this is referred to as a Hungry Ghost. A Hungry Ghost has got the analogy, it looks kind of like a balloon, but imagine a pot that's got a very, very small opening at the top. So the pot has got a great big inner connection, a great big belly, but you can't fill that pot up very quickly because the hole is very small. So this means that the pot still wants something even though it's getting what it wants. It's not getting it fast enough, not getting the quantity that it wants. And this is called the hungry ghost. We remain hungry even while we're eating. I think everybody has recognized that you can be given a delicious meal and as you're wanting as you're eating, you still want more. You get a mouthful of food and you're stirring and making the next bite, and you shove the second and the third and the fourth bite in while you're still trying to chew the first bite. Okay, this is the preta. Now the next one is the dumb animal. I would go so far as to say that's the American favorite. The American favorite is doing what you're told to do and not getting any reward from it. So the little kid has to learn his ABCs, his 1-2-3s. He doesn't want to learn them, and Mom says, "You've got to learn those ABCs, 1-2-3s." And so he learns them, but he doesn't like it. Kids are taught the way that we do school. They're taught to hate school. How many of you, when you got up, let us say, in the morning, into third grade, "Hot dog, I'm going to go to school again today!" No, we don't want to go to school, right? Well, guess what? That habit there you're developing right then and there carries out through your whole life. So that you don't want to get up and go to work, you don't want to get up and go to church, you don't want to get up and do anything. And when we get to work, we do the work, but we don't like the work. We remain in the state of being a dumb animal most of the time. The rest of the time is normally in the state of wanting something that we don't get enough of, fast enough, And only occasionally do we have, um, the anger of being in hell. Now, what hell really is, if you'll think about it, it means you're trapped. You can't get out of it. To where the hungry ghost, all you have to do is just stop eating, for instance. You can get out of that. You can put the food down. Also, the dumb animal, you can just get up and take a break. Well, I'm glad I don't have to do that program right now. But the hell state has the feeling of being trapped. You can't get out of it. And so, the fourth one is the Asura. And it has a counterpart in the Greek literature of the Titans. You know the story of the Titans? They're heavenly beings, but they're warriors. Well, guess what? They're low-class heavenly beings because they deal with violence, and the only people that they have to fight with are higher gods than they are, which means the Titans are doomed to lose every battle. All right, so the same thing is true with the state of all dressed up for battle but afraid to go to war. It's fear. That's the primary feeling of it, is the feeling of being afraid. And basically, that's at the base of all of them. And all four of these woeful states is the way that we get born, when we take a birth, when we take a self. That self is either an asura, a hell being, a hungry ghost, wanting something that we don't have, or a dumb animal going along to get along, doing what we're told to do, but we're not able to enjoy.

**Speaker B:** It.

**Speaker A:** We don't get the reward that we're looking for. All right, so we can then say that to make sure that you've got the Pali for this second half, It's Vedana that has three kinds of feelings to it, which is either confusion— now confusion almost always rots into not liking. Confusion almost rots, almost always rots into not liking, in the sense of that you're confused about something, so you want to know the answer. You got a question. Now I'm talking about, in fact, while we're practicing, when you're sitting alone, as Ivan has talked about, we're sitting in quiet and we're practicing correctly, and then some question will come to mind. That question actually is the feeling of confusion. I don't know whether to like it or not. I don't know where to go from here. I'm kind of lost. All right, now in our society we have been taught to go get some data, go get some more input, go get some knowledge, go read a book, do something like that. All right, well, that doesn't really solve the problem that in fact people can become scholars, bookworms, they read more and more and more books, but they never get out of that feeling state of being confused. And we have students of the Dharma who come and learn to practice correctly, and they don't want to practice. They want to ask more questions, and so I'll answer their question. And now let's practice. No, I don't want to practice yet. I still have more questions. Well, the correct way of doing it is, never mind, I've got enough information to know that I can look at my mind and see that I've got this confusion and I'm wanting to know something. Let's make a change to that. And just say, "I'm okay without that. I don't need to know that right now. I'm all right." But instead, we will go into basically into that wanting to know and wanting to know, we become a preta again. Why do we do that? Ignorance. We're not looking at how we feel. If we can see how we feel, then we have control over whether or not we're going to break up that cycle. And so, as I said before, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about it as wisdom at the point of contact. If you can see how this story that I've just made up is going to lead me into wanting, let's go back and recycle that, get some new input, and come up with a new story, and that's the way that we learn to control our feelings. Just like in this example of, oh, I've got to know about the nose, and oh, I've got to know about the breathing technique, and oh, I've got to know about this, that, and the other thing. And the answer, of course, is I see that I'm wanting to know something, and I've already got everything I need to know. Let's practice just being happy. And so we start having wholesome thoughts right then and there. Well, you can see that that actually is part of the cycle of Paticcasamuppada. We go back and we find a happy thought and put that happy thought into our mix, into the process, come up with a new story, and the new story is, "I'm okay, I'm fine." And then that means that we now can learn to control our feelings. You don't have to feel confused, you can feel I'm okay even if I don't know, I can be happy not knowing. And so we can see now that while the Paticcasamuppada kind of goes off in one direction, we have possibilities of cycling through and making changes and whatnot like that, so we don't wind up at the end of the game of being in Dukkha. Now I didn't mention it, but I will now, but I have referred to it in the sense of that we We teach Paticcasamuppada in forward order, but we practice it in reverse order. We practice it backwards. Why do we practice it backwards? Because we start off slow, and we wait until the end before we can figure out what's going on. The husband slams the door on the way out. All right, but he never had to get that far. In fact, he could have stopped that argument right when it was starting. He could have agreed with his wife, said, you know, honey, what you just said is marvelous, I really like it. And then there was no argument. But if he'd have seen that before, when the day he met her, we could say, wow, I really like that paint job that you're wearing. Bye-bye. All right, so it depends upon how fast we are, and that the basic place that we work with is at that point of contact. We can remanufacture our story so that we can choose to feel the way that we want to feel. This is marvelous! Think about how world-changing this really is, that you actually have control over the way you feel. You do not have to be feeling the way that you learned how to feel for the whole past part of your life. And then the end of the story is that if we can bring this processing to an end, we can bring the salyatana we can stop doing that because we no longer are making stuff up, then that's the end of feeling. That's where it begins to get to the point of being there's nothing there. I'm not making up any stories about it. I'm just looking, just gathering more data. So in that regard, we can say that really there's two giant steps to the teaching of the Buddha. When we don't have any steps at all, we see the Dukkha actually already in it. And then we begin to practice seeing how things really are at the point of contact. We can see this story. Are we going to let this story ride, or are we going to change our story, change the way we feel, so that you feel good, you feel safe, secure, comfortable, satisfied? You begin to live a life of Sukkha. But then the last stage is stop making stuff up. If you don't make stuff up, you don't have to have any feelings at all. You can just be relaxed and comfortable. All right, so Amrit, did I cover Paticcasamuppada for you well enough?

**Speaker C:** Uh, yes, definitely. It was a bit too dense. I think I will have to watch the video again to get everything in order.

**Speaker A:** Yes, this talk would be worth listening to several times. I did not read a book and pick that up the first time. This story that I've just told you took years to put together to find out exactly what's going on within the mind. And if I had not been shown this by Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and Ajahn Po, I'd have never figured it out from the book. And so I offer you to keep going over and over and over again until you really understand that this sequence of events that you go through, you have a choice about it. You can interrupt it anywhere along the way, and the interrupting process is because you can actually see. This is real wisdom, is being able to actually see what's going on. Pawan, you have your hand up. You're among the planets, you're among the stars. Hello.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, well, Dhammarato, while listening to you, I'm thinking how much of this is also in a way a form of hypnosis, or has he— what is basically the link between hypnosis and Buddha's teaching, because I see now there are— I have studied hypnosis for a little bit when I was younger, and still I was very insecure, so I got into hypnosis to make myself a little bit more confident. And the teacher who was teaching that, he was so good, he could even make ladies, especially women, to have orgasms, just orgasms by him talking with them. So basically changing their emotions, and he could make them happy, and he could even make them to orgasm without touching them. And it was all based on basically changing their emotions by the way he was speaking to them and things like that.

**Speaker A:** I bet he was really motivated to do that.

**Speaker E:** Yes, it was for that. It was not for higher purposes. It was for sexuality.

**Speaker A:** And right. He wasn't trying to teach them how to have, let us say, repetitive happiness. He was just there for the session. All right, but the word hypnosis has got a long history. I actually took a hypnosis training program back in the 1970s, and then when I got to Goenka, I recognized that his guided meditations was nothing but a hypnotic induction. All right, now what is self-hypnosis? Is basically just talking to yourself. Now they say that some people cannot be hypnotized. What that really means is that they're resistant. They just don't want to do it. They'll say they want to do it, but really they don't want to. They don't want to follow the instructions. In a way, I think maybe so. Maybe they don't want to follow the instructions. I mean, if this guy is the one who's doing the instruction, I don't think I want to follow him.

**Speaker B:** Either.

**Speaker A:** So it has to do with the level of trust, but it also has to do with that long, slow talking that gets people relaxed. And they talk about going down, down, down into a deep, comfortable place, okay? Now, there's a kind of thing called stage hypnosis, which is similar to this, but really that's also again for entertainment. There is no lasting advantage or any cure It's not medicine, it's more like liquor, alcohol. However, the techniques of the hypnosis has the quality that you can actually, while you're sitting alone in seclusion, you can begin to talk to yourself that way, slowing things down. Start to look carefully at the thoughts that we're having. And so I would say then, I wouldn't use the word hypnosis in that regard, but there are some similarities, except in this case we're talking about real medicine that has a curative basis to it rather than merely getting drunk. That's that quality of slowing down. So Ben, do you have anything to.

**Speaker C:** Say?

**Speaker B:** No questions, Dhammarato. No, just the— I saw a link, there's a video on YouTube, I think, where you do like an introduction to Anapanasati guided meditation, and part of the meditation is Imagine you're entering a lift and then it's going down, down, down, and then you're in a cave, maybe in an ice cave. And that just links to what you just said about the hypnosis.

**Speaker A:** But you're talking about a video that I did years ago. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so you can see by that video then that there are some skills that were picked up from that Yeah, guided meditations and a hypnotic induction have a whole lot of stuff in common, but the hypnotic induction is more like getting you drunk rather than getting you into a state of, let us say, relaxation. Amrit, you got your hand up.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I have one question about Paticcasamuppada, how to break the links. And one of the practice you mentioned, and actually mentioned it many times, is this thought that I don't know and I don't care.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I don't know, I don't care, and there's no me here. What doesn't know doesn't exist.

**Speaker C:** Yes, so this helps me a lot.

**Speaker A:** Nobody's home, the lights are on but nobody's.

**Speaker D:** Home.

**Speaker C:** Yes, so this is kind of breaking this confusion step, right? So there is a confusion and we don't like it, and then when we have this thought, 'I don't know and I don't care,' so this step is we are out of the confusion, confused mind.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's the way to get out of it, is to tell yourself, "I don't know and I don't care." That "I don't care" is actually quite a relaxation. Wow! I'm not grasping and clinging at knowledge. I don't care. And in fact, the word "care" is probably a better word than "cling." Clinging is not a word that we use in the English language very much. That's something like 19th century language. To cling. What we really are talking about is care. Well, guess what? Doesn't the word care have the quality of carrying, which has also the quality of clinging to? I mean, you strap the backpack on that you're carrying, but the reality is, is that you strapped it on because you're actually clinging to.

**Speaker D:** It.

**Speaker A:** So clinging and caring and carrying all have the same quality to it. And so, 'I don't care' means that you've dropped it, you're free from it. Before, I was confused, I want to know, I got to know. Now I don't care, I'm okay. What, me worry? So, Ivan, do you have something to say? Nope. Okay. Well, let's go ahead and finish this up. Does anybody have any last thoughts? Anything? You're all satisfied? All right, you can watch this video a second time because it's going to be right here on the, uh, uh, UK channel.

**Speaker D:** I'm not sure if I can talk now.

**Speaker A:** You can talk.

**Speaker D:** Oh, okay, okay, just testing because something's.

**Speaker A:** Wrong.

**Speaker D:** Uh, No, it's something clicks. I mean, it always has clicked, Dhammarato, but it just feels clearer every time after you speak. I was having some difficult time and I don't know, something just clicks. I'm not sure what it is. I'll just practice and I'll see you.

**Speaker A:** Good. If you can take this Buddhist teaching discussion into your practice, you will not wind up in Dukkha. You will not wind up in a self, one of these woeful states. You can stop it at the point of contact so that you can feel the way you want to feel rather than feeling the way that you're setting it up to feel based upon the story that you told yourself from all your old.

**Speaker C:** Samskara.

**Speaker D:** You also feel kind of nice because my earlier question was about kind of shocked that I'm seeing myself more clearly when I'm with other people. And it's kind of, rather than feeling sorry, I can stop interrupting the process. I can slow it down. And yeah, a bunch of stuff to play with.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's in fact the point that you're making now, is what the Buddha said. Within this context of Paticcasamuppada, at any point along the line, you can say, "Aha! I see that! I see you, Mara!" So that's the way that we practice. We practice in the sense of waking up. And you wake up at that point, just before you have feelings about it. You've just made up some silly story, Let's go and revise that story before we have feelings about it. Feel the way you want to.

**Speaker D:** Feel. Something also really nice about this practice is always right here, right now. So it's like rather than waiting for something tomorrow, or what it's like, I can just practice right now.

**Speaker A:** Right, it's available right here and now.

**Speaker D:** Makes sense.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, Mikey is not here today, so I'll forego his little talk, and I invite all of you to go check out the website. And one thing that I would like to ask is that if you post on Skype on this page or on the US page, also posted in the groups on the website. Let's start transitioning from Skype over to the.

**Speaker D:** Website.

**Speaker A:** It's getting quite active, and in fact, 4 new people joined just today. Okay, well, thank you all. Thank you, Dhammarato. Thank you.

**Speaker D:** Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Really appreciate it. Have a nice.

**Speaker C:** Day.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye. Thank you. Bye everyone. Bye. Ta-ta for now.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk by Dhammarato offers a practical, experience-based summary of **Paticcasamuppada** (Dependent Origination), framed as an expanded version of the **Second Noble Truth** (the cause of *dukkha*, or suffering). Here are the key points:

---

### **1. Paticcasamuppada as the Second Noble Truth**
- The 12 links of Dependent Origination detail how suffering arises from ignorance and craving.
- It’s **not strictly linear** but involves “looping” back and forth, like detours on a road trip.

---

### **2. The First Half: From Ignorance to Contact**
- **Ignorance (avijjā)**: Starting point—like a newborn’s raw ignorance, compounded by learning without wisdom.
- **Formations (saṅkhāra)**: The “pile of stuff” we accumulate—memories, habits, skills (physical, verbal, mental).  
  - *Example*: An American learns to catch keys; a Thai person might not. These are bodily *saṅkhāras*.
- **Consciousness (viññāṇa)**: Raw sensory input (seeing, hearing, etc.).
- **Mind & Matter (nāma-rūpa)**: The process of “making stuff up”—interpreting raw input using stored *saṅkhāras*.  
  - *Example*: When “tree” is heard, each person imagines a different tree from memory.
- **Six Sense Bases (saḷāyatana)**: The internal sense impression (e.g., mental image of a tree).
- **Contact (phassa)**: The impact of that internal impression—**not reality itself, but our story about it**.

This first half happens **automatically and quickly** (like reaction time tests).

---

### **3. The Second Half: From Feeling to Suffering**
- **Feeling (vedanā)**: Three types—liking, disliking, confusion.  
  - This is the **core of the Second Noble Truth**—the root of craving.
- **Craving (taṇhā)**: “I want it” or “I don’t want it.”
- **Clinging (upādāna)**: “I’ve got to have it (or avoid it).”
- **Becoming (bhava)**: The arising of a “self” that wants/clings.
- **Birth (jāti)**: The full emergence of that self (who suffers).
- **Suffering (dukkha)**: The result—aging, death, sorrow, etc.

When a “self” is born through craving/clinging, it enters one of **four woeful states**:
1. **Hell** – trapped in anger.
2. **Hungry Ghost** – insatiable wanting.
3. **Animal** – dull, obedient dissatisfaction (e.g., disliking work/school).
4. **Asura** – fearful, combative anxiety.

---

### **4. The Key to Freedom: Breaking the Chain**
- **Practice in reverse**: Start by noticing suffering, then trace it back to craving/feeling.
- **Interrupt at contact**: Use **wisdom at the point of contact** to change the story before it triggers craving.  
  - *Example*: See an attractive person → “I like the appearance, but I don’t want it.”  
  - *Zen story*: The monk who carried a woman across a river set her down, while the younger monk “still carried her” mentally.
- **Use phrases like “I don’t know and I don’t care”** to dissolve confusion and craving.
- **Recycle with wisdom**: If a story leads to craving, go back, fetch a better thought (e.g., a happy memory), and create a new story that brings peace.

---

### **5. The Ultimate Goal**
1. **First step**: Recognize *dukkha* and its cause.
2. **Second step**: Learn to control feelings by reshaping your stories.
3. **Final step**: Stop making stories altogether—abide in direct experience without clinging, beyond *dukkha*.

---

### **6. Practical Notes**
- This teaching is **dense and worth revisiting**—understanding deepens with practice.
- It’s about **seeing the process in real-time** and choosing not to engage the chain of suffering.
- **Self-hypnosis** and guided meditation share techniques (e.g., relaxation, suggestion), but the Dhamma aims at lasting freedom, not temporary states.

---

### **In a Nutshell**
**Paticcasamuppada** explains how we create suffering moment-to-moment by weaving stories out of ignorance and habit—and how we can break free by **bringing wisdom to the point of contact**, reshaping our narratives, and ultimately ceasing to cling to any “self” that suffers.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on your transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain the complex Buddhist concept of *Paticcasamuppada* (Dependent Origination). Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **1. Journey & Detour Metaphor**
- **Metaphor**: Driving a car from one city to another.
- **Purpose**: To illustrate that the 12 links of Dependent Origination are not strictly linear (1, 2, 3…), but involve “looping around.” Just as you might detour, backtrack, or search for a gas station, the mind loops back through ignorance and conditioning (*saṅkhāra*).

---

### **2. The Pile of Books / Pile of Dirt Metaphor**
- **Metaphor**: *Saṅkhāra* (mental formations, memories, habits) as a **disorganized pile of books**—some open, some closed, stacked haphazardly.
- **Extended**: Also called a **“pile of dirt”**—everyone is “an emperor of their own pile of dirt.”
- **Purpose**: To explain how our stored memories and habits are unstructured, hard to navigate, and easily lead us astray when we search for something. We often grab unrelated “books” (memories) and combine pages to form new concepts.

---

### **3. Physical *Saṅkhāra* Examples**
- **Story/Example**: **Throwing and catching keys** in America vs. Thailand.
  - In America, people learn to throw/catch (e.g., from baseball culture).
  - In Thailand, many see a ball as a “weapon” and don’t learn to catch; they hand keys directly.
- **Other examples**: Putting pants on backwards, playing music, writing.
- **Purpose**: To show *saṅkhāra* as learned physical habits (not instinctual), stored in the body.

---

### **4. Ego-State Metaphor (Parent/Adult/Child)**
- **Metaphor**: 
  - *Citta* (heart/mind) = **Child ego-state** (emotions, feelings).
  - Verbal *saṅkhāra* = **Parent ego-state** (rules, “shoulds”).
  - *Manas* (intellect) = **Adult ego-state** (observing, reasoning).
- **Purpose**: To clarify different aspects of mind and how feelings (especially fear-based vs. joyful) are stored and triggered.

---

### **5. The “Tree” Mental Image Demonstration**
- **Interactive example**: When Speaker A says “tree,” he asks listeners what mental image arises.
- **Result**: Each person imagines a different tree (e.g., childhood tree, fan palm, etc.).
- **Purpose**: To show how sensory input (word “tree”) triggers a search through personal *saṅkhāra*, leading to a mental image (*nāma-rūpa*) that may not match reality or others’ images.

---

### **6. Reaction Time & Animal Comparisons**
- **Metaphor/Example**: **Reaction-time tests** (clicking when screen turns green).
  - Average person: ~250–350 ms.
  - Trained athletes: ~200 ms.
  - Cats: ~65 ms.
- **Story**: A **Formula One driver** who must avoid an old lady on the track without thinking (“Old lady, you shouldn’t be here!”), or else he’ll hit her.
- **Purpose**: To illustrate how extra mental processing (making stories, feeling fear) slows reaction and causes suffering. Animals react faster because they don’t add stories.

---

### **7. The Monk and the Woman at the River (Zen Story)**
- **Story**: Two monks encounter a woman afraid to cross a river. The older monk carries her across. Later, the younger monk criticizes him for touching a woman. The older monk replies, **“I set her down on the other side; you are still carrying her.”**
- **Purpose**: To show how clinging (*upādāna*) and mental baggage persist even after an event is over, and how wisdom means not carrying stories forward.

---

### **8. Ajahn Sumedho and the Painted Lady**
- **Story**: At a *Kathina* ceremony, Ajahn Chah nudges Ajahn Sumedho to look at beautifully dressed women. Sumedho says, **“I like it, but I don’t want it.”**
- **Purpose**: To illustrate **wisdom at the point of contact**—recognizing a pleasant sensation without letting it trigger craving/clinging.

---

### **9. The Four Woeful States as Metaphors for Self-Birth**
Each “woeful state” is a metaphor for a type of suffering born from clinging:
- **Hell**: Feeling trapped, angry (can’t escape).
- **Hungry Ghost (*Preta*)**: Like a pot with a tiny mouth—always hungry, never satisfied.
- **Dumb Animal**: Doing what you’re told without enjoyment (e.g., kids hating school).
- **Titans/Asuras**: Dressed for battle but afraid—constant fear/paranoia.
- **Purpose**: To explain how different types of craving/aversion lead to different “births” of self (*jāti*) and corresponding suffering.

---

### **10. Husband Slamming the Door**
- **Story**: A husband argues with his wife, eventually slams the door, and leaves.
- **Purpose**: To show how we often realize *dukkha* (suffering) only late in the cycle, but we could have stopped it earlier with wisdom.

---

### **11. Hypnosis Comparison**
- **Metaphor**: Hypnosis as similar to guided meditation or self-talk.
- **Story**: A hypnotist who could induce orgasms in women just with words (for sensual purposes).
- **Purpose**: To distinguish between skillful self-awareness (Buddhist practice) and mere suggestion/entertainment, while acknowledging similarities in technique.

---

### **12. “I Don’t Know and I Don’t Care”**
- **Catchphrase**: Used as a practical tool to break the chain at the point of confusion or craving.
- **Purpose**: To illustrate how letting go of the need to know or control can stop the cycle of *saṅkhāra* → clinging → suffering.

---

### **Overall Teaching Strategy**
The speaker uses **everyday metaphors** (driving, piles of books, sports, cultural differences) and **memorable stories** (monks, teachers, personal experiences) to make the abstract sequence of Dependent Origination relatable and practical. The goal is to show how the process happens in real time and how we can “interrupt” it with mindfulness and wisdom.
