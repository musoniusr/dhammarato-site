### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Whenever you want to talk, but go ahead, Ivan.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so as I was saying, basically dissatisfaction, like I say, oh, I hate how messy my room is, but because of that I was like, oh, okay, I can make a change out of this, you know. Like it's basically the dissatisfaction that actually sparked the desire to make a change. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, if your room's messy, it could be a trigger for something that frustrates you, you know. But can you be okay with your room being messy? And can you be okay if you don't have the time to clean it? And can you be satisfied if you do have the time to clean it? It doesn't really matter, you know. You know, Zen Master Seung Sahn said, "Trying is better than God, better than Buddha, better than Enlightenment." better than anything. But not just trying, but giving an earnest trying, like a no-bullshit trying. If you're really giving an earnest trying, an earnest practice, and ironically an earnest trying in the Dhamma is an earnest doing, it's attempting to make the change and also going forth and making the change. But of course we're only human, we're not perfect, so When we do make mistakes, if there is things in our environment that frustrate us, can we be okay with that? You have to ask yourself that question. You're not a slob, probably. And even if you were, who cares? But you're probably not a slob. And if your room's dirty, who gives a shit? And if you want it clean, clean it. If you want it moderately clean, clean it moderately. And it's no big deal. You're not hurting anybody. You're not hurting yourself. You're not causing Dukkha for anything, so give yourself a break, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's wonderfully put, really. Because speaking for myself, I have this sort of— I've been making a lot of effort to pay attention every time I feel dissatisfied. So let's put, if when it comes to cleaning the room, example, if I catch myself feeling, you know, giving too much shit, give like, you know, in this state of frustration, I catch myself and I say, there's really no need for that. I've been really practicing this throughout my life. I mean, my whole day, to be honest, like If I catch myself, I think that's the right effort, right? Like, you know, every time we catch it, we can just remind ourselves. And that's basically— I think that's what Dhammarato always advised. I'm not sure. I feel like it can be a bit too neurotic. I'm sometimes scared that—.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you gotta let go of all those thoughts, man. I could almost feel that you have a clinging to all those thoughts. You want to get it right. You want to figure it out. You want to— you're tired of not figuring it out. You're tired of not getting it right, as all of us have experienced and are experiencing and will experience. But can you be okay with just being the way you are? Somebody was talking, and I think they got it from Alan Watts, but somebody was talking the other day about how the bushes and trees and plants in the forest, they're just, uh, they're all perfect. You know, there's not an incorrect bush or incorrect plant because its root structure dug into the soil improperly.

**Speaker B:** You know, yeah, Michael said it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and when we look at— and he's right— and when we look at those plants, we're making likings, dislikings, distinctions, being and becoming, labels we're putting on all these things. But if we look at them with the Dhamma eyes of reality, it's just perfect nature. Nature doesn't really make mistakes, and we're like those plants. There's no imperfect human. You could be like, yeah, but some of them are serial killers, some of them are this. That's just their actions. That's not who they are. Yeah, but this guy's crazy and this guy's normal. That's just more assumptions and labels. Their true nature from seeing with the Dhamma eyes is what all of our nature is, which is just pure peace, pure emptiness, pure stillness. In the moment, right here, right now. But most likely the serial killer will go on being a serial killer. The person who's anxious will go on being anxious. The person who's a delight to be around will probably go on being a delight to be around. But what they all have in common is that they're sticking with their characters. And the reality of the situation is they're all free. They're all perfect. They're all Buddhas right here and right now. But oftentimes we can't see the things that are right in front of us, right within us, because we're distracted in this mind of thoughts, feelings, and emotions, which is Samsara. And we have the ability to see Samsara for what it is, which is just Anicca, Dukkha, and Arhat. And we can choose not to be a part of that or not to take notice of it if we want. And oftentimes a lot of people ask the question, how do I practice Sati? You know, a lot of people, I feel like they think that's a difficult thing to do. How do I remember? And I've always held the opinion that the Sati isn't the difficult thing, or what can appear to be difficult. What appears to be difficult for a lot of people, especially beginners, is the changing part. Everybody knows when they're angry because we all say, I'm angry, I'm frustrated. We all know when we have frustration. The remembering to me is not really the the thing that's the challenge. We all kind of are aware all the time of our emotions. What we're not so aware of is that we have the ability to change it. We think that we're under the control of something else that we can't change, like everything else in reality. But the only reality is in our mind. Is thoughts, feelings, and emotions. We have the ability to change it, and that's what we need to be aware of. That's what we need to remember. You know, we need to remember that we can change it, but then we have to go further and actually change it, which is what people have the most trouble with. They could remember they feel like shit. Everybody can do that. You got to remember to change it. To be active doing it. You know what I mean? How many of you feel like shit right now? How many feel frustrated right now? How many feel happy right now? The practice of the Dharma is becoming aware of how we're beholden to our emotions, thoughts, and feelings right now and letting them go. And that's why the Zen masters will say— will ring the bells at the Zen dos or temples or whatever and they're always bringing themselves back to the breath, back to the moment, because that's the whole practice is when the mind wanders, like Dhammarato says, we go, ah, never mind, start again, come back to the breath, come back to reality, the Dhamma. Everybody has this idea of the Dhamma is like this foreign concept that's difficult to grasp. The Dhamma is right here, right now, nature reality. It is the thoughts, feelings, and emotions. There's nothing aside from your thoughts, feelings, and emotions. But if they're looked under a microscope, there's not really much there. It's all Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta. So nothing really matters to a degree. But a lot of people get stuck on that phrase even. Well, everything's meaningless, nothing matters, I might as well become a nihilist. And the Buddha is not a nihilist. Not in that regard, but rather you get to a state of satisfaction, like I always say, like smelling a beautiful flower, where there is no birth nor death. There is no— there's no 'I have to.' There's no 'life is meaningless' or 'it's very meaningful.' These ideas, these concepts themselves, these things that we consider ourselves to be disappear when we bring ourselves back to reality. And the practice of the Dharma is not the Dharma itself, it's bringing us back to the Dhamma. Back to what's the Dhamma? The Dhamma is reality right here, right now, being satisfied right here and now. The truth is everything's okay right now, but we lie to ourselves, and society's taught us to lie to ourselves that everything's not okay. That we have all these problems. So any other questions at all?

**Speaker B:** Oh, sorry, Michael.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I just wanted to make a quick point about your first question, Ivan, because I had a discussion about this recently. And, you know, your question about there being useful dissatisfaction And even the example of the messy room was the same example that was presented to me, or that was used, which is, you know, if you have no dissatisfaction and you're sitting around in your room and it gets messier, you know, eventually the smell is going to get worse and worse. But the answer to that is that the whole of the human race is driven by dissatisfaction. And what the Buddha calls craving is an unconscious mechanism where the mind chases after what is pleasant, it pushes away what is unpleasant, and it circles in confusion around what is neither pleasant nor unpleasant due to the habit of chasing after the pleasant, pushing away the unpleasant. And there's confusion and doubt in regard to that neutral or neither sensation. And that's all ignorant. But once the Dhamma is seen, Once it is seen that all things arise due to causes and conditions, that they're part of a dynamic system that we call nature, we gain enough awareness and wisdom in order to base our behavior not on that unconscious mechanism of dissatisfaction. And also, when the Dharma is seen, we see that basing our choices On dissatisfaction leads to suffering, leads to dukkha, leads to stress. So we decide to abandon dissatisfaction, right? That's the second noble truth, to abandon the cause of dukkha. And so what do we use to guide our behavior when we no longer rely on dissatisfaction? It's like dissatisfaction, craving, is like something we've been devoted to unconsciously our entire lives. And just as you're bringing up today, Ivan, everything tries to convince us to go back to it. Everything, including little things like, well, what about your dirty room? You know, but the easy answer to that is that once we gain the wisdom that dissatisfaction has no purpose in our life, we instead use mindfulness and wisdom to guide our behavior. We don't need to have dissatisfaction to know that we need to clean our room. We need to just take a look, see that it's messy, and decide to clean it. That doesn't mean we're dissatisfied with it being messy. It means that we know that a clean room is a room where we're not going to stub our toes, we're not going to have rotten food, we're not going to have allergies from dust, we're not going to have, you know, mold growing in the corners that's going to affect our health. Like, we are wise enough to know that the room is better when it's clean. It's going to disturb the mind less when it's clean. As Dhamma Das was pointing out, once you know that you can be satisfied with or without a clean room, then you can make a free choice. That's the way Dhammarato puts it. You can make a free choice to clean your room rather than having dissatisfaction drive your behavior. He says, Dhammarato often says, that I saw recently in an old video of his where he was talking about the sitting practice. And he was saying sitting around, even if you can get into the arupa jhanas, those don't really have a strong function in daily life. So why don't we sit down and develop a useful skill, which is to be satisfied with things as they are? And then if you can develop that skill to the degree where you can be satisfied in any condition, right? You have a lot of work to do. You're a parent. You have responsibilities, you have stresses and things that you need to look after. But if you have the skill of being satisfied through all of those conditions, then you can make free choices in your life. You can respond to the world with mindfulness and wisdom rather than unconsciously being driven by greed, hatred, and delusion. So even though there's a sutta in the Anguttara Nikaya where the Buddha says that there's a craving that leads to the end of craving, There's many more suttas from earlier texts that support the idea that it's really mindfulness and wisdom, the Noble Eightfold Path itself, that becomes the driver of further training rather than continuing to rely on craving and dissatisfaction as your motivating factor. You simply just don't need it anymore. We're too faithful to dissatisfaction, and the whole world is too. So that's why people will continuously tell you, you need dissatisfaction, you need craving.

**Speaker A:** Anagami.

**Speaker C:** You don't need it at all, it needs you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, makes sense.

**Speaker A:** Makes sense.

**Speaker B:** Um, I, I sometimes— I think the scary thing about, oh, just relying— I mean, when I'm not mindful, right, I have that thought, oh, just rely on my wisdom and my mindfulness to make decision for me, or like just a free choice, as you said. I think it's scary on some levels because maybe it's new to me. Maybe it's the ego there too. Like, you know, it's like, you know, I mean, yeah, I pretty much just answered my own question. It's like, there's this, but there's this freedom associated with the fear itself. I guess I always feel uncomfortable when I catch myself about to be that dissatisfied. I can say, well, it's all right, I don't have to go there. And there's this— I wish I could describe that feeling. It's weird, I guess. But I guess that's the process of change, maybe. I'm just saying, I'm not really saying much, but Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Fear.

**Speaker C:** Fear is at the bottom of it. Um, you know, I've said this before because I don't remember who said this, but if you identify with your passions, then when your passions die, you die. Um, yeah, that's, that's where clinging lies in the dark. And, you know, um, have you ever experienced power outage? Sorry, have you ever experienced a power outage, Ivan?

**Speaker B:** Power outrage?

**Speaker C:** Power outage, like where the electricity— Oh.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, power outage. Yes, yes, yes, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker C:** That's a good time to reflect on, on, you know, where your clinging is. You know, like you don't have access to your distractions, the sun goes down, it gets dark, and oftentimes you can't avoid what the mind will bring up. But for me, I don't know, contemplating the loss of vision was a good one. If you ever really sat down and thought what it would be like to suddenly go blind and then never be able to see again, how small the world would feel. And then you can sense an anxiety about that thought. And so we have this relationship with the senses. And we base our sense of self on the senses. That's why the Buddha teaches us that sensory consciousness is like an empty village. That's not where we really are. And they're fragile and impermanent. And if we identify with the sense doors, then when they degrade with old age or by an accident, then we'll experience a death. But it's the same thing with all of your thoughts and your feelings and your stories in your mind. That you identify with them. And dissatisfaction is at the root of all of them. So the reason why the mind keeps coming up with new reasons to hold on to dissatisfaction is because currently the you that you experience is itself dissatisfaction. So it's sort of like an existential crisis to let it go. It feels like a death. And The Buddha says a happy mind is easily concentrated, or he says a happy mind is easily Samadhi'd, I guess you can say. And so if you remain satisfied to the point where the mind becomes clear, you'll start to notice that you are not your thoughts, you're not your feelings, you're not your dissatisfaction, you're not your stories. Although there's not really a you in there to stand, but the experience of it, the knowing of it, you know, is the closest thing to who you may feel you are. So at first you can gain a distance by taking a stand right there, but I always like to use Ajahn Chah's advice to stand on the shore of liberation at the perception of impermanence. You know, because that's where you start to put a distance between you and the things that the mind creates. And then there won't be as much fear in letting go of these things. It's the things that your identity is tied up in are the hardest things to let go of.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it makes sense. Sometimes I was thinking, because You could say the Buddhism or the meditation, Anapanasati, everything we're talking about is a change process. I sometimes think that it's the change itself by just stopping. Because I always keep remembering what the Buddha said to— I forgot his name, but there's a serial killer, right? He's trying to catch up with the Buddha, but for some reason he couldn't catch up and he said stop. And the Buddha said, I have already stopped. Have you? And it really got me thinking, maybe the change itself is just to stop.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, a lot, a lot of people are trying to gain something. It's a process of letting go completely. Letting go. There's that old Zen phrase, it's like If you let go a little bit, you'll have a little peace. If you let go a lot, you'll have a lot of peace. You let go completely, you'll have complete peace. And that's— when I hear that phrase, I'm always like, man, that's the entirety of the teaching. Don't worry, be happy. The mind will naturally wander, and then we just take a deep breath and come back, say never mind, start again. We come back to the breath. Take a deep breath of relaxation. It's not like everything else in life where you're trying to figure it out— how to be the best student, how to be the best school student, how to be the best teacher, how to be the best practitioner. It's just relaxing, and we're getting into Nibbana. And for those of you who are new or not familiar, You might be more familiar with the word Nirvana or enlightenment, but Nibbana was a word they used in the Buddhist time for food, and it was to cool off food. It was when the process that happens to food when it cools off, it Nibbana. So it quite literally means to chill out, and that's what we're all in the practice of doing. Is chilling out. Because the Buddha said, both formally and now, I teach one thing and one thing only: dukkha, dukkha, Nirodha. And dukkha means suffering, and Nirodha means the cessation of that. So the only thing he taught was satisfaction. And the way he taught it was something called the Eightfold Noble Path. And our teacher Dhammarato says that it's more of a doorway and less of a path. Because a path would imply something in the future that we still want to get that we haven't got right now. Because ironically, that's the very essence of Dukkha, is wanting things to be different than they are, or wanting to obtain something that we don't have right now, wanting things to be different than they are. That is Dukkha. That's dissatisfaction, often translated as suffering, but a better translation is dissatisfaction, being unsatisfied. But we want Sukkha, joy, and all our practice is, is the holy alchemy of turning lead into gold, of turning dissatisfaction into satisfaction, Dukkha into Sukkha.. And we do this by remembering to look at our state of mind, thoughts, feelings, emotions in a balanced way throughout the day. Not a crazy way that drives us insane, but 6 or 7 times throughout our day. We've developed these good Sankharas, these good habits, these good Kamma of coming back to the breath, checking in with our thoughts, feelings, emotions. How are you feeling today? How am I doing right now? Oh, everything's okay. And then you're going to get frustrated. These baby Dukkhas, these baby suffering plants, are going to grow in our garden. But that's okay. We tend to the mind of the garden throughout our day. That's the practice. Just like a gardener, he's not out there on his hands and knees every second of every day looking for weeds. No, but he's watering the plants, cultivating good, nurturing, wholesome thoughts. Eventually he sees a little weed popping up and he gently takes it out. And this is not hard work for him. This is not a labor for him. It can be if you make it, which we're not doing. We're making it a joy to do. People love gardening because it relaxes, and it's so similar to the practice of the Dharma and turning our mind into something beautiful and bearing beautiful fruits eventually of peace and emptiness and discovering our true nature away from this idea of the ego, of the character, of the soul that lasts forever. We're getting away from that and saying we're not that important. Our body is just the elements. It's just dirt. Can you be okay with that? Yeah, but what about this? But what about that? Can you be okay with not knowing all the answers? Yeah, but I should be a better Buddhist. I should be more happier. Can you be okay with just being good enough, happy enough? And if we take a look at right here, right now, the truth is it's good enough. You know, we got clothes, we got roofs, we got some food probably. You know, everything's okay. There's no problems. Everything's good enough. It's like, have you ever babysat any kids? If you babysit a kid that you don't want to babysit, what are his characteristics like? He's always— he or she is always dissatisfied, spoiled, always wanting more. Even if you give them something, they want more and more. Monsters, you know, hungry ghosts. But what's the type of child we wouldn't mind babysitting? A type of child who just wants to sit there and read his book, and he's happy as a clam. Just give him some food and water once in a while. That's the kid we want to babysit, who's content with content with very little and is actually more than content, he's joyous with very little. And that's the type of mind we want to develop. But our society has spoiled the mind. But now we're going to re-raise that mind, become the parents to our own mind and say, no, these things are not acceptable anymore. And we don't have to be strict and horrible to our mind. Just like a child, in a balanced way, you help to nurture and grow with wholesome nurturing thoughts and speech and actions. And then over time, just like everything else in life, things get easier. And it's not even difficult in the first place. It's actually a joy. So nothing is easier than practicing the Dharma. We make it difficult. We say we're never going to get enlightened, which everybody already is enlightened. It's just your ignorance that makes you think you're not enlightened. It takes some time sometimes to get rid of that ignorance to show, no, you're fine. Arya. You're perfect. Everything's okay. Take a deep breath and just let it out and relax. And problems will come, good things will come. Don't get too attached to the good things when they come, and don't get too crazy about the bad things when they come— quote, bad things. And really, good and bad, it's just things happening. We make them good or bad. The practice of the Dharma is just to be satisfied with the way things are, and if you're not satisfied, change it until you are satisfied. You know, anybody else have anything they want to talk about or have thoughts about or questions? Feel free, we're just chilling. Don't have to, uh, don't have to be afraid or anything. Now's the time to ask questions. Hi, bud.

**Speaker E:** I can have a go. I'm not sure if you can hear me okay though, because I've got a bit of a bad connection.

**Speaker A:** Can you hear me? I can hear you a little.

**Speaker B:** Bit.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, a little bit.

**Speaker E:** Only a little bit, right? Like, like, persevere.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's like 70%. It's not bad. Good enough.

**Speaker E:** Okay, all right, let me try. I'll keep it simple. It's a bit of a trivial question.

**Speaker A:** After what's gone.

**Speaker E:** Before, but I'm just curious. I grew up as a massive sports fan.

**Speaker C:** Right?

**Speaker E:** But especially my question is more about being a spectator in sports. Sports and being kind of obsessed with your sports team and stuff like that. Now I'm pretty sure the Buddha wouldn't have really given a damn about soccer or, you know, sports like that, and probably wouldn't have had a team. But I'm just curious to get your thoughts and anyone else's thoughts on how do you interact with that kind of thing nowadays, that kind of so-called pleasures and even obsessions of the world, such as sports. If you let go entirely, then surely there's no fun anymore in— like, if I don't care whatsoever whether my team wins or loses, then maybe I don't actually enjoy it so much. And then, but maybe that's not a bad thing. Maybe that's okay. So anyway, just curious to get your thoughts. I'm literally watching my— there's a big soccer match on tonight, and so I'm just quite curious which my team's playing in. So I'm quite curious to get your thoughts, and it might help me to sort of stay a bit calmer than usual and not actually care that much about something which is obviously not that important in the grand scheme of things anyway, but we create stories out of it. Anyway, that's why I'm not— I hope you're able to hear it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, we heard it. Anybody else want to answer or have any thoughts on what that dude.

**Speaker B:** Said?

**Speaker D:** Can you hear.

**Speaker A:** Me? Mm-hmm.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, let me just put my thoughts on this out.

**Speaker B:** I just thought.

**Speaker D:** About that I think it's just as worse or as bad as you put your, like, as you cling to it, maybe. And, um, and pretty much there's no big difference in between, like, watching it, watching a child and just being happy because you see it play, see him play, you see her play, um, and watching a soccer game and seeing them play and being happy, or it makes you happy. It's maybe just a matter of how much you cling to it, I would.

**Speaker B:** Say.

**Speaker D:** Very.

**Speaker A:** Good. Anybody else have any thoughts on.

**Speaker B:** That?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I would, um, I would say this is sort of a fun question. Because, you know, the traditional, or I guess you could say the orthodox response would be to let go of everything that is gratifying in the world so that you can experience the sort of gratification that is independent of sensory stimulation, right? That's part of Dharma.

**Speaker B:** Practice.

**Speaker C:** But the way that Dhammarato teaches I feel is pretty effective in that oftentimes when we let go of things that we enjoy, like watching sports, we're doing it because we feel like we should. Because if I'm a Buddhist, then I'm supposed to get to this nonsensory gratification in order to abandon clinging. So then you sort of abandon the things that you enjoy before you have that type of pleasure, that pleasure of Jhana, I guess you can say. And so the way he put it is that then you follow the rule and then you resent it, right? Because you've taken away something that you enjoy and you're doing it because it's a rule and you resent it. The way Dhammarato says we should approach the Dharma is to start with satisfaction, let that satisfaction grow deeper and deeper until that satisfaction is complete. At least that's the way I understand it. Understand it. So rather than saying like you shouldn't watch your sports team because it stimulates the mind or whatever, go ahead and watch the sports, enjoy it, get fully lost in it, get fully attached to your team, and then when the game ends, let it go completely. You know, so you have— you're giving yourself the opportunity to practice letting go because What the Dharma is really about, the reason that we cultivate the experience of a pleasant abiding that is not based in sensory experience or sensory stimulation, is one, because stimulating the senses is habit-forming. We kind of become addicted to the dopamine. But the other reason is to take the mind to an alternative source of stimulation so that we can clarify it to the point where we can see the Dukkha in this cycle of pursuing things external, the mind going outside of itself for gratification. But ultimately what that's about is renouncing clinging, because clinging is really the cause of suffering. That's why the Buddha summarizes in the Dhammachakkappavattana Sutta, you know, he says in summary, you know, Dukkha is these five aggregates afflicted by clinging. These five aggregates are the constituents of experience. It's basically everything we experience in the world. Or everything that life is, essentially. So the removal of clinging is really the point. And if you have enough awareness that, you know, you're watching a sports team because you enjoy it, and that you need to, like, you know, have a team and get lost in having a team and that competitive spirit in order to enjoy it, then go ahead and let yourself do it. If you know that you're not gonna kill anybody over it, or, you know, go and become addicted to alcohol because your team lost. If you're able to sort of enjoy it and then let it all go afterwards, I think that that's a safe enough pleasure at the moment. Because, you know, the way that we approach the practice, by, you know, the way Bodhisattva Bhikkhu and Dhammarato taught, is to make the choice to change the mind, to practice being satisfied. So when your team loses, then go ahead and go back to being satisfied. You know, just practice satisfaction in all contexts is what I'm getting at, instead of following rules and then resenting it. And then if there comes a point where the satisfaction is so complete that you no longer find yourself interested in sports, then that's probably a good time to drop it. But you don't have to. That's what I would say about it now. It just depends on where you are in your.

**Speaker A:** Practice. And in truth— go ahead, Buddy.

**Speaker B:** Oh no, I just want to add something real quick. I remember watching Amon talking about this with lay people about entertainment and all this sort of thing. The person was basically just Maybe a bit different context, but he realized he spent too much time watching TV, and he was wondering if the monk has any advice. And surprisingly, the monk said something about you don't really have to drop everything if you are not at that stage. It's way more efficient to pay attention to the precepts and the note. Something like that, like you don't really have to go that far if you're not sort of like following the flow, I guess. I just feel like pointing that out because I've been struggling with the same thing sometimes, and I feel like just asking myself to drop something may actually.

**Speaker A:** Backfire. Yeah, reality is reality, and we can make it a struggle, or we can make it very relaxing and fun and joyful. When you're at a soccer game, you and your mind are telling yourself, well, I'm at a soccer game. There's certain things that come along with soccer games. There's alcohol, there's teams, there's this team versus that team, there's there's some women in the stands, mostly men, everybody's screaming, some chanting. You say that's a soccer game. But when you're in a wat, you may be around some monks, there may be some nuns walking around, there may be chanting, there may be some rowdiness once in a while. There may be some Bhikkhuni. It's just reality. You say it's a soccer game. You say that's a soccer game and that's a wat and this is a monk and this is a layperson. But the Dhamma, the reality of the situation is what's going on in your mind, what's going on in reality, it's just nature. If you make it something more than it is or less than it is, It's on you. There's not much difference between society and living in a wat or a temple. You still get a cast of characters, you still get a leader, you still get the ones who are new, you still get— and just like the soccer game, you get uniforms, you know. But we make these distinctions of this and that and liking and disliking and being and becoming. And if you're having fun, if you're joyful, if you're feeling peaceful and not causing Dukkha for yourself or anybody else, do whatever you wish. You didn't make any monk vows to not do this or not do that. If you make monk vows that prohibit you from going to Sakadagami, then by all means, it's up to you to prove it. If you're making the vow, obviously you want to stick with it, I would assume, you know. But for most of us, and Yeah, you just do what you will as long as it's not causing you or anybody else any Dukkha. It's just people. If you make things bigger than they are, then they become religious, then they become icons, idols. Then a little drinking bowl becomes something that you want to put behind glass because the Buddha drank from it, like Dhammarato was saying in this video the other day. Becomes a relic when the truth is it's just a fucking wooden bowl. You know, the truth is that's why I like Zen so much. The hitting you on the head with the stick, the ringing of the bell, it's wakey wakey, waking you up back to reality of none of that shit is really important. What's important is how you're feeling. How's your relationship with what's going on right now? Have you discovered your true nature? Are you still wandering around thinking that you're your thoughts, feelings, and emotions? Or you're your body? You know, discover your true nature, like Bodhidharma would always say. And your true nature, I'll even tell you what it is. It's just peace and emptiness and joy. And you could debate and say, well, technically, no, it's not peace. And technically, you could do that all day long. The truth is those words are the closest thing that comes to it. It's just chilling out. It's not a Rubik's Cube problem to solve. It's not a great mystery that only I've discovered and nobody else, or only the Buddha or Jesus has discovered. No, we all could understand this. A child could understand this. Problems will come in this life. Thoughts, feelings, and emotions build our reality. So let's build a good one. Why feel like shit when we have the choice to feel good? You know, enjoy anybody. Yeah, enjoy your life. Life is good. Life is good enough, you know, and good enough is perfect. Then all of a sudden you're walking around on cloud nine all the time. You're walking around in heaven all the time. Because you're okay with whatever happens. In a way, you're just like an observer. Like that saying in Theravada, the one who knows. You're just sitting back and enjoying the ride, you know? Some people are scared, some people are happy, some people are this, but you're just sitting back and watching all these things unfold. I'm almost 40 years old, and in a weird way, I always felt like I just joyfully have not done anything in my life. But observe like I'm on something. And some people might— and I'm not saying in a way that's like, oh, I haven't done anything. No, I'm saying in a joyful way, like, I used to be scared as a kid, like, how am I going to get older? How am I going to do this? How am I going to pay bills? But it just happened. And it almost took zero effort on my part. You know, everything just happens. Some people live, some people get sick, some people die. And I'm just watching it all with a smile on my face, like, huh, This reality thing is pretty.

**Speaker B:** Cool.

**Speaker A:** You don't have to do anything if you really think about it.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's very.

**Speaker A:** True. Just enjoy.

**Speaker B:** Um, I, I forgot who said this, but something about, um, when he reflects on his life, 90% of his worry never happened. And the worries that did happen, yeah, yeah, never really killed him, something like that. I really got— yeah, that's right.

**Speaker A:** Most, yeah, like 80-something percent, 90% of our anxieties, the problems we worried about never even really took place during our life. It was just the worry that was the worst.

**Speaker B:** Part.

**Speaker A:** We have nothing to fear but fear itself, like that one dude said. Whoever, whoever, whatever famous American.

**Speaker C:** Dudes.

**Speaker A:** FDR, right? FDR, yeah, great saying and so true. You have, yeah, you have nothing to fear but fear itself. As long as you don't fear fear, you know, there's no fear there.

**Speaker C:** The deeper the enjoyment, the deeper the satisfaction, the less of a need for external stimulation you'll have. And, you know, usually people try to approach this the other way around, like, I'm going to go cold turkey on the world, stop doing everything I enjoy so I can, you know, experience this causeless bliss of the Dhamma. And they sit there holding their breaths until they die. And they make no progress because they haven't seen clearly into how this relationship between dissatisfaction and Dukkha is just cycling on and on and on. And so that's why Dhammarato cuts through the Gordian Knot, as he says, instead of trying to untie the knot. Satisfied, choose to enjoy your life. You know, if you do things that are breaking of precepts or breaking of rules, okay, continue to be satisfied anyway. Don't punish yourself over it. If you enjoy watching a soccer game, you don't need to beat yourself up over it. Keep practicing being happy. Keep returning to being satisfied, and you'll find that those things fall away on their own if they do. And if they don't, it's okay. You know, you're happy with and happy without. There's not really much else you need to do. And because you're happy, your wisdom grows, your awareness grows, and you start making choices based off of that awareness and that wisdom more so than, you know, needing to do things to get things, needing to do things to be satisfied. You know, you're just already full, so you don't need to add anything to the tank. It's always already.

**Speaker D:** Full. I also, at some point, I thought, like, for example, especially in my free time, like, you know, whatever. So many others.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Anicca, not getting caught.

**Speaker D:** Up in media just to don't think.

**Speaker C:** Anymore. When it comes to the sitting practice, when you approach it, starting with wisdom instead of starting with virtue, you end up sitting because you're satisfied and there's nothing else to do, rather than doing it the other way around where you sit in order to sort of detox the mind and then become satisfied. You know, you start with satisfaction and you end with deep satisfaction. It's a different approach, and maybe it's not for everybody. I think it's a much more effective approach. I've been doing stuff like this for over 20 years at least, and I certainly have done it the other way. And not to say that I had no benefit from doing it that way, but there seems to have been some missing piece that talking to Dhammarato has filled in pretty well. And it's much more in line with what the Buddha says the Dharma is, which he says it's beautiful in the beginning, beautiful in the middle, and beautiful in the end. And I like to think of that as satisfied in the beginning, deeply satisfied in the middle, and completely satisfied in the end. Or that quote that Dhamma Das shared, which was from Ajahn Chah, you know, If you let go a little, you'll have a little bit of peace. If you let go a lot, you'll have a lot of peace. If you let go completely, you have complete peace. It's another way of saying.

**Speaker A:** It.

**Speaker C:** And it's all internal, you know. A lot of times what you're letting go of is letting go of your judgments. So if Thomas goes and watches a soccer game, himself getting angry, he needs to first let go of the anger and then let go of the judgment about being angry and then let go of everything and go back to being satisfied. You know, satisfied and not beating yourself up for getting caught up in a soccer match, as they say.

**Speaker A:** And I would recommend not drinking or smoking any mind-altering things. If possible, just a guideline, then you really have wholesome.

**Speaker F:** Fun.

**Speaker A:** People in this day and age are relying too much on alcohol and mind-altering drugs, and they're becoming more legal, which is good in many ways, but also many people are like children. They don't have the ability to balance out their consumption. And you need a little, just a little discipline, not a lot, not a negative thing, but just a little discipline is very good. Then going to a soccer game, it's like anything.

**Speaker F:** Else. How does one cultivate discipline the best? How do you guys do.

**Speaker A:** It? Anybody want to answer that at.

**Speaker D:** All? Maybe just coming back, practicing all over again. Doesn't matter how many times, just remember to come back right here and.

**Speaker B:** Now.

**Speaker C:** Sati.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Oh, repetition is good, is a good word to think of. Persistence and repetition. So you want to create a new habit that overwhelms the old habit.

**Speaker F:** Essentially.

**Speaker A:** Yes, creating new habits.

**Speaker F:** I think that creates new engroovements in the brain.

**Speaker B:** Or whatever. Arya pathways, perhaps.

**Speaker C:** Arya.

**Speaker F:** Pathways.

**Speaker B:** Go ahead. No, I would say discipline is such an interesting word, something I've been also thinking about quite a lot. But like, in accordance to the Dharma, which is something that comes to mind for me again and again, it's the word right effort. I always remember something Dhammarato told me: too much effort is wrong effort. So I think in terms of discipline, it will be what is enough effort to get something done. So in terms of building habits, that would be like, are we doing too much to the point that sustaining the habit become, you know, like backfires, right? I think that this is where wholesome thoughts and all this comes in. They will be like, can you congratulate yourself every time you remember to come back, every time you remember why this is good for you? Yeah, that's my thoughts. I think it's interesting because I have been thinking about it a lot.

**Speaker A:** That's very good.

**Speaker B:** Ivan. Thank.

**Speaker A:** You.

**Speaker C:** I liked Dhamma Das's example earlier about different kids that you like to sit. And I've recently did potty training with my 3-year-old, and, you know, all the modern evidence supports that, you know, this autonomy versus shamandal stage where kids are learning to develop a sense of autonomy, independence that happens during the potty training stage. And if we approach potty training with like a reward and punishment, or not necessarily reward and punishment, but like with a critical style of parenting, it creates a lot of shame and a lot of insecurity in the child that kind of stays with us when we're older. But if you approach it in a very lighthearted, playful way, and you make it fun and playful and use a lot of like nurturing language and encouragement, then the child learns to poop in the toilet and feel a sense of accomplishment. And then maybe they do it once in a week, they have accidents the rest of the week, and then the next week they get it in the toilet twice. And then you reward that and you're forgiving, you're not critical about the accident. Week, they do it 3 times a day, they start to get it every time, but at no point in that journey were you ever critical. You're always playful, joyful, and nurturing. And so, you know, you could call that discipline, but really what it is is you're cultivating a new habit. The child is used to pooping in their diaper, and now you want them to poop in the toilet, and. And they learn it through persistence and repetition, but in the context of joy and nurturing and forgiveness and play. And so we can actually, we can do that in the Dhamma, or if we're trying to give up a vice, you know, alcohol always comes up, you know, if we're trying to give up something like alcohol, we have to create a new habit and we have to cultivate that new habit of being satisfied without it by being nurturing and playful and joyful with or without it and creating that new habit bit by bit through persistence and repetition, but always in the context of satisfaction and joy and nurturing rather than being critical because these habits we have are ways that we.

**Speaker B:** Try.

**Speaker C:** To avoid bad feelings. So if we give ourselves more bad feeling by trying to break the habit, then we're just going to be harder to break the habit because then we're going to want to do it because we have more bad feeling that we need to get rid of in trying to break it. And so that's the cycle we can get stuck.

**Speaker B:** In.

**Speaker C:** Yes. Very good.

**Speaker F:** What do you guys think about using music as something to be like a stimulus.

**Speaker A:** For satisfaction? Anybody feel free to respond.

**Speaker B:** Or answer. Well, I think— Yeah, go ahead, buddy.

**Speaker D:** I'm sorry.

**Speaker B:** Question came up.

**Speaker D:** From me, me, and because I, for me it's not that much listening to music, but I am really kind of a music maker. And for me, it's like a lot of therapy. Also get stuck in it a lot.

**Speaker B:** Like in.

**Speaker D:** Terms of wanting.

**Speaker C:** To.

**Speaker B:** Teach something.

**Speaker D:** Or Anagami, because I cannot accomplish something like this. And so it's like.

**Speaker B:** A double-sided sword for me sometimes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Can you mute? Oh, there you go. You're saying music can be like therapy, but also if you get too attached to it, it could be a hindrance, like a double-edged sword. Yeah, music is just vibrations. It's just sound. Is it going to cause you Dukkha if you get attached to it? Sure. So anything else in life, you know. Music can be very positive too. Oh, you want that one?

**Speaker B:** Let's see.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's what I'm learning right now.

**Speaker F:** Like, I've been a music producer for, I don't know, 20 years, and I like pick it up and put it down. I just put it down for like a year, and now I'm starting to pick it back up. So it's like.

**Speaker A:** A cycle. That's good, man. Yeah, see, if you're a monk, you take vows, and maybe sometimes the vows are not listening to music. That's a different story, you know. That's why, uh, sometimes I could, I could seem to be very critical of the monastic lifestyle, but, uh, it's not I have anything against it. It's just very confusing for the modern world because not many people are amongst.

**Speaker C:** Not.

**Speaker A:** Many people have even taken any vows with that stuff. And if you have, great, good for you. And I even encourage it in some cases. But it can get confusing for people on the path, like, should I do this? Shouldn't I do that? Should I do this? It does not matter. If you do too much of anything, it will cause you Dukkha. If you get too attached to anything, no matter No matter how wholesome they may appear, it can cause Dukkha, you know. But if it's causing you satisfaction, you're all adults. You don't need anybody to give you rules to follow or not follow. You know, if you're satisfied, you're satisfied. And it's not— you have to use a bit of wisdom too. You can be like, oh, I'm satisfied with doing cocaine every day.

**Speaker B:** It's.

**Speaker A:** Like, no, that's temporary sense pleasure. Don't confuse it with satisfaction. Because the temporary— the difference between the temporary sense pleasure and real satisfaction is that the real satisfaction doesn't cause you or anybody else Dukkha. So you have to have clear vision to see that, to live the right life.

**Speaker F:** Music is more pure in that regard. I mean, yeah, but some people hate that you're listening to music.

**Speaker A:** So Yeah, everybody has their preferences, you know. Like, is it— are you listening to music all the time on full blast and you can't even— it's like, can you spend— are you even able— do you have the ability? And not you, just generally speaking, people have the ability to be by themselves for 10 minutes, for an hour, without going crazy without music? That would be a form of Dukkha, or I need music, I need to go to the clubs, I need to drink when I go to the clubs. I need to blast it in my car because I crave attention from everybody to listen to me and my music. These are— this is Samsara, you know. But relaxing and music happens to come on, or maybe you just feel like listening to a song, there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. Yeah, or producing music or making music. I play all types of instruments. I.

**Speaker B:** Love music.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, no problem.

**Speaker F:** I think we should share the music that we like, maybe like Dharmic music. Yeah, dude, I don't know, we should maybe have a little channel for that on Discord or something.

**Speaker A:** Go for.

**Speaker C:** It, dude. There is a music channel on the Discord. Oh really?

**Speaker B:** Wow.

**Speaker C:** For sharing the.

**Speaker D:** Music.

**Speaker C:** Yeah. Just to not to play devil's advocate, but to just to add something here. Because, you know, the Buddha talks about contemplating the danger, you know, and, you know, a lot of the Dharma is about how the mind is going to respond to the process of dying and death itself. And, you know, when a coworker of mine is in her late 80s and she's losing her vision, and every day she's crying because, you know, she's been working in theater her whole life, and she's been, you know, orchestrating plays and things like that, and she's— her world's getting small, and it's terrifying to her. And for somebody who's enjoyed music your whole life, and let's say you start to lose your hearing when you get older, this could feel like your own death. And there's a sutta where the Buddha talks about this, like there's four mountains closing in on us, one coming from the north, one coming in from the south, one coming from the east, one coming from the west. And this is what he's talking about. He's talking about the degradation of the faculties with old age and death itself. All of the five external senses, and then of course the mind is considered a sense, or the intellect, that degrades too. People get dementia, people get Alzheimer's, people get confused. And a lot of the practice at a more serious level, I guess we could say, is about uprooting the clinging that we have to the senses and to the faculties. And so that's sort of where you go into like a forest at night, or you sit in an empty room, or when your power goes out, you don't do anything about it, and you start seeing how does the mind respond to these more difficult contemplations. Like, what would happen if I suddenly went blind? Because the Mara Nisati, the contemplation of death, is too abstract. You really you're really contemplating an abstract idea of death and an abstract idea of the body that you hold as an image in your mind. But if you contemplate the loss of your senses, like the loss of vision, the loss of hearing, the loss of the ability to walk or take care of yourself, the loss of the ability to like remember the people you love, things like that, you can see whether or not that triggers anxiety in you. Because there's going to come have a point for all of us where those things actually do fall apart. And we want our mind to remain satisfied and peaceful even when that's happening. And so that's a different level of practice. But listening to music is not going to take away your ability to uproot the clinging to the ear. You know, enjoying a beautiful sunset or enjoying the mountains is not going to take away your ability to uproot the clinging to vision. It's the way that you represent these things in your own mind as permanent. We have a delusion in our mind that these things will always be here, even though we know they're not going to be, by way of example. So I say it's okay to continue enjoying music, enjoying beautiful landscapes and enjoying sort of wholesome pleasures, as long as you're able to use mindfulness and wisdom to explore whether or not there is an unconscious clinging to these faculties. Because when you uproot that clinging, it gives rise to an even deeper causeless joy that is the joy of the freedom from the holding on to the sense faculties as something permanent. So yeah, try it out. Try putting yourself in a position that might induce that type of fear and see what the mind.

**Speaker A:** Does.

**Speaker C:** But yeah, without abandoning the practice of being satisfied, you know, before, during.

**Speaker A:** And after. Yeah, very, very good points. And just to add on to something that you said, that's why it is a good idea for a lot of beginners to— not just beginners, anybody, but if you haven't done it, it's good to spend time alone. If you can be in nature, wonderful. If you can be in nature, that's ideal. But if you can only even be in a room with four walls, as Anamali Swami would say, this amazing Indian Swami, Sankhara, same dude. Then that's a great place to start because then you see, are you listening to music because it's just a simple thing that you're doing, or are you listening to it because you need it and want it very badly? Spend some time alone, observe the mind, do some self-investigation. If you're sitting there and it's only been 2 hours and you're like, I need music, I need something to distract me of reality, from reality. Then that's why they put these guidelines in the first place, because a lot of the monks who join the practice, they're new and they're just learning this stuff. And that's how they teach them. They're like, well, let's restrict this, let's restrict that, practice this, practice that, promise you'll do this, because they don't know how to do it on their own. Go away by yourself, turn off the music for a while, stop taking drugs, don't drink alcohol. I would recommend never doing that, but If you are doing it, stop doing it for a period to see, can you live without it? Are you just bullshitting yourself? I'm not addicted. I could quit anytime. How many times have you heard people say that? I could quit anytime I want. Well, do it. They'll never fucking do it. If they do, then you could believe them. But yeah, solitude is great. And yeah, those are some good points, Michael. Anybody else have anything before we.

**Speaker B:** Go? Yeah. I was— hello?

**Speaker A:** Can you hear me? Hi buddy, hi buddy.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, oh, I was wondering about the four Sati Patanas. Like, like, like, could you like summarize like the four.

**Speaker B:** Sati Patanas?

**Speaker A:** Um, I don't know what that is.

**Speaker B:** Maybe Michael can help you out with that.

**Speaker C:** Oh yeah, I got a book on it over here.

**Speaker A:** So, oh nice, oh nice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm familiar.

**Speaker C:** With that. Yes, you just would have to either turn down the volume just so I don't hear.

**Speaker B:** My echo.

**Speaker C:** There we go. Okay, yeah, so the Satipatthana That's the four foundations of mindfulness. That's the body, the feelings, not necessarily the emotions, but I like to think of it as sensation. Then there's the mental states, that's the third, and then the fourth is the word Dhammas, but in this context it means like objects.

**Speaker A:** Of.

**Speaker B:** Mind.

**Speaker C:** And just like feeling, perception, thinking, and consciousness, the four Satipatthanas are just the way that the Buddha phenomenologically categorizes experience. So all of us, without realizing it, unconsciously have a metaphysical belief, right? Which metaphysics is like what's actually there. So most of us unconsciously except that there's like an external physical world, and I'm not saying that there isn't, but the Buddha in his time, just like in Western philosophy, there were debates about whether the universe is made of matter, universe made of mind, right? The Buddha took what we call now the phenomenological position on that, which is like what we know is experience. That's all that we can confirm to be real, is experience. And so he categorized experience in all these different ways, and Satipatthana is one way he categorized experiences, as experience is made up of physicality, feeling, mental states or emotional states, and thoughts or objects of mind. And the process of exploring these of mindfulness, they're sort of like, they're ways of strengthening the faculty of Sati, which is awareness or memory. It's that the body is present and enduring, and the body here is presently enduring dependent on the.

**Speaker A:** Breath.

**Speaker C:** And the feelings that arise, the mental states that arise, arise dependent on the feelings, and the thoughts that arise, arise dependent on the mental states, but not just dependent on each other, but they have an interdependent relationship. Like here we talk about the way Dhammarato talks about the Satipatthana is when the body is relaxed, you feel good. And normally the feelings affect our attitude, but if we have wisdom, we can use attitude to affect our feelings. So it's a way of staying conscious and aware of experience. And what's called experience is to make what's normally unconscious— like we unconsciously walk around in a body, we unconsciously walk around being born into different moods and states of mind, because like maybe we stubbornly create a painful feeling, and that painful feeling leads to a proliferation of angry thoughts and stories, and those angry thoughts and stories lead to a mental state that might last for hours and hours and hours. We're driven around by the Satipatthana unconsciously. So by bringing awareness to it, those foundations of mindfulness, we sort of become conscious of how experience is made, right? Like that show on the History Channel, how it's like the mind is a factory and the raw material of nature comes in and out the other end comes a mental object or state of mind. And if we look downstream, you know, at how it's made and understand how it's made, then we can interrupt the processing of dukkha. I guess you can say we can stop it from producing dukkha and start just experiencing the freedom of knowing how these things work. And there's an analogy I like to use, you know, our ancestors would look up at the sky and the storm would make them afraid. And that feeling was an ignorant feeling of fear. And from that ignorant feeling of fear, they would make up stories about the gods being angry. And then to control that fear about the gods being angry, they would make up rites, rules, and rituals in order to appease the gods. So they're caught in this unconscious, this ignorant pattern of going from fear into stories, into rituals to control the stories and the fears. But as modern science teaches us, a storm arises from a combination of causes. Atmospheric pressure, positive and negative, are different factors. So when we look at a storm now, we no longer see, no longer personify, we no longer self a storm. We understand that arises due to causes and conditions, and therefore we don't feel afraid. So paying attention with wisdom to the Satipatthana, we see that there's no self in the aggregates or the foundations of mindfulness. We see that everything arises due to causes and conditions, that the main characteristic is this dynamic process of change we call Anicca. And that takes the fear, the superstition, the desire out of experience, and it leads to a sense of freedom in it. And so that's the purpose, in summary, of using the foundations of mindfulness. And just the last thing I'll say, not to add too much to it, is that Bhante Punyaji has a different translation. He doesn't call it— he calls it introspection, essentially, that we're focusing attention within. So we're looking at the process of experience rather than sort of being the other end of the factory, like being the product of experience or identifying with the product. Instead of like being the product of experience, like the bad mood, or the good mood, or the bad thought, or the thought. We are looking at the process of experience and understanding it with wisdom. So he says the Satipatthana is looking within, and then Upekkha, what's normally translated with equanimity, is seeing within. And when we see within clearly, then we cannot be— the mind can no longer be conditioned into suffering and delusion.

**Speaker A:** It's a freedom.

**Speaker C:** And when the seeing perception ends. So that's the quickest I could.

**Speaker A:** Summarize it.

**Speaker C:** Nice, nice.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. Anybody else have anything on their mind or any questions they have before we leave? Anybody else?

**Speaker B:** No?

**Speaker A:** Well, it was wonderful seeing you all. Much peace and love, and I hope to see you next Wednesday if possible, 1 o'clock Central Standard Time, or on any of the other various groups we have. Michael has a few groups Dhammarato, sometimes the host changed for those lately, and hopefully he's doing better. It seems like he is. I haven't heard anything since we all heard something last weekend. So yeah, guys, visit Open Sangha Foundation. Continue to make new friends, to be kind and loving to one another and have compassion. And much peace and love. Thank you all so much. Much for joining. Adios, dudes. Bye-bye, dudes.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato and a group of Sangha friends, revolves around a central question from a participant (Ivan): **Can dissatisfaction be useful as a motivator for change (e.g., to clean a messy room)?**

The discussion unfolds into a profound exploration of the core Buddhist teaching of moving from **dissatisfaction (Dukkha) to satisfaction (Sukkha)**. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Teaching: From Dissatisfaction to Satisfaction**
The primary theme is that the essence of the Dhamma is not about using dissatisfaction as fuel, but about cultivating a fundamental **satisfaction independent of conditions**. True freedom and wise action come from this place of inner okay-ness, not from aversion or craving.

*   **The Problem with "Useful" Dissatisfaction:** While dissatisfaction (like a messy room) seems to spark action, it keeps us trapped in the cycle of craving and aversion. Action driven by dissatisfaction is rooted in stress (Dukkha).
*   **The Alternative: Freedom from Satisfaction:** The goal is to develop the skill of being **satisfied with things as they are**. From that place of peace and clarity, you can then make a **free choice** to act (e.g., clean the room) based on wisdom and mindfulness, not on reactive frustration. You act because you see it's beneficial, not because you can't stand the current state.
*   **The Practice is "Chilling Out":** Enlightenment (Nibbana) is framed as "cooling off" or "chilling out." The practice is the "holy alchemy" of turning dissatisfaction into satisfaction, right here and now.

1.  **You Are Already Perfect / A Buddha:** Like plants in a forest, humans in their essential nature are already perfect, peaceful, and empty. Our problems arise from identifying with our transient thoughts, feelings, and stories (Samsara).
2.  **The Real Challenge is Change, Not Awareness:** We are usually aware when we're frustrated. The harder part is **remembering we can change our state** and then actively choosing to do so—letting go and coming back to the breath, to satisfaction.
3.  **Parenting Your Mind with Kindness:** Discipline is reframed not as harshness, but as nurturing, playful habit-building—like kindly potty-training a child. Congratulate yourself when you remember to come back to satisfaction; don't criticize yourself for forgetting.
4.  **Letting Go is the Path:** A Zen saying is quoted: "If you let go a little, you'll have a little peace. If you let go a lot, you'll have a lot of peace. If you let go completely, you'll have complete peace."
5.  **On Worldly Pleasures (Sports, Music):** The group advises against rigid renunciation that leads to resentment. Instead, **enjoy life's pleasures mindfully**. Fully engage (e.g., in a soccer game), but practice letting go completely afterward. As your inner satisfaction deepens, attachment to these external stimulations may naturally fall away. The test is: can you be happy with or without it?
6.  **The Deeper Work: Contemplating Loss:** To uproot clinging, it's valuable to contemplate the loss of what we hold dear (sight, hearing, loved ones). This reveals where our unconscious attachments are and prepares the mind to remain peaceful even as faculties decay.

### **Practical Advice Emphasized**
*   **"Never mind, start again":** When the mind wanders into frustration or story, gently drop it and return to the breath and present-moment satisfaction.
*   **Check-in 6-7 Times a Day:** Periodically ask, "How am I feeling right now?" and guide yourself back to "Everything is okay."
*   **Cultivate Solitude:** Spend time alone without distractions to see what the mind truly needs and where attachments lie.
*   **Focus on Satisfaction First:** The approach taught is to **start with and prioritize satisfaction**, rather than trying to achieve satisfaction through arduous practice. This makes the path beautiful from the beginning.

### **Conclusion**
The talk ultimately encourages a relaxed, joyful, and kind approach to practice. Life is already "good enough." The path is about tending to the mind like a peaceful gardener, weeding out dissatisfaction with a smile, and discovering the freedom and joy that are always already present beneath our stories and struggles.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by the speakers to illustrate their points about dissatisfaction, mindfulness, and Buddhist practice:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The Messy Room:** Used initially by Speaker B and expanded by Speaker A, this is the central metaphor for a **trigger of dissatisfaction**. It represents life's minor frustrations that can either spark desire for change or be met with acceptance. The discussion revolves around how one relates to the "mess" (problems) — with frantic effort or peaceful choice.

2.  **The Gardener / Tending the Mind-Garden:** Speaker A uses this to describe the mindful practice. Weeds (negative thoughts, frustrations) naturally appear, but the practitioner is like a gardener who checks in periodically (6-7 times a day) to gently remove them without stress or constant labor. It frames practice as **nurturing and cultivation**, not frantic weeding.

3.  **Cooling Food (Nibbana):** Speaker A explains the Pali word *Nibbana* (Nirvana) by linking it to its literal meaning: the process of food cooling off. Enlightenment is thus metaphorically **"chilling out"** — a cessation of the "heat" of suffering and dissatisfaction.

4.  **Alchemy:** Speaker A describes the practice as the "holy alchemy of turning lead into gold," meaning **transforming dissatisfaction (dukkha) into satisfaction (sukkha)**.

5.  **The Empty Village:** Referenced by Speaker C, this metaphor from the Buddha teaches that **sensory consciousness is like an empty village**. It’s not where our true identity resides, warning against over-identifying with the fragile and impermanent senses.

6.  **The Factory of the Mind:** Used by Speaker C while explaining the Satipatthana, the mind is compared to a factory. Raw materials (sense impressions) come in, and products (thoughts, moods) come out. Mindfulness is **understanding the production process** to stop manufacturing *dukkha*.

7.  **The Tank That's Already Full:** Speaker C uses this to describe the state of satisfaction. If you are already full of contentment, you don't need to seek external things (like sports wins or sensory pleasures) to fill you up. Practice is about realizing you're **already full**, not about acquisition.

8.  **The Gordian Knot:** Speaker C mentions that Dhammarato's approach "cuts through the Gordian Knot" of practice. Instead of trying to painstakingly untie the knot of suffering through complex methods, the direct path is to **choose satisfaction** right now.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Buddha and the Serial Killer (Angulimāla):** Speaker B briefly references this famous story. The Buddha tells the pursuing killer, "I have already stopped [causing harm]. You stop." This illustrates that **the fundamental change in Dharma is "to stop"** — to cease the frantic mental proliferation and clinging.

2.  **The Perfect Forest:** Speaker A recounts a story (attributed to Alan Watts via another student, Michael) about walking in a forest. We see plants and bushes as perfect, not judging a bush for having "incorrect" roots. This story teaches that **humans, in their natural state, are likewise "perfect"** beyond our labels of good/bad, crazy/normal. Our judgments (likes/dislikes) create the illusion of imperfection.

3.  **Babysitting Two Types of Children:** Speaker A uses this anecdote to contrast mental attitudes.
    *   The **dissatisfied, spoiled child** is like an untrained mind—always wanting more, creating trouble (a "hungry ghost").
    *   The **content child** is like a trained mind—happy with little, peaceful, and easy to be around. The practice is about **re-parenting our own mind** to be like the content child.

4.  **Potty Training with Joy:** Speaker C shares a modern parenting anecdote about potty training his 3-year-old. The approach of using **playfulness, encouragement, and no criticism** is compared to skillfully building new Dharma habits (like breaking addictions). It shows discipline through **joy and nurturing repetition**, not shame or harsh rules.

5.  **The Coworker Losing Her Vision:** Speaker C tells a sobering story about an elderly coworker whose world is collapsing as she loses her eyesight. This serves as a concrete contemplation on **impermanence and clinging to the senses**, urging practitioners to find a satisfaction that doesn't depend on intact faculties.

6.  **The Four Mountains:** Referenced by Speaker C, this is a sutta (scriptural) story where the Buddha describes old age, sickness, death, and the search for truth as four mountains closing in from all directions. It’s a metaphor for the **inescapable pressures of existence** that practice prepares us for.

These metaphors and stories collectively paint a picture of the Dharma as a practical, compassionate, and joyful process of letting go, finding innate satisfaction, and relating wisely to the ever-changing conditions of life.
