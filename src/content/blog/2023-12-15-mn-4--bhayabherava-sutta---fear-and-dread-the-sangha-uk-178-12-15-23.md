### Transcript


**Speaker A:** And then I go back to a wat in Italy, which is awesome wat, for 2 months or so, winter retreat. So that's what I'm doing. So now I can have some time with technology and this.

**Speaker B:** Cool. Yeah, man, it's good to see you again. I started the recording. Yeah, you too. Does anyone mind that I started the recording? Because I can turn it off and we can talk off the records if anyone wants to do that first. But just because we have a good group here, I'm just going to start it right away. All right. All right. Yeah. So welcome everybody who's joined. We have some new members that joined from another Sangha. Another group, Erza, Ezra, and Ben. So welcome to them. And we have DJ, Jesus, and Pietro, longtime friends and Sangha members here. So it really gladdens my mind to see y'all. And it's good to get together here and share the Dharma and practice. And I was just talking about to the newcomers that It's kind of like an informal hangout. To structure it, I'll start reading a sutta, and usually that will spur some insights and some conversations. But anyone is welcome to cut me off or butt in at any moment if they have something they want to share. It's not just me being the guy that everyone's listening to. If anyone else has wisdom that they feel called to share, please feel free to speak your wisdom. So it's open for that. Or if you have questions for me or anyone else here, go ahead. Or if you just want to share something about your practice. But the sutta I picked out for today is one that's very near and dear to me. And I think quite practical and important. It's from the Majjhima Nikaya, and it's only the fourth one. So it's the fourth one in the book, and it's titled Fear and Dread. Right, so fear and dread, the feeling of fear and anxiety and dread. This is one of the main obstacles to practice, to good satisfying practice. Right, where we have been taught and conditioned, and we have learned to be afraid, right? So our body has learned to activate its fight or flight response for no good reason a lot of the times, right? We could be sitting here in a room, completely safe, but there might be a sense of unease or fear present, right? And the chances are is that fear is going to be present if you're not in Jhana, or if you're in any kinds of defilement or unwholesome state, that fear is going to be there no matter what person you are. You could be a macho man, you could be anyone. Hey Pietro, good to see your face. You could be a macho man, you could be anyone. There's always that underlying fear, which is one of the main hindrances that has to be intentionally overcome. But there's a way to intentionally overcome fear. So that's the good news. Okay, so I'll just get right into it reading this. Citta. Take a sip of water. Thus have I heard. On one occasion, the Blessed One was living at Savathi in Jetta's Grove, Anapanasati Park. Then the Brahman Jhana— I'm not even going to try to pronounce that— went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one side and said, Master Gotama, when clansmen have gone forth from home life into homelessness out of faith in Master Gotama, do they have Master Gotama for their leader, their helper, their guide, And do these people follow the example of Master Gotama? This is so, Brahman, that is so. When clansmen have gone forth from the home life into homelessness out of faith in me, they have me for their leader, their helper, and their guide. And these people follow my example. But Master Gotama, remote jungle thicket resting places in the forest are hard to endure. Seclusion is hard to practice. Right? So I think anyone who's tried this has realized this. It's hard to be alone with your thoughts all by yourself, go into meditation, and those Samskaras will come up, right? It's hard to endure. This is the reality of meditation. And it is hard to enjoy solitude. One would think the jungles must rob a Bhikkhu of his mind if he has no concentration. That is so, Brahman, that is so. Remote jungle thicket resting places in the forest are hard to endure. Seclusion is hard to practice, and it is hard to enjoy solitude. One would think the jungles must rob a Bhikkhu of his mind if he has no concentration. All right, so important. If there's no training of your mind, you're going to lose your mind if you're in solitude. All right, so this is why it's important to train the mind. Before my enlightenment, while I was still only an unenlightened Bodhisattva, I too considered thus: remote jungle thicket resting places in the forest are hard to endure. The jungles must rob a Bhikkhu of his mind if he has no concentration. I considered thus: whenever recluses or brahmins, unpurified in bodily conduct, resort to remote jungle thicket resting places, then owing to the defect of their unpurified bodily conduct, these good recluses and Brahmins evoke unwholesome fear and dread. So like the idea is that the fear comes up as a habit of instinctual patterns. So the habits of our minds that have gone on and like been trained through ignorance and before you started practicing meditation will continue when you actually get into seclusion and attempt to practice meditation. But I do not resort to remote jungle thicket resting places in the forest unpurified in bodily conduct. I'm purified in bodily conduct. I resort to remote jungle thicket resting places in the forest as one of the noble ones with bodily conduct purified. So this is important. So it's important to come into your meditation with the right attitude and right mindset, right? So you're entering the meditation with the idea of being noble. So you're on a courageous endeavour to surmount suffering, right? You're doing it for the happiness and welfare of everybody. And this mindset is going to affect the course of your meditation. If you come into the meditation with the wrong mindset, So the mindset of being afraid and being a victim, then that will lead to those kinds of mental spirals that will just snowball effect the fear, right? People are afraid of fear, right? They're afraid. People have anxiety of anxiety. So if we face the fear, We face the fear with the idea that we're noble and we're conquering this fear. And we look at the fear and just be okay with it as it is, okay with it that it's there. In other words, being fearless of fear, even while it's present. This is the way for the fear to be quickly surmounted, right? But it's going to get into that. So it's that this fear is not like not experienced by people who are sincere practitioners. The Buddha experienced the same fear before he was enlightened. But seeing in myself this purity of bodily conduct, I found great solace in dwelling in the forest. So you see the nobility of what you're doing, you see the purity of the meditation. And you will find great joy in the solitude, in the path that you're going down. There's kind of like a courageousness, an inspiration that's brought up. That lets you go through any type of fear or darkness. So like, as I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, right? So as I sit in the forest alone, I fear nothing. And you just go into it with that mindset. Whatever sensations come up in your body, Okay, just look at it. That's what it is. Be not afraid. Be not afraid is the most repeated line in the Bible. Be not afraid. I wonder why it's the most repeated. Okay, but before I continue, I drink a lot of water, so I have to go pee really quick, but I'm going to be right back. All right, feel free to chat while I'm gone.

**Speaker C:** Good to see you guys. Also, DJ, it's been quite a while.

**Speaker B:** It's been a little bit, but yeah, no, glad to see you.

**Speaker C:** How's it going?

**Speaker B:** Well, it's nice to enjoy some sutta time with Scott. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Virjo, you've been busy?

**Speaker B:** Sorry?

**Speaker A:** Are you been busy lately, no?

**Speaker C:** Oh yeah, I started this new school, but like actually when before the call started I was meditating in my bed, so I was already in the mood. And then I remember that we were having the call soon. And so I said, okay, perfect.

**Speaker B:** Wonderful. Thanks for coming, man. Okay, I'll just pick up where I left off there. So I found great solace in dwelling in the forest, right? Man, it feels good to get away from it all, right? Just being alone. There's no disturbances. There's nobody to bother you. Nothing to worry about. The only enemy then becomes your own mind, right? The only fear that's created are mental fears when you're alone. So we'll learn how to deal with these mental fears. So I considered thus, whenever recluses or Brahmins, unpurified unpurified in verbal conduct, unpurified in mental conduct, unpurified in livelihood, resort to remote jungle thicket resting places. They evoke unwholesome fear and dread. But I am purified in livelihood. I resort to remote jungle thickets and resting places in the forest as one of noble ones with livelihood purified. And this is not to bring about any kind of guilt trip Right. But the idea is that not whether you're purified in livelihood in the deep, dark past, but whether you're purified in livelihood right now is what's more important. Right. Are you authentically and sincerely trying to come out of suffering here and now? And if the answer is yes, then you're purified in livelihood. Right. The past is gone. No point in guilting yourself over any past action. So seeing in myself this purity of livelihood, so finding that purity within yourself, that innocence, you find great solace in dwelling in the forest. I consider thus, whenever recluses and brahmins who are covetous and full of lust I am uncovetous. With a mind of ill will, intentions of hate, I have a mind of loving kindness. Overcome by sloth and torpor, I am without sloth and torpor. Overcome with restlessness and unpeaceful mind, I have a peaceful mind. Uncertain and doubting, I have gone beyond doubt. Given to self-praise and disparagement of others, I am not given to self-praise and disparagement of others. Subject to alarm and terror, I am free from trepidation. Desirous of gain and honor and renown, I have few wishes. Lazy and wanting in energy, I am energetic. Unmindful and not fully aware, I am established in mindfulness. Unconcentrated and with straying minds, I am possessed of concentration. I considered thus: whenever recluses or brahmins devoid of wisdom, drivellers, resort to remote jungle thicket resting places in the forest, then owing to the defect of their being devoid of wisdom and drivellers, these good recluses and brahmins evoke unwholesome fear and dread. But I do not resort to remote jungle thicket resting places in the forest devoid of wisdom. A driveler. I am possessed of wisdom. I resort to remote jungle thicket resting places as one of the noble ones possessed of wisdom. Seeing in myself this possession of wisdom, I find great solace dwelling in the forest. So seeing within your own self, your own wisdom, right? Not somebody else's wisdom. Not an outer wisdom of a deity. No, the own wisdom of yourself. The wisdom you had to even want to meditate in the first place, that's your own wisdom. And if you direct the mind towards this wisdom, it grows. So whatever you feed your attention grows, right? So if you feed your attention to doubt, the doubt will grow. If you feed your attention to ill will, intentions of hate, that will grow. If you feed your attention to, oh, I'm so tired, you'll just feel more tired, right? So this is a skill of directing our minds. Here, I'm going to skip a little bit. Okay, so when he goes into seclusion, I thought, what now if this fear and dread coming? I thought, why do I dwell always expecting fear and dread? What if I subdue that fear and dread while keeping that same posture that I am in when it comes up? So this is where the practice happens. So how come this cycle keeps repeating? That's the question we're asking. What now if this fear and dread is coming? Why do you always expect this fear? Right? It's a pattern, you know, we've come to identify with it, we see ourselves as the fear. But why? You know, let's investigate. The root of the problem here. What if I subdue that fear while keeping the same posture that I am in when it comes upon me? While I walked, the fear and dread came upon me. I neither stood nor sat nor lay down till I had subdued that fear and dread. While I stood, the fear and dread came upon me. I I neither walked nor lay down till I have subdued that fear and dread. While I sat, the fear and dread came upon me. I neither walked nor stood nor lay down till I had subdued that fear and dread. While I lay down, the fear and dread came upon me. I neither walked nor stood nor sat down till I had subdued that fear and dread. Right. So instead of doing what the fear and dread wants us to do, right, instead of trying to find, trying to find some relief in the fear and dread with some sort of distraction, right, we sit there until we subdue it completely. I'm not going to do anything else until I get rid of this fear and dread. Right? So this is a pattern breaking. So the pattern of fear will come up. And the normal response to that pattern is more hindrances, right? More fear of the fear. Trying to find an escape from the fear in some sort of sensual gratification, right? Maybe you go to the fridge, try to eat something. But the instruction here is to, no, just sit with the fear and just face it. Face it until it goes away. Don't do— take your stand. Don't do anything else until the fear subsides. And repeatedly do that every time it comes up. You can ask yourself questions. What is there really to be afraid of? What now in this moment is there to be afraid of? There may be a bodily sensation of tension. So fear always just comes in the form of a bodily tension. And we can be afraid of this sensation, or we can take our stand and see it for what it is. And even play around with it a little bit. So you can look directly at the tension, whatever tension there may be in your body. And you'll find once you're no longer afraid of this fear, it will spontaneously vanish on its own accord. Right? So all fear is impermanent. There's no such thing as a permanent fear. Every sensory phenomena is always appearing and disappearing. The only reason it continues is by perpetuating it with your own mind. So if you bring an end to the perpetuation of fear with the activity of your own mind, this this density, this fear, will evaporate. It can't stand the heat of mindfulness. It's like a block of ice, and the awareness, the mindfulness, is like the sun shining down on it. It can— the ice block can last a long time in the shade during the night, During ignorance, during unmindfulness, when you're not paying attention to your body, when you're not paying attention to what's going on, this ice block can last a very long time because the temperatures are right. But it cannot withstand the heat of mindfulness, the heat of the direction of your own awareness. It cannot stand the heat of your own attitude of being a noble practitioner of the Dharma and looking fearlessly at your own experience. This ice block will start to melt, and it will start to evaporate, and it will turn into gas and clouds that vanish in the sky. So you can experientially taste the relief of emptiness of the ice block. Even while it's an ice block, it's still empty. It's just the current form that the water has taken, right? Ice, like all forms of water, ice, vapor, and liquid, it's all the same water. It's just different frequency of water, different density, right? Different energy level. So the sensations, the sensations of fear and the sensations of tension can literally be alchemized you can perform alchemy to transform this same tension into literal Piti and Sukkha. The energy of fear can be experienced as feeling alive, right? You got the heart rate going, you feel alive. Why do people jump out of airplanes? Right? Because they want to feel alive. It's the same adrenaline. It's the same fear. But instead of being averse to it, you're like, yippee, this is fun. There's really no difference, except for the relaxation of the body. Wee! Right? Life is like a roller coaster. Some of us are like freaking out and crying the whole time, and some of us have our hands up and going, "Wee!" and enjoying the ride, right? So you decide whether you're going to be clenched up or with your hands up in the.

**Speaker A:** Air.

**Speaker B:** So, so whatever posture he was in, he didn't change the posture until he subdued that fear and dread. There are Brahmins, some recluses and Brahmins, who perceive day when it is night and night when it is day. All right, so perceive day when it is night. Night when it is day. So not looking at things clearly, not looking at things rationally, making up excuses, making up stories in our mind for the fear, making up stories So coming up with all sorts of delusions that sort of mask the real problem. I say on their part, this is an abiding in delusion. When I perceive, but I perceive night when it is night, and day when it is day. Right, so understanding Dukkha as Dukkha and happiness as happiness. Dukkha Nirodha as Dukkha Nirodha. Understanding ignorance as ignorance and wisdom as wisdom. So being honest with the state you're in. Rightly speaking, were it to be said of anyone, A being not subject to delusion has appeared in the world for the welfare and happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the good welfare and happiness of gods and humans. It is me indeed that, rightly speaking, this should be said. Right, so now it's going to get into the classic description of Jhana. So if you sit and you conquer this fear, you know, for the welfare and happiness of all beings in the universe, right? You have that kind of attitude, you arouse that kind of like gusto, right? You arouse that courageousness. You will get into Jhana. And the description follows suit. Tireless energy was aroused in me. Unremitting mindfulness was established. My body was tranquil and untroubled, my mind concentrated and unified. So energy is aroused, unremitting mindfulness was established, and your body is relaxed and tranquil and untroubled, and your mind comes to a state of collectedness. Of unification. You just— your experience of reality becomes more, more ordered, less chaotic. You experience things one by one as they occur, each breath one by one. When there's not a fear present, when you surmount your own fear, the simplicity of this moment, moment by moment, becomes delicious. Each breath is like a kiss from the universe, a sweet fragrance. And your body and your field of experience can become Suffused with the perfume of peace. Spread out. So when you smell a sweet fragrance, for example, where do you experience that sweetness? So there may be some parts of our experience that are still tense, but that's not interesting to us anymore. What's interesting to us is the parts of our experience that is experiencing that sweetness and that relief. So you begin to bring the mind towards the experience of relief and sweetness. And feed it your attention, and the bitterness will join the party. There's no bitterness that can't be transformed into sweetness. Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, I entered upon and abided in the first Jhana, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. All right, so we get into the state where we're having one thought after another about the Dhamma. Every thought is Dhamma. Everything is okay. There's nothing to worry about. Everything, this body, this life, all of it is impermanent. There's nothing, there's none of it that's worth worrying about or clinging to, and there's no reason to be afraid. Before I continue, is there any questions or any comments, anything anyone like to talk about? I think we're having a good time. Wonderful. Okay, great.

**Speaker A:** It's very difficult to talk with this Buddhist teaching discussion.

**Speaker B:** There's really nothing— that's the thing is that the actual practice is kind of like a conversation ender. All right, because the joy and the peace is more interesting. Than the thoughts. Yeah, that's very difficult to talk, right?

**Speaker A:** It's very, it's very nice how you, how you, how you speak it and everything. It's very nice. Thank you.

**Speaker B:** It's like, yeah, yeah, it's just I'm trying to explain like how to do it, but it's like you can't really explain how to do it. But the transition from first to second Jhana is when those thoughts start to subside and you're just a happy camper and you don't even need to think about it anymore. So quite secluded from With the stilling of the applied and sustained thought, I entered upon and abided in the second Jhana, which has self-confidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. All right, so this is the state that you get into when you're just soaking it all in. And you don't even need to think about it. You've found a safe place to rest. And the mind can finally relax and take a break from trying to figure it out, trying to get something. With the fading away as well of rapture, I abided in equanimity, and mindful and fully aware, still feeling pleasure with the body, I entered upon and abided in the third Jhana, on account of which Noble Ones announce, he has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful. So even just sitting with a smile on your face can evoke Jhana. Just sitting here, just a little smile, you know. Humor is also a good vehicle. It's kind of funny that we're taking things so seriously and being afraid about things, or even wanting certain sensations to go away. Without realizing it's just a sensation. It's not going to bite you. Any bodily sensation you have, like, what harm does it really do to you? It comes and it goes. With abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief, I entered upon and abided in the fourth Jhana, which has neither pain nor pleasure, and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. When my concentration, when my concentrated mind was purified, thus bright, unblemished, rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability. So there's kind of a bright quality of mind that's malleable and wieldy, right? So your hard and fast rules, your hard and fast ideas of self and your hardened and fast preconceptions of things become a little bit more malleable, you know, a little bit more fluid. You stop thinking of things in black and white. You stop thinking of things as the story of me, right? The mind becomes malleable, wieldy. Anything's possible. In our field of experience. Um, and then he like recollects past lives and has like past life experience and all that. Just gonna skip that part. And then, uh, the, uh, eventually the, um, the Jhana evolves into fruition. Ignorance was banished and true knowledge arose. Darkness was banished and light arose, as happens in one who abides diligent, ardent, and resolute. When my concentrated mind was purified, bright, unblemished, rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability. I directed it to knowledge of the destruction of the taints. I directly knew as it actually is, this is suffering. I directly knew as it actually is, this is the origin of suffering. I directly knew as it actually is, this is the cessation of suffering. I directly knew as it actually is, this is the way leading to the cessation of suffering. I directly knew as it actually is, these are the taints. I directly knew as it actually is, this is the origin of the taints. I directly knew as it actually is, this is the cessation of the taints. I directly knew as it actually is, this is the way leading to the cessation of the taints. When I knew and saw thus, my mind was liberated from the taint of sensual desire, from the taint of being, from the taint of ignorance. When it was liberated, there came the knowledge: it is liberated. I directly knew birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what was needed to be done has been done. There is no more coming into any state of being. This was the third true knowledge attained by me in the last watch of the night. Ignorance was banished, true knowledge arose. Darkness was banished and light arose, as happens in one who's diligent, ardent, and resolute. Now, Brahman, you might think, perhaps the recluse Gotama is not free from lust, hate, and delusion even today. Which is why he resorts to remote jungle thicket resting places in the forest. But you should not think thus. It is because I see two benefits that I still resort to remote jungle thicket resting places. I see a pleasant abiding for myself here and now, and I have compassion for future generations. Indeed, it is because Master Gotama is accomplished fully enlightened, that he has compassion for future generations. Magnificent Master Gotama, magnificent Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who is lost, or holding up a lamp in the darkness for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Gautama for refuge and to the Dhamma and the Sangha of Bhikkhus. From today, remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life. Right. That's powerful. There's a way, the way, the truth, and the life out of suffering. And it's all up to your own— it's all up to your own mind and where you direct it. And it takes courage, man. It takes courage to face the fear, to face the Samskaras. But the more you do it, the more enjoyable it becomes. And like, and when it becomes enjoyable, you keep doing it because it's enjoyable. So it doesn't mean that, oh, what, you become enlightened and you don't need to practice meditation anymore, right? If you have success, no, you practice meditation because you enjoy it. It's enjoyable to do. Why would you stop, right? You found a happiness that's not dependent on anything else, and that's rare. To find happiness that's not dependent on the world. You become free of the world and you become— you're like a free man. Before, you're a slave. You're a slave to the world and you're a slave to what people telling you you need to be, what societal constructs of what a happy person is or what a successful person is or what you need to have. You need to have the wife and the 3-car garage and the picket fence, right? But these people, if you look at them, some of them are happy if they practice. But a lot of them are miserable. So you'll see that that's not the answer either. But if you find the answer to happiness, you'll end up losing interest in everything else that you believed would make you happy. And you walk around with a confidence that exudes that peace and tranquility. And it's kind of confusing to people, like, what does that guy have that I don't have? Right? Why is he happy? And it may even make people angry with you, or subconsciously jealous. Are upset with you. And they may even want to poop your party and try to poke your buttons a little bit. And you can see the comedy in that, right? No, that's okay. I'll just go. You can go, go. If you can keep your butt-hurt-ness. No thanks. If you don't take it, then a gift not received is kept by the gift giver, right? You don't take people's bullshit. Yeah, it's very liberating to realize that, wait, we don't have to pick that up. You don't have to pick that up. And you are in complete power and control of your own happiness. No, I don't need people to give me attention to be happy. I got it all within myself, everything I need. You're already something, a teacher of teacher of a teacher of an Advaita teacher said. That's pretty Dhamma. He said, you're already fully equipped for happiness. You've got everything you need. There's nothing external that is needed for happiness. You're already fully equipped. If you're alive, you have the capacity for happiness. Happiness is just the purity of being alive without desire for something else. Other than just that joy of being alive, that, wow, we can really revel in it. Like, I'm alive right now. It's a miracle. I made it this far without dying, right? As Dhammarato always says.

**Speaker A:** Congratulations.

**Speaker B:** Congratulations, man. We're here, we're alive. Woohoo, I'm still breathing. There's no other accomplishment that you need, or there's no other— there's no purpose to life besides being alive itself. We've arrived. This is it. This is the purpose. Here we are.

**Speaker A:** Thank you, man.

**Speaker B:** Congratulations. Yeah, experience that joy. Congratulations. Yeah, experience that joy that you have total access to, that somebody may think they need to win the Super Bowl to experience. Winning the Super Bowl. Yeah, we did it! The fucking confetti popping, the champagne bottles, right? Yeah, you can experience that joy and happiness because you won the cosmic Super Bowl of being alive. Here we are. That's why the translation of the Blessed One really just means like the lucky one. Like, if you stumbled upon this Dharma, consider yourself lucky, you know what I mean? Like, think of yourself as just lucky. Gratitude, right? Just being grateful that how lucky I am.

**Speaker A:** Beautiful. It's beautiful, this feeling of gratefulness.

**Speaker B:** It's beautiful. And like, like, uh, that's why I like— that's why I'm into like, uh, I also appreciate like Christian mysticism and stuff like that, or like anyone who practices just like the awe-inspiring gratitude for God and the presence of God in God's creation, or seeing that God is sending 100 messages every moment. Like, every moment is my mantra. Every experience, every sensation is the angels trumpeting out the victory of God. Wow. All right, so like you can get poetic with it, like, like just really, how good can I feel? All right, brothers, if there's anything else anyone wants to continue, I'm welcome to keep going.

**Speaker A:** Actually, I wanted to share that it's very timely, the fear and dread subject, because I've been in trouble with fear not long ago. I fear I feel that, well, virtue, I mean, I remember virtue and taking refuge in the noble friends being very powerful for this fear. And virtue, for example, like I remember like, I mean, bugs or birds or spiders around me, they were not in danger because I will not gonna harm them. Then I felt like I was not in danger either, you know. It was very helpful. And then Dhammarato told me, 'Remember you have noble friends.' It's like, 'All right, yeah, that's true. Why I forget something like that?'.

**Speaker B:** You know, remember you have what? I'm sorry, I didn't— remember you have what he said?

**Speaker A:** Like noble friends.

**Speaker B:** Like, don't forget you have noble friends. Remember the noble Sangha. Yeah, yeah, like remember your buddies.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that was like, yeah, that was like a kind of refuge.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, it is a refuge to just be grateful for each other. Like, remember your noble brothers that we have here. We all wishing each other well, we're all wishing each other happiness, you know. Like, remember, like, we're all in this, we're all in this together. Like, we're on the same, the same goal to come out of suffering and just be happy. So you have that entire support. This thing is much bigger than just you. You have the entire momentum of the Buddha himself, the Dhamma, and the Sangha perpetuating It's like an unstoppable force of nature. It's a hurricane that will take you over, right? It's an infectious disease that there's no cure for it, and it will infect your mind, and eventually it will become terminal, and there's no going back. All right, friends, good. Thank you very much. I really do love you guys. I love you guys so much, honestly. Thanks for coming.

**Speaker A:** You— me too.

**Speaker B:** It's— yeah, that we have like, uh, we, we've been friends for a while now. It's good to like keep seeing you guys and we're still friends. It's really beautiful. Yeah, so thank you everyone. Thank you. Bye, Pietro. Good to see you, brother.

**Speaker C:** Bye, Jesus. Bye, DJ. See you guys.

**Speaker B:** Bye-bye.

### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk transcript, here is a summary:

**Core Theme:** Overcoming fear and dread (a primary obstacle to meditation) through the cultivation of virtue, mindfulness, and a courageous, noble attitude, ultimately leading to deep meditative states (Jhanas) and liberation.

**Key Points:**

1.  **The Challenge:** Solitude and meditation can be difficult, bringing underlying fears and anxieties to the surface. This is a universal experience, even for the Buddha before his enlightenment.
2.  **The Foundation:** One must enter practice with a "purified" foundation—not a guilt-ridden perfection, but a sincere, present-moment intention of noble bodily, verbal, and mental conduct. This creates a stable base.
3.  **The Method for Fear:**
    *   **Face it Directly:** Instead of avoiding fear through distraction, one should resolve to stay in posture (sitting, standing, etc.) and face the fear until it subsides.
    *   **Change Your Relationship:** Become "fearless of fear." See it as a mere bodily sensation (tension) that is impermanent and empty.
    *   **Alchemize the Energy:** The energetic charge of fear can be transformed into the joyful, alive feeling of *piti* (rapture) by relaxing into it and changing one's attitude from aversion to curiosity or even enjoyment.
4.  **The Role of Attitude:** Cultivate a courageous, noble mindset—seeing yourself as a warrior surmounting suffering for the welfare of all beings. This "gusto" and inspiration are crucial.
5.  **The Result - Jhana:** By subduing fear and directing attention skillfully (away from hindrances and toward relief/pleasure), the mind becomes tranquil, concentrated, and unified. The talk then guides through the classic progression of the four Jhanas, leading to a mind that is "bright, unblemished, malleable, and steady."
6.  **Ultimate Goal:** This purified concentration leads to liberating insight—direct knowledge of the Four Noble Truths and the destruction of the mental taints (sensual desire, becoming, ignorance).
7.  **Support & Joy:**
    *   **Sangha:** Remembering and taking refuge in noble friends and the wider Sangha provides crucial support against fear.
    *   **Gratitude & Joy:** The practice culminates in a self-sufficient happiness and profound gratitude for the "cosmic Super Bowl of being alive." Happiness is an internal capacity, not dependent on external conditions.

**Overall Tone & Approach:** The speaker (Dhammarato) presents the path as joyful, courageous, and accessible. He uses practical metaphors (ice melting in the sun, a roller coaster ride) and emphasizes that the goal is a happiness found here and now, within oneself. The structure was an informal, communal reading and discussion of the "Fear and Dread" sutta (MN 4).

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by Speaker B (the main teacher) to explain the Dhamma and the process of overcoming fear:

### **Metaphors:**

1.  **Fear as an Ice Block:** Fear is compared to a block of ice. Mindfulness and awareness are likened to the sun. The "ice block" of fear can persist in the "shade" of ignorance and unmindfulness, but it cannot withstand the "heat" of direct, fearless awareness. It will melt and evaporate.
    *   *Purpose:* To illustrate that fear is impermanent and dissolves under sustained, correct attention.

2.  **Fear as Water in Different States:** The sensations of fear (tension, adrenaline) are compared to water, which can be ice, liquid, or vapor. The same essential energy can be "alchemized" or transformed from the dense, cold "ice" of fear into the lively, pleasant energy of *piti* (rapture) and *sukkha* (happiness).
    *   *Purpose:* To show that the raw energy of fear is not the problem; our relationship to it and how we "process" it is what matters.

3.  **Life as a Roller Coaster:** The experience of life, with its inevitable ups and downs (fear, excitement), is compared to a roller coaster ride. We can choose to be the person who is "clenched up and crying" (averse) or the one with "hands up going 'Whee!'" (accepting and engaged).
    *   *Purpose:* To emphasize the power of attitude and non-aversion in transforming experience.

4.  **The Dharma as an Infectious Disease/Hurricane:** The path of practice is described as an "unstoppable force of nature," a "hurricane," or an "infectious disease" with no cure. Once it takes hold, it becomes terminal for suffering—there's "no going back."
    *   *Purpose:* To convey the powerful, transformative, and inevitable nature of sincere practice.

5.  **Mind as a Gardener/Feeder:** The mind's attention is compared to a resource that feeds what it focuses on. "Whatever you feed your attention grows." Feeding attention to doubt, ill will, or sloth strengthens those states. Feeding it to wisdom, courage, or relief strengthens those.
    *   *Purpose:* To teach the skill of directing attention intentionally toward wholesome states.

6.  **The "Cosmic Super Bowl":** The simple fact of being alive and aware is compared to winning the biggest prize ("the cosmic Super Bowl"). The joy of that victory—complete with confetti and champagne—is accessible right now through gratitude, not external achievement.
    *   *Purpose:* To invoke a sense of immense luck, gratitude, and immediate access to joy.

### **Stories & References:**

1.  **The Buddha's Story (from the "Fear and Dread" Sutta):** This is the central narrative framework. The speaker recounts the story of the Buddha-to-be facing fear and dread in the jungle before his enlightenment. The key lesson is the Buddha's resolve: he would not change his posture (walking, standing, sitting, lying down) until he had subdued the fear that arose in that posture.
    *   *Purpose:* To provide an authoritative example and method: face fear directly with unwavering resolve, breaking the habitual pattern of seeking distraction or relief.

2.  **The "Valley of the Shadow of Death" (Biblical Reference):** Referencing Psalm 23 ("Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil"), the speaker connects the Buddha's courageous mindset to a universal spiritual principle.
    *   *Purpose:* To bridge traditions and emphasize the timeless, cross-cultural nature of fearless courage in practice.

3.  **"Be Not Afraid" (Biblical Reference):** Noting that "Be not afraid" is the most repeated line in the Bible.
    *   *Purpose:* To reinforce the central, non-negotiable importance of cultivating fearlessness on the spiritual path.

4.  **Skydiving Analogy (Implicit Story):** The speaker references people who jump out of airplanes for the thrill. The physiological arousal (adrenaline, heart rate) is the same as in fear, but the mental attitude—"Yippee, this is fun!"—transforms the experience.
    *   *Purpose:* To illustrate that the bodily sensation is neutral; our interpretation and relaxation around it determine whether it's suffering or aliveness.

5.  **The Story of the Advaita Teacher:** References a teaching from "a teacher of a teacher of an Advaita teacher" who said, "You're already fully equipped for happiness."
    *   *Purpose:* To support the core message that happiness is an internal, innate capacity, not dependent on external conditions.

**Overall Purpose of the Metaphors and Stories:** Speaker B uses these vivid, relatable images and authoritative narratives to make abstract Dhamma concepts (impermanence, right attitude, energy transformation) tangible. They are designed to inspire courage, provide practical models for practice, and shift the listener's perspective from one of victimhood ("fear happens to me") to one of empowered agency ("I can meet and transform fear").
