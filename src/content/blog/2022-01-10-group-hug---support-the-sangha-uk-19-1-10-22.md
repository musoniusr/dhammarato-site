### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Hello, Robert.

**Speaker B:** Rob's here.

**Speaker C:** Hey, Robert.

**Speaker D:** Hey, guys. I found some trouble with my audio again.

**Speaker A:** All right, so Robert, welcome. Uh, David in, uh, New York does not have a practice going, and so I thought that I would take this opportunity to talk in general, uh, to him as if it were new people. Who had no practice and what would be the value of starting a practice. And we've only been using the word practice. We haven't even used the word meditation, but rather just practicing. And the reason that we're talking about practice is actually just practice in general, that any skill that you want to develop requires practice. And that Anapanasati is actually a whole set of skills to be developed. And if we practice those skills, it will be of enormous fruit, of enormous benefit. But you haven't seen that benefit yet. And so you have to practice just a little bit to get a little bit of benefit. And then after you see that there is great benefit possible by practicing and developing the skills further, there's also a kind of a dark side to it in the sense that what we're actually doing is learning how to investigate the mind in order to clean it out. So you can imagine someone saying, well, I'm finally going to— for some reason, I'm going to maybe turn the basement into a den or something. But in order to make the place into a den or a comfortable home or a place like that, we've got to clean the basement out. And there has been junk in the basement for years, perhaps even some dead bodies and some things to regret and remorse and things we want to hide and whatnot like that. And so going into the basement to clean that place out is often a difficult chore for some people because they don't like what they find. When their original intention was just to clean things out. Or another way of expressing it is, this is a line drawing of a cartoon that's quite valuable here, and it's a picture of a guy standing in a swamp or in a pond, and he's surrounded by alligators, and he's up to his waist in it. And the caption on this is, when you're up to your hips in alligators, it's hard to remember your original intention was to drain the swamp. So if you go into the swamp to drain it, you're going to wind up with some alligators. And that's one of the reasons why many people will become discouraged in the practice, is because they don't like what they see. And it's better for them just to forget all about it. So with that warning, we can say that, oh, but if you are capable of draining the swamp and getting rid of the alligators, or you're capable of cleaning out the basement so we can turn it into a den or a second living room, then it's going to be of enormous value. And so this is part of the way that we can have with these analogies of why it's a good idea to start to practice. But in this case, what we're doing is, is that we're developing a small set of skills. We can go so far as to say 4 foundation skills, and when those skills develop, we use those to build other skills. And so those four foundational skills, the number one skill on the list is what we call Sati. It's become almost part of American lore, or at least in Western Buddhism, the word is mindfulness is what they use. Have you ever heard that word mindfulness before?

**Speaker D:** Yes.

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** OK. All right. Here's the problem with mindfulness is that it only— what mindfulness really is down at its basic core is to remember or to wake up, to remember to be in the present moment, to not be thinking about something that's off someplace else, but to be here in the present moment. That's what we mean by Sati, is to remember to look at what's going on. And that's a skill that very few people ever develop very well. And so they don't have the value And a way that we can think of it is, is that— have you ever heard of Murphy's Law?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I've heard of it. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Do you know it?

**Speaker C:** Is it anything that can happen will happen?

**Speaker A:** Is that anything that can go wrong will go wrong? But— and that's the first half of it. The second half is the most important part. And that is, is that anything that can go wrong will go wrong and it will go wrong at the worst possible time. Examples of that is, when do rockets blow up? Do they blow up while they're being manufactured? Do they blow up after they're already in space, or do they blow up at launch time when they're most critical, when they're stressed the most? That's when they blow up. Another example is a hotel, a new hotel that's got 1,000 rooms, and they get a computer system that is guaranteed for 1,000 rooms. When is that computer system going to break? Is it going to break on opening night? Is it going to break in a long time? Is it going to break just at the time when the hotel is absolutely full, 100%, every room is booked? That's the most likely time for that computer to go down because it's being really, really worked hard and stressed. Okay, so this is what we mean by it. And what we want Sati for is we want it to be available when we need it the most. Just when things are about to go wrong, that's when we need it. And so this is the first skill that we develop, and we do that by watching the breath. With every in-breath, we practice a little bit of Sati. Hey, Joe! And with every out-breath, We practice a little Sati in the sense of remembering to take a long, deep breath and remembering to take a long, deep out-breath. And we begin to slow the breathing down and start to relax with that. And as we breathe in long and remember to breathe in long and to breathe out long and remember to be breathing out long, we also remember is to kind of be here in this present moment with that breath. I mean, we can't have a mindfulness of a breath from a breath that we took last year or a breath that we're going to have, let us say, the day we die. No, the only breath that we can really be aware of or paying any attention to is the one that we're having right now. And that's the most valuable part of this entire practice, is to literally be here in the present moment. So that we can be there, wakeful, so that when shit happens, we can handily— we can deal with it easily. That's because, as you know, when you don't deal with things handily and happily, it winds up being quite a mess. So many times people have a whole life that has a lot of mess in it. That we can call that emotions. Or in the Pali word we have for it is Dukkha, which means that we're just not really satisfied, that something messed up and we weren't there to be on guard to make sure that we didn't go bonkers and feel bad because something messed up. Because things are going to go south, everything's going to mess up. Rocket's going to get launched, rockets are going to blow up, people are going to miscommunicate with each other, all kinds of problems can happen. The question is, are you going to be mindful enough to be able to handle that thing very well? Which comes to the second set of skills. But if you don't have that first skill, the other skills are not important. Here's what I mean by that. Imagine that someone is a karate champion. He's an old, old grandmaster. And he's just strutting down the street in Chinatown, and all of a sudden these young thugs come out, you know, like in the Wild West. They're going to try to beat up the old grandmaster just so that they can get a reputation for it, right? They're willing to get hurt in order to get that reputation. Now, if that grandmaster forgets his moves, his karate skills, he's defenseless against those guys. But if he remembers exactly what to do with it, he can handle them well. And so what we're really talking about here is in fact a kind of a martial art, except that it's a mental martial art. And the one that it sounds closest to is what you would call jiu-jitsu. Have you ever heard of jiu-jitsu? Yeah, yeah, everybody knows jiu-jitsu. It means actually the 'ju' in it has the word for in Japanese to be soft. And so what we're looking for is to remember to take the easy way out, to remember to take it easy. That's really what this is all about, is don't make problems, because it's easier to live if you're not living with problems. But we have to remember to not make problems. Because we're constantly making problems. And when we're out there making problems, Murphy's Law is going to be there. Things that can go wrong are going to go wrong. And so we got to be ready for it. And so this is the reason for practicing Anapanasati, which actually means— the Sati is to remember to breathe. Anapanasati, isn't that interesting? That's what it actually— the word actually means, is means to remember to breathe. Mindfulness of breathing, watching the breath, noting the breath. And as we do that, we'd start to develop another skill, and that is the skill of observation, the skill of looking. In the Pali, they talk about it as right view, but many people think that means a constructed view, like a worldview or an idea or a way of thinking. But really, right noble view actually means right noble looking, investigating, noting what's there in the mind, because what we're actually going to be looking for is any problems or worries or frustrations or doubts or any of that kind of stuff that's actually in the mind that would hinder us from being in a really great state. And so we call those things hindrances. And so we're going to be mindful to pay attention or to note or to look or to investigate. Is this thought that I'm having right now worth having? Oftentimes the thoughts that we're having are really not even worth having. In fact, we even make ourselves feel bad because we're thinking about something that happened in the past that we can't fix. But when we reminisce about it, we feel bad, and there's no reason to feel bad because our bad feelings are not going to fix anything. In fact, our bad feelings is generally what makes even worse things happen, because now we're working really hard to get out of our bad feelings that we actually talked ourselves into. So once we make this investigation and find out that this thing is not worth thinking about, then we can immediately just throw that out and start having thoughts that are worth having. Thoughts that are worth listening to, thoughts of this present moment, thoughts about how nice things are, thoughts about everything's okay, everything is fine, no worries, no problems. And as we practice this, we begin to feel like we can do it. We feel like a champion. We feel like we're on top of the world. We feel like that, oh, Murphy, bring him on. I'm ready for you. I can handle anything. And so these are actually 4 skills that we develop, which is right view, right Sati, right effort, and right attitude. So the right effort is to change the mind, which is— remember we were talking about cleaning out the basement? Once we define that thing that we don't like and needs to be taken out, that's the effort that it takes, is to take that thing out of our mental basement. Throw it out, don't need that. It's just an old, old memory, probably a painful old memory. Why bring them up and have old painful memories? Let's take the easy way out and have some good, happy new memories. And so that's basically an easy way to talk about how we do our practice. And so I would invite Joe and Robert and Brandon to comment upon this.

**Speaker B:** He's speaking gold.

**Speaker A:** Robert, what do you have to say? Yeah, that's it.

**Speaker D:** You just breathe deep and enjoy.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:DHAMMARATO] Yes, so this is actually the art of being happy. The art of— actually, it's an art in the sense that art is a skill. That's an important quality of art, is that art is at its highest quality when it's quite skillful, which means that we have to practice. Whether that art is the art of music or dance or painting or photography or Zen archery or whatever art form that you're using, it takes some practice. Another way of saying that practice is that each one of us, every one of us, has spent our whole lives talking ourselves into feeling bad, giving ourselves problems and work to do, failures, disgust, making enemies, wanting things we can't have. So we've been talking ourselves into feeling bad. Having a bunch of rules we can't follow. Now we're going to practice feeling good, actually feeling. We're going to talk ourselves into feeling good. You can feel good, can't you? I mean, you know how, don't you, David?

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Notice that everybody right now is smiling. But no, oh, now we gotta smile out of you. All right, that's where we're going, is that we can in fact talk ourselves into feeling good. That's what jokes are all about. I mean, why would he even have a stand-up comedian or a President or someone like that, if he wasn't hilarious?

**Speaker E:** [Speaker:DAMARATO] A President!

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:LYNDON] Yeah, we don't need, let us say, an effective President, we need one that's hilarious! And so we can begin to have a hilarious life. We can begin to have some rhythm and some rhyme and some beat and some music, because normally what our lives are is kind of like noise. It's kind of scattered. Things are just kind of all over the place. I got to do this, I got to do that, my to-do list is long. All right, and so we live our lives like that. But when we practice this way over and over again, something kind of happens, and that is that we begin to get our whole life and our whole mind more organized. We begin to get into a rhythm because we're practicing over and over again of coming out of our bad feelings, coming into a feeling of really nice. We become and feel satisfied with life as opposed to wanting things and feeling dissatisfied. And so it becomes kind of a rhythm. So that your life becomes kind of a music, and everything is satisfying, and everything is easygoing, and your memory improves because now you begin to collect jokes that you want to tell yourself to cheer yourself up. You become your own stand-up comedian, and you begin to love life because it's a good thing. And here we are, I've been using all of our time and effort and energy talking ourselves into feeling bad because that's how we were taught when kids. If you were around really happy people when you were a little kid, then you'd be a really happy little kid too, and then you would grow up as a happy adult. But for some reason, we are all blessed with unhappy parents, and we pick up that unhappiness from them. We watch them, you know, kind of— you heard about monkey see, monkey do. So we imitate bad feelings, we imitate taking on rules, we want to go along to get along, and so we learn a whole bunch of rules that we don't actually match up to. Most of the rules we have are standards that we can't even meet, and so we go around feeling like a failure a lot of the time because we don't match up to our own set of rules or boundaries. Which causes suffering. And so I offer you a new perspective, and that is, let's have one good rule, and that is this rule of the Buddha: the Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Let's see when things are unsatisfying and throw that out and have something satisfying instead. If we keep that rule, we'll be able to manage the world's rules easily by just having that one rule. But mostly we have a whole bunch of rules that we can't live up to, and when we don't live up to them, we feel bad, we feel like a failure. So this is what mindfulness is all about, is to begin to inspect those rules that we've made for ourselves that we can't keep and begin to feel really good about the fact that, hey, I don't have to follow that rule right now. I can just sit here and relax. I don't have to go anyplace. I don't have to do anything. I don't have to write that email. I don't have to tell my mother off. I don't have to stab my dad in the back. I don't have to do any of that kind of stuff. I can just sit here and chill. But in fact, going to Brandon, that's what that word Nibbana actually means. It means just to chill. So we have little Nibbana for everyone. And you can practice that. You can practice just sitting and chilling out. I mean, we all like to just sit and chill, but we don't make an intentional habit of it. And so that's what the practice is, is a practice of actually intentionally sitting down and intentionally chilling out. And guess what? You get pretty good at it after a while. Yeah, there old Robert is just chilling.

**Speaker D:** Feels good.

**Speaker A:** So anytime. Yeah, you can do it anytime. You take the breath with you. You never leave the house without it.

**Speaker E:** Sometimes I find that we can separate in our minds like our practice versus regular life and forget that you can just live your whole life of practicing, and that's kind of like the goal.

**Speaker A:** Well, David, what do you think?

**Speaker C:** I think that's great. I think there's a lot of great points and wisdom, everything you just said.

**Speaker A:** Well, I invite you to give it a go. Do some practice. Check it out.

**Speaker B:** Take a— as we're talking, just start noticing a little bit that you can take a long, easy in-breath and then a long, easy out-breath. And the more you do that, the more you realize you can manage that while you're doing just about anything in life. And then you have mindfulness instilled into anything you're doing almost, or really everything if you get pretty good at it. And that can transform stuff in a way that is rather surprising. And it can do it pretty quick, especially if you've been practicing doing bad meditation forever. You've developed a little bit of the skill. Skills to learn how to take the easy road pretty quick and easy.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's right. Go ahead, David.

**Speaker D:** I was just going to say, now just instead of taking suffering as your object, just take the joy as your object. Take all the good aspects of experience as the object instead of a mix of good and bad. Forget about the bad stuff.

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm. Yes, we do take the object of meditation of whatever is in the mind, but we do that with discernment. So in fact, going back to the analogy of the basement, when we're cleaning out the basement, we don't want to rip up the stairs down to the basement first. That would be a pretty stupid thing to do. We have to actually be careful about how we're doing things or looking at it. But yes, what happens with Western meditation generally is that they get focused on the Dukkha by just saying, look at just whatever is there. Well, if we don't actually clean the place out, then wherever we look, in other words, every time we go into the basement, if we haven't done the job of cleaning it out, it's just going to be the same old garbage. And so what we're really going to do then is that we're only going to look at this piece of garbage enough to say this is garbage, and then out it goes, up the stairs and out to the rubbish tip. And once we do that and keep doing that over and over again, guess what? The basement gets pretty well cleaned out, and now we can enjoy the basement without all the garbage in it. That's the difference between the actual teaching of the Buddha and what is normally known as Mahasi Method that's quite popular in the United States and the West, is that they don't take the right effort to throw this stuff out and what we call gladden the mind or take wholesome objects in the mind to come into the present moment and find something really nice about this present moment. So that we can become satisfied, coming out of our dissatisfaction. See, if we only just see Dukkha, Dukkha, Dukkha, Dukkha, we're going to continuously just be dissatisfied. In fact, if we develop the skill of Sati so that we keep looking at the Dukkha and keep looking at the Dukkha and keep looking at the Dukkha, our whole life winds up being just a rubbish tip. Everywhere we look, we see that. And in fact, that's something that happens with the beginning meditators a lot. So that they begin to meditate and all they can see is their frustrations. And so they become frustrated about their frustrations. They don't like it. OK, and that the right effort is to say, never mind, start again. Never mind that this is a pile of rubbish. Out it goes.

**Speaker E:** Another thing that I notice in myself is like really high expectations, and sometimes I forget that I'm making the rules for myself. So then my meditation becomes another

**Speaker C:** like

**Speaker E:** place that I'm setting rules for myself. And so that is like the new unwholesome thought that I have to notice. For instance, this morning I was laying in bed and I woke up a little bit late and I started beating myself up mentally like, oh, you should be meditating. What about your practice? And then that's the unwholesome thought to see, right? It's like, yeah. And then I was like, okay, well, never mind. Just forget the meditation. They have their Dharma group, so just join that and see how things go.

**Speaker B:** So yeah, hey, I've been wanting to use this, this joke that, that Rob gave to me. Uh, we don't use hard Rs here. We don't want— we don't use hard Rs here. It's Dhamma.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, Dhamma. It's because I've been in Plum Village for so long and they always say Dharma in Plum Village.

**Speaker B:** But yeah, it's just a little Dharma, Dhamma joke. Yeah, nothing to worry about. Throw it out.

**Speaker A:** Oh, the R, right? Yeah, there we go. A little R. Yeah, I got it.

**Speaker E:** Yeah,

**Speaker B:** that hard R. They sound horrible, don't they?

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] So David, we were also going to discuss this issue about what is Nibbana, because there's actually a hard form of Nibbana. That's when it becomes a goal, rather than the soft kind of Nibbana, which everybody has from time to time. I mean, if you didn't ever relax, then you probably would, you know, die early, or Anagami have a disease or suicide or something strange, that we often, like every day, have a little bit of relaxation, a little bit of Nibbana. We cool off a little bit every day. Then in fact, one of the ways to say it is, is that you could not even go to sleep. You couldn't sleep itself if you could not have a Nibbana. Eventually the mind stops. Enough worrying about tomorrow so that we actually can get some rest and peace and go to sleep. So another way of looking at that is, is that when someone doesn't bother themselves all day long with all of these mental and emotional fires, if they're cool all day, then they don't need so much sleep at night. For the repair. That in fact, people begin to sleep very, very lightly when they've got nothing heavy on their mind. Makes sense, doesn't it? And so this is what we're talking about, this word Nibbana, or the hard word is Nirvana. And that And that it becomes hard because it becomes a goal, to where the reality of Nibbana is cooling off, not the work of heating it up. That in fact, the original word itself was used in two contexts in the time of the Buddha, and so he grabbed this word to use it as an example for what he was talking about. And we do that in our language too, in the sense of we have these words like cool down or chill, baby, or cool. Okay. These are the kind of words that we're talking about. And so that's how the word was used in the time of the Buddha and that the reference was for animals, that when an animal Nibbana, that means that it's becoming domesticated. For instance, the dogs are not hot. Because they're not barking at strangers. They're not chasing traffic. Okay, they're cool. And the other one is cooking food, that when food is cooked, right when it comes off of the stove, it's hot and it's unfit for eating. That's especially true with pizza. Have you ever burned your mouth because you ate food that was too hot? You want to get it out. Or maybe you swallow it and then you burn in the inside too. Okay. So what we mean by that is, is that we want to wait before we chew and digest things to let it cool off.

**Speaker B:** Don't be a hungry ghost for the pizza, right?

**Speaker A:** Don't be so hungry, because when we are hungry, then we're willing to wolf anything down no matter what condition it's in, rather than waiting for it to cool off. And so when somebody feeds you a really hot word like imbecile or bully or whatever words that you get hot because they use that word on you, before you devour it, savor it a little bit. Don't let it in, let it cool off. In other words, it does not have to have that heat for us to feel bad. Another way of looking at it is, is, yeah, we can let it just slide right back. Well, that wasn't me. You can't touch me because there's not much me here for you to hit. And so that's also a quality of the cooling off, is that whatever it is, the me in there that gets hot is not important anymore. And so things are not important enough to get hot about. And so one of the ways that we can talk about it that actually is anti, let us say, society, not antisocial, but that society doesn't like it when we talk about that the teachings of the Buddha brings us to a way of taking the easy way out. In all situations. We just take the easy way out, but that's a skill. You have to be highly skilled to be able to play dodgeball so that you just happen to just move just enough out of the way so that they don't touch you. Or another way of talking about it, mental jiu-jitsu, that we don't resist, we don't try to block the, uh, the attack, we just kind of step aside and let them fall on the floor. All on their own. And so this is what we mean by Nibbana, is let things just cool off. We don't have to get stuck with that hot arrow or the slings and arrows of outrageous fortunes. We're really fortunate because all the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune miss me. They miss the target. There's nobody there to hit. And so this is a way of learning to dance. This is another way of talking about the Dharma, is learning how to dance. And what is the dance that we do? The dance of avoiding getting hit by anything, including our own mind and our own thoughts. And so we learn to be cool. Now, in Western Buddhism, there is a whole quality of trying to make this an attainment or work, to make things hot, to strive. In fact, part of the last thing that the Buddha said is translated into, it's up to you guys now, therefore strive diligently. But the Pali itself doesn't have the word strive in it, or even diligence. This has to do with be persistent, do it over and over again, practice it regularly, over and over and over again. So it's persistence, easy persistence, that we're looking for, not working really hard, striving, trying to get something, and then relaxing because we give up. Then go back and doing it really hard again for a little while and then giving up. That's what Western meditation seems to be, especially when they're trying to sit for long periods of time. Rather, it's better just to do it for a short period of time, as often as you can remember to do it. That's the real practice of the Buddha. And how we want to do that is by getting away from it all. To find a quiet place. We can close our eyes even if we're sitting on the bus. We don't have to work with the other passengers or anything like that, or worry about what we're going to do when we get to work or anything like that. We can just sit there and chill, just sit there and remember, hey, right now it's just great. Everything is nice, everything is wonderful. And so this is the way that we want to practice, is the skill of doing it over and over and over again. And just chilling out and having a nice moment. Brandon, now let's talk about Nibbana. What did you— we've talked about the soft part. You tell us about the hard part.

**Speaker B:** Well, I'd love to talk about the hard part, and I'm rather curious what your view of where this might have come from in the suttas, or maybe where someone threw it in as on top of the suttas. Maybe it wasn't there in the first place, I don't know.

**Speaker A:** But the answer to that easily is every one of us comes to the easy Dhamma with our hard efforts. Every one of us. Makes that mistake, and it's been happening for centuries. I know when the same mistake is repeated over and over and over again, you can see that it becomes part of the tradition.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so the hard Nibbana is, uh, well, a good person who I learned about the hard Nibbana from was Daniel Ingram. And he talks a lot about it.

**Speaker A:** Um, one thing, look how hard he tried though. You got to give him credit for that.

**Speaker B:** Well, I will say, uh, you know, Daniel definitely gave it, uh, a lot of effort. Um, for sure. Um, I commend him 100% on his effort.

**Speaker A:** Um, guess what? That's exactly what the Buddha did. Before he became enlightened, he was trying everything. He tried the Jhanas, and he tried austerities, and he was starving himself, and he was doing all kinds of spiritual practices, and he was the absolute best at it. He really, really strived hard. And then he recognized, hey, why don't I just sit down and enjoy myself instead?

**Speaker E:** Well, from what I understand of hearing you talk about your own biography, Dhammarato, is that you have had periods of striving as well at various times.

**Speaker B:** Yes, well, he said we all come to the easy path by doing it a really hard way.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, one of the ways of actually thinking about it is, is imagine that we're lost in the wilderness or the forest or whatever like that, And way off in the distance, we hear a train whistle. But we're lost. We're in the real wilderness with hills and trees and bears and all kinds of stuff. But way off in the distance, we hear a train whistle. And so we start making the effort to get there, and we wind up finding the railroad tracks, and we recognize that, oh, the railroad station is only just a short walk from here. And so now we walk to the railroad station. And we sit down and we rest and wait for the train to come. And when the train comes by, we get on board. Now we got an easy, you know, taking it easy. We're on the easy train. That's the way of looking at it, is that we are all stumbling around without the path or without the transportation. Now, in the time of the Buddha, we didn't have trains, but what they did have is the idea of the path. Here we are stumbling around in the wilderness. Lost, can't find our way around, everything is dangerous. And then we stumble across a footpath. What are we going to do with that footpath? Obviously we're going to follow that footpath. But the question is, are we going to follow it uphill, are we going to follow it downhill? Which, Brandon, are we going to choose? Why is it that we always occasionally—

**Speaker B:** but the downhill is pretty fun. Once you get going with it. You just got to make sure not to go too quick on how easy it gets.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's right, because we have to stay on the path. If we just start rolling downhill, we'll wind up hitting into a tree. And that happens with meditators a lot. They think that they've got it good, and then they'll have an accident or something. Never mind, pick yourself up, dust yourself off, Get back on the path, keep following it. That's all we have to do. But there are times of disasters. But that question is an interesting one, because why is it that everybody that we meet is on the uphill path? And so we think that because everybody else is on the uphill path, that's the uphill path that we should take to take to, you know, I mean, they talk about hill climbing and Nibbana being a high place and all of that. So the natural idea is that we got to go uphill. Gotta work really hard at it.

**Speaker E:** Well, I think there's also a culture associated with hearing the story of the Buddha and then trying to replicate his life. And I know that this happens like specifically with the Goenka tradition where they emphasize like someday you're gonna have to be able to sit through the night just like the Buddha. So you better be able to physically do it when that moment comes. And then there becomes this massive emphasis on like really long sits there and a lot of striving. And it's sort of like, I struggled to get to where I'm at, so you should do it too, even though maybe like you don't really have to do that, you know. But it tends to come through the culture a little bit, I find, in the meditation community. And the friends that I've met along the way.

**Speaker A:** I know, I've been there, done that. I spent 3 years with Goenka, 1980 through 1983, in and out. So I know, I know about the striving. Been there, done that. And, uh, it was when I got to Bhikkhu Buddhadasa when I found out what really the practice was all about. It wasn't about striving at all. Is about chilling out. So that's why I would recommend the Nibbana book, which is basically, if anyone is already practicing Anapanasati or practicing meditation, generally when they call, they're practicing by going uphill. And so my job is now easy. They've already got the path. All I have to do is just tell them to turn around. Come on down here, that's all there is to it. Take the easy way out. And point out that that's exactly what the suttas are specifying. But we have to understand how to read them. That's in fact what I got from Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, is how to read the suttas so that we could come to the understanding that the Buddha really did take the easy way out. And so the sitting up all night is not striving. It's just that that's what they did back then. Then, in fact, you sat up all night before. You did it because you were interested in doing something. But when is meditation sitting in hard postures that you're not used to? That in fact, in the suttas where it says— and there's many of the suttas, in fact, is both in the Anapanasati Sutta and also also in the Kayanupassana Sutta, which really goes in great depth about the jhanas with analogies and all that kind of stuff. They both start with that little phrase of go to the forest, to a foot of a tree, to an empty hut, to a pile of straw, and sit down upright and mindfully establish breathing in and breathing out. That's how the whole thing starts, right? Except that in these English translations, it always puts in the phrase cross-legged. The Pali does not have the word cross-legged. It has the word couch. It has the word couch or chair. It says to sit down, but it doesn't say cross-legged. That cross-legged is in fact what people would naturally do if they their lives sitting on the ground or on the floor, and they do still do that even in common times today in the tropics. It's only in northern climates where people want to get off the floor into furniture. And so at the age of 2, we're picked up off the floor and put into a high chair for our meals. The Thai kids, they eat on the floor their whole lives. I got a stepdaughter that I first met when she was 11 years old, and now she's 19. So I've known her all of these years, and she eats every meal sitting in the lotus posture. You know that posture where all the Westerners lust and strive for? She's just doing it naturally. She does it her whole life. It's a very stable posture to sit in. Many times you can sit in the lotus posture, and they can also sit in a sideways posture that's even more difficult for Westerners to get into because they don't have the flexibility at the hip level. And so the problem is not being able to sit up all night, it's to sit up all night in a posture that you're not familiar or comfortable with. And so I actually trained to get into the lotus posture. I could sit in the lotus posture for an hour or so at one time, and then the leg got broken and piece of steel got put in, and I can still get into the lotus posture, but it's painful. And there's no reason to sit in the lotus posture. I could just say, been there, done that, and now I can take the easy way out. Why should I keep trying to prove that I can sit in the lotus posture when it's a painful thing to do? Well, it was painful in the beginning, but I called— that was the thing that I should be doing. I should be able to sit in those postures. Yeah, I worked really hard at it. Now I don't work any hard anymore, but I found where the train tracks were finally, and not stumbling around in, uh, our own mental wilderness of working too hard to find our way around. That the path is there, it's an old path. By the way, the Buddha even says that it's an old path that he just merely rediscovered. The way of thinking about it is people like Eckhart Tolle. He found that path on his own. He just kind of stumbled across it. But when it came time for him to start teaching about what he had been able to do, he has to read Buddhist books to figure out what happened. And so the path is possible. People can figure it out. Generally, they're artisans. Who do it, just to figure out how to take life easy by not giving ourselves hassles, not giving ourselves jobs that we don't need. And we're constantly doing that because we've got standards, you know. Well, why have standards? Standards— I mean, here's one of the things about standards is that if you have a standard, you're not always going to meet up to it. If you don't meet up to it, then you're what? You're a failure, and that's not a good feeling. So if we have standards that we can't meet, that means that we have kind of a built-in mechanism for feeling bad. But if we are actually friends with ourselves and don't hold standards or don't hold ourselves critically and think of ourselves in a critical way and judging ourselves, what we think of ourselves in fact is the best friend that we nurture. And so these are the kind of wholesome thoughts. Unwholesome thoughts would be thoughts of antagonistic, thoughts of failure, thoughts of striving, thoughts of wanting something that we don't have. It's better just to feel nurtured, just easy. Everything's all right. So we nurture ourselves, and when we nurture ourselves, then we feel nurtured. Here's an example. The guy and the girl are spending a week or two together because they have the time, but the time is now over and the girl has to go off to go to her job or something like that. And the guy was enjoying his friendship with the girl. So when she left, now he starts to miss her and he starts to pine for her and feel bad. Anagami, an Arahant. How many of you have ever experienced anything like that? Right. We lose something that we had and we don't like it. All right. But the reality is, is that if he has thoughts about her in Thai language, they have the phrase. We don't say miss you. We say been thinking about you. Kitthun kun is the Thai phrase. I've been thinking about you. Now that been thinking about you is actually a pleasurable way. So you can actually think of the girlfriend who is gone with the thoughts of, wow, I really enjoyed it when she was here. That in fact, when she was here and doing what she was doing, the guy felt good because he liked what she was doing. But in fact, he was making himself feel good when she was there. Now that she's— he's not there, he thinks that it was her that made him feel good, where in fact it was he that decided to feel good. And when you understand it like that, you can say, oh well, when she goes, I can sit here and think about her and remember that, yeah, I can think about her and feel good right now. I don't have to miss her. I can think about her fondly and enjoy it. Now, isn't that a whole lot easier than to work ourselves into worry? I miss her. I need her. She's abandoned me. I can't live without her. I mean, those are the kinds of thoughts and words that we have when we get all tied up with it. I need her, I want her, I can't live without her. We even put that kind of stuff into songs and make it romantic music, where in fact that's not really romantic. Being romantic means that, oh, I really remember her fondly, I like I don't have to pine for missing something because I've still got the memories right here. And so let's have wholesome thoughts about her rather than unwholesome thoughts of missing her and wanting her to be back. That I can handle myself. I've made myself feel good while she was here. I got along without her before I met her. I can get along without her now. That's the new song we're going to sing. I can handle that. I don't have to miss her. I can be okay without her. I can feel good about it when I remember her. That's how she would want us to remember. I mean, does the girl actually want you to pine for her and want her and cling to her and try to force her to come back to you just so you can feel good? But she's got other business to do. She wants to be off someplace else. She left. Let her go. She doesn't want to come back. If she did, she will. And if she— and if she— and if she finds you comfortable, happy, relaxed, and glad to see her, then she'll want to come back. If you're pining for her and want her very badly, she's going to react to that differently. So it's a matter then, in this example, of we create our own reality. By wanting something that we don't have when we're fine without her right now. So this is the way that we practice. We practice so that when those thoughts of pining and wanting and thinking about her and missing her, when those thoughts come up, we have Sati. Ah, look at what I'm doing! I don't have to have those kind of thoughts. I can throw those things right out and I can just be happy right now. I can have joyful thoughts about her, not missing kind of thoughts. Joe, you look like you're on the verge of a comment. Oh, I did? Yeah, you're sitting there, yeah, doing this.

**Speaker B:** Oh no, I mean, you gotta say

**Speaker E:** something just because I relate to it, just because I got divorced like 2 months ago, so I can relate to this this feeling. So yeah.

**Speaker A:** Oh, this one struck home, huh?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** You don't have to think about her like that. You don't have to miss her. You got along without her before you met her. You can get along without her now. Yeah, you'll be okay. You'll be fine.

**Speaker D:** I have a question. Yes, if you have time. Um, when I do the, um, the gladdening the mind technique, when I'm doing Anapanasati, um, sorry, I'm just thinking how to phrase it. Um, I, I normally have like two different, uh, modes that like I'll go into, and one is like I feel better than I did before, but there's like this really strong feeling of effort and resistance of trying to suppress all the all the negative thoughts and sensations and stuff.

**Speaker A:** That's the overwork. That's the over-effort.

**Speaker D:** And then the other is like, I'll be just a bit sad and I'll feel more relaxed and more chilled. There won't be the hot resistance, so it'll be more chill, but it'll be a bit sad and melancholy. And I'll sort of go between those, but my mind never sorts to naturally rest on like a still, like I guess middle ground, or it doesn't, it's very hard for my mind to like just find somewhere to just naturally rest for any more than just like a brief moment where it is just like, just like a nice sort of perfected kind of peace.

**Speaker A:** Okay. In the beginning you can expect that, that The beginning, we talked about 4 skills. These 4 skills that we've got going here are together to build a new skill. And that new skill, we can phrase it as getting into a really good state. When you practice all 4 of these together, they become in combination a new kind of skill. And that skill is to chill. Okay. Now, getting into that state is the practice for the beginner. Getting into it, getting into it, getting into it. Why? Because we know it's going to be very temporary, but at least we got into it. That's the important thing, is being able to get into it over and over again. And in the suttas, this is called the first skill of Jhana, or the first skill of chilling, is to be able to get into it. And so we want to practice getting into it over and over and over and over and over and over again. Well, if we just got into it and stayed in it, then we wouldn't be able to develop the skill to being able to get into it quickly and easily.

**Speaker D:** Right. Okay. Yeah. So I'm always, I'm always having to like rebuild my car again.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the skill that we're trying to develop. And so congratulate yourself for giving yourself yet another opportunity to chill again. Okay. Yes, it's not a matter of getting cold and getting colder and getting colder and getting colder. That's not the skill that we're developing. The skill that we're developing is is to see that we're hot and chill, just a little. You know, we're looking for refrigeration temperature, not deep freeze.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And just chill.

**Speaker B:** Freeze is a goal.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, refrigerator is easy.

**Speaker D:** So is it just, is it just practice then? Just repeated practice again and again and

**Speaker A:** again and eventually again and again and again? Well, here's the next point. No, actually, the second skill to be developed then is to sustain it. You probably heard that phrase applied and sustained thought. OK, the applying, it means to get into it, to keep getting into it and to keep getting into it. And that's the first skill. And then the second skill is once you've got it, Can you maintain it just a little bit longer than you normally would? Then instead of 3 or 4 or 10 mind moments, now you can get it up to 20 mind moments. You get it last for 2 seconds or 3 seconds now. And then we do it again and it lasts for a short time and then we fall out of it and then we remember and then we do it again. And this is the cycle that we want to get into. This is a very wholesome cycle to get into because that's the cycle of developing the skill of getting into it and the new practice of learning to maintain it so that these two twin skills together, over practicing many, many times over and over and over again, it gets us the ability to be able to get into it fairly easy and maintain it for a little while, which is a really excellent place to get.

**Speaker D:** Yeah. Should I practice it all day or should I take breaks?

**Speaker A:** Um, actually, I wouldn't say take a break, but rather to let it be finished in the sense that now you're going to start paying attention to something else. Okay, like going to the car and opening the door and getting into the car and that kind of stuff. Okay, so there's going to be things to do The question is, can if the mind becomes unwholesome with an unwholesome thought, can you maintain mindfulness or can you bring it back up when you need it? An example of that is that you finish with your meditation, you get up, you go into the car, you get the key, you put the key in, the car won't start. Now, how do you feel?

**Speaker D:** Right. Yeah. Yeah. So it's when it's when something comes up that we take the opportunity to practice. But if I'm already if I'm already okay enough, then I can just like go about my day and be a normal person. I don't have to practice in the background.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right. But guess what? Cars don't start, toes get stumped, people shout at each other. 10,000 things a day possible for you to trip over and fall down on and feel bad. And as we develop the skill of checking that out, recognizing, hey, I don't have to feel that way, and I can change it, and I can come back and feel good over and over and over again and get into the rhythm then of checking it out and coming back and taking a deep breath. Wow, I don't have to write that email right now. Why am I dwelling over— oh, I gotta write that email. I know, dear Mr. Blah Blah, I hate your guts and I want you to die. No, I don't want to write that. Hello, Mr. Good Man, I like you very much, but— and then I go in, I want you to die. And then I can say, wait a minute, I'm not writing that email. I'm no place close to the computer. Let me just forget the whole thing. Ah, and I'm out of it now, and he is not in my mind, and he's gone. And what a relief it is. I don't have to write that email, not right now. And maybe when it's time to write that email, I can have that same thought. I don't have to write that email, not right now. And pretty soon we can just say, well, it never was a problem anyway. I never did have to tell the guy off, and he wouldn't go do what I wanted him to do. He's not going to go hang himself or do any of that stuff, so why should I bother telling him? I could just chill instead.

**Speaker D:** Um, I have one more question just about effort, which is sometimes it feels like it takes so much effort to do the technique that the end result is I actually feel worse than if I just let like the negative thoughts and emotions be there. Or not thoughts, because I guess you can just disbelieve that as soon as you notice it.

**Speaker A:** Learn also to be satisfied with the thoughts that are there rather than labeling them and pounding them into the shape of they're not good enough.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, that's what I mean with like the really hot resistance feeling. It's like I'm trying to keep it all out so that my mind stays free of hindrances, but that can make so much effort that it's actually like less enjoyable than just feeling like a little bit miserable or a little bit bored.

**Speaker A:** Or— okay, so one of the ways that we can do that then is, you've heard this story of with someone who has only one tool, that's a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, now basically what that means is that he's got that hammer out looking for nails so that he can pound them. Whether it's actually a nail or not. Okay. What we would rather perhaps practice is to kind of be on standby, to be very, very alert to, is this actually a real nail or not? That's the way to do it. Is this thought worth having or not? Is this a nail in my coffin or is this a wholesome thought?

**Speaker B:** But does this attitude apply to the mindfulness of the in and out breath too, or is it just to the thoughts?

**Speaker A:** Both. But in fact, they work together. And it's best when they work together.

**Speaker B:** So when the bad thoughts arise, then you return to the breath and then throw the bad thoughts out. But you don't have to be focusing on the breath all day to develop the skill, because that was really helpful for me. Like, I was spending— like, I watched

**Speaker C:** the

**Speaker B:** video that you have on your channel as like the first one when you go to your channel about practicing at work. And I started just maintaining mindfulness on the breath all day at work, and it was making everything so easy. I just wanted to do it all day anyway.

**Speaker A:** Like, right, so long as you want to do it all day and it's easy anyway. But when you start to have frustration and resistance to it, recognize that and take the easy way out again would be the correct practice. The wrong practice would be striving really hard to maintain mindfulness of the breathing when you're not really getting anything out of it. You're in fact training in an unwholesome skill at that level.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I see. So if it's easy, that we're really

**Speaker A:** looking for satisfaction, but if it's horrible,

**Speaker B:** you know, there's no need to force yourself to keep the mindfulness on it.

**Speaker A:** Right. That's a rule, isn't it? Which— but that's not the instruction. The instructions is, is that never mind, start again. Not you got to keep doing it and you got to keep doing it and you got to keep doing it. That's not the instructions. The instructions are start again. Start again when you remember to start again when you remember. That's the first and important skill that we need to develop. And part of that never mind, start again is actually forgiving ourselves for having just screwed up by losing track of their breath. Yeah, Joe, go ahead.

**Speaker E:** So what I find with myself specifically with some of the emotions that you're talking about, Robert, is I'll notice that there's a resistance there. And what will end up happening is I'll sort of say to myself, oh no, how long is this going to last? Oh, here's this emotion again. Oh God, I'm going to be stuck in this for a really long time. And then it's sort of like I'm talking myself into it a little bit and not really noticing that it's actually not that uncomfortable in my body to feel a little bit, you know, whatever, like whatever difficult emotion is coming up, frustration. That it's kind of okay. This is why I think Dhammarato says, you know, hello darkness, my old friend, because it's just there again. And it's a different way of thinking about it when a lot of times you've trained yourself to like, no, not this again, like, because we know it's going to come again. That's just how it is, you know. But you can welcome it And if you look at your actual reality, most of the time you're actually in a really safe space. And also the Buddha recommends a lot of things like just changing positions, you know, just doing something else, going and sweeping the floor. Sometimes that can be enough instead of just focusing so much on it and hoping that that's going to be the way to do it. He gives, in one of his suttas, he gives like 5 different ways of dealing with it, and that's the one that I find really helpful, is like, hey, just go outside and go for a walk, uh, go start sweeping the floor, see what happens then, you know. Uh, and yeah, that's just my little tip there, uh, for that. But it sounds, it sounds to me what happens for me too is like not being satisfied with where I'm at right now and not actually seeing my reality of like like, oh wow, I have a really nice house, I'm well fed, I'm living in a super rich country, everything's pretty awesome.

**Speaker D:** You get like so tunnel visioned on like the small negative sensations and emotions.

**Speaker E:** And we think it only happens to us too. We think that it doesn't happen to anybody else. That's the main thing.

**Speaker A:** And yet we would have never learned it if it hadn't been happening to the people around us. Yes, David.

**Speaker C:** I have a question. So most of my life, I feel like I was repressing a lot of depression and anxiety. And when I acknowledged those feelings later on in life, I actually tried to acknowledge those emotions more. But because I repressed those emotions for such a long time, when I do acknowledge those emotions, I can't seem to handle those emotions, and those emotions tend to come in long periods of waves, even through mindfulness. What do you recommend me to do then?

**Speaker A:** Well, actually, this is exactly what you're talking about, is very, very much related to Robert. And what he's talking about, except that your time duration or frequency is longer and his is shorter because he's had a lot of practice. But it's still exactly the same thing, and that a key ingredient that is often really helpful is to recognize back to the original teaching of the Buddha of Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Is what I'm doing right now satisfying or not? Even if we ask that question even to our practice, even to our meditation practice, is this enjoyable right now or not? And if it's not, go do something else. Make a change. May need to be a change in posture. But basically the big change that's actually needed is a change in attitude or a change in thought, and that part of that has to do with the waking up that the deep breathing has available for it. And so we can always see every one of these items as a friend. There's no enemies here. We only have friends, even the bad feelings, because we've had them before and we've hated them before and treated these bad feelings as enemies. Which means that we're in the process of creating enemies that are trying to do us in. Let us have whatever it is that's happening. Let's call it a mistake or a blunder or whatever, and we can treat that also as a friend. It's a training tool, or it's a lesson to be learned. And if we treat it with friendship and curiosity, we can inspect it with the idea that I can be finished with that. One of the ways that I like to say it is, is that every toy that we play with, if you play with it well and often, you'll break it. Every toy breaks. And so if we have our bad feelings or our confusion, our doubts, our frustrations, our worries, whatever like that, if we turn them into toys and play with them, They'll break, they'll change, they'll take on a modification. But if we keep treating them the same way that we've always treated— push them away, don't exercise it— and it stays pristine and we never get it finished. It's like keeping the basement dirty rather than saying, hey, I mean, this is just an old memory, it's just an old piece of junk there, let play with it and throw it out. Yes, Robert.

**Speaker D:** Yeah. So regarding what you were just saying, is it sort of like with your method where we have the gladdening step as opposed to like the usual method of you, like the Mahasi method, you just be mindful and you just let whatever's there be there? With your method, it's like you're introducing this trial and error process. Is that what you mean when you're playing with the toy? Is it like like you feel there's some suffering and so you, instead of doing the same thing again and again of just being mindful of it, you change your approach a little bit and adjust to try and see if you can sort of minimize the suffering in that experience. And that's like what playing with it is?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker D:** Like it's like a trial and error thing? You're just like figuring it out?

**Speaker A:** One thing though that I would have to mention is that even though I have a lot of my own experience and have had a lot of teachers, It is part of the, let us say, intentional way of doing things is that I'm not teaching my method. This is the teaching of the Buddha. It's in the suttas like that, that I have become partially skilled in the suttas, not for my own practice. But so that I can make sure that what I'm teaching the students actually is the practice of the Buddha.

**Speaker D:** That's it. It's not your method. Sorry, sorry, I'm phrasing it that way. That's just like how I think about it because you're the first person to introduce me to it, so that's I guess why I think about it like that. My apologies.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it really doesn't belong to me. I freely give it. If you want it, it's your method, not mine, because it actually is your method anyway in that regard.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I guess so.

**Speaker A:** I'm just, I'm just, uh, kind of showing you your natural method anyhow, which is just to chill. You know how to chill. You don't need instructions on how to chill. All you need is the, the skill to remember to chill.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, and the rest is like figuring it out. We remember it. And then, okay, now I'm mindful, just like figure it out.

**Speaker A:** Yes, Joe.

**Speaker E:** I was just going to comment that I've had a lot of other teachers in the past, and a lot of them have very, very similar teachings because it is the teaching of the Buddha, you know, and it might be worded differently, but you'll find it in many, many different traditions and many, many different teachers. Expressed in essentially the same way. And it's really helpful sometimes because you can— like Dhammarato says, he's like, you hear the same thing, but I have to say it in like 100 different ways for it to eventually change in your mind. But just to know that, yeah, there's— I mean, there's a lot of teachers that do that. I think it's just because sort of the hardcore Dharma community on the internet has such a strong voice that you can forget that. Yeah, but because I haven't really been involved in that community at all, I can kind of see it, you know. Yeah, so I mean, I haven't really been involved in that at all, but I've seen it. And so yeah, there's that. And then I just wanted to comment on what Dai Li said about like it feeling overwhelming. So I mean, I've been in that position too. And sometimes to see the silliness of the situation, as hard as it is in that moment, but to really see, wow, I'm really talking myself into not being able to leave my bed right now. You know, like I'm completely safe and secure. Isn't this so ridiculous that I'm a grown man and I'm laying here in bed? And I can't get myself to do anything. This is so ridiculous. Why don't I just get up? Like, you know, and like, it's hard to— it's easy to say it right now, but like, there might be a moment where that clicks, you know, and you're like, wait a minute, this is so ridiculous. Like, there's nothing physically wrong with me. Uh, it's— I'm perfectly fine. How the heck can my thoughts make me so paralyzed? Well, wait a minute, my thoughts can also make me be so energized and so joyful and so, yeah, just easy to live life too. If they have the power to do this, they have the power to do that also. It's just we've been training ourselves for a long time to do the other thing that you're talking about.

**Speaker A:** So actually, that's great, Joe. And following along with that, back to Robert, I think, Robert, you can also see that many, many people talk about being overwhelmed or this is too much, that they need to take a break from meditation and whatnot like this. All right. Actually, the key is not that they're overwhelmed. Let us put it this way. Imagine that there is a bookcase that's full of books. That's not actually 100% stable, and it's easy for the toddler to help climb up so that he can stand up by using that bookshelf as a steadying case to help him to stand up. And in the process, he pulls the bookcase over on top of himself. OK, and now he's overwhelmed by the fact that he has put him himself in a position that the bookcase has fallen on top of him. We often do that with our own emotions. And so the invitation is to recognize that it's not that you're overwhelmed, it's that you wanted something, and that the overwhelming is how much you want it, and the frustration is because you're not getting that which you want. And so one of the ways of stopping the practice of that kind of meditation practice is to say, right, wait a minute, I don't have to want anything. I can just chill right now. Or the way that the Zen folk talk about it is enlightenment. You're already enlightened. Don't want anything right now and you'll be okay.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I think one of the things I noticed while you were saying that and a few other things before was that a lot of that, um, a lot of that resistance and that overwhelm came from like being afraid of like the next thought that wasn't here yet. So I had to be like, I gotta stay mindful so I'm like ready for the next one when it's arriving. But I can— but I think Joe or Brandon, or you said something earlier that, that clicked, and I've just been processing it a bit, where like I, I don't have to be waiting for the next thought. I can just become mindful now, never mind start again. And I've already started again. Now I can just chill. And if I go unconscious again because I'm not like holding myself super steady on my object, like that's fine because never mind, start again.

**Speaker A:** Right. Be gentle on yourself. Right.

**Speaker D:** Yeah. It's just another approach to do that.

**Speaker A:** Well, here's the secret. You are going to, like everyone else, everyone screws up. What that means is, is that we set standards for ourselves that we can't keep. And when we don't keep that standard, we are breaking a rule, we think. And then the breaking of the rule is bad and we feel bad. The reality is, is that we set our standards often too high. And Robert, you're the kind of guy that's going to set yourself really strong, high standards. And then feel bad because you can't make them.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, that's exactly the kind of person I am.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly. And so what we can do instead, by remembering to do instead, is to nurture yourself in the sense that everything is okay, everything is fine, there's no worries. And this reminds me of a Zen story of the Zen student coming into the meditation hall, sneaking his way up not to disturb the teacher. And when he gets in front of the teacher, he asks in a soft voice, 'Teacher, teacher, are you meditating to become enlightened?' The old man took a deep breath and opened one eye, just taking it easy, and says, 'No, I'm just sitting here because I am enlightened.' So that's the way to do it, is just to sit here because you've already gotten everything. You don't need anything now. You're completely satisfied and comfortable. You're already lightweight. There's nothing heavy right now. That's what enlightenment is all about, is that you just let things be light. They're not heavy. Yes, David.

**Speaker C:** Uh, what if,

**Speaker B:** uh, we go out

**Speaker C:** into the world and, you know, people expect a certain standard of us, and when we don't meet those criteria, then we get scrutiny for it, or, uh, whatnot?

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** well, if that happens, you have a choice. About are you going to feel bad and go along with them and say, yeah, your rules are right and correct and I did screw up, poor me, let me suck your behind, or something like that. That's the one. I mean, we have to apologize and say I'm sorry and all of that kind of stuff. But the question is, are you going to be sorry when you say sorry? Maybe it's even a good idea to just say I apologize. I recognize that you're suffering because I've broken your rule, but we can be friends anyway. That's another way of apologizing, is to give the guy his due, because he's wanting something, and so you satisfy that which he needs, but you don't have to feel bad. If you can remember that you don't have to feel bad. But you see, we've been practicing our whole lives that we're supposed to feel bad when we break the rule. But if we feel bad when we break a rule, then one of the ways that we can get out of it is by denying that we broke a rule. And by going into denial, we're actually now creating an additional problem. One, we broke the rule, and two, we're lying to ourselves about it. And we try to hide the truth. We don't want The facts come out because the facts are that we've broken a rule, and by doing so, we screwed up. And so we go into denial. But if we can think of that wrongdoing that we did as just another learning opportunity, just an old friend to come say, and then we can learn something from it. And by learning from it, we can improve. But if we deny that it was a break— and let us say that someone gets angry, and somebody mentions, "Oh, don't be so angry," and he says, "I'm not angry, I'm just talking loud," when we deny our anger, that means that we don't have a chance of actually witnessing it, feeling what anger feels like, taking a deep breath and letting it go. So people who are denying they're angry when they're angry will remain angry. Those who admit that they're angry, they can get over it. Over it really easy because it's not bad. If it's bad, then, uh, we'll stay in it because we're denying that we're in it rather than being able to get over it. So this is part of the investigation, so that we can investigate. But we have to investigate knowing that when we go down into that basement, we're going to find a lot of crap. There's going to be a lot of crap in there. And that's okay. We're going to be able to see it for what it is, enjoy the memories of it, etc., like that, and then haul it out to the road. Don't need it anymore. Throw it out of the mind. So this is the way of practicing. But most people will get stuck on that, that they'll— in their investigation, they'll run across something and they'll feel really bad about it. And then they call that meditation practice. Robert's an expert at doing that.

**Speaker E:** In relation to this, Dhammarato, if we're in that angry state of mind and we're aware that we're angry and the other person is standing there saying, why are you angry? There's nothing to be angry about. You feel like there is something that you're a little bit upset about. Yeah, I'm just wondering if you can comment on that, because I really noticed when you said that I know I do that. I know I do the— I'm not angry, but I am actually angry because I'm trying to avoid conflict. I'm afraid of— So you're layering the

**Speaker B:** denial on top of it.

**Speaker E:** That, right? Uh-huh, right. Okay, I guess that is— we were

**Speaker A:** taught to do that. Yeah, our dads hid his anger from us, and he wasn't very good at it, was he?

**Speaker E:** My dad— I mean, my dad never got angry. It was my mom that was the—

**Speaker B:** so he was good at hiding it then?

**Speaker A:** He didn't?

**Speaker E:** No, my— I mean, like, no, he— no, my dad, seriously, he— I never— I remember him getting angry like one time as a child, and that was it. I don't know, like when Dhammarato was saying, oh, we've been raised by our parents a certain way, like luckily I had one parent that was just like, I don't know, he like, he was

**Speaker B:** just happy all the time.

**Speaker E:** And every, and everybody like that lived in our neighborhood knew him as the happy guy. That's just how he was.

**Speaker B:** So well, I was really like your dad more. Don't listen to us.

**Speaker E:** Well, he unfortunately, he had a head injury and he's disabled now.

**Speaker A:** Oh, a limb.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well, can he be happily disabled?

**Speaker E:** Oh, he's very happy disabled. Actually, he's one of the most happy

**Speaker A:** people in the world. I can't think of a better thing to happen to a happy guy than to be disabled. That way he's got a perfect excuse. Oh, he doesn't have to do anything, he's disabled.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, he says that all the time actually. You ask him like, you ask him what his favorite You ask him what his favorite season is, and he's like, "I like all seasons." That's just how he is. It's amazing, really. He's an amazing guy.

**Speaker A:** That's great. So that's the way that we can think of it then, is to just let everything be easy, that we don't have to strive to get anything from meditation because actually you've already got what you need, that this is not an additive practice. We're not trying to gain anything. We're trying to get rid of the garbage. That's what we're doing. And so we work really hard because we think we're attaining something. And so we have to be mindful of every breath, every breath. Oh, I've got to really do this really hard, rather than saying, hey, when I remember, I can just relax. All I have to do is remember and then I can relax. I don't have to be on super guard all the time. I just need to be on guard just when I need it the most. Be ready for it. Go ahead, Robert.

**Speaker D:** I really like what you're saying here, and I've been practicing the approach pretty much exclusively for the time being, because I only have so much energy to put towards meditation. I want to make sure it's what's giving me the most results, which is what you've been teaching me. But I'm just wondering, how does this practice lead to insights like no-self. So like having like no ego and this sort of thing.

**Speaker A:** Um, actually, let's not go into a great deal of detail about the definitions of the words and ego and all of that kind of stuff, and instead we'll just substitute the word selfishness because that's easy enough for us to see. That when we are selfish, we act selfishly, we behave selfishly. Many, many examples of that. For example, you've got a good friend or a brother who comes to borrow a small but significant amount of money, say $500 or $1,000. Normally, the first thing that we have to think is, no, I'm not going to give him that money. That's selfishness right there. No, I'm not going to give him what he needs because I need it. That's the selfishness there. But we fail to have the wisdom and the insight right then to recognize, if I say no to him, both of us feel bad. If I give him the money and I'm generous to him, then that gives us both the opportunity right now to feel good. And we don't have to worry about him repaying the debt right now. That's not right now. Right now, the question is, does he get what he needs? And am I going to be gleeful and joyfully happy in helping him get what he needs, or am I going to compound his misery and let him give me some of it back by being selfish? When we see that, then we recognize that's what happens. That's what selfishness always is, is that we're trying to cling to something as it belongs to me, where in fact we would, by giving it away, be able to create generosity and create gratitude and create good feelings, which is what we really want from our resources of money anyway. And here we are, by clinging to that money, actually creating the exact opposite of the use of the value of money.

**Speaker D:** Okay, but so the— but the self is like still here, like it won't like We wouldn't like— well, it's not here.

**Speaker A:** Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Let's not do Hinduism right now. It's not that it's still here, it that it comes back,

**Speaker D:** right? Right.

**Speaker A:** It returns. It just keeps coming over and over again, a new opportunity to practice. Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't. Sometimes we're selfish, sometimes we're not. Sometimes we don't get what we want, sometimes we do. When we don't get what we want, or when we are selfish, that's the point in time that we really need to be mindful, so that we can take a wise way out that winds up being joyful and valuable for everyone, rather than being selfish and causing ourselves and other people trouble.

**Speaker D:** Right. I just mean, because like, even when I do the technique, like correctly, like right now, I feel probably like this is like the best application of the technique that I've done in a really long time. Like I feel really good. But I still have like my same sense of self. It's the exact same. Like I still feel like just me.

**Speaker A:** So it hasn't like— That's okay. You're good. I mean, yeah, it's fine. You're already okay.

**Speaker D:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Don't look for anything special. Just enjoy how you are right now. If you can enjoy how you are right now, you're building the skill of enjoying how you are right now. Or if you're developing the skill of satisfaction, that skill will grow so that you become more and more satisfied. That's the technique. That's the trick, is that the skills will develop if you're practicing that skill.

**Speaker B:** I have something to say, uh, in regards to this. I would recommend, since I know you quite well, Rob, to continue with this practice. And maybe one day when you're just exploding with happiness all the time, then you can go apply all the effort you want to the dry insight kind of stuff. And then you can feel like you're the sound of your air conditioner and your foot it and the glass in front of you if that's what you want to do. But for now, being happier is probably going to help you out a lot more than that experience. And being someone who's had similar experiences like that, I will tell you that they are dissatisfying in the end, because what you really want is to be happy and feel okay throughout the day. And just because you feel your sense of self to be dispersed between a bunch of different sensations doesn't necessarily make you smile all the time.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, but I was just wondering— this

**Speaker B:** technique can do that.

**Speaker D:** Oh, it can? Okay. It just takes a long time.

**Speaker A:** Uh, well, no, no, no, right now.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, it can. It doesn't, it doesn't take a long time because that's our, that's our mind that sort of of is like putting it into a category of like, if I just do this long enough, like a video game, and I level up, you know?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. When we recognize that this is so dead easy, it's the easiest thing to do is to drop your garbage. That's the easy way out. Just drop it.

**Speaker B:** A way to think about it is Sure, you can think about it as a video game and you're gaining experience as you go along, but really think about it from the perspective of Mario or whatever, whatever video game character you want. He's about to, in his perspective, he's about to get a gold coin. Oh, and then in another second he gets another gold coin. Oh, and then another. And all you ever have is that second where you can either choose to get a gold coin or not. And the more you choose the wise option to just be happy with the skills that you've developed to the best of your ability, as long as you're not overstressing yourself, the more you get those gold coins of just a little bit of satisfaction here and there, then you'll be able to get them even easier.

**Speaker A:** But in fact, the important point is

**Speaker B:** to get it right now. And not to make it a struggle to get it right now too.

**Speaker A:** But in fact, that struggle is the fact that we— there's no gold coins in sight.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you, you've, you have that negative mindset that, oh man, get— becoming happy is the hardest thing in the world right now. I can't do it, it sucks. Life's horrible, but there's a gold coin like an inch away from you if you just look at things the right way and use the techniques.

**Speaker A:** Taking that right noble attitude. Exactly. Just looking at it from the right perspective. Hey, I can handle this. Exactly. No gold coin? I'm all right. I didn't get a gold coin before and I was okay. I'm not getting one now. Okay. I don't need that gold coin. Yep. Oh, there's a gold coin! Oh, there it is. Yeah, it only comes when you don't need it, I guess.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's how a lot of good things in life work— when you're not chasing.

**Speaker A:** When you're not chasing. That's the best way to catch a cat, by the way. The best way to catch a cat is by not chasing it. For me, it was always sitting down on the floor and putting a piece of sheet music out right in front of me. Guaranteed that cat's going to come lay on that sheet music.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, good point. Yeah, I guess nowadays it would be like a keyboard.

**Speaker E:** I think it's hard to remember to like put effort into not striving. That that's a skill to be like repeated over and over again. And just this sense of like striving, not being satisfied, you know.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, and it's like I noticed it's like subtler and subtler. Like I'll get over like the really gross striving that's really like, like it's really obviously painful. But like even now I can feel like there's like subtle like striving to like do things It's like, oh, and

**Speaker A:** then say, yeah, I can see it. It's okay. You were fine when you didn't see it. You're fine now that you can. You're in fact, you're a little better off now that you can see it. Just a little bit of striving in there.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah. I get the dopamine hit because I just saw it. And that's like a good application of mindfulness.

**Speaker A:** That's the change in attitude, is that when we see the strife, when we see the Dukkha, when we see the mistake, when we see the reprehensible thoughts and deeds, normally we feel bad because we've broken a rule. We set a standard that we can't keep. And to change out of the critical mind of not fixing up to the rules and coming to yourself in the sense of nurturing, like a mother nurtures an infant. Mothers do not expect anything from that infant other than an occasional pee-pee, and after a couple of days, a great big whopping yellow turd. But that's— and she's very happy when that child leaves that yellow Now fast forward 16 years later, and if he leaves one of those things in the front room, everybody's going to be very angry. Why? Because now they're critical of him. But when he was a new babe, we were very nurturing. Anything he does is okay. Wow, let's just have such a ball. We really enjoy having a baby around, even if we do have to change his diapers. Okay. So think about your mind like that also. Treat yourself like a tender infant, and everything you do is okay. That big whopping yellow turd is a prize, needs to be looked at and investigated, and out it goes. So think of every thought like that. Every thought is like a Brand new yellow turd, the first edition from a brand new infant. Treasure it. Wow, what a rotten turd that is. How'd it go?

**Speaker D:** At least my baby's healthy.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, he's healthy. That's the whole point. That's the whole point of— yeah, he finally took a crap. That means he's healthy. That's just the state of being human. Why do we keep fussing at ourselves for taking a dump when that's just such a natural thing to do. We make mistakes, we screw up all the time. Giving ourselves the benefit of the doubt, basically, or just being able to nurture your way into practice. That if anything, David, the real practice is the practice to remember to nurture ourselves when we're screwed up. That it's okay that we're screwed up. That's fine. I can be satisfied screwed up. And that's really hard because we got in such a bad habit of, oh no, I'm screwed up, I've been down to death, you know, and we go off into all kinds of bad feelings rather than, hey, I got you, I see that. Joe.

**Speaker E:** So just relating to what Dhammarato was saying about viewing ourselves as an infant, sometimes I see this in myself, this comparison, especially between like different practitioners or something that I've read. And to just remember that like we also were like a little kid at one point, like staring at somebody else who had like a better bike. For me, I grew up in a working-class family and I never had a new bike. Bike, and it was always like looking at another kid and like, I really want that super nice new GT bicycle, you know. And the same thing happens with meditation sometimes, especially if you're reading people's descriptions of different states and things like that, because people can get really colorful, colorful language. And in my experience, it's not really like that for me, it never has been. Maybe they experience things different than I do, or maybe they just emphasize certain points.

**Speaker A:** Maybe they're preparing that experience for print.

**Speaker E:** Right, exactly. Yeah, and they're sitting there and like, how should I change this wording around? How should I do this? And then you end up reading it

**Speaker A:** and you're like— How can I make you really jealous? This might

**Speaker E:** make them really jealous. And there's a huge thing with this in the online Dharma community of like describing it like as crazy as possible, you know. And like, I don't know, I mean, you can take like psychedelics and your reality can be really crazy, and then you come back to reality and you're like, wait a Everything's still normal. And the same thing sort of happens with meditation. That like, I mean, maybe you have a little bit of a weird experience and then you go to a teacher and tell them about it and they're like, "So what? How are you right now?" "Been there, done that." Dhammarato usually says, "Been there, done that."

**Speaker A:** Exactly, exactly. Yes, always back to the present moment. And the present moment right now, guys. I mean, just look around. Things are right marvelous right now. Things are okay. There's not a problem, not a care in the world.

**Speaker B:** Wait a second, the SWAT's at my door. Dhammarato, let me be—

**Speaker A:** Well, David, what do you think about this? You've been kind of quiet.

**Speaker C:** I'm just trying to really soak everything in, and I'm actually a big fan of your channel, your YouTube channel, and I've watched some of your videos before, so it feels kind of surreal to actually be in this call with all of you guys. And yeah, I just really want to soak in the moments. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's good. It really is great for us to do this in small groups because we really do help each other. And one of the really important benefits is for us to recognize that we're all in the same boat together, that we're not an individual that has unique problems, that everybody has frustrations. And everybody starts to meditate and they wind up getting even more frustrated because they want something to be different.

**Speaker D:** That was my experience.

**Speaker E:** Dhammarato, I had one more question. I had one more question about what we talked about last time. It's just a brief one. So you mentioned like noticing the in-breath and that there's a lot of mind moments, and during those mind moments you can notice your Sukkha and your Piti. And I'm just wondering should you be like verbalizing it, or should it be more of a, like, just a general feeling, or that you're inclining your mind in a certain direction to notice in between the in-breath and the out-breath?

**Speaker A:** As the skill develops, there'll be a progression. In the beginning, the very beginning, We're not in that really nice state, so we've got to talk ourselves into it. Once we're into that state, now we're going to start noticing the factors and the features of it in the sense of, can I sustain this? Can I keep the thoughts only wholesome? We also have, wow, this feels really nice. And we begin to inspect that we do actually feel okay. We feel satisfied. That's really quite marvelous because we're not— I mean, even when we are satisfied in the world, we're not really paying much attention to it. For instance, if we get a new car or whatever like that, we're really paying attention to the new car instead of how good we feel about it. And we don't even recognize that we feel good, not about the car. We feel good because we've chosen to feel good about the car. That same car could arrive and we could go nitpicking it and feel really bad and think we've gotten ripped off. It's up to us how we feel about it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I kind of have a question, just like he was saying. So while we're doing the investigation of, you know, Sukkha or Piti or, you know, any of the factors of Jhana once we feel to be in it, is it a kind of like verbalized process in the mind, or is it

**Speaker A:** something— Yes, that was what we were discussing. So as we continue on with that, in the beginning we talk ourselves into it. As we begin to experience it, we begin to let us say, noted in the way of talking about it in a blow-by-blow.

**Speaker D:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And as we get good at that, we recognize how much of an effort it is that I can watch it without giving a blow-by-blow commentary about it. But I'm still noticing it very well.

**Speaker B:** The blow-by-blow is just to prepare yourself to be able to do it on a nonverbal level, be able to have that same type of recognition.

**Speaker A:** Precisely so. And so in this regard, what happens is, is that as we're paying more and more and more close attention to how good we feel, we stop talking to ourselves about how good we feel so that we can really experience how good we feel.

**Speaker B:** I see.

**Speaker A:** As we're doing that, that's exactly the movement from the first jhana into the second jhana. When we're no longer talking about how good we feel because we're too busy just feeling good.

**Speaker B:** But it is important to get at the beginning when we're getting used to the first Jhana, verbalizing the factors so that we know what we're seeing when it's there.

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker B:** Okay, cool.

**Speaker A:** Sort of like a verification process. And after the verifications have been done enough, often enough, that we trust it. An example of that would be like going swimming in ice water. And so the neophyte is going to put a toe in and then take the toe out and then put the toe back in and take the toe out and then maybe put half the foot in and take the half out. And eventually they're ready to really just jump in. And the jumping in then is the jumping into those feelings so that you're really completely immersed into how good you feel. This is when the body gets all bubbly and gushy and all of that kind of stuff.

**Speaker B:** So what kind of changes can we expect once we've established first Jhana, what are the ways that we could know that it has become second, if that happens?

**Speaker A:** Ah, when even thinking about how good we feel is too much work and takes it away from the fact that we're really feeling good. So by focusing on the feelings themselves, in fact, we're paying now attention to a mind moment of feelings rather than feel, think, feel, think, feel, think, feel, think. We're just feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, feel. And that's the distinction then between the first and the second jhanas, when we really go into, oh wow, I'm feeling good. How there's— and we can't even talk about it, it feels so good. I see that it feels so good.

**Speaker E:** So, so I had a question related to this, uh, because I was noticing in my meditation yesterday this sort gap in thinking, like with those factors of Piti and Sukkha there? And is it just to keep going with that and just like try and maintain that?

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's the repetition over and over again, rather than— it is more like an escalator than it is a staircase. All we have to do is just get on the escalator and the escalator itself takes us up to where most of us are practicing in Western style. This season is not only a staircase, but every step is like 6 or 8 or 10 feet, and it's a great big jump to get up to the next step. So when you recognize, no, it really is more like just an escalator, all you have to do is really just get aboard and enjoy the ride, that the mind will go into those deeper states as we're paying attention to the various factors. And so in the beginning, in first Jhana, we're going to pay most attention to the applied and sustained thought to make sure that the thoughts are wholesome and wholesome and wholesome and wholesome and wholesome over and over again. And then we begin to put gaps in the thoughts. Now, in practice, a way of doing that is getting First, when we sit down, we can think about anything. If we then start corralling the mind so that it's only going to have wholesome thoughts, then we can corral it even further to have it only a particular kind of wholesome thought. If we get it down even further than that, we can get it down to, let us say, a poem or a sutra or a song. And then even more than that, down to a tiny little bit would be like a mantra. Okay. And so I'll use the example of Budo. You heard that one, that's in northeast Thailand. They use Budo. So Bu on the out-breath, in-breath, and then Do on the out-breath. And as we breathe out in that Do and the out-breath stops, we stop thinking and we stop saying the Budo. We don't say the next "boo" until it's time to take the next breath. So how long can we keep the mind quiet has to do with how long we can maintain and sustain the thought of how good I feel holding my breath, and what a nice and how wonderful it's going to be. But we don't do this with words. We do this with thoughtless, just the anticipation of the next breath. And then when it comes in, that's when we come back with the next 'bu' with the in-breath. And so we're just down to just one or two words, and that as we breathe out, we put a gap between those words. And that's how we enter into the second Jhana. And almost every— everyone who's ever experienced that, I always come back saying that as soon as we get the mind quiet like that and we know that it's quiet, the first thing that happens is yeehaw, which takes us right out of the second job, right?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, so that's exactly what happened, is I was like, oh, this is just

**Speaker A:** what Dhammarato— yeah, I did get the mind to be quiet.

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so the deep of the skill is to be able to get into it, recognize you're in it, and maintain it for a little while longer. And then take the breath. And eventually we get to the point, can you take the next breath without starting the mind back up again? And so this is a training for the second Jhana, but in all cases we're really intently focused on the Piti and the Sukkha, not upon the applied and sustained thoughts. And so the second Jhana is going to be, wow, how wonderful and how marvelous this feels, which means that we're primarily focused with the Piti But then in the third Jhana, we let the Piti melt away into just complete relaxation of the Sukkha. This is just so pleasant, and there's no words to it. It's just— and then we take an in-breath. Okay, and so this is how we practice that. Now in the fourth Jhana even that Sukkha melts into equanimity, or the balance of just nothing there, except the wheels of the mind itself are turning in the sense of Paticcasamuppada, in the sense of consciousness and perception and internal organization of thought that breaks out into feelings. And we start watching how all of that stuff works, but we can do that even in the first Jhana, that we don't have to keep only in the first Jhana, having thought or paying attention to the applied and sustained thought, we can also begin to work with the feelings themselves directly. We can begin to see how the mind forms thoughts. But we do that by getting the mind quiet enough without it actually how to say, it's really hard to pull a clock apart, to clean all the gears and get everything, uh, the needle bearings, get them lubricated, get every gear polished and all of that, and then put the clock back together. It's really hard to do that while the clock is still ticking. We have to bring the clock to a stop. And the way that we do that is first off by having only wholesome thoughts, only wholesome thoughts. Then we begin to put the gaps in the thoughts and start paying close attention to how good we feel. And then we let that mellow out into just relaxed how good we feel. But it's not got that wow sensation of the Piti. It just melts into Sukkha, and then that melts into equanimity. And now the mind is really, really super sharp. Sharp and focused.

**Speaker E:** And then what do you do at that point?

**Speaker A:** Enjoy.

**Speaker E:** Just enjoy. Okay, the same. I'm just curious, you know.

**Speaker B:** But yeah, can you talk more about, um, how we know Piti from Sukkha?

**Speaker A:** Okay, Piti and Sukkha are a continuum. That let us say that we actually develop a base of Sukkha first, and as we get the Sukkha going, then we can bring it up and start to control it, to make it big and small and whatnot like that. That's why that happens in the second Jhana, is that jumping for joy with, wow, this is so great, and then we pull ourselves back out of it because it It has that quality of how marvelous it is.

**Speaker B:** So the Piti is more like a little bit of an excited joy, whereas Sukkha is just deep satisfaction, kind of soaking into everything.

**Speaker A:** All right, so I've got two examples that I normally use. One is the example of the title game, the title match, the big football game, maybe the World Series of football, I don't know what they call it, the Rose Bowl or whatever like this, okay? And the star of the show has just made a touchdown. The score is close and he's just made a touchdown that changes the score. What does he do within the first few seconds after he makes the touchdown?

**Speaker B:** Celebration dance.

**Speaker A:** Celebrate and dance. That's the Piti. What happens 15 or 20 seconds after he makes the touchdown?

**Speaker B:** He calms back down and gets back to work.

**Speaker A:** I feel satisfied.

**Speaker B:** Oh, or that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. So you can see that is that the running down the field and getting the motion going is the first Jhana, making the touchdown and then dancing around is the second Jhana, and then the full relaxation of, wow, we've done it. That is the Third Jhāna. So that's a way of looking at it. So here's another example, and that is that at Times Square, once a year you have the New Year's celebration, and they have the big ball and it comes down: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, down to zero. And what happens at that moment in time? What does the crowd do? Yeah, they go jumping for joy, they blow their horns, they shout, finally we've gotten rid of 2021, now we can really celebrate and have a really brand new terrible year, 2022. But anyway, what happens immediately after they, uh, celebrate is that they all break out into the song of Arahant, everybody is hugging, and they rock back back and forth in satisfaction. Oh, should old acquaintance be forgotten? So if you can understand that first initial, yeehaw, followed by wow, that's the kind of feeling that we want. So in that regard, when we are in the first Jhana, we will actually visit momentarily the second and the third Jhanas.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I wondered about that because I mean, it felt like in— well, one meditation mainly that I did, I wondered if it went to something beyond just the first, but I didn't really know how to tell the difference at that point because it was kind of new, you know, to take it to that level. And I wasn't sure where I was. All I knew is it felt pretty damn good. But it was like— moments of like feeling extra good, and then it'd be like, okay, back a little bit more, and then, oh, and then, you know, back down. So,

**Speaker A:** all right, so we can say then that the first Jhana is the base point or the foundation, and that we need to practice being able to get into that state often and be— and to sustain it often and use that as a platform basically for jumping and reaching into the second jhana and coming back down. The question is, can you come into the second jhana and maintain it for a short time and then come back to first jhana without falling all the way out? Yeah, like the hindrances. Yeah. And so that's why we want to make sure that we've gotten that first jhana very, very strongly established. That's the real skill. Is being able to get into first jhana and maintain that, because that's the platform from which we're going to be able to go into the other jhanas successfully. Go ahead, Joe.

**Speaker E:** So you mentioned that it had the factors of the second and the third. Does it also have the factor of equanimity from the fourth and like the subtleness of breath? Because sometimes I notice in my meditation that my breath it almost becomes so subtle that it's hard to even know if it's there. And yeah, I'm just wondering if that factor of equanimity, or there's this sense of like, yeah, I mean, yeah, is the equanimity present also in the first to some degree?

**Speaker A:** Right. We could say that we use the breath then as the vehicle to get us from the first or into the first, and then from the first into second and the third. But once we've gotten into the third jhana, now the breath is no longer as valuable as it is because now our objects primarily are not the body, not the feelings, but actually how the mind itself is working.

**Speaker E:** Right. Okay. And then like, I mean, what is

**Speaker A:** not to be strived for is to be ready for when it happens.

**Speaker E:** Right. And so sometimes that's a natural outcome of practice.

**Speaker A:** It's not a goal. If it's a goal, it'll be very hard to get.

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** You have to back into this thing.

**Speaker E:** Yeah. And so sometimes I'm meditating and I lose— and it's also that I lose track of my body a little bit. And I like I will stop meditating and I'll open my eyes and I'm like, holy crap, my foot is really painful right now. And I didn't really notice.

**Speaker A:** You didn't even notice it before.

**Speaker E:** Yeah. And I'm just wondering, is that like, I don't know. It's just what's happening for me right now.

**Speaker A:** There is a technique that is actually a Mudra and that we haven't even talked about the Mudras of how good the body can feel. That we can practice that by touching the hands and feeling the body and feeling the touch and the sensations. And also, this is the meditation poses to where we take the thumbs and put them together, or this where the index and the thumb are not quite touching, or maybe they touch occasionally, but there's a gap between there. Can you feel the gap? Can you— can the thumb feel the index and the index feel the thumb? And which is which? Can you do that before they actually touch? And also, can you relax the hand? Can the hand become very, very relaxed? Because normally people are doing this with a lot of tension. So we have to consciously make the hand relax. OK, so there's another one, a Mudra that's called Touch the Earth. And what that basically means, imagine that you're sitting there in a cross-legged posture with your right hand resting on the right knee with the fingers touching, pointing down with that long finger almost ready to touch the earth or touch the floor. So that when you're in the Port Jhana, instead of having to wake up or open your eyes to check out to see, are you really on the floor? You can actually just touch the floor with that finger to reassure yourself that you haven't actually flown out of the room. Okay, because the body is just not there much anymore, that it's becoming kind of a shimmering blob, so to speak. And it can give the feeling of, uh, that you're like 60 feet in the air, that when you look down on things, you look down as if you're on a tall skyscraper to where even the cars look like a tiny little thing way down there someplace. And so it's good to be able to remind ourselves in that kind of state to, hey, I'm not flying, that I'm actually sitting here on the ground. And all I need to do is to put that finger down to the floor to touch, to remind myself that I am actually still here without losing that state. So that's part of the training. Once we get into the establishment of the fourth jhana, we recognize, yeah, it's nice, but I mean, I've got what I need out of it because everything that you really need is available in the first Jhana anyway. These things are like, uh, imagine that you're going into a buffet because they've got one particular food that you really like and you stock up on it. But while you're there, you recognize, hey, wait a minute, this room is just full of all kinds of strange food. That would be the way that we would approach the higher Jhanas, is just extra food on the plate.

**Speaker E:** Sometimes I find though with the first Jhana that the like waves of pleasure or the Piti can be a little bit overwhelming. And yeah, and a little bit like seductive, kind of like, wow, I just want to like only do this, you know. And yeah, I don't know if you

**Speaker A:** wanted to come on. So people become attached to it in the sense of— Yeah, a little bit. I can do this only when I'm sitting on the floor.

**Speaker E:** No, I mean, I have it in regular everyday life too, you know, like I'm feeling it a little bit right now, you know, just from talking about it and sort of inclining my mind in that direction, you know. So I feel the sort of familiar waves there, you know, so.

**Speaker A:** Right, so that's the way that everything has to do back with that feeling of familiarity. That's what we're looking for. How familiar do you feel? How much at home, how much at rest, how much secure do you feel? And so that whole quality of repeating it over and over and over again, as it becomes more and more familiar, you learn the territory, you're investigating, you're paying close attention to what's going on. You become friends, become family with your own mind rather than at war, because we're not able to keep up with the rules that we make for ourselves. And having internal conflict— I want this and I want that, and they need that, and they— oh, I need this one too— and all of that kind of stuff. We become a crowd that way. But when we get ourselves into a state of satisfaction that diversity melts away into unity in the sense of everything is okay, everything's fine. It's not a distinction between this problem is big but that one's bigger. It's just that these are not problems at all. They're just nothing to it. So that's the kind of state Go ahead.

**Speaker D:** I was going to say, can the conflicts and stuff still arise, but now it's like recontextualized, not so much as conflicts, because you have like the mindfulness of all of the sides and you're like respecting them all equally and stuff. You're letting them all like say their part. Or is it more just like that whole inner turmoil, like wanting different things just like sort of resolves, like, and you just like only like want one thing at a time.

**Speaker A:** Well, we were kind of taught how to do it like that by society, by our teachers, by our cousins, by our friends, by our family, by our older siblings, by the bullies at school. We learn this kind of behavior and then we feel like that we're stuck in it. And worse than that, we feel like that's who I am. Without recognizing that, no, the real teaching of the Buddha about anatta is to recognize that you're actually a moving target. You're not the same, that you do have choices, and that right now we're exercising the choice of, I'm going to intentionally feel good rather than half-intentionally feeling bad the way that I've been doing it all this time. So that's the way of looking at it, is that I'm just going to take the opportunity to just drop society and everything that society demands of me and just be who I really am, which is really okay. I'm fine.

**Speaker D:** So I guess it doesn't really like—

**Speaker E:** yeah, yeah, I was going to say, I think like I tend to see that, like you tend to see that the problems really aren't problems.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. But there aren't really any problems. That's kind of— yeah, they're never worrying. There never were any, and they're never— they're never going to be any problems.

**Speaker A:** There never are going to be any problems. There's always going to be just wants, desires, grasping and clinging, and feeling bad when we don't get what we want. And when we stop wanting things, we're great. And so not wanting anything from meditation is the goal. Learning to train yourself into being satisfied with not getting the jhanas is the only way that you're going to get into them.

**Speaker D:** That's a good point. That's a good point.

**Speaker A:** Dag, I'm glad to see you. Hi. Welcome.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Hi guys, we've already been going for a couple hours now. I think that we're kind of getting tired, but I'm glad that you joined. That's all right, that's all right. I was contemplating whether I should just join or not.

**Speaker C:** I

**Speaker A:** woke up having a particularly unpleasant morning today, so So something drew me here.

**Speaker E:** Me too. So, and now I'm really happy after talking for 2 hours. So it can change.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** I was ready to go to bed and now I'm up. I guess I'll be ready tomorrow night to go to bed at

**Speaker A:** least. Well, never mind. This will be over and you'll be tired and then you'll go to sleep. Everything's okay.

**Speaker D:** Never mind sleep again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, never mind, go sleep. Well guys, do we have any last points, any final questions or anything?

**Speaker B:** Oh, when are the— when are our, uh, Srotapanna diplomas coming in?

**Speaker A:** I've got a piece of paper and a pencil, and you can do your own.

**Speaker B:** Oh, really? We've even been given that?

**Speaker A:** Actually, I don't have any paper and pencils. Go get your own. Or better still, you don't need a piece of paper if you have them. A style instead. What was that, Robert?

**Speaker D:** I said if you have the real thing, like, why do you need the paper?

**Speaker A:** Exactly. I just, I just saw this recently. This one's done by Bhikkhu, uh, um, uh, Arahant Brahm. And it is actually a certificate in happiness. Wow. But it's a joke. But he knows it's a joke, and he's intending it to be a joke. It is just, here, you know, you are certifiably happy, and then he signs it. Congratulations, a diploma. But, but our society is so diploma-oriented. Very diploma-oriented, very result-oriented rather than process-oriented. Guess what? The diploma is not worth anything if you didn't go through the process of getting it. And if you went through the process of getting the diploma and you got the benefit and the results that the diploma is only supposed to to acknowledge that you've gotten the skills. That's what it's originally for, but we misuse it. We think that the diploma is now the substitute for the actual skills, or the proof of the skills. No, the proof of the skills is exercising the skills. That's the proof of the skills, not the diploma.

**Speaker E:** The problem is when you skip class and don't actually do the work and they still give you a diploma anyways.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, that was my case.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, that's how it was for me. I realized in college, oh, you don't have to go to class. There's nobody telling you you have to go to class. And so that stopped pretty quickly for me.

**Speaker A:** You don't even have to make good grades. All you have to do is make good friends with the teacher. That's your only job. Well, guys, this has been really great. I really enjoyed it today. Thank you so much. I especially am appreciative of Dave coming on. Thank you so much, Dave, for showing up. I hope to see you again soon.

**Speaker C:** No, thank you guys so much for your time. I really appreciate it.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, it's really nice meeting you. I hope to see you again.

**Speaker A:** What can we do for you? Why don't you give me a call maybe tomorrow or something and we can talk? Uh, yeah, um, I'll see about it. Uh, we can, we can see. Uh, I'm not sure what, what my schedule is tomorrow, but, uh, yeah, or whenever you like. I'm available for you. Yeah, all right, thanks. Okay guys, thank you so much.

**Speaker D:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. See you. See everybody. A lot of good friends today.

**Speaker C:** See you guys, take care, bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** Bye. Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato with Sangha friends, is a comprehensive and accessible introduction to the practice of Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing) framed as a skill to cultivate happiness and ease in life. Here is a summary of the key themes and teachings:

### **Core Philosophy: Practice as a Skill for Happiness**
*   **The Goal:** The ultimate aim is not striving for distant attainments, but learning "the art of being happy" here and now. It's about "chilling out" (Nibbana as cooling off) and talking ourselves into feeling good instead of the lifelong habit of talking ourselves into feeling bad.
*   **It's a Skill:** Like any art (music, martial arts), it requires consistent, gentle **practice**, not hard striving. The emphasis is on "easy persistence" and taking "the easy way out" of mental suffering.

### **Key Analogies for the Practice**
1.  **Cleaning the Basement / Draining the Swamp:** The mind is like a cluttered basement or a swamp full of alligators (old pains, regrets, hindrances). The practice involves cleaning it out, which can be unpleasant initially, but leads to a valuable, usable space (a peaceful mind).
2.  **Murphy's Law & Mindfulness (Sati):** Things go wrong at the worst times. **Sati** (mindfulness) is the skill of "remembering to be in the present moment," so we can handle difficulties skillfully when they arise, like a martial artist remembering their moves.
3.  **Mental Jiu-Jitsu:** The practice is akin to the "soft" martial art of jiu-jitsu—learning not to resist or fight mental attacks (negative thoughts, emotions) directly, but to skillfully step aside and let them pass, maintaining inner ease.

### **The Foundational Skills (The "Four Skills")**
The practice develops four interwoven skills:
1.  **Right Sati (Mindfulness):** Remembering to be present, starting with remembering to watch and gently slow the breath.
2.  **Right View (Investigation):** Looking at the mind to discern wholesome from unwholesome thoughts. Asking, "Is this thought worth having?"
3.  **Right Effort:** The effort to "change the mind"—to discard unwholesome thoughts (like taking garbage out of the basement) and replace them with wholesome, satisfying ones.
4.  **Right Attitude:** Cultivating a nurturing, friendly attitude towards oneself, not a critical one. Treating your own mind like a cherished infant, not an enemy.

### **Important Practical Instructions & Warnings**
*   **Start Easy:** Begin by simply taking long, easy breaths and relaxing. The breath is always available.
*   **"Never mind, start again":** This is the core instruction. When you lose mindfulness, gently forgive yourself and begin again without self-criticism.
*   **Avoid Striving & Over-effort:** Western meditation often mistakenly emphasizes hard striving and long, painful sits. True practice is about **satisfaction**, not attainment. If practice feels like a struggle, you're trying too hard. The Buddha's path is the "downhill," easy path.
*   **Gladden the Mind:** Actively cultivate wholesome, joyful thoughts. This is contrasted with some methods (like the Mahasi noting method) that can lead to just staring at suffering. The goal is to **replace** dissatisfaction with satisfaction.
*   **Practice in Life:** Integrate the practice into daily life. Use the breath and mindful checking-in to handle irritations (like a car not starting) without creating internal drama.

### **On Jhanas (Meditative Absorptions) and Nibbana**
*   **Jhanas as Natural Outcomes:** The Jhanas (states of deep, pleasurable concentration) are not goals to strive for, but natural byproducts of a well-developed, satisfied, and unified mind. They are described as an escalator, not a steep staircase.
*   **First Jhana:** Established by maintaining wholesome thoughts and a base of satisfaction.
*   **Higher Jhanas:** Develop as thinking subsides into pure feeling (Piti - joy, Sukkha - happiness), then deep tranquility, and finally equanimity.
*   **Nibbana is "Cooling":** It is not a distant, hard goal (Nirvana), but the everyday experience of "chilling out," letting go of mental heat (anger, craving), and taking the easy way out.

### **Addressing Common Challenges**
*   **Dealing with Negative Emotions:** Welcome them as "old friends," investigate them with curiosity, and use the skills to let them go. Don't deny or fight them.
*   **Self-Critical Standards:** Many suffer from setting impossible rules for themselves. The practice involves replacing this critical inner voice with a nurturing one.
*   **Feeling Overwhelmed:** This often comes from wanting a different experience. The solution is to drop the wanting and be satisfied with the present moment, however it is.
*   **Insights Like "No-Self":** These are not intellectual concepts to grasp. They emerge naturally from the practice of reducing selfishness and seeing the fluid, choice-driven nature of the mind. Happiness and satisfaction are more immediate and important goals.

### **Conclusion**
The talk is an invitation to a gentle, forgiving, and joyful practice rooted in the Buddha's original teachings. It frames the entire path as a practical skill set for cultivating happiness, resilience, and ease by cleaning out mental clutter, remembering to be present, and learning to nurture oneself. The recurring message is to stop striving, be kind to yourself, and simply **practice feeling good**.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this detailed talk, the speaker uses a rich tapestry of **metaphors and stories** to explain meditation practice, its challenges, and its benefits. Here is a breakdown of the primary ones:

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **Cleaning the Basement:** This is the central metaphor for the practice.
    *   **The Basement:** Represents the subconscious mind.
    *   **The Junk/Dead Bodies:** Symbolize repressed memories, regrets, traumas, and unwholesome mental patterns.
    *   **Turning it into a Den/Living Room:** Represents the goal of creating a peaceful, usable, and joyful mind.
    *   **The Point:** The work of meditation (investigation) is necessary but can be unpleasant because you must confront and remove this "junk."

2.  **Draining the Swamp (with Alligators):** A related metaphor emphasizing the difficulty of the initial intention.
    *   **The Swamp:** The messy, problematic state of the untrained mind.
    *   **Draining the Swamp:** The original goal of practice (to find peace and clarity).
    *   **The Alligators:** The immediate, difficult mental hindrances (anger, fear, craving, etc.) that arise when you start to practice.
    *   **The Point:** When you're busy fighting alligators (hindrances), it's easy to forget your original goal was to drain the swamp (find lasting peace). This explains why people get discouraged.

3.  **Murphy's Law (Applied to Mindfulness):**
    *   **The Law:** "Anything that can go wrong will go wrong at the worst possible time."
    *   **The Application:** We need mindfulness (*sati*) most precisely when things are about to go wrong—when we are stressed, triggered, or challenged. The practice is about developing the skill so it's available "at launch time," not just in calm moments.

4.  **Martial Arts / Jiu-Jitsu:**
    *   **Karate Grandmaster:** Represents someone with skills (meditative skills) who must *remember* to use them when attacked (by mental hindrances or life's problems).
    *   **Jiu-Jitsu (The "Soft Art"):** Specifically used to illustrate the core approach. It's not about hard resistance but about using an opponent's (or a problem's) energy against itself, stepping aside, and "taking the easy way out." Meditation is presented as **"mental jiu-jitsu."**

5.  **Nibbana/Nirvana as "Cooling Off":**
    *   **The Metaphor:** Extinguishing a fire, letting food cool down, or simply chilling out.
    *   **Hot Food/Pizza:** Represents provocative words, insults, or stressful situations. If you "swallow" them while hot, you get burned (react with anger/suffering). The skill is to let them "cool off" before internalizing them.
    *   **Domesticated Animals:** A cool, non-reactive mind is like a domesticated dog that doesn't bark at every stranger.
    *   **The Point:** Nibbana is not a distant, hard-to-attain heavenly state, but the everyday skill of cooling the mind's reactions.

6.  **The Path in the Wilderness:**
    *   **The Wilderness:** A state of being lost in confusion and suffering.
    *   **The Train Whistle/Tracks:** The first hint or discovery of the Dhamma (the path).
    *   **The Footpath:** The practice itself.
    *   **Uphill vs. Downhill Path:** Most people assume the spiritual path is an arduous uphill climb (striving, effort). The speaker argues the Buddha's path is actually the **downhill path**—the path of easing, relaxing, and "taking the easy way out."

7.  **Art and Skill Development:**
    *   Meditation is compared to **music, dance, painting, or archery.** It's an art, which means it's a *skill* that requires **practice, not just theory.** You practice feeling good just as an artist practices their craft.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Zen Student and the Master:** A short story where a student asks the master if he is meditating to become enlightened. The master replies, **"No, I'm just sitting here because I am enlightened."** This illustrates that the goal is to embody the state now, not strive for a future attainment.

2.  **The Man Missing His Girlfriend:** A detailed anecdote about a man who feels sad after his girlfriend leaves. The story dissects how he *chooses* to interpret the memory. He can pine and suffer ("I miss her, I need her"), or he can think fondly and joyfully ("I really enjoyed our time together"). This demonstrates that **we create our own emotional reality through our thoughts.**

3.  **The Toddler and the Bookcase:** A story about a toddler who pulls a bookcase over on himself while trying to use it to stand up. This illustrates how we often become "overwhelmed" by our emotions because we've "clung" to or "wanted" something in a way that creates the conditions for our own downfall.

4.  **The Football/New Year's Eve Analogy (for Jhana):** Used to explain the difference between *piti* (joyful excitement) and *sukkha* (deep happiness/satisfaction).
    *   **First Jhana:** Running the play (directed effort).
    *   **Second Jhana (Piti):** The immediate celebration dance after a touchdown, or the crowd's roar at midnight—**exuberant joy.**
    *   **Third Jhana (Sukkha):** The satisfied calm in the locker room after the game, or the communal singing of "Auld Lang Syne"—**deep, peaceful satisfaction.**

5.  **Personal Anecdotes:**
    *   The speaker references his own time in the **Goenka tradition** as an example of "striving" and uphill effort.
    *   He mentions his **Thai stepdaughter** sitting naturally in the lotus posture to challenge the Western obsession with difficult postures, arguing comfort is key.
    *   He talks about learning from **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa** that the true practice is about "chilling out."

### **Recurring Themes in the Imagery**
*   **Ease vs. Striving:** Downhill path, jiu-jitsu, chilling, cooling off, escalator vs. staircase.
*   **Remembering vs. Forgetting:** Mindfulness as remembering to breathe, the karate master forgetting his moves.
*   **Transformation of Space:** Basement to den, swamp to dry land.
*   **Dealing with Attacks:** Martial arts, slings and arrows missing their target, dodging, stepping aside.
*   **Natural Processes:** Breathing, cooling, digesting.

These metaphors and stories collectively paint a picture of meditation (**Anapanasati**) not as a grim, ascetic struggle, but as a practical, skillful, and often gentle art of **mental housecleaning, self-nurturing, and learning to take the easy, joyful path in life.**
