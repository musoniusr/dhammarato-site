### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Mudita.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, are not Metta.

**Speaker A:** No.

**Speaker B:** And so there's no reason to use the word. In fact, you use the word love, and I don't use that word. Why? Because it's loaded down with all kinds of stuff. Well, sure, kindness, friendship, gratitude. One of the things I tell Cam is, thank you so much for taking care of me. You do a really great job. You fix my food and you serve me, and I think that you're just the best wife that anyone could have. But I don't have to say I love her.

**Speaker A:** So saying I love her is not.

**Speaker B:** A good thing, or— Well, I'm saying that I don't use it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker B:** Because I understand that the word love— here's an example of what I'm talking about. Two women are at a party, and one of them glances over to the woman on the other side of the aisle, or on the other side of the room, and says to her friend there, don't you just love her dress? Which back has more envy or maybe just catty sarcasm. So that's how love is often used. Also, another way of looking at it is when you adore somebody— adorable— rather than just being merely attractive or having a painted face. Painted by Max Factor or Maybelline. So, uh, the whole point then about love and Metta is, is that there's many different ways of using the word. The same is true of meditation. So I tend to not use the word meditation and use the word correct practice.

**Speaker A:** I think one translation of Metta which doesn't use the word is well-wishing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, why should you wish anybody well? Why should you want something for them? Aren't they good enough the way that they are?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, maybe, hopefully.

**Speaker B:** So instead of saying, I wish you would get over your bad feelings You could say something like, uh, it would be good to be free from all of those feelings. Wishing and hoping and all of that is wanting.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that is a part of that test for sure.

**Speaker B:** And the things are okay the way that they are now, which means that in fact, um, In this regard, if you're going to give someone an apology, be very careful of the words that you're using.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** One of the words that I tend to not use is the word sorry, because I'm not sorry. I made a joke and he took it wrong. I'm not sorry that I made the joke. It was a foolish statement because he could take it wrong. So I'm willing to say it was a foolish statement, but I'm not sorry for it. All right. And so this is the point, is that the Buddhist teaching of the Buddha— let's be careful with our language, because our language, when we listen to it, can point back to the state of mind that we're in and point to the kind of language that we use inside the mind. So watching and being very careful with the language that we use, verbal or written, helps to keep the mind pure. Everything is all right, everything is fine. He took my remarks silly, or he took offense to the remark. And so let's set things straight. No offense mean— I guess you'd have to be sorry if you actually meant to offend someone, but if you meant to offend someone, the likelihood of offering apology has to have some pressure behind it rather than wisdom. In other words, Mommy says, go tell Aunt Susie you're sorry. So love is like that. Metta is also. And then in fact, in the Western world, Metta has become abused and misused, mainly coming from that place that is taught commonly in meditation retreats. When they teach Metta, they say Have loving-kindness thoughts like, 'May all beings be happy. May all beings be liberated.' Now, that 'may all beings be liberated,' that's very much like the Bodhisattva vow. 'May all of those people be liberated, and then I can become liberated,' rather than saying, 'I can be liberated far enough, and I can help people if they want help, but I don't have to want them to be happy and liberated. That's not my business.' If they don't want to be happy and they don't want to be liberated, that's okay with me. So may all beings be happy is a state of Dukkha, wanting something that you don't have and you'll never get it. And that's the way that Metta normally works. The Dalai Lama said— I'll say this and then you can finish— the Dalai Lama said, my religion is kindness. And so being kind to people, that would be Metta enough. But wanting them to change so that you can feel better is how most people use the word Metta. In other words, here's your pill that I've just manufactured, take it and feel better, or else.

**Speaker A:** But if you saw Metta as a feeling instead of the thoughts they're using, because as I see it, it's come from Visuddhimagga, the formula. Actually, if you only have loving feelings without the thinking That would be Metta then.

**Speaker B:** Loving feelings like, wow, do you want in her pants?

**Speaker A:** No, no, a little bit more.

**Speaker B:** That's how the word love is used.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but isn't there a thing called unconditional love?

**Speaker B:** The Christians would like to think so. But their love is almost always conditioned. You got to be the right color.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Because it's a matter of language. And that's what I'm talking about, is let's start looking at the language that we're using so that we can find some language that actually has some wholesome benefit, especially to us, because you can't help other people.

**Speaker A:** No, but my experience is that actually using the standard phrases actually make me quite happy. So even though I know it's probably not doing anything for them or not changing anyone, and I'm okay with not changing anyone, it's just happy thoughts for me.

**Speaker B:** Yes, in that case, those are happy wholesome thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I've done some Metta retreats and I've been incredibly happy in them.

**Speaker B:** So, um, in the sense that you're talking about, you're saying it in the sense of, uh, he's okay, he's all right. And another way of saying it is everything is okay, everything is all right. He's not my trouble, he's not my problem. Let him do what he wants to do. Yeah, and it has no quality of wanting to fix or change him, but rather that he's already okay.

**Speaker A:** So love is not wanting to change them, letting them be as they are?

**Speaker B:** Letting them be as they are. Well, yeah, if you want to use the word love, but you don't have to. No, you don't have to use the word because the word is already so packed with stuff that you want. Okay, so, uh, I would love to have you come over for dinner. It's just I want you to come over to dinner.

**Speaker A:** Yep.

**Speaker B:** So loving almost always is quality of, uh, Dukkha. It has the quality of wanting something. Like, don't you just love her dress? Has the quality of Anicca. Are more than likely sarcasm. Don't you just love her dress? Means you don't, you don't approve.

**Speaker A:** So love is acceptance then?

**Speaker B:** Well, you're trying to define it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I am.

**Speaker B:** Okay, and that's a good point. I generally want to define the words that I use, and if you define it, you can use it, but recognize that that word is probably going to be redefined by the people who are listening to it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so yeah, never mind. But, but I saw Buddha Dasa— there's a PDF about the Brahmaviharas or Metta. I haven't read it. I have it on the reading list. What was his teaching on Brahmaviharas?

**Speaker B:** I don't remember anything about him teaching about it. If you've got a PDF, send it to me one way or the other, and it will be put on our PDF media library so that people can find it.

**Speaker A:** I think it's— yeah, I will send it to you, but I think it's still— it is on— if he said.

**Speaker B:** It, I agree with it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay, I will send it to you and I will read it and see what his teaching is. I think it's quite clear that he.

**Speaker B:** Probably spent quite a lot of time defining it. But as I said before, Metta is not a teaching of the Buddha. Metta was a teaching that predated the Buddha.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And along with the Brahma Viharas. In fact, I don't know where the Brahma Viharas came from, but I do know that Metta predated the Buddha. And that the Buddha did not have, let us say, enduring congratulatory thoughts, but rather that it has limits to it.

**Speaker A:** But he mentions it quite a few times, quite often actually.

**Speaker B:** Who?

**Speaker A:** Brahmaviharas in the suttas.

**Speaker B:** Who?

**Speaker A:** Buddha.

**Speaker B:** What suttas?

**Speaker A:** Well, you have Metta, but that's a weird sutta. I don't understand it that much. It's— I actually, I don't think it's Buddha's words. But there was the second Loving Kindness Sutra. I don't remember what number it is, but it's where it takes you through all the jhanas.

**Speaker B:** Well, wholesome thoughts. So if Metta is a wholesome thought, yeah, okay. In fact, one of the points to make here is that students have told me that my good friend Dhammavitu, who teaches over at Deepakawan, When he's, let us say, corralled or cornered into teaching Metta, he spends his time on teaching that it starts at home, just like charity begins at home. That's some obscure passage in the Bible somewhere, probably in Paul's writings. But Ajahn Dhammavitu speaks that giving yourself that is the same thing as treating our unwholesome thoughts as, 'Aha, I see you,' rather than, 'Oh no, I've got unwholesome thoughts,' or 'How do I get rid of unwholesome thoughts?' is actually an unwholesome thought. So we can do all of the right stuff without using the word Metta. And if we do use the word Metta, we're in danger of having it wrongly defined. And so having it correctly defined would be correct practice, and we don't have to do that. We can have— everything is okay, everything is all right. But I hold the method for everyone, that's a bit grandiose. So the Dalai Lama didn't say, may all beings be happy. He just says, my religion is kindness. Let's just be kind. But where does kindness start? It starts with being kind to yourself. Another word that I would use would be nurturing, as opposed to critical. If we can have nurturing thoughts to nurture ourselves— wow, I'm really glad that I saw I'm using the word Metta. Let me change that into kindness. Let me change that word into nurturing.

**Speaker A:** Yep.

**Speaker B:** And so you can nurture your wife. You can nurture her in the sense of, thank you, thank you for taking care of me, thank you for doing your household duties, I really appreciate how good you take care of things. That's being kind to her. But if you say, 'I love you,' that's dangerous.

**Speaker A:** Well, when you're married, it's— I suppose you're already in the danger.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that's why it's even, let us say, more valuable. Then to start watching the language that we use. She would actually probably appreciate your appreciation of what she is and what she does. And the word 'I love you' is kind of a throwaway word, like 'please forgive me for all of the bad things that I've just said to you because I love you.' It's not going to happen. And so yes, it has a lot to do with how we define the words. And in defining them, like on our talks here, we can define the word that people are using. But you don't have to do words that need defining when you're talking to your wife. You can avoid the words that need definitions and use words that don't need definitions, like the words gratitude. Wow, I'm really grateful for you to do all the stuff that you're doing. You're really doing a great job of taking care of me. You're the best mommy I ever had. Which is actually, uh, in, in that regard, you going in the direction of nurturing. Thank you to nurturing care for me. So gratitude is what you want to express. Love generally has the quality of I want something. It has, let us call it, the quality of buttering up. That men often butter up their wife so that he can get something that he wants, like for her to shut up and stop nagging. So again, the whole point that we're on to is being careful of the kind of words that we're using. Yeah, because that points right back to what kind of mind state that we're in and can see our own, our own unwholesome thoughts, because we can see You see clearly the words we use when the thoughts and mental state that we're in is often more difficult to see. So I think that you're beginning to figure out how you can talk to your wife so that it will be the most valuable. Well, I'm out of the hot water.

**Speaker A:** She's put you— I need some practice.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it takes practice. That's the other point, is we have to practice generosity, practice gratitude. Practice feeling so wealthy that we've got stuff to give away. Most people who have a lot of money— we can use the word wealthy, but they're really, really stingy. In fact, some people don't even get wealthy unless they are stingy. I'm stingy. I'm really— I mean, I'm a tightwad like you wouldn't believe. But most really wealthy people are not generous at all. So I'm a tightwad, but I'm generous. The very, very rich, the billionaires, they spend money looking for happiness. They bought all of the stuff, they bought all the goodies, maybe they've got a yacht and a Maserati and all the girlfriends that they could buy, trophy wives and trophy girlfriends, etc., like that, and they're still not happy. So they want to buy something. One guy in the United States has actually bought a Supreme Court judge.

**Speaker A:** Who was that?

**Speaker B:** Arlen Crowe.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, and he has purchased Clarence Thomas. Others are spending their money to make rockets. Others are planning on having a place on Mars. Listen, going to Mars and setting up a colony on Mars is not going to make him happy.

**Speaker A:** No.

**Speaker B:** In fact, that's one thing that we can say about Bill Gates. Bill Gates is actually old enough now to follow in the tradition of the robber barons that happened in the first of the century. Like Carnegie and Vanderbilt, those guys, Ford, Henry Ford, they put their money back in philanthropy. They got all of that money. They worked really hard. They weren't happy making money, but they became happy by giving it away. Look what good stuff that Bill Gates has done with his money. He's cured HIV in Africa and other things like that, giving out medicines. He's done a lot of stuff. I know that some people are criticizing him. That's because they would criticize any good deed. But people get joy out of helping others by practicing generosity. So practice generosity with your wife. An example of practicing generosity with her is by giving her all of the power of the relationship. The story is about Mullah Nasruddin. I read this book while I was in India 50 years ago, and there are a number of good stories in there. One of them that I'm thinking about is that the townsman came to the Mullah and says, what do you do? And he says, I only do important things. And he says, well, what do you mean? He says, my wife does all the unimportant stuff, like what house we have, how the kids are dressed, what car we have, what school the kids go to, what church we go to. What wardrobe that I wear, what wardrobe she will. In other words, anything that has to do with spending money, my wife makes those decisions. She takes care of all the unimportant stuff. And then they said, well, Mullah, what is the important stuff? And being a good Muslim, he's making answers like, where is the mercy of God? So in our regard, in our language, what we say is, is that can I be happy right now? Can I be joyful? Let my wife take care of all of the business. I've got nothing to do. Now, the interesting thing is, is that when you give her all of the bill, she really likes that. But then out of her joy and gratitude and also confusion, she's going to come and ask for your advice. And you give her your advice, and then she'll go do what you wanted her to do in the first place. But if you tell her to go do what you want her to do, she's going to balk. So go ahead and tell her she can do anything. She wants to buy a new house, sure, go ahead, go pick it out. You want a new house, you go shopping. You go do it. And so she says, well, what neighborhood? And now you've got a choice because she's asked your advice. But don't give her your advice. Let her come and ask it and give her all of the power to do everything. That's being generous, giving it all away. And so when she comes and asks you stuff, you can say, well, whatever you want to do, do it any way you want to. But mostly the guys will start arguing with their wife. The wife says, I want to do this, and they says, no, you don't. And you come up with some reason, and now you're back in the same position you just got yourself into. And so letting her have her way on everything will make your relationship with her easy. And fighting for her, with her, to get your way is going to make that relationship fragile. So that's the Buddha's advice. Let the wife make all the decisions. She's going to anyway. So could she do it with you on her side, or is she going to do it while you're fighting with her? So how long were you in India?

**Speaker A:** When we're talking about India, I'm just curious.

**Speaker B:** I was there off and on over a course of a number of years for a total of probably about 3 years.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** All during the late 1970s, early '80s, right? I came to Thailand in 1982.

**Speaker A:** '82. Now, when did you become a monk?

**Speaker B:** Uh, 1984.

**Speaker A:** So you stayed as a layperson for 2 years?

**Speaker B:** At Wat Soi Nok, most of the time, yeah, for more than a year.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And how was that? You found your place in the Dharma?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, when I got to Wat Soi Nok, I knew I was home. Yeah, I was at the place where I needed to be, that I had been searching for all of those years.

**Speaker A:** And it was the Anapanasati that clicked, or was it the Vipassana and Ajahn? Was it Ajahn Po?

**Speaker B:** Ajahn Po, right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** My relationship was mainly with Ajahn Po. Yeah, he was the abbot of Wat Suan Mokkh. And he would schedule talks, private talks with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, but I was around Ajahn Po all the time. Not all the time, let us say frequently.

**Speaker A:** And what was it about the Buddhist teaching and the relationship that made you feel at home?

**Speaker B:** One of them was that I knew that he cared for me. That was easy enough to tell that he really cared about me. He did things for me that he didn't have to do. He knew that I would be hungry, so he brought bananas. The first time that I met him, it was getting dark. It was after about 7 PM, and he had been standing at the gates waiting for me. And the first thing he said to me was, where have you been? I have been waiting for you. Actually, I was having trouble with the bicycle, losing spokes. But it was 2 years or more before I found out later, just by accident, that he had seen me because he had been in Chumphon, and on the way back he saw me riding the bicycle. And made the assumption that I was on my way to watch Suwan Mokkh. So he was there to greet me. There was another time that I had gotten off of the bus early in the morning, coming back, I think, from a visa run in the south. And so I had had Anagami had gotten a bus that arrived at Wat Soi Nok about 3:00 in the morning, 3:30 in the morning. And so I came into the gate, nobody is around, and so I set my bags down and sat there. And within minutes, Ajahn Po shows up. Really weird stuff like that. He would stand in the yard of the kuti and wait for me to figure out that he was there. Not coughing or burping or anything, just standing there seeing how long it took me to figure out that he was there.

**Speaker A:** So what's that?

**Speaker B:** He was a real Zen master. He didn't know much English. Yeah, but his Zen stick was his presence. He would just show up, which gave me the direct feeling that he really cared. He really cared about me. I feel really grateful to him. That's in fact the reason that, uh, that I'm doing the calls, is to pay him back. It's not paying it back, it's paying forward. That I give you all this love and attention and all of that because he gave that to me. So that's how the Dharma is spread. It's not a business deal. See, you go to a psychologist, you have to pay her, you pay back, you get the service. You know, it's a business deal. But the Dharma is not a payback, it's to pay forward. You get the gift of the Dharma and you go spread it someplace else. So here's an example. It'd be like fire. You go to the neighbor's house because the middle of the night your fire went out and the house is cold. So you go to the neighbor and you get some coals in a bucket, but you can't pay him back because he's already got a fire. But if somebody comes to your house needing fire, you give them some of the coals out of your fireplace. So that's how it works— paying it forward, giving somebody something that's of enormous value— joy. Happiness, wholesome thoughts. So you hear me talking about it, you go do that with your wife. You go take care of her. You don't have to tell her you love her, but you certainly can say, I really appreciate you. I'm going to watch my mouth. So is that all you wanted to talk about?

**Speaker A:** Yes, well, I have one question. I work night shift, so there's always a sense, a little bit of tiredness, and it kind of The first thing that usually it's hard to do the 6 times a day, but is it even beneficial to practice meditation when you're tired or sleepy?

**Speaker B:** Actually, it's the absolute best time. Okay. Because the thoughts you're having is, oh, I am so tired. Oh, I hurt. And the answer to that is let me just lay here and rest. Oh, rest is so nice, rest is so wonderful.

**Speaker A:** Sometimes I practice at work when I have a few minutes over, and I kind of— I mean, it becomes really quiet, not even a single thought, but it's like, I'm like, I awake or.

**Speaker B:** Sleep, but it's just— Yes, just let it go. Just have wholesome thoughts, and pretty soon you can put gaps in those wholesome thoughts. But the unwholesome thoughts just keep coming one after another after another after another after another.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but when I have this, which I think is tiredness, there's no thoughts at all. It's just calm and rest and nothing to it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And then I think, oh, it's a bad meditation.

**Speaker B:** Well, if you're already satisfied that this is just so nice, nothing— that is quite nice.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so that would be then close to the Jhana, is that everything is okay, everything is fine, and you don't have to keep thinking about it. It's just there it is. Not wanting anything. You're already okay.

**Speaker A:** So I should, should, should, but I can't because usually I don't meditate after work because I'm so knackered.

**Speaker B:** It's okay to be tired. It's not okay to hate being tired. Okay, just enjoy. Just love it. Oh, I'm so tired. Oh, what a relief it is. I don't have to do anything right now. Oh, I can just rest. The work that needed to be done has been done, and I can rest. And so that rest is not the same as being tired. Being tired, we don't like being tired, being sluggish, thinking that I've got to go do something when in fact you don't have to. So instead of talking about it as tired, talk about it in the sense of, wow, it's nice just to rest. Let the body rest. This is nice. There's nothing happening. I don't have to do anything. You see, the tired has that quality of you've got stuff to do. And you're too knackered to do it. The resting is you got nothing to do, just rest. Isn't that upside down? I mean, that's exactly opposite of what you've been doing. That's what— people, they do it backwards. Yeah, they don't like being tired. But you can really, really enjoy, oh, just relax. Nothing to do, no place to go. You can do that at work. You're walking down the hall and you get tired, just lean up against the wall. Just.

**Speaker A:** Uh, well, at work it's usually you don't get tired when you have things to do because you're keeping you know, the Anagami up. But it's like if there's nothing to do, it's just whoops.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, just wow, I can just rest. So now we've covered two things. You can rest, and when your wife is yakking at you, you can still just rest.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Just rest. Yeah, let her do what she wants to do. You can find that God's mercy in the rest. Wow, how nice it is. Let her be in charge. Let her do any and everything that she wants to do. Look how much work it takes to resist the wife. Look how much work it is to fight with her. What a bad habit that is. Better thing to do is just let her do what she wants to do. You married her or not, you trusted her enough to marry her. Now trust her enough to run your life. So let's go ahead and finish now. Yep, we'll talk to you later.

**Speaker A:** Yep. Thank you very much.

**Speaker B:** All right, go, go have fun just relaxing. Yeah, when your wife is telling you about this, that, and the other thing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I will. Thank you again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, all right, bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** Have a great day. Bye.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, the core discussion revolves around **the careful and precise use of language in spiritual practice**, using the terms "Metta" (loving-kindness) and "love" as primary examples. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Main Theme: The Pitfalls of Loaded Language**
The speaker (Dhammarato, likely **Speaker B**) argues that words like **"love"** and even **"Metta"** are culturally overloaded with meanings that often imply **wanting, craving, or conditional attachment**. Using them carelessly can reinforce unwholesome mental states rather than pure intention.

### **Key Arguments and Teachings:**

1.  **"Metta" vs. "Love":**
    *   **"Love"** is problematic because it's frequently used in ways tied to desire, sarcasm, envy, or transaction (e.g., "I'd love for you to come to dinner" = a want). Even in relationships, saying "I love you" can be a vague placeholder that lacks the substance of true appreciation.
    *   **"Metta,"** as commonly taught (e.g., repeating phrases like "May all beings be happy"), can subtly become an expression of **dukkha** (suffering/stress) because it involves *wanting* others to be a certain way. This can be a subtle form of control or a "grandiose" wish that creates its own tension.

2.  **A Practical Alternative: Focus on Action and Specificity**
    *   Instead of using loaded terms, practice and verbalize **specific, wholesome qualities** that are less ambiguous:
        *   **Gratitude:** "Thank you for taking such good care of me."
        *   **Appreciation:** "I really appreciate what you do."
        *   **Kindness:** Simple, kind action.
        *   **Nurturing:** Caring for oneself and others without agenda.
    *   This precise language reflects and cultivates a purer, more present mind state.

3.  **The Core Principle: "Everything is okay as it is."**
    *   True "Metta" or kindness is rooted in **acceptance**—letting people be as they are without a desire to change them for your own comfort. It starts with being kind and accepting of *yourself* and your own thoughts.
    *   The practice is about cultivating a mind that sees "everything is all right" in the present moment, free from the compulsion to fix or want.

4.  **Application in Relationships (The "Mullah Nasruddin" Method):**
    *   A major practical example is applying this principle to marriage. The advice given is to practice **generosity by relinquishing control**.
    *   Let your partner make decisions, give them the "power" in the relationship. This avoids conflict and stems from a mindset of acceptance ("she's going to anyway"). When you stop fighting for control, you find peace ("rest") within the relationship.

5.  **Meditation & Correct Practice:**
    *   The same precision applies to the word "meditation." The speaker prefers **"correct practice."**
    *   Even states of tiredness can be part of correct practice. Instead of resisting fatigue with the thought "I'm too tired to meditate," reframe it as an opportunity: **"It's nice to rest. I don't have to do anything. This is peaceful."** This turns a potential obstacle into a mindful experience of acceptance.

6.  **The Dharma is "Pay It Forward":**
    *   The teaching is shared not as a business transaction, but as a gift received from one's own teachers (like his Ajahn Po) and now offered freely to others—like sharing fire from your hearth to light another's.

### **Conclusion of the Talk's Message:**
The essence of the talk is **mindfulness of language as a direct mirror of mental state.** By cleaning up and being intentional with our words—replacing vague, desire-laden terms like "love" and "Metta" with specific, action-oriented, and accepting language like "gratitude," "appreciation," and "kindness"—we cultivate a more peaceful, accepting, and wholesome mind. This practice then naturally extends into how we relate to others, leading to less conflict and more ease, both in spiritual practice and in daily life.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the talk uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate its points about language, relationships, and practice:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **Loaded Language as a "Packed" or "Loaded Down" Word:** The words "love" and "meditation" are described as being "loaded down with all kinds of stuff" or "so packed with stuff." This metaphor paints them as containers overloaded with cultural baggage, misleading meanings, and personal agendas, making them imprecise or dangerous to use.
2.  **Fire / Paying Forward:** This is the central metaphor for how Dharma is transmitted.
    > "It'd be like fire. You go to the neighbor's house because the middle of the night your fire went out... you get some coals... you can't pay him back because he's already got a fire. But if somebody comes to your house needing fire, you give them some of the coals out of your fireplace."
    This illustrates that spiritual guidance is a gift to be passed on ("paying forward"), not a commercial transaction ("paying back").
3.  **Buttering Up:** The phrase "buttering up" is used to describe a manipulative use of "love": "Love generally has the quality of I want something... the quality of buttering up. That men often butter up their wife so that he can get something that he wants." It frames "I love you" as a greasy, insincere tool for manipulation.
4.  **The Pill:** Metta, as commonly taught, is compared to a forced medication: "here's your pill that I've just manufactured, take it and feel better, or else." This metaphor criticizes the approach of wanting others to change for our own comfort.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **The Catty Compliment:** A short story of two women at a party where one says, "don't you just love her dress?" The speaker points out this often carries "envy or maybe just catty sarcasm," demonstrating how the word "love" is frequently used insincerely.
2.  **The Forced Apology:** The story of "Mommy says, go tell Aunt Susie you're sorry" is used to show how the word "sorry" (like "love") can be an empty, coerced social ritual rather than a genuine expression.
3.  **Mullah Nasruddin Story:** A longer, illustrative story about relationships and generosity.
    > "The townsman came to the Mullah and says, what do you do? And he says, I only do important things... my wife does all the unimportant stuff, like what house we have... what car we have... She takes care of all the unimportant stuff. And then they said, well, Mullah, what is the important stuff? ...can I be happy right now?"
    This story teaches the principle of relinquishing control in a relationship (giving away "all the unimportant stuff") as a path to peace and harmony, framing it as a form of deep generosity.
4.  **Personal Stories with Ajahn Po:** The speaker shares several personal anecdotes about his teacher, Ajahn Po:
    *   Waiting at the gate in the dark saying, "where have you been? I have been waiting for you."
    *   Magically appearing at 3:30 AM when the speaker returned from a trip.
    *   Silently standing in the yard of his kuti, waiting to be noticed.
    These stories are not just biographical; they serve as **parables of genuine, attentive care**—the embodied alternative to the loaded word "love." They show what unconditional, present, and patient mentorship looks like in action, which is the foundation for the "paying forward" metaphor.
5.  **The Robber Barons & Bill Gates:** The anecdote about wealthy industrialists (Carnegie, Ford) and modern figures like Bill Gates contrasts two types of wealth: the unhappy billionaire seeking more (rockets, Mars) and the one who finds joy in philanthropic generosity (curing diseases). This supports the point that happiness comes from giving, not acquiring.

### **Overall Narrative**
The talk itself follows a **story-like arc**: It starts by deconstructing common but problematic words ("love," "metta," "sorry"), uses metaphors and cautionary tales to show their dangers, and then offers an alternative path. This path is illustrated through the positive story of Mullah Nasruddin, the personal model of Ajahn Po, and the guiding metaphor of "paying forward" the Dharma like sharing fire. It concludes with practical, immediate advice for the listener's life (resting when tired, letting his wife lead), bringing the philosophical discussion full circle to daily application.
