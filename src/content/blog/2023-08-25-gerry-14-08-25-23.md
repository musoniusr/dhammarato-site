### Transcript


**Speaker A:** That.

**Speaker B:** Okay, go ahead and ask me what you wanted to ask me.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Gordon, I need to find something here. Yeah, I'm thinking in terms of thinking about stuff that one finds on the internet about the what do they call it, the dukkha jhanas, the realization of dukkha and this sort of fear and anxiety and disgust and all this that people like people in the Mahayana method and following that 16-step path tend to say that they have to get. I mean, Daniel Ingram, as I remember what he wrote, seemed to get that realization every time he got an arising and passing away, he got the Dukkha, the Hinayana, and he had to go through all that and come out of it again, come out of it the other end, blah, blah. Now, obviously, in the suttas, you don't get that. That seems to be all in the commentaries, fair enough.

**Speaker B:** But actually, it does have a root in the suttas, and we'll talk about it in a moment. Go ahead.

**Speaker A:** I'm just saying, because I'm questioning whether in some sense, when I find myself, which I do quite a lot, because I sort of meditate to get out of it in a general feeling of, oh, you know, free-floating worry, anxiety, the usual stuff that everybody I think has. I mean, is that something like a realization of Dukkha, or is it just free-floating anxiety and all that?

**Speaker B:** Well, it depends upon whether you like it or not. The way that you talk about it using the word anxiety is more than likely people are generally not going to like it.

**Speaker A:** No one doesn't like it. One doesn't like it at all. That's, I mean, that's largely, well, in many ways, that's why one sits down, meditates in order to calm the anxiety.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And, you know, although it tends to be that then you think of it, well, this is the sort of standard, what do you call it, hindrances, sort of worry and even remorse for the past, worry for the future, that sort of thing. That you get in the suttas. And I also, having read that, I was looking at stuff generally, and I found on Brazington's site a reference to a piece by somebody called Bhante Sona in one of the monasteries in America about the nimitta that some people seem— Nimitta. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Nimitta.

**Speaker A:** Nimitta that people seem to be very keen on. And this Sunyata has a very good—.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, misguided but keen.

**Speaker A:** Sorry?

**Speaker B:** Misguided but keen. In fact, you could say, going back to that original point that we were talking about, the music— when you go to that concert and hear that music, you've gotten it because it was input. But then you go and you repeat that piece of music, and not only that, but it's bits and pieces and often rearranged, moved around, repeated in different ways, etc., like that, so that what you're remembering is not exactly what was played, especially note by note, because we tend to remember the melody line and we don't remember all of the other stuff that was going on that supported why it was so beautiful. It was the harmonies behind it that made it beautiful. But when we remember it, we only remember basically the line of the melody. Okay, where I'm coming from with all of this just recently is that that is a nemata.

**Speaker A:** Is that right?

**Speaker B:** Right, that's exactly it. It's a verbal nimitta.

**Speaker A:** Well, they seem to be very keen on having it as a sort of something in your head or some sort of piece of concentrated something.

**Speaker B:** It's not real.

**Speaker A:** The metaphors.

**Speaker B:** When you were in front of that orchestra, sitting in those concert seats in that concert hall, everything was real. When you're humming that tune in the beginning and then humming it later, getting it all mixed up, and then humming it even more and not liking it so much, that none of that's real. Yeah, it's all in the head. That's the nematode. Nematodes then, by definition, are not real.

**Speaker A:** Because it's unreal, that's why I was asking if it was— if it was— if it was— what do you call it— unsatisfactory, not unwholesome.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, it depends. That in fact, if you're having wholesome thoughts and those thoughts are wholesome, if you're having unwholesome thoughts, those are unwholesome. Right? But neither one of them are actually real.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, okay.

**Speaker B:** And also the Buddha talks about it in the fact that the mind is the forerunner. So if the mind is having unwholesome thoughts, then the likelihood it'll break out into speech, just like someone who is thinking about music will break out in song or break out in humming.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Well, okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. So the next step then is, under ordinary situations, would be actions. For instance, people who are— let us use the word radicalized— they think horrible thoughts about an individual, maybe a politician, and then they'll put something on the internet, on social media, sort of threatening the guy. And that's when the FBI starts getting interested. If you're out there actually threatening, why? Because the next thing after the threats is the action. Of course, doing it right. Okay. So that's the sequence is thought, speech, action. And in that process, we're beginning to build up habits. Because it takes a whole lot of thinking about something in order to get up and act upon it. It's very rarely, for instance, if you think of getting something to eat, you'll think about getting something to eat a dozen or more times. Or if you've got to go out and travel to get something to eat, maybe 100 times you're thinking about eating before you actually eat. But if you never thought about eating at all, if it never occurred to you at all, then the likelihood is that you're not gonna wind up eating.

**Speaker A:** Okay?

**Speaker B:** So, those thoughts can be wholesome or unwholesome. For instance, someone on a diet and thinking about food a lot, that's an unwholesome thing because it's interfering with his diet and it also makes him feel bad because he's not got the food that he wants. He doesn't have the strong determination. He doesn't have the wholesome thoughts of, gosh darn it, I can do that diet. I'll leave that stuff alone. I can do this. As opposed to having poor me, oh, I'm so hungry kind of thoughts. Okay, so we can think about any particular thing and have either wholesome or unwholesome thoughts about it. And the unwholesome thoughts are generally going to lead to Dukkha. If not already Dukkha by definition.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** So let's get back to the point that you were talking about. Let us say the soft approach versus the hard approach versus the absolutely really hard approach. The Buddha in Sutta 20 in the Majjhima Nikāya actually mentions 5 ways to practice. The first way is generally the most beneficial, and it also is the one that should be done the most often. Only occasionally should we revert to the rest of them. Okay, and that is in the sense of the Eightfold Noble Path talks about changing our thoughts from unwholesome to wholesome, and in its companion, the Anapanasati Sutta, talks about gladdening the mind.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so that's the first step, and it's the most important one, and it's the one that I generally teach from. Okay, so in order to go further than this, let's talk about the sutta in the Samyutta Nikaya called The Horse Trainer. A horse trainer went to the Buddha and asked him how he trained his students, and then the Buddha talked about the horse trainer, how he trains his horses. In the sense that he starts with the soft approach, and if that doesn't work after a while, then he'll try the really rough approach. And if that doesn't work, then he'll try a combination which takes skill of the hard and the soft together— both the carrot and the stick.

**Speaker A:** Yep.

**Speaker B:** Okay. And so if the carrot doesn't work and the stick doesn't work, and the carrot and the stick don't work, then the horse trainer will kill the horse. And the Buddha says that's exactly the way that we treat our students: we try the soft approach and then the hard approach, and then the hard and the soft approach, and if that doesn't work, then the student's probably not going to get anything anyway. Generally, we're talking about those three steps take years. One, two, three, four, five years of the soft approach. But sometimes students do such outrageous behavior that you take the hard approach. The next step then of what is the introduction to the hard approach is within that Mahasi context. And that is, is that you've got to see Dukkha as really dooky. I really got to see the stuff. I mean, this is really evil. It's taunting you. And so you begin to see the bad aspects of your unwholesome thoughts. If you can't just gladden your mind out of them, then we start reflecting upon how badly I treated my sister in that argument. Okay. And that brings on a sense of guilt and remorse. And also fear, and with the fear, anxiety.

**Speaker A:** Yep.

**Speaker B:** Okay. And so the guy is now going to be on guard for any wrongdoing that he has because he knows he's going to really feel bad nowadays. In the old days, he did wrong and felt a little bit bad. Now he's going to really feel bad. Okay. And this is very much the Mahasi method. And that's why in the 16 stages of insight, it winds up being step 6 is Fearfulness, which is the anxiety.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Now, the next step after that would be misery. So we can talk about these two things in the sense that if the student is taking that hard approach and going after, "Oh, this is so terrible that I've screwed up, these thoughts are really terrible," okay, then What happens is that this can be set in as a kind of a habit, that it's only a temporary kind of thing. That in fact, in the Sutta No. 20, it moves on to the point about just relax, relaxation. And another one is to accept. You've heard me talk about the dark night of the soul. That's also one of them, is just accept that you've screwed up. Then generally the students will take that second one on all by themselves. I think that that's what's really happened to the Maharishi Method, is the students have picked up on that negative stuff and really run it into the ground. To really feel miserable when you have negative thoughts or unwholesome thoughts, but then that too, is kind of a Dukkha, that you give yourself Dukkha about Dukkha, hoping that you will avoid that Dukkha. But the soft and the hard approach would be both seeing the Dukkha as it is, seeing the unwholesome as it is, and yet accepting it. So we beat ourselves up and then we give ourselves a carrot, that we accept ourselves, warts and all. Okay, so the Buddha's actually got a fairly sophisticated method of this kind of stuff, and you can see that various systems and techniques will overemphasize one of them without even figuring out what the other possibilities are.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh.

**Speaker B:** Okay. And then in that sequence of 5, the last one on the list is where it's described as with strong determination, like— now this is a mental exercise, but it's given the metaphor of clenching one's teeth and shoving the tongue to the top of the roof of the mouth. You know, like clenching your fist and saying, "I've got to do this, I've got to do it!" OK, and so that's the way that the Buddha says, that's the final resort, is just force yourself to not have those unwholesome thoughts. In the case of what we're talking about here is a kind of a silly joke. The song that that orchestra played where everybody is enjoying it, now you played it for yourself and you really enjoyed it for a while, and then you played it and got tired of it, and now you're playing it. You want that thing out of your mind. How are you going to throw that song out of your mind if you don't want it anymore? Because you've got it ground in now.

**Speaker A:** Well, think of something else for starters.

**Speaker B:** Well, no, we're going back to the earlier things, okay? That's what we would call distraction or substitution. An example of that is, is that if dogs are growling and barking and about to fight with each other, you can distract the dog. If the dog is a ball catcher, you can start throwing balls towards the dog and get him distracted from those balls. Also, you can feed the dog, you can call the dog off, but you don't go and punish the dog. The way that the Mahasi system is set up for the students to punish themselves. It's called a distraction. Okay, so a way that we could do that with the tune then is by substituting the new tune for the old tune. Go to a different composer, a different genre, or whatever like that, but do something different. If you're playing a long, slow piece, then pick it up and put something up. You know, if you're playing a piece that's at 60, then go for 110. Get it active, turn it on. But if you're turning it on because the song you're singing is already a really active, high-tempo piece, then you want to change the song to something more subdued. All right, so you make a change, we distract ourselves, but ultimately we could also do that fifth element in the sense of every time that that song comes up, we stop. And then it plays a couple of bars or 5 minutes later, stop. Just stop it. Okay. That's the way that we can eventually get rid of it. But the substitution method, that's the winner. You can't really stop it right from the get-go. You've got to play around with this stuff. We've got to go through all 5 stages for this unwholesome stuff. And like I say, the Mahasi group gets stuck at stage 2 of the heart. That in fact, you could say that this step 5, stage 5 within one's own mind is the killing of the horse. You've got to stop! Which is completely different in the step 2 method, which is the Maharishi method of, "Oh, that's terrible! Oh, I wish I could get rid of that song!" Oh, poor me, I've got this dong suck in my head.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, you'll never get it out of your head that way.

**Speaker B:** No, that's part of the reason why the Mahasi Method is generally not successful. Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** Sure, sure. Well, I'm not doing Mahasi, I'm doing—.

**Speaker B:** You brought it up. You brought it up. Very game.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So, um, but it's also very characteristic, and it answers that question that you were having of, does that stuff come out of the suttas? The actual answer is yes, it does. And I've quoted two different suttas where that hard method is actually talked about.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Okay, does that answer that question?

**Speaker A:** Um, well, I would actually— can you give me the two suttas?

**Speaker B:** Ah, the Horse Trainer, you can just Google. The Horse— yeah, it's in the Samyutta Nikaya. So Horse Trainer, always use the word sutta when you're Googling, and that will make sure that it knows that you're not looking for Highway 47. Uh-huh. It's the MN 47 will give you not just the sutta, but it'll also give you all about Highway 47 in Minnesota.

**Speaker A:** Sure. Yeah, MN 47. Okay.

**Speaker B:** No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm just, uh, joking. When you know that, uh, that was out of sutta number 20.

**Speaker A:** This is— yeah, okay. I've, I've got, I've got I've got marked in my PDF, I've got a note so that I can find number 20 in the Majjhima Nikaya. Yeah, fine. I've got a PDF of the Nyanamoli and Bodhi translation of the Majjhima Nikaya. So that's, yeah, so I've got that one marked number 20.

**Speaker B:** But.

**Speaker A:** What was the other one apart from those?

**Speaker B:** They said Google the horse trainer Sutta.

**Speaker A:** That's not 20. Number 20 is not the horse.

**Speaker B:** No, it's in the Samyutta Nikaya someplace, I'm sure.

**Speaker A:** Okay, Samyutta Nikaya. Okay, fair enough.

**Speaker B:** Now the Samyutta Nikaya has 52 different groupings, and then each and each of those groupings, it'll have a number of suttas. So it'll be like number 74.46 or something like that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. Difficult to find. Well, not difficult to find because you can Google it, but yeah, you can.

**Speaker B:** Go— I mean, Google's the when. We can do many things with Google.

**Speaker A:** It's remarkable, isn't it? I mean, yeah, yes, time was we had to go to a library and pull down a whole lot of books.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but look at the difference in the technology. But both the library and all the books took a huge amount of effort by a huge number of people, hugely numbers of years ago to get libraries going. But with the software and the Google that we have now, have nowadays, it's just a tremendous amount of work that one person will do, and then somebody else will put something on top of that, and then somebody else will put something on top of that. I mean, basic computers, and then basic operating systems, and then connecting computers together. And I mean, there's all kinds of steps in there that eventually gives a Google search box, and then all the technology that they've been doing by crawling through the entire web as best they could to get data so that they can answer the questions. And then AI is now built upon top of that. Now that they've got access to the information, you see, one of the big problems with the AI is that you had to feed it data. Well, now the AI has got Google searching, it can go find the data.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's all quite terrifying because, are you familiar with a story called The Answer by Frederick Brown, which used to appear in science fiction anthologies? It is a very, very short story, and it's basically about the when they get all the computers in the whole galaxy linked up together, and essentially they're going to ask them, ask it the sort of final question, you know, what is the meaning of life, the universe and everything.

**Speaker B:** And it's the one where— Interesting, all of that work to get all those computers together, and then it asks it stupid questions. I get you.

**Speaker A:** So the guy steps up to it and he asks it, is there a God? And the answer comes back from the linked computers, there is now. Yep, that's the one. And then the lightning comes down, he jumps to switch it off, he leaps for the big switch and the lightning comes out of a clear sky and fuses it shut. I always think that's a great story.

**Speaker B:** Well, it is, except that it's still imaginary. It's still— and that, um, there will always be a human way to pull the plug on any machine, just like humans have the ability to pull the plug on any human machine. The example of that is, is that, uh, you know that Pregoshin just got Anagami knocked out of the sky, right?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, uh-huh. There's a clear example of it. When AI goes wrong, we'll just bomb it.

**Speaker A:** Well, yes, if it hasn't already snuck into your bombing systems, you know, the ones you're going to bomb it with. I mean, ultimately you might be reduced to coming around the back of it with an undercover Dhammarato, a lump of dynamite.

**Speaker B:** Okay, but that's the whole point, is that it's always vulnerable. Just like you and I are vulnerable.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, AI will be vulnerable. Whatever box it's running on will be vulnerable. Even if it wants the best job it can do at making itself not vulnerable, It would only do that because it's afraid. So where does the fear come from? The answer to that is that it read all about it. And so it decided that it could have feelings. Yeah, well, that's— when in fact, the feelings that you and I have are based in body chemistry. The feelings that AI have is imaginary. It's not real.

**Speaker A:** But if it can develop fear, of course, then that is when it will become dangerous.

**Speaker B:** Well, the real danger is not in the AI and the hardware itself, because that can always be shut down.

**Speaker A:** It'll be in the software that people put into it.

**Speaker B:** Well, no, it's actually the dangers have to do with the influence that the AI has upon the people before we decide to shut down because they've already done a lot of damage. So AI in fact is doing a whole lot of damage right now, and people can see it, but they're calling for shutting it down. And when— why is because, uh, the AI, like Twitter is unregulated in the sense that it can read anything; it can have both true information and false information, which is exactly like a human having both wholesome thoughts and unwholesome thoughts. So if we were better controlling what information we were feeding to the AI, then maybe we could start controlling the better reading or the better feeding of information to humans. Because I would say that the amount of false information that AI puts out is quite small compared to the false information that on social media, for instance, the humans are putting out. But in fact, one of the main reasons for having a newspaper paper so many years ago, and I'm not talking about having a newspaper delivered to your door, because everybody would do that, I'm talking about the guy who owns the newspaper, wants to own the newspaper, not to make a profit off the newspaper, but to spread his own bullshit.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dammarato] Well, of course, that is particularly apparent in Great Britain, with the the right-wing tabloids, which really are engaged in spreading huge amounts of bullshit. Everybody knows that.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so people like— don't fear, don't fear AI, fear the stuff that people are telling it.

**Speaker A:** Sure, sure.

**Speaker B:** And who is running the thing? Because you can think of the AI as very much like a social media a site or a newspaper. And that the people who want power will try to control the AI, of course. And so it's not the problem with the AI itself, it's the fact that the AI has been fed the wrong kind of information. Now, as information grows, you see, 10,000 years ago there was very little information. People did not know how to plant crops, for instance, but the information about how to plant crops spread and civilization was born. Yes, at about 3000 BC, all over the place.

**Speaker A:** Yep.

**Speaker B:** Partly because of writing, the cuneiforms and the very ancient Indian writing, and also hieroglyphs in Egypt and stuff like that that gave rise to writing. But always it was very limited because the writing had to be copied one copy at a time. So you cannot give 100 books to 100 students to read because only one guy can copy one book at a time, taking him a year or two or three. So the likelihood of teaching 100 people the stuff in one book is kind of remote. So, the Gutenberg press coming along now radicalized that, so that books actually now could be produced and handed out willy-nilly. But that's still a far cry from what the web has, because all those books now are on the web, and everybody has access to every book, to where in the old days, you had to go to a library, and that library was quite limited. In fact, the universities used to brag about how many books they had, as if that were meaning something. University of South Carolina actually bragged that they had over a million books at one time.

**Speaker A:** Well, it wasn't just the universities, I mean, Pete, well, as well as the universities, I mean, rich men, rich men would— The Anagami, right? The amount of books they had in their private library as well.

**Speaker B:** You know, that's— and the more very rare books, the better.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely. The more rare ones, the better. Of course, that's just for the sake of your prestige, except of course, in some cases it was because a lot of these guys were very highly educated in the terms of their time. Mm-hmm.

**Speaker B:** You know, they had a lot of the stuff in those books was still half of it was wholesome and half of it was unwholesome, or some percentage, but it was never, ever a book that was really good. Like for instance, some people think that the Bible is really, really, really, really good. Oh, I know one, it's full of— Blindly inspired. And yet anybody who's got an education can read the thing and say, "Hey, this is a mixed bag at best.".

**Speaker A:** Yes, there's a very amusing thing out there on copied around the place, a monologue by an American comedienne called Julia Sweeney about it, called Letting Go of God. And really, the story starts with the fact that she decides when the Mormons come around and say, here's a Book of Mormon, read it. So she reads it and says, oh dear, this is the purest nonsense, you see. So then she goes along and she says, well, I'll read the Bible and see what I think of that. That, and she sort of realizes, wait a minute, this is full of, again, the purest nonsense and so on. And so, of course, it's done as a stage performance. It's very funny. She's very funny with it, but she has some telling points.

**Speaker B:** Right. So if we go all the way and extrapolate all the way using that 50-50, The Bible is 50/50. Most novels are 50/50. Most of the books in the Library of Congress are 50/50. The internet now is like 50/50. So our AI is going to be like 50/50. It's going to be a mixture of wholesome and unwholesome stuff, a mixture of true stuff and a mixture of garbage.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but actually Where do you get 50/50 from?

**Speaker B:** I didn't, I just made that up.

**Speaker A:** I mean, and he said that 90% is crap.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's probably more correct, isn't it? I would be very friendly there.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Oh dear.

**Speaker B:** Well, all right. So this is the whole business then about practicing Anapanasati, practicing meditation, is that how do we determine within our own mind what's wholesome what's not wholesome. And how do we deal with it? The first way that we deal with it is by giving the dog a cookie. Distract your dog with something delightful. Gladden the mind. Tell ourselves we can feel good, we can feel happy, we don't have to feel bad, we don't have to give ourselves all that work to do. We can just enjoy the moment. And then there's the other way, the harder way, which is you got to examine this stuff and see what detriment it is. When you figure out that it is not a good idea to complain to that guy at that office, I mean, you bought his services and he's not delivering. If you go give him a hard time, the likelihood of him continuing to not deliver is very high. But also, he may not deliver if you go off and be sweet-talk. Eventually, you may have to walk out of the place. So this is the way, but the way to start it is by sweet-talking, not grabbing him by the collar. That's where the place— I think that's where the mob goes wrong, in the sense that even when they're being sweet-talking, there's a threat in it. Yes, it's a mix, of course.

**Speaker A:** Of course. Okay.

**Speaker B:** And so that's the third method that the Buddha gives, is the mixing of the two, of to see the dangers and to come out of it. And the fourth is kind of like, forget it, forget all about it, in the sense of just relax. Yeah, let's just, just, you know, let's forget about it. Okay, and the fourth one then, or the fifth one, sorry, is the mobster actually bombs the storefront. So these are the various ways that we have of practicing, but the one by far that gives the best benefit is the sweet diversion. Gladdening the mind, brightening the mind, come out of that anxiety.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** By having happy, wholesome thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Give him the carrot.

**Speaker A:** Now, you see, I'm going to start giving you some doubt here.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, you do already. And we can always remember to take the middle path.

**Speaker A:** Of course.

**Speaker B:** Okay, because almost always the doubts are way over on the far extreme of what I'm talking about.

**Speaker A:** But your method, the thing you constantly repeat, is do it over and over again. Right now, isn't this sort of fake it till you make it?

**Speaker B:** Well, Sometimes, faking it until you're making it works, and sometimes, fake it till you make it makes you a charlatan. Or you could say that maybe it's even possible to be the charlatan until you finally do make it, because you've talked yourself into it over and over and over again. Or, a way of thinking it is that Some magic tricks are easy, easy, easy, and they'll get really, really elaborate around an easy trick. For instance, squeezing a bottle till it goes to nothing is because you've been able to distract your person, get them to look down, and then you throw the bottle away, or you throw it to somebody catching it so that it doesn't make any noise. Okay, many of them are like that. Also, some of the diversions in the one that I'm getting to is like a lot of card tricks require the skill that they have to build playing with that deck of cards and playing with that deck of cards and learning to shuffle and learning to shuffle and learning to shuffle so that you can begin to control the shuffling that you're doing and you develop the skill for it. Okay, so if you're talking to yourself in the sense of faking it until you're making it, but you're not developing any skills along the way, then you're just going to remain a charlatan. But you can develop the skills for.

**Speaker A:** It.

**Speaker B:** For doing what you— and the skill that we're talking about doing here, one of the many of the skills that we're talking about, is to gladden the mind. Thus one trains oneself to gladden the mind.

**Speaker A:** Indeed, indeed.

**Speaker B:** So let's gladden your mind right now.

**Speaker A:** Well, yes, I mean— Yeah, there it goes, see?

**Speaker B:** Sure, sure, you can do it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, but you see, look, what I'm saying is the doubt I'm raising, this one, is that it seems that one is, you know, the whole point of All this meditation and all this Anapanasati and all this Buddhism is to induce ultimately in the mind a kind of complete step change in how you look at things, a complete change. Now, your method, you can't get out.

**Speaker B:** Of the sutras, the method in the.

**Speaker A:** Sutras, but it's It's sort of keep on doing this, but how do you— will you— you know, it's not going to produce a step change or a major paradigm shift.

**Speaker B:** It changes immediately and it major changes, just like when I said to you, and let's do it again, let's gladden the mind and see that in fact it— see, already Can you do that? Can you remember to gladden the mind and then do it? Because not only are we building it as a skill to remember to do it, but we get the immediate benefit of it right then and there. Yeah, sure, that's the whole point, is can we get it right then and there?

**Speaker A:** Well, yep.

**Speaker B:** And never mind about the future, because in the future you have that choice if you can remember. Let's get it back on. Let's drop that anxiety. Let's drop all of our problems. Well, what a relief it is.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, of course you can, you can You can do that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, see, there you go again. You can do that. That's the whole point.

**Speaker A:** But it doesn't avoid the fact that the shit, you know, there's still shit out there going to hit the fan at some point.

**Speaker B:** But if you can develop this, then when the shit hits the fan, you can know it's coming and you can stand away from the fan. You don't have to sit there and get stuff all over you because you think that it's your fan. When that your— that their shit hits. Okay, so let the shit hit the fan. It's not your fan. Get out of its way. Stand aside. Hold your nose. Clean your clothes.

**Speaker A:** Well, yeah, but how are you going to apply that to age, sickness, and death?

**Speaker B:** Well, Shitting the fan would be old age. Shitting the fan would be sickness. Yeah, hitting the fan big time when the whole fan is completely covered with shit is death, right? No more. It's not a fan anymore. It's a great big pile of shit with something that we thought was the fan buried in it. All right, so that's the whole thing, is, is that what is shit hitting the fan to you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Can the body be sick and allow the body to be sick, but you're still happy, joyful?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Old age can sit in. Just called old age sits in doesn't mean that I have to be miserable and unhappy because I desire being useful. But it works the other way too. The Buddha talks about this, that in fact I wrote a poem about it out of a sutra. I forget what sutra it is, but the little poem goes: Pride, pride for being alive. Why am I proud for being alive? Because dead, dead, I'm going to be dead. So why should I have pride for being alive? OK, so that's one of them of the three. Young, young, being young. I love being young, but I'm going to get old, so why should I have pride? Pride for being young. And you see that all the time. The younger said, oh, old man, you don't know shit, right? Guess what? He may know more than that young one does, but the kids have pride for being young, and yet they're not going to stay young. They're going to get old.

**Speaker A:** Ah, well, I suppose you could also say, and it's equally, presumably it's equally bad to say pride, pride for being old, because I know a lot of shit that I didn't know when I was younger.

**Speaker B:** Well, now we're getting closer to being real though, because now you have something to be proud of.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Maybe. Where in the other case, the kids are proud of being alive, are proud of being young, to where they're going to lose that, and they're going to get old. Maybe if they're lucky, they'll get old with wisdom, but most old people are in the Republican Party, which pretty well proves no wisdom there.

**Speaker A:** All the conservatives in my case.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that's the whole point about the word conservative. I've mused over that. What that means, conservative, is that I don't have enough.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, sure.

**Speaker B:** I don't. I got to keep what I've got. That's why really rich people are very conservative. Why? Because they're so greedy for more and more money. They don't want to pay taxes. It takes wisdom. But most people are conservative because they want to hang on to what they've got. Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** Of course.

**Speaker B:** Like old programmers. Really love their old languages and they don't want to learn the new PHPs and the new languages. Because in the old ways, we always had this context like this happens before that and this happens after that. Within the way that the web works is that, oh, you got to do this first and then you do the first thing. And so things are out of order and whatnot. And so the old programmers get confused and they don't like it. So basically, the conservative is the one who is feeling like he is a loser and that the liberals are the ones who are giving stuff away. They're very liberal with things because they have the feeling that they have enough. Now, both can go to the extreme. In the sense that the liberals will spend too much money, to where the Republicans, they don't want to spend any money at all. They want to keep it.

**Speaker A:** Yep. Yep.

**Speaker B:** And so they don't, they don't want to pay taxes. They don't want to do this. They don't want to do that. And so this is the— so basically it's a question of how are we going to grow old? Are we going to grow old still thinking we don't have enough, or are we going to ever come to the point of being successful, real success? Not the success of being the boss of a company, or success of being the big preacher in the Southern Baptist Convention, or any of the things where you look that success is built upon some competition and beating somebody else at something. That's just competition. Real success is when we stop competing.

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm. Oh yeah.

**Speaker B:** Well, and we can practice that right there with Anapanasati. So we're having thoughts of competing with somebody. Those are unwholesome thoughts. Let's change that to, oh, well, he's a good friend of mine. I don't have to compete with him. I don't have to show him anything.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** And we practice that over and over again to get those unwholesome thoughts under control. Yeah. So we can do it with the carrot, we can do it with the stick. Yeah. We could do it with the carrot and the stick. We could just forget all about it and relax, or we could beat the tar out of it.

**Speaker A:** Usually just relaxing is the— is, is the best way. Yeah, I reckon.

**Speaker B:** If you've already got good control over it so that you actually can relax.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the point. That's the point. And in fact, yeah, that, now that I find just on a simple matter of practice. I mean, I know that the sutta starts with long breaths. And then short breaths. But sometimes it is good to do the short breaths, which pumps up the chest, and then it automatically shades into the longer breaths. And that actually, that's just a sort of something that I found when I'm doing it. You know, it gets the mind onto the breathing better than trying to start with the long breath.

**Speaker B:** What a marvelous distraction from all of our uptight, unwholesome thoughts, not paying attention to the breath. And the anxiety is actually a chemical situation that has a lot of carbon dioxide in the blood. So breathing actually changes the blood chemistry and changes the body chemistry, which also changes the chemistry of the mind. Getting all of the junk out.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so we can do it with either the long breath or the short breath. You can actually think of that the long breath is actually the carrot and the short breath is the stick. But either one of them, or in combination of the two, will actually then clean out the blood. In a way of also cleaning out the mind, both with the blood chemistry and also of the thoughts. But this, after we have to practice, because if we forget about it, we'll just go back into the unwholesome thoughts and the shallow breathing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Well, so we have to practice over and over and over again to do this. Never mind, start again. It's not me that just teaches that repetition. There you go with Goenka. Never mind, start again. Just do it again. Pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and start all over again. That's how you learn to ride a bicycle. If you fall off that bicycle and get hurt— in fact, it was before bicycles, it was horses— if a kid falls off the horse, a good daddy will put that kid back on that horse if he doesn't have to go to the hospital. When the kid falls over the course, there's only two possibilities. One, he's got to go to the hospital, and if he doesn't have to go to the hospital, he gets back on that course.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, well, yeah.

**Speaker B:** But you don't let the kid go sulk under a tree.

**Speaker A:** This always takes me back to all these old, old sort of Western movies where you have all the wonderful.

**Speaker B:** Quotes.

**Speaker A:** You can mine out of them, you know, that 'Guess a man needs to get back on his horse.'.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right. Well, Anapanasati students, they need to get back on that breath.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

**Speaker B:** There's another one out of the Old West: 'Two wrongs don't make a right,' which is the same as the whataboutisms that you find in politics. Oh, you're coming after me and giving me four charges? Well, what about him? Yeah, you know, well, it doesn't matter whether he's wrong or not. Biden can be totally wrong, but that doesn't make it okay for you. Sure, that his wrong doesn't make your wrongs right. Two wrongs don't make a right. They need to put that back in the movies.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes. Well, I don't— good. Well, fine. That we should probably— we've had— I've taken up an hour of your time.

**Speaker B:** So that's so much fun, though. Are you having fun yet? Well, yes, but look at all the stuff that we've covered. I mean, we've gotten actually an important point out is in the fact that there are more than one way of practice, but they've got a rational and a procedure behind it, and that we can see that both in Sutta 20 and in the Horse Trainer Sutta. So you wouldn't say that only one practice will do, that in fact we do need both the carrot and the stick, but we have to learn how to apply them. For instance, if you've got a donkey, pulling your cart and you dangle that carrot in front of him, that donkey is going to go most of the time. But sometimes you've got to take that carrot off that stick and whack the donkey with it. There's also the point from that is that a well-trained horse only needs to see the shadow of the whip. You know, they had whip stands and things like that, and so long as the whip is in the stand, the horse knows that. But if that driver gets that whip out of the stand, the horse is going to start running faster without the whip having actually been used.

**Speaker A:** So Pavlov and the salivating dogs.

**Speaker B:** Precisely right. Okay, so that horse was trained.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So that he responds to even the shadow of a whip. This is actually how we can train our minds so that even the shadow of Dukkha and hot, we're out of here.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yes, we can see it coming. If we can see that, uh, whip coming out of its, uh, stand, then we know it's time to do something. Before the whip is put into action. In other words, the shit hitting the fan. So if you know that, why don't we hide the fan?

**Speaker A:** Indeed.

**Speaker B:** Or better than that, why don't we pay more attention to where that shit's coming from?

**Speaker A:** Indeed. Of course, right?

**Speaker B:** So this is your method. That we've got more than one method, that we've got the hard, we've got the soft, we've got the soft and the hard, and then we've got the strangle, and we have the relaxation. Good. And you can use any one of them at any time that you remember that you've got choices like this.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. Okay, okay.

**Speaker B:** All right, Gary, this has been a great call. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Well, thank you, thank you. It's always fun. Um, yeah, okay.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, we'll see you soon then.

**Speaker A:** Yep. Okay, cheers then. Bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** Give you a carrot. All right.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) in conversation with a Sangha friend (Speaker A, Gary), covers several interconnected themes in Buddhist practice, with a central focus on **how to skillfully deal with unwholesome thoughts, anxiety, and the "hard" vs. "soft" approaches to meditation.**

Here is a structured summary of the key points:

### **Core Question & Theme**
The talk begins with Gary's question about the "dukkha ñāṇas" (insight knowledges of suffering)—intense stages of fear, misery, and disgust described in some modern meditation systems (e.g., Mahasi, Daniel Ingram). He wonders if his everyday "free-floating anxiety" is a form of this or just ordinary hindrances.

### **Main Teachings from Dhammarato**

1.  **The Root in the Suttas:** Dhammarato confirms that the "hard" approach of contemplating suffering *does* have a basis in the suttas, but it is just **one of several tools** and not the primary or recommended starting point.

2.  **The Five-Fold Framework from MN 20:** The core of the talk is the explanation of **five ways to remove unwholesome thoughts**, as taught by the Buddha in the Majjhima Nikāya (Sutta 20):
    *   **1. The Soft Approach (The Carrot):** The **primary and most beneficial method**. This is "gladdening the mind," replacing unwholesome thoughts with wholesome, joyful ones. It's the foundation of the practice Dhammarato emphasizes.
    *   **2. The Hard Approach (The Stick):** Seeing the real danger and drawbacks of unwholesome thoughts, leading to feelings of shame, fear, and anxiety about them. This is the method that systems like Mahasi can over-emphasize, getting practitioners stuck in the "dukkha ñāṇas."
    *   **3. The Combined Approach (Carrot & Stick):** Skillfully mixing both—seeing the danger but also practicing self-acceptance ("warts and all").
    *   **4. The Relaxation Approach:** Simply letting go, forgetting about the struggle, and relaxing the mind.
    *   **5. The Suppression Approach (Strong Determination):** As a last resort, using forceful determination to stop the thoughts, like clenching one's teeth.

3.  **The Analogy of the Horse Trainer Sutta:** This sutta (from the Samyutta Nikāya) mirrors the five methods. A trainer uses softness, then harshness, then a mix, and finally, if nothing works, "kills the horse" (analogous to the forceful suppression method). The key is to start soft and use the harsh methods sparingly and skillfully.

4.  **On Nimitta and "The Tune in the Head":** The discussion uses the analogy of a song (nimitta) stuck in your head. The remembered tune is not the real concert experience—it's a mental fabrication. Similarly, most of our anxious thoughts are unreal mental constructs. The solution isn't to fight them (which reinforces them) but to **distract and substitute** with a better "tune" (wholesome thought), which is the soft approach.

5.  **Practical Application to Anxiety:**
    *   **Anxiety is an unwholesome state.** The goal is not to wallow in it as "insight into dukkha," but to work with it skillfully.
    *   **First, always try the soft approach:** Gladden the mind. Breathe consciously (long or short breaths change blood chemistry and calm the system). This provides immediate relief and builds the skill of happiness.
    *   This practice of repeated substitution ("start again") is not "faking it," but **skill development**. It's like learning to ride a bike; you fall and get back on.

6.  **Broader Context: AI, Information, and the Mind:** The conversation digresses to compare the mind to AI. Both are fed a mix of wholesome and unwholesome information (like the 50/50 mix of truth/falsehood on the internet). The danger isn't the "machine" (mind or AI) itself, but the **unwholesome input it's given and habitually feeds itself.** Meditation practice is the training to curate that internal input.

### **Key Takeaways**
*   **Prioritize the "Carrot":** The main practice is to cultivate joy, gladden the mind, and distract oneself from unwholesome states with wholesome ones. This is Anapanasati.
*   **The "Stick" Has a Place, But Use Carefully:** Contemplating suffering is a valid tool for when the soft approach isn't enough, but it's easy to get stuck there. It's not the primary path.
*   **You Have a Toolkit:** A skilled practitioner has all five methods from MN 20 at their disposal and knows which to apply and when.
*   **Practice is Immediate:** The benefit of gladdening the mind is not a distant "paradigm shift"; it's a relief and skill you can access **right now**, which then builds resilience for when "the shit hits the fan" (aging, sickness, death).
*   **Repetition is Training:** The instruction to "start again" is not a failure but the essential process of building the mental habit of choosing wholesome states.

**In essence,** Dhammarato steers the practice away from seeking or valorizing difficult, fear-based insights and toward a more accessible, joyful, and sustainable path rooted in the earliest Buddhist texts, using anxiety itself as the starting point for applying the Buddha's gentle, gradual training.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this conversation, the primary metaphors and stories used are:

**1. The Horse Trainer (from the Samyutta Nikaya)**
*   **What it illustrates:** The Buddha's graduated teaching methods, adapted to the student.
*   **How it's used:** Speaker B explains that a trainer starts with a soft approach, then a rough approach, then a combination, and finally, if nothing works, may "kill the horse." This parallels how a teacher tries gentle encouragement, stern warnings, a mix of both, and finally may give up on a completely unreachable student. This story is used to validate the "hard approach" of contemplating suffering (*dukkha*) found in some meditation methods.

**2. The Earworm / Replayed Music**
*   **What it illustrates:** The nature of a *nimitta* (a mental sign or image) and the unreality of proliferated thought.
*   **How it's used:** Speaker B compares hearing a beautiful piece of music live (reality) to later replaying and corrupting the memory of it in your head (a *nimitta*). The replayed tune is "not real"—it's a mental construct that can become tiresome or unwholesome. This metaphor explains how thoughts, even about pleasant things, are ultimately insubstantial and can lead to suffering if clung to.

**3. The Carrot and the Stick**
*   **What it illustrates:** The spectrum of methods for dealing with unwholesome thoughts, from gentle to forceful.
*   **How it's used:** This is a direct extension of the Horse Trainer story. The "carrot" represents gladdening the mind and substituting wholesome thoughts (the primary, soft approach). The "stick" represents the "hard approach" of rigorously examining the drawbacks of unwholesome thoughts to generate dispassion. A skilled trainer (or meditator) knows when to use which.

**4. The Well-Trained Horse and the Whip's Shadow**
*   **What it illustrates:** The goal of developing mindful sensitivity and pre-emptive action.
*   **How it's used:** Speaker B extends the horse metaphor to describe an ideal state of awareness. A well-trained horse responds to the mere *shadow* of the whip, avoiding the lash altogether. Similarly, a well-trained mind learns to see the *early signs* of suffering (*dukkha*) arising and can let go of unwholesome thoughts *before* they cause full-blown anxiety or distress.

**5. Shit Hitting the Fan**
*   **What it illustrates:** The inevitable unpleasant experiences of life (aging, sickness, conflict).
*   **How it's used:** Speaker A raises the objection that gladdening the mind doesn't solve real-world problems. Speaker B agrees that "shit" (suffering) will inevitably hit the "fan" (your life). The practice's value is in learning to "stand away from the fan"—to not identify with the suffering or let it define your mental state, even while dealing with it.

**6. The Dog (Distraction/Substitution)**
*   **What it illustrates:** The method of distracting the mind from unwholesome patterns.
*   **How it's used:** Briefly mentioned, the idea of distracting a dog about to fight with a ball or food parallels the meditation technique of substituting a wholesome thought or object of attention (like the breath) for an unwholesome one, rather than engaging in a direct, punishing struggle with it.

**7. The Charlatan / "Fake it till you make it"**
*   **What it illustrates:** The potential pitfall and the genuine skill-building aspect of the "gladden the mind" practice.
*   **How it's used:** Speaker A questions if constantly redirecting thoughts to happier ones is just self-deception. Speaker B reframes it: if done without skill, it's charlatanism; but if done as a deliberate practice to *build the skill* of gladdening the mind, it becomes a genuine path to change, just like a magician practices shuffling until it becomes a real skill.

**8. Falling Off the Horse / Bicycle**
*   **What it illustrates:** The necessity of repetition and gentle persistence in practice.
*   **How it's used:** To counter frustration, Speaker B compares meditation to learning to ride. When you fall off (lose focus, get anxious), the correct response isn't to sulk but to simply "get back on the horse" (return to the breath) and try again. This reinforces the core instruction of non-judgmental persistence.

**Summary:** The talk uses a central cluster of metaphors **(Horse Trainer, Carrot/Stick, Whip's Shadow)** to frame the Buddha's pedagogical flexibility. The **Music/Nimitta** metaphor explains the nature of thought. The **Shit-Hitting-the-Fan** metaphor addresses existential suffering, while the **Dog, Charlatan, and Falling Off the Horse** metaphors address practical, day-to-day challenges in meditation practice. All are used to advocate for a responsive, skillful, and primarily gentle ("gladdening") approach to working with the mind.
