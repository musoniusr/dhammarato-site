### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So welcome, friends. Today is February 1st. It's Tam's birthday, and that it's Sunday afternoon here in Thailand, and that today's talk is going to be on— well, let's just use the topic of not sure, which is a typical answer that's given around on our Dhamma group, Dhamma Friends on Discord. What not sure comes from is that Arahant Po would say that on a regular basis to me. But in fact, he would walk up out of the blue, almost sneak up on me, and just say, "Not sure," and then leave or walk away. Sometimes also he would say, "Tathagata," which is closely related. Now, Tathagata can be translated as Here now, it's often translated out of the old days as thusness, which we would say thisness, and that is also translated as just like that. Now, Ajahn Chah, so I have heard in recent times, he was famous for going around saying not sure. And since Achan Chah and Achan Poh knew each other, associated with each other, maybe one picked it up from the other. I have a suspicion that Achan Poh started it, but I have no evidence, just the timeframe back in the early 1980s is when he was using it. With me. So let's look into not sure. Um, first off, let's reiterate or talk again about, uh, ordinary reality, ordinary culture, mundane life, mundane existence, the way that most people live. And then when the Buddha came along, before that there was only ordinary reality, and he came in and started looking at noble reality, which is supramundane. Now, supramundane means above, and that often people will confuse supramundane with supernatural. Actually, supernatural and everything about supernatural belongs in the ordinary world, including magic concepts, belief systems, and all of that kind of stuff that you will find in ordinary culture, including politics. To where in the noble We come out of the ordinary mundane and go into a noble mindset. Within that frame of reference, we can see that it's noble to say "not sure," where in ordinary language a person would say, "In my opinion," or "I think so." And that basically what we learned from the teaching of dependent origination and Paticcasamuppada is that perception is the act of taking old information that we already have accumulated in memory and stick it with the new senses that we've come up with in present moment. And come up with understanding. Now, I'm being very polite when I say understanding, but that's the goal. The goal is to understand or to make sense out of what we've just seen, heard, felt, touched, tasted, experienced. But a sloppy but very funny way of saying it, instead of saying understanding, we can say they make up a story, or they made that shit up. And that the phrase not sure comes in with that, that whenever we perceive something, make sense out of it and understand it, the ordinary mind will think they know. And thinking that they know, they will also think This is mine. And so not sure actually cuts through that. Now, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talked about two kinds of language, and two kinds of language basically is the ordinary language that he called balloon language, and then Dhamma language he called knife language. And that's why I'm using the phrase cut through. I don't know is one way of saying it, but just not sure is cutting through all of our perceptions, all of our stories, everything that we think is true. So we get out of opinions. Now, ordinary reality is absolutely full of beliefs. Some of the beliefs are thousands of years old. Some of them are 2,000 years old, some of them are more recent, but people think that they're 2,000 years old. And that because children are taught things by their parents, the children, in fact all children, we are kind of open and receptive, which means that the child is going to not discriminate between the crap that people tell them and the facts that people tell them. This is basic ignorance, is that when we are born, we are in a basic state of ignorance. And so we take in beliefs and religions and stories that we have been told throughout our lives as if it were fact without um, let's say doing any examination. Now, the whole point of the noble Dharma is to examine, to look. So I continued to talk because I was sure that there was internet, and yet little, uh, question marks started showing up on everybody, uh, and so not sure. Now it looks like that we've got internet again. So we were talking about God in the sense of whether we know anything or not, and the best thing to say is we're not sure. But one that's a little closer to home would be about rebirth and reincarnation, and some people say there is rebirth, and others will say there is no rebirth. The Buddha used a particular way of talking about rebirth, but most of the people will say, okay, the Buddha taught about rebirth, but then they think that he's talking about something else, talking about not the rebirth of bad habits in the mind. He is supposedly talking about a physical rebirth. But the reality is nobody knows. Is anybody here sure one way or the other that there is rebirth into the next life, any reincarnation or not? Does anybody know? Nobody knows. Not only does nobody here know, but nobody here knows anybody who does know. Nobody knows. Why can't we be honest? Well, in the noble sense, the honesty would be, we don't know, rather than assuming, let us say logically, or what we know about physics, biology, it's impossible. But the reality is, is that physics and biology may be wrong. We don't know. Taking it from the perspective of we don't know, or better stated, not sure one way or the other, is the more noble way of looking at things. But we can apply that to not big lofty concepts like rebirth and reincarnation. We can apply that, in fact, to almost every thought. That you have, because you don't know. That's why we do the investigation. But be careful, if you come to a conclusion through investigation, you may be wrong. You may be right this time. An example would be looking at mine and say, oh, that thought is wholesome. And then you'll think, oh, that thought is wholesome. The next, it might not be. You need to continue to look. And so having that idea of not sure is an important way of looking at things. It's also an easy way to disagree with somebody. They'll make some sort of lofty statement, and we can come back with, not sure, we don't know. Maybe that will give them the clue that they should reinvestigate to find out that they too are actually not sure. Now, Ivan has recently said that Ajahn Chah had another phrase, and that other phrase, he says, is "no big deal." Is that right, Ivan? You put that out, that Ajahn Chah said, "No big deal." All right, "no big deal" actually fits with Tathagata very closely, in the sense of, as I said, "thisness" or "thisness" or "just this." This is what it is. And that when we see some reality and add some of our past memories to it, will come up with something important, a big deal. And that Ajahn Chah is pointing at that nothing is a big deal. And if we think it's a big deal, that's an opinion that can be investigated so that we can come back to not sure. In fact, this is something that we can make as a kind of a practice is going around labeling things as not sure, no big deal. Because in fact, big deals are where bad feelings come from. If you think something is a big deal and then it breaks, you're going to feel bad. But if you think something's no big deal and it breaks, okay, so what? I can handle that. This makes it kind of easy. And so the noble mindset then is something that we're going to cultivate. And so I give you these tools of no big deal and Tathagata and not sure so that we can cultivate that attitude over and over and over again. That is no big deal. And a quality of no big deal means that I can handle that, I can deal with that, we can win. But if it's a big deal, then probably the deal is bigger than me. Oh, poor me, now I'm a victim of a big deal. But the reality is, is that we made the big up. We made that up. We may make it up like everybody else makes it up, but that doesn't mean everybody's right because they made something up into a big deal. An example would be Donald Trump. Is Donald Trump a big deal? He sure thinks so. How about Putin, Vladimir Putin? Is he a big deal? A lot of newscasters think so. The point is, though, is that these people are just people who are, number one, ordinary, and number two, go around making things a big deal where in fact it's not. An example of that is Greenland. Donald Trump has made Greenland into a big deal. And look how many people are suffering because they go along with him thinking that Greenland is a big deal. Now I ask you personally, has anybody here ever been to Greenland? Is it a big deal for you? If it is, reevaluate, because it's really not a big deal. It's not mine. I've never been to Greenland. I don't intend to go. But that's just an example of 20 million different big deals that people make up. And when you stop making stuff up, it can come back to just reality. No big deal. Now, some people talk about ultimate reality. Let's make sure that we're understanding what we mean by ultimate reality. Because the definition of ultimate reality can change. An example would be, Ajahn Samadhi talks about ultimate reality when he's talking about seeing reality through noble eyes. Ultimately, reality is just reality. But in the ordinary mindset, reality is not just reality, it's a big deal. So ultimate reality is ordinary reality, and ordinary reality is a big deal. Maybe we've got a language problem here. What does ordinary actually mean? In the context that I just used, I'm not sure. Everything is subject to language, subject to change. So it's better not to use words like ultimate because that word ultimate redefines actual reality as some big deal. Ultimate reality, in fact, is not a big deal. That it's a big deal is ordinary reality. Am I making sense here? So if we begin to recognize that these words change depending upon the context, I'll give you this one. People in ordinary life, in the mundane world, every child is told and taught, and sometimes making songs out of it and repeating it over and over again, that this child is special. We grow up thinking that we've been told we're special, we must be special. In other words, this child being told he's special means the child thinks that he's a big deal. And yet, when one comes across the noble Dharma, we recognize that, oh, we've got 7+ billion people who go around thinking that they're special, that they're a big deal. But I'm willing to, and all the nobles around are willing to accept ordinary reality. I'm nothing special. I'm an ordinary person. Well, if the noble is an ordinary person, what about all of those 7 billion people who think themselves special? Who's ordinary here? Again, we have to recognize that we've got two different languages going. We have the ordinary language, and then we have the noble language. And in that regard, this word ordinary actually swaps places with these two languages. So when I'm speaking of noble language, then we recognize that everything is ordinary. It's no big deal. But in the mundane world, everybody wants to be special. They don't want to be ordinary. They're a big deal. Now, that big deal idea, that we're all each one individually special, is a very quick and easy way to go into unhappiness and suffering, that any two people will come by and say, I'm special. No, you're not special. I'm the special. And now we have an argument based upon nothing at all other than— but if you'll think about it, isn't that what every argument is? Every argument is I'm special because I'm right, and you're ordinary because you're wrong. And to be a better way is to say, maybe he's right, maybe he's wrong, I don't care. I don't know and I don't care. And if I don't know and I don't care, I'm the happy one. And everybody else who is special holds arguments, holds positions, they're sure that they're right, and they're the ones who are bound to be unhappy, to be suffering, to not get what they want. So this is where ordinary life comes from, is by accepting that everything is ordinary. And that makes ordinary life— what was the word that Dhammarato used? Ultimate reality. Ultimate reality is ordinary reality, when we say it in noble language. And ultimate reality then is an ordinary word that's looking for some sort of special reality that other people don't see. Everyone's out looking for something special, everyone that is in the mundane world. So one of the main changes then is to start to practice to remember that we're not sure, we don't know, we don't care, because there's no big deal out there. And there's no big deal in here. And that makes life easy, really, really easy. So those two words that Achan Chah was using, no big deal and not sure, is actually code words for the entire teaching of the Buddha. Now that we've got several, the Buddha had one himself. One was Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. The one I like is Don't Worry, Be Happy. Why? Because almost all Dukkha has worry to it. Don't worry, be happy. So we now, we have other ways of talking about the Noble Dharma, and you can sum up the entire Dharma that the Buddha taught, the liberating Noble Dharma, can be summed up into those two little words: not sure. And we can also bring it into the whole teaching of the Buddha. The Noble Dharma is in that phrase: no big deal, nothing special. Everything is ordinary, including all of those ordinary people. Now there are some monks and teachers and Dharma expounders who talk about that the noble mind can be pure, can be unobstructed, can see clearly, and because he can see clearly, he's better than the ordinary world. Or we can also look at it in the sense that if I perceive, if I think of something, if I have a thought, I made that shit up, especially if I'm making shit up about ordinary people, the mundane life. The reality is that the ordinary life is not better or less or equal It's just different, not comparison. And so don't compare yourself with ordinary people. Don't compare yourself with noble people. The comparison is looking for who's the big deal. So we begin to not compare. We begin to leave things the way that they actually are. And in that regard, those teachers who talk about that the noble is better than the ordinary world, that's a distinction that needs not be made, that in fact you could go so far as to say that the world is terrible, the world is a toilet, the world is bad, it's got all kinds of lies and stories and graft and greed and a lot of unhappy, suffering people. Therefore, we should stay away from that. But isn't that just another unwholesome thought, that the world is bad? That's just another unwholesome thought. The reality is, is that you're not sure. You can find all kinds of different levels of people out there in the world. So it's better not to judge. It's better to have that idea of, I don't know, no big deal, not sure, not mine. I'll introduce another one to you: NMB. NMB means not my business. Not my business actually is exactly the same thing that Ajahn Chah would say when he'd say no big deal. If we make it our business, that means that we've made a big deal out of it. If we don't own things, it's not my business. Isn't that marvelous? If it's not my business, then I can be happy no matter what happens out there, no matter who has what thought. My thought is not my business, no big deal. Not sure. That stays in that noble framework. But if we go around saying nobles are better than ordinary people, isn't that a comparison? Isn't that actually an ego trip? In fact, you could go so far as to say when somebody says that noble is better than ordinary people, that statement is an ordinary statement. So when you think that nobles are better than ordinary people, you just had an ordinary thought. That's not a noble thought. But when you have thoughts like, oh, no big deal, I'm not sure, not my business, then they can stay at the level of noble thoughts. And we need to practice these noble thoughts over and over and over again. Why? Because it'll keep us out of a lot of trouble, save us a lot of misery, not creating a bunch of shit. And let those who want to, nobles and otherwise, create all the shit they want, but it's not mine. Ivan, what do you have to say about this? Reminds me again, is it being in the world but not of the world? I think that's the same. Yes, that's a way of saying it, because it's not my world. In fact, it depends upon being in the world but not of the world. If you'll notice, there is a slight difference or a change in the definition of the word world there. Yeah, it's not the same world. The world that we're in and the world that we're of are two different worlds. Or they're the same. I'm not sure. Not my monkeys, not my circus, right? Yeah. Not my monkeys, not my circus. That's exactly right. That's a noble thought. So, Katherine, what do you think? It makes a lot of sense to me. But I still have like opinions, you know. If I see— maybe you're an Anagami. But if I see bigotry and, you know, unpleasantness in the world, I feel like I should gently try to correct that. I do sort of want to stand up against things like bullying and fascism. Should I just not stand up? All right, I've got a story to tell you. This is a story of Uncle Remus. Does anybody know who I'm talking about when I'm mentioning Uncle Remus? Those of you who are not Americans or from the South will not know. All right, Uncle Remus was a set of stories that were taught And that actually Disney made a movie out of it, and the name of the movie was Song of the South, and it became banned. It became racist and banned after it was— shortly after it was made, and it has not been ever shown, hardly ever, in a movie theater. Now the situation is this: Uncle Remus is a Black man, and Uncle Remus taught his own Dhamma. Let us say not his own Dhamma, but he taught the Dhamma, the real noble Dhamma. He taught it in 1840s Southern style, and he told a bunch of stories. And the stories that he taught had three main characters: Br'er Rabbit, Br'er Fox, and Br'er Bear. Now, Br'er Rabbit can be seen as the greedy one. Br'er Fox can be thought of as the angry one. And Br'er Bear can be thought of as the stupid one. Greed, ill will, and ignorance. There's your second noble truth built right into Uncle Remus tales. So the story is, the story that I'm telling you now is about Brer Fox and Brer Bear ran across some extra over-residue tar and they created a tar baby. You can hear the racism right there. They created a black tar baby and set it beside the road. Knowing that Br'er Rabbit would be going down that road. And so Br'er Rabbit, when he passes the Tar Baby, he says, "How's y'all?" And the black Tar Baby didn't say anything. And so greedy as he was, he wanted a response. And so, Br'er Rabbit comes back and says, "I says, how's y'all?" No response. And so, he got kind of angry, and he went up and he started confronting this Tar Baby, and pretty soon, he hit the Tar Baby really hard with his right fist. He just goes right in. Well, guess what? Now his paw is stuck in the Tar Baby. Hear this, Catherine? His fist is stuck in the Tar Baby. So he gets really mad and tries to pull it out, and he pushes on it, and he puts the other fist in, and it goes in deep, and he's got both front paws stuck in the Tar Baby. He then kicks him once and kicks him twice, and now Bro Rabbit is all balled up in this tar baby. The tar baby doesn't even look like a tar baby anymore. It's just a bunch of tar that's all over poor Rabbit. And the rest of the story is, is that they, they're going to eat him. They're going to fry him and boil him and eat him. And he says, oh, you can do anything you want to me, but please don't throw me in that briar patch. This is the story of the briar patch, by the way. And Bear Rabbit— oh, excuse me— Bear Fox and Bear Bear decide that, oh, if Bear Rabbit is so afraid of the briar patch, maybe that's what we'll do to him. And so they picked him up and they threw him into the briar patch. And first thing that happened, he said, was ouch! Oh, oh, this hurts! Oh, poor me! And then he started howling with laughter, you see, because that was his home. The rabbit lives in the briar patch. And so they mistakenly let him go. So the reason that I'm telling this story is not about the, uh, the briar patch, but it's the fact that here you have all of this stuff, Catherine. You've got tar babies all over the place. Don't get stuck into them. It's not— the tar babies of the world are not your business. Does that make sense for you? It just— you remember this tar baby story the next time that you want to go fix somebody or fix something. It does make sense. But there's definitely a part of me that just wants to maybe try and stand up for what I think is right or try to vote in the right way. Then immediately have the noble thought of seeing that part of you getting stuck in the tar baby. Oh, it's dangerous. To go stuck in, get stuck in the tar baby. Because a Brer Fox and Brer Bear are standing by just waiting for you. Your own ignorance, your own stupidity, and your own ill will are there to make you feel bad if you start hitting on that tar baby. This is why I gave you that story, not my business. And here you are saying, yeah, well, what about that? I think it's bad, therefore it's my job to fix it. See, you become ordinary, you become part of the world, you're in the world and of the world when you're trying to fix the world. Have you ever fixed the world before? Have you ever done it? I think I might have fixed a few very small things. Yeah, but did you get stuck in those even small things? I don't think so. Not really. I just, you know, I don't really care, and it's not that deeply affecting. No big deal, huh? Just jump right into that. But I just don't know. There's definitely part of me that wants to try to do a little good here and there. I mean, that's your old habit. Isn't it like, I mean, let's say I see something, somebody killing somebody else, right? An extreme example. And you want to go get killed too. I got you. I'm listening. Well, I mean, I think it's like about whether or not I get entangled in that, because it's not my business to fix somebody else. But still, I can say, oh, well, state my opinion that that might not be right. But if I get entangled in it and say like, okay, now it's my business to fix this person or that person or to make things right, that's where the problem arises. But isn't that something that you have been taught your whole life through ordinary language, through ordinary society, through the mundane world? And it invites you back into the ordinary life, the mundane world. Now I know that there's a phrase that the Christians use often, and that is, what would Jesus do? Well, Jesus did quite a lot of stuff. He wrecked the temple for one thing. But here, let's ask the question, what would Buddha do? Anybody sure they know what Buddha would do? Can I ask? Ivan, what would Buddha do? I want to answer. He would respond to what he sees in the moment. That's what I But maybe he would take a hike. Maybe he would say, "Not my business." I think he's going to walk past them. So the question, Joseph, you have the idea that if you can stop one murder, you can stop them all. Can you stop all of them? No. Can you stop one? How do you— I mean, do you go around with a gun? If somebody's pointing a gun at somebody else, do you have a gun to point back at them? Probably not. Maybe it's a good idea to remind yourself that that situation is not your business. Then in fact, even a better way of looking would be, if you know that that neighborhood has people going around with guns pointing them at other people, maybe that's not the right neighborhood to be in. That the Buddha actually talked about it in this sense. There was a time, uh, there's, there's 4 situations: drought, famine, pestilence, and war. And the Buddha says if there is a war, stay out of it. Not just stay out of the war, but stay out of the territory that the war is in. If you're in a famine, if there is hunger, the best thing to do is to stay out of it. I mean, why would you go around alms round begging for people who don't have any food? It's better to go someplace else and leave those poor people alone. So with those, uh, four items pestilence, war. Pestilence and disease would be the same thing, depends upon how big the bug is. So if there is, let us say, a COVID outbreak, the best thing to do is to stay away from it, to not go there. So if that's the situation, And in fact, let me ask you this: when was the last time you saw somebody holding a gun on somebody else about to murder him? In a movie. Aha! So you made that shit up. Yep. Yeah, all right, caught you. Haha. You made that shit up. That's a what-if. It's not real. The reality is, is that you're comfortable sitting in your house. Why can't you have wholesome thoughts of everything is okay, not a problem in the world, there's no murderers, there's no mafia in the room right now? Why is there one in your head right now? That's the way of looking at it from the noble perspective. And that's, by the way, the same thing with you, Catherine, is that you just came on and made a bunch of shit up. And in fact, in the room right there, there's nothing worth fixing. You're okay right now. That those little things that need to be fixed are still in your mind. Maybe those little things don't want to be fixed, and now you're making a big deal out of it. So this is the distinction between the ordinary world that we all grew up in, and we hold things— let us say about 99% of the thoughts you have are going to be ordinary thoughts until you begin to practice having noble thoughts. And noble thoughts and more noble thoughts and more noble thoughts, and then the world is just ordinary. We don't have to fix it. That all of those murders were thoughts in my head. All of those things that needed to be fixed They're just thoughts in the head. They don't need to be fixed. Let's be happy right now. I mean, this is a perfect opportunity. There you are sitting in your easy chair stroking your cat. Why don't you be happy right now? Why are you thinking about trying to fix stuff? So that's the way of looking, is come back to the noble. Remember, this is the practice that you have an opportunity right now to throw out the unwholesome thoughts about the world. Remember that the real problem with the world is one's own unwholesome thoughts about the world. The world's just fine all by itself. It doesn't need your help. But when you go to intervene, you want to strap on your pistol and wear your cowboy hat, and you stomp out there and you fix the bad men. And you wind up maybe hurting yourself and somebody else. It's better to leave things alone. Amrit, what do you have to say? Can you hear me? My internet is very bad. So I could not get most of the talk. I can hear you. Get the main part, and that is not sure. Not sure. And that's a good practice. Yes. Not sure about those murderers, not sure about those little things that need to be fixed, just not sure. Let's not make a big deal out of it. Let's remember to keep rephrasing those things. Not sure, no big deal, that's just how it is, not my business. And we'll have a happy life if you keep having those kind of thoughts over and over again. But as soon as you say, yeah, but what about, what about this, what about that? You're actually just bringing unwholesome thoughts into your mind, trying to solve problems that actually right now don't exist. So you can stay, Amrit, with that 'I don't know,' 'not my business,' 'not sure,' 'I don't have to fix anything.' Then in fact, Catherine, when she says 'I want to fix just little things,' that's because she's judging those things as bad, and she wants to fix them. And she didn't even ask, hey, do you want to be fixed? I say also not sure translates into keep looking. Keep looking. Keep looking, keep investigating. If you look and come to a conclusion, you need to keep looking. Not sure can also be taken in a lazy way, not sure, and then you go to sleep. But not sure can also be taken as like— Take a rest, exactly. Yes, energize and take a rest and keep looking the next thought. So Mr. Ben, what do you think? Yeah, thanks, Dhammarato. Yeah, can be okay with being okay right now. There's nothing else that needs doing. Don't need to make up stories. Yeah, I knew that I wouldn't be able to catch you. Caught Catherine, but I can't catch you. So, Timo, what do you think? Yes, it's nice to be not sure. It doesn't get boring, and when it's done right, it also doesn't get restless. Enjoying the show, as you might say. Right. Just enjoy the show. We don't have to judge it. We don't have to write a newspaper article being critical of the show. We don't have to close the show down because we don't like it. We could just enjoy the show. So let me see who's next. Oz, yes, what do you have to say? Well, I'm not sure, Dhammarato. No, I like the enjoy the show and I think, you know, I often become a film critic of my own life. And I think film crit— being a film critic sounds like the most miserable profession I can imagine. And yet I've become a film critic. Wasn't there a cartoon character? There was a cartoon character at one time, a whole series of cartoons, and he was a film critic and he was one of the most miserable people. In fact, the films that he was most critical of were the ones that he was making up in his head. Exactly, exactly. And, you know, so I think I don't need to be a film critic. I can just enjoy the film. So, Paul, what do you have to say? I was reflecting on how, like, the word reality or world is quite different when it comes to ordinary language, versus it's a lot more simpler and easygoing when it comes to Dhamma language. But I have to keep remembering that, can keep dropping the stories that were built and keep coming back to these, the reality in the sense of what is just coming through the six sense doors in this moment. And that's much easier to look at and practice on rather than the stories that is usually associated with reality of the world. Thank you for the talk. Precisely so. Yes. Okay. Robert Q, what do you have to say? Thank you, Dhammarato, for the talk and for the suggestion training. Not sure. I am still struggling. I mean, I can understand that you don't think about things you want to fix. I struggle with the current situation. Like right now, something is not okay. And I don't think it's the right way to then just go away and let things happen, let people suffer. I mean, in the present moment, if I'm there, I should help, right? You might. Well, maybe. Maybe you'll make them suffer worse. And for sure, you might. In fact, we're talking about compassion. We had a long talk yesterday about compassion. And that is, is that the best way to handle a situation is for you to not lose your noble mind. Keep your smile on. Invite them out of their misery rather than joining them in their misery. That you're making the point of that they're broken. Yeah, without even checking it out. You didn't go and ask them, oh, do you want me to fix you? Because more than likely they'll say no thank you. Yeah, that's okay. But I mean, an actual situation where, I don't know, somebody is being bullied. I don't know. You make something up that can happen in the real world. You just bystander by accident. And then isn't it the duty to then just, if you have the possibility to just help? Well, maybe what you can do in a situation like that, you gave us enough information. About someone is being bullied and you're a bystander, why don't you go by-stand closely? Yeah, just go stand with the person who's being bullied with a big smile on your face. Yeah, that's enough intervention. But if you want to hear intervention, Pardon? I just wanted to hear that intervention is okay and not anything— No, don't intervene. Not my problem, bye. Don't intervene. Just stand close by. Lend your moral support with a smile. Go stand next to the child that's being bullied, but don't engage the bully. So don't intervene. That's the whole point. Don't intervene because it's not your business. But you can go and silently just stand there. That would change the dynamic completely. That's an intervention. Yeah, if you want to use the word that way, okay. It's okay with me if you've got to do it. I don't walk away. That's the difference. I stay there in the situation. All right. So we have a solution to the bully. By the way, where's the bully and where's the victim? Are they something that you just made up? In this moment, of course. Of course, exactly. So right now there is no bully. Right now there is no intervention. Why do we keep making up problems and stories and say, yeah, but what about this and what about that? There are 3 of you already that's done that today. Yeah, we're just seeking guidance on how to do the right thing. Well, yes, but What about you having the murderer? And what about Catherine having the bully? And what about Joe having the little things? And just swap around. That way, none of it is really any of your business at all. That's the whole point, is that the problem is almost never a real problem. Almost always the problem is a what-if that we just made up, planning for the future. But in fact, when was the last time that you were there with a bully bullying a child? Yeah, no, you're completely right. But it's still, it's always this conceptual thing that comes up, right? What if such a situation happens? How should I behave? The answer to that question— look at the situation that just came up in your mind. Be here now. It's ordinary to plan on the future about, well, what will I do in that particular situation? And guess what? That situation never happened before. It'll probably never happen in the future. So that's the ordinary way, is planning on how to fix something that might be broken in the future. And the noble way is to see those thoughts right here, right now, and says, there's no bullies right now, there's no murderers right now, there's no little things to fix right now. Everything is already okay. Let's enjoy that. Let's get our minds in really nice state. So that we can keep the mind in that nice state in case something does come up that none of the three of you have invented. Something new. And then you can smile and not intervene. So, Aipa, what do you have to say? Welcome, Prenn. The screen keeps moving around. I have to look at her. So, Aipa, are you there? Ipa. Ipa. Oh, they're talking in the text chat. What'd she say? She said, hi, sorry, there's a lot of background noise. Yes. There's a lot of background noise here. Okay. So does she have something to say about the talk? Okay, she's typing here. So it'd be better if I talk here, she says. She's typing now. Okay. She says, I just joined. Yes, I can tell. Okay, she's typing something else now. She says, I don't quite know the topic. That's a good answer. I don't know. Good, good talk. All right. So, oh, Vitamins, good to see you again. What do you have to say? Hi, my life is my own. Pardon? My life is my own. Mikey, what do you say? That's what comes to mind. It sounded like, "My life is my own." Are you sure? I'm not, but it makes me think I'm not responsible for other people's lives. That's for sure. So maybe the only thing that you are responsible for is your happiness. Yes. Your joy. Yes. So let's have some joy. I also have something else came to mind is that at work, I started a new job and I'm being bullied basically because I'm the lowest in position, and what happened is other— I kept to myself, kept a smile, and kept my kindness and didn't get involved, but other people got involved for me, and the matter got better. And now I'm thinking, if they did this for me, If this comes again where I have a higher power position, well, I would want to do that back for someone in a lower position. And I would like to know what you think. Maybe if it worked for you in this case, it'll work next time in whatever imagination that you have about what happens in the future. Keeping the smile and remaining silent. May be workable there too, just like it is right here. Don't worry, be happy. Even if the situation that you haven't invented yet does come up, do you have that smile? Do you have that joy? That's the whole teaching of the Buddha, is get that noble attitude that whatever it is, it's not your problem. The only job you've got is to be happy. What do you think about that? The only job you've got is to be happy. Thank you. Prajna, what do you have to say? Hello, Dhammarato and everyone. Thank you very much. I am enjoying this talk. Reminds on how little control I have and probably none over the outcome. Some interventions. But actually, just wanted to clarify if I understand. So spur of the moment, responding to inner spark that— I don't know how to call it— let's say I'm I'm hungry, so I will eat something, a kind of need in a way, make me intervene. And that would be the factor, if I understand, to— Yes, to do something, to get the body to be comfortable. But the important one is to recognize that most hunger is not in the belly. Most hunger is in the mind. And so when the mind is hungry, let's feed it happy thoughts, joy. Everything is all right right now, not a problem in the world. Everything is okay. Let's keep practicing that. Over and over and over again that almost all hunger is in the mind. Thank you. So, Yanis, you've been in and out. Do you have anything to say? No, thank you, Dhammarato. I just rejoined, so I didn't hear much. So, Krishnay, how many friends do you have on the call now? Well, there's like 3 of us, but 2 are somewhere else. I haven't told them. I don't know. 5? No, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in total. Yeah. Does anyone here have any questions that I can only relay because they can't hear you? About not intervening, for example. Yeah, I had an idea. Basically, because I can see that it would be selfish to intervene if nobody asks you for it. But then what if someone does ask you to intervene? Ah, well, that's a bit different. Nobody said anything about actually asking. Be sure to clarify what it is that they're asking. And always the best response is at least to smile. At least a happy attitude is all that you can offer for some things. So one thing that we can repeat over and over again is, is that intervening is something that ordinary people do in ordinary situations, and they wind up getting themselves muddy because they're trying to help people get mud off, or they're slinging mud. You can't sling mud unless you use it and get yourself muddy. You can't stop a mud fight without getting muddy. The noble doesn't intervene. That's what makes him noble. Don't try to fix things that aren't broken. Does that make sense for you guys? Krishna. Okay, we got one person left. 23 Will. Is that RJ? Hello. Hello. Yeah, great talk. Really enjoyed it. Not sure about a lot of it, but I was just thinking a lot about Thich Nhat Hanh and the Vietnam War and how he did good things there and Also, Ajahn Chah and his community. I just wonder what your thoughts are on those. That's actually a very good example. What did Thich Nhat Hanh do about the American War in Vietnam? They call it the American War. It's only in America they call it the Vietnam War. Did you know that? So what did Thich Nhat Hanh do about the American War? He moved to France. That's what he did. He left. He did exactly what the Buddha recommended. Don't stay in a war zone. So, Sheep, you have something to say? You have a smile for us? I could smile. Well, I feel like there's something missing from your talk with Robert. Yes, we talk about like right now everything is safe, everything is fine. Yeah, I agree on that. It's just that sometimes when like sometimes shit happen, you know, like maybe you in a car and it's about to crash. And stop right now. You're right now, you're not in a car, you're not about to crash. Can you be here now? Yes. You're not in a car right now. You're— here you are. Let's stay in the present moment. And if you're in a car and you're paying attention, maybe you're not about to crash. Maybe you're just in a car. Yeah, so again, I recommend stop making shit up. Well, yeah, yeah, let's stop making shit up. You got no problem. Nobody right now has a problem. No one. Well, I'm not sure about that. But here, I mean, because there's a lot of people out there making up all kinds of problems. All right, so Mikey, what would you do when problem comes? You recognize that you just made that shit up. That's what you do. What, what, what, what, what we do when, when the problem actually come, you know, just— there's no actual problem. You made it up. And when you begin to recognize it, every problem you ever had, you made it up, including you're in a car and the car crashes. Now Are you going to make up a bunch of shit about that? Are you just going to say, "Oh, the car crashed"? Maybe the car crashed and you broke a leg. Now you can say, "Oh, the leg is broken, but I'm okay." Let's not make up problems. Let's live in reality. I think I found a way to let the people around me talk to the stream, if you still have some time. All right, go ahead. Hold on and give me a second. Okay, and is this working? Might not work. No, I don't think it's working. Well, that's all right. That's not a problem. Ivan, stop laughing at me. I'm not your problem. Okay, Krishna, are we finished? Or you have something more? I guess that's it. I'll try to fix the audio next time. It's okay. Not a big deal. Not a big deal. Exactly. Mikey. This is not a big deal. Up to you. You're not my business. This is friends. Welcome to stay on. Dhammarato is going to get out of here in a moment. But yeah, you guys are welcome to stay on if you have any lingering questions or something you'd like to share about the practice. This is a great place to sort of talk about that or listen to others talk about that, share in their own practice. And we invite you to, throughout the week, come into the Hangout channel and make some friends. Every once in a while, someone will come into the Hangout channel here on the Dhamma Friends Discord, and then somebody else will show up. And before you know it, people will be talking about the Noble Dhamma for many hours. And it's really nice to see this sort of thing. So yeah, please stay on. And if you're watching this on YouTube, if you'd like to join us on Discord, check out the link in the video description. So yeah, you can also find these talks on iTunes, Spotify, and other podcasting platforms. And we invite you to check out opensanghafoundation.org.

Okay, yes, I invite you to leave comments if you're watching this video on YouTube. Leave a comment. More than likely, if you were watching this video, you turned it off before it was finished anyway, so you didn't hear what I had to say. Never mind. Not my problem. Ivan, I really enjoy your smile. You too, Kamma. Paul, you got a nice cheery smile. All right, thank you guys very much. I really appreciate it, and I'll leave you now. Thank you, Dhammarato. Take care. Don't leave, stay on the call. Let's, let's talk about, uh, not sure. Let's talk about no big deal. Let's talk about, uh, Uh, don't worry, be happy. Not my business. All right, see y'all. See you. Bye-bye. Thank you. Thank you, Dhammarato. Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato with Sangha friends, centers on the theme **"not sure"** as a core attitude in the practice of the Noble Dhamma. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: "Not Sure"**
*   **Origin:** The phrase comes from the teachings of Thai forest masters like Ajahn Chah and Arahant Po, who would often say "not sure" or "Tathagata" (meaning "thusness," "just like that," or "no big deal") to cut through fixed views.
*   **Purpose:** "Not sure" is a tool to interrupt the habitual mind that creates stories, opinions, and certainty. It represents a shift from **ordinary reality** (mundane, opinionated, full of beliefs) to **noble reality** (supramundane, clear, unattached).

### **Key Distinctions: Ordinary vs. Noble Mindset**
1.  **Ordinary Reality:** Characterized by beliefs, opinions, thinking "I know," making comparisons, and seeing things as "a big deal." This leads to attachment ("this is mine") and suffering.
2.  **Noble Reality:** Characterized by investigation, humility, and seeing things as they are—"not sure," "no big deal," "just this." This leads to peace and ease.

### **Practical Tools & Phrases**
The talk offers several phrases to cultivate the noble mindset:
*   **"Not sure" / "I don't know":** Cuts through perception and story-making. Encourages continuous investigation rather than reaching conclusions.
*   **"No big deal" (Ajahn Chah's phrase):** Reminds us that we often inflate the importance of events, which is the source of distress.
*   **"Not my business" (NMB):** A way to dis-identify and avoid unnecessary entanglement in the problems of the world or others' affairs.
*   **"Don't worry, be happy":** Summarizes the aim of the path—to end suffering (dukkha) by letting go of worry and cultivating contentment in the present.

### **Application to Common Dilemmas**
Dhammarato addresses questions from participants about whether this attitude leads to passivity in the face of injustice (e.g., bullying, fascism). His response emphasizes:
*   Most "problems" we want to fix are **mental projections** ("you made that shit up") about hypothetical or past situations, not present reality.
*   **Intervening often means getting entangled** like "Brer Rabbit and the Tar Baby" (a story shared in the talk)—you become stuck in the very conflict you try to resolve.
*   The **noble approach** is to maintain a happy, peaceful mind *first*. If action is needed, it should come from a place of calm, non-reactive compassion (e.g., offering silent, smiling presence rather than confrontational intervention).
*   The Buddha's advice for extreme situations (war, famine, pestilence) was often to **avoid the troubled area**—preserving one's peace is a priority.

### **Overall Message**
The essence of the practice is to:
*   **Stop making up stories** and projecting problems onto a reality that is, in this moment, fundamentally okay.
*   **Cultivate "noble thoughts"** ("not sure," "no big deal") repeatedly to rewire habitual patterns.
*   **Focus on your own happiness and peace** as the primary responsibility. A peaceful person naturally benefits the world more than an agitated "fixer."
*   **Enjoy the present moment** as it is, rather than being a "film critic" of your own life or the world.

The talk concludes with an encouragement to integrate these phrases into daily practice, to engage with the community (via Discord), and to remember that the ultimate goal is a light, joyful mind free from the burdens of unnecessary certainty and judgment.

### Metaphors and Stories

The talk is rich with metaphors and stories that illustrate its central themes of non-attachment, humility, and seeing reality without ego-driven stories. Here’s a breakdown of the key ones:

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies**

1. **"Not Sure" as a Knife / Cutting Tool**
   *   **Metaphor:** The speaker contrasts two kinds of language from Bhikkhu Buddhadasa: "balloon language" (ordinary, inflating stories) and **"knife language"** (Dhamma language that cuts through illusion).
   *   **Use:** Saying **"not sure"** is presented as an act of using this "knife language" to cut through perceptions, opinions, and the stories we "make up."

2. **Perception as "Making Up a Story" / "Making Shit Up"**
   *   **Metaphor:** The process of perception—combining new sensory input with old memories to create understanding—is repeatedly described as **"making up a story"** or the more colloquial **"making that shit up."**
   *   **Use:** This metaphor demystifies our sense of "knowing," framing it as a constructed narrative rather than absolute truth. It's used to challenge beliefs about rebirth, politics, and personal problems.

3. **"Big Deal" vs. "No Big Deal"**
   *   **Metaphor:** The ordinary mind creates **"big deals"**—attaching importance, specialness, and drama to people, events, and opinions. The noble mind sees **"no big deal"** or **"just this" (Tathagata)**.
   *   **Use:** This is a central metaphor for suffering (creating "big deals" that then cause disappointment) and liberation (seeing things as they are, without added importance). Examples given include Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, and the idea of Greenland as a "big deal."

4. **The World as a Circus / "Not My Monkeys, Not My Circus"**
   *   **Metaphor:** The dramas and problems of the mundane world are likened to a **circus** with its chaotic performers (**monkeys**).
   *   **Use:** The phrase **"not my monkeys, not my circus"** (and its variant **"not my business" - NMB**) is a metaphor for non-intervention and not taking ownership of problems that aren't one's direct responsibility.

5. **Being a "Film Critic" of Your Own Life**
   *   **Metaphor:** The tendency to judge and analyze one's experience is compared to being a **film critic**.
   *   **Use:** This metaphor illustrates the misery of constant judgment. The alternative is to **"enjoy the show"**—to experience life without the added layer of criticism.

### **Key Stories**

1. **The Tar Baby (from Uncle Remus)**
   *   **Story:** Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear create a Tar Baby to trap the greedy Br'er Rabbit. When the Tar Baby doesn't respond to his greetings, Br'er Rabbit gets angry, hits it, and becomes completely stuck. The more he struggles, the more entangled he gets.
   *   **Use:** This is the talk's primary narrative metaphor. It illustrates the danger of **intervention** and **engagement** with the "sticky" problems and conflicts of the world (the "tar babies"). The moral is that trying to "fix" or confront these issues directly leads to entanglement and suffering. The speaker explicitly tells this story to caution against the impulse to "stand up" and fix perceived wrongs.

2. **The Briar Patch (Conclusion of the Tar Baby Story)**
   *   **Story:** After Br'er Rabbit is stuck, he tricks his captors by pleading not to be thrown into the briar patch (his actual home). They throw him in, thinking it's a punishment, and he escapes.
   *   **Use:** While less emphasized, this part of the tale underscores that what seems like a problem or punishment to one person (the briar patch) is actually a natural state or home for another. It subtly supports the theme of non-judgment.

3. **The Buddha's Advice on Fleeing Adverse Conditions**
   *   **Story:** The speaker references the Buddha's advice to monks to avoid four situations: **drought, famine, pestilence, and war.** The instruction is to leave that territory.
   *   **Use:** This story provides authoritative support for the principle of **non-intervention**. It's used to argue that the noble response to large-scale suffering or conflict is not to dive in and try to fix it, but to remove oneself from the chaotic environment, preserving one's own peace of mind.

4. **Anecdote about Workplace Bullying**
   *   **Story:** A participant (Mikey) shares a personal story about being bullied at a new job. They kept a smile, remained kind and uninvolved, and eventually others intervened on their behalf, improving the situation.
   *   **Use:** This real-life story is used as a modern validation of the "Tar Baby" principle. By not engaging with the bully (not hitting the "tar baby"), the person avoided entanglement, and the situation resolved itself organically through others. It's presented as evidence that non-intervention works.

### **Recurring Motifs**
*   **Two Languages/Realities:** The constant contrast between **ordinary/mundane reality** (full of stories, specialness, and big deals) and **noble/supramundane reality** (characterized by "not sure," "no big deal," and simplicity).
*   **"What would Buddha do?"**: Used rhetorically to challenge assumptions about intervention, with the implied answer being closer to "walk away" or "not my business" than heroic action.
*   **"Don't worry, be happy":** Framed as a modern, catchy summation of the Dhamma, directly linking the practice of non-attachment ("not sure," "no big deal") to emotional well-being.

In summary, the talk uses the **"Tar Baby"** as its master story warning against intervention, supported by the **"knife"** metaphor for cutting through illusion, the **"big deal"** metaphor for ego-based suffering, and the **"circus"** metaphor for the world's drama. All aim to guide the listener toward a perspective of humble non-knowing ("not sure") and peaceful disengagement.
