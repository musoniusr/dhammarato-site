### Transcript


**Speaker A:** I just made food. I guess I'll just— I don't know, I was trying to eat off camera, but I mean, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Nobody, nobody cares if you're eating.

**Speaker A:** Okay, cool.

**Speaker B:** Hey, Dog. Hey, Ron.

**Speaker A:** Guys, yes, how's it going?

**Speaker B:** You guys didn't catch it, but Dhammarato isn't gonna be joining because he, uh, he really severely hurt his neck and, uh, he can't sit upright. Right now.

**Speaker C:** Uh, so is he okay?

**Speaker B:** He says that he's done it before and he didn't really know why it is, and he just, he just had to be like really stiff and was like, he said it was worse on Thursday. And that, uh, yeah, he was just here like literally like 2 minutes ago right before you guys joined. And yeah, just wished us, uh, well.

**Speaker A:** So was that the first or second arrow? I guess we can talk about that a little bit. I know there's like— do you know what teaching I'm talking about?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I really like that one. Yeah, do you guys all know that one? No, no idea. Go ahead, you can explain it, Brandon.

**Speaker A:** Oh well, I forget which is which, but basically there's one arrow that's like a mental arrow that we remove with practice. But the physical arrow, or just, you know, what we have to endure by being, you know, physical beings in this life, like, there are things that are going to come along with that, such as our body decaying. And, you know, it's not going to last forever. Um, I think where I was reading about it, and I don't know if this is all like in the sutta or whatever that it comes from, I'm

**Speaker B:** assuming it's in a lot of different suttas.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, one context that I heard it in was basically like someone got shot with an arrow and they're like not wanting to get treated until they understand everything about what's happening, like from the doctor or something. Now this is probably like some like commentary added on, like later by the person who was writing the book that I was reading. But it does kind of go along with practice in the sense that like everybody wants to know, well, what, you know, what's it going to be like when I'm enlightened? Or where— what are all the details now? Rather than like wanting to practice and like try to work to get the arrow out of yourself, you're trying to figure out everything about what it's going to be like to have the arrow out. And it's like, no, just like get the arrow out first and then we can talk about that stuff. Yeah, it's like one perspective of it. But I forget, do you remember, Joe, which is like, which is the first?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm really familiar with— I've heard the story a million times. It's one of my favorites.

**Speaker A:** And what I described in Asuta, have you heard that or was that from— I have heard. I have heard that from the author that I was reading. He might have made that up himself.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I have heard something like similar to that sort of thing. And yeah, I've heard it so many times now that it's kind of hard to differentiate where I've heard what. But basically the one that I really like that relates to my practice the best is like just not taking the second arrow in the first place, you know. So the first arrow of physical pain there's not much that you can do about that. That things are just going to happen to you in the world. There's no stopping it. And hoping there's going to be a day when things stop happening to us is just not reality. That's not what reality is. On the physical level, at least. Yeah, on the physical level. But how we relate to that happening to us, that's what we can change. And when we relate to it in a negative way, and think, oh no, poor me, not me again. That's us shoving a second arrow into the same wound, into ourselves. And to prevent that is just to view like the reality of it and just do the best that we can in the moment. So like when you're having physical pain, I know a lot of practitioners who are like, I can deal with mental pain, but I can't deal with physical pain. And what they really are meaning is that they can't eliminate the physical pain, which is of course true. You know, if you have strong enough physical pain, there's not really that much that you can do about it. But how you relate to that pain, you can definitely change, and you can definitely take the attitude of like, I'm going to take care of myself right now.

**Speaker A:** And in a sense, it will become less physically painful, I would say, from my experience too. Like, it does lessen the pain. And sometimes I've noticed even the ability to directly be with the pain and look at it sometimes lessens it rather than— we're always trying to make it like the background of our awareness, but then it kind of, in my experience, sometimes that like rebounds and it makes it worse. Like you're trying to push it away all the time.

**Speaker D:** I don't know. I think it's just important to sit

**Speaker A:** there and be with the sensations. I'm sorry, what'd you say?

**Speaker D:** I said I think it's important to be equanimous with the pain when it comes up. You know, it's part of the duality of experience. And I feel like a misconception that a lot of people have is, you know, they're doing this to feel good and to not feel that pain. But the truth of the matter is the purpose is to feel it completely.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker D:** And also, I just want to say you guys all have amazing beards.

**Speaker A:** Oh, well, hey man, you're getting started.

**Speaker C:** I'm getting there.

**Speaker B:** I don't think when I was 18, there's no way I could have had a beard like you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you're only 18. I couldn't have grown my beard like that when I was 18.

**Speaker D:** I'm 19.

**Speaker A:** I'm 19. Or 19.

**Speaker D:** I wonder if there's any correlation between the spiritual path and facial hair.

**Speaker A:** Well, I think the Sikhs and maybe the Hindus would have some things to say on that. I don't know how much the Buddhist line of thinking cares or has ideas

**Speaker E:** about it, but with great beard comes great responsibility.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's good. I like that.

**Speaker B:** So one thing, yeah, that about the extra pain thing is that like, yeah, it's definitely that the pain is reduced, but I think I mean, I've talked to so many different practitioners who have this thing in their head where they're just like, they're expecting it to be eliminated, like completely at some point. And like, that's just, that's just like not realistic, you know. I mean, sure, like maybe you can get some really, really positive emotions that can replicate like a painkiller, but like there's still going to be the physical sensations that are there, uh, on some, on some level. And how you're relating to it can change, but I think this kind of

**Speaker A:** forces us into a conversation. Oh, sorry. Do you want to go ahead?

**Speaker C:** No, you're good.

**Speaker A:** We were just— I was going to say this kind of forces us now to think about, or at least if we want to, I mean, the conversation is kind of going here. What's the difference between pain and suffering? I've heard one person give, and I kind of like this definition. Suffering is like physical pain or whatever. It's like the multiplier on top of that. So when you don't have, when you don't have that, those extra lenses of certain identity views and paradigms and everything on top of your experience, which is pretty much inescapable right here and now, when you don't have all those lenses on top of things, That's like what the suffering is, is it's those lenses of kind of perception and our ideas that get baked into our experience that multiply what the pain is. And it's like we can take those away, but we can't take sensations away unless we're in, you know, what some people call Nirodha Samadhi. That's like the only thing I can think of that there would be, you know, a way to get out of the pain completely. I, and I don't know how true this is, but I, I read somewhere that the, the Buddha even said about Nirodha Samadhi, this is the only way that I can get away from basically the physical pains of my body at this really old age. I'm assuming he said it close to the end of his life. I don't know where that quote came from or anything. So, you know, maybe don't take it too seriously, but I did hear that at least one at one point in time. But other than like that state, we're kind of stuck with it. What'd you say?

**Speaker D:** I mean, I think simply—

**Speaker B:** sorry, Nirodha Samadhi.

**Speaker E:** Yeah. What is it?

**Speaker A:** It's basically, it's a type of cessation. I don't know if you've heard of cessation. It's a rough English translation that I've heard for it is the cessation of perception and feeling. I think Samadhi, even as a word, some people have translated as having some relationship to attainments. It usually comes in the way that most people access it, or at least I think the way that it's understood, like for it to be qualified as Nirodha Samadhi. It comes after going through the Jhanas, the first 4 formed Jhanas, and then the formless realms or Jhanas, however you want to call them, you know, boundless space to boundless consciousness to nothingness to neither perception nor non-perception. And then after that, there's the possibility that someone can go from that to, um, Nirodha, Samma, Samadhi. It'll be a type of cessation where there's no experience for the person having it. It's basically just the way you can think of it. Yes, some people call it the 9th Jhana too, um, but a lot of people don't call the Formless Realms Jhanas at all, which is why I was using that name for it in the first place, or else I would just say the 9th Jhana, but a lot of people know it by that way too. And it does come as a pretty— at least from what I've heard, it comes as a pretty natural result of, you know, going through the jhanas in order to the eighth. So that's why probably a lot of people call it a ninth jhana too.

**Speaker B:** There's a lot of sort of like mysticism around it too, and a lot of relations to like— like people saying

**Speaker A:** you can stay in it for 7 days straight. And stuff like that.

**Speaker B:** Like, and that you're just gonna— as

**Speaker A:** a human, you would need water, you would think. But I don't know.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, it kind of reminds me of the reports of what was called like Samadhi, like from people, I don't know, like Sadhguru, Ramana Maharshi, where they reportedly kind of went into a non-responsive, I don't know, blissed-out trance state for days and weeks on end.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's precisely that.

**Speaker D:** It's the same thing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, people mystify it in a very similar way that, you know, I don't know if I've heard people talking about it. I've not heard of anyone these days claiming it to be— no, that it can go on for 7 days at least, like supposedly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there are people for sure. There's this one guy I saw. Yeah, there's this Bhikkhuni I saw on Guru Viking that he was pretty cool, but some of the stuff that he said was a little bit— he was a student of Venerable Vimalaramsi, or Vimalaramsi. Is he an Anagami? No, he was an Indian-American man. I think he was American anyways. But yeah, I can look it up really quick. Yeah, just a lot of sort of like— he actually was studied in Nirodha Samadhi in a medical setting. So in a medical setting, they asked him to— okay, we want you to go into Nirodha Samadhi, and we're going to study all of your vital signs and scan your brain for 8 hours, and then we're going to do it with you sleeping and compare the two. And he discussed— just because they were like wanting to see what are you actually sleeping, you know, from a scientific perspective or whatever. So kind of interesting. It's this guy, it's Siddha Tales, Delson Armstrong is his name.

**Speaker A:** Do you remember what they found with that?

**Speaker B:** There were some slight differences. One thing though was that like he thought that his heart would slow down a lot more than it did because he thought that it would be so faint that it would just almost not register, and that didn't actually happen. So he was a little bit surprised with that. But yeah, he's an interesting guy. He's like 31 years old, and apparently he like studied all this stuff like at a very young age and studied with a lot of different like Hindu teachers in yoga, and then also studied under Vimalarambha— I can't say that guy's name, but yeah, it's definitely kind of interesting to see because it's actually been a scientific study done on the state that he claims, that he says that he was able to do it for like 4 days in a cave somewhere.

**Speaker A:** Which of course that's not verified anyway when we have no way of knowing, but maybe he's telling the truth, maybe he's not.

**Speaker B:** So, but yeah, I don't know. I mean, if it inspired— does it inspire people to practice? This is like the, the main question, you know. Some people are inspired by these things, uh, and depending on their cultural context and stuff, it can be inspiring, I think. Uh, other people, like, if you come from a Western perspective, I mean, it's almost anti-inspiring for some people.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, things sound a bit too crazy. It makes people, uh, get away from it. They're just like, oh, that's BS anyway, let's move on to something real, you know?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So, but Nirodha Samadhi is definitely something that rides that line of, you know, the, like, the lengths of it and stuff. Like, how much, you know, how many of the stories we've heard are, you know, probably mystical oversellings of it versus how much of it is actually someone could actually do? I mean, you, you don't really know very easily. Easiest way to know, I guess, is to get really good and do it yourself.

**Speaker B:** It's just, it's just never really interested me because, uh, it's, it's also like inherently not necessarily, um, not necessarily going to change your life, uh, and yeah, it's, it's just, it's just another sort of thing, you know.

**Speaker A:** I, I heard about it changing someone's life was, um, I, I don't know, maybe it was like Kenneth Folk or someone else, maybe. I don't know if it was him, but like there was a story like his wife would say that he could fall asleep instantly. So like somehow he found a way to like turn this on like right away when he needed to get sleep, and he could sleep like immediately.

**Speaker D:** That's more interesting to me than enlightenment.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but I still think it's interesting though, this relation to physical pain that we have. And I also think that some practitioners overestimate their relation to mental pain also, because it's very easy to theoretically say what it would be like to be faced with various difficult mental situations, but the actual reality of those situations doesn't occur so often. And yeah, I think sometimes people overestimate their ability. Just because we've looked at death a bunch of times, it doesn't necessarily mean when death is staring us down in the face that we're like completely ready for it in that moment. I mean, because we have to remember to look in that moment. If you don't remember anything you've done before that point, because we all forget. What if you just forget for like a couple of minutes or something, you know? Like and you're dead.

**Speaker D:** Like, you know, I think going back to what Brandon was talking about earlier, you know, this ties into the pain versus suffering argument. And I think simply put, it's just a matter of, you know, pain is inevitable and suffering is optional. No matter what you do, you are going to experience pain as a human being, but the suffering comes in when you believe that you shouldn't be experiencing it, or, you know, you start to imagine a time when you weren't, and you tell yourself that you're your present moment could be better. And for the death argument, what you were just talking about, Joe, I think one important thing that needs to be realized about that is there is no such thing as not being ready for it. The only thing you're not ready for is the idea of it that you have in your head. You know, it's something I realized. We don't know what death is. We don't know what it means. How can we be afraid of it? You know, we're only afraid of our conception of what it is, but even that is just a guess. You know, that's something that's helped me get over the physical pain aspect of it. You know, sometimes when you're experiencing a great physical pain or a mental pain, you start to get scared because, you know, you tell yourself, what if I'm gonna die? You know, but one thing I came to realize while experiencing that was, how do I know that this means death? How do I know what this entails, what's going to happen to me because of it. And I was realizing how my thoughts were kind of painting a picture and generating that fear and that suffering, right?

**Speaker B:** Because you only experience the moment before death. You don't actually experience— Exactly that. Yeah, I just kind of was thinking about this because I was kind of deep in a hole the other day. I was digging a dry well and I was like, holy shit, if this like If the sides collapsed on me right now, would I be able to maintain my presence and like know that I'm going to be buried alive?

**Speaker D:** There wouldn't be no you maintaining it. The presence would still be there. You just wouldn't be experiencing it.

**Speaker A:** Can we talk a bit about like, I guess, Dhammarato's idea of death? It seems like he's of a pretty firm, uh, position that like after we die there's— there, there aren't like other rebirths and things like that. At least that was the impression that I got.

**Speaker D:** I think once your brain stops

**Speaker A:** fabricating reality, that's it. That sort of knowledge to any firm degree that isn't really just speculation whether there is life after death or no, no life after death.

**Speaker D:** Because you have to understand, we don't

**Speaker A:** We don't have the data.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, oh, sorry, I was just going to say Dhammarato's perspective, it's based off emptiness and no self, basically saying that there is inherently no individual self. There's no soul, so to speak, you know, there's nothing in you that is specific to you. Your body as a whole is just a part of nature. With that being said, when you die, what happens is your brain stops fabricating reality. And when your brain stops fabricating reality, there stops being an experience for you to witness. And it's just simple as that. You know, once your brain stops fabricating reality, that's it.

**Speaker A:** I mean, yeah, a part of that that I don't get is, so we're just what, like no self, and I forget the other thing you said. What did you say? What was the other main term?

**Speaker B:** Anicca.

**Speaker A:** And emptiness. Okay, so it's just no self and emptiness. But then somehow in some random way, experience forms and you're a being. How in the hell can that not happen again is my question. I understand that there isn't necessarily any, or at least in theory and from my experience, there isn't anything about my being and my experience that is eternal, that's going to continue on. But my question is, how can this happen once but it can't happen again? That doesn't make much sense.

**Speaker D:** All the time, this experience— yeah, but I'm saying right now,

**Speaker A:** how's your brain fabricating reality? Not go into another experience after death. It's just not linked to this body.

**Speaker D:** Well, each experience is its own, you know. You're you're not even the same person that you were yesterday. It just feels like that because you're used to— your brain is used to

**Speaker A:** waking up, seeing— Okay, so that's fine with me, but where's the solidity to the argument that death— that there isn't another experience after physical death for a human being? I just don't get it.

**Speaker C:** Science, that's like— so there's like science, so there's like overwhelming scientific evidence that consciousness is produced by the brain and it's like an emergent property by the brain. It's just in spiritual circles people decide that there's like an afterlife and the consciousness, the brain is in consciousness and stuff. And that's great. That's great philosophy. But the actual science says that the consciousness is produced by the brain. So when the brain stops, consciousness stops.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Well, what I don't get is why couldn't there be another brain and another experience again and then experiences back? Well, we won't say you. We'll just say experience is occurring again.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, there's 4 other brains where experience is occurring right now.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so, so, so what's the solidity to the argument that there isn't experience after death? Well, if all of you guys are having experiences, somehow I tapped into this self-structure thing that's having experience out of emptiness and no self, supposedly. I'm going to emptiness, no self. What does it make me go to emptiness, no self, and then experience another experience again? It doesn't make any sense to me on it in any, like, on any ground. I don't get it. How we can know what happens in

**Speaker D:** order for there to be another experience, there would have to be a separate self, an individual property that can experience that again.

**Speaker A:** So with scientific materialism, we all agree that you, unless you guys are solipsists, which maybe you are, I don't know, unless you're Solipsist. We all agree that there are other beings right now, so why couldn't I just, you know, jump into one of those other being meat suits after I die?

**Speaker D:** Because there is no you.

**Speaker C:** I mean, no, you— if there's no

**Speaker A:** me, then how am I not every single one of us right now experiencing through all of us?

**Speaker B:** That's the whole point. You are.

**Speaker C:** You're just asleep to it.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's more Hindu, honestly. That's more Brahman type of ideas that's not really lined up with Buddhism, but that's just

**Speaker C:** a concept in your mind. But in reality, it's like we're all the same thing. We're all just part of the same consciousness.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so you just have a concept. So am I just a part of your consciousness, even though I'm having my own conscious experience that has nothing to do with your consciousness right now? It's just Force consciousness experiencing itself.

**Speaker B:** I just want to say that I think the Buddha expounds on this really well, and he mentions that specifically what we're struggling with right now of everybody having their different opinions is why he recommends this as not a subject not worthy of debate and not worthy of speculation because— Well, it seems like it is only speculation.

**Speaker A:** I don't really care that much to go in that in-depth that much. I just I just wanted to know if there was any solidity to Dhammarato's stance. And I mean, yeah, I have to be convinced of there being— it's a

**Speaker B:** hindrance to the path. It's a hindrance to speculate.

**Speaker A:** No, no, I get that. It being imponderable, I totally agree with that. But, but I don't get the idea that we're sure that there's nothing after this.

**Speaker B:** Well, I think, I think the idea is based on him being a student of Buddha Dassa and Buddha Dassa seeing the very strong drawbacks of an entire society being stuck on one viewpoint. And so he just decides, let's go

**Speaker A:** to the other viewpoint even though we're not 100% sure.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I, I mean, well, just to

**Speaker A:** counter, just to counter how far they were going. I mean, I mean, I think it

**Speaker B:** might be the most, it might be

**Speaker A:** the most cut out all the magical stuff because it's against practice. That makes sense on a practical level. I can agree with that. But as far as us knowing, I don't know.

**Speaker B:** I don't think that— I just want to say something that I don't think that any— that even Dhammarato, from what I understand, would object to him doing that because he also— I've heard him say like the whole Dalai Lama thing is completely made up in order to have like a more stable, believable society. Like he went through the whole story and was like, don't you think that they just pick some random kid and we're like, hey, we'll train him in the very best way possible from a very young age with the best teachers, and then he's going to lead our society. Isn't that just a smart strategy? So I don't think that he would object to these sort of strategies. And like, if you're going to hold on to the strategy, you never can give up your strategy. You never can say there's no rebirth, but by the way, there might actually be rebirth. Like, you want to stay— give up

**Speaker A:** your strategy whenever you want to. Your ego is just tied to the strategy.

**Speaker B:** And he might, yeah, he might, depending on who he's talking to, he might be talking to some like really scientific Westerner and be like, wow, they're really stuck on their viewpoint, I better like change up here, you know.

**Speaker A:** What do you have to say, Bhikkhu? I see you have your hand raised thing on.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I can really relate to this contemplation of yours. And I can also really relate to this point, coming to this point of like, man, is this actually unanswerable and imponderable?

**Speaker A:** That's where I feel like we just— you don't know.

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Like there's not enough data. You don't— until you're at that moment, I feel like there's not enough data, like until you've passed that threshold, which may not be a threshold to anything, and there's no more. I'm totally fine with that. I mean, that sounds like the minimal amount of suffering there ever could possibly be is no existence whatsoever. Sounds a lot less suffering than any heaven realm I can imagine.

**Speaker E:** And I've come, I've come to the, uh, to the kind of conclusion of what my— what the most probable thing for me is. I mean, remember, try to remember, I know it's not technically possible, but what was there before you were born? What's there every night when you're in deep sleep? It's not something, but it's not technically nothing either. I would say those two states, before one was born, before you saw the light of the world for the first time, and what happens when you're in deep sleep, is as similar as we can even say.

**Speaker A:** And

**Speaker E:** So I have no reason to believe that anything else happens when you close your eyes for the very last time. So if there is something about us which does transcend death, I'd say it's so utterly impersonal that to that it doesn't matter one bit.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it doesn't matter whether it's continuing on because it Yeah, to say it's us doesn't even make sense, right?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, so for this particular life, the result is the same, but I also think it's highly likely that there's another, even if you can even speak in chronological terms here, another experience after this, but it doesn't matter because Whatever happens right now will be completely irrelevant then.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I like that. I like that.

**Speaker E:** That's the most probable thing I came up with so far.

**Speaker A:** What makes this life where we're living too? I like that idea. What even makes that label make sense when you start to really get deep into things? Or what about the dream character's brain? Does that not contain our whole experience within it as much as our whole experience contains the dream character's whole reality? I don't know. Let's get back on to practice-based stuff. I had enough fun. I think, yeah, no, I think off-road for a while.

**Speaker B:** I think it's interesting. And you just have to look at this as like, is this helping me to see into Dukkha? Or not. And I think, like, I saw something really interesting the other day that sort of shook me up. I was watching a Dhammarato video, and he mentioned sort of an alternative, like, story of the Buddha's life in which he didn't actually leave the palace in the night, leaving his family behind. But there's— he found, I guess, there's some really— this Buddhist scholar that Dhammarato likes that did tons of research and found but the most likely scenario was the Buddha was actually kicked out of his kingdom because of some water disputes, because there was some like drought or moving rivers or something like this, and he got into an argument and was kicked out of the kingdom with his spiritual advisor and a few other people in his entourage. And it was just sort of interesting because it sort of like kicked me out of my reality for a second that really holds on to this like strong view of like, okay, this is how it is, and this is how it is. And also as a Western practitioner who's like, oh, the Buddha left his family and went off into this, so I must be able and allowed to do this. And what Dhammarato said about this is he's like, no, I mean, look at the Buddha's life. His wife and his son both became followers of him later. In reality, he came back to his family admitting that it probably was a bad choice leaving his family behind, because like, why else would you do that? You know, and it just sort of clicked in my mind of like, wow, I mean, there can be so many different teachings for that moment, for whatever it is that we're getting stuck on in our head, whatever we're making permanent and making into a separate self. Like, you have to have this just, yeah, whatever that is in that moment, it was really interesting anyways. But it just sort of related to this because I just think sometimes in my life it's been inspiring to think that there's more than this. It's just like it lifts you up to heaven in a way, right? To just like think, wow, like think of like all the effects of each of my actions and what that thing could have. And then other times it's like I've needed to like be brought back to earth, brought back to reality, brought back to the sixth sense basis of what's actually happening right here and right now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you know, materialism and the ideas like there's nothing after death, like, can be really grounding and help out a lot too. Yeah, you know, but if you're in

**Speaker B:** like— just not hold on to— just not hold on to these views. Like, like, each view is to be like— like, they, they change. And these are like— these are These are like just mundane views that can be changed.

**Speaker D:** Your perspective or your interpretation of it as truth, right?

**Speaker B:** Which is very difficult to do because we are constantly coming up with opinions and coming up with viewpoints, and we can't see the reality that it's changing through time, that even right now they're being shaped, you know.

**Speaker E:** Yeah. I actually way earlier I had a point where we were still at this physical pain versus suffering thing. I had an interesting point which could fit to what Brandon said, more practice-related stuff, which I thought was interesting. I mean, we know kind of that when we put our attention and our presence onto what is going on mentally, it can have a healing effect. So why shouldn't it have one on physical pain as well? Why shouldn't unconditional presence and attention to wherever it's hurting facilitate healing on that level as well? And I could also imagine that the decreasing of physical pain when you're really putting your attention on it simply has to do with when you're really completely focused on it, there is less and less possibility for resistance. So it might be that the resistance itself even amplifies the physical sensation of the pain. And when we drop it, it might decrease. Trees already.

**Speaker A:** This makes me think of the time that I had the most, like, pain ever in my life. I had gotten my foot cut by a lawnmower, but that wasn't the most painful thing. It was like 2 weeks afterwards I went to an appointment and they gave me lidocaine in my foot and I had an allergic reaction. It's an anesthetic. It's like a local anesthetic that gets like injected into the site. And I got that injected into my foot. And then I was wearing this like large boot thing to kind of protect my foot and make it easier to walk, like with the crutches. And I thought that it was loose because I couldn't really feel my foot, but it felt loose. So I told the nurse or whatever to tighten it, and then I went home and I took a nap, and then I woke up and it felt like my foot was like burning while simultaneously being like dipped in acid. And like after like an hour of that happening, I just like let all resistance go and like basically like said like, okay, if I die right here right now, I'm okay with it. And then like within like 30 seconds of really having that thought, like all of the pain in my body just disappeared and turned into this giant blissful experience, like with no medications or anything. So it's like, if that's possible, is there not a way that someone could practice and really master this stuff enough to overcome a lot of the physical pains? I mean, I feel like that's possible, you know. As long as you remember, that's probably pretty hard. That probably takes a lot of mastery.

**Speaker B:** As long as you remember and you trust your body too, because like, obviously if there's intense enough pain, I mean, I've had intense enough pain where I've fainted, and that's obviously a complete relief, you know? Your body is like taking care of itself at that point, and like— You just left.

**Speaker A:** Yeah,

**Speaker B:** no, but Yeah, so if your body faints and like there's just nothing going on at that point, that's obviously like very relieving. And I think if you remember, of course, like these extreme sensations especially can be— there's, I mean, I can remember like a lot of like really such intense pain. I had my appendix removed one time and like broke my arm and a few other things. And that sort of intense pain is— it's almost easier to overcome because there's such a massive adrenaline rush and going on at the same time. I've actually found it more difficult with the like recovering from surgery for like 4 weeks because the mental thing happening after a while it's hard to keep up the sort of attention the whole time. And I mean, at the time I was just a kid, so it's like, I think it'd be different now. But keeping it up for a really long time and remembering, I think is quite, you know, that's all that it is. That's the whole thing, is just remembering to look at it and take a different perspective on it. But yeah, just, I think just this overriding opinion, I don't know, whenever I meet practitioners, that have this sort of, I can get over mental pain, but I can't get over physical pain thing. It's like, maybe we should look at that a little bit differently. The two sides of the same coin. Right, yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Do you ever find that there was something you mentioned, Joe, which was that the very intense physical pain is almost easier to overcome? Than like something minor, like just a cut or a scratch. Do you ever get that with like emotional? I think there's one example that gets posed a lot, which is that, you know, we feel anxious all the time, but we're not running from a tiger. But I would argue that if I was running from a tiger, I wouldn't feel anxious in a very uncomfortable sense. It would be just like a flow state where I'd just be focused

**Speaker A:** on actually surviving.

**Speaker C:** I wouldn't give a shit about anxiety.

**Speaker D:** I definitely wouldn't be running for your life.

**Speaker B:** I think most people get stuck in this sort of like, and this is how most people live their lives, is in a state of mild sort of unsatisfactoriness. It's more like the feeling of the

**Speaker A:** tiger's around the corner than the tiger's right here.

**Speaker D:** The thing is, it's not even our fault. You know, we have happiness. It's, uh, wait here. Actually, I just recently read something about it. So it's basically like, you know, our brain is designed to keep us safe, not happy. You know, happiness is just a human construct and it's an abstract idea with no actual equivalent in human experience. You know, and in fact, state of happiness is actually discouraged because when we're happy, we're less aware of our environment. We kind of let our guard down, you know, and it makes it easier for threats to our survival to take us, you know.

**Speaker A:** What do you mean by there's no like happiness based in human experience? Or I forget how you worded it exactly.

**Speaker D:** Well, I'm just basically saying that like our society has made happiness and positive thinking an idea that can be sustained.

**Speaker A:** Well, so did the Buddha, right?

**Speaker D:** When in reality, like, you know, you're not always going to be happy. That's just how things are. And, you know, it's not a shortcoming that demands repair. The fluctuation— you're not always, you're not

**Speaker B:** always going to have world— you're not always going to have worldly happiness, but you can relate to whatever's happening with a positive mindset.

**Speaker D:** Uh, and it's different between happiness is in fact what makes you human.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but you're right, there's an unrealistic expectation that someday I'm going to have this solid state of happiness caused by my worldly conditions, and I'm going to create conditions for myself that are going to solidify this happiness. And again, it creates this separate self idea, you know, because you're like, I can solidly be happy, you know.

**Speaker D:** And it's just not true.

**Speaker B:** But what's unfortunate is most people are solidly unhappy. They're solidly like going through life Slightly dissatisfied, and they get just enough stimulus to like not really wake up. And there's an interesting story by a Buddhist monk that came from Thailand to the United States for the first time, and he looked at the windows of the stores and the grocery stores filled with stuff, and he actually got quite sad at that moment. He was like, oh my god, nobody's going to wake up and nobody's going to have any motivation to practice because things are so easy. It's too easy to be lost in delusion, that you're going to have like this slight bit of delusion and you're not going to have the stimulus to wake up, you know, because it's easy. Like Robert said, it's very easy to wake up when the tiger's right there. It's a little bit harder to see that sort of unsatisfactoriness sneaking up on you, just slightly going through life. And you just have to catch it though. You just have to see my point

**Speaker D:** with saying all that is the unsatisfactory rises up. It's not when the tiger's there, but it's when the tiger's not there, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker D:** and you're still in that kind of survival mode,

**Speaker B:** but it doesn't have to be there.

**Speaker D:** When the tiger is there, that's what that state of mind was made for. But, you know, we have evolved to the point where we don't usually have things that are threats to our lives other than possibly other humans. So that faculty of our brain is kind of useless to us now.

**Speaker C:** Do you guys ever find that it's more effort to focus on the breath and gladden the mind than it is to just sit and dwell in like a very mild state of anxiety or a mild state of depression?

**Speaker B:** No, that's delusion, like, and its own hindrance that's sneaking up right there, because like I've had that thought before and I've now seen into that thought and seen that that's not true, that it's not actually difficult. It's actually quite a lot easier to go through with a— it's when you're not accepting, like what Ron's saying, that there's going to be some unpleasantness presence, maybe physically or maybe mentally, while at the same time you're gladdening the mind, you know. So like, you can be okay and you can smile and cry at the same time. Like, it's totally possible, you know, that there's just sad— there's just sad moments. And you can look at yourself and say, oh my god, like, imagine seeing like a little kid and him saying, do you think it's okay for me to be like unhappy all the time? And you would, you would, I mean, it almost makes me cry just thinking about it, you know, because I'm like, oh my God, that poor little boy, you know, versus like, hey, like, you don't have, you don't have to do that, you know. Like, yeah, sure, you, you can have like, like things happen in your life, and for a very long time you can have difficult situations, but you can maintain us like a little bit of this sort of positivity through that, you know?

**Speaker C:** I don't know if a kid came

**Speaker D:** up to me and said that, my response would be, I don't know, do you want to be unhappy all the time?

**Speaker B:** That's true. And I think Dhammarato says that all the time to people too, is he's like, you got the choice. Uh, I, I got a lot of— I don't know if it's Dhammarato. A lot of teachers have told me that, where they're like, I sit there whining, whining, cry about my life for like a really long time, and they're like, Okay, do you want to feel bad?

**Speaker D:** People choose not to be happy and they don't even realize it. You know, I feel like, yeah, it's

**Speaker C:** like, well, realize that they are making

**Speaker D:** the conscious decision to whether or not it be absent-mindedly completely changes it.

**Speaker A:** Well, this relates a lot to what Dhammarato says is the first knowledge on the path, which is you can always clean your mind out. Then essentially you can always throw the garbage out and be satisfied. That's what he's saying there.

**Speaker D:** Yeah. Hey Robert, I actually had a question for you. This is completely unrelated to what we were talking about right now, but I remember one of the other video calls we were on, you mentioned that you started reading Seeing That Freeze by Robert Beyer. Have you finished that book, or are you like getting— making your way through it?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I took a little break for a while, for about a week. But yeah, I'm about a third of the way through.

**Speaker D:** I have it right here.

**Speaker C:** Hey, nice, nice. Yeah, it's really good though from what I've read so far. It's really good and it's perfect for Dhammarato's teaching because Dhammarato's Anagami, the mind thing, it's what it's training is like your letting go muscle. That's what I call it. Like it's your ability to just shift attention from something that's really attention-grabbing to something else, to the degree that like the other thing is like completely forgotten, basically. So you're like intentionally forgetting things and leaving things out of mind. And so when you get really strong with that muscle, you can use it for other things. So not just forgetting suffering things, you can use it to forget entire perspectives or paradigms, ways of viewing the world. And then seeing the freeze is all about using that exact same muscle that we're training with Dhammarato's Anapanasati and the gladdening the mind to do insight practices. So it's about like, how do we create like a new perspective that doesn't have a sense of self or that it is liberating in some other sense? And so it's just like a really cool way that it kind of combines the more like— because Dhammarato's thing is quite— it's like a little bit simplistic. Like it doesn't really focus on like what I think Kishon would probably call like the magical side of Buddhism, where we're talking about like changes to your identity and like that kind of stuff, at least not in like a really like radical, profound kind of sense. You guys know what I mean, right? Like the common world, the universe and like all this kind of stuff.

**Speaker A:** But I would disagree.

**Speaker C:** We're seeing the phrase, you can kind of use it more for that.

**Speaker B:** I think that it is a radical change in identity. It just depends on like how you're viewing that radical change in identity because

**Speaker A:** being one satisfied motherfucker all the time

**Speaker B:** is a pretty big change. Yeah, I mean, and also like what you were getting at before, changing like from saying I'm okay, like it's easier to like go through life and be like slightly like depressed or slightly unhappy versus holy shit, I'm going to like seize every moment and seize every like because it's just awesome. Like, I think that's— I think that's the true radical— the radical shift. Um, I love that. I love that that happens. I mean, like, it's just— it's just that, okay, so I mean, he's— he's not playing into our sort of desire for seeing it happen like that, you know? But it's— it's going to happen over a period of time.

**Speaker C:** I think also, just as like a disclaimer, I think a lot of this is due to my own, like, my own experiences with other teachers and then coming to Dhammarato, like a lot of the other teachers that I'd studied under, not as closely as under Dhammarato, they were very big on,

**Speaker D:** I don't know

**Speaker C:** what the word is for it, but it's the— I've been calling it like magical, I guess, because that's what like Dhammarato's people call it. But yeah, like magical shit, like they're really big on it. And then Dhammarato discourages it. So that's what I'm comparing it to. Like, for example, Leo Guerra from Actualized.org was kind of like the first spiritual teacher that I started learning from, and he's like super magical. Like, I don't think he— like, he talks about that stuff all the time. So that's kind of what I'm comparing it to. Like, very much— So it's good to look at in your own experience. I don't mean like it's not magical and it can't produce radical changes and stuff. Yeah, I just mean the way it's worded and the language that he uses to like express the ideas is very complex.

**Speaker A:** It's called super mundane for a reason. Like, he's intentionally like— well, not him, I mean, he didn't create the— yeah,

**Speaker C:** like he speaks in layman's terms with a bit of folly. Like he doesn't— but he talks about

**Speaker A:** it as being this pretty normal thing and doesn't talk about like cities and things like that all the time, you know.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, cities and like becoming the Godhead and like— yeah, but if you watch it, merging consciousness with other beings,

**Speaker B:** or, you know, if you watch his interview with, uh, with Guru Viking talking about magical thinking with Daniel Ingram. Yeah, thank you for filling it.

**Speaker C:** Is that magical thinking talked about?

**Speaker B:** There definitely is a section where he hints at it, and he just doesn't talk about it. He's like, oh yeah, it happens to some people, you know, but it's just not important, you know. And this is just— that's a type

**Speaker C:** of— it's not practically relevant to most people.

**Speaker B:** Like, I mean, that's just how you

**Speaker A:** have to go to any type of Buddhist school. Even in Hindu systems, which are rather magical, say like cities and going after that kind of stuff is just a complete distraction from the true path.

**Speaker C:** Yeah,

**Speaker B:** for the most part, from the ones that I've learned.

**Speaker C:** Bhikkhu Khandana made, which was that he said that cities before you're an Arahant, cities and stuff is a complete distraction and you should leave that till after you're enlightened. Because before you're enlightened, it's just like you could go for the, the like actual, actually being happy with how it is now, or you could go for something that's just another form of fleeting happiness, just like all your worldly pursuits. And it's like you put on the robes for a reason, like why are you now going over some, going after some magical thing when you could actually go for like lasting freedom and stuff? And that was his perspective, which I thought was, uh, quite valuable. What do you guys think? Do you think cities are a distraction?

**Speaker B:** I think a lot of teachers mention it enough that it's probably a thing, and then enough teachers— some magical powers, psychic powers. Yeah, and then enough teachers also recommend not looking at it, especially for lay people.

**Speaker D:** Oh no, that is definitely a distraction. It brings up like the wanting aspect of it. You see, that's what I think the flaw with Leo Gura is. He talks about the results but not the journey. You know, a lot of his videos he's talking about, oh, full enlightenment, Godhead, this, that. Like, you know, he's talking about his—

**Speaker A:** but he's probably not a Srotapanna, but he's talking about full enlightenment. I love him.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I really don't think he's like all the way there anyway. I think he's had some enlightening experiences, and, you know, he mistakes that for something that it's not.

**Speaker A:** And I'm glad you guys have different

**Speaker D:** ways to talk about it too.

**Speaker C:** I'm glad you guys are referencing— people have different ways of— and the language they use and stuff. I'm glad you guys knew what I was talking about. I was just going— I think people,

**Speaker B:** I think people have different ways of explaining the same, the same thing happening. I mean, I've, I've heard some people's like explanation of like the same situation basically in the same experience, and it's just so wildly different based on what their background is and what they're doing. And it's just more about like, like, hey, like, what, what is my, like, my actual experience? What am I taking out of this in reality? What's happening?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I know.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's like, oh, do you want to go ahead?

**Speaker D:** I was just going to say, I know those descriptions and stuff, that they are kind of a distraction, because that was how I first came onto the path as well, you know, reading and listening to what it's like when you're there. And, you know, I was going from not having any idea what I was talking about, you know, maybe taking a couple taps of acid, taking some shrooms, and suddenly hearing about infinity, Godhead, you know, Source Consciousness, emptiness, you are the entire universe, you know, whatever you want to say.

**Speaker A:** And I kind of— well, if the dessert makes you want to eat your

**Speaker C:** meal, then— oh, I completely relate to that, Ron.

**Speaker D:** I made this idea in my head of what I thought, you know, enlightenment was, and then I would kind of get mad seeing as how I would take a psychedelic and I would have these experiences, and then, you know, when I'm sober and I'm meditating, I'm unable to access that again. And that kind of created a loop of desire even for enlightenment.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that's a lot of it was, I feel like, is even without the psychedelic path, um, like I've done something similar, just like restricting enlightenment to be a certain way and then constantly seeing my experience doesn't match my idea of enlightenment. Now I'm like resisting my experience, right? So it's like I'm walking around with a sense of self all the time, resisting having a sense of self, which is completely counter to the actual path. The actual path would say recognize that you have a sense of self, accept that you have a sense of self. Now just do the technique that will actually lead to you transcending it, not just like trying to force my mind to ignore the sense of self and become something else.

**Speaker B:** Like, you've created— you've created a separate self. You've created a separate self that is really into spiritual materialism, and we all have done this, you know.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** And it's like your separate self dislikes like itself, and it wants to look into it. And that's the new story of self, is that, you know, I don't know, Trungpa Rinpoche, I love his book Spiritual Materialism, specifically on this point, that like we all get it, you know, we all do it at various times, you know, and get this new identity that's like, my new identity is to look into the separate self and find that there's no separate self there, uh, and it's gonna work really, really hard at it. But it actually— it doesn't— it doesn't have to be that hard. It doesn't have to be like an arduous, like, looking. It's not like— it's not like going to school and like studying and taking a test and like— and like following it like— like this, you know.

**Speaker C:** Um, I love that.

**Speaker B:** It's about following the simple instructions that like you know, just keep doing it over and over and over again and be satisfied with reality as it is. Because we're all like inherently like not doing that at times. And we have to consciously say to ourselves, I'm okay with my reality as it is. I'm satisfied in the here now, you know, and you just keep coming back and keep coming back and keep coming back. And I noticed even with what you were saying, you were like, Dhammarato's teachings, they're a little bit simplistic. And I've heard this about Thich Nhat Hanh too. It's the same thing. But it's like, I don't know. I mean, yeah, they're not at all.

**Speaker C:** Because when you're not— I'm about to be completely debunked.

**Speaker B:** You know, I mean, like, and you've talked to other practitioners and stuff who've been doing it for a really long time. And like, I don't know, I just know from Plum Village tradition where I'm like, holy crap, I mean, all these guys have been doing is looking at their breath for 20 years and then all of a sudden they're miraculously able to just— yeah, they're clearly giving off a presence that is different than like that, that you can just feel, you know. And you're like, wait a minute, there's no other teaching besides that? Because Thich Nhat Hanh gets this criticism all the time of like, it's just baby meditation, like breath meditation is just, you know, baby stuff.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, well, if you're doing it, that's

**Speaker A:** what I thought for a while. It's gonna be a baby meditation. Yeah, but if you're doing it like from a place— I thought it should

**Speaker C:** be more complicated, right?

**Speaker A:** If you're doing it from a place of development, you're gonna have a lot more to it, you know? Like the breath meditation can be rather complex if you actually do what's in the Anapanasati Sutta like completely and understand all the elements in that, you know? That's gonna— that could be like more advanced than almost any other meditation you're going to find.

**Speaker B:** Right, exactly. Because what our idea of breath meditation is, is that you're just focused on this one single point in your nose. But that's not the instructions, right? Like, the instructions are not like solidifying a new false permanence, but it's to see into impermanence through the breath, you know. And to generally inspect our reality from a place of wholesomeness, from a place of ease and freedom. But you need to feel that freedom and that ease first, because it's a lot easier to inspect reality when you're in a good positive mind state. And it's a lot easier to have a good positive mind state if you're doing it all the time, all day, every day, from the moment you wake up until the moment you go to sleep. Sleep and then start examining reality. You don't have to just start examining reality from a place of like, I'm slightly unhappy. It's not going to work. It's my experience anyways, is that like, I'll sit there all day and just be slightly unhappy. Then all of a sudden you get into some sort of positive mind state and then you start examining impermanence and then you start examining Dukkha. And then you actually see something, you know, you actually have things shift in your brain. What do you have? Your brain becomes rewired.

**Speaker A:** Well, I mean, if you look at it in the sense of like the Five Strengths, like you have those built up enough at those times, or at least more to where when you do go to look at stuff, it's going to be more productive and it's going to work better than if you're just in some like depressed state trying to look at reality. Like, I've tried that, it does not work. Um, well, I actually saw, I think, two different, like, definitions of them, but the gist of what I've seen in most places is faith, energy, mindfulness. Uh, they— a lot of people say concentration. I would say something like the ability Samadhi, like stability, or Samadhi would be a much better way to say that. Or you could say in the place of concentration, like sustained attention, rather than awareness being like concentrated into this one thing. Awareness is everywhere and it's fine and it's picking up on everything, but attention is what is concentrated Or rather than concentrated, what is sustained on the desired object, and you're able to do that. And then wisdom is the fifth.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** But when you're in a good state, like when you're in first Jhana or something, like it's going to be a lot easier to investigate because you're going to have all those strengths like lifted a bit than if you're in like your normal like daily state of consciousness and you're just like a little bit depressed or whatever, or you're having all these negative thoughts and hindrances come up, like it's gonna, yeah, like just waste your time while you're practicing and just not— you're not gonna get as much of a result, in my opinion.

**Speaker B:** Although, yeah, that's been my— that's been my experience.

**Speaker A:** I had a lot of success, you know, doing practices from a place that wasn't like, you know, in first Jhana or like close to it, but— and those have worked too. I mean, it's not that they're— they don't work at all. Yeah, it's just like, I, I definitely know, like, from trying it that way and then trying it Dhammarato's way, I know which one I heavily prefer. And I'd rather do practice while I'm deeply satisfied and loving everything.

**Speaker B:** I feel, I feel like on some level it's kind of like, no matter how much you say it, like, like, it feels like every practitioner has that story, and they're like, most of my, like, insights obviously have not come from being in first jhana, uh, but from years and years of, like, grinding away at, like, something. And then all of a sudden it snaps for you, and you're like, oh my God, I didn't have to do it that way. Like, there's, there's another way that is so much more pleasant, that is so much easier to do. And it's like, okay, what would I have had those experiences I don't really know, you know, like, are you talking

**Speaker C:** about, are you talking about like trying to meditate with like brute force versus trying to meditate with like self-compassion?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, not with brute force, but just being aware of reality. Like, because in Vipassana meditation that's taught by Goenka, he just specifically gives the instructions like, just don't try to change your reality, just like see reality as it is. Right now. And that's kind of what the instructions are. So like, even if I was doing other meditation styles, like, I still was carrying that with me for a really long time. And yeah, like, that was just sort of my default mode of being like, okay, I'm just going to like not try to change my reality right now. And then like, all of a sudden, it just like clicked for me. I mean, this is before I talked to Dhammarato. It was like a while ago where I was like, holy shit, like I can actually adjust, like adjust my breathing. I'm allowed to do that, uh, you know. And that's a big jump because in Vipassana specifically they're like, don't adjust your breathing. A lot of meditation instructors, they're like, don't change your breathing. And Zen, same thing.

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato says that comes from, um, it was a much later change like from the suttas for people to say like you're not supposed to adjust the breath. Because in Anapanasati, it directly says like you start with like your breathing being short, but then like the second step, I believe, is when you are having long breaths. Well, I mean, as long as it's not against practice, which my understanding it's not, and I've had great results actually controlling the breath and being with it in that way. And that's what Dhammarato suggests. When you go immediately to that long breathing part of the sutta and you're doing that, you stay with it and you have more mindfulness of the breath when you're actually doing it. Dhammarato uses the example of like someone playing a game versus someone watching another person play the game and someone walks in the room. Which person is more likely to notice the person walk in the room? Which person is more likely to lose focus of the object. You can say the game is the object in this example. It's the person who's actually actively playing it. And that's what Dhammarato told me about, like, controlling the breath versus not controlling it. And I don't know, I had great results from doing that.

**Speaker B:** Bye, Ron.

**Speaker A:** See you, man.

**Speaker B:** Bye, guys. Thanks for the chat. Yeah, and yeah, me too. You know, I've had also just— and not making an effort. It's not effort because the main thing— yeah, the main thing is if you're feeling like it's a lot of effort or a lot of work, it's not correct practice. It's just not. Like, I can guarantee it that it's It should not feel like effort. It should be like freedom and ease, you know?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, amen. Yeah, what do you say?

**Speaker C:** I feel like effort's like addicting. You think it's addictive effort?

**Speaker B:** It is until you've, until you've done it so much and you've, and you see that it's not the way.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's where I am right now.

**Speaker C:** I'm trying to realize it's not the

**Speaker A:** way because it's so addictive.

**Speaker C:** And I'll like have my coffee, like just now I just woke up and I just drank my coffee and I've got like so much energy like coursing through my body right now just because I've been awake for an hour and I've eaten and I've had a coffee. And like that's the point of the day when like it's like in my habit to just like have like a huge surge of energy because I'd normally be productive at this time or start meditating. And the way I was meditating for 3 years was pretty much just brute force, like mind crushing mind. And like ease and relaxation was— and

**Speaker B:** mind, okay, and so mind is, mind is still crushing mind, but it's crushing it in a way when it sees an unwholesome thought, it's crushing it with a wholesome thought. So what you were doing before is still useful because it's still mind crushing mind. It's just that you're replacing an unwholesome thought with a wholesome thought. That's, it's just a change, you know. So the skills that you developed are still useful. Very useful, you know. And sometimes I think we can be like, oh my God, I was doing the wrong thing for so long. But like, all these skills are like, they're beneficial, they're helpful, and they build on each other.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, it'll help me make faster progress with the next technique, having done the wrong technique, because some parts of it was still right.

**Speaker B:** Dog, yeah, go ahead.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, um, I just wanted to say, I, I also would like to, uh, I wanna, I wanna go in a sec But I wanted to swoop in with something just to share with you guys. Maybe someone can give me some helpful input, which has been happening lately. I've felt myself, or I've observed myself, in a way pretty dysfunctional lately, because Like even simple everyday experience can be pretty challenging and overwhelming. And I'm like, right now, except for like little distances, I'm too scared to get behind the wheel of a car. And even taking a walk can be challenging at times because there's like this kind of shift happening where it's kind of sensations, but due to, I don't know, like investigating experience has become kind of second nature for me. And I've more and more frequently had these experiences of, holy shit, everything is happening within consciousness like a movie. That's already an interpretation, I know, but

**Speaker B:** that's the only way I understand.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I could put it into words. And like, I mean, this whole huge world which I knew so far suddenly becomes radically recontextualized, and everything, it kind of, it's just quite a lot. And so like, even the simplest things, if I'm not somewhere where I feel like completely safe, so to say, can be pretty overwhelming and challenging. And I've made an attempt to not avoid it all the time. I can observe myself going into a lot of avoidance and distraction over this because it's just Yeah, it's just pretty overwhelming and uncomfortable a lot of the time, with a lot of like fear coming up, for example.

**Speaker C:** And yeah, like existential fear.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, man.

**Speaker A:** And I have some things that might help to suggest real quick, but I'll let you finish your line of thinking. I just wanted to say— and it's

**Speaker E:** that I can see what's happening, and I'm not I'm not too happy with it. On the other hand, I feel that some parts of it I cannot control. I've seen when I've exposed myself to those situations, I've seen where the mind quickly jumps in and creates another story, which makes it worse. I've seen those things that I've been able to drop them, even though still it's quite a lot of It requires quite some keen observance to see it and to drop it, to not make it any worse. But nonetheless, it's a pretty challenging thing right now, and I'm just not— I'm a bit lost with it because I'm not sure how much of it I just gotta ride out and how much I could even do at this point. So yeah, maybe some of you have some valuable input.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think Brandon, from talking to you, you probably have the best experience with this sort of area.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I would say, man, well, the first thing is, like, if you're already feeling like you're a little unsure if, like, it's safe to drive at this point, I would say, like, That's probably the biggest thing is like, don't do anything like that that you could accidentally like hurt yourself or someone. Like, be careful with that. I don't want to say like you can't drive because like realistically you probably could and be fine. But yeah, like if you're worried about it already, like I would just say safe side, like don't do that because I literally lost my license in a very similar situation. Like, yeah, yeah, a spontaneous spiritual event happened, and then I— yeah, I don't need to get into it, but, um,

**Speaker C:** it was Nirodha's summer party, right? You had a Nirodha summer party while on the highway and crashed?

**Speaker A:** No, well, on it— no, I mean, I had two events happen while I— it, like, within a week span, like, that were very bad, like, driving situations. Because of spiritual events. But anyway, no, it wasn't. I had a cessation after I crashed my car. It was after, not during. Okay, I was driving, but I had like a series of them, like after I crashed. But that's beyond the point. So I just want to say, yeah, if you're not sure about driving, play it on the safe side until you feel good. And as general advice, like, I know one thing Daniel Ingram talks about in his book. Now, he was saying more like this with Dark Night, like, kind of experiences, like also relevant questions, spiritual depression. It sounds like you might be also on more like the energetic, like, positive side of things, maybe too, a bit. It might— you're not. It's more like— it's more like depression kind of stuff, or what? Like, How is it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it sounded to me like existential crisis. I mean, I'm talking to Dog a little bit. I think it sounds more like existential crisis, reality breaking down, losing meaning, these sorts of things.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, this will be probably pretty good advice for that then. Well, Daniel Ingram says in his book that the best thing to do in things like that is to keep practicing because it's what moves it along, like gets you out of that phase sooner.

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And I would say from my experience too, like it's a very common thing to like be practicing for a while, things are going great, you might even have some really awesome experiences, and then things turn to more of that darker side. And when it gets there, you lose a lot of motivation to practice, and that kind of stagnates things and you end up being stuck there. But if you continue to practice, I mean, there's nothing inherently wrong about these practices that are going to cause problematic things if you're doing them right. So if you're practicing right, it's most likely going to help you move out of this phase a little bit easier and a little bit sooner. Um, but don't like overdo it or like, you know, force yourself into a bunch of like really effortful practice situations. If you just feel too drained to practice, some of them— my favorite things in times like that, I would just lay like a depressed noodle and listen to the Tao Te Ching. And, you know, like sometimes that was really healing and what I needed at the time. But I would say, yeah, as a general rule, like, keep your practice up. If you can, and that should help get you out of that a little bit sooner.

**Speaker E:** I am, I am. It's, it's, it's a bit of a mixture between those things. I've been dealing with what you could call like Dark Night stuff, uh, for, for on and off for, for like almost 3 years or something. Like, um, and it doesn't matter if

**Speaker B:** you've been dealing, if you've been dealing with it for 3 years, then you have to see that there's nothing scary about it, that you've still managed to live, that anything that's scary about it is all self-created.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I realized all of this stuff is temporary. I can almost guarantee you if you continue living for enough time, you will be happy again completely on its own. Like against all of your tries to not be happy again, you will find it again even if you tried against it. It will pass. It's just, yeah, a question of how long it takes, you know.

**Speaker B:** It's a fear, it's a fear though. It's, it's a fear though. And it's a fear that from what I hear of what you're saying and from having been there a little bit is that there's a fear of those emotions that are within ourselves and allowing those emotions to run our lives. And instead of doing the simple things that we know are good and wholesome for ourselves. So sometimes getting down back to basics and treating yourself like a child again and being like, okay, I'm going to have to make a schedule for myself of like when I'm going to eat, because that's like very important. That's one thing that I forget to do and just lose doing in these times is like I don't eat at regular times and just being like, okay, 9 o'clock 12 o'clock, 5 o'clock, every day, it's just going to happen that I eat wholesome food, that I make sure that my body is well fed, going to bed at a regular time. You make a time where you're like 11 o'clock at night, whatever, I'm in bed. If I have to lay there, and that's okay, but I'm not going to have lights and external stimulus because sleep and eating, and then after that fresh air, waking up the first thing in the morning, no matter what, no matter how cold it is, opening up the window and sticking your head outside, you know, and just these very, very simple practices to ground us in our own reality and get us back in the routine.

**Speaker A:** One thing I would throw in for that routine is try your best to like go out for a walk when at least when it's relatively sunny and get some of that time outdoors. Like that can help so much in these types of states.

**Speaker B:** Even if it's not sunny, go outside anyways and then try to— not sunny,

**Speaker A:** uh, well, I mean, I don't know if it's like super like just horrible like downpour of rain, maybe not, but,

**Speaker B:** but it might be, it might be this time of the year for where he's at. So like, yeah, I don't know, I

**Speaker A:** mean, if you're, if you've got like a rain, a good raincoat, yeah, go outside all the time. It once a day for 15 minutes, 30 minutes. At least, like, will probably make a decent difference. And it— I don't know how much of a social guy you are. If you're not like super introverted and that— as long as that doesn't cause a bunch of problems, socializing a bit more or trying to make sure that you do that as much as you normally would can help. Because in these like more depressive type states we get in, we sometimes can tend to like cut ourselves off from our friends and family a bit more than normal, and then that contributes to the problem more and kind of keeps it going.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we're socializing here.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, we are socializing here. One of the things like what you mentioned, the going outside, that's a big dilemma for me because I know that getting some fresh air is good for me. Yet lately, sometimes when I just left the house and took a walk, it was— there's a— it was like a lot, a lot of fear and shit coming up. And I know that fear can't be avoided.

**Speaker B:** It's okay. And like, then you can— then that's where the mind overcoming mind thing comes in, because like, we all get fearful. Like, you're— but you have to know in reality that you're a grown man And like, there's some points in you where you're like, wait a minute, what am I so scared of? Like, you talk yourself into it, you know? And I know it's hard. I mean, I'm saying this as like a coach, but just because that's like, I've been there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, we all get like, I know for a fact, like all, all of the other people in this call, like, get our asses kicked by the same problem at times, or at least have. But like, one thing about the fear coming up, like when you go outside and do something, you know, that's good, that should be good for you. It might be that getting out and moving is starting to process some of that stuff that's in those emotions that are going on. You don't necessarily know that it's, it's a negative thing that those are coming up, you know. But if you end up finding like a bunch of problems that come from it, maybe our advice isn't the for you, but I would suggest that that's probably good advice to go outside.

**Speaker B:** Like, even if— even if problems— even if the problems come up, it's good to embrace the problems and invite them in and hug them and say, you know what, you're safe here. Any sort of childhood shit that's going to come up right now, any sort of recent shit, whatever it is, it's okay. You can't touch me, you know, like, I'm above this. I have a method of dealing with you. I have a new way of looking at the world. That is different from my old way of relating to the world, I'm a grown adult and I can talk to that little inner child within myself and comfort him. And I'm going to do it again and again. And I'm still going to be— I'm going to be 80 years old and still comforting that 8-year-old kid. You know, like, that's just the reality of life. Like, things just come up and we think we're over it. We're like, oh, I've worked on this for so many years. What the hell is wrong with me? But actually, an interesting story that I heard is that like There was a monk who was a monk for like 15 years, and he thought he had like reached a good state, and he thought that there were signs telling him to stop being a monk. And he was like, I just thought everything was great, and I was just permanently in like a really good state. So he disrobes, and he's like, I went into a massive depression for 2 years, and everybody was looking at me like, hey man, what the hell is wrong with you? You've been a monk for 15 years studying yourself, like, how are you depressed? You know, and he was like, and then I had to just get back to basics. And remember, oh shit, I'm grasping on to this like permanent solution of like now it's going to be smooth from here on out. I've worked on myself enough. It never ends, unfortunately. You know, it's an ongoing process all the time and you just don't get bogged down in it. Who cares? You're scared. We're all scared. You know, like what's the big deal? You know, go ahead, Robert.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I have a question for you, Doug. When you're feeling like these moments of like existential fear and stuff, like how big, proportional to the rest of your sensate experience, are your thoughts? Like, do they feel?

**Speaker E:** That's an interesting question. They can be pretty disproportionately big.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, so there's a really good technique that I learned about from Daniel Ingram in a podcast/interview he did with a YouTube channel, a really small channel called Empath Development. And there's a clip of it that Empath Development edited and put up on his channel separate, which is called Thoughts in the Room. And it's a meditation technique where basically The idea is that a lot of this is just off the top of my head from what I can remember. So it might be misleading, but I'll post a link to it so you can see what Daniel Ingram actually says. But the idea is basically that our thoughts are disproportionately big when the default mode network is activated. But we can actually decrease the activation of the default mode network by focusing on the rest of our rooms, right? The rest of the room. So like, we focus on, like, first we'll focus on like the wall in front of us, and then the sides, and then our body, and the chair, and the table, and then we'll expand it all to the ceiling. And so the idea is that you gradually, like, you build up this really panoramic, broad, inclusive awareness. And then whatever like typical thoughts that you would normally think that would be really challenging for you, you'd want to bring those up intentionally, and you'd want to just think those. And you'll find that they're a lot more wispier and less scary than they normally would be, even though it's the same thoughts. And then like by doing that again and again and again, and Daniel Ingram says thousands of times, it will decrease your attachment to those thoughts. And when they come up off the cushion, like when you're driving or when you're taking a walk, you'll be used to seeing them like so many times, wispy little teeny little things that aren't really that big of a deal. That they'll have less impact on you. And that's something that I've been practicing with, and I haven't been seeing amazing results with it so far, I'll be honest. But I like the concepts and the ideas, and it's kind of fun, so I'm sticking with it. And I thought I'd share it.

**Speaker B:** You will see the difference. And the Buddha recommends this within the Anapanasati Sutta. He says, you know, examine your feelings and examine the positive, the negative, the neutral, and examine the, like, the song— I think the Samskara is somewhere in there, uh, the mental formations, you know. And you're allowed to consciously examine these things, you know, like this, this is, this is like the whole, the whole point of it. But make sure that you're in like a positive mindset and have some semblance of stability when you are examining this. So there's, there's no point in like being like, hey, I'm going to purposely make myself feel bad when I'm already feeling bad and examine this thought that's overrunning my life when I'm already like feeling overrun by it. But wait till you have a point of stability and then yeah, you can gently allow those feelings within us. It can be really helpful to just embrace whatever it is. Works for any emotion. Anger is a big one that I've worked with. It's like I will wait until I have some semblance of stability and then bring up something mentally that really pisses me off and see my reaction to it, uh, you know, and then see what— how, how am I feeling with this? Can I maintain that equanimity that I was just feeling a second ago? And then you just practice it over and over and over again, and like, that's, that's it, you know.

**Speaker A:** Um, so yeah, this makes me think of a bit of a— like, I don't know if it's an analogy or metaphor or whatever, but like with that same line of thinking, like rather than being like down in like the river with all these negative thoughts and the problems, like when you get a moment when you're out of it and you could say you're like up on a hill, like a little bit of a vantage point where you're out of those problems, like you can look back down at them without having to get swept into the whole mix of everything.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Also, Joe, I apologize for interrupting you there. When Joe said wait for some stability, I said like create a sense of stability. So I'm sorry I interrupted you there because I know you want to keep speaking. I would say as also like a happy medium between those two is if you feel like you can't create a sense of stability and you would just be waiting for one to naturally arise on its own, I feel like that's kind of a victim mindset. So what I would do is I would set an intention consciously verbalize an intention that you want to create a sense of stability and then forget about it. And then for some strange reason, that when you actually practice this, the sense of stability that you are waiting for will come about faster. And it's also just as effortless as waiting for it anyway, because you just forget about it afterwards. But you verbalize that intention first. So I'd say do that if you can't just like create one now and that creates like more effort and stuff like, like I was saying before, like too much brute force and shit.

**Speaker A:** That sounds like it gives you a bit more of a feeling of control over the situation too, which I think

**Speaker B:** would help a lot.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, exactly.

**Speaker C:** Reduce the victim mindset. You're not just waiting to feel good again. You set an intention and you know that it's going to speed up that process and catalyze it. And it gives you a little bit more sense of ease and comfort. Who knows, maybe that has a lot to do with why it speeds it up. I don't know the actual mechanics of that stuff.

**Speaker B:** Taking an electronics break for a day also can be very helpful. Oh, you know, just like shutting off your phone for like an entire day, uh, if you can like arrange your life in that way. Um, yeah, that's, that's another big tip that I would have because that's the easiest way to run away from these things. And that's the day you go out

**Speaker A:** in nature and, you know, talk to the birds and the trees and hear their advice on the depression.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, for me it's— of course there's some depression about it, but lately it's

**Speaker A:** mostly like this— or whatever it was.

**Speaker E:** And it was yesterday, and that's what I've been doing so far a lot, was when I took a walk and I was just— it wasn't— it was nothing fancy, and I was terrified for a good part of it, and I just I just told myself, keep walking. I converted the energy that the fear was releasing in a way. I just used it to not stop in a way, just keep the body moving.

**Speaker A:** That's when you say, like, you know, thank you brain, like I didn't have to pay for a horror film to get this, like you gave it to me completely free, thank you very much.

**Speaker B:** That's cool. Yes, I just wanted to listen that

**Speaker A:** I don't get to feel normally. Wow, how— what's the texture of this? This feels cool.

**Speaker C:** Oh, that's cool.

**Speaker A:** You can change the way you relate to it, you know, to make it more positive. Think of your own ways. But like, those are just some examples, like how you can, you know, be kind of on top of the things that are going to jump out at you.

**Speaker E:** Yeah. And at the same time, this whole thing is kind of forcing me to learn certain things. Like, the more it closes, seems to close down on you, the more you're forced to look for ways that this doesn't have you in a grip that much anymore.

**Speaker C:** Doug, you probably already have realized this, if not consciously, then certainly intuitively, but I would say focus on low-effort ways in this situation because it's It's very easy for us to say, like for me, I feel embarrassed about it now when I interrupted Joe and said like, oh, don't wait for a sense of stability, create one, create one. Because like actually when I'm in a state of existential panic and terror, good fucking luck using the tech, you know, just guiding the mind like that. Like when you're actually in these situations, it's obviously like, it's very different to talk about it in the Sangha and then actually do it. So I think like really focus on like, for me at least, And I'm just recalling like my own experiences because I was having like some, some quite rough like anxiety last night. It was like keeping up. I couldn't fall asleep, you know, just like I was laying in bed for like hours just because I was so anxious I couldn't fall asleep. And like, I couldn't land the mind in that state. But what I could do was like setting the intentions, right? Anything that's like really low effort takes really low amounts of like discipline or motivation to actually do it, right? Like it's really easy to do low effort and then still has results. I think that's like the best thing to do for these kind of situations, at least in my experience, just because like in the actual moment it's kind of hard to, hard to like just, just do it, right? So, but you can always just do something that's really, really small and then maybe the results will compound over time, or, you know, at least, at least it does something, right? Something low effort, you know? Yeah, like, and that's why I think basic self-care is important too, like, because you can just like, I don't know, light a scented candle, like, that's pretty easy. There's no mind control needed for that. There's no Dhamma in that, but it can still have a good result.

**Speaker B:** The lowest effort for me is becoming aware of the body, awareness of the body, and doing the like hand on the chest breathing, hand on the stomach breathing, like belly breathing, and just watching that go up and down and just comforting your body. Because coming back to the body and solidifying it and taking yourself out of your mind Uh, that's, that's the, that's the best thing to do. And like, for me, what ends up happening, I've done it so much, I almost get it like, like to the point where I'm like, oh my God, do I really have to come back to the body again? But yeah, you like, you gotta just like keep doing it, like, you know.

**Speaker E:** That's my anchor as well, body and breath. Guys, uh, I, I really gotta go right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, um, see you.

**Speaker E:** Thanks for your, thanks for your input. And listening to it, and yeah, I'll see you soon. Have a good one.

**Speaker C:** Thank you, looking forward to hearing an update on your situation. It sounds really interesting. I've had some similar stuff with like spirituality-induced depression, induced anxiety, and just general negativity and stuff, so I'm looking forward to like hearing how that goes for you and discussing in the future.

**Speaker E:** Part of it is because everything is becoming radically recontextualized.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that's cool, man.

**Speaker A:** That's cool.

**Speaker B:** Everything fixes itself.

**Speaker A:** So if you remember one thing, you can handle it. Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Bye. See you.

**Speaker E:** Bye.

**Speaker A:** See you, man.

**Speaker B:** So yeah, I wanted to say that it's step number 7 of Anapanasati that is like you breathe in experiencing these emotions and it comes after experiencing, uh, Piti and experiencing Sukkha. And then it's Citta, Sankhara, Paticcasamvedi. And, uh, so like Citta, Sankhara— so Citta is like mind, uh, and Sankhara is obviously like mental formations. So yeah, within the Anapanasati Sutta, he is encouraging us. And I think I just want to mention this because, Robert, I, I think you should look at it again, the Anapanasati Sutta, and just Well, I mean, I look at it all the time.

**Speaker C:** I've never read it, man. I've just been going off Dhammarato's interpretation the whole time. I haven't read a single original sutta.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, I mean, you have to read it.

**Speaker A:** Bhikkhu Khandana has a good video for it too. Bhikkhu Khandana has a good video that breaks it down too, where he goes through the whole sutta and then he adds some commentary, but you can hear like the sutta itself like in the video. That's where I like have been closest to, to it so far.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, finding somebody who has a commentary can be really helpful for explaining it, but the 16 steps are the most important part.

**Speaker C:** Anagami has a whole book on it. I think that's definitely where I'm gonna start because he's— yeah, Dhammarato's teaching.

**Speaker B:** But just start with reading, just start with reading the 16 steps and starting to get familiar with them, because honestly, I've been reading it for years and I still forget the last 4 steps and exactly what they are all time because generally because you're not there and those ones are the ones that are like the most like, you know, it's the progression and it's the most advanced on there. But it's all about like letting go and because the last four, it's observe impermanence, observe fading away, then observe cessation, and then observe letting go. Yes, those ones. So, and in Pali, it's like Anicca Nupassi, and then Viriya Nupassi, and then Nirodha Nupassi, and then Piti, Patini, Sakadagami Nupassi.

**Speaker A:** What does Nupassi mean?

**Speaker B:** I'm not exactly sure, but it's the pattern that repeats itself throughout that sequence itself. So I'm— it's so— the— I can— we can just read it right now. The last, like, the— you know, I might as well just read the, the 16 steps just because— yeah, let's do it. Please do.

**Speaker E:** Sounds good.

**Speaker C:** Class is in session.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so it's when— okay, and how is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivating to be very fruitful and beneficial? Uh, it's when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut. They sit down cross-legged with their body straight and establish mindfulness right there. Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out. Okay, so that's step 1, aware that you're breathing in, aware that you're breathing out. When breathing in heavy, they know I'm breathing in heavy. When breathing out heavily, they know I'm breathing out heavily. I would replace that with breathing in long and A lot of translations say, uh, like, aware that I'm breathing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, most of them start with, uh, start with like short breath. They breathing in short breath and then long. Or maybe not. That's long. So it starts— it's always second step is long.

**Speaker B:** No. Yes, the first step is awareness of the breath.

**Speaker A:** Well, yeah, I know what the second step you're saying.

**Speaker B:** Second step is breathing in long, breathing in, breathing out. I'll find that Yeah, I'll find, uh, okay. Oh yeah, yeah, no, it is the first step. You're correct. Okay, always mindful, he breathes in. Mindfully breathes out. Okay, so step 1, breathing in long, he discerns I'm breathing in long. Breathing out long, he discerns I'm breathing out long. Okay, that's step 1. Breathing in, number 2, breathing in short, he discerns I'm breathing in short. Breathing out short, he discerns I'm breathing out short. Okay, so you observe those two things. Number 3, he trains himself, I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body. He trains himself, I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body. And that, yeah, that can get a little bit complicated with the translation of what body is, but anyways, we'll just leave it at that for now. He trains himself, I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication. He trains himself, I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication. That's step 4. Step 5, he trains himself, I will breathe in sensitive to— I want to translate this to the Pali word because it's a lot better— Piti. Okay, so it's Piti that is next there.

**Speaker A:** Is it pronounced Piti or is it Piti?

**Speaker C:** Because I don't know.

**Speaker A:** I think the I has the— I don't know what the long— do you know what that is called? Like the long line?

**Speaker B:** I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Vowels.

**Speaker B:** I don't know. So he trains in that.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** He trains himself. I will breathe in sensitive to Piti. He trains himself. I will breathe out sensitive to Piti. Okay, number 6. He trains himself. I will breathe in sensitive to Sukkha. He trains himself. I will breathe out sensitive to Sukkha. Number 7, he trains himself, I will breathe in sensitive to mental formations. Uh, and this was the one that I was saying before, the Citta, Sankhara. Uh, he trains himself, I will breathe out sensitive to mental, uh, formations. Number 8, he trains himself, I will breathe in calming mental formations. He trains himself, I will breathe out calming mental formations. Okay, so that's, that's all on that level. So that's just on the sort of feeling level, but not like emotional feeling, and more the Vedana, like on that level. Okay, and then you get to the mind after that, is the next, like the next four. So you go from the body to then the feeling, Vedana, and then after that you go to the mind. Okay, so then you have, he trains himself, I will breathe in sensitive to the mind, or Citta. It's good to like start training yourself in like Citta here because there's different mind that relates to like consciousness in Buddhism. So this is specifically Citta. He trains himself, I will breathe out sensitive to the mind. He trains himself, I will breathe in satisfying the mind. He trains himself, I will breathe out satisfying the mind. He trains himself, I will breathe in studying the mind. He trains himself, I will breathe out studying the mind. He trains himself, I will breathe in releasing the mind. He trains himself, I will breathe out releasing the mind. And I think that there might be a better translation for that at that point, because yeah, I like this one better. So we'll go through that order again with this translation. They practice breathing in experiencing the mind. They practice breathing out, experiencing the mind. They practice breathing in, gladdening the mind. They practice breathing out, gladdening the mind. They practice breathing in, immersing the mind in Samadhi. They practice breathing out, immersing the mind in Samadhi. Okay, so first you're gladdening the mind, and then you get Samadhi. And Samadhi is gathering all the factors together, all this, the 7 factors of awakening together. That's Samadhi. Uh, they practice— can we go through

**Speaker A:** the 7 factors after this too?

**Speaker B:** Okay. They practice breathing in, observing impermanence. They practice breathing out, freeing the mind. And then it's the last 4, and these are the ones that I always forget. Uh, they practice breathing in, observing impermanence. They practice out, observing impermanence. So Anicca. Uh, they practice breathing in, observing fading away. They practice breathing out, observing fading away. They practice breathing in, observing cessation. They practice breathing out, observing cessation. The final one, and for cessation it's Nirodha. They practice breathing in, observing letting go. They practice breathing out, observing letting go. Mindfulness of breathing, when developed and cultivated in this way, is very fruitful and beneficial. And how is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, like this Satipatthana, which you might have heard? Whenever a mendicant knows that they breathe heavily, breathe long or short, or experiencing the whole body, or stilling the body's motions, at that time they're meditating and they're observing an aspect of the body. And then it goes through the next list and it says at that point they're observing an aspect of feelings, Vedana, you know, so not emotions but feelings, positive, negative, or neutral. Yeah, go ahead.

**Speaker A:** Oh, I was just gonna ask what the definition of mendicant is. I'm not even familiar with that word.

**Speaker B:** Bhikkhavi is the Pali word, so he's like saying Bhikkhus. Like fellow monks. Yeah, yeah, it's a weird translation.

**Speaker A:** Because I've usually heard them say just Bhikkhu.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, and then after that you get the next four, and at that time you're developing that aspect of the mind, and then it's the next four And that one is, yeah, where at that time they're meditating and observing an aspect of Dhamma, you know. And so the last tetrad, or the last four, is Dhamma. And Dhamma in this case has like sort of a different translation because Dhamma is also the word that is used for the 5 skandhas, and it's the 5th skandha. So I believe it is anyways. Let me just check to make sure.

**Speaker A:** But anyways— I don't even know what a skandha is.

**Speaker B:** Well, yeah, you do. It's body, feelings, emotions, mental formations, and consciousness. Okay, so body, physical body, feelings, positive, negative, neutral. Okay, emotions. So any emotion that you have, mental formations, consciousness.

**Speaker A:** Okay, what's the translation for skandhas?

**Speaker B:** Five aggregates.

**Speaker A:** That's what I thought.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's the same.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Also khandhas. I think sometimes it's called khandhas.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I know khandhas. Okay, so it's not actually dhamma. Khandhas, just

**Speaker C:** khandhas.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's not actually the fifth one that is dhamma. It's vijnana. But anyways, it's just to keep in mind that dhamma is not referring to like the overall dhamma, but there's like another use for it in this circumstance. It's very like it's worth looking into, uh, because I'm gonna like butcher it if I try to explain it. But yeah, the fourth one anyways is talking specifically about Dhamma in that particular thing. So you can see, I mean, it's quite deep, you know, because like you're not gonna get past like most of these steps because like we're, we're just, you know, we're doing our best. And, uh, and it's also not— but it is linear, but then in a sense you can a lot of times you're going right back to the beginning and just observing the long breath and stilling the mind. So the Seven Factors of Awakening, we might as well— yeah, we can

**Speaker A:** go

**Speaker B:** over it again just to get it into our minds a little bit here. Mindfulness, Sati, investigation of states or investigation of reality as it is, Dhamma, Vichaya, energy, Viriya, joy, Piti, relaxation, Pasadi or tranquility, concentration, Samadhi, equanimity, Upekkha. And so what's interesting about the Seven Factors of Awakening is it has a lot of the same ones from the Noble Eightfold Path, and they're just repeated again.

**Speaker C:** Like, I missed a few of the first of the factors. Could you just repeat that list really quickly for me?

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Mindfulness, or Sati, investigation of states, or investigation of reality as it is, Dhamma, Vichaya. Okay, and the thing with these is it's more like they do— from what I mean, they happen a little bit more like in order, kind of, you know. It's not like the Noble Eightfold Path where like you're generally, you know, jumping between and they're all dependent on one another. These ones kind of more occur like after one another, okay? Like, in practice, in physical practice, uh, you know, and the only one that's kind of interesting is Samadhi, concentration, the sixth one, which kind of gathers up all the other factors together. And so Samadhi and Upekkha— like, Upekkha technically is the last one, but Samadhi is gathering up all the other factors together, uh, you know. And, and so it's, it's really like a weird translation when they say like one-pointedness or concentration, because it's really better to think of it as gathering up all the factors together. And that's the one-pointedness of it, is that everything is together. So you've got the Sati, you've got the Dhamma Vichaya, the investigation of states, you've got the energy, Viriya, or the determination, the strong determination, the efforts that is there. But not the effort that you're talking about, Robert, a lot of like, this feels like a lot of effort, but like effort directed in a wholesome way.

**Speaker C:** Well, this is something I'll ask after this discussion, after this point, but it's a bit more complicated and nuanced than that. A lot of times I can't tell that I'm exerting strong effort until the effort ends, and then I'm like, wow, that was like, that was actually a pretty awful, miserable state. But while I'm in the state, it feels great. It's a very complicated nuance thing, Emma. I don't even understand it, but

**Speaker B:** continue. And then we have joy, piti. So we'll go again from the start. We got mindfulness, Sati, investigation and states, investigation of the nature of reality, Dhamma, Vichaya, energy, Viriya, joy or rapture, piti, relaxation or tranquility, Pasadi, Concentration, Samadhi, Equanimity, Upekkha. Okay, and when we gather all those factors together, then you can say that's Awakening, you know.

**Speaker A:** Then we get a diploma from our, you know, teacher that we've awakened.

**Speaker B:** I mean, it's honestly like, you know, not to be too much like, hey, you should study this, like school or something. But I mean, it's been helpful for me at times to write down all of these and to write down especially the Noble Eightfold Path and to write down— yeah, like we're doing notes.

**Speaker A:** And yeah, that sounds brilliant, man.

**Speaker C:** I might actually do that. I have a little notepad that I bought that I've been writing some notes in.

**Speaker B:** And it's— if we're gonna remember all kinds of other stuff, it's like, it's pretty wholesome to like memorize the Noble Eightfold Path. Right now I'm working on I'm working on. I have the ambition of like memorizing the dependent origination order.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Paticcasamuppada.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and being able to say it forwards and backwards, just because I think it could be a useful skill to develop, you know. And if we spent— we put so much effort into reading so many books and reading so much shit, but for some reason like We kind of like, we don't want to like study these so much. And it's going to be interesting to look into why.

**Speaker C:** It's like, oh, I finished this book, on to the next one, on to the next one. Oh, there's hundreds of spiritual books in the marketplace. I can't wait, which will I read next? And it's like the actual students like

**Speaker A:** take some notes and like get it sinking in. Like sometimes, like it probably would be helpful to write a lot of these things down.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Like so I can recall them.

**Speaker C:** It's like if you're rereading it from all these different sources, like maybe it'd be helpful to just like actually like spend time with one and like really like understand it. And if you're going to pick one, like pick the suttas.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And just like a few of the basic ones, you know, just start with the basic one. Like, I mean, the Jhana factors is like definitely should try to remember them.

**Speaker C:** I think I've memorized those.

**Speaker B:** It's— yeah, go ahead.

**Speaker C:** All right. Piti, Sukkha, effort for the first Jhana, and then like one-pointedness. Ah, shit.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but it's like, it's like direct— it's like directing the mind.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, Vitakka, Vikhara.

**Speaker C:** That was it, that was it. That was the applied effort and sustained effort. Yeah, there's two of them.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, applied effort Sustained effort, Piti or Piti, however you want to say it. Sukkha, satisfaction, relaxation.

**Speaker C:** Relaxation.

**Speaker A:** And what am I missing?

**Speaker C:** That's it.

**Speaker B:** That's it. Those are the 5 factors.

**Speaker C:** Yeah. The Tathagata applied effort, the Arhat sustained effort.

**Speaker A:** But Dhammarato says I had 5 there. What was I missing?

**Speaker C:** Sukkha satisfaction. I can't remember the Pali word, but like the— yeah, it's like the one point.

**Speaker A:** You list them, Joe, so we can hear.

**Speaker B:** No, yeah, no, there's only 5. There's only 5 that I'm familiar with.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, there is 5. That's 5.

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato told me specifically that there are 6, and relaxation is the 6th that most people don't list. So what are the other ones?

**Speaker B:** Oh, realization.

**Speaker A:** Huh? Relaxation.

**Speaker B:** Oh, relaxation. Is what you said.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yes, that's interesting.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, I mean, yeah, yeah, I've

**Speaker C:** only ever seen it as 5.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's always written.

**Speaker A:** That's what Dhammarato says. You can go watch the video.

**Speaker C:** I mean, that's interesting, man.

**Speaker A:** I was listening to the video again today.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay, so just, just so you guys are, just so you guys are aware, there's an order within dependent origination, uh, within Um, uh, so, so there's, there's like, there's basically, um, let me just, let me find this because I was just reading this the, uh, the other day. Yeah, okay, so it's, it's called, uh, Lokuttara Paticcasamuppada, and it basically has like transcendental, uh, factors that come after the traditional, uh, Paticcasamuppada. And so after that You have Piti that leads to Pasadi, which I'm guessing is what he is including in the factor, which leads to Sukkha. And that's the order. And that leads to Samadhi, concentration, you know. So like, I think what he's like getting at is that Piti leads to tranquility leads to Sukkha. Like these, this is just like the natural progression.

**Speaker A:** Relaxation, however you want to say it, basically.

**Speaker B:** Like, okay, yeah, he was pretty clear.

**Speaker A:** Like, he was saying, like, you can't have any physical pain in your body or anything and it be first Jhana, like, at all, is what he's saying. Um, which was a totally different, like, or it was a new thing to me to hear someone say that about Jhana. And it was actually really helpful. I think, I don't think they know that. And see, you know, am I fully relaxed? And then you learn how to become more and more relaxed. Yeah, when practicing this, this links into

**Speaker C:** what Ron was saying before about the distinction between suffering and pain. I don't think you can have any suffering and it be Jhana, right? Because Jhana is like the elimination of suffering. It's kind of— yeah, but physical pain, like the actual sensation of pain, as long as the actual Dukkha element of the pain has been taken away, which is independent from any physical sensation in the body, I don't know if I'm

**Speaker B:** wrong, but well, number 4, in Jhana number 4, you would eliminate that too. Like, that's when you're still aware because there's still applied and sustained thought, so that there's still an awareness of the body there. In the first Jhana, you're still aware of sensations, but you just see them as sensations, you know?

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And you look into it. Yeah. And so there's nothing associated with it. There's no judging. There's no you've eliminated that step of— yeah, but there's still applied and sustained thought. It's still there. Like, you have to have awareness of your body. Well, you're going to, of course, because Piti is going to be pleasurable, you know. Like, it's just going to be physically pleasurable within your body to some degree or another, you know. But yeah, anyways, like, I think some of the other lists though can be really interesting to look into, like especially the Noble Eight path because there's so many different translations of the Noble Eightfold Path and the different words, and they can be useful to like, to like look at it. Okay, why does one person translate it as right view? Why does one person have right understanding, you know? And that can be really helpful in your practice. I, in my practice, I found it to be very helpful to examine what does it change.

**Speaker A:** Sorry, do you want to go over go over like the Noble Eightfold Path and maybe like your understanding of each of the terms and sort of the different translations you've come across? Because I'm kind of lost like in what, which to go with, like what right view means, what right effort means.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so I have the effort, I

**Speaker A:** understand more, but like right view, really, I don't know what the hell it means anymore because I've seen so much, you know.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so right effort also can be translated as right action. You know, that can be another translation that I've heard for that one.

**Speaker A:** That helps.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and it's just trying it out. So the best advice I got from this was reading a book by— Wait,

**Speaker A:** this is effort, not view, right? That we're talking about right now. Yeah, but view is what I'm confused about mostly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right understanding. Changed that for me is being like, okay, it's not something that I'm choosing. Like, that's— this is just reality as it is. You finally understood reality as it is with wisdom, you know, and you finally have gained some wisdom into this. And wisdom— what's the Pali word for wisdom?

**Speaker A:** Pañña, I think.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, and so when you finally have gotten that, uh, like, because I, I think there— because there's generally an order of like getting to that, getting to wisdom. And this is why the Noble Eightfold Path is so interesting, because they're all so flexible and related on each other. Are you going to wait until your Sila is perfect and those three factors of the Noble Eightfold Path to get started? No, of course not. Like, you know, you'll be waiting for infinity if you try to get your Sila perfect before trying to get any wisdom or any insight into reality.

**Speaker A:** But the main thing helps with Sila a lot, honestly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Oh, it's the biggest— I think this

**Speaker C:** should be the other way around. The wisdom should come first because the Sila comes automatically when you're wise.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay. But then, yeah, but then you have

**Speaker C:** to— you don't even have to think about it.

**Speaker B:** These are universal teachings for people, and some people might be like, you know,

**Speaker C:** uh, yeah, they're already too dumb to like— not even— you don't necessarily need

**Speaker A:** like You know, I mean, like, Tara is wise, right?

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** As like the first thing that you teach them, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, you teach them that it's all sensations and that there's, you know, no self that lives or, you know, dies between, you know, moments or whatever, you know.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, you say, you say, okay, put down the needle first. Right, right, put down the heroin.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and this is why, like, you go to, like, a meditation retreat or to a monastery and they have some regulations where they're like, hey, you know, try to not do this and this and this, uh, while you're here. This is, this is sort of the, the raw thing. So, right, yeah, right view is just, just remembering that it's like, it's within the, like, wisdom section of the Noble Eightfold Path. And so right understanding— what is wisdom? Well, you tell me. You've gotten some wisdom, you know.

**Speaker A:** I don't even know what, what it is. I probably have it, but I don't know exactly what it is anymore.

**Speaker C:** Like insights, you know, like insights.

**Speaker B:** It's like wisdom is knowing to say that I don't know what it is anymore. That is wisdom.

**Speaker A:** Well, I'm doing great. No, it is. It's

**Speaker C:** like when you realize something, it's like when you see something very clearly that it's true. So you see something the way that it really is.

**Speaker A:** Yes, right.

**Speaker C:** So you thought it was some way before, and now you— it's been recontextualized because you have like all the evidence and you— or more evidence.

**Speaker A:** And you see, what if you're just— oh wow, this is actually wrong again, is my question. Sorry.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you have to have the humility. You have to have the humility to be able to see that. But I think at a certain certain points you become so confident about certain truths because you've seen it so many times. And for some people it happens— that's wisdom— it happens like a lightning bolt. Like there's a lightning bolt, like this

**Speaker C:** jealousy, that— yeah, it's like that moment, that Arahant feeling.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, it's like harmful to me and I'm going to stop being jealous. For most people though, it's a gradual process. It's like, I kind of see that this jealousy thing is like really not a good thing. I should try and do it a little bit less, and a little bit less, and a little bit less. And then eventually you get to the point where you're like, okay, well, like, that's clearly harmful, you know. Like, it's so clear that, like, I don't care if you argue with me about it. Like, I don't care when I'm in situations with people. You just smile in that situation. You're like, okay, well, you know, I can sit here and listen to you, but I, I know you're wrong because like, that's, that's just, this is just reality. Like, it's not a know-it-all at that point. It's like, it's so confident from like examining over and over and over again certain aspects of reality, uh, and specifically like the hindrance. The hindrances are just harmful. And there are people who would argue, there are people who would argue that they're not harmful. Like, you literally, you might give me a philosophical argument with to somebody and be like, it's— I mean, there's, there's

**Speaker C:** nothing wrong with that. We did that in the last US Sangha last night. Um, I was asking people like, is it beneficial to introduce some level of suffering to motivate myself to sit down and meditate? Because I really don't want to and it hurts to do it, right? It's like, oh, it's like, oh, it's like that dull depression that when you first sit down because you wanted to like watch TV or something. And I was like, is it still good to meditate or should I just feel good? And they were like Well, you've got to find your way around that. Like, you've got to feel good while you're still taking right action. That's the whole challenge of it. That's why it's difficult. And I was like, that's even more effort.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I know what you're getting at, Brandon, is that like it is easy to like then take this to things we haven't actually had insight about, just things that we've just read or that we have not actually experienced for ourselves. I'm still struggling with a lot of things that I, from hearing other people say that it's unskillful, it's probably unskillful, but I still fall into those habit patterns. But there's certain things that I'm like, wow, that is just so clear. Like, yeah, but I know I do that a lot. I don't want to get cocky about it and like not be open to like change and other people's perspective, but Also, like, just being confident that you have had real wisdom experiences and the wisdom to be able to say, I really don't know.

**Speaker A:** That's kind of the state I found myself in when I was asking about the experience after death thing. Like, I realized, like, I was asking the question, like, can you guys, like, please give me, like, some good like different perspectives to look at this, and then I'm like sitting there thinking I've already looked at all these things,

**Speaker B:** you

**Speaker A:** know, like, but it's that, that's just like an imponderable in my opinion. Yeah, like that's what it is.

**Speaker B:** It is an imponderable. Yeah. Um, the other, I just, the other factors of like the Noble Eightfold Path though, um, we can just, we can go over it really quickly, uh And,

**Speaker A:** uh, Samadhi, right, right effort. And then where are we at with like the third?

**Speaker B:** Uh, it's also translated— it's also translated as like right intention. Uh, right, yeah, yeah, but The next one, the next one is always like, uh, is right, right intention. Uh, sometimes they, they translate it as, uh, they say right aspiration, right motivation. Okay, okay. Um, yeah, and says, it says here a little thing from the suttas. It says, and what is right, uh, right intention? Uh, the intention to renunciation, the intention of freedom from ill will, and harmlessness. Okay, so you're intending at this point to be free from ill will, to have harmlessness. Okay, and it's useful to say like right view comes first. Like that sticks with me from like there's a sutta that is like really a common one that is read all the time, and the Buddha says over and over again in that one, right view comes first, right understanding comes and seeing that our actions have consequences. This is it. This is the right understanding, you know. Yeah, after that we've got right speech, which is pretty straightforward. You know, this gets into the Sila aspect of it.

**Speaker A:** Sometimes it's not. Some of the stuff Bhikkhuni gets pretty hardcore about. Core on it.

**Speaker B:** But yeah, I mean, the translation is pretty easy to understand though. It obviously includes internal speech too, you know, it's not just external speech, so speaking to ourselves internally. Right action, and yeah, and this is just like physically manifesting, like doing the right thing here. Right livelihood, Again, this one can get— I think Westerners get way too focused on this way too often. And I say this as somebody who got way too focused on it. And the Buddha doesn't like lay out these big like existential sort of like— which one is that? Right livelihood.

**Speaker A:** We get stuck.

**Speaker B:** I think Westerners get stuck on this a lot because they sit and think about it and then they relate it to their life and they're like, but what is my consequence of this action and this action and this action? Oh, it all leads to global warming, which leads to, uh, people being harmed, or this is— this leads to a factory in China where people are being harmed, and it's way too deep, you know. It's like you don't need to look at it.

**Speaker A:** Human beings are death machines. It's just kind of how it is, you know. Yeah, you're always going to end up destroying something just for being here. So wait, so you can only do that to a certain extent, you know, like, so what happens when you try to perfect that?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so what happens with compassion though is you hear the word compassion and you're like, well, wait a minute, like, this clothing was produced in some factory in like, you know, with not good conditions. Like, I don't want to support that, you know?

**Speaker A:** And then you stop supporting it and that person doesn't have a job and they make half the living they made before, maybe, who knows?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** It goes on forever.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so you can't look into it in that way. You just need to try to reduce harm as much as you can. You know, and like not have these big like sort of rules and a new set of like Ten Commandments for ourselves. It's not about what right livelihood is about, you know.

**Speaker C:** I think you hit the nail on the head, man. The middle way, do what you can to get the rest.

**Speaker B:** And then we have right effort, and right effort is like the, you know, the really big one also that Westerners, uh, are really not getting a lot, um, you know. And I know this is somebody who just— I just didn't get it Specifically

**Speaker A:** because— thing you could tell like me, like to try to like help with the— like get the understanding you did, like with right effort. Like if you could just sum it up.

**Speaker B:** If I could sum it up, uh,

**Speaker A:** like— or you can talk about it as long as you want, I got all night.

**Speaker B:** Um, replace— so replacing a state that you're in that is a hindrance on the path and finding some other way. So like, yeah, I mean, the Buddha lays it out so well of saying like there's 4 different things that you can do, or maybe it's 5, I can't remember, of how to get out of a, like, this sort of unwholesome state, this hindrance state and just not realizing that it's possible. For a while I thought the world is depressive and I want to face reality as it is. And like, it just was wrong. It just was wrong view.

**Speaker A:** That was just a complete lens of, you know, BS you're throwing on top of reality, that it's impressive. Like, it doesn't have to be, but you can be depressed and then that's a valid experience. Right, because you're holding that view.

**Speaker B:** And so my wrong, my wrong, my wrong effort is allowing, is allowing myself to stay in that state and not changing it and not realizing that I

**Speaker A:** have to basically moving toward less suffering in a sense too, and more wholesome activities, thinking, whatever. Yeah, yeah, sweet, sweet, makes sense.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Uh, this is from the Suttas, he says, and what is right effort? Here the monk arouses his will, puts forth effort, generates energy, uses his mind, and strives to prevent the arising of evil and unwholesome mental states that have not yet arisen. Yeah, that's— this is the other important part, is that seeing that what to do when a state has not yet— so when we have— there's four different possibilities. So we're in a negative mind state and we know that we're in a negative mind state. We're in a negative mind state and we don't know that we're in a negative mind state. We're in a positive mind state and we're not aware of that, or positive and positive, you know. And the Buddha does this often because it's like an easy way of remembering things. But basically he gives you tips for like, how is it that when an unwholesome state has arisen, what do we do with it? Or what do we do with states of mind when they haven't arisen yet? Well, obviously that's pretty easy. Just keep going with what you're doing, you know. If an unwholesome state hasn't arisen, then just keep generating the wholesome, you know. Okay, so he says he arouses his will and strives to eliminate evil and unwholesome mental states that have already arisen. He arouses his will and strives to generate wholesome mental states that have not yet arisen.

**Speaker C:** Do you think that was a mistranslation, the word strive? You think that was someone like picked just a bad word for that and now it's just spread because like some idiot just like that?

**Speaker B:** Right, yeah, it wouldn't be striving because you're actually doing it.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, strive sounds like try.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you don't try, you just do it.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, exactly,

**Speaker B:** that is not strive. And this is how you have to read the suttas is with an ear for this. Especially like if you read Bhikkhu Bodhi's translations, like he's the one that has done a lot. I find his translations very misleading very often. And just from my personal practice, he's obviously like an awesome guy, 'cause he's like, I don't wanna like disparage the guy for doing like massive amount of translation work. He's translated everything. But like at the same time, I find some other translations more useful often or comparing them from different traditions can be useful, or just using your common sense and being like, wait, that doesn't make sense, you know? Like, yeah, yeah. And then it arouses his common sense.

**Speaker C:** It's huge on the path, man. That's, that's understated. It's the importance of just actually— like, people reject— I feel like, because this is something that I did for years, was like rejecting our intellect, rejecting common sense. It's like, oh, that's just monkey mind. And it's like, no, dude, like, actually, like, think about this, think it through.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Like that would really use that term that much. Or at least he would say he would have a lot of— he would have other terms for intellect in a positive way. I mean, in Hinduism, there are, you know, frames that talk about mind in a rather positive way, you know, opposed to just like— it seems like a really New Age spiritual thing to get all attached on this idea of monkey mind and like hate the intellect. Hate thoughts, and it's like, okay, we just hate— we just, you know, pushed away and created aversion to, you know, our sixth sense door forever. That's gonna work, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And a common one that people get hung up with when they first hear about the next factor on the path, which is like right mindfulness or right Sati, is I've heard all the time from people, they're like, okay, so I'm not supposed to think about the future, I'm not supposed to think about the past, how do plan? How do I like get anything done? I'm only here in the present, so like I just have to be aware of like what I'm doing. And like then they get in their

**Speaker A:** mind, the past are in the present, so right, exactly.

**Speaker B:** But it's definitely, it's definitely a leap for a lot of people.

**Speaker C:** That's exactly what I was talking about. I actually completely forgot what I was talking about.

**Speaker B:** What did you just say?

**Speaker C:** I had a really good point.

**Speaker B:** I was talking about Samatha.

**Speaker C:** Oh yeah, the future and the past. The future and the past. Like, that's exactly what I was talking about with like resisting my own sense of self and creating even more resistance through spiritual ideas. It's like you're creating even more resistance. Like, when you're thinking, don't think of the present, don't think of the future, don't think of the past, it's like, it's like all this tension.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And it's some— it's Samma Sati, it's right mindfulness. It's not just raw mindfulness, you know. This is a thing, right mindfulness, Samma Sati, you know. This is the factor on the path.

**Speaker A:** Would that just be mindfulness directed toward wholesome objects is a way to say that, or like, how would you break that down?

**Speaker B:** Uh, wrong mindfulness— it's easiest to use an analogy. Wrong mindfulness is being in war and very focused on your gun that you're aiming at somebody, and you're very mindful of your, like, pulling the trigger and killing somebody. That's wrong mindfulness. You know, like, so the— where the focus of the mindfulness lies.

**Speaker A:** Just because it's unwholesome, right?

**Speaker B:** Right, exactly. Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Okay, cool.

**Speaker A:** And then we have what? Samadhi and then wisdom.

**Speaker B:** And then Samadhi. Yeah, and that's— and that's not— that's it. And then you have

**Speaker A:** Samma Sanghappa. It's what leads to wisdom, right? The Noble Eightfold Path. So wisdom isn't on the Or is

**Speaker B:** it part of— No, wisdom is— there's like 3 categories of like the— within the practice. So like the wisdom is like within— it's like the 2 different factors within that, you know. And so it's the first 2, I believe. It's right view and right intention, or right aspiration, right motivation. Those first 2 are sort of like the— like wisdom section, if you will, of the Noble Eightfold Path. The next three are the Sila section. So then you get the right speech, the right action, right livelihood. And then the last two are kind of like the practice itself, you know. And that's the right effort and— sorry, the last three. So it's the right effort, the right mindfulness, and the right concentration. You know, those are like the things that you're doing, the super mundane, if you will, of the thing, you know. I wish I had my other book with me just to verify, but I've read it so many times, I'm pretty confident that that's how it is. Yeah, but I think, but just to stick to something I am really confident about, to stick to the right mindfulness thing, It's just to have all the other factors together with us. And it's the same with Samadhi. It's Samma Samadhi, you know. And so it's like there can be a wrong Samadhi. Like that is possible. And the Buddha puts out what is like wrong. And like he says in one of the suttas, he says each of these, what is right and what is wrong. I think it's the Great Forty or something like that is the one that best says it, is the sutta that goes over the Noble Eightfold Path the best. Definitely another one to check out. And what is that?

**Speaker A:** Which—

**Speaker B:** what number is it?

**Speaker A:** Well, yeah, which— no, yeah, what number?

**Speaker B:** 117.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so Anagami and Nikaya, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that one's— yeah, I think that's one of them that Dhammarato was telling me to do, like 117, 118, and 119 were like the best places to like start.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but starting with 119 first and then reading— that's what he said.

**Speaker A:** He said 119, 118, and then 117.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** And I don't think I've looked at 117 yet, but yeah, look at it, it's awesome. 119 and 118. Yeah, 117 is on Anapanasati, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And what's 119 called?

**Speaker B:** Mindfulness of the Body.

**Speaker A:** Mindfulness of the Body. Yeah, that was where it was talking about like your body's gonna be decayed in like some like grave, like all the parts

**Speaker B:** It makes sense, right? Because you're like, if you're not aware of your physical body, if you're just like completely just in the air, like you've got to become like grounded and aware of your body. It always starts there. Every meditation for me, that's step one, is like awareness of the body, you know? Like that's traditionally how it's taught in like almost every Thai forest teaching I've had. When they do a guided meditation, they're always like awareness to the body for at least the first like 5 minutes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, even in Heartfulness, we always started with a relaxation that basically went through like a bunch of different like small body parts. Like basically it would go through the whole body, like, you know, relax this part of the body, relax this part of the body, and you'd go through the whole body. And by the time you go to actually meditate, you're already in that rather relaxed state.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's just useful in everyday life of what we were getting at with Dog too, that like when things get overwhelming, like that's the place to focus is the body, you know. And to see our mind jump to the Anagami, like what I've— just because it's so present in my mind, what I've recently noticed is whenever I get overwhelmed by emotions and then I go to my body, it immediately goes to the negative sensations, and it doesn't notice that there's also a lot of sort of neutral and positive sensations within my body at the same time. And it's like, wow, that's kind of interesting that like I feel like anger and like I immediately will feel it. The attention goes to my throat. What about my feet? Like, I'm like, I obviously have some—

**Speaker A:** I would say genetically and socially, psychologically, whatever, we're set up to be problem-solving machines. So when there's a problem, it's the most notable thing. It's like, go look at this, go look at this and fix this one. Don't, you know, but— but this is

**Speaker B:** a really important subject because we are set up like problem-solving machines. And what does our mind do when there's no more problems to solve? And that's what meditation is.

**Speaker A:** Buddy, yeah, let's get going.

**Speaker B:** Go to any meditation community or any sort of like monastery and you'll see it in action. I remember being at a monastery and them getting in an argument for 45 minutes about what they were going to do about these frogs that were in this pond, and the frogs were eating the slugs, and they felt responsible for the death of the slugs. Because they had created this pond. And I was just sitting there like, are you guys like in, like, aware of like reality right now? Like, all of us are coming to your monastery and like, like, there's like so many other problems that you're discussing. Like, like, whether you're causing the frogs to kill by creating a pond situation. I was just like, oh my God, like, they are just creating problems that are not there. But our minds love to do that, especially in the West where everything is great. Like, realistically, we are well-fed, we are well-housed. It just takes going and traveling to any other place and seeing their reality and being like, holy shit, I have everything so well, and yet I'm creating all kinds of internal problems for myself, and I'm not able to handle talking to other people who also are clearly doing that. You know, who are like, what's your career going to be? And you're like, I don't know. Like, I have no idea. But there's something within me that starts to then create a problem and a panic for myself because it's like, holy shit, I'm getting pretty old and got to think about retirement. What's going to happen when my body doesn't work anymore? And oh my God. But the reality is, is like, how many people are starving in the world? In that we live in, that we're present in? Like, none. It's not happening, you know. It's just like, you literally have to be in like Appalachia or something like that, and we're not, you know. Because I got this argument from somebody, an American, who they were like, well, I think there's probably some like people that are really like inbred living in like West Virginia, Appalachia, that probably are starving to death because they're so remote. And I was like, but you're not that person and you'll never become that person. You know, like there's no stretch of the reality for you right now where you will ever be a person who will ever starve to death unless you like put yourself in some stupid survival situation. You know, it's an unrealistic thing.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, like chances of it happening is so low. Like a story of plane crashes on a desert island.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's so incredibly low. That like it's just not something to worry about. But the first thing you will hear from everybody when you talk to them is like, you know, as somebody who has like sort of an untraditional lifestyle, they're like, well, aren't you like scared? Like, what are you gonna do? Like when you just like, you know, like what's your future gonna be when you're like 65, 70? And I'm like, I have no idea.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I remember when I was in university, Anapanasati, I was looking for a house and I was doing a house share with a mate of mine. And I think there was like, one of these houses had like a problem with the smoke alarm or something, which actually, that is actually realistic, like a situation.

**Speaker B:** Like, yeah, that's actually fine.

**Speaker C:** And he was like, but it was something you could fix. Like, we could move into this house and get it fixed, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** And he was like, oh, I don't like this house because of the smoke alarm issue. Like, what if the house burns down? I was like, well, we could just like get it fixed. Like, man, like we're talking about living in a house for a year, like at least, right?

**Speaker A:** It's like a smoke alarm is like $10, $15.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And you're grasping onto this sort of reality that is not actual reality. There's nothing actually to be afraid of. And our minds love creating problems. When there aren't any problems. And especially when you get into meditation. But my favorite thing is like being in some sort of like, uh, self, like, isolation period where I'm clearly safe and clearly okay, and just seeing what my mind comes up with for problems in that situation, you know? Because like, it just keeps, it just keeps going, and you just have to keep reassuring itself that it's all okay, you know? The money's okay, the you're fine, you're well-fed, you're warm. Like, there's nothing physically harming you or endangering you right now. But yeah, but we've trained in the other way to be problem solvers, you know. And our minds can't just shut down just like that and see that there weren't any problems to begin with. It has to be a moment. And I'm not there yet, you know. I haven't gotten to the point where I can't create like false problems. I just speak of it because I see it all the time where I'm like, my new one for myself is, is that I just see it constantly where I like, I keep looking at my calendar over and over again thinking that I should be doing more things or thinking that I'm forgetting something because I have so little on my calendar currently right now. Like, I just, I don't have to do it. Like, for the next week, I don't have to do anything. And so you're a full Anagami in the winter.

**Speaker A:** I mean, of course, let's hope that that's the case, right?

**Speaker B:** But even, but even in the summer, even in the summertime, the reality is, is that like, I'm still kind of choosing whatever, whatever it is, you know? Like, that's, that's, that's the reality, is that like I don't have to do— there's very few things I have to do. That's just how my life is set up. But my mind, it goes crazy because it's just so used to being in college and then having jobs and having to meet people and fill out this form and fill out this and this bank account, this and this, that. Then I'm like, wait a minute, there must be something that I have to do. And I wake up and I'm like, holy shit, no, I don't have to do anything. But what do I want to do? What is my plan? Can I create something where I have a new way of looking at it without creating this sort of massive attachment there to it?

**Speaker C:** I feel like, yes, can we plan for the future without wanting?

**Speaker A:** I have a bunch of stuff to do, but I'm just like, we're good.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. And that's the way to do it.

**Speaker A:** And it works. That sounds like good times. I still don't have any catastrophes, or, you know, I'm not homeless, or, you know, anything.

**Speaker B:** That's the way to do it. And, but, but I, and I, I'm still doing things too, uh, and, but

**Speaker A:** I still make more problems for myself than I need, for sure. It's hard to get away from that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And so I'm like, right now I'm building a little cabin for myself, and like Yeah, just the attitude towards it is exactly that attitude that you're getting at of like, okay, whatever. Like, if this gets done today, that's great. If not, that's great. You know, that's the attitude to take with it and to not create these internal rules and be your own internal sort of like, you know, smacking yourself over and over again. Yes, slave master.

**Speaker C:** It's like that master-slave relationship. Whipping yourself into shape to do things.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's one thing I try to tell people, like if they ask me for spiritual advice, like I'm always trying to squeeze that in there, like don't be a slave master to yourself with this stuff because it's not, it's not the right way to do it and it usually doesn't work that well.

**Speaker B:** I catch, I catch myself sometimes when I'm, I'm like on my land and I'm like sitting under a tree, so I'm clearly following the Buddha's instructions and I catch myself being like, oh, but you're not— you know, when's the last time you've meditated by like sitting on your cushion in your meditation room? Like, you know, because

**Speaker C:** that's like— yeah,

**Speaker B:** it's, it's crazy that we're just like, oh my God, I cannot believe I'm still beating myself up like for this, like for not meditating enough. It's, it's so crazy that— yeah, because I'm like, oh, you're in, you're in

**Speaker C:** nature, it's so easy as well. Meditation, it's like the perfect excuse, right? It's the perfect excuse to beat ourselves up.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's crazy. And then you just notice it and then laugh at it and start again.

**Speaker C:** And look, you're meditating now. It's like Dhammarato says, it's like, well, you can meditate right now and you already are because you just realized that that's a thought. So you're already meditating, so feel good.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I find it helpful to like talk to you guys about it because then I can laugh at these ridiculous things in myself, you know. It's like you can step outside of your personality structure for a second and be like, wow, like, I mean, you guys can picture me. I'm like, I wake up in the morning, I'm like looking at my calendar, like a slight bit of panic, a slight bit of like, oh shit, I've got, I've got to get out and go do something, you know. And then I have to like calm myself down, like, and I do the

**Speaker A:** same thing over and over again.

**Speaker C:** It's almost, I feel like it's almost embarrassing, at least for me. To like just how much I actually have to self-soothe to overcome things that I know are irrational. I know that this is a silly thing to worry about, but I'm actually having to like take a couple minutes to just breathe deeply and calm myself down. And you know, it's— there's nothing wrong with that. Like, I, of course, I will go through this process, but it's almost embarrassing to have to spend 5 minutes calming myself down over something I know is It's ridiculous.

**Speaker B:** It's only like ridiculous to other people who don't understand what you're doing though, because like everybody else is like, why can't you just get on with it? You know, and like, you're like, hey, well, you know, like I've looked at my mind a lot and it works in sort of a different way now. And I'm just going to have to take a minute because I know it's beneficial for me and it might look weird to you, but I'm okay with that. I'm the weird guy anyways, so I'll take that 5 minutes, you know, and not feel weird about it, because that's what is the most kind thing to myself in this moment, you know. And yeah, you need a lot of nourishing because you've been doing the opposite for so long, you know. How many years of beating yourself up, you know? And I think you said that you were like a really good student, right?

**Speaker C:** In my last year of high school. Before that, I wasn't amazing, let's just say.

**Speaker B:** But you're beating yourself up?

**Speaker C:** Oh, in university I was, yes. In university I was very, very studious. I put all my stuff in on time.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and so obviously your method of doing that was probably to beat yourself up a lot, you know?

**Speaker C:** Yes, I was extremely disciplined, and it

**Speaker B:** was

**Speaker C:** fear and negativity that I used to motivate myself. And then when I got into meditation, I did the same thing, and I had this really bad habit of— and I still have a really bad habit of bullying myself to do, to take right action, to do the right thing, to motivate myself. I actually make myself feel worse in the moment to do it, and it's, it's really hard to break. Yeah, to actually be motivated while still— to be motivated without worrying about things, to be motivated to finish my degree and get a high-paid job without worrying about the future is extremely difficult for me.

**Speaker B:** And so you just, you take the moment that you're in and that is the moment when you're like, okay, I'm focused on the task that I'm doing right now with a lightness and a freedom. And you carry this freedom attitude with you through that task that you know is necessary. And you skillfully decide this is a time when I need to think about the future and I need to plan for the future. I'm going to set aside a time for myself to do that and focus on that. That's brilliant.

**Speaker C:** Yes, and then you don't have to worry about it because you know you

**Speaker B:** have a special time. You already did that. Yeah, and especially it won't come up in like meditation or anything because you're like, I've already done that. And when it does come up, you're like, wait a minute, I don't need to think about that. I've already done it.

**Speaker C:** I need to think about that. I have my special time. That's actually quite genius. I might do that.

**Speaker B:** I got to get an electric hookup at my farm. I'm just procrastinating about talking to an electrician, basically. The number of times I've had the conversation with the electrician in my head versus like— I only have to have one conversation for about 10 minutes But like the amount of time that I've thought about it otherwise, and it's like, wait a minute, it's totally irrational, you know?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, like I've been doing the same thing, and Brandon knows, because I've been procrastinating this for about a month now. Like a month, like getting my piercing changed. Like I was— I mean, this is like the piercing they gave me like when I first got it done, and now it's been like a couple months. Like I can go back and get the piercing changed, and like I bought all this jewelry but like I can't use it because like I keep procrastinating just calling and booking the appointment at the piercer's and I can't do it because it's Saturday today. And then the first 5 days of the week come around again and it's like, oh, I'll do it tomorrow, I'll do it tomorrow, I'll do it tomorrow. And a month later I still haven't changed the piercing. And it's like, what? It's like, that's not even like a problem. Like that's a fun thing to do. It's like, it's not even difficult. You're calling someone to go do something that will bring you like happiness. It's not even like that.

**Speaker B:** And it's okay. And it's okay to like, to like not get it done too. It's, it's just more— it becomes a problem when it's— well, that's exactly why

**Speaker C:** I keep procrastinating it, because it's like, it's a, it's, it's such a trivial thing, you know? Like, I know that it's just like—

**Speaker B:** yeah, but when you go over in your head, you're like, you're like, okay, you're playing out the future scenario of like what it's gonna feel like, what it's going to be like, like, and you keep like playing out this future scenario of like how you're going to talk to this person, what you're going to say to them. And like, that's when it becomes a problem because you're like, okay, I mean, I'm just spending way too much time on this and it's not getting done. So the best way to get things done is to realize that like, sometimes I like looking up stories of like different monks in other people's lives and stuff. Like Sadhguru is a good example of this where like the amount of projects that dude has worked on is absolutely incredible. You know, and you're like, how the hell do you manage to like get all this stuff done? Thich Nhat Hanh is the same way. Like when you look at his life history, you're like, holy shit, he did a ton of different things in different ways. And he like is like managing to like do like the number of books and all this stuff. Well, how does that happen? You know, it's like they're not superhuman. You have that ability within you too.

**Speaker C:** I don't know, man. I think there's a certain level of people people reach when their mind is so naturally purified that, um, that you

**Speaker B:** can, which you can reach also, which you can, which you also have within you.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I was talking to a guy last night, um, for about 8 hours, who had, um, he'd, um, he was a Srotapanna, I think, and he was saying to me, like, like, after he, he got his, um, like his realizations and stuff and like his progress, that he has a lot more like physical energy even. Because it's true, like he was actually saying, like we already have all this physical energy, but we have all this negative thoughts and mind chatter and stuff obscuring over the top of it. And he says that now that he's removed all of that, like to be productive for him, it's actually not even hard because he just— because that energy is all available to him now because he doesn't have because his default is like his default state, I guess you could say, is already so

**Speaker A:** peaceful, so

**Speaker C:** purified of unwholesome thoughts and emotions.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** So I think there is a certain superhuman-ness that some of these guys have tapped into.

**Speaker B:** But what— yeah, and they have— but you also have that with you. So like, you have that ability right now to also tap into this. And that's the key. Is that like you have the ability to maintain this attitude and this right attitude towards these sorts of things, you know, and like to change your way of thinking. It's totally within you. And so when we separate it and we are like, well, they were— it's sort of a mental thing that we do is we're like, well, they must have just been born a saint or something, like, you know, like there must just be something that's different about them. But no, it's like an ongoing process and an ongoing thing. And the opposite happens too a lot, that people get into spiritual circles and then all of a sudden they really don't get anything done and they become very selfish. And I've seen that a lot, that they're misconstruing the teachings a little bit and not really understanding that it is possible. Like Brandon said, you can just call

**Speaker A:** me out if you want to talk shit about me.

**Speaker B:** No, but you were— no, but you were just saying, like, how you can get things done and kind of have a laissez-faire attitude towards it. And then, miraculously, you get more things

**Speaker A:** in life no matter what, you know, all the problems, you know.

**Speaker B:** So you only fix one at a time.

**Speaker A:** Just be a chill no matter what, for the most part, I mean, there are some things that require a bit of, you know, speed and gusto, but for the most part, you can just let the things roll in.

**Speaker B:** And oh, you know, miraculously, at the end of it, you'll find that the turtle wins the race. You know, it's like the turtle and the hare again, you know, of like, you just, you just like, you take care of one thing at a time, and eventually it's It's not just a metaphor, it's actual reality. Like, often when people would ask me about my last farm where they were like, holy shit, how did you plant all that shit? Like, you must have had a ton of people working here. And I was like, well, I was here for 5 years and I didn't have a job. So like, how much time do you think that I had to plant things? You know, like, you're used to working in your garden for like a couple hours at a time. I was spending 8 hours a day every day in my garden. Of course the whole thing is going to be filled plants. Like, do you have any sort of understanding of this?

**Speaker A:** You would hope so.

**Speaker B:** Like, yeah, yeah, yeah, that'd be filled with plants, you know. But people were so amazed all the time. They're like, oh my god, it's just— it just can't be possible. And you're like, it— like, it's not even hard. It's really not. Because yeah, it's just one thing at a time though. You just— you take one task and you focus on that task. And if your task has to to be planning for the future, then you just spend the time doing it for that little amount of time that you do, and that's it. You know, if your task is healing childhood trauma, maybe that's what you want to work on for a little while. You know, you're like, you know what, I'm going to set a little bit of time aside for myself so that I can work on like just comforting the inner child within me, you know. And not a lot, I'm not gonna like make my whole life about it, you know. But every once in a while, it's worth it to spend an hour and do some sort of, you know, whatever. We all have trauma of some sort. We all— trauma is a bad word. We all have some sort of past, like, stuff within us that we suppress. Yeah, baggage. Yeah. So I'm going to spend a little bit of time dealing with it instead of thinking about dealing with it.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Instead of it coming up randomly throughout the day and just interfering with whatever I'm doing and spoiling my flow state. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** I mean, for that, there's a few inner child meditations that I haven't done one in a long time, but like, yeah, every, I don't know, like 3 months or 6 months or something like that, I'll do one. And like, you're like, okay, well, that's all that it is. And people can get really hung up on this. And I've been in a lot of spiritual circles where they're like constantly talking and thinking about healing trauma, getting back to this original pure state. And you're like, hey, you know, like, the pure state is right, right now. And it's again right now, you know. And you get really hung up on the past. And that's so these are the things to get to not get hung up. And it's a very easy solution, is like set time aside so that you do this. And not too much time, you know, because you know how much time you realistically need. You don't need to dig into your shit like over and over and over again, you know. My ex-wife, she like spends like, one of the problems in our relationship is like, it'd be like every day she'd be like doing some sort of like childhood trauma healing shit, you know, like some new shit. And I was just like, oh my God, like you gotta like function, you know, like you can't spend like 3 hours a day like, yeah, you know, you can't, you know, Probably, you know, you're supposed to let people do what they are going to do.

**Speaker A:** But after surgery, you don't have to keep ripping the organ out every day to look at it and then think and then have that as some type of healing.

**Speaker B:** Like, right.

**Speaker A:** You know, maybe you look at it and you understand it and you process it and then you let it do its thing for a while.

**Speaker B:** You put a bandage on it and you maybe put some some moisturizer on it, and then you wait, and then you let time.

**Speaker A:** And then you do an x-ray next time instead of ripping it out.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. Yeah. And I mean, honestly, I mean, I've been there too. I mean, like, when I was really into like ayahuasca and stuff, like, I was really like, I just gotta like just keep digging into my shit like over and over again and go deeper and deeper with ayahuasca. And like, eventually, like, this is just— and And then I was like, holy shit, I mean, this isn't actually going to end ever. There's never going to be a moment where whatever that difficult memory is that we're carrying with us is going to be completely eliminated. But I can relate to it in a different way. I can smile at it. I can like just be okay with it.

**Speaker A:** I think that sounds like amnesia instead of being a process. It sounds like Samadhi.

**Speaker C:** Glorified spiritual woo-woo, ultra-rare, isn't realistically ever gonna happen in your lifetime, supermassive jump in progress that for some reason have just been blown up over the years into just a huge big deal. Like, you always hear, like, I had this sudden moment in my psychotherapy session where I realized the truth of my trauma, I let it go, never suffered from it again. Yeah, the best one is Eckhart Tolle

**Speaker A:** at the beginning of the Power of Now.

**Speaker C:** Sells that book.

**Speaker A:** That doesn't mean it really works that way.

**Speaker C:** I was suicidally depressed and I suddenly had a thought: who is going to kill me if I'm me? Woke up, literally never suffered again, bro. I'm done, bro.

**Speaker B:** Like, what the fuck?

**Speaker E:** I don't know.

**Speaker C:** Come on, how many guys does that happen to? Like, one in a million, dude. Yeah, I mean, they get so glorified in our culture and stuff because it's like It's so cool, right? It's so easy.

**Speaker A:** That's why we focus on, you know, the Nibbana for everyone, not Nibbana for, you know, 0.00001% of the population is the method you want to choose to use.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally, totally. I think is really interesting because I agree that it does mislead people and think that because this happened to somebody else, it must happen directly that way for me.

**Speaker C:** Dude, I went through like— I meditated until I basically— up until I started learning from Dhammarato, which is kind of why I'm starting to become— why my pendulum's swinging so far the other way now to like the Dhammarato, like wake up now, now, okay, you know, like was because like I meditated for like years, like 3 years pretty much, like meditating almost every day and making my actual happiness Like, I made progress. I was able to get into jhanas temporarily, not off the cushion, and I was able to, you know, my technique at Vipassana improves, right? Obviously. But my actual baseline, like, state of happiness and my mood didn't improve. But I always told myself this is normal, right? This is fine. I'm not supposed to make progress now because it's all building up, right? It's all building up to the sudden moment where it's just going to snap and I'm going to become awake. And this was like my belief because that's what I've that's what like all the famous like book stuff say, right? Like the books all talk about like the sudden moment of awakening instead of like the gradual shift of becoming actually like happy as a person. And so I would never, I never actually thought it was a problem that I was like not progressing in my actual like, like actual Anapanasati level.

**Speaker B:** You were anyways, and you just didn't notice it, you know? So it's okay.

**Speaker C:** And it's like you said, like some of those skills come in handy now because like they're very transferable to gladdening the mind.

**Speaker B:** It naturally is doing itself also. If you're meditating and following some sort of tradition, it's naturally working its magic anyways, you know, is the thing that I see. Because we can beat ourselves up about it and be like, I spent so much time doing this like wrong practice, and then that's unwholesome too, you know, and not seeing that, you know.

**Speaker C:** Yes, that's a good point.

**Speaker A:** My experience with this is like I've had, I mean, at least, you know, one specific shift that seemed to make a huge difference that was rather sudden. I mean, really a number of them, but none of them work as well as building this skill. No, I'm not saying I'm the exception. I'm saying they still didn't work for my happiness as a whole, as well as building the skill to become happy now. And I would say Joe probably agrees with me because I think you've had a similar sudden shift happen to you and you still come here and stick with Dhammarato. And there's probably a reason for that. I'm assuming it's about same for you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, I like, it's just an experience, you know. It's like, it's like I, I don't even know what to make of it anymore because like I, I've framed it in so many different ways and in so many different like storylines around that specific experience or whatever, and other experiences too, you know. Like, but they're just, they're just experiences. And what has actually shifted my actual reality right now is all those other moments that I have worked on, you know, that, that are not so in focus in my mind, because each one is just as important as each other one, you know. Like, yeah, when I woke up to reality, they're just as important for building these skills, for building on themselves, you know. And yeah, I mean, like, if you keep holding out for experience— this, this is what our society does though. It's not just in meditation, it's also when you talk to somebody, like, I'm in my age group, I run into a lot of people who like burned out at their jobs, and then they talk about their recovery from how they burned out from their job, and they're like, and one day I was just, you know, just I figured it out, and I haven't had those feelings since then. And you hear this story all the time, and it's a repetition.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and then you'll hear that same story.

**Speaker C:** I just decided to count down from 5, and I got out of the bed.

**Speaker A:** About a different situation. So they'll say, well, you know, I wasn't happy after that, but you know, this new experience really changed things. And then they're really the same person. The same problem.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker] For me, what it's been with, like specifically with depression and dealing with depression for a long time, the length of time before I catch myself is so much significantly reduced. That's the big shift. You know, and the big shift like is not this sort of, I'm never going to be stuck in bed again. It's never going to happen again. Like I had that happen and I woke up and that's just it, you know. But like the reality is like how quickly you're going to go back to

**Speaker C:** sleep as soon as something like something bad comes up in your life, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah. And a lot of people, they go for a really long time living in delusion and they might not have— and

**Speaker A:** they don't prepare themselves because of that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly. And so I'm ready for the next time that some wave of emotion comes because I'm not scared of it anymore because I've explored it so deeply for so many hours. I know all of its facets. I know all of its tricks. I, you know, and I have my own tricks.

**Speaker A:** No, I do.

**Speaker C:** I don't know all of its tricks. No, I guarantee you there's gonna be a trick that's gonna come up when you're like 60 years old that's gonna completely blindside you and you're gonna be like depressed for a week, bro.

**Speaker B:** Okay, but, but I— but when I'm in the moment, that's— so, so here's, so here's the difference, is that I might get the depression and it might come up, but I know the tricks that my mind does to increase that, to make it worse. For me personally, what happens is it's like, oh my God, like it's so much effort to like get up and to eat or to go for a walk. Or to exercise or to have sunlight. That's just so much work right now. And that's my little mental game that I have with myself. And it's like, why don't you just keep laying here and like, you know, just, just, just be here. And then, and then it'll just all go away. You know, like if I just like keep laying here and this is the— this is what I'm saying when I'm like, I know the facets of it because I know the facets of it that's building on itself. And when that mind comes in and it's talking talking to itself. And it's like, okay, so you're feeling depressed and you're not being an internal coach right now. You're actually dragging yourself down more, and you're watering those negative seeds within yourself instead of watering the positive seeds that are also within you, you know. And you know the things, they're so obvious. Like, all these people who take like these courses and things like that on studying depression, it's like, that's actually an excellent point.

**Speaker A:** It's so simple.

**Speaker B:** It's really, it's really easy, you know. Don't be scared of it. Don't think that like this is going to like run my life and this is a permanent state. It's impermanent. It will change, you know, but reminding yourself of this, being conscious of it, like consciously bringing it up in the present moment, like this is going to change. It's impermanent. It's not a permanent depression state, you know, like, and not being fearful. Okay, so if it happened and I was 16, I was depressed for a week. So what? You know, like there could be, there could be a situation, you know, I could have something really, I don't know, really bad happen and my body might need to rest for a week, you know, and that's just reality. But not being fearful of it and thinking, oh my god, my life is ruined permanently and I don't see a solution out of this problem. But I can fix anything. There isn't anything in the world that I can't fix, you know. That attitude change, that's That's the big shift. It's not the awakening, the quick sort of momentary thing that happens, but it's this sort of attitude shift that gradually happens of like, I can handle this. Anything life throws at me, I can handle because I've handled crazy shit up to this point. I'm not scared anymore.

**Speaker C:** I think you're right, man. I think that's a really good way of framing it as well. I've handled everything up to this point, so like, what's the probability that I'm gonna handle the next thing? Very, very high, realistically. And I was actually falling into that same nitpicking trap that we just talked about when I discouraged you and I said, no, you can't, you're being a moron. Like, in a couple years you're gonna get depressed again for like a long period, you know, this happens to everyone. But I was actually nitpicking. That's a very small a small portion of your life that that's going to happen, right? The rest of your life you are going to be able to handle everything. So why was I nitpicking and focusing on this one tiny negative thing? The frogs are eating the slugs in the pond at our monastery. Yeah, but like, look how you've got a monastery to like live in, and like you have all these monks like teaching each other, and it's like, and all these people visiting it, right? I was actually falling into that same very trap. So thanks for pointing that out. That's a really good point.

**Speaker B:** It's because, it's because you're scared. You're scared of it because you've heard so many horror stories that are not reality.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I noticed that in myself. I'm scared of that week of depression that I know is gonna come up like in a couple years or a couple months. I know I'm worried about it, but just like, cares, I can handle it. And that's only gonna be a week, and then the rest of my time is gonna be like this.

**Speaker B:** Or when you're Anapanasati, it might be less than a week, you know. That's been my experience anyways, is like I just don't get depressed for more than like a day anymore. And most of the time it's like half a day. And I was somebody who was— it was just not like that before, you know. And that's the true— that's a true shift for me. And just seeing it minimize and minimize,

**Speaker C:** you know, like my ruts have— I still would— I still would definitely not say I'm the kind of person who wouldn't fall into like a depression that lasts a week or a couple weeks, but, but definitely my ruts in general are becoming shorter.

**Speaker B:** Like, yeah, yeah, yeah. What an overconfidence in practice. Is like a huge thing. So being realistic is great, you know, and being like, hey, this is realistically where I'm at. This is actually my reality. Because what you were getting at before when you're talking about other people's experiences and stuff is we're all lying to each other and we're all telling ourselves of like each other a false reality

**Speaker A:** that we're all dressing up to go to work in the suit when we're just guys who sit with basketball shorts on or fucking like joggers.

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** And watch TV at the end of the day. But we're all walking into the office in these polished suits with speaking language with no— yeah, it's all, it's all BS. Everybody's trying to maximize what their states feel like. Yeah, everybody's descriptions and have the most blown up descriptions ever. And you know, I've done that to you, Rob, I'll tell you now. Like, I probably have oversold a lot of things, or probably not. Maybe, I don't know.

**Speaker C:** Give me an example of something you oversold. I want an example. Let's make this real. Let's make this practical.

**Speaker A:** I don't know about it.

**Speaker B:** Come on, man.

**Speaker A:** Well, there were plenty of attainments that I claimed after I had my first cessation that were probably way oversold. But, you know, The idea is cool.

**Speaker B:** Okay, but that's not also to minimize that cool things happen with perception, you know? Well, like, this is the reality of life, you know, is that— because I know I've heard you talk about some of this stuff too, and then I've heard Rob say— I don't know about like Brandon and this like not feeling gravity thing, you know?

**Speaker A:** And I mean, that's still here, man. It's pretty cool.

**Speaker B:** But honestly, honestly, I can say that like if you, if you push your mind in a certain direction that certain weird perceptual shifts can occur, but it's not— it's not to be like— so

**Speaker A:** that's— that's— it doesn't matter.

**Speaker C:** Say that when I was talking about magic, that's exactly what I'm talking about, like weird altered states of consciousness, bro. That's what I should have said.

**Speaker A:** I've never heard anyone tell me that there would be a state where you wouldn't feel like gravity working the same way, and it could be called in a sense like zero gravity is just like, yeah, way to shortly describe it. And I started chasing after that state. I probably never would have gotten to this place, right? This was just a side effect of practice that couldn't— that I probably couldn't have really told was— have told was going to occur.

**Speaker B:** And we, and we all get caught on it too, because it doesn't, it

**Speaker A:** doesn't matter that much for your happiness. It is like an extra thing to use to gladden the mind. You can just say, well, you know, shit kind of sucks, but at least I don't feel pulled down by gravity the same way anymore. Or when you know, things suck, but at least I can feel the boundless space and consciousness aspects of the 5th and 6th Jhana whenever I want. But even they don't make you happier really in and of themselves. They become so boring and it doesn't really matter. Like, it's just a different way of perceiving things.

**Speaker B:** And you're stuck with language, unfortunately, which is really bad at describing what it is, because just like gravity is a concept, right? And so like, what I would describe could be the same thing, is like a feeling that you're not separated from the outside world and that you can't tell where the air starts and your hand ends, you know. And like, this happens sometimes, and it could be kind of the same thing, or this feeling of like melting into the couch sort of thing, that like if I direct my attention in that way, there is some sort of weird perceptual shift. But it's, it's a natural function of our bodies and stuff. And all it takes is like taking enough psychedelics to be like, okay, well, it's just some weird thing that's triggered in my mind. That I can't explain it. I don't know what it is exactly, but it's not to be looked at, and it doesn't inherently mean anything, you know, like it's not— and that's why—

**Speaker A:** that's where I think people will like the whole like Daniel Ingram school of like measuring like paths and stuff gets really hairy is because they start to measure these paths by these weird perceptual shifts as like, and some people might not talk about path. This means you're Arahant. And it's like, well, you know, if you look at those people by the old standards of like the fetters, almost none of them line up with anything on Srotapanna. And maybe, you know, I think, what is it? Do you remember? Is it Sokhagami? Or is there another way?

**Speaker B:** Sakadagami.

**Speaker C:** Second path. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** It's Sakadagami. Is it an S? I don't think it's S-A. I think it's Sukkha, maybe.

**Speaker C:** I'm not gonna— the hardest one to

**Speaker A:** remember, that's all I know.

**Speaker B:** But yeah, yeah, so it's a big problem when you, when you view this and then like some people, they just like don't put their attention in their practice on these factors. Because for me, like, I, I did so many psychedelics that like this stuff just like it always was totally uninteresting to me, uh, and I just didn't focus my attention on it specifically because

**Speaker C:** I saw— Oh, because you saw this supernatural stuff when you took the psychedelics, right? The altered crazy perceptual structures.

**Speaker A:** I mean, I just became normalized to him, it sounds like.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, exactly. So that, that became sort of like, yeah, I mean, I can bring up like, I mean, right now I can bring up mushroom visuals. I've done it enough, like, I know how to do it. You know, but like, what, just to have like, to have a light mushrooms experience, to have like tracers and things like that? I mean, it's not— but that's, but that's a natural process.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, HPPD or something, I forget what it stands for.

**Speaker C:** But is that normal?

**Speaker A:** Hallucinogenic perceptual psychic power persistent perception disorder or something.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it happens to a lot of people that take a lot of psychedelics. That's crazy. But it's not— but it's not— I'm not talking about like—

**Speaker E:** it's nothing.

**Speaker A:** It's crazy to me. Once you have that, it doesn't really make a difference in your life to any real degree that's positive, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** And the flushiness of it wears off.

**Speaker B:** Okay, go— like, it's a full moon tonight. Go stare at the moon for 2 hours and see what happens. Like, I challenge you to honestly do that.

**Speaker C:** Like, dude, I'm gonna do that. Just take a video and I'm gonna send it.

**Speaker B:** It's a full moon. It's a full moon. And go stare at the moon for 2 hours and see what happens to your visual field, because I cannot imagine—

**Speaker A:** candle for 2 hours, and, and then, right, and then close your eyes.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, the full moon sounds kind of like, kind of like spooky and exciting.

**Speaker B:** And like, full moon seems to really do it though, because like You might have to do it in the cemetery,

**Speaker A:** then you'll have some other, other hallucinations.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, like ceremonial.

**Speaker B:** No, but like, like I had to go through this, so I had to satisfy this like thing of like, like of experiences and seeking experiences and stuff, and then seeing like, hey, that's, that's not— like, I honestly, I don't think it has anything to do with any spiritual attainment or anything. It's just where I'm focusing my attention. And so what I realized after a while is like, I put a lot of attention on these sort of experiences and sort of the natural healing that I thought would happen from psychedelics, just because that was my idea of it, and not a lot of focus on right living and not a lot of focus on living in reality, you know. And so it was very imbalanced. And yeah, I mean, I spent a lot of years doing that. And then at the end of it was like, wait a minute, I'm still no better off. I still haven't actually, like, examined the realities of my anger and how it can hinder me on the path. I still haven't examined, like, jealousy and all these other things that we know. Like, it's Yeah, a great reframe for

**Speaker C:** that, I think, is when these negative emotions come up, instead of framing it as an unwholesome thought to get rid of, frame it as a potentially wholesome, previously unwholesome thought that could potentially become a wholesome learning experience. So you remove the Dukkha aspect, the actual essence of the jealousy remains, but without the suffering, right? So like, the best way to do this that I found is a reframe that I got from Alex, he says, "Good enough." So you say, "Good enough." So you say, "It's okay that it's here," right? And another one is, "I can make friends with this," right? So we do that, we remove the suffering, and then we can just investigate, like, why is jealousy coming up from, like, a place that's, like, already, like, not suffering from the jealousy, but investigate it. And now you can actually— you get the best of both worlds. You get the investigation into the negative experiences to, like, learn from them, and, like, see how like they're creating suffering for you, and you don't have to suffer while it's happening. So like, I think like, yeah, cut

**Speaker A:** out the ill will that's there and the jealousy and the hindrance and just say, wow, my room is really warm right now. This is a good— yeah, or you

**Speaker C:** could just shift your attention to something

**Speaker A:** else, you know, forget about it.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, but then you're at risk of not learning the lesson that jealousy has to teach. Not that there's anything wrong with that. If you've already learned the lesson a

**Speaker A:** thousand times, like the lesson of jealousy jealousy other than the lesson of jealousy

**Speaker B:** is not to be jealous. Yeah, the lesson of jealousy is to not be jealous.

**Speaker A:** That's all it is. It's very general. Intricate understandings of the way that your mind is jealous. If you can just learn how to not be jealous and not do it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, held by Sangha friends in Dhammarato's absence due to a neck injury, is a wide-ranging, informal discussion that touches on several core Buddhist teachings and personal practice. Here is a summary of the key themes and progression of the conversation:

### **Core Themes & Discussion Summary**

**1. The Two Arrows (Physical Pain vs. Mental Suffering)**
*   The talk begins with the news of Dhammarato's physical injury, which leads to a discussion of the Buddha's teaching on the "two arrows."
*   **The First Arrow:** Inevitable physical pain, illness, and discomfort that comes with having a body.
*   **The Second Arrow:** The mental suffering we add on top—our resistance, stories, and emotional reactions ("poor me," "this shouldn't be happening").
*   **The Practice:** The goal is not to eliminate the first arrow (often impossible) but to avoid shooting the second arrow by changing our relationship to the experience. By being present and equanimous with sensations, the mental suffering (and sometimes even the perception of physical pain) can lessen.

**2. The Nature of Pain, Suffering, and Advanced States**
*   The group distinguishes between **pain** (a sensory event) and **suffering** (the mental multiplication of that pain through aversion and stories).
*   They discuss **Nirodha Samāpatti** (the "cessation of perception and feeling"), a deep state where all sensory experience temporarily ceases. While acknowledged as a real phenomenon (even referenced in a scientific study), the consensus is that pursuing such "magical" or extreme states can be a distraction from the core work of ending suffering in daily life.

**3. Death, Rebirth, and the "Imponderables"**
*   A significant debate arises around what happens after death. Some participants, reflecting Dhammarato's (and Buddhadasa's) pragmatic approach, lean toward a materialist view: consciousness ends when the brain stops, as there is no permanent self to be reborn.
*   Others challenge this, arguing that if experience can arise once from "emptiness," it could happen again. The conversation concludes by leaning into the Buddha's advice that such questions are **"imponderable"**—speculating on them is a hindrance to practice. The practical takeaway is that whether there is an afterlife or not, the task of ending suffering **here and now** remains the same.

**4. The Heart of the Practice: Gladdening the Mind & Right Attitude**
*   The discussion repeatedly returns to the core of Dhammarato's teaching: the primacy of cultivating a **satisfied, glad, and wholesome mind state** as the foundation for all insight.
*   They critique approaches that rely on "brute force" or dwelling in mild dissatisfaction, emphasizing that practice should feel like **"freedom and ease."**
*   Key methods include:
    *   **Anapanasati (Mindfulness of Breathing):** Actively using long, calming breaths to gladden the mind, not just passively observing.
    *   **Mind Overcoming Mind:** Replacing unwholesome thoughts (anxiety, self-criticism) with wholesome ones (self-compassion, satisfaction) in a gentle, non-violent way.
    *   **Right Effort:** Skillfully nurturing wholesome states and letting go of unwholesome ones, not through struggle, but through wise attention.

**5. Navigating Difficult Stages (The "Dark Night")**
*   One member shares experiencing a challenging phase of existential fear and sensory overload, where reality feels "radically recontextualized."
*   The group offers supportive advice:
    *   **Prioritize Safety:** Don't drive or engage in risky activities if feeling unstable.
    *   **Maintain Practice & Routine:** Gently continue practice, stick to basics (eating, sleeping, walking in nature), and use the body/breath as an anchor.
    *   **Investigate with Stability:** Examine fearful thoughts from a place of relative calm, using techniques like broadening awareness to see thoughts as smaller parts of a vast sensory field.
    *   **Practice Self-Compassion:** Talk to yourself kindly, as you would to a frightened child. Understand that this is a temporary phase that will pass.

**6. Dhamma Theory as a Practical Guide**
*   The group reviews several core frameworks to ground their practice:
    *   **The 16 Steps of Anapanasati:** The full progression from calming the body to observing impermanence and letting go.
    *   **The Seven Factors of Awakening:** Mindfulness, investigation, energy, joy, tranquility, concentration, and equanimity.
    *   **The Noble Eightfold Path:** Emphasizing that "Right View" is an understanding born from practice, and that the path factors (like Right Livelihood) are meant to be practical guides, not sources of excessive guilt or perfectionism.

**7. Pitfalls and Encouragement**
*   They warn against **"spiritual materialism"**—chasing special experiences, attainments, or a new "spiritual" identity. These can become distractions.
*   They caution against making practice another form of **self-flagellation**, using discipline rooted in fear and negativity.
*   The ultimate encouragement is to develop **unshakeable confidence in one's ability to handle life's challenges** through practiced skills: the ability to gladden the mind, see through unwholesome thoughts, and meet all experience with increasing equanimity and ease.

### **Overall Tone & Conclusion**
The talk is characterized by **camaraderie, practical inquiry, and a strong emphasis on applicability.** The participants are less concerned with metaphysical dogma and more focused on tools that alleviate suffering in the present moment. The spirit of Dhammarato's teaching—**simple, repeatable instructions leading to a satisfied heart**—serves as the unifying thread throughout their diverse conversation. The key message is that freedom is found not in extraordinary experiences, but in the gradual, confident mastery of one's own mind and the cultivation of happiness here and now.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this conversation, the speakers use several core metaphors and stories drawn from Buddhist teachings and personal experience to illustrate their points about practice, suffering, and the path. Here is a breakdown:

### **Core Metaphors and Stories**

1.  **The Two Arrows (or First and Second Arrow):**
    *   **What it is:** A central metaphor from the Suttas (likely from the Sallatha Sutta).
    *   **How it's used:**
        *   **Speaker A** introduces it to explain Dhammarato's neck injury. The **first arrow** is the unavoidable physical pain (the injury itself). The **second arrow** is the mental suffering we add on top—resistance, thoughts like "poor me," fear, etc.
        *   **Speaker B** expands, emphasizing that practice is about learning not to shoot the **second arrow** into the existing wound. We can't always stop the first arrow (physical pain, life's difficulties), but we can change our relationship to it.
        *   The discussion evolves into differentiating **pain** (the physical sensation, the first arrow) from **suffering** (the mental multiplier, the second arrow). Speaker D summarizes: *"pain is inevitable and suffering is optional."*

2.  **The Arrow and the Doctor (An allegorical elaboration):**
    *   **What it is:** A story Speaker A recalls from a commentary. A person shot with an arrow refuses treatment until they know all the details about the arrow, the archer, etc.
    *   **How it's used:** It's presented as an analogy for spiritual practice. The "arrow" is suffering (dukkha). The story criticizes the desire to know all the intellectual details about enlightenment ("Who made the arrow? What's it made of?") instead of focusing on the urgent task of **removing the arrow** (i.e., practicing to end suffering here and now). The lesson is: practice first, theorize later.

3.  **Nirodha Samapatti / Cessation (The "Ninth Jhana"):**
    *   **What it is:** A deep meditative state described as the "cessation of perception and feeling," a temporary suspension of experience often placed after the formless jhanas.
    *   **How it's used:** It's brought up as the ultimate, albeit temporary, escape from the **first arrow**—physical pain. Speaker A mentions a story that the Buddha used this state to find relief from the pains of his aged body. The group discusses its mystique, scientific studies on it, and debates whether fascination with such "magical" states is a helpful inspiration or a distraction from core practice.

4.  **The Buddha's Life Story (A revised version):**
    *   **What it is:** Speaker B recounts an alternative, less mythological version of the Buddha's departure that Dhammarato shared. In this version, he was exiled due to a political dispute over water rights, rather than making a purely heroic, voluntary renunciation.
    *   **How it's used:** The story serves as a **meta-metaphor for not clinging to views**. It "kicks you out of your reality" and challenges fixed, idealized narratives. The lesson is to be flexible with teachings and not turn any story—even the Buddha's—into a rigid, permanent truth that limits your understanding.

5.  **The Tiger (Metaphor for Anxiety & Threat):**
    *   **What it is:** A common analogy comparing low-grade chronic anxiety to the intense, clear-focused fear of being chased by a tiger.
    *   **How it's used:** The group discusses how intense, immediate threats (**the tiger right here**) can paradoxically be easier to handle with presence, while the vague, lingering anxiety of modern life (**the tiger around the corner**) is often harder to overcome because it's a constant, low-grade "unsatisfactoriness" that doesn't force the same clarity. This ties back to the **second arrow**—the mental proliferation about potential threats.

6.  **The River and the Hill (Analogy for Perspective):**
    *   **What it is:** A brief analogy offered by Speaker A.
    *   **How it's used:** It describes the practice of gaining stability. When you're caught in negative thoughts and emotions, you're **down in the river**, being swept away. Practice allows you to get to **a hill**—a vantage point of stability—from which you can observe the river (your problems) without being overwhelmed by it. This connects to the advice given to Speaker E about finding stability before investigating difficult emotions.

7.  **Spiritual Materialism / The New Spiritual Ego (Conceptual Metaphor):**
    *   **What it is:** Referencing Chögyam Trungpa's concept, it's the idea of ego co-opting spiritual practice to build a new, "spiritual" identity.
    *   **How it's used:** The group identifies this trap. Speaker C mentions creating a "self that resists having a self." Speaker B describes it as the ego creating a new story: *"my new identity is to look into the separate self and find that there's no separate self there."* It's a warning against turning the path into another ego-driven project of self-improvement or acquiring special states.

8.  **The Turtle and the Hare (Implied Reference):**
    *   **What it is:** The classic fable.
    *   **How it's used:** Speaker B implicitly references it when discussing productivity and attitude. The "turtle" approach is consistent, steady, light, and free, taking care of one thing at a time without frantic effort (the "hare"). This applies to both daily tasks and the spiritual path itself.

### **Summary of Key Themes Illustrated by These Metaphors:**

*   **The Core of Practice:** Distinguishing between unavoidable experience (**first arrow/pain**) and optional, self-created suffering (**second arrow**). The goal is to end the latter.
*   **The Method:** Cultivating a **gladdened mind**, **satisfaction**, and **stability** (getting to the **hill**) as a foundation for investigating reality, rather than using brute force or dwelling in negativity.
*   **Pitfalls:** Getting distracted by intellectual speculation about enlightenment (**arrow/doctor story**), chasing "magical" altered states (**Nirodha Samapatti, siddhis**), or building a spiritual identity (**spiritual materialism**).
*   **Flexibility:** Holding all teachings, even foundational stories (**Buddha's life**), lightly as useful tools rather than absolute truths.
