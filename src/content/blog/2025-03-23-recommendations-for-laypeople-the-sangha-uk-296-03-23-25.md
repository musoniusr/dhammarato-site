### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Yeah, Dean, I'm not sure if I— if you've seen my last message I sent you on Skype, by the way.

**Speaker B:** No, what was that?

**Speaker A:** Uh, I think you wanted to call about something.

**Speaker B:** I probably— yeah, I did. Me? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Who are you talking to, Dhammarato or me? Oh yes, that's right. I would like for you and Dean to get together. In fact, while we're talking about it, to everybody there is a Facebook page called Open Sangha and that it needs some input, some tender loving care. So if you have the address to it, somebody can send a link or whatever. Both Kat and Dean are actually owners of the, uh, of that Facebook page. But I think anybody on any Facebook page can send a message to Open Sangha Foundation. Is that right, Kat?

**Speaker A:** I think so. I think so.

**Speaker C:** Uh-huh.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, actually, I misspoke. It's not Open Sangha Foundation. It's actually just Open Sangha. On Facebook?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I would like someone to do that, yeah, because I kind of am not so active on the internet and it would be really nice if someone could do daily posts because it seems Facebook, the whole algorithm and how it works, reacts really well to daily posts, like someone who can actually, you know, just post like some some picture or like, you know, like Dhamma quote or whatever, like every day. Yeah, that would be really nice. It's not so much work too, maybe like 10 minutes, 5 minutes. And you have Anicca now, you can just ask Anicca, you know, like, hey, give me a quote and a paragraph and like, that's like a couple of minutes. So that'd be really cool. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right. Well, let me make the announcement. This is the Sangha calls, the Sunday Sangha call. We have now moved to Discord, and so it's a different format due to the fact that Skype is dying. I think, in fact, that that was a good idea. You guys couldn't force me to come to Discord, but Skype killing itself has forced us to come over here. And I think actually now that I'm more familiar with Discord, it's good enough. In fact, it's probably better than Skype in some respects. And from what Mickey keeps pointing out to me is that Skype is for old folkies, and a lot of people won't even load the software because it's got problems and whatnot. And so they're much more willing to join Discord. And so, um, in fact, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 14 people are on right now, which is almost a record. Dietri may join us in a moment. I see her just now signing into Skype, and I know that she's on Discord. So normally when we start the conversation before we even turn the recorder on, but now the recorder is on, I'll put a few of you on the spot to give us a topic of what we're going to talk about today. Jesus, give us a topic. What are we going to talk about today?

**Speaker D:** I didn't think of anything today. Um, I have my own, um, question for you sometime, but I don't know if it's, uh, I was thinking lately about the body scanning and how the mindfulness of Vedana, that I am feeling that only being in my in my body all the time, that the part of the mind that used to plan and think about things is getting, I'm gonna say, weaker. That it's very hard for me to plan things or imagine things because I am the whole time in the body. I don't know if this is a topic for this call, but It's just something is happening to me, and I was thinking about talking to you about it.

**Speaker B:** All right, we can talk about that for a little while. If anybody has any questions, uh, related to this or anything else, please let me know so that we can continue the conversation.

**Speaker C:** Now I have another topic we could talk about.

**Speaker B:** All right, what?

**Speaker C:** Well, it was like the— I was wondering about the different teachings of the Buddha, like for lay people and for monks. They are like different people because they have different teachings. Because I've recently listened to one Dharma talk about seclusion. And hearing that— About what? About seclusion.

**Speaker B:** Seclusion? Yes. Yes.

**Speaker C:** Hearing that one, I was— it pretty much sounded like, even like for the light people, like practicing kind of— it moves towards like living the life as a monk. So I was wondering like, if there are any differences, if the Buddha might make differences in between these two groups.

**Speaker B:** All right. We can talk about that. In fact, let's talk about that first and then get into the body, because that's part of the topic. Actually, in the time of the Buddha, the Buddha did not make that much of a distinction between the Bhikkhus and the laypeople. Except that the lay people were not there very often, as opposed to Bhikkhus were around him all the time. And so people, lay people, would come to visit him, and it looks like it happened on a regular basis. So there was actually not much difference in the teaching, but rather the difference would be in the kind of questions that people would ask. And so I would say offhand that there was a whole— first off, there was a whole lot more lay followers of the Buddha than there were Bhikkhus. Massive numbers of lay followers were there, including at least 3 kings that were mentioned. Okay, King Bimbisara, And his son eventually took over from Bimbisara. I've forgotten his name, but the main king that communicated often with the Buddha was King Pasenadi. Now the interesting thing is that much of the communication between the Buddha and King Pasenadi was done through the queen, one of the queen's servant girls, and that she would come and ask the questions in behalf of the king. And the story is, is that she became Srotapanna. She was completely immersed in the Dharma, that that's the only thing that she cared about. And so that's the one that King Pasenadi would send to the Buddha to ask questions and things like this. There are also other lay people that got a great deal out of the Dharma. In fact, there was one— I've forgotten his name— that was specifically mentioned, and that he was well known to be able to teach the Dharma to both monks and laymen better than any of the monks that were around. And there was also a lot of interaction between monks and, let us say, spiritual seekers from a wide variety of practices that they had during those days. One group in particular that they had big interactions with was now what has become the Jains. Now, in the time of the Buddha, the Jains were not known as the Jains. In fact, the leader was called Nātanātaputta, and that he is now known as Mahavīra. And so a lot of the monks would communicate with various functions and various factions, and because of that, those people would then come and join the Sangha because they were already basically what you would refer to as a mendicant or a full-time spiritual seeker. And so many of the monks actually came from other organizations to where the laypeople would come to the Buddha directly because he had gotten some fame. And going back to the part of the story about one of them who was really, really good at it, was known to have become an Anagami, and that according to the old traditions, that's as high as a layman can go. But in order to attain that, you really have to understand the actual teachings of the Buddha and practice them. Now there's another sutta, number 31 in the Dhamma Nikaya, where the Buddha gives actual advice to laymen. And 4 out of the 5 I've forgotten because they were kind of ordinary, but one that really stuck for me was that a layman who is practicing the Dharma should give all of the duties and all the responsibilities over to the wife so that he can spend more of his time on the Dharma. That let the wife take care of the house, take care of the kids, choose what school and what clothing they wear, what vehicles we have, and all of that kind of stuff. And on several occasions I've swallowed pretty hard and just let Tam do what she wants to do. She just sold the truck and I went along with that. Pardon? What was that?

**Speaker E:** Anagami woman.

**Speaker B:** Does she have to leave.

**Speaker E:** The responsibility to her man?

**Speaker B:** Well, isn't that the typical way that it's done anyway? I mean, that's normal culture. But the, uh, the important, the important thing is, is to, as a layman, um, somebody's got an echo. So, um, the way to look at it is, is that we want to make our life as free and as easy of encumbrance as possible so that we can spend more time with the Dhamma, which means more time with friends in the Dharma, more time with noble people, more time hanging out alone. That in fact, that was one of the parts of the question was, what about seclusion? That the Buddha highly recommended to stay part of your day, part of your time in seclusion, to stay away from other people so that you can really listen and pay attention to what's happening on the inside. Wow, we're up to 19 people now. Hello, Dietrich, glad that you've joined us. Hello. I will tell you one story that I have heard when I was in India. It was one of the stories of Mullah Nasruddin, where as a mullah, the Muslim people in the town would ask him questions. And at one time he was confronted by a whole group of them about, well, what do you do? How do you spend your day? And the Mullah said that I only pay attention to important things, and I leave all the unimportant things to my wife. And they questioned him further, and he says, okay, all of the things that I leave my wife to do, all of the unimportant things, is the house payment for the house or cars or laundry or schools or whatever clothing we wear, what automobiles we have, etc. Like that. Now I'm kind of modernizing because this was several hundred years ago. And so they asked him, well, if the wife takes care of all the house duties, what do you do that's so important? He says, I have time then to figure out whether God exists, what is reality, etc. Like that. So as Buddhist laypeople, we can begin to do the same thing, is pay attention to what's going on and stay kind of away from ordinary normal society. An example of that would be if you're on YouTube, look at documentaries, come to our Discord group, look at Buddhist teaching discussion with Bhikkhuni, videos. There's a lot of them on YouTube. What's not worth listening to, what's not worth watching, is the events of the day. Why? Is because the news broadcasters Their job is to make you feel bad so that you keep watching the news. Stay tuned for tomorrow, something really bad is going to happen. Or, oh, watch this video because we've got breaking news. They often also start with, you won't believe who did what, in order to trap you into watching those kind of videos. And so they're in fact trying to trap you into watching the videos, and that the answer to that is, if you see that kind of thing like, oh, you won't believe what happened, don't watch that video because you probably won't believe what's happening. It's almost in fact an announcement for a lie. You won't believe it, it's incredible, which means that it's probably not true. And I find that quite often. That much of what is on the internet is not true at all. An example of that is, oh, Tesla is crashing, oh, Elon Musk is falling apart, oh, nobody's buying any Teslas, oh, the stock market has fallen completely. And then you actually look at what the stock market is doing, and yeah, it went down some, but it's not that bad. But they make it out as if it was an absolute disaster. So any disaster videos that you see on YouTube, don't bother watching them. All they're designed for is to make you feel bad. That in fact, you could say the same thing about ordinary people. Now in Thailand, things are different because the Thai people are ordinarily quite cheery. But the kind of people, especially like for instance on some of the Discord groups, the new people who come on, they come on to complain. And it's better not to pay much attention to the ones that are complaining. We got better things to do with our mind than listen to people complain, listen to the news broadcasters complain. We can go and spend our time either with noble friends, or better still, spending our time in seclusion so that we can watch ourselves complain. And catch that and make a change to it. So when we're saying going into seclusion, that doesn't take very much. The Buddha says go to the forest, go to the foot of a tree, go to an empty hut, go to a pile of straw. Well, I know many of you don't have piles of straw hanging around. In fact, many of you don't even have a forest to go to. And in fact, sometimes you don't even have a tree, but you do have your room. You do have an empty hut. And when I mean empty, I'm speaking specifically of empty of all people, including yourself. So you go in there and empty the self out of that room. Let it be an empty hut. And that's the place to sit quietly and enjoy. Enjoy, in fact, watching the body. Watching your mind, that in fact the Buddha talks about it in the sense of the Satipatthana, the four foundations of mindfulness, which are all on the inside. Now, before the Buddha's time, they had some level of sophistication. They had four elements. Now we've got 92 and counting. But in those days they had 4 primary elements, and that was solid, fluid, heat or fire, and air, which the Buddha then took that outside stuff and brought it in so that what we're actually going to practice is watching what the body is doing, watching the feelings, watching our attitudes and our mental states and what shape the mind is in. And then also looking at what's coming, arising and passing away quite rapidly, which would be our thought process. So this is what we're going to do, whether you're a monk. We've got two monks, I think, on. Where is 99 Months? She's still on. Yeah. All right. Hi, Chris. Hello, Dhammarato. All right, so Chris and Kathle are on. They're ordained monks, and that they actually have taken on the lifestyle of having very little to do. That's what becoming a monk is all about, is getting yourself into an organization that organizationally has it set up to take care of things. For instance, free rent. And also a little bit of exercise is required for free food. The robes are given out once a year at kathen ceremonies, and so you've got basically everything that you need already. So in the early years of being a monk, you want to get your mind together You want to find your own internal happiness and joy. You want to make sure that you understand the Dharma correctly so that in your later years you can spread that joy to others, either other junior monks or to lay people. Now, also in the time of the Buddha, the actual teachings of the Buddha were were fairly well secure because he had a friendship with the kings because of his family connections. He already knew them from a young man, and so he and the Bhikkhus were kind of under the political wing of King Pasenadi and King Bimbisara. After the Buddha died, the royal family, especially of King Bimbisara, kept that line open even down to Emperor Asoka, who became emperor. Think about 311 BC, which would be a good 100 years or so after the Buddha died. And that's when the teaching of the Buddha were quite open, but because it had royal patronage, a huge number of people that were already mendicants and religious leaders and all kinds of people, including some politicians and especially medical doctors, they all rushed to become monks, which then overwhelmed the number of Bhikkhus that had already accomplished the learning of the Dharma and the practicing of the Dharma. And so there was a lot of— then the way of saying it, it was a lot of kids or a lot of students were therefore teaching other students. In other words, the Buddha Dharma got watered down because of so many people who had come to become monks. And so there was the Third Council And in that council, there's ways of asking. You probably heard the expression, it takes one to know one. And so the nobles almost all knew each other anyway. And so they had a world conference, and most of the monks who had ordained more recently were not allowed in. Well, they got jacked out of joint and went and had their own conference, and that conference was called the Mahasangha. And that was actually then the roots of the Mahayana, where so much stuff that was not part of the teachings of the Buddha got piled into the Buddha-Dharma. Or let us call it the birth of Buddhism. So the birth of Buddhism happened about 100 years after the Buddha died, and that the teachings were modified, watered down, and over the past now 25 or so hundred years, that's continued to happen with more and more and more watering it down. But we want to make sure that we're actually going back and teaching exactly what the Buddha taught. Now, even the suttas have been modified and changed, and in fact, a lot of the suttas are of later origin. But the actual teachings of the Buddha are the same as they've always been. And the important point about it is that these teachings are noble. They're liberating. A way of talking about it is that this is a cure for the spiritual disease that everybody has, and that Buddhism at its best is only working with the symptoms, like psychology. Psychology doesn't ever cure anybody. What they do is get you hooked into paying for more and more and more therapy. It's like Pfizer and the other pharmaceutical companies. They don't want to research to get medications that actually cure people. They just want to solve the issue of the symptoms so that people keep taking their medicine. And so they can have then a patient is taking medicine for 20 or 30 years. But if they actually had medications that did the cure, then the person would stop taking the medicine. And so you could say then that also Buddhism from that time, especially up until now, is working with the symptoms to keep people involved with it rather than the cure. Now, actually, you can cure yourself and then catch the disease again, and then cure yourself again, and then catch the disease again. But once you learn how to cure the disease, you can gain the skill of curing the disease, and so you can keep curing the disease over and over and over again until eventually You don't keep catching the disease anymore. Your cure becomes permanent. Now, what do we mean by that? Is that the entire teachings of the Buddha, he said, was good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end. So if you were doing some sort of spiritual exercise that is not good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, is probably not the teaching of the Buddha. The examples that I have for that is retreats. When people go to these retreats, a 10-day retreat, a 7-day retreat, or whatever like that, the students will often struggle. Well, if they're struggling, that means that they're not practicing correctly. That the practicing correctly would be to look at what the body is doing so that you can change it. Look at what the feelings are doing so that you can change them. Look at what the mind state is in so that you can change it. And first of all, look at what the mind state or the mind's objects are, the thoughts, the flashes of memory, other things like this, whatever is happening in the moment. Now, the interesting thing is, is that the body, the feelings, the mind, and the mind's object is the old way from Arya Vedic times, the old way of talking about the elements. But the way to practice is actually backwards from that, that where we're going to start is starting with the thoughts. And when we start with the thoughts, then as we practice well, we can begin then to modify our attitude and then modify our feelings so that we can take over the feelings, and eventually we can relax the body. Now, I'm not saying that it takes years to practice this Sati Pitana. In fact, the easy way to talk about it is, is that somebody goes to a retreat and they're saying, okay, I'm going to be watching just the contents of the mind now. So the body and the feelings and the mental states can stay in the kuti, stay in the bed, and I'm only going to go meditate with just taking the mind objects into the meditation hall. You can see how silly that is. Oh no, you have to take all four of them there with you, which means that one by one, as they occur, whenever you see— for instance, if your body is in pain, pay attention to the body. If you're all worked up, feeling bad, or got a problem like that, recognize that that's probably an emotion or a feeling. Let's work on that right now. Or you can actually see that the mind states are actually the attitudes that we have, is often the underlying cause of why we have unwholesome feelings, or excuse me, unwholesome thoughts. So the way to start then is first by start to look at these thoughts that you have. Now, I just had a conversation with someone on Discord when they were saying, oh, some of the thoughts are very subtle. Oh, these are such subtle little thoughts. And the answer to that was, if you don't see it coming, it's subtle. That's like subconscious. Imagine a big rig truck barreling right down on you. If you don't see it, you'll call it subtle. But if you can see it, it's not subtle. You can see it. So subtlety is only meaning that you're missing, you're not looking. And so what we develop is we develop the ability to really look at the thoughts that we have, and then we can begin to look at what kind of attitude we have, what kind of mental states that we have. And then we can begin to look at the feelings and change those. And in the process, we can relax the body. Now, we can in fact fairly quickly bring breath into it, in the sense of as soon as you see that thought and recognize it's unwholesome and change that thought to, wow, what an unwholesome thought that was. We can take that breath right then and there. But ultimately what the breathing process is, is to be able to get in touch with the body to see any tensions, any anxieties, so that whenever any anxiety comes up, you can breathe that out. And then you can have that sigh of, wow, what a relief it is. So this is the way that we practice the Satipatthana. And that the Buddha recommended that we do this Satipatthana in the way that's called Anapanasati. Now, the word Sati actually means to remember. I know that in the West they've changed the definition from to remember, to be in the present moment, into what they call mindfulness. Well, you can mindfully chew somebody out. You know every word that you're saying. Accept that you're not paying attention. You can say, oh, I was paying attention, but these thoughts and feelings were subtle, which means then really not paying attention. So the skill that we develop is the skill of learning to look and to see what we used to think was subtle but now is in fact quite clear quite obvious. The other problem is, is that it's hard for beginners to see what is wholesome thought and what is unwholesome thought. And so the way that I would say to get started is to say that if your thoughts are about the past, even yesterday, never mind deep dark past, but if your thoughts are yesterday, they're likely to be unwholesome, and you're likely to get tripped up. An example of that is some old person who is in a rest home, and the family comes in and talks to them, and they'll reminisce about something that happened when they were a child, and they're very happy about that. But as they're reminiscing, they remember something bad that happened, and now they feel bad because they were thinking about something bad that happened. 50 years ago. And the Buddha would recommend that while we're practicing, let's practice being here right now. What's happening right now? What thoughts am I having right now? And if the thoughts are of the past, let's change those to the thoughts of what's happening right now. Thoughts of what's my attitude right now? Is my attitude that of, oh, I need something, oh, I want something, oh, I'm a victim? Or is the thought or the feeling, or excuse me, the attitude of, wow, this is great, wow, we can do this, everything is really cool? Because if we can begin to change that attitude, then we can change the feelings. Now the Buddha recommends the feelings that we're going to be working with are going to bring us to the point very quickly, by the way, within a breath or two of that you actually recognize that you're safe. So if you have thoughts of something dangerous, you can immediately recognize, oh, it's dangerous only in my mind. The reality is, is that in this present moment, it's not dangerous. I made that shit up. We make up our dangers because we want to remain safe. When the reality is that we could just see the reality to recognize that right now I am safe. So I can feel safe, I can feel secure. Resting the body is then allowing the body and the mind and the feelings to become comfortable. Now, a lot of the meditation practices that you'll find in the West actually are intentionally making someone uncomfortable in the body. For instance, sitting long periods of time that you're not used to sitting, sitting for an hour, sitting in strong determination sittings, sleep deprivation. All kinds of practices have sneaked in under the name of Buddhism. But the Buddha taught differently. He taught us to relax the body and to become comfortable relaxing the body in our feelings. Because if we're not safe, we're not secure, we're not comfortable, then it's impossible to feel satisfied. But if you can feel satisfied, if you can feel safe, secure, and comfortable, then you can feel satisfied. Now, the important point that I'm making here about satisfaction is that that's really all the Buddha taught. He taught Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. He taught the Four Noble Truths in the sense of being able to see the Dukkha, recognize that you're creating it yourself right here, right now, mostly through your own ignorance of not watching the thoughts, thinking that they're subtle. And we can change that immediately into being satisfied, the Third Noble Truth. Well, Western Buddhism is thinking that the Third Noble Truth is way off in the distance. I've got to wait, I've got to struggle, I've got to fight, I've got to do this, that, and the other thing. So think of it like this, is that the Eightfold Noble Path is not actually a path, it's more of a method. When we think of a path, we think of something distant, like, oh, I can become satisfied once I reach a distant place. And the right way to think of it is, is that the door that you're looking for so far away is actually right there in front of you. Bring mindfulness to the fore, bring it right here, because the door to satisfaction is right in front of us. All we have to do is to remember to look at the mind, to look at the feelings, to look especially at the thoughts that we're having so that we can see that they're uncomfortable and then change them. We can also start resting the body more, that we can see if there's any tensions, any anxieties, or if the body is actually feeling comfortable. So this is something to pay attention to, because the body's not comfortable, the feelings are not going to be comfortable, and then you're not going to be having the feelings of satisfaction. So we have to pay attention to the body. That's part of the process. We also have to pay attention to the mind state, because basically there's two mind states. I know that there's others listed, but the basic two mind states is the mind state of a victim or the mind state of a winner. Fritz Perls talked about it in the sense of bottom dog and top dog. Fritz Perls, a famous psychologist from the 1950s and '60s, he had good diagnostic capabilities just like Freud. The problem was that their diagnosis didn't give the cure. They were able to diagnose things fairly well, In fact, we've got a whole book now of diagnostic codes and a whole vocabulary. Oh, he is compulsive-obsessive. Oh, he's got post-traumatic stress disorder. Oh, he's got narcissism. Oh, he's a psychopath. Oh, there's this and that and many different labels, hundreds of labels. However, There's no cure for this other than maybe taking some pills occasionally, but those are still not the cure. At best, they're only going to work on the symptoms. What the cure is, is to see that right now what we're doing is unwholesome, keeping our mind in a state of unwholesome, staying in a state of a victim, and we can change that right here, right now. But we have to practice doing that over and over again, because guess what? Our habits are going to take us back into unwholesome. Now, where did these habits come from? They came from— actually, in a way, you could say that we were born with them. We were born with instincts. We were born in ignorance. But over time, as we were raised, we were raised by ignorant people. And so they actually ground that ignorance and the lies that they were told and the lies that they tell the children are ground in, but they're not deep. That's an important point. Some people I've heard— in fact, Kat can remind me of that. He talked to, on the phone, he talked to some high-powered, important meditation teacher who shared with him that, oh, I still have defilements, I've got to go deep in meditation. Do you remember that conversation, Kat? She's got to go deep into meditation to get rid of the defilements.

**Speaker A:** Maybe this was Bhikkhuni's idea, that you have to kind of bring up this stuff in a kind of therapeutic setting, that that's the way to deal with the defilements, to actually bring them up and to kind of, yeah, go deep into that kind of experience, I suppose. I think that's what you're talking about because I can't think of anything else.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I remember you talking about it in detail more than a year ago. With me about it. Okay, so here's the important thing, that that's very common in the West, that, oh, I've got these defilements and I have to go deep into my meditation in order to deal with these defilements. And that's not at all the teaching of the Buddha. The teaching of the Buddha, in fact, is if you see that defilement come up, or in fact if it does come up, see it. And if you do see it come up change it right then and there. Don't worry about the roots of it. If there's any deep, deep seeds down there, they'll eventually all come up, and every time that they come up, you whack them off. So there's no reason to go deep at all, but there is a good reason to pay close attention. Ivan, you had your hand waving. Do you have a comment?

**Speaker E:** It's always interesting because I remember quite a few comments on like people talk about shadow work, like something by Carl Jung, Western psychologist. He's a, like, I remember there's a quote people post often, it's something like, the tree can only reach heaven if the root the root reach to the deep of the hell. Kind of like, you know, you have to dig out those deep stuff. And I always find it interesting and very inaccurate because I remember you told me the tree, the roots of the tree can only go like 6 or 12 inches the deepest, like kind of go deeper than that. And I look it up, it's true. And I always find it interesting, like why do people make it like as if it's very deep? It kind of reminds me because I was those people back then, and I really feel like a victim every time I think about it. Oh, it's so deep. Oh, there's so much more. And I really hate those messages. It's so wrong. It's very unskillful. Yeah, it's not that deep.

**Speaker B:** Right. But in fact, what you're talking about is that the roots of trees Real trees in the forest or wherever you go, the roots of trees do not go deep. Why is that? Because deep in the ground there's nothing but rock and mud. There's no nutrients. Worms don't dig deep. Worms are right there on the surface, and therefore so are the roots of the trees. They don't go deep. There's no reason to put down a root that far, but what there is a reason for the tree to do is to put out a lot of roots fairly close to the surface. Okay, so that means then that your defilements or your unwholesome habits or your unwholesome thoughts or your unwholesome attitudes are going to come right to the surface. There they are. For you to see it. Another quality of that issue about going deep is because they have the idea that they're— that these, uh, defilements are subtle, they're hard to see. Well, if they're hard to see, that just means that we're not looking. And so if we, if we actually look right now— and so the whole, uh, a, let us say, practice would be to get away from other people, sit down and start looking at the thoughts and the feelings that you have with the intention of making an improvement right then and there. Almost any thought that you have can be improved. Then in fact, if you had some super duper exalted kind of thought, if you had a super duper wonderful marvelous attitude, that can still be changed because you can congratulate yourself for having that marvelous attitude. So in fact, that's where we're going to be going with this, is to give yourself credit for the fact that you can practice correctly. Give yourself credit for that. This is something that's on the Eightfold Noble Path that few people understand because it's badly translated. Right Noble Thought is actually not the right translation, but Right Noble Intention is a better translation. But an even better translation would be Right Noble Attitude. And we're going to develop that attitude, and the way that we develop it is by over and over and over again, we get it. We We do feel satisfied. We do see that this is good enough. This is marvelous. And so that confidence that I can do this grows. And that's the intention of the practice of the Buddha, is keep practicing until you know you've got it without a doubt. Why? Because you've been practicing, you can be seeing it, You can do it. In fact, that was what you were talking about, Jesus, before, is that all you have to do is just sit there and relax. Relax the body, relax the attitude. You can do this. One point that I'll make, and this is— I make this one almost every talk, and that is in Sutra number 48. There are 7 knowledges, and the first knowledge that the Buddha says that is noble— in other words, the actual first step on the path— is the step of knowing that when there is a hindrance there, you know that you can get rid of it. Now, most of the people, in fact, you've talked to them, oh, I can't. Oh, I know I've got unwholesome thoughts, but I I can't get rid of them. That's just the victim. That's just the loser's attitude. We can change that attitude over time. We can change it better and better into, oh, no matter how obstructed the mind gets with defilements, no matter how obstructed it gets with hindrances, I can change it right now. I can come out of that state and come into the state of seeing the way things are directly to see the truth. And the truth is, is that things are not bad at all. Things are pretty good. In a way, you can say that you live in a paradise. This is nice. Can you understand that in fact, if you pay attention to the reality of your mind, you can change the reality of your mind to align with the actual reality? That you could actually say that what Dukkha is, the dissatisfaction, is when the mind is not aligned with reality. It's aligned with our old habits, the old lies that we've told ourselves. So the actual practice then is to practice to be here now, to look at what's happening right now, to make a major beautiful change to what's happening right now, And to get a big load out of that is great. You could do this whether you're a layman or whether you're an ordained monk, but the ordained monks have a chance of doing it more often, but a lot of them don't. They're too busy doing things, monthly things, rather than actually cleaning out the mind. So it's actually possible depending upon your own, let us say, uh enthusiasm, that your enthusiasm can actually take you further than if you were ordained. But if you are ordained, that gives you a lot of time to be really enthusiastic about getting your mind together. So we can rest the body, we can see the anxiety,. Then in fact, you can actually, having watched a video, then you can come back and look at the body and you can see there's tension, there's anxiety. All the movie or the video that I was watching was not all that wholesome, and it's left residue of anxiety. Yeah. All right. What do we want to do with that? We can say ourselves, I'm finished with that video, and now I'm going to make myself comfortable. I can take a deep breath. I can relax. And within 1 or 2 or 3 breaths, depending upon your skill level, you can actually breathe out that anxiety. If there's tension, if there is restlessness in the body, if there's restlessness in the mind, you can actually breathe that out. The human body is actually a biochemical, electrochemical mechanism. There's no self in there anywhere. But because it's a biomechanical electrical system, that means that we can put some new input in it to change that electricity, to change that chemical makeup, so that we, instead of being uptight and anxious, could be relaxed and easygoing. And everything is okay. In fact, you can breathe out most of those chemicals. This is why the Buddha talks about it in the sense of a long breath, taking in a long, easy, deep breath and a long breath out. Why? Because ordinary breathing doesn't release the body's chemicals as easily. That our shallow breathing doesn't purify the body near as well as long, deep, slow breathing. That's why I recommend to take that breath of, and wow, that feels nice, that feels good. So this is how we practice with the body, but we have to remember to do that. We have to also have thoughts along with that, is, wow, everything is okay. We can in fact have deep breaths and happy thoughts, or let us say a relaxed body while we're thinking that the mafia is coming for us. Let's not think about the mafia coming for us. Let's not think about the cops coming for us. Let's not think about the neighbors coming for us. Let's not talk about what the news is coming for us. Let's say that right now they're not here, they haven't arrived yet. Let's be comfortable right now. That's the way we practice, is to forget about what happens in the future, even if it's in the immediate future. We can just say not yet, not yet. There is a story, by the way, is a really old story. I don't know where it came from or how long ago it was, but the tiger was chasing a monk and the monk was going up the hill to get away from the tiger. And all of a sudden he reached a precipice, the cliff. And so he crawled down that cliff. And hung on by roots and branches of a tree while the tiger was above and there was a deep crevasse below. And while he was hanging on there, he noticed that there was a flower. And so he looked at that flower and says, my, this is a really, really nice flower. I'll just pay attention to this flower and pay attention to what's going on. And you know something? Tiger got bored and left, and so now he could easily climb back up. But most people, if they are in that situation, they're going to be in panic mode, and by panic mode they're going to be clinging, and by clinging they're going to get tired, and then they might fall. So let's live our lives as if everything was already okay. Here's another example. That you're flying in an airplane and the airplane sputters. It's a little Piper Cub or something, and the engine's not running anymore. And so it's time to bail out. And all of a sudden you recognize that the parachute is not there. So what do you do? You bail out anyway. Well, are you going to be worried about what happens when you land? Because you, I mean, If you're careful, you can probably glide yourself to where you can land in a tree or land in water, but if you're terrified, you're probably going to land wherever it happens. But the important point is that on your way down, you can have thoughts about, "Wow, this is a great view!" "Wow, I can see your house from here!" That's the kind of feelings that we want to have. It doesn't matter what's going to happen in the next 5 minutes. What needs to happen is that right right now you're okay. Develop that. Develop that. Develop the feeling that everything is all right. Everything is okay. We can take that deep, easy breath. What a relief it is. So, you know, we've had 24, 25 people on this call. That's quite amazing. So does anybody have any comments or any things to say? Anna, I'll give you first shot at it. Anna, are you here? Yeah, I see you smiling at me. Turn your mic.

**Speaker F:** On.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, thank.

**Speaker E:** You.

**Speaker B:** That's very funny, the story of the tiger and the.

**Speaker G:** Monk.

**Speaker B:** Very nice. Yeah, live your life as if the tiger is going to get tired of waiting and he's going to leave, that you're actually safe. So Ivan, what do you have to.

**Speaker E:** Say? I was just thinking about— I remember there's a thing Arahant called where he said, I can't remember the context, but basically, even if he's in an airplane and it's crashing down, he will still continue taking another nice breath. I'm butchering here, but something like that. And I like that quote a.

**Speaker B:** Lot. How about you, Jesus?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, a comment about the— well, I'm feeling great being in the body most of the day, hanging in the body and relaxing the body all the time. Feels great. Yeah, what is something Something I think I can be unbalanced is that the part of the mind who is like in charge of getting the things done and plan things is getting like this muscle is getting weaker. And over the last couple of years, the last couple of years, I feel like maybe it's unbalanced. I'm getting a bit worried about I cannot plan simple things like the.

**Speaker B:** Other.

**Speaker D:** Some time ago I was in the WAT and I needed to prepare the parking lot and it was like kind of overwhelming, like, oh wow, this is so difficult because I'm all the time in the body and feels great and maybe, maybe an advice of how to balance this because— All right.

**Speaker B:** The way, the way to balance that is to go have fun cleaning the parking lot. Go see that parking lot as, oh, this is an adventure, let's go have fun doing it. That in fact, a couple of things that come to mind, and one of them is an episode out of the book Tom Sawyer written by Samuel Longhorn Clemens. They talked— they called him Mark Twain— to where Tom Sawyer was ordered by his aunt to paint the fence, and he went out there and he was painting the fence, and Huckleberry Finn came by, and they started to talk. But while he was painting, he started having fun at it, and then he told Huckleberry Finn, wow, this is a whole lot of fun. I'm having fun painting this fence. This is really great. 'You want to try it?' And so Huckleberry Finn said, 'Yeah, I'll try it too.' And so he handed him a paintbrush, and eventually the fence got painted, but Huckleberry Finn did a lot of the work, and Tom Sawyer could just rest and enjoy the fact that he tricked his friend into having fun painting the fence. So you could do that too. You can trick yourself into having fun doing what you're going to do anyway, and you're going to do it miserably because you'd rather go do something else. So you can do anything that you want to do and have fun doing it instead of worrying about, "Oh, it's going to take a long time," or like with a computer, you're doing stuff on the computer, "Maybe it'll never work, maybe I won't be able to do this. All right, and those are thoughts of defeat. In fact, if you have that thought often and more often, oh, this is hard and I might not be able to do it, you'll probably quit before you actually fix it because you feel so bad. But if you have that attitude of, oh, this is a lot of fun, I can go have fun cleaning the parking lot, then in fact a monk comes by and you start having a chat with him, you can tell him, oh wow, how much fun I'm having cleaning this parking lot, why don't you help me, you'll have fun too. Or you can be miserable and then he doesn't have anything to do with what you're doing. But if you're having fun at it, people want to join in on the fun. Does that help you answer that question for.

**Speaker E:** Yourself?

**Speaker D:** Yes, in part. The other part is the ability of planning or the ability of doing intellectual stuff is getting harder because I am so happy in my body that I don't want to get out. You know, that's the other part of the question.

**Speaker B:** Well, you're kind of making a choice then between am I going to feel good or am I going to work? And the answer to that is you can do both. You can feel good and do what you need to do and have fun doing it. You don't have to make a choice between feeling good and working and feeling bad. That choice, by the way, was something that you started doing when you were in early primary school, that almost no kid likes school. Does anybody here remember that all 12 years you went to school that you enjoyed every day? No, everyone here got into the habit of not liking school, not liking doing what we're supposed to do. But in fact, the only good part of school is recess, except when the bullies are out on the recess ground. All right, so we get into the habit of that our work is not playful. But you'll get better at it. That in fact, the students who really like math and have fun playing with math are the ones who wind up being world-class mathematicians. The same thing with music. Kids who play music, let us say in the high school band, or they're playing it and they're taking lessons or whatever, and they're not enjoying it, they'll probably quit playing the piano. But those who really enjoy playing the piano, they may become world-class musicians. And so that's the way to look at it, is go play with whatever you're going to do, whether it's cleaning out a parking lot or writing an email. Enjoy what you're doing, but you can't do that unless you're well skilled and well practiced. That's why we start with the seclusion, so that you can get your mind together. If you're not enjoying your meditation, how the heck are you going to enjoy cleaning a parking lot? So this is how we talk about it, that the Buddhist teaching of the Buddha is good in the beginning, so that we really begin to enjoy what we're doing while we're secluded. Oh, this is so nice. That's the way we practice, is to really enjoy it, so that eventually we get to the point of there's nothing left. What are we going to do with nothingness? We're going to enjoy. There's nothing to do, no place to go. Isn't that marvelous? And even then, what joy we have becomes empty, and that's okay. But if you live your life working, trying to attain something— that's the problem with the spiritual disease, is everybody is working really, really hard to get really spiritual. They think that enlightenment is a tough job. They think that they have to work at it, and you'll not get that joy, you won't get that peace by practicing wrongly. Enlightenment, the best thing to say about it is, there's nothing to.

**Speaker E:** It.

**Speaker B:** There's nothing there. It's just a label, and boy, look at the Westerners, they claim that label: "Oh, I'm an Arahant! Oh, I'm a Srotapanna!" Oh, look how hard I tried. And all I'm asking you, Jesus, is just enjoy playing. Just enjoy cleaning the parking lot. Ben, what do you think?

**Speaker A:** Really enjoyed the call, Dhammarato.

**Speaker H:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** It is really nice when.

**Speaker H:** You realize.

**Speaker B:** That you can always come out of unwholesome.

**Speaker E:** Mhm.

**Speaker B:** If you're paying attention. If you're not paying attention, you'll call that subtle. Oh, it's too subtle, I can't see.

**Speaker C:** It.

**Speaker B:** All right, it's not subtle, you're just not looking at it. Kimo, what do you.

**Speaker E:** Think?

**Speaker B:** Your mic's.

**Speaker H:** Muted.

**Speaker E:** He said his microphone is not working yet.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I hear. I see that. All right, but I hear you.

**Speaker C:** Anyway.

**Speaker B:** Or was that somebody else who said that?

**Speaker E:** No, I said his microphone is not working.

**Speaker B:** Oh, all right. So Chris, what do you think? Are you— are we having fun.

**Speaker E:** Yet?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, loads of.

**Speaker E:** Fun.

**Speaker B:** Maybe you could leave us with a parting.

**Speaker E:** Thought.

**Speaker B:** As someone whose full-time job is to hide in his kuti and deconstruct his brain, sometimes I worry that there's— you can't think too much. Well, have fun deconstructing your brain. Have fun. Fun. In fact, I would recommend that you use a very, very sharp scalpel and cut closely. Be sure that you don't disturb the thing while you take it out of your skull so that you can smash it properly. The question I wanted to ask was— yeah, you don't have to deconstruct it. What you can do instead is just watch what it's doing happily. Aha, I see you, Mr. Department. Aha, I see you, unwholesome thought. You don't have to destroy the unwholesome thought, just change it to a happy thought. So I leave you with this thought: don't worry about deconstructing the mind, be happy. So, Deidre, what do you have? What's your thought about today's.

**Speaker E:** Call?

**Speaker F:** I think it's a nice summary.

**Speaker B:** Of.

**Speaker F:** Several talks you gave. Nice summary again about how to practice and how to live and how to be happy. I think that's nice. Sometimes a little thought like I had is that sometimes I wake up, I have this great ability to worry. Sometimes I wake up and then I've dreamt not all too well, or that's sometimes hard to get out of it. I see, oh, Mara, I see you, Mara. I'm worrying.

**Speaker E:** Again.

**Speaker F:** But still, it's really like a worn-out path I keep on walking. Like worry.

**Speaker B:** About— And when you see that worry, it's not subtle anymore. The worry is subtle because we can't see it. But once we can see it, we can say, "Hot dog, I don't have to worry right now.".

**Speaker F:** That's it. Not right now. I don't have to worry.

**Speaker B:** Don't have to worry right now. No. Hey, Carl, what you up to? Do you have any comments to.

**Speaker E:** Make?

**Speaker A:** No.

**Speaker B:** Comments. Good to see.

**Speaker E:** You. Always a.

**Speaker B:** Pleasure. Santiago, what do you have to say? It's great. It's a good way to start my morning. Thank you. All right, how about you, Andre? Do you have something to say? How about you, Paul? Good to see you, glad you joined us.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** A happy mind leads to a calmer mind.

**Speaker B:** Is that a correct statement?

**Speaker E:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker B:** It's always quite joyful joining these calls. I'm glad to have you. So, Jonas, do you have any last.

**Speaker A:** Words?

**Speaker H:** Well, I can say I enjoyed this call a lot, a lot. And I'm amazed by how most of the times after the call I'm left with like the sense of, well, there are actually no questions whatsoever. You can just relax, take it easy, take a deep breath, and it's all good.

**Speaker B:** It's all good, will always be.

**Speaker H:** I can handle it, whatever comes up. So it's always like really good to be reminded of that. So thanks a lot.

**Speaker B:** Thanks a lot for the call. Excellent. Timo, do you have something finally to.

**Speaker A:** Say?

**Speaker B:** His microphone doesn't work on Discord. Okay. Jose, how about you? Do you have any last words? I can see him talking and I see the microphone is not muted, but I don't hear.

**Speaker C:** Him.

**Speaker E:** It should— wait, it's not working.

**Speaker B:** All right, never mind, we're okay. Thank you anyway. Mikey, can you take this call.

**Speaker E:** Home?

**Speaker G:** Yeah, thank you, friends, for being here today. If you could go ahead and put a date and time in the one-on-one calls channel here on Discord. We like to make new friends here in the Sangha. And it's a great opportunity to talk Dhamma.

**Speaker E:** Call. Maximum.

**Speaker B:** Capacity. Pardon, what was that, Ivan?

**Speaker E:** Uh, maximum capacity, like this call could only reach 25. I'm still trying to figure out how to Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Oh really, we made the maximum on our first try. Wow, that's amazing.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, for a second.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, thank you all for coming. I will be here next.

**Speaker E:** Week.

**Speaker B:** Thanks, everyone.

**Speaker E:** Bye-bye, everyone.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) with Sangha friends, focuses on the core practice of the Buddha's teachings as a direct path to happiness and liberation, accessible to both laypeople and monastics. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: The Direct Path to Satisfaction**
The central message is that the Buddha's teachings are a cure for dissatisfaction (*dukkha*), not a distant, arduous path. Liberation and satisfaction are available **here and now** by skillfully working with the mind.

### **Main Teachings & Discussions:**

1.  **For Laypeople & Monastics:** The Buddha's core teachings are essentially the same for everyone. The difference is in lifestyle and opportunity for practice. Lay practitioners are encouraged to simplify responsibilities, seek noble friendship, and dedicate time to seclusion and Dhamma study.

2.  **The Practice of Seclusion:** Crucial for progress. It means creating quiet time alone ("an empty hut") to turn inward, observe the mind, and disentangle from the "news" and distractions of the world that are designed to generate worry.

3.  **The Four Foundations of Mindfulness (*Satipaṭṭhāna*):** This is the practical method. However, Dhammarato emphasizes a dynamic, **backwards order** for addressing hindrances:
    *   Start with **thoughts**: Recognize unwholesome thoughts (often about past/future) as they arise.
    *   Change the **mental attitude/state**: Shift from a "victim" mindset to a "winner" mindset.
    *   This change alters the **feelings**: Anxiety and worry can be replaced with safety and comfort.
    *   Finally, the **body** relaxes: Deep, conscious breathing releases biochemical tension.

4.  **Correct vs. Incorrect Practice:**
    *   **Correct:** Making the practice **"good in the beginning, middle, and end."** It should feel joyful and relieving immediately. The goal is to see a hindrance and know you can let it go *right now*. Satisfaction (the Third Noble Truth) is accessible in the present.
    *   **Incorrect:** Practices based on struggle, endurance of pain, "digging deep" for buried traumas, or viewing enlightenment as a distant goal. These are seen as working with symptoms, not applying the cure.

5.  **Key Analogies & Instructions:**
    *   **The Tiger & The Monk:** Even in perceived danger, choose to focus on the beauty of the present moment ("the flower").
    *   **The Falling Airplane:** On the way down, choose to enjoy the view. Cultivate the attitude that "right now, I am okay."
    *   **Painting the Fence (Tom Sawyer):** Bring playful joy to any task, even mundane chores. You can be happy *while* working.
    *   **Tree Roots:** Defilements are not "deep"; they surface constantly. The skill is to "whack them off" as they appear, not to go digging for them.

6.  **Critique of Modern Buddhism:** The talk suggests that much of modern Buddhism has become watered down since the Buddha's death, often focusing on rituals, complex doctrines, or harsh ascetic practices instead of the simple, joyful cure the Buddha taught.

7.  **The Role of Joy & Confidence:** The practice builds **confidence** (*saddhā*)—the knowledge that you can always come out of an unwholesome state. This confidence is nurtured by repeatedly experiencing the **joy** and **relief** of letting go.

### **Answer to a Practitioner's Question:**
In response to Jesus (Speaker D), who felt his planning ability was weakening because he preferred staying in a relaxed, bodily-aware state, Dhammarato advised **not to see it as a choice between feeling good and being effective**. Instead, bring the same joyful, playful attitude cultivated in meditation to daily tasks. Integrate the happiness *into* the action.

### **Conclusion:**
The talk is an invitation to a simple, direct, and joyful practice: **Seclude yourself, watch your thoughts, change your attitude to a happy and confident one, relax the body with breath, and experience satisfaction in this very moment.** The path is about remembering and applying this cure whenever dissatisfaction arises.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Speaker B, likely Dhammarato) uses several metaphors and stories to illustrate Dhamma points. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Spiritual Disease & Cure:** The core teaching of the Buddha is framed as a "cure for the spiritual disease that everybody has." He contrasts this with modern "Buddhism" and psychology, which he says only work on the "symptoms" to keep people dependent, likening them to pharmaceutical companies that want lifelong customers rather than providing a real cure.
2.  **The Door is Right Here:** The Noble Eightfold Path is reframed not as a long, distant path, but as a "method." He uses the metaphor: *"the door that you're looking for so far away is actually right there in front of you."* Satisfaction (the third Noble Truth) is immediately accessible, not distant.
3.  **Tree Roots:** To counter the Western psychological idea (e.g., from Carl Jung) that you must dig deep into your past to heal, he uses the metaphor of **tree roots**. He states that tree roots don't go deep into barren rock and mud but spread widely near the surface where the nutrients are. Similarly, our defilements and unwholesome habits are not buried in a deep, inaccessible subconscious; they surface constantly where we can see and "whack them off."
4.  **Subtle Thoughts as an Unseen Truck:** To explain "subtle" thoughts, he says: *"if you don't see it coming, it's subtle. That's like subconscious. Imagine a big rig truck barreling right down on you. If you don't see it, you'll call it subtle. But if you can see it, it's not subtle."* The problem isn't the thought's subtlety, but a lack of looking.
5.  **The Biochemical Body:** The human body is described as a *"biochemical, electrochemical mechanism"* with no inherent self. Because it's a system, we can "put new input in it" through breath and thought to change its state from anxious to relaxed.
6.  **Worn-Out Path:** When a participant (Deidre) mentions a habit of worry, he implicitly references the metaphor of a *"worn-out path"* in the mind—a neural pathway that's easy to fall into out of habit.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Mullah Nasruddin Story:** He tells a story about the wise fool Mullah Nasruddin. When asked how he spends his day, Nasruddin says he focuses on important questions (like whether God exists) and leaves all the "unimportant" things (house payments, chores, etc.) to his wife. The speaker uses this to illustrate the Buddha's advice to lay practitioners: simplify your life and delegate worldly duties to create more time for Dhamma practice.
2.  **The Monk and the Tiger:** This is a classic parable. A monk being chased by a tiger hangs off a cliff, clinging to a root. Above, the tiger waits; below, a fatal drop. Instead of panicking, the monk notices a beautiful flower nearby and focuses on appreciating its beauty. Eventually, the tiger leaves. The moral is to *"live your life as if everything was already okay"* in the present moment, rather than panicking about perceived dangers.
3.  **The Falling Airplane/Parachute:** He extends the theme with a hypothetical: you're in a crashing plane with no parachute. While you can't control the landing, you can choose your attitude during the fall. You could think, *"Wow, this is a great view!"* The point is that we can choose a joyful or peaceful attitude *right now*, regardless of the impending outcome.
4.  **Tom Sawyer Painting the Fence:** Referencing Mark Twain's story, he recalls how Tom Sawyer transformed a chore (painting a fence) into a desirable game, tricking his friends into doing the work for him. The lesson is that we can "trick" ourselves into finding joy and playfulness in any task, rather than approaching it with drudgery.
5.  **Historical Anecdote - Watering Down the Dhamma:** He tells a historical story about the period after Emperor Ashoka, when many people (doctors, politicians, etc.) rushed to become monks for social prestige, not for practice. This "watered down" the teachings because inexperienced students were teaching other students. This led to the Great Schism (Mahasangha), which he calls *"the birth of Buddhism"* as a watered-down religion, distinct from the original "cure" of the Buddha's Dhamma.

### **Summary of Rhetorical Purpose**
The speaker uses these metaphors and stories to make several core arguments:
*   **Accessibility:** The practice is about changing your mind **here and now**, not digging into the past or striving for a distant goal.
*   **Joy as the Path:** Practice should be **good in the beginning, middle, and end**—joyful and relieving, not a struggle.
*   **Clarity Over Subtlety:** Problems seem "subtle" only when we aren't looking properly. With right attention, they are obvious and manageable.
*   **Prioritization:** A lay practitioner should structure life to maximize time for peaceful, secluded reflection.
*   **Historical Critique:** Institutional Buddhism often obscures the simple, effective "cure" with complex rituals and difficult practices.
