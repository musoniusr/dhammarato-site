### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right. Oh, Avery, good to see you again, and thank you for asking this question, um, about seeing the dangers in unwholesome thoughts. That's an important part of the practice, as I had just said before we put the video on, is having an unwholesome thought is unwholesome, and we have the, let us say, the results of those unwholesome thoughts almost immediately, like anxiety, tension, restlessness, worry. But if we wear ourselves out with those unwholesome thoughts, then we'll become dull. So these are the hindrances. If we in fact though have thoughts about how dangerous those unwholesome thoughts are, now we're having wholesome thoughts. The wholesome thought is seeing the danger, seeing the disadvantages to those unwholesome thoughts, recognizing what they do to you. And seeing that they are doing that to you, then by having the thoughts that this unwholesome thought is in fact unwholesome, that's a wholesome thought. And it can be taken to an extreme in the sense of you demand of yourself to stop having those unwholesome thoughts. But this is a kind of more advanced kind of thing, that right in the beginning for all students, we would use a diversion tactic. For instance, when the unwholesome thought comes up, we will change it to a wholesome thought. To remove the unwholesome thought with a wholesome thought. The Buddha has a little analogy about a carpenter and the carpentry back in those days. They didn't have any nails. What they had was pegs that they would hold pieces of wood together by being able to drill a hole through it and then pound a peg in. They use pegs, in fact, even in wooden ships, even until the last several centuries. So the Buddhist says, in order to remove a peg, the peg that you're going to— that you're going to remove that peg with another peg. The new peg, the Anagami peg, is a smaller peg than the big peg. So we take a smaller peg and drive out the bigger peg. So that smaller peg has to be kind of in a middle path or middle place, in the sense that if the smaller peg, or the one that you're going to drive out, is too big, then it's not going to do its job. And if it's too thin or too narrow, then it's also not even going to do its job, but it'll be damaged or broken. So we have to have a peg that's substantial enough to drive out that unwholesome peg. And this is where the Buddha refers to it in the sense of gladdening the mind or brightening the mind. That we can drive out those pegs with a wholesome thought. And so this is where we get started. But now, surprisingly enough, all on your own, you're bringing up step number 2 that the Buddha refers to, and that is by seeing the disadvantage in the unwholesome thoughts. And therefore we can take those unwholesome thoughts and change them into seeing the danger. And so this is a very good practice for you that you can, you can recognize. For instance, when you're out in a crowd and somebody says something that is a criticism or something that you don't like, if you take that in it will be painful. So if you can see immediately, oh, if I listen to what he has to say and take it in, I will cause myself great harm, great Dukkha. Now most people, when they get criticized, they just feel bad. But you, now that you've gotten on the path, can say, wait a minute, let's not take that thought in, let's not harbor it, let's not own that thought, because if I do, it will cause harm, it will be to my disadvantage. And so then we can say other things about it, like, uh, this guy really doesn't know who I am anyway, that who he's talking about is the Avery in his mind not the Avery in my mind. So he can criticize some Avery all he wants, but it's not me.

**Speaker B:** That helps. Yeah, I actually did notice that at one point the other day. I had a— it wasn't— I don't— it wasn't like— it was once I was like walking down a hallway and someone said something to me or like made fun of like my hair or something. And I was sort of like, well, what he's criticizing or what he's talking about, like, doesn't really, like, that person doesn't really know me at all, so it doesn't really hold any weight.

**Speaker A:** Can you repeat that? I'm having a little trouble hearing you.

**Speaker B:** Is the audio on my end like a little bit choppy?

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** Is there a choppy audio on my end?

**Speaker A:** It's not choppy, it's muddled, as if you're not close enough to the microphone.

**Speaker B:** Something— okay, sorry.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Um, well, I was able to notice criticism and say like Well, the person they're criticizing, like those qualities, like that's something that they've kind of made up on their own and it's not just like me. So I've noticed that from time to time. Yo, did you get that?

**Speaker A:** Yes. I was just thinking that if we can remember to look at what we're doing, remember to see, then we can make choices about it. And we have several choices. So, one of the choices would be, to gladden the mind. But in fact, in that situation when he's criticizing you, one of the things that you could say is, well, thank you very much, that's very interesting information. I'll investigate that. So you turn it around on him, that he expects when he's criticizing you to get flak back. Can you remember not to give the flak? And you remember to turn it around to something joyful and wholesome and grateful. That will certainly stop a lot of the unnecessary Dukkha, the unnecessary stuff. Because if he criticizes you and then you criticize him back, now you're in a big argument.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I was curious about something.

**Speaker A:** Say again.

**Speaker B:** Do you mind if I pivot topics?

**Speaker A:** Yes, go ahead. You have another question? Sure.

**Speaker B:** Once you've managed to get the mind in a calmer, more relaxed, or like better state, state, what, what do you do once you do that? Is there— can I— how does investigation sort of work? Like, understanding, like, like, what are— what are— who I am in the present moment? I've heard a lot of that stuff on YouTube, and it's, it's been interesting because it's like, people will be like, people who meditate for a while will understand that, like, like the present moment kind of like, and the sensory information is sort of like, it's like all there is, like the present moment, the sensations and the emotions, like that's kind of like all that we really experience in the present. So I don't know what to, how to kind of start investigating or what that would mean in the context of the Dhamma.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's in fact correct. Reality is only what's right now. And yet human memory is all about the past, and human intellect is all about the future, about what's not happening in the present moment. But everything that's real is real now. For instance, you had a favorite cup that you drank out of. While you're drinking from that cup, it's real, it's right here. But when it's in the kitchen and it's out of your mind, then it's not real. But if it does come into your mind, it's still not real until you go into the kitchen to get the cup. Now here's the thing. Perhaps the cup breaks. Maybe you got it as a special gift. Maybe it was at a state fair where something happened important, or maybe it's got a good design or something like that. And so you really like this cup and then it's broken, which means that now, well, if you're in Japan, you might want to try to glue it back together. But look, but normally we don't. We just throw it out. But then when we have thoughts about that cup later, it's not real anymore. It's gone. It was changed, right? So this is what that teaching is about, is that only what's real is what is now. And the past is not real. It's dead. It's gone. And that if we dwell in the past, then, or long for the past, then we're not really in the present at all. And not only that, but more than likely we're going to be in bad feelings. Now, the reason for that being true is that the way that the human brain functions and works is that when something is dangerous, then we remember it much better. Why is that? Because of the self-preservation instinct. And so we tend to remember the things that are dangerous in order to avoid them in the future. All right, so if something really pleasant happens, you might remember that. But a whole lot of stuff happens and we don't remember at all. Then in fact, we could go to a college lecture and not remember much of anything. Nothing, right? And, uh, this is, uh, the point about being able to investigate or pay attention, because if we are investigating and paying attention, then we're much more likely to remember it rather than just remembering the things that hurt us. But through life, we wind up remembering a whole lot more of the things that hurt us than the things that would do us good. And so this is why over time we begin to feel bad. Is because we're remembering the things that hurt.

**Speaker B:** That's a really interesting— I hadn't really thought about that before, that the mind remembers things that are dangerous over things that are actually beneficial. Yeah, I'm trying to figure out how to, like, what my kind of next step is, because when I practice for about 5 to 10 10 minutes and I get myself feeling good. And I think that's like perfect, that's like great. But I don't know, I don't know, I guess what I'm asking is what next? Just okay, because I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Well, a lot of people have the idea— it's a very Western kind of thought— that Buddhism is all about meditation. And it's not at all that. In fact, this is a funny little story. I've said it before, but Catlin is here on the island and he has been over to Wat Ruapah Siang Tong before. He knows the abbot there. And then he came to do a retreat at Deepavaram, and now he is in this conversation. He was on his way back to the wat. Wat Ruesipha Siangtong is a very nice wat here on the island, and they're treating him well. But one of the conversations that he said that he had had with the abbot before when he was there before, he said that the abbot said that all of these Westerners who come to his wat are only interested in sitting meditation, and they sit around all the time. Now, this is something that a Thai monk who has been a monk for more than 20 years is surprised at how Westerners are so enamored by the sitting meditation. And so I asked Bhikkhuni, "What do they do?" And he says, "Well, in the evening chanting, after the chanting, they will sit for a while, maybe up to about 45 minutes, but that's the only time that they sit in meditation. That the rest of the day, they spend in a different kind of meditation." an active meditation of remembering to be in the present moment, to be here now, to watch what's going on. And this very much goes with what is found in the suttas, that going to the forest or to a foot of a tree or to an empty hut actually has the quality of seclusion. And getting off by yourself is very, very important when we're practicing. But in the normal day-to-day life that people have, even inside the temple, they're not sitting most of the time. Like, for instance, you're going to school, you're doing things, you've got your life to live. And that you're not ever intending, at least not now, to spend 14 to 16 hours a day sitting on the floor someplace in Burma. That's not your intention. Okay, which means then that our practice of Anapanasati is not going to be done in a formal sitting posture. It's going to be done in the here-now. About what's happening right now, if we can remember it. And so there are several things. One of them that I've actually mentioned before, which I'll mention again so that maybe we can grind it in— if you really pay attention to what I'm saying, it will be of great value to you— and that is that when we're paying attention to what's happening in the present moment, That means that we're going to pay attention to the body, we're going to be paying attention to how we feel, we're going to be paying attention to what kind of mind state or what mood that we're in, what's our attitude now, and also what's in the thoughts. So this is the four aspects of the Satipatthana. Now another point which is actually very much in part of this is that we have 6 senses. We have 5 senses that take in data from right now, and then we have the 6th sense, which is often not in the present moment, that the thoughts that we're having are thoughts of the future, thoughts of the past, thoughts of someplace else, thoughts of people who were not here, etc. And this is where we spend most of our time, is in that sixth sense, the mental sense.

**Speaker B:** Okay, that's— yeah, that's it.

**Speaker A:** And so what we can do is spend more time in the other five senses. With our eyes, we can look. Often we've got our eyes open, but we're not actually using them, and we're not thinking. We're not looking at what we're looking at, we're looking and thinking. We look a little bit and we do a lot of thinking, we look a little more and we do a lot of thinking with our eyes. And so the idea then is to start remembering that, "Oh, I've got these eyes, let me use them more. Let me look and look and look and look and look, rather than look and think and look and feel." This look, the same thing is true with music, that in fact this is one of the training of musicians, is they learn to listen and listen and listen and listen, and not so much thinking. And when you're really listening to a piece of music, you're listening to it, and then a thought will happen, a thought will occur. When we're thinking about the music that we've just heard, we're not listening to the music that's happening right now. All right, so we have the eyes and the ears, and we also have the sensations of the body, which is a powerful one, and that basically from childhood, little children in Western society are both taught and are diverted from the body itself. For instance, toddlers fall down a lot and they cry. They don't like it when the body gets hurt. So children learn to avoid paying attention to the body. Even when girls are putting on makeup, they're not interested in what it feels like this makeup on their face. What they pay attention to is how they look, and they're not really paying much attention to how they look because they're really thinking about in the future, how will I be accepted with this particular paint job, right? And so it's a very much future-oriented thing. So one of the ways that we can bring the body back into the present moment is with the breathing. And also, you have heard possibly enough about various systems. You've heard of the Gowanka Method, and that one of the aspects of the Gowanka Method is what they do is body scanning. To make the body alive, to make it alert. Okay, so one of the things that we can do in the present moment, just by, you know, for instance, looking and using the eyes, or listening and using the ears, we can also pay attention to how the body feels, especially with the breathing. Normally what happens is that the body will be in a state of tension, and the state of tension is what you would call unconscious or subconscious. We're not paying attention to it until it gets big enough, and then we'll see it. But we're not looking at it in the subtleties.

**Speaker B:** That's really interesting, actually, because where— oh, that makes a lot of sense, actually. Yeah. Uh, so then, like, even then, like, uh If— yeah, I want to— I want to— what I want to do is I want to wake up more to it.

**Speaker A:** To— all right, well, here's, here's one of the ways of doing this, is by start paying attention to what the body is doing. If you, uh, if you have a— let us say if your feet are crossed at the ankles, a lot of people when their feet are crossed at the ankles, one of the feet will be bouncing up and down. If you've heard about a man spread, where guys will spread their legs for dominance, okay, that's a posture that we should become aware of. Also, if the foot is tapping, we should know it. If there is tension, for instance, people will move their legs back and forth. Subconsciously swinging their knees, bouncing around and whatnot like that. So the body is doing things in the here now, and we're not even aware of it. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** I'll just maybe, maybe now I've been, I've been paying a lot of attention to the thoughts up until this point and like kind of working with the thoughts, but maybe now I could start to check in with the body and see how the body, the breathing feels too. And then I've got two of the, like, major— like, two of the biggest, like, sensations, like the thoughts that are happening and then how the body is feeling.

**Speaker A:** All right, so one of the things that we can do then is to play little games, like make-believe— make-believe rules, not real rules, but make-believe rules. In the sense of don't touch your face. Okay, now that's actually quite cultural in many places, that it's a social faux pas to play with one's face, to play with one's hair. But it takes some mindfulness to remember to look at what the face is doing, to look what the hair is doing, and specifically to look what the hands are doing. That we do a lot of scratching and movement of the hands subconsciously, that people will play with their hair. They'll do this and that and this and do a whole lot of touching of the face without even knowing it or noticing it. Yes, exactly. And today, maybe when we talk about it today, it'll be a second hit in the sense of getting it in. Okay, so the first time that we talked about it, it really didn't get in, but today maybe it will get in so that you can start watching what your hands are doing, paying attention to them, and be in the here now.

**Speaker B:** I am a complete beginner, but I will do my best.

**Speaker A:** Well, don't try to do your best in the sense of in the future, but make a point of that. I am going to remember to look at what the body is doing, and don't chastise yourself when you're failing to do that. Be happy that you can remember when you do remember. Aha, I am watching my hands. Okay, now there's another point about it, and that is to learn about the sensations. The example would be, you have you ever heard of the word Mudra?

**Speaker B:** Hmm, it doesn't— it might have, but it doesn't— I don't remember the definition.

**Speaker A:** All right. The word Mudra actually has the word 'mu' in it, which has to do with the hand. Okay, so the mudras are actually hand positions. And you know in Buddhism that there are a number of famous hand positions. One of them is this, another one is this.

**Speaker B:** I can't actually see your hand.

**Speaker A:** Another one is touching the ground, another one is this. Okay, and so beginning to notice the hand postures and begin to put the hands in those kind of postures. All right, so here's another thing is we can begin to play with the fingers to get the sensation. All right, here's a question for you. When you touch your two thumbs together, which one feels— can you feel the feeling from this thumb in the feeling of that thumb? Can you get the sensation from both of them? Because in fact, the sensation will meet, and you can't tell which thumb is touching the other thumb and the feelings that it has. So you've got two thumbs touching each other. Can you feel the sensations in each one of them, or is it kind of merged together in a kind of a vague sort of way?

**Speaker B:** It's pretty merged.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. So we can do things like rubbing it like this, because then this thumb will feel that kind of sensation, and Does the other thumb that's doing the rubbing, does it have sensation also? So you can begin to feel, and this is really marvelous, because there's a— going back to this one, let us see if we can get it just right. Notice that the fingers are not touching each other. The thumb and the finger are not touching, not yet.

**Speaker B:** I can't actually see.

**Speaker A:** How close can they come without touching before they feel each other? This is actually a way of developing psychic power, that if you're in the body and experiencing the body, then people are not going to be able to sneak up on you at all. If we're paying attention to the body, that in fact one of the stories is well known is that let us say in the city, someone's walking down the street and then they know that they're being followed. Other times people will have a thief sneak up on them and they're not aware of it, but the hair on the back of their neck will stand up because the body is aware that somebody is there. But the mind is not aware because the mind is lost in thought. Rather than being in sensual awareness. So that's one of the qualities of someone who is really advanced in the techniques of the Buddha, is you cannot sneak up on them. You can't surprise them. They don't have a startle reaction because they're never startled. And the reason for that is because they're aware of the sensory input from around them. And the way that we can develop that is going back to that point that I'm talking about, is when do the fingers— how close do they have to be before they're aware of each other? That in fact, right now at this distance, the thumb can feel the index finger, but the index finger is buzzing and tingling right now because of that thumb being close. And I can move it back away, and now that buzzing and tingling in that index finger goes away. But I can bring it back, and there it goes again. They're not even touching. I don't have to touch each other in order to feel the sensation. So you can begin to play with this.

**Speaker B:** I'm gonna have to watch the recording for that.

**Speaker A:** I'm saying— sorry, what?

**Speaker B:** Uh, nothing. Uh, keep going.

**Speaker A:** Do you— what are you doing with your right hand right now? You stopped doing it immediately as soon as I mentioned it, huh? Okay. But in fact, that's one of the things that you do as a habit, is that you play, you twirl your hair. A lot of girls do that. All right. Um, then in fact, uh, the psychologists say that when a girl is playing with her hair, that she likes the guy. So that's not necessarily the case. What it really means is, is that the girl is paying attention to something on the outside, and then the instinctive habit of playing with and fidgeting comes up. That when we're paying attention to what the hands are doing, they don't fidget. But when we're not paying attention to the hands, the old habits will come back and the hands will begin to fidget again. Fidgeting in the sense of playing with the hair, playing with the face, rubbing the arms, all kinds of postures that happen, what we call subconsciously. Well, they're not subconscious, they are conscious. We're just not paying attention to them.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think you did mention that at one point, that it's good to start paying attention to what the hands are doing. Like, that can actually be a part of the practice for waking up to bodily awareness.

**Speaker A:** Yes. So start paying attention to the body, that if in fact you are paying attention to the body, one of the things that will begin to notice in the body is the effects of the mind. That the mind affects the body. An example of that is, is that when we get uptight or afraid, the body will get uptight. Literally, being uptight is not necessarily a mental situation, it's a physical situation that we get tense.

**Speaker B:** When you mentioned that, I actually noticed, I was like, oh, my spine is actually in a position where it's not like relaxed right now. Like it actually is kind of tense right now.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] In fact, you're making a point now that's important, because you're actually kind of quoting right out of the Anapanasati Sutta, that the main reason why we're paying attention to the body so closely is so we can find the tensions in it and relax.

**Speaker B:** Thighs.

**Speaker A:** So an example of that would be a feeling in the pit of the stomach. Okay, like a sense of loss, a sense of grief, sense of sadness is normally in the stomach area. And then anxiety is more up in the chest area. But in fact, I was wondering and giving ideas about why that was true. And now I know that it's physiological, that there is an area of the body called the spleen, and in that area it is actually a place of collection for blood to accumulate before it's pumped into the heart. For instance, where is— here's a good question to ask about this: does the body always have just the right amount of blood? Circulation, you know, some of us in the heart and some of us pumped into the brain and some of us go into various muscles and things like that. Or is there a possibility that the body actually has an excess amount of blood that it keeps in reserve so when we need it, it could be pumped?

**Speaker B:** Does it have excess blood?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, excess blood, maybe a half a pint or a pint of blood or whatever like that. For instance, if people always had just the right amount of blood, then we could not donate blood. But the fact is, is that we've had excess amount of blood, and normally that excess blood is accumulated close to the heart, in the chest and the spleen area, ready to go right into the heart. Which means that if the body has too much adrenaline in the blood, then you're going to be able to feel that as a sensation in the body that we will call tension, anxiety, restlessness. So the body actually has these components to that that's associated with our mental state. And if we can check and see that that's there. One of the ways of relieving that tension is by changing the thoughts that we have that is creating that adrenaline. But a much quicker way to deal with it is by breathing it out. Breathing in, taking in oxygen, and then breathing out that carbon dioxide, breathing out all of those excess molecules. And let that heavy tension in the blood that's accumulated in the chest disperse. And this is— we can go around doing any place, anytime. We can be driving the car and feel like that tension, so we can begin to take a few deep breaths while we're driving.

**Speaker B:** Oh wow, even while I'm like walking.

**Speaker A:** I could— even when we're walking. When we're sitting in class, a lot of kids in class get dull. If you recognize that the body and the mind are getting dull, take a few breaths, sit up straight, start paying attention to what the teacher is saying. Because most of the kids are not paying much attention to the teachers, that's why so many teachers get really animated and jumping around the room and yelling at the students or whatever like that, is to wake them up. And get them into the present moment. But you as a student, you can begin to do that on your own. You can remember that you can sit up straight, pay attention, listen to what's going on, and not get into that dull kind of state. And that dull state is normally because the kids are thinking about, "I wish I weren't here in class. Wow, it would be really great if I was out at McDonald's, or maybe it would be good if I was sitting in the pasture under the tree." or someplace like that. And so we have the idea, "I want out of here," but the student is not capable of getting up and walking out. So he's got this kind of duality going on: the mind is outside the classroom, but his body is there in the classroom. Can we bring the mind into the classroom where the body is? The answer to that is yes, this is a skill to be developed by starting to pay attention to the body. And his senses. All of the senses of humanity is located in the body. For instance, your actual eyes are not in the mind, they're actually on your face. Okay, so the physical point about the eyes, that's also true about the body. Here's something that's really interesting that the scientists have figured out. Is there are more neurons on your fingertip than there are in your eyes. And that in fact, they've been experimenting over time with this, that they can teach the blind how to see by putting, let us say, warming LEDs in an array on their back. That they would first start with an array of 16 by 16. That would be 250 little dots around like this. And then you can take a camera and put it through the hardware so that the image is a very rough image, a crude image. But you can begin to see that just by feeling the sensations on your back. After we get that, then they'll start doing something like maybe 250 by 250. And that gives even more discretion. And so blind people actually can learn to see if they can buy this very expensive equipment. Because why? Because the body has these neurons all over it. And so some professions actually call for and require that the hands can see. An example of that would be the mechanic is working under the dashboard of a car, and he can't put his head up there, he can't see what that stuff is, he has to feel his way around, he has to be able to feel, are we getting this screw in right, are we cross-threading it? Or can we get it to actually turn? We can feel that tension, we can feel the screw, we can feel the hole that we're going to put it in and all of that kind of stuff, and put that screw in and never ever see what's going on with the eyes. But we see clearly what's going on with the fingers. This is the training. Okay, then in fact, some seamstresses can get so good that they can thread a needle by feeling. Most people are looking like that, and most people can't even do it that way. They want a little metal spring to put through it and then put the thread through that, and then yank it through. So there's little assistance, but a really, really good seamstress can thread that needle without even looking at it. Why? Because she's really in tune with her hands. There's a lot of profession that gets us in tune with our hands. Music is like that. Can— here's the point: when a person is playing a very complicated piece of music on the keyboard, it's the hands that are doing it, but the mind can't even think about all of those notes, one note at a time. That is built right into the hands. And yet you haven't had much training in any of those kinds of skills. It's time for you to start training yourself. The training would be, can you feel each other? Do they have to actually touch before you can have the sensation, or can you feel it at a distance? Can you make sure that you know where your hands are? And one of the rules that you would have is the hands don't come above the shoulders, that you keep your hands, and the only time that they're raised above the shoulders is when you are intentionally noticing that, like for instance reaching up for something on the shelf, or raising your hand in class, or other times like that. Other than that, we keep the hands down. That there is an expression called akimbo, that when people are swinging their arms and walking, and the monks are trained to not do that. When you're walking, you hold your arms and your hands still. And in fact, that's part of the quality of the yam bag. Ajahn Po actually, as part of the training, you see, there's a bag that has a wide kind of a handle on it. And some monks will put it on the shoulder, like it was shoulder bag. But Ajahn Po would not allow that. He says, "Oh no, you have to hold that bag on your forearm, and you have to keep your forearm up to hold that bag, that that's the right way to carry." And so there's a lot of little trainings that the monks have that give this bodily awareness and that you can begin to train yourself that way too. Yeah, start watching what the body is doing.

**Speaker B:** Then I could be more aware of, like, because ultimately, is it like, like, I want to notice it so that I can kind of, like, isn't awareness kind of like the whole point of being awake is that we can see whether we're like what kind of state we're in and then make an improvement, right?

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** And that the body is yelling at us all the time and we're not paying much attention to it. There's sensations there on a regular basis. I would say there's probably 5 or 10 or— go ahead.

**Speaker B:** I could totally use it to wake up more.

**Speaker A:** That's exactly what I'm recommending, is start paying attention to the body, remembering to pay attention to the body. And that will be a very wakeful kind of thing to do, because with the body, it comes with the sensations of the body. The touch and the feel of the body will also put you in touch with your feelings of anxiety, the feelings of sadness, because those are also having bodily components. And with that, then, those two together will influence the mind. And so the mind will brighten up because we're paying attention. And with that comes more wholesome thoughts. So they start with the body, that influences the feeling, that influences the state of mind, which now influences the thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, thank you. Um, this is very, uh, this clear— this clears a lot of things up. Very eye-opening.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. Well, that gives you something to play with now. To be in the here now means to be in the body.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** When we're in the past, there's no body there. No body. Not a nobody, but a no physical body. That when we're in our remembrances, we rarely remember our own body. When you remember going to town, you don't remember your body sitting in the chair so much. But let us say that you're riding on a subway. When you're riding on that subway, you remember the subway, but you don't remember your body. And so years later, you could think about that railroad car that you were in, that carriage, but you don't remember your postures. You don't remember where you were standing. All you remember is your point of view. All right, but if you're actually paying attention to the body, that's always in the here-now. The body is here and it's giving off a huge amount of information, or let us say, making available a huge amount of information. We're not paying attention to it because we're too busy thinking about something else.

**Speaker B:** Makes sense.

**Speaker A:** So let's be here now, which means be in the body. Let's be here now, which means be with the breathing. Let's be here now in the sense of now we know that there's tension, if there's anxieties, if there's wants, if there are desires. Those show up and manifest in the body. And also, using the idea of the word pain, that in fact this is where people get to the point of not wanting to pay attention to the body because the body for them is a source of pain, itching, bumps, dull feelings, sharp feelings, chronic pain, acute pain, all these kinds of pains. And so we don't want to pay attention to the body because we see it as a source of pain. A much better attitude to have, and it'll take a while to develop that attitude as a skill, is to see the body as a messenger, that the sensations are messages and that we don't like the messages, then we'll call it pain. But you can have a sharp, acute sensation and know it, but you don't have to hate it. You don't have to not like it. You can accept it as this is what the body is doing. Now, normally what happens is that there's been a real injury, that the best way for that injury to heal is by keeping that area of the body still. An example is, if the athlete breaks his— not breaks his leg, but let us say has a knee injury, then the thing that the sport medical doctor will actually get him a knee brace. And what that brace does is, it braces that knee into a particular position, to let it heal. So long as that athlete is jumping around and moving that knee, it's not going to heal very well. It needs to be kept still. And if the athlete was paying more attention to what his knee was doing, he would hold it still. But he gets interested in playing the sport and doing all kinds of other stuff. An example of that would be— and I'm talking about the knee because I've had some knee trouble. And so the intention is to keep the knee, keep the leg straight, and don't bend the knee. But then Lucky got in the bed one day, and I let her just lay there, and then it was time for me to move. And instead of paying close attention to the knee, I moved it in a way that caused great pain. That was what the knee was saying, was don't do that. That's what real pain is, is a message saying, listen to me, don't do that. If you've got a broken leg, don't stand on it. Another example is that if the arm is broken, it's best to keep the hand still, because if the hand is moving, it actually moves muscles. In the arm. So if the arm is broken, that's why they put the arm in the cast, is to immobilize it, to keep it still. That if the, uh, if the kid does not get the broken arm set, it will deform. It will heal slowly, it will heal eventually, it will heal with a great deal of pain, but it will not heal correctly. So they put it into a cast. And so now the kid's got a cast on his hand, on his arm. He doesn't like it at all because he wants to pick up his coffee cup, he wants to pick up a glass, he wants to pick up and write with his pen or pencil, he's got to take notes in class. And by doing that hand movement, it slows the arm down and it will give him pain. And the pain is, don't use your hand. Now, it's very hard to teach a kid to hold his arm still, hold his hand still. So one of the techniques that medical people have learned to do is to make the kid put a sock on his hand. If you put a sock on your hand, that will help you to remember every time you want to use the hand, to not use it, because you've got a sock on it, you can't use the hand very much anyway, and that will help the arm heal, is by putting a sock on the hand. Which gives me the idea that maybe you can play with that as an experiment for yourself, is to go take a pair of socks. Instead of putting them on your feet, put one on each hand and go around that way all day, on maybe even to school. Just go around with socks on your hand, because that will make you pay attention to what the hands are doing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it would be pretty bizarre, so it would pull my attention pretty quickly.

**Speaker A:** And so if one of the girls asks you, well, why do you have socks on your hand, you can say, is to keep me from playing with my hair. I'll remember to not play with my hair when the socks is— because it's really hard to play with your hair when you got sock on your hand. Uh, now that's not a— that's not a regular thing to do. I would say that it'd only be regular in the sense of a couple of weeks when the guy has gotten his arm broken and having socks on his hands to prevent the hands from being used. But you can play with this as an experiment, maybe do it for an hour a week or something like that. Maybe 10 or 15 minutes at a time, because after you take the sock off, you're still going to be very, very aware of your hands.

**Speaker B:** Now, okay, I'm glad you cleared this up, especially because before I was hearing investigation, I was like, what kind of— like, uh, I wasn't sure what kind of investigation it was. But, uh, paying attention to the body and the thoughts, that's, that's plenty to work with. For sure.

**Speaker A:** All right, so you were asking, well, what do you do? Well, we're not going to be sitting in meditation 14 hours a day, but we can still be in a state of awareness much of the day by beginning to play with these techniques, to start watching what the hands are doing, slow the movement of the hands down. But in fact, here's an example of what we're talking about. Say the guy gets home and now he's got the urge to go to the toilet, so he quickly unlocks the door, he sets his keys down, and he goes to the toilet because that's what he's got on his mind. After he finishes the toilet duties, guess what? He doesn't know where the keys are. He set the keys down absent-mindedly. He wasn't thinking about the keys, he wasn't thinking about the hands, he was thinking about getting into the toilet, and because of that, he wasn't in the present moment. So he sets the keys down someplace, he goes back to look, and they're not where he thought they were. And he has to look and look for the keys, for in fact, if he had been mindful of setting the keys down in the first place, he would have remembered where the keys were. Okay, so this is a mindfulness training exercise of being able to train the body with the mind to pay attention to what the body is doing. What kind of posture you're sitting in? The Buddha recommends to sit up, sit up straight, because if we're bent over, then it's either got a mood thing to it, like for instance, when people are bored, they'll do this. But if you take it straightened back up, you can get rid of that boredom and start paying attention. So the body is an important element that we don't pay attention to in the practice of meditation. We think it's all mental, but the Buddha was very specific. That he starts out with the body, to examine the body, to understand the body, to know the body, and to relax the body. And so in the Satipatthana Sutta, it talks about reaching, touching, grabbing, become aware of all of those movements of the hands. And an easy way to help you do that is by putting a sock on the hands. Wow, that really will do it. Makes you very alert.

**Speaker B:** I'll give it a shot, because you recommend it, I'll give it a shot sometime.

**Speaker A:** All right, yeah, play with that sometimes. So this is how you make a new part of your practices, by instead of just thinking that it's all a mental exercise, it's a combination of mental and physical. It's a combination of paying attention to the body Because the body will wake you up to pay attention to your feelings. Your feelings will wake you up to pay attention to your state of mind.

**Speaker B:** And then once we— I guess once we do that, we can kind of choose to be happy, huh? Maybe.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Optimistic.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, we can be optimistic. Absolutely. Yeah, we can do this. Have the feeling of success, that I can take care of the body, I don't have to ignore it. It's not a source of pain, the body is a source of pleasure, being alive. Whenever people are feeling really, really good, they're moving their body a lot, they dance, they sing, they whoop and holler and move around. Because they're alive. And when we feel bad— their body—.

**Speaker B:** And they're having fun with all the sensations of what they've been given.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. But when we are sad, when we're remorse, when we're having a pity party, we tend to stoop, we tend to shrink, we tend to not pay attention to what the body is doing at all because we're too busy feeling bad mentally. So yeah, become alive, become vibrantly alive. Taking that deep breath feels really good. Begin to enjoy your body, pay attention to it, give it the service that it needs and deserves.

**Speaker B:** There was.

**Speaker A:** Good, good catch.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. Have a wonderful day.

**Speaker A:** All right, you go have fun. You go play with this thing. All right, we'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** See you later.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) in conversation with Avery (Speaker B), focuses on practical strategies for transforming the mind by working with thoughts and bodily awareness. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: Transforming Unwholesome Thoughts**
*   The discussion begins with how to handle unwholesome thoughts (e.g., anxiety, worry, self-criticism).
*   **Two-Step Method from the Buddha:**
    1.  **The "Peg" Method (For Beginners):** Replace an unwholesome thought with a wholesome one, like using a smaller peg to drive out a larger one. For example, when criticized, consciously think something grateful or neutral instead of reacting defensively.
    2.  **Seeing the Danger (Advanced):** Recognize the immediate harm of unwholesome thoughts—how they create tension, anxiety, and dullness. Simply seeing this danger is itself a wholesome thought.

### **Shifting Focus: From Just Meditation to All-Day Awareness**
*   Avery asks what to do after calming the mind. Dhammarato clarifies that the goal isn't just formal sitting meditation, but continuous mindfulness throughout daily life.
*   He emphasizes that many Westerners over-emphasize seated meditation, while the practice in the suttas and in Thai monasteries is about **"active meditation"**—remembering to be present in every moment.

### **The Central Practice: Waking Up to Bodily Awareness**
*   The primary tool for cultivating this all-day awareness is **paying attention to the body**.
*   **Why the Body?** The body is always in the present moment. Our senses (sight, sound, touch) are anchored in the body, unlike the mind which often dwells in the past or future (the "sixth sense").
*   **How to Practice:**
    *   **Start with the Hands:** Notice habitual fidgeting, touching your face, or playing with your hair. The simple intention to observe your hands brings you into the present.
    *   **Playful Exercises:** Try feeling the sensation between fingers without them touching, or wear socks on your hands for a short time to dramatically increase awareness of what your hands are doing.
    *   **Notice Posture & Tension:** Check if your spine is tense, your foot is tapping, or your shoulders are raised. These bodily states reflect your mental state (e.g., anxiety tightens the chest).
    *   **Use the Breath:** When you notice tension, take deep breaths to disperse it and relax the body.

### **The Purpose: Awareness Leads to Choice and Happiness**
*   The ultimate point of this bodily awareness is **to see your current state so you can improve it**.
    *   Body awareness reveals feelings (vedanā).
    *   Understanding feelings reveals the state of mind (citta).
    *   Understanding the mind allows you to cultivate wholesome thoughts.
*   By being present in the body, you break the cycle of dwelling on painful memories or future worries. You can then **choose** to gladden the mind, relax, and cultivate happiness.
*   The body should be seen not as a source of pain, but as a **vibrant messenger and a source of aliveness**. Enjoying bodily sensations is part of the path.

### **Key Takeaway for Practice**
Dhammarato gives Avery a clear, practical assignment: move beyond just working with thoughts and begin the foundational practice of **continuous bodily awareness**. By paying attention to the hands, posture, breath, and sensations throughout the day, one "wakes up" to the present moment, creating the conditions for calm, clarity, and wholesome mental states.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors** and **stories** to illustrate their teachings on mindfulness, dealing with unwholesome thoughts, and being present. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **Metaphors**

1. **The Carpenter’s Peg**  
   - **Context:** Explaining how to replace an unwholesome thought with a wholesome one.  
   - **Metaphor:** Just as a carpenter uses a new peg to drive out an old peg from a piece of wood, you can use a wholesome thought to “drive out” an unwholesome thought. The new peg must be the right size—not too big (too forceful) or too small (too weak)—symbolizing the Middle Way.  

2. **The Body as a Messenger**  
   - **Context:** Discussing bodily sensations and pain.  
   - **Metaphor:** The body is not just a source of pain but a “messenger.” Sensations (even pain) are messages about our state; we shouldn’t ignore or hate them but listen and respond skillfully.  

3. **The Sock on the Hand**  
   - **Context:** Encouraging mindfulness of bodily movements.  
   - **Metaphor:** Putting a sock on your hand is like a training tool—it makes you acutely aware of what your hands are doing, just as a cast or sock reminds someone with an injury not to use that limb. It’s a playful way to cultivate mindfulness.  

4. **Fingers Sensing Each Other Without Touching**  
   - **Context:** Demonstrating subtle bodily awareness.  
   - **Metaphor:** Bringing fingers close without touching to feel the “buzzing or tingling” illustrates how we can develop sensitivity to subtle sensations—a way to “wake up” to present-moment experience and even develop “psychic power” (heightened awareness).  

5. **Blood as a Reservoir for Emotions**  
   - **Context:** Explaining where anxiety or tension manifests physically.  
   - **Metaphor:** Excess blood in the chest/spleen area, filled with adrenaline, is like a reserve that creates physical tension when we’re stressed. Breathing out helps disperse it, like releasing pressure.  

---

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1. **The Thai Abbot and Western Meditators**  
   - **Story:** A Thai abbot notices Western visitors are obsessed with sitting meditation, while Thai monks practice mindfulness actively throughout the day (e.g., walking, chanting, daily tasks). This highlights that mindfulness isn’t just about formal sitting but about being present in all activities.  

2. **The Broken Cup**  
   - **Story:** A favorite cup breaks. When we remember it later, the memory isn’t “real”—only the present moment is real. This illustrates the teaching that dwelling on the past (or future) takes us away from reality now.  

3. **The Mechanic and the Seamstress**  
   - **Story:** A mechanic works under a car dashboard without seeing, using only touch. A skilled seamstress can thread a needle without looking. These examples show how professions train people to be exquisitely aware of their hands and senses—a model for mindfulness practice.  

4. **The Lost Keys**  
   - **Story:** Someone comes home urgently needing the toilet, sets down keys absentmindedly, and later can’t find them. This illustrates how lack of mindfulness in simple actions (like setting down keys) leads to forgetfulness and frustration.  

5. **The Injured Knee**  
   - **Story:** The speaker shares a personal experience of knee pain, moving it carelessly, and causing sharp pain. This reinforces the idea that pain is a message (“don’t do that!”) and that mindful attention helps avoid re-injury.  

6. **The Student in Class**  
   - **Story:** Students get dull in class because their minds wander (e.g., thinking about McDonald’s). By bringing attention back to the body (sitting straight, listening), they can wake up and be present.  

---

### **Key Themes Illustrated Through Metaphors/Stories**
- **Replacing Thoughts:** The peg metaphor.  
- **Mindfulness in Daily Life:** The Thai abbot, lost keys, sock on hand.  
- **Bodily Awareness:** Fingers sensing, mechanic/seamstress stories, injured knee.  
- **Pain as Information:** Body as messenger, knee injury story.  
- **Present-Moment Reality:** Broken cup story.  

These metaphors and stories make abstract Buddhist concepts (like *anapanasati*, *satipatthana*, *dukkha*) tangible and practical for the listener.
