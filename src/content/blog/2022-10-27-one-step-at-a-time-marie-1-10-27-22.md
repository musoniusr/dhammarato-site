### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Oh, okay.

**Speaker B:** Ah, yes. So anyway, I'm very, very happy to make you as a new friend.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. I'm very happy to see you live because I've listened to hours of podcasts and YouTubes, and I'm like, oh, I like this guy. It's simple. It's a relief. It's like, finally I understand, and I think I can, with diligent practice, I can do it.

**Speaker B:** You have heard of the Chinese proverb that a journey of a thousand miles begins with one step?

**Speaker A:** Yep.

**Speaker B:** So here I am, I've taken a step. Now what do we do? Well, the rest of the thousand-mile journey begins with just one step. All you have to do is just take one step, one step at a time. That one step, by the way, is defined as one's right effort. One's right noble effort is to take a step. Hopefully in the right direction.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Yeah, I've been all over the place. It's time to come back home.

**Speaker B:** Don't— you're thinking about a wide range of time. Oh yeah, some places like that.

**Speaker A:** All kinds of— about right this very moment. Yep.

**Speaker B:** That's what we— now that's where it all— and in fact, that's what makes it hard and difficult. Difficult and whatever for people to understand and practice, is because we got this wide impression, big, big world out there, big, wide, not at all wonderful world we live in. And what we fail to understand is that when we talk like that and think like that, that's merely just a little concept in the mind. Our big, wide, wonderful world is merely just a concept, okay? That the real world is that which you can sense with your senses— your eyes, your ears, your nose, your taste. That's all real. And here we are thinking about a big, wide, wonderful world which is just merely a concept that we've got in the mind.

**Speaker A:** Yep.

**Speaker B:** And when we recognize that, we can start spending a whole lot of time in the real world senses, a whole lot less time in the world of invention.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so our world actually is quite small. I can only see about 100 meters.

**Speaker A:** Oh, I see less than that. I see my wall. I see you and the wall and curtains.

**Speaker B:** So right now, your whole world is within those four walls.

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker B:** But if you start thinking about something dangerous that's outside of those four walls, then you'll fear fear, where the reality is within those four walls you're actually quite safe. The reality is, is that you're safe, but you can imagine all kinds of things that'll bring fear.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** So the right thing to do then is to not think about those things, but think about what's real.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's— yeah, easier said than done.

**Speaker B:** No, it's easy.

**Speaker A:** It's easy, but then I go— you.

**Speaker B:** Just set a rule, oh, I've got to do this all the time. Yeah, and I'm only asking you to do it right now.

**Speaker A:** So if I think that I want to do it all the time, not.

**Speaker B:** In the now, Well, when I think that I want to do it all the time, I'm living in a fantasy world. I'm living in a, uh, a constructed concept of all the time doesn't exist. Only right now exists.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** January 1st at 12 o'clock, 1850 existed, but when it existed, it existed as a noun.

**Speaker A:** True.

**Speaker B:** Everything is just right now, and that makes it so simple. You don't have to care.

**Speaker A:** Almost too simple. Exactly. It's so simple that it's just— and then the mind wants to go grab something. And you need to— Sati, you need to bring it back, and there it goes again, and then you do it back, and then—.

**Speaker B:** Well, you just indicated to me that you didn't like that.

**Speaker A:** No, I don't like it. No, because I think that's the teaching. They always say the mind— well, that's the thing. Well, if you want to do Vipassana, it's okay, but if you want to do like Like the hardcore Jhana, when nothing moves, it's not okay. So yeah.

**Speaker B:** Uh, Jhana is not hardcore at all. It's the bushiest stuff there is. Everything falls apart. There's nothing to it. That's a joke, by the way.

**Speaker A:** Okay, nothing to it. Nothing to it.

**Speaker B:** Right. His practice is easy. It's Sunyata. It's empty. There's nothing to it.

**Speaker A:** Always Sunyata. Sunyata, Nibbana.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, that's because these words are high pollutant for you.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** And they're jokes for me. They're toys to play with. Okay, is nothing— doesn't mean anything at all except chill, baby, chill. Just chill out, okay? Don't make some magical Nibbana.

**Speaker A:** That's when you said that to all those other people, chill, bro. That's it. I need to call this guy. I love it. It makes sense.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, that's what it did in the time of the Buddha, except that the people in the time of the Buddha used the word Nibbana just that way. The problem is, is when Western Buddhism sees the word Nibbana in print, they don't quite understand what it is, and so they make it magical.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I've been into the magical a lot, and I Did not work, and it created lots of Dukkha because I wanted the magic.

**Speaker B:** And you didn't get it?

**Speaker A:** No, I did not get it. I want my money back.

**Speaker B:** So now we're going to learn to be, uh, uh, let us say, uh, satisfied. So just so sad, we're ecstatic with being satisfied. How ordinary can it get? This is so beautifully ordinary, we couldn't get any better than this. There's just absolutely nothing to it. But a lot of people don't practice that, because they haven't brought nothing to it in their own minds. So let's talk about, uh, this. You've gotten quite a lot of background, so I'm just going to tiptoe right through the Eightfold Noble Path for you. That's the teaching of the book. And unfortunately, Western Buddhism has almost kind of forgotten all about the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path. It's sort of like the way that it's taught is like Okay, someday you should remember this, because someday it's going to be on the test. You got to know what the noble truths are. Somebody's going to ask you someday, you better know what it is.

**Speaker A:** I'm going to fail the test because I find Buddhism has so many lists. Lists and lists and lists, and I'm just— I can't remember all. So here's your way.

**Speaker B:** And to understand that the lists are coming by looking through this window, and then you come look through this window, and you see that list of things, and you come look through this window and see that list of things. So Buddhism is like just a building with a lot of windows. And so you look at it this way. Then you get a list of things because that's what you can see in this way. And then you look through it this way and you get a whole long list of things. Then you look at it this way, a whole long list of things. And now you're confused because you think that all these lists of things are separate, but in fact it's the same place you're looking at. You're just looking at it from various directions. A clear example of that is the difference between the Satipatthana the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and the Five Aggregates, because they're the same thing. It's exactly the same thing, except that with the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, we're looking at the whole show, including the mind and the mind's objects. Imagine that the Four Noble Truths— excuse me, the Four Anapanasati Patana is like an old wood pot-bellied stove, cast iron. You've seen them, you've got them in Montreal. Okay, so you've got the— you've got the pot-bellied stove, and then you've got the wood and the kindling. Okay, and when the spark is set off, the fire comes. And after the fire, you get two properties: smoke and heat. And a third one, the ash. Okay, so the body, your human body, is the pot-bellied stove. You and I both qualify. And then the wood is our feelings. That's where all the energy, all the consuming all of that coming. And then the mind is the fire. But with the mind burning the fuel of the feelings, we wind up with smoke and heat and ash, and that's the content of the mind. Okay, so that's one of the ways of looking at the Satipatthana, and that's the way actually we practice Anapanasati. We're going to be focusing on the smoke and the ash, or we're going to take care of the heat? That's why we put this thing in there anyway. Okay, let's look, let's use some wholesome stuff rather than looking at all the smoke and all the ash that we create. So, um, we look now at the five aggregates in the sense where we've already got the body and we've already got the feelings, but we're not so much of looking at the smoke and the ash and the heat. But we're looking at this fire. What is the fire? What components does it have? And the components that it has is consciousness, or Vinaya, Sanya, which is perception. So we are conscious of something, then we make a decision or a choice about it, and that we come up then with a new conclusion. But we don't get things just like that. We go off into another thing like memory. It has feelings and all kinds of other stuff built into it. And so when we become conscious of something, what we actually take in is not the actual object.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so do you want me to stop at the The Vedana there, you.

**Speaker B:** Know, you just stop it all. I want you to understand that it's not complicated because the Four Noble— the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and the Five Aggregates are just the same thing.

**Speaker A:** It comes and it goes.

**Speaker B:** Well, I'm not even thinking about coming and going, but we're talking about you.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay, okay, yeah, okay, okay.

**Speaker B:** This window and you see the Five Aggregates.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay, get it. Okay, okay.

**Speaker B:** All right. And if you look at it from the perspective of the Five Aggregates, the whole point of the Five Aggregates is that there is no self there anywhere, that the self is actually in the smoke, the heat, and the ash. But the body, the feeling, and the minds have no self to it. There's no nut core of self. This is, uh, the story, uh, is with Nagarjuna and, uh, King Milinda. You know that story?

**Speaker A:** I— yeah, uh, I know the.

**Speaker B:** Uh— but he forgot to take the chariot apart. Yeah, okay, okay. And now all the chariot pieces are all over the place. Where's the chariot?

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Oh yeah, the chariot's in the human mind.

**Speaker B:** That's where the chariot is. It's not inherent in the wood.

**Speaker A:** In the wood, nor in the seat, nor in the— I don't know how to say that in English, but yeah.

**Speaker B:** Well, it's got a basket, it's got a ridgepole, and it's got an axle, and it's got wheels and things like that in a chariot.

**Speaker A:** We can put the same thing— it's so hard not to see the chariot.

**Speaker B:** But you recognize that the chariot is within your mind. It's not inherent in that wood.

**Speaker A:** But it goes fast.

**Speaker B:** Yes, and so do the five aggregates in that same way give us the impression that we actually exist too, just like the chariot exists. In fact, the chariot is not a chariot, it's just a collection of wood according to a human concept. But there is no inherent chariotness. We even get down to the point that there is no inherent water because that's just hydrogen and oxygen, except there's no inherent oxygen. There just happens to be 16 electrons rather than 1 running around. Okay, that's just the whole point, is, is that there is no inherentness even in a proton because it's got ups and down quarks, but there's nothing inherent about the quark. They're going now into string theory, and down the rabbit hole of nothingness we go. There's nothing to it, but we make something out of it. We make things heavy, but it's all done within the human mind. So is he friend or foe? That's in the mind. Is he like me or different than me? That's in the mind. Does he have the same religion or not? That's in the mind. We— there's so much of it in the mind. And one of the things that's in the mind like that is me. And actually, that's just part of the, the aggregate system. And so, that's actually the first fetter that we have to deal with, the first bondage is personality view.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Aricca] Oh, yeah.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] And so, by practicing the Eightfold Noble Path and Anapanasati, so we get the mind really sharp and fit for work, then we can immediately see This whole Buddha thing is just all one package. There's not much to it. And in fact, the five aggregates are nothing more than half of the teaching of Paticcasamuppada. Probably heard that word, dependent origination.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I'm actually reading the book of— was he a teacher of yours? Bhikkhu Buddhadasa? I have it. I'm reading it, Under the Bodhi Tree. Okay, yeah, all right, yeah.

**Speaker B:** So the entire teaching of the Paticcasamuppada then is nothing but a kind of a story about where the self comes from, because it's not there in the five aggregates inherently. And yet we use language as if it was, like, I feel bad, or I feel sad. Okay, so I am my feelings. Beginning to learn through Anapanasati is that I'm not my feelings. I'm the observer of my feelings until I recognize, no, I'm not even the observer, but there is— that's where I am— observation.

**Speaker A:** The observer— who's the observer?

**Speaker B:** There is only merely observation. We don't need to have an observer, an entity, but there is observation. Yeah, what is it? What is the observation of? The observation, or the looking at the object. And the object here is now the feeling. So instead of saying I am sad, we can say there is sadness. There's no self in there. There is, is the recognition that there's sadness, and then the sadness itself. We say, I am sad, where in fact that's part of the delusion, just like I'm going out to the car, because it's a whole lot easier to use the concept of the car rather than I'm going to go open that metal door with the handle that's got the shiny stuff on it, and then I'm going to turn my butt around and sit down in this thing that they call a bucket seat. You know, we don't have to do all of that. We have a concept that puts all of these packaging pieces together so that it'll operate correctly, but there is no inherent car there. That's in the mind. Okay, another example of that— in fact, I use an example of an alarm clock quite often, though I don't have one.

**Speaker A:** Good, you're free.

**Speaker B:** Years and years ago, I had one when I was a really little kid. I used the alarm part of it as a toy machine gun, but I really knew, you know, but this is what 3-year-olds do. Okay, but the point of this clock is, is that it is— there's no clock there. The clockness there's no inherent clockness, that in fact what this thing is, is it's a collection of gears and wheels and springs and things like that, and jewels, etc., that we have. But then we recognize, no, there's no gears, that's just still a concept, but this is merely just metal arranged in a certain way. Then we go a little deeper and say, "No, even metal is not correct." That in fact, this is brass and tin together, and tin is this, and copper is this— sorry, not tin, brass is a mixture of copper and tin, as opposed to bronze, which has other stuff mixed in it. But the point is, is that we could keep going down levels and levels and recognize that what the human mind does is that collection collects things up to the point of collecting a car, collecting a house, collecting a me. We do that by wanting things. And we want things because we naturally like and dislike things. The liking and disliking is really built quite into our genes.

**Speaker A:** Is there something we can do about that? No. Now I can decide.

**Speaker B:** Let us say once you begin to understand it, you can begin to control it. All right. In Paticcasamuppada, we've already talked about perception and Samskara and consciousness giving rise to the Salyatana. Or the internal representation, or let us call it the internal consciousness. That's why it's called the 'salyatana'— that's the internal senses. So actually there's two ways then of talking about it. There's two different kinds of consciousness. One is, I can see it with the eye, or hear it with the ear. If I see it with the eye but I don't understand what it is, then I will process that based upon stuff I know from the past. And when I make stuff up from the past and put that into my understanding, I'll come up with something new that I understand. Except what we do unconsciously, or a better way to say it is ignorantly, is that when we're picking stuff out of the past in order to make sense of the present, we often bring feelings with us. So the feelings are built into the Samskara, so that once we make up our decision about this is what this is, the way that we're going to feel about it is almost built in. But that's not the place to begin, is down into perception. That's for the— let us say, when the skills are developed so that we can see that clearly that quickly, because this stuff happens in the mind really fast. But what we can see is how we feel, and we can see that that feeling leads to wanting, and the wanting then leads to the clinging. And I've got a new way of talking about clinging so that the students will get it immediately, and that is caring. What you care about causes you Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker B:** And in fact, there is a sutta by that name. Grief comes from those who are dear. It's in the 80s in the Majjhimanakkaya, I think it's number 87.

**Speaker A:** Not the animals, you mean?

**Speaker B:** Not the— Well, anybody. So if you've got a son and he badmouths his mom, storms out of the house, you feel bad because you care about him. Yeah, a stranger can do that to you and you can shake it off in 5 minutes, but when the son does that, you'll care for days. Yeah, suffer for days because you care.

**Speaker A:** I have a daughter, so I know. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so you know exactly what I.

**Speaker A:** Know exactly what you're talking.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so this is a good way of using that word caring. Is because we care, because we like and we don't like. So let's start working at that level of caring, because the caring is what takes us right into hell. Yeah, you know the steps of Paticcasamuppada. We're talking about the Vedana, the feelings. I don't like what she said. That goes into I want her to take it back. And now I really care about her now that she's not here. OK, so that's the Upadana, the Vedana, all done ignorantly, by the way. I don't like it, I want to change it, because I really care. And now that we really care, that is actually the Upadana and the Tanha, or the Tanha-Upadana sequence, is exactly the same sequence as the Baba Jati.

**Speaker A:** That you lost me.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so it goes Vedana, yeah, Tanha, Upadana, Bhavana, and then Jati, and then Dukkha. Okay, what is that? That means the birth of the self. Now a lot of translators will translate that word Jati into rebirth And that's okay if you understand it. But what we're talking about actually is the reappearance of the me that suffers. Think of the self as that which is the vehicle for carrying Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** If you have— sorry, it has nothing to do with reincarnation. And because I've heard like the three other teachers talk Talking about the three lives of the dependent origination.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Okay. So there are three lives in it, but it's not three lifetimes in the sense of three different human beings that are the same, three in one. I mean, we're back to Trinity now. That's pretty Christian of us, isn't it?

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** No, no, the three lives are there, the past The immediate past, present, and future.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And the immediate future, or the immediate present giving into the immediate future.

**Speaker A:** But it is not taught this way.

**Speaker B:** And when this all happens in 1 or 2 seconds, would you say it.

**Speaker A:** Was— it is not thought this way. It— I've— the way I've learned it is really like karma and 3 lives, like past life, this life, and then another. This is how I understand it anyway.

**Speaker B:** But I know that's the way that you were taught, and that's the way of the Vasudhi Marga.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** I'm really glad that you're open to what I'm saying rather than arguing with me.

**Speaker A:** No, I'm not.

**Speaker B:** I'm really pleased with that because I've got students that they really get into clinging to that kind of stuff, and they don't have near the depth of the knowledge of the teaching as you do.

**Speaker A:** Oh, thank you.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. So they just get off and running, all there is rebirth, and that's the teaching of the Buddha, to where no, in fact, the word rebirth is a later invention. That there was no word quite for it, but the word that we've been using historically would be the word reincarnation. And a lot of people don't know the distinction between the Buddha's rebirth and reincarnation. No matter how they want to define rebirth, they get it wrong. And a lot of people mistake rebirth and reincarnation and don't know the difference. They call themselves Buddhist. They talk about rebirth, this, that, and the other thing, but in their mind they're thinking about reincarnation. It's me that's reborn. The whole teaching of Paticcasamuppada is to teach, no, there is no self to be reborn without causes and conditions. And these are the causes and conditions. Starting even with consciousness have causes and conditions.

**Speaker A:** That makes sense this way. The other way never made sense to me. Well, never. I just couldn't get it.

**Speaker B:** Ah, but it's a delicious teaching. Oh, I'll live forever. I'll keep coming back. Oh, I'll have a redo. I'll get to do it again. And then that also feeds into, besides I'm a failure and I can't do it now, maybe let me make a little bit more merit, and then the next life it'll be easy enough for me to do. Reality is that this life is dead easy. You don't need to make it easier next time. You might not get a next time. That— all that stuff doesn't make sense.

**Speaker A:** And so I feel guilty because sometimes I think like that. When things go really, really bad and I cannot do this, I'm like, oh, maybe it's gonna get better in another life.

**Speaker B:** You were taught that?

**Speaker A:** Oh, it's comfy when things go bad. When things are perfect, well, we don't need that. But when things are really bad, yeah, right.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's the whole point then. You just nailed it. That's an excellent point, that that whole belief system is a consolation prize for losers.

**Speaker A:** It's true.

**Speaker B:** At least I'll get reborn. This life is terrible, but next time maybe it'll be a little bit better. So it's got hope and future and all of that, and guilty feelings for having had such a bad day today. It must have been something that happened in the past, but gosh, I don't I don't know why. Not recognizing, no, today's a bad day because you're making it a bad day today. And you really know how to make it a bad day today because you've done that before.

**Speaker A:** It's like the two arrows, like the Buddha said, that if you're stuck by an arrow thinking about what's this arrow made of, what's this arrow, where did, who shot the That arrow, it's what we do when it's bad. We're making stuff in our own mind. Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** So let's— we have actually now covered as much detail as we need to understand the teaching of Paticcasamuppada. Let's figure out where or what to do now. And so One of the ways that we can understand it is by hearing this: you've probably heard that the mind is the forerunner. What do we mean by that? Well, the old Brahmins had the idea that if you do an actual deed, that's like writing something, chiseling it in; that if you say something, that's like writing it on a piece of paper, writing it into the sand, it'll be there for a while but it'll fall away. And then a thought is like writing it in the water or in the air, that it's gone before you finish writing it. Okay, and the Buddha says, no, that's not the case at all. The reality is that the mind is the forerunner. Mind creates our reality. So the way that we can say it— this, by the way, is Taoist, but it's exactly Buddhist teaching also, and that is: the mind or the thought gives rise to our speech, our speech gives rise to our actions, our actions give rise to our habits, and our habits give rise to our destiny. So if we walk our thoughts, we can realign our destiny. We can change that. By changing our thoughts, we can change our habits, we can change our feelings, we can change our everything. It can be changed. We're not fixed. And that's the old idea of a self is something that's fixed, it's immutable, it can't be changed, it's so strong it'll survive death, all of that kind of stuff. But somehow or another, it is still subject to outside influence. Because when I get to heaven, God's going to kick me in the ass like a football, especially after the things I have to say to him. Hey man, what about these flies? What did you do with COVID Okay, so that whole mentality is based upon the fear that the self is not all of that immutable, powerful, and capable of sustaining death. We feel the self as weak. That's the whole idea of being a victim, that we were born victims. We had to be taken care of, we couldn't feed ourselves, we couldn't change our diapers, we couldn't talk, We were completely victims, and if we did not get nourished, we died. Somewhere around the age of 3 or 4, we stopped getting nourished and started getting ordered around: "Do your homework, clean up your room, clean that dog poo," on and on and on and on. And so we fall into that, and so we move from one kind of victim, that is nourished into another kind of victim that now is being criticized, Anicca, and so we pick up all of those habits, including the loss of feeling nurtured. So we lose feeling nurtured and we wind up with the bad rap of criticism and we learn that very well, and now we're critical of ourselves when we could be nurturing ourselves instead. And yeah, and we are critical, and we've got 10,000 laws to keep. And if you don't keep one, one of them, you're going to feel bad. We're going to punish ourselves for not meeting up to the standards. So then we go to Buddhism and find even higher standards that we can't meet up to, and boy, we really feel bad now. But when we begin to understand actually the Buddhist teaching of the Buddha has to do with waking up, being in the present moment, really understand by investigation what's happening right now, then we can just chill. We can relax the body. We can enjoy the moment because it's actually safe. The dangers is in our mind, just like the chariot or the me. And we can remove those unwholesome thoughts and have some wholesome thoughts instead. Like, wow, this is nice. No place to go. This is the gladdening of the mind that is stepped here in Anapanasati. And a little of it is in the Satipatthana. That in fact in the Satipatthana they have quite a long section about the hindrances and their removal. But a lot of people who teach a lot of different meditations, they fail to talk about that removal of the hindrances is the very first thing that must be done. Which is also what Bhikkhu Buddhadasa says in one of his books on Anapanasati, that gladdening the mind is the first thing that needs to be done, and this is the same thing. Removing those hindrances and brightening the mind, that's what needs to be done. And that's done with one's right effort. So to practice the Eightfold Path is to practice Anapanasati. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa even said, and got into a huge amount of trouble— this was so many years ago in the '30s, '40s, sometime like that— he says, Buddha only taught one kind of meditation, and boy was that a big stir.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I've read about that a little bit. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And then they figured out that yes, he was right, that there is no other sutta that gives anything about any kind of practice of meditation except in the Anapanasati Sutta when he's trying to convince those that are practicing the four brahmabhavanas and jhanas to stop doing that stuff and practice what we're doing here.

**Speaker A:** So instead, as a practical, for me, I should stop trying to reach those really high kind of— I cannot do that. These high Jhana where you shut every— where you cannot hear, you cannot see, you cannot feel. You, you don't even breathe. You're kind of like half dead, and all you see is the nimitta. You go into the nimitta and— oh, cannot do that. Why would you? Because I thought— because the way they teach it, I wanted— yeah, I thought that to, to Nibbana, you had to go all the way to those high Jhana. I thought it was the only way to—.

**Speaker B:** I know. I have heard Arhat Brahm is not the only one who speaks that way.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** One of the things that we could just automatically take note of probably know this from some place or another, that after the Buddha left home— never mind any of the stuff about him leaving home— did leave home, he took 5 people, I think, with him, including a horse trainer, Jhanda, and also Konda, his Brahman teacher who had already taught him Jhana.

**Speaker A:** And all— oh, I forgot all that one. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah, that's an interesting connection, isn't it? He was also the one when, uh, when baby Gautama, uh, Siddhartha was born, uh, they got several Brahmins to do their magic and give, uh, as many of them said, he's going to be a world Anagami. And Chanda was the one who says no, he is going to be an Arahant. Okay, and then he became his teacher right through into the Dhamma, excuse me, the first turning of the wheel, the.

**Speaker A:** Turning of the wheel, the turning of the wheel, right?

**Speaker B:** The Chakravartana Sutra. Got it, it came back.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** So in that sutta, that's where Jhana was the one who became a Srotapanna right there on the spot. He got the Four Noble Truths. That was the teaching of the Chakrapadana Sutta. So the point that I'm making is, is that before that, backing up into the 6 years that he spent with them out in the woods, he had 3 major teachers. One was Anagami, the other one was Ramana Putta, and the third one was, uh, uh, Nata Nata Putta, which is also known as Mahavira, the head of the Jains. The Jains, yeah, kinds of flagellations and all of that. And he's— he lost so much weight, became really skinny. They call it the Starving Buddha and all that. He wasn't a Buddha when he was starving.

**Speaker A:** No, he was a Buddha. He was a Bodhisattva, was it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's what he was, a Bodhisattva, a Buddha-to-be.

**Speaker B:** Okay. The one who was looking anyway.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So he also, before he went there with Anagami and Rana Rana Putta, where he was practicing Jhana.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, that's why I'm all confused. He did that before, so why are they teaching it? But I never had the chance to ask question also. That's also— you're the first one that I can really ask question because I'm always had to deal with books before. So that's why it's good to have the A teacher.

**Speaker B:** But I dealt with a few masters also.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, never had one.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, let's go then to the past, the time that he was dissatisfied with the jhanas, and so he practiced austerities and he got to be the very best. He almost killed himself.

**Speaker A:** Poor Piti.

**Speaker B:** And then he realized, no, coming out of there, that how can I become enlightened, or how can I achieve any distinction when I'm this bad off? I can't even get up out of the tree. And then the story of the rose apple. And by the way, if you're into suttas, this is in Sutta number 36. You know the story of the rose apple tree?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, when he was a young— you remember when he was a young during the festival of the spring, something like that, that he attained the first Jhana just like that. And he said, maybe this is the way to enlightenment.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so here you are talking about.

**Speaker A:** The fourth jhana when you are— No, the first jhana.

**Speaker B:** Wait a minute, you've been talking though about before about all the jhanas and all the emptiness and the stillness and shutting down and this, that, and the other thing. And here the Buddha is saying, no, the first jhana is And when you look at the Anapanasati Sutta, you will see the items of the first Jhana built into practice. Also in Sutra 111 in the Majjhima Nikaya, one by one as they occur, is when the Buddha talks about getting into the first Jhana and then taking various objects in the first Jhana. And as you're taking various objects, that creates the fourth Jhana, or whatever Jhana. So in fact, if you stop thinking about how good you feel and start experiencing how good you feel, that's the second Jhana. How good can you feel doesn't take any words. You need the words to get yourself up on that, uh, mountain, but you don't need the ladder once you're on top of the mountain. Don't need the words. So you let the words go, and there's a procedure that we can go through. Let the words go. So now you take the object, it's feelings. You don't have to say, 'I'm in second jhana.' You can just say, 'I'm just taking the object while I'm in first jhana of feelings. See, in the first jhana, what we take the object of is the applied and sustained thought. Can we keep applying? Can we keep sustaining? And when we've got one wholesome thought after another, after another, then we can go and take how good we feel as an object. Then we can take satisfaction as an object.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Satisfaction then is Sukkha.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** And that's the object of the third jhana.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Okay. And so then we take Upekkha or emptiness or whatever as the fourth jhana. And by the time we can get to there, we can actually see how the mind works. You can actually see perception in action. And you can treat it like a toy. That's why so much of that stuff is talking about perception, either perception or non-perception, and nothingness, and expansion of consciousness.

**Speaker A:** Those are the Arupa Jhanas. That, that is all weird to me. I understand until the fourth, but describing the— because they All these things, if.

**Speaker B:** You look at the way that the suttas are set up, it is Jhana number 1, Jhana number 2, and Jhana number 3, Jhana number 4. It's a long description for Jhana number 4. There are no 5s, 6s, 7s, or 8s in any sutta.

**Speaker A:** So that comes from the Visuddhimagga?

**Speaker B:** Probably comes from ignorant Westerners who like to count.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And in fact, if you count it correctly, in Sutra number 111, there's not 8 Jhanas, there's 9. Yes, 9 different states are talked about, and the last one in there is the end of perception, is the end of feelings. We stop perceiving, which means we just let data come in. We just let data come in. We just let it go.

**Speaker A:** We don't— to me, before, it was.

**Speaker B:** Kind of like sense out of it. We just let it in as a flood. We get completely into the senses. Stay at consciousness and let it become vast.

**Speaker A:** So this is the Nirodha Samadhi? Is this what you're trying to tell? The 9th step The Nirodha, Samadhi, the 9th step?

**Speaker B:** We're talking about most specifically getting completely into the senses, so that the senses become a flood. See, the way that we normally do is that we look at something, make sense out of it, look again, make sense out of it, look at it again, make sense out of it. Very, very much like a computer would take data input, process it against some database. Like you log into your website for the bank and you give them this, that, and the other number, and then they'll go into their database and pull up your amount. And it takes a bit of time for that processing to happen. Human mind does the same thing. While we're processing our data, we're missing out on a huge amount of input. If we stop processing, if we stop perceiving data and just let it be without any thoughts, without any— just take it in, without trying to figure out what's happening, you just let it in, then it becomes a flood, becomes a marvelous flood. You're in— and not only that, but the boundaries of the body break down. This is what they mean by— and by the way, it's a really poor description— by calling space. It's not infinite space, it's just spacious. Okay, it's not infinite consciousness, it's just full-on consciousness. Had translations done by people who didn't understand what they were reading in the Pali, and there's basically nothing to it. The real issue is the first Jhana. The first Jhana is 90 to 99% of all of the effort that you'll take to put in. And in fact, almost all of the effort that it takes is the first Jhana. Why is that? Because we have to learn to apply, sustain, apply, sustain, sustain, sustain, keep one wholesome thought after another wholesome thought after another wholesome thought. The way that we do that is by corralling the mind, by not allowing it to go into unwholesome thought. Then we pin it down to even a smaller area, and then down to another smaller area, perhaps all the way down to Mantra, the only actual thought you have is 'me' on the in-breath and 'to' on the out-breath. The mind is down to just two syllables, just one word over a long 5-10 second time period. Going down to zero is easy, but you've got 10,000 thoughts a minute going by, it's hard to slow it down to nothing, so we've got to do it through a procedure.

**Speaker A:** So how to do it? How are we going to do that in— into— you cannot do that in everyday life. You need to be doing this sitting down.

**Speaker B:** I'm not telling you to do it in everyday life, but there's that Western mentality of all the time again. All the time. Take that out and put in right now. Is the answer. Because yeah, you could sit on the bus and, and, uh, pay attention to what is happening inside the bus. You could be in an office and paying attention to what's happening inside that office. You could be in a car driving and pay attention to what you're doing. All automobile accidents anywhere in the world has happened because people are not paying attention to what's going on. That's a clear sign of Dukkha right there. We're talking about paying attention to what's going on, and you're saying, oh, I can't do that in daily life. And the answer to that is you'd be a whole lot better off if you would start paying attention to what's going on and start thinking about stuff.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Remember, there's nothing to this. You're trying to tell me that you have to be in Dukkha, in the world? The answer to that is, well, don't go there.

**Speaker A:** I guess it's the default state, Dukkha in the world.

**Speaker B:** That's right. That is the Samma Sanghappa of the Eightfold Noble Path, is what is our default state and can we change it? What is the default state for most victims? They're in the default state of 'I can't.' We're in the default state of 'This is hard.' We're in the default state of 'That's going to take so much work.' That's the default state of 'Oh, poor me, I can't do it.' That's our default state. What is the state that we're going to change it to? The state of being a winner, the state of being a champion, the state of 'I can do this,' the state of being a lion. Let's let out a roar together, okay? We're talking about attitude here. We have to have that can-do attitude, because if we have a can't-do attitude, then we can't. And if we have a can-do attitude, we can. And the real attitude, the real winner, is already done. It's not the job that needed to be done has already been done. All of that is done in the first Jhana. Don't need to hire Jhanas. They're natural occurrences.

**Speaker A:** I'm happy to hear that.

**Speaker B:** All you need to do is learn to be happy. Just keep getting yourself back happy. Accept your darkest nature, the worst part about you. If you criticize it, now you're in an unwholesome state of criticism. So sit around and think about the worst things about you.

**Speaker A:** Then another one, the thing that— well.

**Speaker B:** The whole point then is, is that you're not going to see these things as worse anymore. You're going to see them, they're okay. I'm all right. Just the way you are is just fine.

**Speaker A:** Wow.

**Speaker B:** You're already okay. There's no place to go and nothing to do. There's nothing to attain. That's the attitude that we're developing here. You've already got it.

**Speaker A:** This is something you just said, because we— I Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, see, you have been criticized into thinking that you're not good enough, and now you're striving to get up to— trying to get up to scratch. You have been working.

**Speaker A:** Well, I did not know. I, I was ignorant. I did not know. I was all confused. Now you give me kind of— Let's.

**Speaker B:** Be honest, you were lied to.

**Speaker A:** I did not know that I was lied to.

**Speaker B:** You've been lied to.

**Speaker A:** Okay, wow.

**Speaker B:** Lied to.

**Speaker A:** No wonder I couldn't do it.

**Speaker B:** Well, you know why they lied to you?

**Speaker A:** No.

**Speaker B:** They didn't know any better either. They were lied to.

**Speaker A:** But they seem to be able to do it, whoever they are.

**Speaker B:** You have to plow through the lies. You have to stop lying to yourself and start seeing things the way they are.

**Speaker A:** This is really hard to do, to see lies.

**Speaker B:** It's not hard. That's the victim within you. Cat.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, he's my cat. He's my cat. Hello.

**Speaker B:** Recognize when we say things that are hard, you see, you create your reality. The reality that you've created is that this is hard.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's why I stopped doing it. That's why I said I need to I need to talk to Dhammarato because I just, it's, it's, I was about to, I was about to throw up. I would just, whatever.

**Speaker B:** Tell yourself it's easy, tell yourself it's easy.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it's easy.

**Speaker B:** Tell yourself, hey, wow, this is easy, I can do that, I can sit down and do nothing. Okay. Start getting some success in your life.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, doing nothing, I can do it, but doing nothing without feeling guilty, Uh, sometimes, maybe Friday.

**Speaker B:** Hey, I see that guilt. I see you, guilt.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I see you.

**Speaker B:** I don't have to feel guilty right now. I can take a deep breath and do nothing and not feel guilty.

**Speaker A:** This is hard.

**Speaker B:** No, you just defeated yourself again. Instead of saying, well, you're talking about forever, it's hard. Well, let's not do it forever. Let's just do it right now.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay, you got a point.

**Speaker B:** At least one time, okay, relax and not feel guilty.

**Speaker A:** I do.

**Speaker B:** Okay, the question is, can you do it a second time now?

**Speaker A:** Yes, I can.

**Speaker B:** It works. You can do it again.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I can.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so that's the attitude it developing is that I could do it one time, that's enough skill to do it a second time, and another time maybe, or maybe just one after another after another. Instead of expecting something out of ourselves, we nurture ourselves that this is okay, this is good. Yeah, I've been thinking about killing that banker, but I'm not going to, so it's okay. Just let that thought go. But you, you're going to say, oh, I want to kill that back. Oh, I should not do that. Oh, poor me, I'm so guilty, you know. And you're all up front. Just, no, I can let that thought about killing— don't need that. Not going to do it anyway. And just accept. Nurture yourself instead of punishing yourself for your wrong. Accept your wrong. Look at it. And let it go. As the Buddha said someplace in some book, let it pass. Don't cling. Stop caring.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Don't care. Don't care about Jhanas.

**Speaker A:** Just enjoy what— No, not anymore. No. I'm sure now. Yes, it feels good to hear that. That's— yeah.

**Speaker B:** Does it even feel good to the fact that this is actually in the suttas? This is the teaching of the Buddha. The Visuddhimagga, that's from 450 to 500 AD.

**Speaker A:** I've tried to read it, and it's got politics.

**Speaker B:** I've got it right here.

**Speaker A:** Oh gosh, it's unreadable, but it's good for if you want to go to sleep. Oh, sorry.

**Speaker B:** About that. Um, it's got some interesting things in it. One of the things that is actually quite valuable is, 'There is walking but no walker be.' That's a good phrase out of it. It's got some really, really good stuff in it.

**Speaker A:** I was just joking. I was just making— but it's such.

**Speaker B:** A good book that it's got so many, many good things in it. I would say maybe about 5% of the book.

**Speaker A:** 5%?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, I mean, it's a big book.

**Speaker A:** It is huge. It is.

**Speaker B:** But there's about 99, 95% of the stuff in there is going to cause the students Dukkha Vajrayana.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I didn't read it all. I think I stopped at maybe half of it.

**Speaker B:** You were reading it backwards then. It's like, yeah, you have to read the last parts first.

**Speaker A:** No, the ends.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we were taught in school to start at the very beginning and read right through to the end, and that's not the way to read a book. Way to read a book like it was a dictionary, not a novel.

**Speaker A:** How does it end?

**Speaker B:** Huh?

**Speaker A:** How does it end?

**Speaker B:** That's the whole point, is it doesn't. Never ends.

**Speaker A:** The Visuddhimarga— you're looking for an— you're.

**Speaker B:** Looking for an ending, and the right way of looking at it is this moment's okay, and Whether we have another one or not is irrelevant. We don't care about what's the end of it, we just care about how it's happening right now.

**Speaker A:** Right now I'm having fun and I'm feeling relief speaking with you.

**Speaker B:** You have heard the phrase of good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end. And there's a little phrase after that, is about "with right phrasing and meaning." And what that actually means is that when the Dharma is taught correctly, in the proper order, then the student gets benefit right away. It's good in the beginning. There's also the simile of the snake. Where it talks about that you pick up the Dhamma by the wrong end and it's going to turn around and bite you, which is what happens with certain meditation. They wind up with more Dukkha than they had before. But if you practice correctly, it's going to be good right from the very beginning. What is that very, very beginning is change this thought into something awesome. Change this state of mind to something a little brighter, a little gladder than it is right now. That any thought that you have could be improved. And if it can't, then dang, congratulate yourself. You're at the top right now. But other than that, just any thought that we have can be improved. And when we get into the rhythm of one wholesome thought after another, we begin to watch that. Yes, I am applying the mind to the wholesome, and yes, I can sustain that. I can stay in the here now. I can appreciate what's happening in keep coming back and coming back and coming back and enjoying the heck out of nothing to do, place to go, safe, secure, comfortable, relaxed, satisfied, and successful. Okay, okay. You can see the first Jhana built right in. Remove the hindrances, get those unwholesome thoughts out of the mind, get some thoughts of feeling safe, secure, and comfortable. The body and the feelings— the body has to be safe and secure first. You've gotten yourself into the room, got yourself an easy chair. Now the body is safe and secure. Now we get the mind in the state of safe and secure by telling ourselves, "Look, you actually are safe and secure here." And with the safety and security now comes the satisfaction, and that satisfaction is the Sukkha of the first Jhana. And when we keep practicing that over and over and over and over again, we begin to recognize, "I can do this." A little bit later, "Hot dog, I can do this." And then the next one is, you know, it does not matter how obstructed the mind is getting, I can throw that stuff right out and come right back into a really good state. That's the confidence building. That's where the Piti comes from. Hot dog, I've got this wired! I can do this! That's part of the journey. Yep, that peak point of, wow, this feels so good. And we keep doing that over and over and over again. Every shampoo bottle tells you exactly how to do First Jhana. Every shampoo bottle.

**Speaker A:** Shampoo bottle?

**Speaker B:** The shampoo bottle, right there.

**Speaker A:** Let's go for this.

**Speaker B:** The last two words it has is rinse and repeat.

**Speaker A:** I will never ever have a shampoo the same again. I love it.

**Speaker B:** Rinse and repeat. That's what we're doing over and over and over again. That's the first Jhana, is rinse and repeat. Just keep cleaning the mind out, put it into wholesome state, and then do it again.

**Speaker A:** That's cool. I'm having a shower and there's Sati. I'm gonna think of the time.

**Speaker B:** Shower is a really good place to go into first Jhana. Just, oh, it feels so good.

**Speaker A:** Oh wow. Oh, thank you so much.

**Speaker B:** Well, I think that this is a good place for us to stop, even though we have been all over the map. Yeah, in one call. So that alone proves how small that map really is. There's really not that much. No. But there's— then the next part will be various applications in various situations and all of that kind of stuff that we can talk about later. Yeah, yeah. Right now I think that you've got the concept. You've already got a practice started, so now all you have to do is start gladdening that mind. Yeah, but throwing those unwholesome thoughts out.

**Speaker A:** And have a good night. Shampoo the mind.

**Speaker B:** Repeat. Exactly.

**Speaker A:** Perfect. Well, thank you very much for your time.

**Speaker B:** Hey, this has been delightful. I really enjoyed it.

**Speaker A:** Me too. I really, really enjoyed it. And I will talk soon.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I'll see you in about a week or so.

**Speaker A:** I'm sorry, a week?

**Speaker B:** See you in about a week or so.

**Speaker A:** Sure, I'll call back in a week.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Well, take care. Take care. Bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk between Dhammarato and a student is a practical, down-to-earth conversation that demystifies core Buddhist concepts and emphasizes a simple, accessible approach to practice. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Philosophy: Simplify and Be Present**
*   **Start with One Step:** The path begins with a single step of right effort, taken right now. Don't be overwhelmed by the idea of a long journey or perfect, constant practice.
*   **Live in the Real, Not the Conceptual:** Our "big, wide world" of worries and stories is just a concept in the mind. The real world is what we can sense *right now* (sight, sound, etc.). By focusing on the present sensory reality, we see we are often safe, while our fears are mental projections.
*   **"Chill Out" - Demystifying High Teachings:** Terms like *Nibbana*, *Sunyata* (emptiness), and *Jhana* are not magical or overly complex. They point to a state of ease, satisfaction, and "nothing to it." The problem arises when we intellectualize and glorify them, creating more *dukkha* (suffering).

### **Unifying the Buddhist Frameworks**
*   **All Lists are Windows to the Same Truth:** The many lists in Buddhism (Eightfold Path, Four Foundations of Mindfulness, Five Aggregates) are not separate systems. They are different windows for looking at the same reality—the mind-body process.
*   **Example - The Stove & The Chariot:**
    *   The **Five Aggregates** are like a stove: the body (stove), feelings (fuel), consciousness (fire), and mental formations/perceptions (smoke/heat/ash). The point is: there's no permanent "self" to be found in any of these parts.
    *   This is illustrated by the story of **King Milinda and the Chariot**: a chariot is just a concept we apply to a collection of parts (wheels, axle, etc.). Similarly, the "self" is a concept applied to the five aggregates, not an inherent thing.

### **Practical Application: The First Jhana is Key**
*   **Forget Complicated Jhanas:** The talk de-emphasizes striving for advanced, dissociative *jhanas* (like the formless realms). The historical Buddha found those insufficient and moved on.
*   **The First Jhana is Accessible & Essential:** The goal is the **first *jhana***, which is about cultivating a wholesome, gladdened mind in the present moment. It's built through:
    1.  **Gladdening the Mind / Removing Hindrances:** The first job is to remove unwholesome thoughts (worry, doubt, ill-will) and nurture wholesome ones (safety, comfort, satisfaction).
    2.  **"Rinse and Repeat":** Like the instructions on a shampoo bottle, the practice is a cycle: notice an unwholesome state, let it go ("rinse"), and gently bring the mind back to a gladdened state ("repeat"). This builds the "applied and sustained thought" of the first jhana.
    3.  **Cultivate a "Can-Do" Attitude:** Replace the default victim mentality ("I can't," "This is hard") with the attitude of a champion. Success comes from believing "I can do this right now."
*   **Anapanasati (Mindfulness of Breathing)** is the meditation method that encapsulates this entire process and the Eightfold Path.

### **Clarifying Key Doctrines**
*   **Dependent Origination (*Paticcasamuppada*):** This is not primarily about reincarnation over three lifetimes. It's a map of how *dukkha* arises **moment-to-moment**:
    *   Feeling (*vedana*) → Craving/Aversion (*tanha*) → Clinging/Caring (*upadana*) → Becoming (*bhava*) → **Birth of the Suffering Self (*jati*)** → *Dukkha*.
    *   **"Caring is Clinging":** We suffer because we *care* (cling) about things. Less caring = less suffering.
*   **Rebirth vs. Reincarnation:** The Buddha's teaching on rebirth is often confused with reincarnation (a self/soul moving to a new body). True Buddhist rebirth, explained by dependent origination, is the **momentary re-arising of the sense of "me"** that suffers. Belief in future-life rebirth can sometimes be a "consolation prize for losers," distracting from doing the work now.

### **Final, Empowering Message**
*   **You Are Already Okay:** The core of the teaching is to realize "there's no place to go and nothing to do." You are not a project to be fixed. The practice is about relaxing into and appreciating the present, not attaining something you lack.
*   **You Were Lied To (Out of Ignorance):** Many traditional teachings, influenced by later commentaries like the *Visuddhimagga*, over-complicate the path and set impossible standards, leading to guilt and frustration. The Buddha's original message, as found in the suttas, is simpler and more joyful.
*   **Practice Anywhere:** You don't need perfect conditions. Start right now, in daily life, by paying attention and gladdening your mind. Even a shower can be an opportunity for joyful presence.

**In essence,** the talk is a call to abandon complex, striving Buddhism and return to a simple, present-moment practice of nurturing a gladdened mind through continuous, gentle effort—"rinsing and repeating" your way to peace.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several key metaphors and stories to explain Buddhist concepts in a simple, relatable way. Here are the main ones:

### **Metaphors:**

1.  **The Journey of a Thousand Miles:** Used to illustrate that practice begins with a single step (right effort), and continues step-by-step.
2.  **The Four Walls:** Represents the immediate, sensed reality. Worrying about dangers outside the walls symbolizes how the mind creates fear through concepts, not present reality.
3.  **Windows on a Building:** Buddhism is likened to a building with many windows. Different lists (like the Five Aggregates or Four Foundations of Mindfulness) are just different views of the same reality, not separate things.
4.  **Pot-Bellied Stove:** A metaphor for the **Four Foundations of Mindfulness (Satipatthana)**:
    *   **Stove = Body**
    *   **Wood = Feelings** (the fuel)
    *   **Fire = Mind**
    *   **Smoke, Heat, Ash = Contents of the Mind** (thoughts, perceptions)
5.  **The Alarm Clock / Car:** Used to explain **Anatta (not-self)**. A clock is just a collection of gears and metal; a "car" is just a concept bundling together metal, seats, and handles. There's no inherent "clockness" or "carness," just as there is no inherent, permanent self.
6.  **Writing in Different Mediums:** Contrasts an old Brahmin view with the Buddha's teaching that **"mind is the forerunner."**
    *   Deeds = chiseled in stone.
    *   Speech = written in sand.
    *   Thoughts = written in water/air (gone instantly).
    *   **The Buddha's view:** Mind (thought) is the most powerful, giving rise to speech, action, habits, and destiny.
7.  **Shampoo Bottle Instructions - "Rinse and Repeat":** A modern, humorous metaphor for the core of **First Jhana** and meditation: continually cleansing the mind of unwholesome thoughts and returning to a wholesome, glad state.

### **Stories & Analogies:**

1.  **King Milinda and the Chariot (Nagarjuna):** The classic story deconstructing the self. When a chariot is taken apart, where is the "chariot"? It exists only as a concept in the mind. Similarly, the "self" is a concept applied to the Five Aggregates, not an inherent thing.
2.  **The Two Arrows:** Referenced by Speaker A. The first arrow is pain; the second arrow is our mental suffering (Dukkha) about the pain—the stories, blame, and worry we add.
3.  **The Buddha's Past Teachers and Asceticism:** The story of the Buddha studying Jhana with teachers like Alara Kalama, practicing severe austerities, and then realizing the **Middle Way** after remembering a childhood experience of **Jhana under the rose apple tree**. This is used to argue that natural, accessible Jhana (based on gladdening the mind) is the path, not extreme asceticism or forced, ultra-concentrated states.
4.  **The Simile of the Snake:** Referenced at the end. If you grasp the Dhamma incorrectly (by the wrong end), it will bite you (cause more suffering). If grasped correctly, it is beneficial from the very start.

### **Key Conceptual Metaphors:**

*   **"Chill, baby, chill" / "Chill out":** A recurring, informal metaphor for **Nibbana** and the goal—not a magical state, but one of relaxation, ease, and cessation of struggle.
*   **"Consolation prize for losers":** A blunt metaphor for the view of rebirth as a comfort for present-life suffering, which Dhammarato contrasts with addressing suffering **now**.
*   **"The victim" vs. "The lion / champion":** A contrast between the default mindset of helplessness and the "can-do" attitude of right effort. Practice is about moving from being a critic of oneself to a nurturer.
*   **"Good in the beginning, good in the middle, good in the end":** The hallmark of correctly taught Dhamma—it provides immediate benefit (gladdening the mind), not just a distant future goal.

In summary, the speaker uses **down-to-earth, modern metaphors** (shampoo, walls, windows) and **classical stories** (chariot, Buddha's life) to demystify core Buddhist teachings, emphasizing present-moment awareness, a non-magical understanding of enlightenment, and a simple, repeatable practice of cultivating a wholesome mind.
