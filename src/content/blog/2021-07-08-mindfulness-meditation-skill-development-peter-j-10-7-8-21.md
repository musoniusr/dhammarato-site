### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, Peter, good to see you again. It hasn't started counting. There we go. Okay, okay, Peter, good to see you again. And you've got a couple of questions. The first one is, once you establish your practice and get it going correctly What do you do after that? And that is that you continue to develop those particular skills. Okay. And as you develop the skills, the things that are worth noting will dwindle away because you're eliminating the new unwholesome things within the wholesome. An example of that is that once every thought is wholesome one after another, and that we verified that because we've done a long system of guarding and we know that one wholesome thought is coming after another, that's actually no guarantee that unwholesome thoughts will not arise in the future, because they probably will. And the whole quality of our practice is when they do arise, that we'll know it. And so now our practice is to still do the same thing, only now we're doing it at a slightly, let us say, more sophisticated and even quicker level. Quicker in the sense of both identifying what's going on faster, and also, let us say, noting what's going on faster. And then the second quality would be to make the determination, is this wholesome or not? So that things don't get in the mind and stay unwholesome for a long time. They get routed out really quickly because number one, we're on guard, and number two, we're there to throw that stuff out. So you can imagine that Anapanasati is like the white blood cells of reality. Her job, the job of Anapanasati, is to go around investigating everything, friend or foe. And if it's foe, it's dead, it's out. So what— another way of answering the question is by saying, steady as she goes, or never mind, start again, or you're going in the right direction, you need the next step, which is exactly the same step that you had before, but now you're 3 feet closer.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. In other words, keep going at it. But like I said, the first thing that's going to go is the wholesome thoughts themselves, uh, are a bit of a racket. And so we can just get ourselves into the state of knowing that either this thought is a wholesome thought or is not much of a thought at all. And that's when we're really paying attention to our feelings. Okay, so once we get to the point where we have the Piti and Sukkha, then that too becomes the object of the meditation, which means that too, we seize that object and we work with that. And in this case, after we finish with one wholesome thought after another, after another, and we let the thought kind of go, we start paying really close attention to the Sukkha and the Piti, and the Piti gets big. It gets really wow. It gets like, oh, this really is nice. Okay. And so now we start looking at how good can we feel? But then we build that up in a way of how good can we feel? And then later, over a period of time, maybe a day or two or a month or a week or whatever later, We begin then to see that the wow is also a bit energetic. And so we can let that kind of go at peace, just like we let the completely wholesome mind— you see, when the mind is full of hindrances, is all over the place, is jumping, it's very agitated. When the mind is one wholesome thought after another after another, that's a much more sophisticated, much more peaceful state. But then not having many thoughts at all, or not much thinking at all, is even more restful and peaceful than that. And that's because we're paying attention now to feelings. Once we start paying attention to the feelings, the feelings get really big. And so now we start working with the feelings of letting the wowness factor go down to just subside into really, this is so pleasurable, it's so nice, but it doesn't have the wow so much anymore, knowing that we can bring the wow back any time we want to. Yeah, okay, but the wow is a little bit much after a while. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Is this also the difference between the Buddha talking in Anapanasati Sutta about experiencing rapture in difference to experiencing pleasure? Yes, in the second tetrad he says that.

**Speaker A:** So, right, this is the Anapanasati, talks about it, and also it's specifically mentioned when they're talking of Jhana that, let us say it this way, the hallmark or the crowning glory or the linchpin or the hook for First Jhana is applied and sustained thought, applying to the wholesome and keeping it. Okay. For the Second Jhana, the linchpin, the focal point, the main issue is Piti. For the Jhārajāna, The reference point is Sukkha. For the fourth jhana, we start with the reference point of even the Sukkha melts into equanimity. But this kind of equanimity is really aloof, really above it all.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So nothing is there to bother. And that actually I was talking earlier to Robert about this. Is that when we begin to see Anicca, because this fits in exactly with what you were talking, once we begin to see that everything is in a cycle, everything is in Samsara, whether the frequency— and I'll use the frequency in engineering terms— when the frequency is extraordinarily fast, we're down into picosecond or nanosecond level. But when we get into visible light, that's at a much slower frequency than— okay, the other language would be X-rays, gamma rays, and visible light rays. These very, very fast things, light rays down into radio waves, down into sound waves. And there is Only the way that humans think about it is there any boundaries in there. In science, just faster or slower is the only point. There are no boundaries for visible light, that in fact some animals can see things beyond where humans can see it. Yeah, both in sensitivity and frequency.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And we can also say that even though Ultraviolet radiation, we can't see it. It'll burn your skin if you stay out, right? Yeah, that's very, very high frequency. We can't see that radio, but guess what? There are some animals who can see that. Then in fact, this is how bees collect nectar. Yeah, it's because when a bee has been on a flower, it changes color. Slightly in a range where humans can't see it, but the bees can. So they could look at a whole flower field and say, that particular flower way over there hasn't been visited, and there I'm going. And humans will not have a clue about which flowers to go to. They'll pull it all up. They'll destroy the patch because they can't see straight the way that the bees can. Okay, so coming down the scale, is sound waves, and below sound waves at about 20 cycles is where hearing stops. But above that frequency range at 60 and 100 cycles per second, those frequencies actually can be felt and picked up by the body. Hmm.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And that bodily pickup will go even slower than the range of hearing. So an example of that is, is that the very, very low pedal on a very high-quality pipe organ, the notes will be so low that the human ear can't hear it anymore, but the whole body is vibrating with that note, and you know what it is. Okay? And that's kind of spectacular, that we can actually feel those feelings, those cycles. There are other cycles that are much slower than that. Some cycles come in centuries. One cycle we know of with the eons is a 25,000-year cycle, and the precession of the equinox of the, let us say, the zodiac symbols are like the hands of a clock, and it takes one cycle, 25,000 years, and each clock hour of that is called an age. Yeah, we started off with the Age of Aquarius, or we're now in the Age of Aquarius. We know starting with the Age of Taurus, and they actually did worship bulls, and then they went to rams, and then they went to fish, and then they now are from Pisces into Aquarius. So this is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius, 2000. So we're talking about some long cycles here. Other cycles happen at other intervals, but the important thing is, is that everything is at a cycle. Everything. Hmm. Okay. Politics are on their own kinds of cycles. The way that people look at things are on their own kind of cycles. And some things interrupt those cycles and start a new cycle. An example was when printing came by first, when writing came by, that revolutionized humanity, started cities. Then the Gutenberg press came by. We started printing Bibles. And that started the Hundred Years' War. But it was— and then the internet comes by and look what kind of changes are here also. But there's always a lot of unwholesome in the beginning, and then it begins to get purified and more wholesome. And you can see how that is in the internet. And most people, let us say, 5 or 10 years ago, if it was on the internet, it was good enough. Now we're getting more careful. We know which sites to visit and which sites to avoid. And so, and so do the internet providers that provide services like searching. Google knows what kind of places to avoid, which means then the real garbage begins to get filtered down to the bottom because it's not stirred up anymore. And so therefore, over time, wisdom comes in. So wisdom or understanding is one of the kickers that changes us. And Martin Luther King had that statement when he says that the arc of the universe is long, but it bends towards justice. Actually, what he meant to say was that it bends towards knowledge. It bends towards people seeing what's going on, and justice will naturally follow wisdom. Yeah, it just naturally follows. So we're now kind of deep into this issue of everything is on a cycle. When we understand the teaching of the Buddha of Anicca, that's what he means, is that everything is on a cycle. And sometimes when the cycle's completed, it doesn't start up again. Sometimes things fade away and die, like thoughts. Okay, just one thought is a cycle, and then another cycle, but a different thought, and then another cycle, and then a different thought. Just like an election and you have a new president, and then another election and you have another president, and then another election you have another president. So things keep changing like this. If we understand that everything is like that and we really put that as wisdom for the point of contact when we have Sati, then we can say, wait a minute, why should I get attached to what place on that cycle it is? Just because now the cycle is going up doesn't mean a thing because it's eventually going to start coming down. So if it's going to go up and then it's going down, why should I feel bad when it's going up and feel bad when it's going down? Yeah, that's the Dharma right there. If we understand the nature, we understand that everything is going over and over and over again. Why do I have to say I like it because it's this way and I don't like it because it's that way, and I like it this because it's this way and I don't like it because it's that way, and I like it because it's this way and I don't like it because it's that way? Look at the mess of the mind. Yeah, the mind is in a mess because there's just a cycle going on and we're not wise to the cycle. We're ignorantly grasping and clinging to the part of the cycle we like or don't like, and we're missing out on the fact that this is just a cycle. It's just a cycle we're on. Yeah, we see that we can let go of any particular point that we used to cling to on that cycle. So, now let's get to the statement that you had, that in the Pali it's: Anicca, Sankhara, Anatta; Anicca, Sankhara, Dukkha; Anicca, Dharma, Anatta. Why is that? First off, let's understand the distinction between the Dharma and the Samskara. Once we understand that, then it will fall into place easily, especially if we define it in that context. Okay. The way that we can say it then is that Dhamma is a superset and the Samskara is a subset. Okay. And so that means that even in this subset, in this small thing, Anicca, Sankhara— excuse me, Sabe, Sankhara, and Nietzsche— that says that anything within that subset, that little thing, everything in there is constantly changing. But there are some things outside of that subset that are not constantly changing. They stay static. For a long, long period of time. And what we refer to that in English language, we use the word noble. And an example of that is that there's a few noble elements, and Argon is one of them. What do we mean by a noble element? And you just don't mess with other elements. It will not go into combination with them. But in fact, in the original days, they used tungsten as a filament and Argon as the gas for the first working commercial light bulbs. Why? Because the Argon, didn't matter how hot the tungsten got, the Argon was not going to mess with it. Any other kind of atmosphere or gas that you put in there with the tungsten, it's going to destroy the tungsten. They found that even trying to do it with a vacuum, you can't get a perfect vacuum. You could fill that whole area with Argon so that all that touches that filament is Argon. But if you try to take all the gas out, then there's going to be enough left gases in there that are going to get attracted to the heat. They're going to come bomb right in there, even in a vacuum. If it's not 100% vacuum, it's going to destroy that tungsten filament. But argon won't mess with it. That's noble. Okay, so we mean, we know now that there are some things in reality that don't mess with other stuff. They're in fact not in compound, which is exactly what Samskara means. Samskara means coming together, stuck together. So you could say it in a physical level, that molecules are Samskara. Noble elements are Dharma. And we can also understand that, that there are other things besides just a few gases here and there that are noble. And another one that you could talk about, that there are some things that are true, they have been true all along, they will remain true, and there is no way for those things to become untrue without completely destroying the universe in the process. Okay, an example of that would be the strong nuclear force. That's been there from a much shorter period of time than day one. It's like microseconds. One. And that strong nuclear force has been there and it remains. So that means that these forces that we're talking about, and there's actually 4 of them that are primary, but we could call them noble, or noble forces. The strong, the strong nuclear force is— they actually have a word for it. They call them gluons because they glue things that will not stay together, they glue them together. And it takes a huge amount of energy to glue those things together, protons. And so that means if you can go in and break those protons up, that's going to release all that gluon energy that's holding them together.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Then there is the next force, which is the electrons going around the nucleus, and that is called the weak nuclear force. Why do electrons stay running around the proton-neutron nuke part. But then we begin to say, but there's other things, and that is there's two more. One is, is that because particles can stay together and stuck together, that gives them mass. Hence you have gravity. And because these electrons can be knocked out of their valence And others can be knocked in, or other things like that. That gives us the entire electromagnetic force. So we now have 4 noble forces. Okay, let me also tell you that I know of 4 noble truths. What are they? That there is suffering. Yeah, this is a noble truth. It has been noble before humans were humans. Yeah, and it will remain that way so long as there are animals that have feelings. There will be bad feelings, ignorance, because the source of this Dukkha is not life itself. This is a major mistake that a lot of Westerners make when they hear the Four Noble Truths. They immediately say life is suffering, and that's not at all what the Buddha says. What he says instead is there is unsatisfactoriness in the mind. And he doesn't actually add in the mind, but it's very clear when you see the Second Noble Truth is what's in the mind is wanting things to be different than they are, wanting things to be good. If it's going up, I like it. I want it to continue going up. And if it's going down and I don't like it, I want it to stop going down. I want to actually stop nature itself. I actually want to interrupt the rhythms of nature. Yeah, that means that I'm trying to interrupt nature's plan, which is exactly what happens with Christians when they pray to God. They want God to change his plan. God don't change plan. This stuff is noble. It doesn't change because somebody wants it to change.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So now that we've established what noble is as opposed to what is ordinary, and that both the ordinary and the noble are together in all of it, and the whole show is in the Dhamma, the big thing, the big it. And then we can say that within all of it, whether it's in the Sankhara or whether it's in the noble part, in no case is there an existing self. Yeah, the self does not permanently exist. It's not hiding away inside of anything the way that Christians and religious people think of a self or a soul as something that is permanent. But basically what that is, is it's merely a concept, and it's a concept that helps salve the fear of death, because in fact The entire job of the self-preservation instinct is to keep an organism alive, and the mechanism that it uses to do that, or the language that it speaks, is the language of fear, which means it's self-preservation. So if I can convince myself with a concept that I'm not going to die, then I feel better.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But that's a lie, which means that when the truth is found out, people are going to suffer greatly. But there's another way of thinking about it, and that is that I die, but so what? It's not important. It's just part of the cycle. I come and I go. Nothing big here at all. Nothing important. Nothing to see here. The police says just move along. All right, why is that? Because there's really no self that needs to be protected. It's just a self-preservation mechanism. That is built in to keep you safe. And it has in fact saved your life at least once, at least once in your life, and maybe many times. You decided, oh, I'm not going to go there, it's dangerous. Yeah, like for instance, you're about to step out in the street and you hear a car horn and your foot doesn't even hit the pavement. You stop mid-step, right? Fear.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So that, that self-preservation mechanism gets us safe. But there's another way, and that is that we can get ourselves safe through wisdom. In other words, we can find ways of avoiding danger. And one of the ways to do that is go to a hut, an empty hut, a pile of straw, a seat under a chair, or the forest. Yeah, this is what the Buddha recommends for going into seclusion, because he's actually talking about going into a place where there's really, really safe.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And there is where we can experience safety, which means we can experience the issue of no self. There's no self here because there's no self to protect, because the self-preservation mechanism is not operating, because there's nothing to fear. This is the whole point about, uh, uh, uh, Sabe, Sankhara, Anicca. Anything that can come together will fall apart. Then in fact, this teaching of Anicca is the Buddha's understanding of Murphy's Law. The Buddha knew Murphy's Law, you know, 25 centuries before Murphy figured it out, and he worked from there. And what is that? That anything that can go wrong will go wrong, and it'll go wrong at the worst possible moment. And the Buddha talks about that in the sense of Anicca, Vajrayana, Samskara. Anything that can go wrong, Anicca, will go wrong. Any Samskara will fall apart. It will change. It will modify. Yeah, it modifies, and it mostly modifies when it's under stress, when it's under pressure, when it's Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so there's Murphy's Law. It's just stated completely differently, but that's the whole point of Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta. Now we can think of and just pin it down and forget about the Sankhara and the Dhamma for a second and look at the Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta, which is called the Trimokkha. Without having the Samskara and the Dhamma mixed in with it to make things even more complicated. And still people get confused even with three. The right way to look at it is look at it as a path or a road that you're taking, and you come across a fork in the road. That fork in the road now is the Anicca. Something changed. All roads have forks or intersections. You cannot— what's the use of having a road if it's got no forks and no intersections? Roads like that don't exist. Back to the whole point of everything's in a cycle, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And one of the ways of thinking is, is that the cycle is, is you've got an intersection or a Y or a divergence followed by narrow or long stretches of road. That has no entrance or exit, and then you have another entrance and exit, and you have that repeated on and on and on. That's the definition of a road. A road that has no entrance and no exits is not a road at all, just highway pavement. Maybe it's a runway, I don't know. Yeah, okay. So now that we've defined this idea that, that, uh, that Anicca means that we're on a road and we've come to a fork in the road, and the one fork or one is Dukkha, and the other fork is Anatta. Think of it like that. So it's like a Y, and the base of the Y is Anicca, and one fork, the top part, is Dukkha, and the other one is Anatta. So when anything changes, you've got a choice. Are you going to deal with it wisely as if it's not you? Are you going to deal with it ignorantly as if it is you? And that's the road to Dukkha. Yeah, and it's really that simple. You've got a choice here, your choice at Anicca, Dukkha, Arhat. At that point of Anicca, when things change, you've got a choice. You're either going to not like it or get wrapped up in that choice, and therefore the self is evident, or— and therefore there's going to be remorse or Dukkha, liking and not liking. Or you can shoot the other side up. Not mine, not me. I'm equanimous here. Yeah, I'm aloof. I'm above all that. That's just another one of those Anicca cycles. And it's not me, not mine, and doesn't belong to me, and not my business. And we're above it all. Therefore, no Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So is this the difference that Buddha is talking about between Avicca and Vipassana? Like ignorance and true knowledge?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Or is it something different?

**Speaker A:** No, that's it. The ignorance is to not know that you have a choice when something changes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Which means that instead of taking a new proper action, we merely do the same thing that we have done before. We act in the same way. We react.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So when we react to something, that means we're going down the old path. We're going down the way of our karma. We're going down the path to Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that path may be very short. It may be a microsecond, but that's the path. So the way to understand it is, is that we need to be awake. We need to have Sati. At that point when things change, which would be also the point of contact so that we could choose how we're going to feel wisely, like, oh my God, that's so terrible, into not my problem.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And our society is really, really good in propaganda form in the sense of trying to make everything your problem. That's what German propaganda was, uh, with Hitler, but it hasn't changed a bit. Maybe the color from red and white to red, white, blue, but other than that, it's the same propaganda. Red, white, black— excuse me, from red, white, black, red, white, and blue. But that's the only thing that's been changed, is just the color of the propaganda. And what is propaganda? The propaganda is, is that things are terrible and it's your fault and you better go do something about it. Come vote for me. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so our society is set up to keep us reacting.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And now you recognize you don't have to react anymore. You can respond wisely now instead if you can wake up in time before you react.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So maybe I was also reading the first verse of the Dhammapada where the Buddha says, 'Mano pupanga ma dhamma.' So the mind is the very most important thing, isn't it?

**Speaker A:** So, or to say, the forerunner, that's what you're talking about. Yes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, is it— you have the 4 Satipatthanas, but can you say that the mind is the most important by the Buddha giving this statement in the Dhammapada?

**Speaker A:** This is basically where that is coming from. There's a sutta that has some background with it. Yeah, okay. And in the sutta, it talks about the fact that the Brahmins have a belief system about their Kamma, you know, their Kamma machine, or their good action gives good results and bad action gives bad results. And I've even seen their point of view said in a modern text, and we'll get to that in a moment. But let's review what they were talking about, and that is that action, physical action, can harm someone. Therefore, it is strong. It's very much like writing something in stone. That once you kill somebody, they're dead. There's no bringing them back. That's it. Okay. The next part is speech. That speech is like writing in the sand, that people don't remember it long after the next wave of the ocean, the tide comes in, and maybe that's forgotten about. But, but think— thinking, our thoughts, is like writing in the water or writing in the air, that as soon as the writing is finished, it's gone. And because of that, the Brahmins say it's got no weight at all, it's got no power, it's got nothing to it. So you can go around thinking all the bad thoughts you want, so long as you keep your mouth shut and your hands in your pocket. Guess what? When the mind is that filthy and that dirty, the hands are not in the pocket and the mouth is not closed. It's always open. It's out. And it's like, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, is what we do. So the point then that the Brahmins were making is, is that everything, uh, that they said was upside down. And the Buddha makes the point, oh no, the mind is the forerunner, that if you do not have that thought, then you will not say it. And if you don't have the thought then you won't act. That actions and speech are dependent upon the mind. Okay, so we say, well, wait a minute, the Buddha has precepts. No, the Buddha didn't have those precepts. He had wisdom. The precepts came centuries later, many centuries later, but they got all of the precepts out of the suttas. So I know where they got them, but they changed them in the process. Okay, uh, it's the distinction between, let us say, eating fruit fresh off the tree versus eating fruit that's been highly processed. Okay, that's what we mean now, is the precepts are highly processed fresh fruit from the Buddha. In the sense that if your mind is clean and you don't want anything, then you're unlikely to kill someone.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, definitely.

**Speaker A:** OK, but now the other Buddhists, they go and they make a rule of it all. Thou shalt not kill. Yeah, that's going too far. Actually, the Pali is paññatipattawayadhammānicca, Sukkhābadhamma, Samadhi, Anicca, which means I will refrain from killing as a training mechanism. In other words, the precepts that Upadana is not taking, Vajrayana, Sukkhavadhamma, Samatha is the training or the coming together of the mind. Okay. When the mind is together. So the training is to avoid taking things that are not— that don't belong to you, because you can see the Dukkha in that. So it still has to do with training the mind, not training the hands.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So the real point is, is that it's not a matter of what we actually do. It's a matter of what we're thinking at all levels. But we're trying to get the beginning students to start thinking because they're so slow, they could begin to think as they're acting. But as they gain skill at it, they begin to see what's going on and see the Dukkha before they act or before they speak. And an example also of that is, let us say the two guys are in an argument and neither one of them have a clue about what's going on with the Dhamma. And so they argue and they argue and they argue, and as they build up to the point of violence, and then one person will finally wake up, oh, this is going nowhere. Why don't we just have a beer and forget about this? Or maybe somebody comes up and intervenes. If nobody intervenes and nobody can think about it, that argument will wind up in violence.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so you can see a husband and wife are fighting at home, and then the husband says something that's gone too far. He recognizes he Finally wakes up, he's still really angry, but he slams the door on the way out. Said, I've had enough of this. That's very, very wise. Why? Because if he stays and fights with the wife, he's going to hurt her, and he knows it. But this is too far into the game. The question is, how soon can we wake up to this? Yeah, this is where it comes with the idea that the Arahant, the Anagami, the Srotapanna, and the Srotapanna have to do with how fast can we wake up.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so the way that you could think of it then would be that the Srotapanna knows that anger is wrong. He's kind of on the alert for it. And so if he gets himself into an argument after a few exchanges, he'll quit because he knows that this is wrong and he can see it. They say, in fact, up to 7 times he'll run his mouth for 7 times and then he'll shut up. Ordinary people, they'll keep running their mouth. They'll just keep on and on and on and on and on running their mouth. But a Srotapanna will shut up after a little while. Okay. And then the next level will be the once-returner, the Sakadagami, is when just one shout— and I've seen that happen. Okay. Like one hard drive falls over and But that's the end of it right there. Just one outburst is all it takes. No, no, wait a minute. I'm better than that. I am not going to hassle somebody over something that goes wrong. That's my problem. Okay. And so we wake up, but we wake up after we've done one outburst.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But then we get even sharper than that so that we can catch it before the outburst. Yeah, if we can catch it before the outburst, now we have absolutely full control over it. This is the point of the Anagami, the guy who can shut his mouth before he opens it. But the Arahant, he's got no place to go because it didn't bother him at all in the first place. Yeah, so he's got nothing to say. It's not that he has to stifle that anger is because he's got no anger. He's not angry. Therefore, he doesn't have to shout and then suppress one shout, or to shout a few times and then figure it out and then stop, or to just shout and let it rip for a long time until finally this is really dangerous and then finally pick up. So this whole point, this also has a lot to do about the spiritual path when they talk about and AA mentions this, but it's everywhere, and that is hitting rock bottom, hitting a low spot. What that really means is, is that we don't know how low they can go. But what we do know is that the deeper into Dukkha someone goes, the more likely that pain will wake them up to the fact that they're in pain. So as the continuum goes down like this, some people up here when they're good Dhamma dudes, as soon as the Dukkha starts, I got it, I'm out of here. Other people will come down, and they will come down and hit this level, and then they'll come back up. That's rock bottom for them. Other people will go way down, and that's rock bottom for them, and then they'll come up. And some people just keep on going and they never figure it out. After they're dead, they don't figure it out. So how low can you go until it hurts too much for you to keep going that way.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so this is part of the wake-up call, is that now that we know that that, uh, that Dukkha diagonal is there, how deep into it are you going to go before you wake up? Because you will eventually wake up, or you're dead. Those are the only two choices. You either got to wake up or you're dead. That's almost like when you see that a car crash is coming, how soon can you put your foot on the brake? Yeah, you're just going to watch that truck come right at you before you put your brakes on? Or that wall? Okay, the sooner you put brakes on, the less damage you're going to do at impact.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, now we can say that that's true in, uh, reality of trucks and whatnot. We can also see that that happens almost on a split-second level. That if we can put the brakes on it a half a second sooner, we can avoid the entire collision.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and it's very funny, like, you— to take that simile you were talking about, then if you recognize really late that you are running around unwholesome thoughts, the effort you have to bring up to get back into a wholesome state, it's much more than— it's like you

**Speaker A:** said, it's almost like we have to unwind it. You're right. If we— once we get wound up, we have to do some unwinding. If we don't ever get wound up, no unwinding to do. Or if we've only got one wind on it, there's only one wind to undo.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so that's exactly right. How soon can we wake up? Or another way of saying it, once the Anicca happens, how far down the Y fork of Dukkha am I going to go before I wake up to recognize this is not me, this is not who I am, this is not what I want to be? Let me jump over to the other Y fork.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** but it always is triggered by something, and that trigger is always some motion, some movement, some cycling, some Anicca. Yeah, that's always a trigger. And so when we see that trigger, if we're alert to those triggers, we can always choose Anatta. Yeah, because really all of reality is Anatta. There really is no self. What there is is a self-preservation mechanism but it's protecting not the self, it's protecting the organism. And the humans are making the mistake: I am the organism. Yeah, well, what is an organism then? I am the feelings, I am the body, I am the thoughts, I am this whole show, this whole Satipatthana. I am— that is the big mistake. Yeah, why? Because that's just going to be Dukkha when it's my body. If it's just the body— an example of that, and we do it often— going to the dentist or into surgery. If we give the teeth to the dentist and let him do his work and trust him, then our dental procedures will be easy. If we don't trust that dentist, we're looking at every little thing that he does and you're feeling with every little probe that he makes and all of that kind of stuff. That's stupid. Yeah, because we don't trust him. We don't just let him do his thing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So we have to, in that regard, if we're going to go to a dentist, you got to trust the dentist. If you don't trust the dentist, don't go to that one. Go to another dentist that you trust, but don't go to a dentist that you don't trust. All you're doing is paying a whole lot of money for a a lot of misery when you can pay the money without the misery.

**Speaker B:** Hearing you talking about all these things or all these places you can investigate, it sounds so easy to do all that. And would you say it is easy?

**Speaker A:** Well, there's only one thing at a time though. Yeah, for instance, while you're in the dental chair having the dental work done, you're not in surgery. That's not physically possible. Yeah. Okay, so just one moment at a time. Whatever's happening now, let's be alert to it. Yeah, because we always have a choice to make. What is that choice? Is either not me or I'm stuck in it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** It's either mine or not mine. That's why Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, his number one most favorite statement that's written perhaps in every book that he's published or that's been published under his name, and that is the quote: nothing is worth clinging to as I, me, or mine. Except that the point is, is that you can't cling to anything without I, me, or mine.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** An example of that is imagine a balloon that's got a string on it. Yeah, so there's a string, so what? The balloon just floats off into the air because it's got helium or something in it, as opposed to the child holding that string, grasping and clinging to that string. Why? Because the child has the thought, that balloon is mine. Yeah, okay. Which means that anytime that there is any grasping or clinging, there has to be a cling-or. Without a cling-or, there's no clinging. For instance, that balloon can have a string on it, but nobody's clinging to that string, and therefore the blue— the balloon is free.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So it's only the self which has the identification of mine. Yeah, ownership.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And it's that quality of ownership that gives rise to— because it's mine and I own it, if it breaks, then I feel bad, because I and mine are the same thing. Um, that happens really in politics quite often, when someone identifies with a particular political party. Any day, something good and something bad is going to happen to every political party. Things happen pretty Vipassana, in an election, 10,000 things can happen good and 20,000 things can happen bad for every political party, right? Yeah. Therefore, if you are identified with a political party, then everything that bad happens to that political party, and I will feel bad because I am Republican. Yeah. And everything that happens bad to the Republicans, and not only that, but I have to defend the Republicans. Why do I have to repent to the Republicans? Because they're helpless without me. I'm the Republican here. And Trump and crowd is able to tap into that so easily, because everybody has that feeling or belief. Another example is people who get involved with a sports team, and they'll say, it's my team, home team. Right? If that guy goes to the offices of the people who actually own that team, walks in and sits down at the CEO's desk, they're going to throw him out because it's only in his mind that it's his team, and everybody else's mind, no, that's our team, not yours, get out.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so we do really crazy things, like when we identify with something, that's the same thing as we own it. This also happens with corporations, and NGOs are especially good at this. Yeah. What we mean by that is people come and work for an NGO because they want to do good. By joining the NGO, they see the NGO is doing good. Therefore, because the NGO is doing good, we should keep it going and preserve it. Okay. And so that means then that the ego is tied to it. So the workers of a particular NGO want to keep that NGO functioning and alive because two reasons. One is their job depends upon it, and two, their ID depends upon it. And that's even more important. Okay. And you can see things that happen like that. The Red Cross is a clear example of this. 80% of all the donated money that Red Cross receives goes to support their staff and advertisements, and only 20% of the money they receive goes to do the original job. Okay, only 20% of it. Why? Because the people who work for the NGO, and the NGO is more important than the job the NGO was supposed to do in the first place. Yeah, that's selfishness for you. That's it. Yeah. And you can see that in many, many NGOs. In other words, here's the way that they stay at impact, because it's well known, and that is the number one job now of the Red Cross is to remain the Red Cross. The number one job of an NGO is to remain in the business of being that NGO, never mind what the NGO originally was trying to do here.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Which is another way of stating that well-known phrase that is known in Washington, D.C. It's kind of a line drawing that can be put into a Xerox, and so it's just all over the place, thousands of photos or reproductions of this. And it's a line drawing of a young man standing in a swamp or a pond, and he is surrounded by alligators in this line drawing. And the caption at the bottom is, is that when you're up to your hips in alligators, it's hard to remember your original intention was to drain the swamp. Yeah, you're up to your hip in alligators, it's hard to remember your original intention was to drain the swamp. Well, that's the what happens with organizations like the Red Cross.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Is that now their alligators are more important to them than their original draining of the swamp. In other words, keeping the NGO going is important and the draining of the swamp, they've forgotten all about that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** That's what's going on with us also at an ordinary level. And that's especially true when we identify with another organization. In this regard, this is where the Buddha talks about part of the freedom is to lower the banner. There's in fact four of them, and that is to fill in the moat or the trench, to set down the crossbar, to lower the banner, and to unlock the door. These are the four qualities of an Arahant. OK, what do we mean by filling in the boundary, or filling in the moat, or filling in the trench? Means that we're no longer expecting an enemy invasion, so we don't have to build ramparts. We don't have to, let us say, require people to have the right kind of visa to get in. Everybody's welcome. Anybody who wants to come and go. Don't keep boundaries anymore. The second one, which is actually the one— the second one to mention is actually the first one on the Buddha's list, and it's basically to set down our weapons. We don't carry weapons, we don't carry crossbows or swords with hilts or any of that kind of stuff. So we completely are free from weapons. The third one then is this non-identification with any organization. To put down the banner. So any organization that has a banner, a flag, or an icon is not worth identifying with.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, not even the Dhamma.

**Speaker A:** Not even the Dharma. I mean, there are Buddhist flags for Buddhists to attach to Buddhist flags, but the Dharma has no flag. Yeah, it has no identity. It has nothing to cling to.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So, when we lower the banner, or lower the flag, you can see that the banners, in fact, were used in the old days with warfare; that the Roman soldiers, they used their banners a lot, that the king or the generals would know how to deploy troops based upon whether the banner was still up or not and where the forces were and all of that kind of stuff. So it's really, really significant, that issue of the banner. Okay. So when you see anything that has a banner, whether it's a red, white, and blue donkey or red, white, and blue elephant, or let us say a cross and a shield, or perhaps a star and a crescent, whatever the sign is, that's not me. Yeah, don't identify with anything. Even though Thailand has a flag, when I see the flag of Thailand, I don't think about my country. I just see, oh yeah, that's just another symbol to not get attached to.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And then the last one, which is actually the deepest one of all, and that is to unlock or unbar the door. So we've put down our weapons, we filled in the trenches, we don't have the bar, and now even in the inner sanctum, the home, we don't lock the door. Why? Because we know that locking a door is not going to keep death out. Yeah, death don't need no door to knock on. But what we can also think of it is, is that really it's open heart. Anybody who comes to the door, the door is unlocked. But then we can greet people in various ways. And the lowest class ways, we could deal with them as if they were a hot enemy. That's the lowest. The next one would be like a Cold War.

**Speaker B:** More.

**Speaker A:** Like, what the hell do you want? And then the next one up, it would be what we call in Buddhism acceptance or toleration. Okay, that we tolerate them until they do something wrong, and then we hurt them. And then acceptance is, is that even if they do wrong, we'll let them get away with it, but we remember that, we'll hold them against it. We're keeping score here, you know. Them. And then we come up from acceptance into friendship, and that is when we greet them at the door. Hi, how are you doing? Glad to see you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But then there's the highest level of all, and that highest level of all has a Latin phrase, and that Latin phrase is amor fati. Now amor fati means actually to be in love with fate. But we're not talking about fate in the Christian sense of what's going to happen a long time from now, or that whatever happens is that's a disaster, you deserve it. But we're talking about fate in the sense of whatever is happening right now, whatever fate brings to my door, I am glad to see it. We become jovial and loving. Whatever comes to the door, that not only is the door unlocked, but they're always a super welcome guest. And we could welcome this moment that way, that, wow, I'm really glad to be here now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So this is what we mean by unlocking the door completely, so that we're completely open to anything that comes. And these four then is the sign of the Arahant, the one who has no borders. No boundaries. The trench, the ramparts, the moat has all been filled in. We carry no weapons. We're not here to either hurt ourselves or to protect ourselves from danger because there's nothing dangerous. Yeah, why? Because I don't stay in dangerous places. If there was danger on Koh Phangan, I'd go over to Koh Samui. And so there's no danger here. We could put down the weapons, put down our swords, put down our crossbows, put down anything that we would think that we need for protection, because we don't need protection.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And yet look at the dialogues that you have, for instance, on Reddit, where everybody is under attack verbally and they think they have to defend themselves verbally. So in fact, these weapons that we're talking about can often be both mental and verbal as well as physical weapons.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** But we don't have to defend ourselves, and so because we don't have to defend ourselves, we don't need these verbal weapons. We don't need these verbal daggers and swords and spikes and arrows and whatnot.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So, um, this is kind of a new way of living. Yeah, just the automatic assumption for ordinary society is things are dangerous, they need to be checked out. Yeah, or we need to hide immediately. But the noble way is, is that, yeah, it may be dangerous, but I'm going to go check it out and we'll find out what's going on.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, hearing you talking about all this, I recognize that my that my mind changed through the practice because there are many stressful situations in everyday life. I now pretty much don't react that much as I was doing before. So, oh, now you know.

**Speaker A:** That's the Dharma for you. It works, doesn't it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. That is a proof of a principle that you practice the right way.

**Speaker A:** Everybody says that if people start to practice correctly, they all say it has great fruit, great benefit. The whole life begins to change. The things that used to bother don't bother anymore. Yeah, we can see that they're part of a cycle. We can see that if I, if I grab hold of it, it's going to bite me. I better leave it alone. It doesn't belong to me.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so all of this stuff— go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and even, or especially, the stressful situations to me are the best places to practice because it's a real proof whether you are on, whether you really transformed your mind already or not.

**Speaker A:** That's right. Which means then that we're no longer afraid of being tested.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** You see it as an opportunity.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, definitely.

**Speaker A:** Flexing the muscles. Yeah, I can handle that too. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's really great. That's actually the kind of thing that I like to hear from the students.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Because it shows just one more person showing that this stuff works.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** not that they didn't know that, but it's good to see it continues to work. Yeah, that the path of the Buddha is a functional path. It's been all along, it's just sometimes become obscured.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and this was also a question I was having: didn't the Buddha teach his teachings to everybody, also to the people who were not highly intelligent and doctors and whatever. He taught it to everybody, didn't he? So it would work for everybody.

**Speaker A:** That's a question. Okay. The answer to it is complicated. Let me give you part of the answer. Part of the answer is absolutely yes. Anyone can get enough to do what they need to do. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Anyone can learn enough of the Dhamma. In fact, there's not much to the Dharma, which means that someone who is not capable of grasping all the details that you and I talk about, they would get lost in that, but they could still do something if they want to.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So it has a lot to do with the motivation, and the motivation always has to do with how well can they see the Dukkha. And even really unintelligent people with no skills and no training in the Dharma can still see Dukkha in their life.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And if they can, then they're trainable.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And let me give you one example of that. There was one student that was passed from one teacher to another because he could not remember any of the chants, because in the old days, the way that they did it was that they taught the sutta to the students, and after the student memorized it completely, then he was told what it means.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So they had it memorized so that they had all the details of it, but they didn't quite know how to put it into practice until it was explained to them over and over. But then that sutta becomes a really guiding principle for them for much of their life. But this one guy couldn't do that. He couldn't remember, even though he would hear the thing over and over and over again, he couldn't remember it. And some of us can do that kind of stuff and some not. But it's an old form of learning that has both benefits and drawbacks. An example of that is the madrasa, where when the kids— it takes them years to do it, but the point of the madrasa is that the student can recite without prompting the entire Quran. That skill, and I highly appreciate that skill, but it's not deductive logic. He cannot suss things out for himself. It's not wisdom, but it is the fact that he can remember. Yeah. And so that's very, very valuable. This guy that we're talking about couldn't do that. He couldn't remember anything. So the Buddha gave him a particular skill to do. And that was— he actually gave him a piece of cloth, like a wash rag or a hand cloth or whatever like that. And he said, this is your phrase, or this is your mantra: as I clean my hands with this cloth, I clean my mind. And that was all that this guy needed. So he went off, and that was the only thing he practiced. But that was just enough for him. And he was dedicated enough, and he became free from suffering just because he had that little mantra: "I'm cleaning my mind like I'm cleaning my hands, and here I am all the time." And so the Buddha allowed this monk to walk around with this cloth in his hand, cleaning all the time. And that's all it took. OK, imagine that if we could say the entire Dharma on one, on one website. Yeah, take a piece of cloth, and while you're holding it and rubbing your hands with that cloth, say, as I clean this, my hands with this cloth, I clean my mind. Full Dharma, no more, no suttas, nothing.

**Speaker B:** That's the whole show.

**Speaker A:** And that would be enough. But for intellectual people, they'll read that and say, well, that's not enough, I want more. Yeah, so it depends upon the mind of the individual as to what they can handle, and also whether or not they can Dukkha or not. Yeah, because a lot of people can't see Dukkha. They don't want to see it. They're not supposed to see it. It's bad, you know. Yeah, and because it's bad and they're not supposed to have any of it, you're not supposed to see it, therefore they won't look at it. Yeah, church moms are like this. The church ladies, the church ladies, right? Well, because the church ladies are always going around saying this is wrong and that's wrong, and they never look at the fact that they're actually causing trouble rather than trying to solve it. They're actually out there trying to solve trouble, but boy, do they cause it. Yeah, why? Because they can't see the Dukkha. If she— if the church lady can see the Dukkha and see what she's doing, she will shut her mouth. But unfortunately, church ladies don't. Yeah, that's why they're known as church ladies.

**Speaker B:** It's funny that you're talking about a mantra because I don't use mantras, but there are many situations in everyday life where I recognize that there is stress, and then I start by investigating, like, okay, there's stress and then I start to arouse the factors that are important to get rid of the stress, like awareness. Then I arouse awareness, becoming aware of what I'm doing. Then the next step, arousing wholesome thoughts. And yet it's not like a mantra, but it's like always using the same tool. Would you recommend that, like having a strong tool, like starting over and over again the same process, or or doesn't it matter if you just put up wholesome thoughts, whatever it is?

**Speaker A:** There is room for mantras. And in the case that we just gave you of this guy, it was a good starting point because there were no other good starting points.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** But generally what we can say is, is that mantras are so powerful because they're so short.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And because they're so short, that means that we keep repeating them over and over and over again. And each time we do, we build a little Sati.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** OK, this is in fact an example of how this is used is in the Mantra Budo.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Now there's a lot of different ways of using it, but the But the most beneficial is when the mind is completely wholesome so that there are no thoughts left but wholesome. Then the most wholesome thought that we could have right then and there would be this word 'Buddho.' 'Buddho' on the in-breath and 'Dho' on the out-breath. With that the only word, that means that now the mind is really, really focused in the wholesome and there's only one thought happening, which means that then this thought is fairly easy to let go of because the mind is so focused that all the wholesome thoughts are down to just two words. Yeah, well, taking two words out of one's vocabulary is easy enough to do with some practice. I know because I've taken the word try and the word should out of my vocabulary. And at the right time, boo and dough can be also removed from the vocabulary. But in that case, now there's nothing left as far as language goes, and there's nothing left but then the feelings of the Piti and the Sukkha to be investigated. So this is where mantras become extraordinarily valuable as a tool to be used already in the first Jhana to limit the number of thoughts so that we can get closer and closer to the second Jhana.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay, I see.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but they can be started right from the beginning. I mean, if we're going to say only wholesome thoughts, okay, Buddha, Buddha, Buddha, Buddha, Buddha, you know, keep going. And there's nothing else to say but Buddha. That's all. So we could start with the Mantra, but most people can't. They'll have a boo and and then a bunch of thoughts and then a do and have a bunch more thoughts, another bu and have a bunch of thoughts. Okay, so in that regard, the mantra is not doing a whole lot. Yeah, but if we have it down to a phrase, something like, as I'm cleaning my hands with this cloth, I clean my mind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So with that one thought over and over and over again, there's nothing much left in the mind to think about.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I sometimes I have the feeling that similes are so powerful in arousing wholesome thoughts. I often think about the sentence of the Buddha saying, just like the ocean has only one taste, salty, the Dhamma has only one taste. One taste, freedom. Yeah. And as I think of this simile, saying it very aware with Sati, I it feels so powerful or so easy to arouse wholesome thoughts by using the similes. So I was also asking myself whether it is correct practice to use similes as part of Sati and every day.

**Speaker A:** You already answered your question. Of course, because certainly, yeah, because it's wholesome. Exactly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And you say, well, wait a minute, it's almost like too easy. We're taking a shortcut here. We're not doing it the correct way. And the answer is, is that no, this is the correct way. Take that shortcut. Go right there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah. And also reading the Sutta Nipatada and other poems of the Buddha in my time when I was a kid or a youth. With, like, poems didn't really mean much to me, but now using poems and all that stuff, it's so powerful in practicing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, much of the Dhamma of the suttas and the Pali language is very poetic. The language itself is set up to be poetic because of the endings of the words that have to do with case, gender, tense. All of that kind of stuff is done in the end of the which means that in the beginning it's kind of hard to figure stuff out. An example of that is the word hoti and hantu is the same root word, but hoti means right now and hantu means for all time. It's just a verb tense, okay? Which means that if you're going to do a poem, you can set it up so that the verbs are the last thing in the sentence, which means it always rhymes because you've got the same tense throughout.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** So with that, that makes that poetry very easy for the, uh, the Pali language when it's not so easy in English.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, the German in fact is better poetry than English. English is just not a good language for poetry, but Pali is. And because of that, there is a lot of the stuff in, in Pali that's just naturally poetic. There's also the story of one monk who was very slow to speak, but whenever he did speak, he was absolutely amazing because he spoke everything in poetry. Everything he said was poetic. Then you go to the Theragatha and the Theragatha, which is also very, very ancient writings, and you'll see that those in fact are The songs or the hymns or the poems of the elders, uh, of the Bhikkhunis and the Bhikkhus. Okay, the Theragatha and the Theragatha. Yeah, the Theragatha is for the gay, uh, the Bhikkhunis, and Theragatha is for the, for the monks. But you can see the teri and the teri is for the, uh, is, is the, um, the gender there, but it's in the middle of the word. But then that can be used with poetry also.

**Speaker B:** Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, is that the middle of the words can also kind of match up because they've got gender in there. So yeah, the Theragatha and the Theragatha are both highly poetic. They're in blank verse. Normally the way to translate it is to translate it and keep the verse form, even if it's not— even if it's English translation into blank verse, it's still poetically set up in verse form. The way that it was originally. Yeah, there is actually verse forms in several of the suttas in the Majjhima Nikaya that is not prose, it's poetry.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And also that's why it's highly repetitive, that in fact, you know, that in our song form today, you will have a verse and then a chorus, and then another verse that's different from the first verse, and then a chorus which is the same as the first chorus, and then third third verse, and then the chorus is the same, and that's the form. Okay, guess what? The sutras are set up that way. Yeah, but the translators take all of the chorus out. Once they put the chorus in just one time, they will leave the chorus out with ellipses. Yeah, and they miss the whole point of the song by taking the chorus repetitions out. But the monks, when they're chanting, that's the best part. Yeah, it's the chorus. Yeah, in fact, the reason they call it the, uh, the chorus— the more proper word would be the refrain. Yeah, but we call it the chorus because everybody sings the chorus. It's a choir, right? All the monks know the chorus, except in the Pali translations into English, they don't bother to put the chorus in there. They put little three dots. Watch for especially Bhikkhu Bodhisattva's little three dots, his ellipses.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I've seen that.

**Speaker A:** That shows that he's lazy. Or at that moment when those three dots came up, that was lazy. Also, the book, I got to be honest with you, the book would at least be double the size. Instead of 1,500 pages, it'd be about 3,000 pages if all of the chorus lines were taken out. Out and taken out.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So poetry, poetry, everything is poetry. But the important point about poetry is repetition. That's the whole quality of the Dhamma, is that it has to be repeated over and over and over again. This wholesome stuff has to be done over and over and over again to kind of counterbalance The fact that we spent so many years in chaotic, unwholesome thought.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Things that were wired for chaotic, unwholesome thought. And we need to rewire it with these repetition of things that happen over and over and over again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that's quite amazing when it comes to learning poetry, is that if you don't repeat a poem, you're going to forget a few lines here and there. That happens with me and the Pali, and it happens also in some of the old poems that I remember. But learning poetry is a very, very good skill, to be able to memorize something and keep it going and keeping track, especially when you go to the chorus lines, one after the other after the other. We hit these choruses, and that's when the In fact, in the typical wat that I know of in Thailand, you go in there for the morning chants, and when the chorus happens, the whole sound of the entire group gets higher volume, it's louder, because people are more confident, because they know the chorus. But that's the whole idea then, is that it's repeated over and over and over again, and when it's repeated over and over again, it becomes very very familiar. Listen to that word familiar. It's the word family. Family is that which we know because we've been in it over and over and over again. This is what— this is also what we mean by the comfort zone. Yeah, that we know this because we've repeated it over and over and over again. This is actually Sati. That's the Eightfold Noble Path. It's all based upon repetition.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** that's the whole show, over and over and over again, whether it's the Mantra or whatever it is. It's always one wholesome thought after another, over and over and over again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And it's also— and so this question

**Speaker A:** will say, yeah, but what do I do next? Well, you sing the second verse, same as the first. What do we do now? Well, we sing the chorus, same as Anicca first.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Which was about your original question. Now that I know how to practice, what do I do? The answer is, now you know how to practice, really practice, because you're good at it now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, definitely. Yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, um And I hope that we've answered the two questions that you had, which were actually interrelated.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that was Anicca, Dukkha, and Samatha, and also what we were talking about in the sense of the wholesome thoughts and whatnot.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And what do we do next? What do we do next? We sing the song again.

**Speaker B:** Great. Yeah, thank you, Bhante, for this talk. Thank you very much.

**Speaker A:** Okay, we'll see you.

**Speaker B:** See you soon. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends (primarily Speaker B), covers a wide range of interconnected topics centered on deepening meditation practice and applying Buddhist wisdom to daily life. Here is a structured summary of the key themes and teachings:

### **Core Theme: The Continuous, Cyclical Nature of Practice**
The talk begins by answering a student's question: **"Once you establish your practice correctly, what do you do next?"**  
The answer is that you **continue the same practice, but with greater speed, sophistication, and subtlety.** The goal is to maintain a stream of wholesome thoughts, quickly identify and eliminate unwholesome ones (like an immune system scanning for threats), and gradually refine the mind's state from active thinking to deeper, more peaceful levels of awareness.

### **The Progressive Refinement of Meditation (Jhāna Framework)**
Dhammarato outlines the natural progression of deepening concentration and insight, loosely mapping onto the **Four Jhānas**:
1.  **First Jhāna:** Characterized by **applied and sustained wholesome thought**.
2.  **Second Jhāna:** The focus shifts to **Pīti** (rapture/joy), a "wow" factor of energetic bliss.
3.  **Third Jhāna:** The emphasis moves to **Sukkha** (pleasure/happiness), a calmer, more serene joy as the energetic "wow" subsides.
4.  **Fourth Jhāna:** Even Sukkha mellows into **Upekkhā** (equanimity), a state of being "aloof and above it all."

The practice involves consciously working with these states, learning to cultivate them, and then letting go of the coarser aspects to reach more refined, peaceful levels.

### **The Central Insight: Anicca (Impermanence) as Universal Cycles**
A major portion of the talk is devoted to **Anicca**. Dhammarato explains it not just as "change," but as the understanding that **everything in existence operates in cycles**—from subatomic particles and light waves to political eras, seasons, and even thoughts. This cyclical nature is the fundamental law of reality.

*   **The Choice at Every Moment of Change (The "Fork in the Road"):** Whenever change (Anicca) occurs, we face a critical fork:
    *   **The Path of Dukkha (Suffering):** Reacting with ignorance, identifying with the change ("This is me/mine"), and grasping for what we like or pushing away what we dislike.
    *   **The Path of Anattā (Not-Self):** Responding with wisdom, seeing the change as impersonal ("This is not me, not mine, not my self"), and maintaining equanimity.
*   **The Formula:** **Anicca → (choice point) → Dukkha *or* Anattā.** Our spiritual progress is measured by **how quickly we can wake up (Sati)** at the moment of change and choose the wise path of Anattā, short-circuiting the habitual path to suffering.

### **Key Distinctions: Sankhara vs. Dhamma**
*   **Sankhara:** "Compounded things." All conditioned phenomena that come together and fall apart (e.g., molecules, thoughts, organizations). These are **Anicca** by nature.
*   **Dhamma (in this context):** The "noble" or fundamental principles of reality. These are like the noble gases or universal forces (gravity, strong nuclear force) that are stable and don't "mess with" other elements. The **Four Noble Truths** are this type of Dhamma—timeless, unchanging truths.

### **Practical Applications and Similes**
1.  **Letting Go of Identification:** The root of suffering is **clinging with a sense of "I, me, mine."** Examples include identifying with a political party, sports team, or even a charitable NGO (where preserving the organization can become more important than its original purpose).
2.  **The Sign of an Arahant (The Fully Liberated One):** Described through a metaphor of a fortress:
    *   **Filling the moat:** Having no boundaries; being open to all.
    *   **Laying down weapons:** Needing no defense (physical or verbal).
    *   **Lowering the banner:** Not identifying with any group, flag, or ideology—not even "Buddhism."
    *   **Unlocking the gate:** Having complete **amor fati** (love of fate)—welcoming every moment with an open, joyful heart.
3.  **The Mind is the Forerunner:** Responding to a quote from the Dhammapada, Dhammarato stresses that **all action and speech spring from the mind.** Training the mind with wholesome thoughts is the foundation; moral precepts (Sīla) are the natural result of this mental training, not rigid rules.
4.  **Tools for Practice:** The talk validates using various skillful means (**Upāya**) to cultivate wholesomeness:
    *   **Mantras** (like "Buddho") to simplify and focus the mind.
    *   **Poetry, suttas, and similes** (like "the Dhamma has one taste, the taste of freedom") to arouse wholesome thoughts and joy.
    *   **Repetition** is key—through chanting, repeating phrases, or consistent practice, we rewire the mind away from old, unwholesome habits.

### **Conclusion: The Path is Functional and for Everyone**
The talk concludes by affirming that the Buddha's path is **practical and works**—it leads to less reactivity and more peace in daily life. Stressful situations become opportunities to "flex the muscles" of wisdom. The Dhamma is accessible to everyone, though the teaching must be tailored to the individual's capacity (illustrated by the story of the monk who could only practice with a cleaning cloth mantra). The ultimate answer to "What's next?" is: **"Sing the chorus again."** Keep practicing, keep refining, and keep walking the same noble path with increasing depth and clarity.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses a rich tapestry of **metaphors, analogies, and stories** to explain complex Buddhist concepts, particularly focusing on meditation, the nature of reality (Anicca, Dukkha, Anattā), and the path of practice. Here is a breakdown of the primary ones:

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies:**

1.  **Anapanasati as the Immune System:** The practice of mindfulness of breathing (Anapanasati) is compared to **"the white blood cells of reality."** Its job is to investigate all mental phenomena, identify the unwholesome ("foe"), and eliminate it.
2.  **The Path as a Road/Fork:** The teaching of *Anicca, Dukkha, Anattā* (Impermanence, Suffering, Not-self) is framed as a **fork in the road (a "Y")**.
    *   **Anicca** is the base of the Y (the point of change).
    *   One fork leads to **Dukkha** (reacting with clinging/aversion, "this is me/mine").
    *   The other fork leads to **Anattā** (responding with wisdom, "not me, not mine").
    *   Our practice is about choosing the Anattā fork more quickly.
3.  **Cycles as Frequencies/Waves:** Impermanence (Anicca) and Samsara are explained through the metaphor of **waves and cycles of varying frequencies**.
    *   Ranges from ultra-fast (subatomic particles, picoseconds) to very slow (historical ages, 25,000-year precession of equinoxes).
    *   This includes **sound waves** (from inaudible low frequencies felt in the body to audible ranges) and **light waves** (visible spectrum, ultraviolet, radio waves).
    *   The point: Everything in existence is part of a cyclical process, and our labels (like "visible light") are arbitrary boundaries on a continuum.
4.  **Murphy's Law:** The Buddha's teaching on Anicca is described as a profound understanding of **"Murphy's Law"** (anything that can go wrong will go wrong). Anything that is compounded (*Sankhara*) will fall apart, especially under stress (Dukkha).
5.  **The Balloon and String:** To illustrate non-clinging, the mind is compared to a **balloon with a string**. The string alone is harmless. **Clinging** is the **child holding the string**, thinking "this balloon is *mine*." Without the "clinger," there is no suffering.
6.  **Noble Elements vs. Compounds:** To distinguish between compounded phenomena (*Sankhara*) and the unconditioned (*Dhamma*), the speaker uses the scientific analogy of **"noble" (inert) gases like Argon** vs. reactive compounds.
    *   *Sankhara* are like reactive molecules that come together and fall apart.
    *   *Dhamma* (in its ultimate sense) includes noble, unchanging truths/realities, likened to the **four fundamental forces of physics** (strong/weak nuclear, electromagnetic, gravity) or the **Four Noble Truths** themselves.
7.  **Waking Up as Braking a Car:** The speed of spiritual progress (from stream-enterer to arahant) is compared to **how quickly you hit the brakes before a collision**.
    *   The sooner you see danger (unwholesome thoughts) and brake (apply wisdom), the less damage. An arahant doesn't need to brake because they're not heading for collision.
8.  **Practice as a Song with a Chorus:** The repetitive nature of Dhamma practice is compared to **learning and singing a song**.
    *   You have verses (specific situations) and a **constant chorus** (the core practice: "one wholesome thought after another").
    *   The answer to "what do I do next?" is: **"sing the second verse, same as the first"** or "sing the chorus again." It's steady, repetitive cultivation.
9.  **The Dentist:** Trusting the Dhamma process is compared to **trusting a dentist**. If you trust and let go ("this is just the body, let the expert do the work"), the experience is easier. If you don't trust and cling ("this is *my* tooth, I feel every probe"), you create extra suffering.

### **Stories & Anecdotes:**

1.  **The Monk with the Cloth:** A story of a monk who was unable to memorize scriptures. The Buddha gave him a simple practice: **use a cloth to clean his hands while repeating, "As I clean my hands with this cloth, I clean my mind."** This single, repetitive practice was enough for him to achieve liberation, illustrating that the Dhamma can be accessible to all, tailored to one's capacity.
2.  **The Alligator Swamp:** A well-known parable (presented as a cartoon caption) is cited: **"When you're up to your hips in alligators, it's hard to remember your original intention was to drain the swamp."** This illustrates how organizations (like the Red Cross) or individuals can lose sight of their original wholesome goal (draining the swamp/draining suffering) and become preoccupied with maintaining themselves (fighting alligators).
3.  **The Escalating Argument:** A story of a **husband and wife arguing**. The husband, just before violence, slams the door and leaves. This is presented as a moment of "waking up"—late, but wiser than staying. It illustrates the stages of awakening: how quickly can we disengage from unwholesome states?
4.  **Bees and Flowers:** A scientific anecdote about how **bees see ultraviolet light**. Flowers visited by bees change color in the UV spectrum, guiding other bees. Humans, blind to this frequency, would destroy the field. This story supports the "cycles/frequencies" metaphor, showing that our perception is limited to a narrow band of reality's vast spectrum.
5.  **Historical Cycles of Technology:** References to **the invention of writing, the Gutenberg press, and the internet** as examples of long-term cycles that introduce upheaval (unwholesomeness) but gradually move toward purification and wisdom as society learns to use them skillfully.

### **Key Symbolic Frameworks:**

*   **The Four Signs of an Arahant:** Described as dismantling a fortress of self:
    1.  **Fill in the moat:** Remove boundaries and defenses.
    2.  **Set down the weapons:** No need for physical or verbal aggression/defense.
    3.  **Lower the banner:** Stop identifying with any group, flag, or ideology (including "Buddhist").
    4.  **Unlock the door:** Cultivate *amor fati*—a loving, open-hearted welcome to whatever fate brings each moment.
*   **The Church Lady:** A stereotype used as a story to represent well-intentioned but unwise people who cause suffering because they are unable to see the *Dukkha* they create, being attached to their view of "fixing" things.

These metaphors and stories serve to ground abstract Buddhist philosophy in tangible, modern, and often scientific terms, making the path of practice seem accessible, logical, and immediately relevant to everyday life and mental experience.
