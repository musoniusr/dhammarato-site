### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, so this is Saturday morning, uh, the 16th of November, uh, 2024. The world has not fallen apart since last week. It still seems to be about the way that it was, all built upon attitudes. That in fact, your world is your own personal attitude. That there is no great big wide wonderful world out there, that all of your world is actually local according to what you have as senses. Now we can say that the web is actually an extension of the senses, but what you hear on the world is mostly just people's attitudes, people's beliefs, and that you could say then that culture is sort of like the sum total or a kind of a collective consciousness, or perhaps even collective Kamma in the sense of collective action based upon a common belief system that we have as a culture, but everybody doesn't live in that. What they live in is their own personal culture. Now, to get started, we always go back to what the Buddha said in the sense that he says he only teaches one thing. And that is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. He only teaches one thing, and yet look how full of beliefs, etc., culture is. It's absolutely chock-a-block full of nonsense, beliefs, wants, projections, etc. And that the way to straighten out the world is to straighten it out between your ears, which basically means that when things are straight in your own mind, you recognize what a tangled web culture is, and it's best to not to bother with it too much. That in fact, what we're really looking for when we talk about the teaching of the Buddha, that dukkha, dukkha, Nirodha, actually means to see the dukkha and to get out of its way. Don't go messing with that stuff. Because when we mess with it, we get it all over us. And when we get it all over us, we can't tell the difference between that stuff and who we actually are. But in fact, this is the whole point of the teaching of the Buddha, is to be able to see how much of what we thought we were is not actually who we are. That most of what we think we are is just something that was borrowed from someplace else, some part of the culture that we live in. And so since the American election last week, we have a whole big wad of people with various points of view. And the reality is, is that nobody knows the future. Nobody knows. The real question is, is can you be satisfied? Can you be happy right now, which is the Nirodha part, to get rid of the Dukkha. Let it rot. Funny, that's a word that is translated from the Chinese. I don't know, does anybody know the Chinese word for let it rot? But that's the way that the young people in China are beginning to see, is that their government is so messed up, the best thing to do is just to ignore it completely. They also had before that lying flat, and that's what I've been doing a lot of. It's just laying flat. So when we look at the teaching of the Buddha in the sense of Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, What he actually is saying in a language that we can understand is life is actually— your life is actually a bunch of borrowed crap, the Dukkha. And that Dukkha is dissatisfying. I mean, after this election, look how dissatisfied so many, many millions of people are dissatisfied. Trump isn't getting his way. Nobody wants him to have his way. The Republicans are broken apart. The Democrats are broken apart. Voters who voted for Trump have voter's remorse, all kinds of things. But the one common thread with all of that is look at how disappointed and dissatisfied people are. Do you think that that's new? Nick, welcome, glad to see you. Do you think that dissatisfaction that permeates the culture is new?

**Speaker B:** No, it's been going on for decades and centuries, right?

**Speaker A:** It's been going on for more than centuries. And in fact, that's culture is collective dissatisfaction. And we want to make things better, we're dissatisfied the way that we are. A good example of that is technology. We as humans have developed technology because we were dissatisfied with the lack of technology, and so we manufactured technology. Well, guess what? Before we had any recording devices, before we had any microphones, before we had any cameras, people were dissatisfied. They couldn't decide on things. In fact, the story is, is that there was a huge, huge problem in the United States that happened before, during, and after the Civil War. And the story is, are racehorses ever completely in the air, or do the racehorses, each one of them, always have at least one foot on the ground? And people had duels about that. It was big in the newspapers. And so after the camera was invented, someone took a whole string of cameras, put each one of them on a fence post along the route where the horses were traveling with tripwires so that they could take a whole bunch of photos to see if they could prove to find the horse completely in the air. I don't ever know, I don't remember what the outcome to that was, but we can say that part of the development of cameras, especially even into movie cameras, was to solve that problem. And after it was solved, it didn't matter. I think they settled a bunch of debt. A whole lot of money was transferred. A whole lot of people were unhappy. But that must have been because they did catch at least one photo of a horse being completely off the ground, because having a whole series of photos of the horse with one foot on the ground doesn't prove anything. That's correct.

**Speaker C:** The result was that it was proven that the horse was suspended in the air.

**Speaker A:** It must have been because they don't talk about it anymore. They must have been. They must have been able to get one photo of the horse in the air completely. So The point then is, is that look how far technology has come, all the way from taking photos, getting microphones, recording sound, recording sights, putting them together, having motion pictures, going to the theater to see a motion picture. Then they developed television, but in the beginning days they didn't have any way of recording it because it was too much data. So every television broadcast was live. And then somebody came up with a video recorder. That was in the 1950s, after they had developed tape. Then they had VCRs on the market in the '70s, and since then we've had CDs, DVDs, then we had everything go digital. And guess what? People are now more dissatisfied, or at least just as dissatisfied as they were before the cameras. So cameras haven't solved anything. If anything, cameras, etc., with all this technology, has sort of spread a thin layer of a veneer of consistency across the cultures, so that we know a whole lot more information now, but as a culture, we're just as dissatisfied as we've always been. How many of you here have benefited from technology? Everybody says, oh, I benefited from technology. How many people have been cured of dissatisfaction because of technology? Nobody. And yet the Buddha had that problem solved 2,500 years ago. There was no Buddhaphone back then. But they didn't need technology at all. We didn't need culture at all. If that's the case, then we can say that we do not need technology today, that in fact our technology has kept us more informed, closer to culture, and we're still dissatisfied. If anything, we've just got more things to be dissatisfied about. If you didn't have a cell phone and you wanted to talk to your grandmother, you're dissatisfied you can't talk to her. Now that you've got a cell phone, look how many apps you've got on that cell phone, and you're dissatisfied with every one of them. So in fact, the technology is increasing. Our dissatisfaction. So the question is, how can we come out of that dissatisfaction into a state of satisfaction? The answer to that is stop looking on the outside for solutions to our problems and go inside. You probably heard me say that when people ask me what book that they should read, a Buddhist book, I suppose. Consistently, the answer is read the book between your ears, which is exactly what the Buddha was talking about in the sense of.

**Speaker D:** Looking.

**Speaker A:** Now, one of the questions that I've heard this morning is how do we How do we, let us say, develop a practice so that we actually have the motivation? And the answer to that is motivation is actually a skill that needs to be developed. And that the development of it has to do with our ability to see Dukkha. Now in the AA, the Alcoholics Anonymous, one of the things that they mention or talk about is people need to hit rock bottom. Only when an alcoholic reaches rock bottom does he recognize he's got to make a change. How many of you have heard that? Okay, so what we need to do then is develop the mentality or to develop the thought of recognizing that our dissatisfactions are cumulative, and it winds up that we bounce on our own rock bottom on a regular basis. We've just gotten used to being at rock bottom. And so when we can begin to look at what we're doing, we can see the Dukkha, and that seeing of the Dukkha then will be the motivation that we need in order to change. And so looking, remembering to look and to see, and to see clearly, these are skills that need to be developed. I had a long conversation on Skype with Jesus about kusala and akusala. Now, in the Pali, kusala is often translated, especially by Bhikkhu Bodhi, as wholesome and unwholesome, and we use that word quite a lot. But according to Jesus, Arhat Anicca translates kusala as skillful. Now, one of the qualities of kusala as a grass— there's actually a district of India called Kusala. I guess they have a lot of kusala grass there. But kusala grass is a very big, tough grass. Here in Thailand, we have commonly lemongrass. Now, that lemongrass can grow 4 or 5 feet high as a great big bush. And it is best if you don't know what you're doing to stay away from it. But it takes skill to be able to manage that lemongrass. Now, you can in fact pound the leaves and actually have a drink. But if you unmindfully walk right into it, you're going to be full of scratches, maybe even some scrapes or some deeper cuts, because the leaves on that plant have spines that are sharp like a paper cut. Well, Kusala is 10 times that. I've seen Kusala grass in India. I haven't seen it much in Thailand. But in the time of the Buddha, they would use this kusala grass, they would cut it and dry it and flatten it with a press and then use it as a kitchen utensil, a kitchen knife. Now, going back to— there's two ways of looking at it. One is, is that using it as a knife One can say, I can cut this thing open. And I use the word diagnostic. I was an engineer, and so we use diagnostic tools and diagnostic software and diagnosis. What we mean by diagnosis, the word diag is Greek for cutting, opening things up. And the word gnosis, I guess everybody knows that, is to know. Our word knowledge and knowing comes from gnosis. And so in that skillful way, we can cut things open. Like somebody without teeth can't eat an apple, but you can take a kusala grass, cut that apple open, and now the guy with no teeth can eat the smaller pieces. So we have it in two different ways. And one is the skill of not harming oneself while working with knives. And the other one is the skill of what we can do with the knife. And so this is what we come down to, is wholesome kinds of thought means that we have to really look at and dig deeper into the kinds of thoughts that we have. To recognize that most of the thoughts that we have are in fact dissatisfying. That if you have a thought about the future, "Oh, I've got to go to the store," if you investigate that thought and cut it open and recognize what's going on, it's because you're dissatisfied. If you have thoughts about going swimming, if you have thoughts about going to the beach, if you have thoughts about working out, If you cut that thought open, at the heart of it is going to be that you're not satisfied with this present moment. And so this is where we have to start to develop the skill of remembering to look at every thought one by one by one. Now, we don't need any particular posture. We don't need any particular cushion. We don't need a particular chair. We don't need a particular meditation hall to do this. We certainly do not need a Buddha Rupa or a monk sitting on a dais in front of us. We don't need the candles. We don't need the incense. We don't need the flowers, especially the lotus. What we need to do is to look. Now we can use those things as anchors. In fact, just yesterday I had a call with Dylan who is going to go to a Goenka retreat. And that one of the things that I remember about the Goenka retreats— done quite a lot of them— was that people go into the Goenka retreat and if they manage to finish that retreat, Their only joy of the retreat is when it's over. But they don't gain any joy. Why is that? It's because they're looking at the form. And most of the people during the hour of sitting is waiting for the bell to ring. They're not actually investigating their mind. So going on a retreat has the quality of getting away from the culture completely But almost everyone, when they go into seclusion like that, recognize if they look that they brought the culture with them. And all they do is just rehash culture. An example of that is on the first or second day, everybody is remembering how they got to the retreat. The middle of the retreat, They begin to have nothing to think about, and so they go way back in the deep past or all the way into the future. And then as the retreat begins to come close to being over, and now everybody is planning on what they're going to do the day after the retreat. And during that retreat, very few people are in that retreat in the sense of being here right now. So that they can look at the kind of thoughts that they have. So retreats and sitting on the floor in a form of what they would call meditation is not what the Buddha taught. He didn't say, oh, sign up for a Goenka retreat, go to Spirit Rock. What he said was, go to the forest, go to the foot of a tree, go to an empty hut, go to a pile of straw, And what he is talking about there is to get away from the culture, to put that cell phone down and to sit there and start looking at what your thoughts are. Because only by seeing how dissatisfied, dissatisfying those thoughts are, if we can see that, that will give us the motivation to practice more, to come out of those unwholesome, dissatisfying, unskillful thoughts. But we are in such a habit of having one unwholesome thought after another, after another, after another, and we get used to it, and we think, oh well, it's not so bad, everything is kind of okay. And then we'll have another unwholesome thought about, oh, I've got to fix the car 'Oh wow, those politicians are terrible,' or 'Oh no, they're going to do something really bad.' We don't even recognize that we're making that shit up, that we don't know what the politicians are going to do. We don't know what they're going to do to each other. They don't— you don't know what the voters are going to do. You don't know the future. The Buddha actually talks about that in Sutta number 131 in the Majjhima Nikaya. When he's talking about that now, today, right here in front of us, this is the time that we need to have to pay attention to what we're thinking. That will give us the motivation to continue to do it. It will also, by doing it some, will begin to develop the skills so that we don't cut ourselves on the kusalas of our own mind. And this is why the Buddha recommends, let's start having wholesome thoughts. Now, when I use the word wholesome, I'm actually looking at the Anapanasati Sutra, where the Buddha talks about it not in the sense of thoughts, but in the sense of our attitude. Let's gladden the mind. Let's brighten the mind. Let's tell ourselves everything is actually okay. Right here, right now, and any time that you have a right here, right now, you can recognize it right here, right now, everything is kind of okay. So why don't we think about everything right now is okay, that we can let that skill develop. Everything is okay. Everything is satisfying. And if we forget, then the habits are going to come back. And the habits that we picked up were all the habits of the unwholesome. And so the reason why we want to practice is because the habits have already gotten set in to be having unwholesome thoughts. So we have to remember over and over and over again to remember to look at the kind of thoughts that you're having. This is the whole practice, is to remember to look at what you're thinking, to remember to look at your attitude. Almost everyone is born with and raised on a victim's mentality. And look how many things that you're a victim to. You're a victim to things like police. You're a victim to the IRS. You're a victim to the religion. You're in— you're, uh, a victim of the school. You're a victim of the teacher. You're a victim of the bully at school. You're a victim of the law system. How many things are you a victim to? As opposed to how many things are you champion of? Are you a champion of your own thoughts? Are you a champion of your own mind? Are you a champion of this moment? So begin to see that we are in fact in the habit of being a victim And that victim's mentality, a dark mentality, is our habit, and we've gotten used to it. And so this is why we have to begin to investigate. This is the important point about the investigation, is to cut that stuff apart, look at it, and recognizing, wow, what a small A foul-smelling thought, that is. Everything is just foul-smelling because it's rotting in the mind and has been for years. I need this, I want that, I've got to get this, I've got to get that degree, I've got to get this grade, I've got to get rid of the bully, I've got to do this, I've got to do that. And all of that 'I've gotta' is a victim's mentality. You feel oppressed by all of that stuff from culture. The culture itself weighs upon people in the culture. It's heavy. But if we can remember that it's heavy, remember to look at all of my thoughts about culture, and then we can do something about it. Once we cut that stuff open and see what's in there, we can discard it. We can throw it out. Now, when I say throw it out, I'm actually talking about an activity. You've heard in Western Buddhism they talk about letting go. Well, guess what? Things don't let go and they're gone. Things cling. It's not just that we cling to those things with a tight fist, it's that those things cling to the fist. So we have to shake them off, we have to throw them off, we have to throw that thought out, we have to take the right noble effort to remove it. So maybe relinquishment is not a strong enough word. What would be the opposite of clinging? Because relinquishment is not the opposite of clinging. So we naturally need to take the right noble effort to remove stuff, to take out the trash. So I'll give you a little example of what I'm talking about there. Mom tells her teenage son to take out the trash in the kitchen, and he reluctantly does it. It's his job, it's his duty. He hasn't done his duty. Mom is unhappy because there's so much trash piling up in the kitchen, and so he takes it out because he's told to take it out, and he does it begrudgingly. And that trash is heavy. But then something happens the next week or so, and he remembers that. And he remembers because he's beginning to practice the teaching of the Buddha to recognize how unhappy he was when he was doing his duty to take out the trash. And so now, before mom comes home, he picks up that trash and happily carries it out. This is the way that we want to start looking at it. Instead of begrudgingly taking out our trash, be happy that we— oh yeah, I'm like it when the kitchen is clean. I really like it when my mom doesn't have to fuss at me to do my duty. That in fact, mom is really happy that her son has actually done his duty without him being prodded. And so this is the way that we're going also. Instead of having the parent in the mind, oh, you should practice Anapanasati, you should practice having wholesome thoughts, and that's the stage that everybody goes through, we make it a rule. And then we rebel against the rule. So even when we're practicing, we do it begrudgingly. But when we can actually see what a filthy mess our mind is, then we can then, with right noble effort, actually gain that attitude change of, "Well, I can do this. I can throw that stuff out." So this is the way that we're going to learn to practice, is to start changing our attitude along with changing our thoughts. So that we can begin also to change our feelings. Most people are raised in this culture that your feelings are out of control. It's actually built into the language when we say, "Oh, I am depressed, I am frustrated, I am sorrowful, I am angry." What that means is that we can't tell the difference between who we really are and the feeling that is there. When we begin to look, when we begin to cut things open, we can recognize, "Oh, the anger is there, but that's not me." If we could cut that stuff open and recognize that the anger is there but it's not me, that is actually then motivation to stop that anger. But if we see anger in the sense of, "Oh, I am angry and I shouldn't be," now we're adding an extra layer of Dukkha to it. And it's harder to change, because we don't see the anger as Dukkha, we see the anger as me. So if you have the thought of, "I am frustrated," or, "I am angry," Cut that open. Open that stuff up to recognize that you are not your feelings, that you do have some control over your feelings. You can feel, in fact, the way you want to feel. And if you have the right attitude, it's easy enough to change your feelings. And the attitude is, hey, I don't have to feel that way. I can feel the way I want to. Yeah, the computer broke. Yeah, the cell phone broke. But I am not the cell phone. Wow, I'm really glad that I'm not the cell phone, because the cell phone just broke. Also, many people who don't have a cell phone that breaks, they're worried about their cell phone breaking. Oh, well, what if? What if this goes bad? What if that goes bad? But if we're practicing correctly, we'll cut that thought open and recognize that that thought is not real. It's a what-if. What if this goes wrong? What if that goes wrong? The fact is, everything is already okay. And so this is the real teaching of the Buddha. The real teaching of the Buddha, this Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, really is established in the fact is, can you cut those thoughts open and see what's in there and see the Dukkha, to see your own dissatisfaction? Because being able to see your own dissatisfaction will begin to change your motivation. And your motivation would be to come out of your victim's position, come out of your Dukkha, come into a winner's position, come into the thought pattern of I can handle this, I'm just fine. But we have to practice that over and over and over and over again. Now here's one of the things that's marvelous about the teaching of the Buddha, that when you can see, when you can cut that thought open, when you can see your attitude under it, when you can see those feelings and see the Dukkha, you can change it right then and there. You can throw that thought out, you can throw that culture out, you can end everything right then and there for a short time, for a short time, everything is already okay. That fulfills the entire teaching of the Buddha. You could do that immediately. There is no such thing as progress. It's a lot more like a light switch than it is a dimmer. Oh, I'm a little bit enlightened is a much better way of saying that right now I'm enlightened. 'Right now, I don't have a worry in the world. Right now, I've got a winner's attitude.' But recognize that that's not going to last very long because of the habits. And so we have to do it again and again and again. And many people will say, 'Oh, well, I've done it 3 or 4 times now. I brightened my mind, I gladdened my mind, and now it's right back into the Dukkha.' me. Well, that's just your habit. The question is, can you keep looking? The question is, can you never mind? In fact, I'm really glad that I saw that Dukkha. Have that attitude of, oh wow, I'm really glad I saw that because now I don't have to think about it. Wow, I'm glad I caught myself thinking about George Bush. Now I don't have to think about him. Well, I'm glad I had a thought. I can see that thought about Putin, and so I can throw Putin out of my mind. And wow, right now I'm free from him. So look at the instantaneous as being your goal. Right here, right now, throw those unwholesome thoughts out one at a time. Another one, another one, another one. And pretty soon, you begin to develop the skill of being able to see the Dukkha. You can begin to develop the skill to remember to look. You can develop the skill of actively throwing it out, and that's an important one, the development of the skill of Right Noble Effort. And when you do that over and over and over and over and over again, a new skill begins to develop, and that is having right and noble attitude, or right noble intention, of, hey, I can change. I know I can change because look how many times I have changed. Not look at the tens of hundreds and millions of times that I didn't change. Look at the fact that in 25 times I have changed. If I can change 25 times, I can change 26. And so that begins to change our attitude. And then something important happens. It's so important that the Buddha calls it— this is the first knowledge. The first knowledge is when the student understands that no matter how obstructed the mind gets, no matter how much hindrances, no matter how much Dukkha, is in the mind, we can throw that stuff out and come back to the reality of the present moment. And so this is an attitude to develop, that you can do this, you can throw that stuff out. And then we begin to get elated. Whoopi, I can do this! Wow! I don't have to have any more Dukkha. All I have to do is remember to look and to see the Dukkha and to throw it out. I can do this. And so this is the attitude that we begin to develop, the attitude of a winner, the attitude of I can control the way I feel. And in fact, it's not me that has the feelings. The feelings are just there because of habits. That I am not my feelings. I am not my victim's attitude. I am not any of that stuff. This is what the Buddha means by Anatta, that you're not stuck in it. This is what Christianity and Hinduism and many religions think of as a soul or a nut that's deep inside and you can't change it, you can't fix it. And in fact, the Hindus say it's an accumulation of all of your old actions, and you can't change the past. But guess what? If you use that kusala, if you use that skill, if you use that wholesomeness, if you use that diagnosis, you can cut that right to the core and recognize that this is just a thought that I'm having now. It's got no substance to it. And I can throw that out. So this is the real practice, is over and over and over and over again we keep throwing that stuff out. Over and over and over again we keep throwing that stuff out until we develop the attitude of I can do this. And that's the very first knowledge that is noble. That knowledge is a factor of the path itself. This is what the Buddha marks as the beginning of one's noble path. It's not quite Srotapanna, but it's the first step of Srotapanna, is having that attitude that I can do this. I can throw those unwholesome thoughts out of the mind. I can come back to reality. 'Let me do it right now.' And so that's far enough that we need to do, because the one point that I want to instill upon the group is that you have to be able to see the Dukkha as Dukkha. You have to look, you have to cut that stuff open to see that it's Dukkha, because seeing that it's Dukkha, seeing that you're at rock bottom right this very moment, will be the motivation you need to make that change. And if you change over and over and over and over again, you keep changing and keep changing, you will slowly develop the attitude of I can do this, that I am not a victim of my own circumstances, I'm not a victim of my own feelings, I'm not a victim of my attitude. I'm not even a victim of my thoughts, that I can change. This is why the Eightfold Noble Path, I find it— we were talking about earlier about Western Buddhism, this is probably the most important thing that's missing in Western Buddhism, because we have the attitude of Capitalism. We have the attitude of, oh, I can't change by myself, I need help, I need a therapist, I need a guru, I need a teacher, I need, I need, I need, I need. And the right noble attitude is you don't need anything other than to see what you're doing and make a change to it. That nobody can fix you, only you can fix you, and you can fix you by stop being what you thought was you and start being the you that you want to be. So Karuna, you had your hand up. Go ahead.

**Speaker D:** Well, can you hear me?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker D:** Well, my thing was, I thought, can we assume that at any moment we are actually, especially at the beginning, someone like me, that most of the time we are in Dukkha? Because sometimes I don't see it like Dukkha, but I'm just thinking about things. You know, I'm just thinking about things and I don't want to change them because I'm like, okay, this is maybe not Dukkha, but actually, as you said, if we really cut everything from moment to moment, then we will see, okay, most of the time it is Dukkha and it doesn't need to be something very big like suffering or something like fear or anger. But just from moment to moment, from moment to moment, most of the time I'm in— yeah, I'm in Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's exactly right. To recognize that moment by moment by moment, your average ordinary state is at a, let us say, a low-level rumble of Dukkha. Yeah, it's there with every thought. Every thought is based upon some kind of satisfaction, dissatisfaction. And if we can cut that open and see and find that dissatisfaction, see that Dukkha in there, now we have an opportunity to change it. If we don't look and we don't see, we don't have a chance, we don't have a choice. And so this is why we have to keep looking and keep looking and keep looking. And pretty soon you're getting the skill of being able to see it, so that in the beginning, a lot of the stuff that we thought was wholesome, upon a skill development, we recognize that no, that's not wholesome. Thinking about the future, for instance, thinking about what we're going to do, that's unskillful. Instead of just saying, wow, right now I don't have to do any of that. Everything is right now okay. Wow, what a relief it is. But that's actually— would be the goal that you could have, would be to sigh and relax and say, wow, everything is okay. And practice that over and over and over again, and pretty soon you gain that insight, that Vipassana of, well, you know something, everything really is okay. I have seen it okay enough now that I'm beginning to recognize that everything is already okay.

**Speaker D:** You know, when thinking that, actually also that thought makes me a little bit afraid, what I'm thinking. Let's say if I'm really okay with everything being like it is, If I'm really, really happy, will I have then motivation to do something? Because sometimes I make myself angry, I listen to war music, you know, I go in the shower, war music, boom, boom, boom, I motivate myself to make myself angry to do something. It is very strange, but to— and I'm now thinking, what if I'm really happy, will I then make anything out of my life? You know, now I'm trying to make money, I'm trying to build a business, I'm trying to do, you know, I'm trying to do to make something out of my life? And if I'm really happy, will I have any motivation to do anything?

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly. Why are you so motivated with Dukkha that you're out there building a business and building this and building that? And all of that is based upon dissatisfaction. That in fact, one of the things that I'll mention now is that in All religions, they— like Christianity has a heaven and a hell and maybe a purgatory, which is just the same as hell, it's just with lower temperature. And Hinduism has this idea of good actions lead to good results and bad actions lead to bad results. But the Buddha He examined that, and recognized that most action is in fact mixed. It's mixed with good and mixed with bad; every cloud has a silver lining. That people who really hate Trump, for instance, are really happy to see how many people hate him. So, if we can see that fact that almost all of our action is mixed, then we can go to the fourth kind of Kamma, which is neither one. It's not good, it's not bad, it just is. And that kind of action leads to the end of action. For instance, if you have a splinter in your foot and you're thinking about it, you'll probably go get a knife and start start digging into that foot. But if you're sitting just happily and comfortably without any pressure on that foot, the foot doesn't bother. And because of that, we don't do anything. Now, when it starts to defester, it begins to throb, then we'll do something about it. But often splinters, especially small ones, will work their way out. We didn't have to do anything. Little cuts will heal all by themselves. But when we have 1,000 cuts, we think that, oh, we've got to go do something, I got to go start a business. And so the real goal then of Buddhism is not really a goal, it's just the result of When you do things because it's pleasurable right here, right now, and you don't go around harming other people, you're not going around harming yourself, and you're not looking for some reward, and everything is just okay and everything is just satisfying, you begin to not do so much. You come out of the doing. It's the culture that teaches you you got to go do something because things are so screwed up. People who go on a protest march, whatever they're protesting, they go on that protest march because they're all worked up. And when they get to the protest march, they get even more worked up. And then the police come in and start bashing people around, shooting them with rubber bullets, and people get even more worked up. Better not to go. Better to say, hey, I'd better stay away from that rally. Just don't go. Okay, so that's an example right there. If we stop going to rallies, political rallies, then we don't think about politics so much and everything becomes kind of okay. We don't do so much. I would highly recommend that any time that you feel like you got to go do something, is to cut that thought open and recognize, maybe I don't have to do it. Maybe it's not that important. Maybe I can sit here. Wow, what a relief it is I don't have to go to the bank. And so the real issue then is that when we get to the point of not having anything to do. Isn't that marvelous? When we get to the point that we don't have to do anything, guess what? We don't have to do anything. We don't do anything. We can just relax and say, my, how marvelous things are right now.

**Speaker D:** I'm thinking about my dogs.

**Speaker A:** I have two dogs, you know, and.

**Speaker D:** Most of times they are also just Yeah, doing nothing, be nothing, and just being happy and sleeping, eating, running, sometimes fighting.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. We've got two cats here at the house and they spend most of their time snuggling with each other and just chilling out, stretching. But humans, we're working, what, 18 hours a day, 7, 6 days a week. Why do we do that? Two reasons: one is because we want something we don't have, and two, we've made a habit of it. So examine those habits, examine those desires, recognize that we really probably don't need a new cell phone. The old one is good enough. And if I think about I want a new cell phone, guess what? Right then and there, I'm dissatisfied. So this is the teaching for today. This is our topic, is to learn develop the skill of looking at the kind of thoughts that we have, to cut them open, to see the Dukkha. Because if we can see the Dukkha, the motivation will be there to throw that Dukkha out. And once you've thrown that Dukkha out, there's nothing left to do in that particular moment. That's all there was to it. Well, I'm okay right now. The issue is we've got this habit of wanting something, and so those new— those old thoughts will start to recur. Can you catch that when it does recur? Can you be skillful? Can you be on your mental toes to look at that stuff? This is what we mean by skillful or kusala. Diagnose, look at what's going on. See the Dukkha clearly. Because if we can see it clearly, that will be the motivation to change it. And you've seen me before, you recognize I just have the same talk over and over and over again. It's the same talk because I'm trying to get you guys to motivate to look at what you're doing. Because if you really see what you're doing, you'll stop doing it. So does anybody have any questions? Ivan, what you up to, friend?

**Speaker E:** Oh, uh, hi, Dhammarato. I was just thinking about the Goenka meditation that you're talking about, because I've been to one recently and I find it funny how they talk about like— like this, like, well, they're talking about like results, like, you know, you have to sit for weeks or years before you can see progress. And it really got me scratching my head. No, that's just my thinking out loud thoughts because I find it We are.

**Speaker A:** But yeah, you can make that progress right here, right now. In fact, the only thing that we can call progress is can you change right now. That's your progress, right then and there. But the Anicca method, they don't teach that.

**Speaker E:** Uh, yeah, that's why I find it funny. But yeah, that's all.

**Speaker A:** Nick, do you have any comments?

**Speaker B:** No, I mean, I just think it's so interesting, you know, in your lineage, like just that idea of bringing joy and satisfaction in the present moment and throwing out Dukkha, because you can go on to like places like r/StreamEntry on Reddit and talk about these things and everyone wants to argue with you about it. Like, oh, that's not what it says in the suttas, blah blah blah, you know. It's funny because it just— it's so obvious to me. I mean, it took a long time for me to like see something so simple that you've been teaching and have it just all click, and especially happen in the last year. Um, but it's just It's fascinating that there's so many different interpretations of the Buddhist teaching, but now I just see it so clearly. It's like, of course, of course. Yes.

**Speaker A:** Well, you'd be surprised at how many rat holes, sinkholes, cesspools, thickets, etc. people wind themselves up to when you have the blind leading the blind. And I'm very, very grateful to Ajahn Po and Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, sometimes intentionally leading me into a thicket, just so they could laugh at me and say, "Wake up! Look at what you're doing!" So Patrick, do you have anything to say? How about you, Michael Belmod Smith? No, I don't have anything to say. This was a great talk. Thank you, Dhammarato. All right, how about you, Edward? How about you, Lars? You got anything to say? How about you, Christopher? I'm all good, better now even. So good to see everybody. See you next time. All right, so Mikey, why don't we take this thing home?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, thank you everyone for being here today. It's wonderful to see so many people here in Sangha. Dhammarato has said that he's going to start taking one-on-one calls again. So if you're watching this on YouTube, go ahead and join our one-on-one Skype group for arranging a Dhamma call with either Dhammarato or one of our seasoned practitioners. You can also sign up for opensanghafoundation.org where we've got a huge database of wats and other teachers and friends that you can make as well. And yeah, join our Skype groups, our Discord, Come be a part of Sangha. It's worthwhile.

**Speaker A:** Yes, we didn't talk about Sangha today. We were talking more about seclusion and seeing what you're doing. But Sangha really is all about making friends with those who are already practicing correctly so that you, let us say, work together to make a stew. And so we help one another so that if somebody comes up with an unwholesome thought, everybody laughs.

**Speaker C:** Yes, the ancient stew of the Buddha-Dharma. All right, good to see everyone. Take care.

**Speaker A:** All right, thank you so much. We'll see you. Appreciate it. Thank you, everyone.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points and themes discussed by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with the Sangha:

### **Core Message:**
The path to freedom from suffering (*dukkha*) is not found in external culture, technology, or political events, but by investigating and purifying your own mind. True practice is an immediate, internal act of seeing dissatisfaction and choosing to drop it.

### **Main Themes & Teachings:**

1.  **The World is Your Attitude:** Your personal reality is constructed from your own attitudes and senses. What we call "culture" or "the news" is largely a collective projection of dissatisfaction and beliefs. To straighten out your world, you must straighten out the mind "between your ears."

2.  **The Buddha's One Teaching:** The essence of the Buddha's teaching is *Dukkha* (suffering/discontent) and its cessation (*Nirodha*). Our task is to **see *dukkha* clearly and get out of its way**, not to get entangled in it.

3.  **Technology & Culture Amplify Dissatisfaction:** While technology (cameras, phones, the internet) promises solutions, it primarily spreads information and a veneer of connection without curing the underlying human condition of dissatisfaction. It often gives us *more* things to be dissatisfied about.

4.  **The Practice: Investigate & "Cut Open" Your Thoughts:**
    *   **Skillful Means (*Kusala*):** Practice is developing the **skill** to diagnose your mind. Like using a sharp blade of *kusala* grass, you must learn to "cut open" your thoughts to see what's inside.
    *   **Find the *Dukkha*:** At the heart of almost every thought—planning, worrying, remembering—is a subtle (or not-so-subtle) dissatisfaction with the present moment.
    *   **Seeing is Motivation:** Clearly seeing that a thought is rooted in *dukkha* provides the natural motivation to let it go. This is like an alcoholic needing to "hit rock bottom" to want to change; we must recognize our own "rock bottom" in daily discontent.

5.  **From Victim to Champion:**
    *   We are conditioned into a **"victim mentality"**—feeling oppressed by culture, politics, duties, and our own feelings.
    *   The practice is to shift to a **"winner's attitude"** or "champion of your mind." Recognize: "I am not my feelings. I am not my thoughts. I can change this."
    *   This involves **active removal**, not passive "letting go." You must "throw out" or "shake off" unwholesome thoughts with Right Effort.

6.  **Immediate Change, Not Gradual Progress:**
    *   Enlightenment or peace is compared to a **light switch, not a dimmer**. You can choose *right now* to drop a thought and experience that "everything is already okay."
    *   The habit of *dukkha* is strong, so you will have to do this **over and over again**. The goal is to develop the skill and the confidence that "I can do this."
    *   **The First Noble Knowledge:** The pivotal insight is realizing that **no matter how obstructed the mind gets, you can always throw out the *dukkha* and return to the peace of the present moment.** This confidence is the true beginning of the path.

7.  **Practical Instructions:**
    *   **No Form Needed:** You don't need special cushions, rituals, statues, or retreats. Formal retreats often fail because people bring their cultural mental baggage with them.
    *   **The Method:** Wherever you are, **remember to look** at your thoughts and attitudes. Investigate them, see the *dukkha* within, and actively discard them. Then, gladden the mind by settling into the satisfaction that "right now, everything is okay."
    *   **Result of Success:** As you do this, you naturally **do less**. Action driven by dissatisfaction (like frantic business-building or political rage) falls away. You become more like a content animal—at ease, acting only when necessary.

### **Conclusion:**
The talk is a direct, pragmatic call to self-reliance. The solution to suffering is not in changing the world, acquiring things, or following external religious forms. It is in the relentless, gentle, and skillful personal work of auditing your own mind, seeing the pervasive *dukkha* in your thoughts, and choosing—again and again—to drop it and rest in the inherent okay-ness of the present moment. The Sangha's role is to support and encourage this individual practice through friendship and shared understanding.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors** and references a few key **stories** to illustrate the teachings.

### **Metaphors**

1.  **"The world between your ears" / "Read the book between your ears":** This is the central metaphor. It represents the mind as the primary locus of reality, experience, and the practice. The "outside world" of culture and events is secondary to the internal world of attitude and perception.

2.  **"A tangled web":** Used to describe culture and the mind filled with unexamined beliefs. It implies something complex, sticky, confusing, and easy to get caught in.

3.  **"Getting it all over us":** A metaphor for engaging with *dukkha* (suffering/dissatisfaction). It likens *dukkha* to a messy substance (like mud or tar) that we can become contaminated by and then mistake for our own identity.

4.  **"Cutting open" thoughts (Diagnosis):** This is the primary metaphor for investigation (*vipassanā*). Using the image of a knife (specifically *kusala* grass as a blade), it describes the act of analytically examining a thought to see its unsatisfying core. "Diagnosis" (from Greek *diagignōskein*, "to discern") is explicitly used to mean cutting open to know.

5.  **Kusala Grass as a Knife/Tool:** The grass is a multifaceted metaphor for skillfulness (*kusala*). It represents:
    *   A **tool** for investigation (to cut thoughts open).
    *   Something that requires **skill** to handle (to avoid getting cut).
    *   The potential for both benefit and harm based on how it's used.

6.  **"Taking out the trash":** A metaphor for the active effort of discarding unwholesome thoughts. It contrasts begrudging duty with the happy, proactive cleaning of one's own mind.

7.  **"A light switch, not a dimmer":** This metaphor counters the idea of gradual enlightenment. It suggests awakening is an instantaneous shift in perception ("everything is okay right now") that can be flipped on, rather than a slow brightening.

8.  **"Rock bottom":** Borrowed from addiction recovery, it describes the point of recognizing acute *dukkha* as the necessary motivation for change. The speaker adds that we often get used to living at a "low-level rumble" of rock bottom.

9.  **"Victim's mentality" vs. "Champion's attitude":** A contrasting metaphor for one's stance toward experience. Being a "victim" to culture, feelings, and thoughts is opposed to being a "champion" of one's own mind and the present moment.

10. **"A stew":** Used to describe the Sangha (spiritual community). It suggests a nourishing mixture where different ingredients (practitioners) blend together and support one another's development.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Racehorse Photography Debate:** A historical anecdote about the 19th-century debate over whether a galloping horse ever has all four feet off the ground. The speaker uses this to illustrate how technological advancement (the development of sequential photography/motion pictures) was driven by dissatisfaction and cultural dispute, and how solving the problem didn't alleviate underlying human dissatisfaction.

2.  **The Teenager Taking Out the Trash:** A parable-like story to illustrate the shift in attitude toward practice. The son moves from begrudgingly fulfilling an external duty to happily maintaining a clean internal space ("kitchen") out of understanding and care.

3.  **The Goenka Retreat Experience:** A generalized story based on the speaker's observation of many retreatants. It describes the common mental trajectory—rehashing the past, fantasizing about the future, and waiting for the bell—to illustrate how formal retreats often involve bringing one's cultural baggage along instead of truly secluding the mind.

4.  **Reference to "Lying Flat" and "Let It Rot" (*Bàilǎn*):** While not a full story, the speaker references these modern Chinese socio-cultural phrases (meaning withdrawal from societal pressures) as contemporary examples of the instinct to disengage from a dissatisfying "culture" or system.

**Overall Theme:** The metaphors and stories consistently work to **internalize the practice**. They turn abstract Buddhist concepts (*dukkha*, *kusala*, *vipassanā*, Right Effort) into tangible, everyday actions: cleaning, cutting, switching, reading a personal book, and discarding trash. The historical and modern anecdotes serve to demonstrate the perpetual and universal nature of dissatisfaction, arguing that the only true solution is an internal, attitudinal shift.
