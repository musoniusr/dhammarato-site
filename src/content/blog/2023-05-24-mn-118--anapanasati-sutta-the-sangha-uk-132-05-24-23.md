### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Up the recording there for the Wednesday Sangha call. It is the 24th of May, and so Scott's out on the Alps. He's out snowboarding, so just kind of doing a little taking over for a little bit, doing a little— gonna read a sutta. So actually, the one that I picked out today to read is the Anapanasati Sutta. So that should be quite fun to read and hopefully insightful. Yeah. So I'm going to read the Bhikkhu Bodhi translation. You can find it on Sutta Central. It's Majjhana Makkaya 118, Mindfulness of Breathing. And again, my pronunciation might be a little off on these, but we'll see. There goes through a lot of names in the beginning when it comes to the introductory section. It's just kind of like hyping up what the Buddha is about to lay down with the Anapanasati practice, with mindfulness of in and out breathing, or remembering in and out breathing. So let's start it off. So the introductory section: Thus I have heard, on one occasion the Blessed One was living in Savathi in the eastern park, in a palace of Marga, Marjuna's mother, together with many very well-known elder disciples, the Venerable Sariputta, the Venerable Maha Mogallana, the Venerable Maha Kasapa, the Venerable Maha Kamma, the Venerable Maha Katati, the Venerable Maha Panna, the Venerable Mahakonda, the Venerable Mudra, the Venerable Revata, the Venerable Ananda, and other very well-known elder disciples. Again, kind of messed around with the pronunciation a little bit there, but the main idea is that there's a lot of folks showing up to this gathering. It's a big event. So now on the occasion, elder Bhikkhus had been teaching and instructing new Bhikkhus. Some elder Bhikkhus had been teaching and instructing 10 Bhikkhus. Some elder Bhikkhus have been teaching and instructing 20, 30, 40 Bhikkhus, and the new Bhikkhus taught and instructed the elder Bhikkhus had achieved successful stages of high distinction. So it's kind of laying out again with the groups here that there's a lot of teaching going on and that these are actually, you know, people who are fairly established within their skills. Okay. On that occasion, the Anapanasati day of the 15th, on the full moon, Right of the Prajna cemetery, or ceremony, the Blessed One was seated in the open, surrounded by the Sangha of Bhikkhus. Then, surveying the silent Sangha of Bhikkhus, he addressed them thus: Bhikkhus, I am content with this progress. My mind is content with this progress. So arose still more energy to attain the unattained, to achieve the unachievable. To realize the unrealized. I shall wait here in Savati for the kunda full moon of the fourth month. Yeah, so this is kind of like on the Sabbath, if I'm gathering correctly, right? So this is kind of, again, it's sort of an event, a place where they can really kind of get together and sort of gather for a time-wise thing here. And also with that too, it's sort of again this hyping up like, hey, we're laying down some useful information here, you know, rouse that energy, get it going. All right. The Bhikkhus of the countryside heard the Blessed One will wait there at Savatthi for the full moon of the fourth moon, and the Bhikkhus of the countryside left in due course for Savatthi to see the Blessed One. The elder Bhikkhus still more intensively thought and instructed the new Bhikkhus. Some elder Bhikkhus taught, instructed. Okay. Or 10 Bhikkhus. Okay, I think I would just cover that. Yeah, on that occasion. Yeah, okay, actually I lost my place there. There we go. Bhikkhus, this assembly is free from prattle. This assembly is free from chatter. It consists purely of heartwood. Such is this Sangha of Bhikkhus. Such is this assembly. Such is an assembly worthy of gifts, of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, an incomparable field of merit for the world. Such is this Sangha of Bhikkhus. Such is this assembly, such an assembly that a small gift given to becomes great, a great gift, or becomes a great gift greater. Such is this Sangha of Bhikkhuni. Such is this assembly. Such is an assembly as is rare for the world to see. Such is the Sangha of Bhikkhus. Such is this assembly. Such is an assembly that would be worth journeying many leagues with travel bags to see. Such is the Sangha of Bhikkhus. Such is this assembly. And again, I keep kind of going back to this whole hyping up thing, but that really is sort of it, but also with it, it is showing like, hey, like this is really like worthwhile, like the Dharma here, this is a treasure and it is the gift that keeps on giving. So in this Sangha of Bhikkhus, there are Bhikkhus who are Arahants with taints destroyed, who have lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached their own goal, destroyed the fetters of being, and are completely liberated through final knowledge. Such Bhikkhus are there in this Sangha of Bhikkhus. In this Sangha of Bhikkhus there are Bhikkhus who have destroyed the five lower fetters, are due to reappear spontaneously in the pure abodes, and there attain final Nibbana. Without ever returning to this world. Such are Bhikkhus, or such Bhikkhus are there in this Sangha of Bhikkhus. So here it's kind of going through also sort of the stages of enlightenment as well. We have like Arahants, we have, I believe it's once for foreigners here, and then it goes down as well, right? So again, it's establishing that there are people of all different skill levels here. So yes, in this Sangha there are Bhikkhus who are Bhikkhus who, with the destruction of the three fetters— actually, wait, yep, I'm on the right one. Yes, in this Sangha there are Bhikkhus with the destruction of the three lower fetters, with the A tanhation of lust, hate, and delusion are once-returners, returning once to this world to make an end of suffering. Such are Bhikkhus there in this Sangha of Bhikkhus. So that's the once-returners there. And it's kind of even talking about the fetters here. Now we're on to, I believe, Sotapanna. Yeah, in this Sangha of Bhikkhus, there are Bhikkhus who, with the destruction of the three lower fetters, are stream-enterers, no longer subject to predation, bound for deliverance, headed for enlightenment. Such Bhikkhus are there in this Sangha of Bhikkhus. In this Sangha of Bhikkhus, there are Bhikkhus who abide devoted to the development of the four foundations of mindfulness. Such Bhikkhus are there in this Sangha of Bhikkhus. In this Sangha of Bhikkhus, there are Bhikkhus who abide devoted to the development of the four kinds of right striving, of the four spiritual powers, of the five faculties, of the five powers, of the seven enlightenment factors, of the Noble Eightfold Path. Such Bhikkhus are there in this Sangha of Bhikkhus. In this Sangha of Bhikkhus, there are Bhikkhus who abide devout to the development of loving-kindness, of compassion, of altruistic joy, of equanimity, of the meditation on foulness, of perception of impermanence. Such Bhikkhus are there in this Sangha of Bhikkhus. This, in the Sangha of Bhikkhus, there are Bhikkhus who abide devout to this development of mindfulness of breathing. So that's sort of the introduction there. And that last little bit is really covering the fact that there are people who are kind of practicing all different kinds of meditations that are kind of towards the Dhamma. But now we're going to come back to like the benefit and the fruit of like Anapanasati, which actually really does encompass all these other different practices. But like, it's like, hey, this is where we're kind of laying it down. But that was sort of like just an introduction to say, hey, this is an event. There's going to be some really dope knowledge coming up. So now we're getting into this part, mindfulness of breathing. Bhikkhus, when mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it is of great fruit and benefit. I'm going to repeat that again. Bhikkhus, when mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated, it is of great fruit and benefit. When mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated, it fulfills the four foundations of mindfulness. When the four foundations of mindfulness are developed and cultivated, they fulfill the seven enlightenment factors. When the 7 enlightenment factors are developed and cultivated, they fulfill true knowledge and deliverance. So the point here is Anapanasati can take you all the way. Anapanasati is the complete package, right? And it's of great fruit and benefit. So that's sort of the thing when folks sometimes, I mean, are like, oh, I don't know, you know, is there any benefit to this sort of practice? It's like, no. The Buddha says clearly there is benefit to practicing this. It's a great fruit and benefit. There's like, yeah, it's the stuff. Anyway, and Bhikkhus, and how, Bhikkhus, is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so that it is of great fruit and benefit? Here, Bhikkhus, gone to the forest, to the root of a tree, or an empty hut, sits down. Now this is a part that's been kind of added, having folded his legs crosswise. Now this is something that was kind of pointed out with the translation there. So again, it's pretty much talking about getting into seclusion. So I'll kind of go back over, just kind of pointing that out. Here Bhikkhus, having gone to the forest, to the root of a tree, to an empty hut, sits down, having folded his legs crosswise, his body erect, established mindfulness in front of him. Ever mindful, he breathes in. Ever mindful, he breathes out. So get into seclusion, and then here we go with the breath. And actually, now I believe it is getting into the— there are 16 steps. Now, before I get into the whole thing with there being 16 steps here, that kind of how it's laid out, 16 parts. One of the very helpful things that Dhammarato has pointed out is to view them perhaps a little bit more like dance steps rather than we have to go in sequential order starting from the[No speech] Srotapanna. So that's another thing. Now, I mean, I've practiced with it kind of both ways. Sometimes it can be helpful to go through it sort of in that way. But yeah, so I'm going to get started here. And yeah, no, it's actually really helpful though. I find like it's kind of going through the different skills as well that we can cultivate and maybe spend a little time focusing on. But you can kind of practice multiple of them sometimes in one breath as well. At least that's how I tend to practice. So we'll start with the first one. Breathing in long, he understands I breathe in long. Breathing out long, he understands I breathe out long. Breathing in short, he understands I breathe in short. Breathing out short, he understands I breathe out short. So that's like the first part of that. Just again, with that, there is Sati established. One knows they are breathing, right? And the in and out breath here is very helpful because it sort of directs us like, hey, we got to be here now in order to discern, is this an in or an out breath? So this is a really grounding thing to help us get back to being present here and now. And that's how we also can develop these skills. So moving along to the next step here. So there's the breathe out short. Yep. So, and there's the short breath and the long breath. So he trains thus, I breathe in experiencing the whole body and then added here is of breath. So it can kind of be taken both ways, the whole body of breath, but also the whole body. He trains thus, I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body of breath. He trains thus: I shall breathe in tranquilizing bodily formations. He breathes out thus— or he breathes— he trains thus: I breathe out tranquilizing bodily formations. So there is the first four. I broke it up a little bit here in terms of the paragraph because it kind of like It goes like it covers all of them within this in the first four. And those are all connected with the body, right? So this is like the first foundation of mindfulness, that of the body, right? And so there is the long breaths, there's the short breaths, and there is becoming aware of the whole body, right? So we become aware of the whole body, and then there's relaxing the body. The word used here is tranquilizing. Again, we can, we can use that, but it's pointing towards the calming of the body, right? So these are the first sort of 4 steps. Now we're going to move on to the second part here, which is the Vedana, the feeling aspect of it. So he trains himself thus: I breathe in experiencing rapture. He trains himself thus: I breathe out, experiencing rapture. He trains himself thus: I breathe in, experiencing pleasure. He trains himself thus: I breathe out, experiencing pleasure. He trains himself thus: I breathe in, experiencing mental formation. He trains himself thus: I breathe out, experiencing mental formation. He trains himself thus: I breathe in tranquilizing mental formation. He trains himself thus: I breathe out tranquilizing mental formation. So I can kind of go back over that there. I decided, hey, it might be better to just read the whole thing. But so this is kind of focused a little bit more on the Vedana. So the experiencing of the rapture, right, the first part. And so this is the fifth is actually the Piti. This is that feeling of joyful success, right? So this is the breathing in and experiencing that feeling of joyful success of being a winner, right? So this can be really helpful when we're practicing Anapanasati. What I find really helpful to bring this up is just again, just acknowledging this breath. This is successful enough. We're doing something like virtuous here. We're doing something beneficial here. Again, going back to Anapanasati, one practiced and cultivated, when developed, is of great fruit and benefit. So reminding ourselves of that, remembering that when we're practicing, as we breathe in and out, that can help to generate the Piti as well. And then if we also are practicing with those first steps, again, just being aware, knowing we're breathing in long and breathing in short, as well as the calming and the relaxing of the body, this really comes together quite marvelously. And sometimes as well, even the short breaths can get us hyped up as well. So this can be another way to help to bring that about. But again, that feeling of like, yeah, we got it, like that sort of thing, there's— it's really, again, wonderful. And this is a wonderful support, right, is having that Piti. So the next is actually experiencing pleasure. And so this is the Sukkha. This is that feeling actually of satisfaction, of security. Yeah, that feeling of, hey, everything is okay.


### Summary

This is a summary of the Dhamma talk based on your provided transcript:

**Speaker:** A Sangha member (filling in for Scott/Dhammarato).
**Core Subject:** A reading and commentary on the **Anapanasati Sutta (MN 118)**, the discourse on Mindfulness of Breathing.

### **Summary of the Talk:**

1.  **Introduction & Setting:** The speaker sets the stage by reading the sutta's elaborate introduction, which describes a major gathering of accomplished disciples around the Buddha. This section is interpreted as "hyping up" the importance and value of the teaching to come, emphasizing that the Dharma is a precious treasure and the Sangha present was a "rare" and "incomparable field of merit."

2.  **The Promise of Anapanasati:** The speaker highlights the Buddha's key proclamation: when mindfulness of breathing is **developed and cultivated, it is of great fruit and benefit.** It is presented as a complete path because:
    *   It fulfills the **Four Foundations of Mindfulness**.
    *   These fulfill the **Seven Factors of Enlightenment**.
    *   These, in turn, fulfill **true knowledge and deliverance** (enlightenment).
    *   The takeaway: **"Anapanasati can take you all the way. It is the complete package."**

3.  **The Practical Instructions (The 16 Steps):** The speaker reads and comments on the core meditation instructions. A key practical insight attributed to **Dhammarato** is introduced: the 16 steps can be viewed **more like dance steps than a rigid, sequential checklist.** Practitioners can work with them flexibly, sometimes practicing multiple aspects in a single breath.

    The steps are grouped into the traditional four tetrads, corresponding to the Four Foundations of Mindfulness:
    *   **1st Tetrad (Mindfulness of Body):** Noticing long/short breaths, experiencing the *whole body* of breath, and **tranquilizing (calming) bodily formations.** This grounds the practitioner in the present.
    *   **2nd Tetrad (Mindfulness of Feelings - *Vedana*):** Experiencing **rapture (*piti* - joyful energy)** and **pleasure (*sukha* - contentment/happiness)**, then calming the mental formations associated with these feelings. The speaker offers practical advice: simply acknowledging the breath and remembering the practice's great benefit can help generate *piti*.

4.  **Overall Tone & Purpose:** The talk is an encouraging guide and reminder. It aims to:
    *   Reaffirm the supreme value and effectiveness of Anapanasati practice.
    *   Demystify the sutta by framing its elaborate opening as motivational context.
    *   Provide practical, flexible advice for applying the 16 steps, moving beyond a rigid, linear interpretation.
    *   Inspire energy and confidence in the practice by connecting the simple act of mindful breathing to the ultimate goal of liberation.

**In essence, the talk is a communal study session that reinforces Anapanasati as a profound yet accessible core practice, capable of leading a practitioner from basic mindfulness to full enlightenment, especially when approached with flexibility and an understanding of its joyful benefits.**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on your transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and references to stories** to explain and contextualize the *Ānāpānasati Sutta*:

### 1. **Metaphors:**

*   **"The gift that keeps on giving"** – This common metaphor is used to describe the Dharma and the Sangha. It emphasizes that the teachings and the community are a perpetual source of benefit and merit, not a one-time transaction.
*   **"Heartwood"** – This is a direct quote from the sutta translation. It's a powerful metaphor for the Sangha, implying it is composed of the essential, strongest, and most valuable part (like the heartwood of a tree), free from the superficial "prattle" and "chatter" (the sapwood or bark).
*   **"Incomparable field of merit for the world"** – This agricultural metaphor presents the Sangha as a fertile field where even a small "seed" of a gift grows into a great "crop" of merit for the donor.
*   **"The complete package"** – The speaker uses this modern metaphor to summarize the Buddha's point that mindfulness of breathing, when fully developed, contains all the necessary elements for enlightenment. It's an all-in-one practice.
*   **"Dance steps"** – This is a key interpretive metaphor offered by the teacher Dhammarato. Instead of viewing the 16 steps of the practice as a rigid, sequential ladder, he suggests seeing them more like dance steps—elements you can move between, combine, or focus on fluidly based on the present moment's needs.
*   **"Hyping up"** – The speaker repeatedly uses this informal metaphor to describe the sutta's lengthy introductory section. It frames the list of accomplished disciples and the praises of the Sangha as a way to build anticipation and establish the supreme value and credibility of the teaching to come, much like a modern speaker building up to a main point.

### 2. **Stories / Narrative Framing:**

*   **The Story of the Occasion:** The entire talk is built around the **narrative frame provided by the sutta itself**. The speaker sets the scene:
    *   The Buddha is at a large, important gathering during the rainy season retreat (*Pavāraṇā*).
    *   The community is vibrant, with senior monks teaching juniors, and many have attained high levels of realization.
    *   The Buddha praises the assembly and declares his intention to stay longer, which draws even more monks.
    *   This story establishes the teaching's importance and sets the stage for the Buddha's definitive instruction on Ānāpānasati.

*   **The "Hero's Journey" of Practice:** While not a single story, the speaker highlights the **narrative arc of progress** embedded in the sutta:
    *   It starts with practitioners at all different stages (Arahants, Once-Returners, Stream-Enterers).
    *   It outlines a clear path: from the simple act of noticing the breath (Steps 1-4), to cultivating positive mental states like joy and calm (Steps 5-8), and ultimately to full liberation.
    *   The speaker emphasizes this by stating, "Ānāpānasati can take you all the way," framing the practice as a complete narrative journey from beginner to enlightenment.

*   **The Implied Story of "The Winner":** When explaining the step of experiencing *pīti* (rapture/joy), the speaker says it's the **"feeling of joyful success of being a winner."** This injects a modern, relatable story of personal achievement and positive reinforcement into the ancient instruction, making the psychological reward of the practice more tangible.

In summary, the speaker uses metaphors (**heartwood, dance steps, the complete package**) to make the concepts vivid and relatable, while relying on the **embedded story within the sutta**—the setting, the audience, and the progressive path—to provide the primary narrative structure for the talk.
