### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Well, hello folks, this is Saturday morning, Thai time, 9 AM evening time in the US. And today we'll get started talking about something that Ivan had mentioned. Mike, Ivan, what was your question?

**Speaker B:** The question is, is it Can we make our desire work for us in a noble way, or is the noble way require little desire?

**Speaker A:** Actually, that's a very good question. I think that the question comes from the Mahayana part of Buddhism, that seems to have in their own way decided to change the Second Noble Truth and say that the cause of dissatisfaction, the cause of Dukkha, is attachment or wanting. But actually, the Second Noble Truth really is about ignorance, that the ignorant portion of the wanting is what causes dissatisfaction. So what I'm suggesting is that there is a particular thing that we can call wise wanting, and that wise wanting would be— an example would be there are suttas, number 131 in the Majjhima Nikaya, that talks about one fortunate attachment. And that actually has to do with attaching to the present moment. We also know that in sutta number 48, They talk about— the sutra talks about the eagerness for the Dharma. So we can also talk about attachment to the Dharma itself, which would be a wise attachment, a wise wanting. And that part of the wisdom in it is that it doesn't go into craving or needing. An example of that would be within Christianity, they have a thing called proselytizing. The whole show is set up with you get credit from the religion if you proselytize. The Catholics even want birth not control, but they want to prevent abortions and they want women to have babies for the whole point of having more Catholics. So they're very power-oriented. And you can see that how that could happen within the teachings of the Buddha is that somehow or another we want more Buddhist teaching, and that wanting more Buddhists possibly is not a good idea. In fact, you could say that the more Buddhists there are in the world, the more, just more religion there is. Sort of like the difference between the US Army and and the Marines, to where the Army, they want a big army, but the Marines say that all we want is a few good men. So that would be the difference then between Buddhism as a religion, which is the vast majority, versus those who were actually interested in the teachings of the Buddha, most specifically, uh, the Noble Dharma, the supramundane Dharma. And there's only going to be a few of them. And so, um, it's, it's better than— and it's typically true throughout history that Buddhism doesn't proselytize. We don't go out and bring in the sheaves. We don't go out trying to get more people Because that's just a lot of work. It's a lot of work because the teachings of the Buddha, the actual teachings of the Buddha, are profound. They're difficult to understand. And so it's actually a whole lot of work unless someone is actually, let us say, ready for the Dharma. Uh, so what then would be considered someone who is ready for the Dharma is when they want to know, they're asking questions, etc., like that. Um, and, and so if we find new people who are genuinely interested in the Dharma, they're actually a whole lot easier to teach. But if we try to get them by going out and knocking on doors or whatever like that, we're going to have failure. So the noble Dharma would be that we would want to teach the Dharma, but we'd only want to teach it to those who are genuinely interested in it. And want to know. As a side point, you could say that there's a big difference between the Thai police and the American police. The Thai police, they generally sit in their police station and wait for people to come in with complaints or with business for the police to do, to where the American police are out active on the street looking for people. And so that would be the difference then within Buddhism, is that we sit back and we wait. We don't go looking for new people. This would be wise wanting. So wanting to spread the Dharma, but only wanting to spread it to those who are willing to take it. Rather than putting it off on anyone. Now, there's also a second point to that, and that is in ordinary life, when we want things rather than wanting Dharma, if we're wanting things, then we should want them very lightly rather than wanting it in a heavy way. Wanting things, likely like even believing things. If you have no evidence of something, then there is no real reason to believe in it. And yet you can see that most religions have huge numbers of beliefs of things that they can't prove, and they get very much attached to those things. Uh, here's an example of that is how many times have there been conversations, sometimes, uh, very active, rousing conversations, even arguments about the resurrection, and yet the resurrection is completely irrelevant. It's completely irrelevant. There are several reasons why it's completely irrelevant, and, and one of them is that, uh, before Jesus has even died on the cross. He was forgiving the sins of one of the guys who was on the cross. He also forgave someone else. And so in the Christian literature, Jesus is going around forgiving people from their sins before he died. Well, if that's the case, then his death and resurrection really doesn't mean anything. Whether it was true or not. We can just take it as nothing much to it. Whether you believe in it or not is irrelevant, except that when you believe it strongly, that you want it to be true, that's when it becomes an issue or a problem for people, is when they want it to be true. All right, here's another example of that, is that the United States has just used some really huge ordnance to bomb Iraq. And now there's a big discussion about how much damage was done. And some people want a whole lot of damage to be done, and some people want very little damage to be done. But if you don't hold tightly to the belief of whether damage has been done or not, then it doesn't matter. So if you want something in the political world, don't hold to it very tightly, because that's going to be where this— the Dukkha comes from, is you want something to be done, and the more you want it, the more you're going to suffer before you get any evidence. And there's likely no evidence going to be possible. And so take everything very lightly. In fact, there's an old saying that angels can fly only because they take themselves so lightly. So there's two different kinds. One is to attach yourself to wholesome things, but lightly. Or you can attach to anything at all, but do it lightly. But it's better to attach to wholesome things than it is to attach to unwholesome things. But ultimately, the best thing to do with wisdom is just recognize that you like things or you don't like things, without even going to the point of wanting. That in fact, overall, it's kind of irrelevant whether the American bombing of Iraq, Iran destroyed a lot of stuff or didn't destroy a lot of stuff. It's kind of irrelevant. We don't know what the future is going to be. And so there's no reason to attach to What happens there that we can not attach to lightly? And then we can go into the feelings of, well, what do you want? What is your preference? Rather than a demand, we can go into the preferences and liking and not liking, and from there we can go into having no feelings much at all with it. So, Navid, you, you said you, you made a statement. This is relevant to you. Tell me about it.

**Speaker C:** Well, Dhammarato, I'm Persian myself. So, uh, you know, like, they bombed supposedly, or whatever it is, it's Fahan. That's the city where my dad was born. You know, so I've been watching a lot of it, but realizing that I just get anxious. And, you know, does it really matter? I mean, I'm all the way over here and nothing is affecting me.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. How old are you? I mean, how old is your dad?

**Speaker C:** My dad just passed away a couple of years ago, but he was 93. But he was in Belgium. He wasn't even in in Iran either. He had left and gone to Africa back in the '60s. So yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. So it's gotten really, really old, huh, for you?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah. It's very distant, but it's still kind of— I mean, my mind makes it relevant. It's not necessarily relevant at all.

**Speaker A:** Exactly so. So, but that's true for everything, isn't it? Everything is like that. It's only when the mind attaches to it that it becomes relevant. That if you didn't know about it, never heard about it, then in fact in the old days you could go so far as to say, well, what about the wars that happened 100 years ago?

**Speaker C:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** If you don't know about it and you don't care about it, then it's not relevant. To you. Yeah, that's true about almost everything, isn't it? It's not relevant.

**Speaker C:** I'm seeing that. I'm seeing that.

**Speaker A:** So even now that you do know, why do you make it relevant? Yeah, yeah, that's a big question, isn't it? Why do we know things and then make them relevant where in fact if we didn't know, it would be irrelevant.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that has to do then with ignorant attachment. But if we can remember wisely, that is really not relevant, not to the present moment. It may be relevant to the people in Tehran who were in their automobiles and stuck in traffic trying to get out, But that's because each one of them made it relevant. Overall, very few people have been killed, and yet overall the whole society is all freaked out. The bombing stopped. So if we can take that as an example, Naveen, we can recognize that we do that with everything. We make it relevant and then we attach to it ignorantly without even knowing that we're the one who made it relevant.

**Speaker C:** I see.

**Speaker A:** And we tell ourselves stories about it. We make stuff up. Yeah, we, we want to come to a conclusion. That in fact the wise wanting that we're talking about from Ivan's perspective, the wise wanting is actually irrelevant, and we know that it's irrelevant. Whether there's 100 million or 200 or 400 or 800 million Buddhists in the world is irrelevant to you. How many Buddhists there are means nothing. The question is, can we practice wisely? Can we stop having, um, let us say, ignoble, ignorant wantings? So this is a really good perspective to take, Ivan, is to recognize when you want something, because the wanting is based upon our feelings. Then in fact, I could go even further to say that all right and wrong is merely a judgment based upon feelings, and normally those feelings are taught. Christianity has the belief that morality comes from God, but really morality comes from feelings, in the sense that if something happens, if something is dangerous and you don't like it, then because you don't like it, you'll say that it's bad. And if you like something, and you want to like it and gain it and promote it, then when someone prevents that, then you say that they are immoral, where in fact you made that up. One of my favorite stories, and in fact this comes from Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, he was able to read the Bible without having to read it through a Christian perspective. And when he was reading about the story of Adam and Eve, he came across a really profound, important point. And that was that Adam and Eve were tossed out of the Garden of Eden not because they disobeyed some rule or law. It's because of their actions. And what was their actions? They had to put up with the results, so they ate of the fruit. They put up with the results of the knowledge of good and evil. What that means is judgments. So you take your feelings, I like it and I don't like it, and turn that into good or evil, you lose your paradise. And we do that ignorantly. So be careful when you don't like something, when you judge it to be bad or even evil, Remember that that's a judgment that you've made. You may share that judgment with other people, but that destroys your paradise. If you stop judging other people, if you stop judging the wars, if you stop judging Mara or stop judging the United States, you can live in paradise. But if you take a side, then you lose your paradise, and your paradise now is dependent upon the outcomes of what you like and you don't like. So when you choose, choose wisely. That in fact, when you're choosing, that means you choose not to take a side as opposed to having to choose a side. Don't take a side. If you don't take a side, then you can keep your happy disposition. You can live in paradise. But if you take a side, now your feelings depend upon the outcome of something you have no control over. And sometimes you get what you want, sometimes you don't.

**Speaker B:** I think this is a very conditioned thing in the ordinary world, right? People say stuff like, you know, if you stay neutral, you don't take a side, you are siding with evil. Anicca, stuff like that. It's a very common use point that people talk about.

**Speaker A:** That's because they have taken a side, and so you're evil because you don't take their side.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well, here's one point about that, and that is wars and conflicts only happen because people have already chosen sides. So you could say then the reality is, is choosing sides is what's evil. Choosing sides is what's evil. So don't choose a side.

**Speaker C:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato, go ahead, tell me.

**Speaker C:** No, I mean, you know, there was a genocide in Rwanda where we were living, and people started asking us to take sides. And I remember how they were trying to destroy friendships. I told them I'm not taking any sides. It doesn't matter which tribe is trying to kill which other tribe. The whole thing is not— I'm not even interested in it.

**Speaker A:** Good for you. But now you're taking a side about Iraq— or excuse me, Iran— and you're nowhere near the place.

**Speaker C:** No, I was saying it's relevant because you're speaking about something that else is on my mind. But yes, I was trying not to take sides. Even though, you know, I was siding with Israel a little bit, and I realized there's no need to do any of that.

**Speaker A:** Yes, no reason to take sides.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** That'S the ultimately wise thing to do, is to not take sides against or for anything, even your own position. Yeah, this is so basically what we can say is, is that, um, people by their habit, by their, uh, education, and by their instincts normally want to avoid danger. Because we normally want to avoid danger, we begin to see danger where no danger exists. This is called confirmation bias. And so wanting to avoid danger is more important than wanting to have, let us say, a good outcome. We want to avoid the bad, but there is an old law someplace that says that we attract the things that we're afraid of. An example of that is a dog. If you're afraid of a dog, he's the one that's going to attack you. If you're not afraid of the dog, he's not going to be afraid of you and not attack you. So that's actually a universal kind of thing, that if you're not afraid of someone, then you're much more likely to make friends with them. But if you are afraid of them, then they may become afraid of you. You see that in a lot of movies, that we attract the things that we are afraid of. So what that does is it brings up a consistency that we go around trying to avoid danger, and so we find danger many places. And so in the teachings of the Buddha, we have to start changing those unwholesome states of there is danger into the wholesome state that there is no danger and everything is okay. And so we kind of change it from the negative to the positive because we haven't really dealt with the underlying condition. We're just changing the direction that it's going. So the first thing that we do is that we avoid the danger and we seek out the wholesome. Now I'm making the distinction between wholesome and positive. That in fact, there's an old book that's very famous. It came out as, oh gosh, 1950s or '60s by Norman Vincent Peale. Called The Power of Positive Thinking. Well, Norman Vincent Peale was actually a preacher somewhere in New York, and the idea of trying to make stuff positive actually is taking a side. So we take the side of the positive, but with wholesome, the wholesomeness means that we're not really taking a side. And so that would be a good distinction for those who understand it and have asked that question. I see, in fact, on Discord, a lot of people will change the word wholesome into positive. And so let's make sure that we're talking about wholesome versus unwholesome, but then let's not cling too strong to the wholesome. Let's not cling, let's not grasp, especially grasping ignorantly. Let's start grasping very lightly, and pretty soon over time we practice into— there's really nothing there, there's nothing to it. We can take kind of an easygoing neutral place because ultimately all those sides that people have been taking is kind of empty. There's nothing to it. It's not really there, just like Naveen was talking about. In his mind, there was conflict, but really he created that conflict in his mind by taking sides. If we don't take sides, that means then that we can leave things as kind of a balanced, neutral, everything is okay kind of position. So, Potato, is that Amarath?

**Speaker D:** Eric, at your service.

**Speaker A:** All right, so what do you think? Are you going to be taking sides?

**Speaker D:** I don't intend to.

**Speaker A:** So when you take sides, you do it ignorantly, is that what you're saying?

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. So unskillfully would be another way of saying it. So when you take a side, know that you're taking a side. If you take a side, know it wisely so that you don't take that side in a strong way. Take it very lightly, and pretty soon you don't have to take it. It's easy to put things down that you don't take.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, sometimes I feel the consequences or the allegiance of, of that side until later. When I'm taking or doing the action that is in effect taking sides, I don't feel it as consequential, but I do later. Like, I feel like I've taken a bit of value of the focus on the practice and put it somewhere else.

**Speaker A:** So if we can stay practice-oriented, I like that. Phrase, because we're practicing to keep things light, to keep things wholesome, and to keep things not important, nothing to it. And so when we begin to see that we've taken a side, you know what happens when we take a side? The more we take it, the stronger it gets, and pretty soon we're in a state of Dukkha, we're in a state of dissatisfaction. Because we've clung so hard. So if you begin to cling, if you begin to take sides, know that you're doing that so that you can prevent yourself from getting strongly attached to it. So, Red, Red Dono, what do you have to say about this?

**Speaker E:** The only side I take is to do the inquiry, but lightly, as you told me. That would be it, probably. I don't have to hold strongly to anything. From the Bible, I heard a passage that means, that would say, everything you do in the world is ultimately futile. But it doesn't remove the wholesome and unwholesome and bad and good from the equation. Just you don't have to hold tightly to those two. So I guess just being curious, but not too curious, not holding tightly to anything, that would be probably it.

**Speaker A:** Good point. You see, there are some good things in the Bible, so no need to even attach to the good or the bad that's in the Bible because it's a mixed bag. Everything's actually a mixed bag. And in fact, I could mention about that.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** There is, in some religions, there is a law that they call the law of karma. Law of karma. Law of karma. How many of you have ever heard that there's a law, and the law is, is that if you do good things, you'll get good results, and if you do bad things, you'll get bad results? Ivan, have you ever heard of that law?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's very commonly— again, people use that sort of thinking a lot. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** In fact, that's a major law of Christianity, that if you do bad things, you're going to go to hell, but if you do good things like bring in more Christians, then that's doing good, and so therefore you'll get forgiveness and then you'll go to heaven. So it's actually a major underlying condition for Christianity, but it's also in Islam. But it was mainly an old thing that was taught. This got started about 800 BC with the Brahmins when they were put in a position that they had to justify that they were born— they were born Brahmin. And so they justified it by saying that, oh, in the deep past we were good, therefore we were born Brahman, but you were not born Brahman, that's proof enough that you were bad. This is what actually gave birth to the belief system of reincarnation, was based upon the justification for being born Brahman. But the Buddha taught that no, we can use the word Brahman as an ideal and then say that it depends upon your current status, not something in the deep dark past, that you can become noble-minded in the present moment. You can become Brahman now rather than Brahman from birth. But then the Buddha had a better teaching in the sense that all action is not either good or bad, that in fact most action is a mixed bag, completely mixed bag. An example of that would be a medical doctor. He performs medical procedures which people would call good, but then he wants a lot of money for it. He becomes greedy. Sometimes he makes mistakes, etc., like that. And so you can see then that all professions have mixture. There's a mixed bag. They say that clouds have a silver lining. Generally, because of the way of the sun, it's a golden lining, but you know what I mean. And that's, in fact, you could say then that clouds that have silver lining is just another aspect of a mixed bag. Everything is mixed. It's very hard to do something good that's actually good. Normally we do good out of desire to do good, and therefore it's going to have Dukkha built right into it if we do it ignorantly. But the Buddha also teaches that there is a fourth kind of action that's neither bright nor dark. You do things in the moment just because this is what we're doing in the moment, that we're not intending to hurt people, and so we don't, nor are we intending to do good in order to get further results in the future. That the Kamma that is taught is all about doing good now in order to get a future good result Or doing a bad action now will eventually gain you a bad result. But if we keep things right in the moment, then we don't do good for merit, nor do we do bad because we are watching what we're doing. And that leads to the fourth kind of karma that the Buddha says brings the end of karma, brings the end to our actions. That almost all the actions that we take, like for instance dropping bombs or a war or an argument or anything, whatever we're taking, whatever we're doing, we normally do it out of motivation for something good or something bad. So if we stop doing things out of motivation for doing good or doing bad, we stop doing a lot of the actions and we can just sit down and rest. This is the noble. Almost all ignoble is taking the side of either the good or the bad. But when we don't take sides, we don't have to act. If you don't take the side, there's no reason to have an action for or against. And so this is the teaching of the Buddha, is that almost every action is a mixed bag. Once you recognize that almost everything you do is a mixed bag, then you'll stop doing so much. I see you smiling, Carol. What do you have to say?

**Speaker G:** Did you mean me?

**Speaker A:** Yes. Carolyn.

**Speaker G:** Christina.

**Speaker A:** Christina. Okay. Christina. Sorry.

**Speaker C:** No.

**Speaker G:** It's okay. No. It's— there's a lot of wisdom in that. If you— the more you do, the.

**Speaker A:** More.

**Speaker G:** You know, you have to concern yourself with what the outcome could be. So if you do less, take it easy, and not be, you know, too motivated by the outcome, then life is good.

**Speaker A:** Yes, our whole society that's based upon good and bad look for more and more and more. Some sides are looking for more good, they want it better and better and better. And some people are looking for danger and want more and more and more of it. But if we recognize that Dukkha comes with the good or the bad, because everything is a mixed bag, then we can begin to do less. Just take it easy. Life is good, not a problem in the world. But we have to practice that because we are already deeply motivated out of habit. So our practice then, Ivan, is to practice to do nothing. Don't take any sides. Stay neutral. Stay easygoing. But if you're going to attach, attach to something that is wholesome. And if you're not going to attach to anything, then that's the way to go. Ben, do you have anything to say? Taking sides, taking sides is a lot of hard work. We can just rest in the middle instead. No need to Yes, everything is stuck in the middle. Now, um, Kawan asked a question. We can change the topic slightly. Kawan asked a question about boredom. Isn't, uh, it— doesn't it look like to you that boredom would come by not taking any sides? Actually, that's not the case. Ivan, have you been bored recently?

**Speaker B:** I don't think so. Maybe. Yeah, I think maybe. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Emret, how about you? Have you been bored recently? Or at all? Ever? Potato?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, I've been bored.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Are you bored? Have you been bored? Are you bored now?

**Speaker D:** No, not right now.

**Speaker A:** Anna, how about you? Do you get bored?

**Speaker H:** No, but I always take sides. It's my job. I just drop them very fast. So, as you said, I just take them lightly.

**Speaker C:** Good.

**Speaker H:** I'm very busy on board. I'm always taking sides and drop them.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Generally, boredom is the feeling that what we're doing right now is not good enough. So the example that I would use is that family is taking a trip, they're in the car, the children are in the back seat, and they start saying, Mommy, Mommy, I'm bored. What does mommy do when she hears the kids are bored?

**Speaker D:** Distracts them, some sort of entertainment.

**Speaker A:** Give them something to do. That's it. She'll play a game with them or give them some board game to play with each other. Maybe she'll start yelling at them and give them something to do so that they're not bored. Okay, so we can say then that boredom comes from not liking what we're doing right now. Another way of saying it, and in fact the way that it's stated in the suttas, is that it's restlessness. That we're not at peace, we're not satisfied with the way things are. So what I would suggest for boredom is, first off, to recognize that you have the feeling of boredom, that whatever you're doing right now, let us say you're playing a game on the cell phone, or you're listening to a talk on YouTube, maybe about bombing Iran or politicians bombing each other, but whatever you're doing right now and you have that sense of boredom come up, remember that you've just gotten kind of tired of what's happening right now. And so one of the easy things to do is to put the cell phone down or put down whatever you're doing Close your eyes and take a rest from whatever you're doing. Wow, everything is okay. In other words, we don't have to go find something new to do. Let's say you're playing a game, maybe solitaire or something, and you change that game to Sudoku. The boredom is going to stay there too, and so now you're bored with two games. The better thing to do is to stop altogether. What you're doing when you're bored and just relax. Wow, everything is already okay. I've become bored because I'm trying to do something and it's not satisfying. We're restless. We can't get any rest. It's also the same thing as worry. So in the Buddha's framework, boredom can be dealt with simply by having the wisdom, having the non-ignorance to see that what you're doing right now is not to your liking, it's not to your effectiveness. That you can in fact think of it as when we get tired, we've gotten tired because we've already gotten bored, and we keep doing what we're doing not enjoying it, not getting any value out of it, but we keep doing it and we keep doing it out of habit, and we wind up being tired. So if you are tired, the best thing again to do is what we said about boredom, and that is to stop whatever you're doing, take a deep breath, and just relax. And do nothing at all. I know that our society does not promote doing nothing. That's what makes the Buddha's teaching so profound, is because the Buddha's teaching is to stop, to stop doing, stop doing the things that are boring, stop doing the things that are tiring, and just take a rest. Everything is okay, everything is fine. Wow, what a relief it is to stop playing that game, because I was getting bored with it. So does anybody have any comments about that? Ivan, do you recognize that you get bored sometimes? You get dissatisfied with what you're doing.

**Speaker B:** It's nice to see it and nice to make a change. I mean, enjoying the boredom, not in a— don't have to be in an unwholesome state.

**Speaker A:** So Dhammarato, I haven't picked on you. Do you get bored ever? I feel like it's just a passing phenomenon. I try not to dwell on it.

**Speaker B:** If it does arise.

**Speaker A:** Yes, so now you have a new tool that when it does arise, you can say, "Aha, I see you, boredom. Let me stop what I'm doing because I'm not getting any satisfaction out of what I'm doing right now." Now we can either distract by going and doing something else, but as nobles, the better thing to do is to just stop and say, wow, I'm glad I saw that I've gotten bored with that game. Let me stop that game. Wow, I got bored with that computer program I'm writing. Let me stop writing that computer program right now. Or whatever it is that we're doing that brings about boredom, Let's just stop. So does anybody have any questions? We covered two topics today. One is the boredom, and the other one, which also has to do with getting tired— boring and tired are just 2 stages of the same state. And we often get, let's say, attached to something, then we keep doing it and doing it, and we get bored, and then we get tired of doing it. So always waking up to see what we're doing is the correct thing to do. To wake up, look at what we're doing, put a stop to it. We live our lives like that, we don't get bored, we don't get tired, we just get happy. Hmm, everything is okay, everything is fine, not a problem in the world, except the ones that we make up. So, Nabad, what do you think?

**Speaker C:** I think I should come to more of your meetings.

**Speaker A:** I'm sorry, can you repeat that?

**Speaker C:** I said I should come more often to these Sanghas.

### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends, centers on two interconnected themes: **wise wanting and the practice of non-attachment**, and **dealing with boredom and restlessness**.

Here is a summary of the key points:

### 1. Wise Wanting vs. Ignorant Craving
*   **Core Question:** Can desire be noble, or does the noble path require little desire?
*   **The Buddha's Teaching:** The cause of suffering (dukkha) is not desire itself, but *ignorant* desire. There is a place for "wise wanting" (e.g., eagerness for the Dhamma, attachment to the present moment).
*   **Key Distinction:** Wise wanting is light, without craving or need. It is not about proselytizing or forcing views on others, but being available to teach those who are genuinely ready and asking questions.
*   **Application in Life:** We can want things, but should hold those wants "lightly." Taking strong sides (in politics, conflicts, beliefs) leads to suffering because our happiness becomes dependent on uncontrollable outcomes. The talk uses the example of news about bombings—making it "relevant" and choosing a side creates internal conflict where none need exist.

### 2. The Danger of Taking Sides
*   **Paradise Lost:** Drawing from a story about Adam and Eve, Dhammarato suggests we lose our inner peace ("paradise") not by breaking rules, but by engaging in the "knowledge of good and evil"—that is, by making strong judgments based on our likes and dislikes.
*   **The Noble Stance:** The wisest position is to not take sides. Conflict exists because people choose sides. By remaining neutral and not clinging to opinions about good/bad or right/wrong, we preserve our peace and live in a state of okayness.
*   **Practice:** If you find yourself taking a side, recognize it and hold it lightly. The ultimate goal is to see that most actions are a "mixed bag" of wholesome and unwholesome, and to act from a place of present-moment awareness rather than a motive to achieve "good" or avoid "bad" outcomes.

### 3. Dealing with Boredom and Restlessness
*   **Nature of Boredom:** Boredom is a form of restlessness and dissatisfaction with the present moment. It's the feeling that what we are doing is "not good enough."
*   **Common but Unskillful Response:** We often try to eliminate boredom by seeking a new distraction (e.g., switching from one game to another).
*   **Skillful Response:** The Dhamma solution is to **stop**. When boredom arises, see it as a signal. Put down the activity, close your eyes, and simply rest. Recognize that everything is already okay without needing a new stimulus. This practice of stopping prevents boredom from escalating into fatigue and maintains happiness.

### Overall Message
The path involves moving from **ignorant, heavy attachment** (which causes suffering) to **wise, light interest**, and ultimately towards **non-clinging**. By not taking sides, holding wants lightly, and resting instead of chasing distractions, we cultivate a peaceful mind where "everything is okay, everything is fine, not a problem in the world, except the ones that we make up."

The talk ends with an encouragement to connect with the Sangha for support and friendship in this practice.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by the speakers, primarily by Speaker A (Dhammarato), to illustrate the teachings on wise desire, non-attachment, and not taking sides:

### **Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **The US Army vs. The Marines:** Used to contrast proselytizing religion with the Dharma. The Army wants a "big army" (like religions seeking many converts), while the Marines want "a few good men" (like the Dharma, which is profound and only for those genuinely ready and seeking it).

2.  **Thai Police vs. American Police:** Illustrates the same point about not forcing teachings. Thai police "sit in their station and wait for people to come in with complaints," analogous to waiting for those genuinely interested in the Dharma. American police are "out on the street looking for people," analogous to proselytizing.

3.  **Angels Can Fly...:** "Angels can fly only because they take themselves so lightly." A metaphor for the importance of holding desires, beliefs, and attachments lightly to avoid suffering (Dukkha).

4.  **The Dog:** If you're afraid of a dog, it's more likely to attack you. If you're not afraid, it's less likely to attack. This illustrates the principle that "we attract the things we are afraid of" and that fear itself creates conflict and danger.

5.  **The Cloud's Silver Lining:** Represents the idea that everything is a "mixed bag" of good and bad, wholesome and unwholesome. It's used to argue against rigidly classifying actions and outcomes as purely good or evil.

6.  **Children in the Back Seat:** A story about children on a car trip saying, "I'm bored!" The mother distracts them with a game. This metaphor explains **boredom** as restlessness and dissatisfaction with the present moment, suggesting the solution is not a new distraction but to stop and rest.

### **Stories & Parables**

1.  **Adam and Eve (from Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's interpretation):** This is a central story. They were expelled from the Garden of Eden not for disobedience, but for eating the fruit of the "knowledge of good and evil." The moral is that **judging** things as good or evil based on our likes/dislikes (feelings) is what causes us to lose our inner "paradise" or peace.

2.  **The Resurrection of Jesus:** Used as an example of an irrelevant belief that people argue about and attach to strongly. The speaker points out that Jesus forgave sins *before* his death, making the resurrection theologically unnecessary for that purpose, thus highlighting how clinging to such beliefs causes conflict.

3.  **The U.S. Bombing of Iran/Iraq:** A contemporary example used multiple times. It illustrates how people take sides and want a certain narrative (e.g., "a lot of damage" vs. "little damage") to be true, creating anxiety and conflict in their own minds about events they cannot control and that are ultimately irrelevant to their present moment.

4.  **The Origin of the Law of Karma (with Brahmins):** A historical story about how the concept of karma and reincarnation was originally formulated by Brahmins around 800 BC to justify their high-born status ("we were good in a past life"). This contrasts with the Buddha's teaching that nobility is based on present-moment action and understanding, not past deeds.

5.  **The Medical Doctor:** An example of the "mixed bag" nature of all action. A doctor performs good (healing) but may also be motivated by greed (high fees) and can make mistakes. This story supports the argument that almost all action is a mixture of wholesome and unwholesome elements.

### **Core Conceptual Metaphors**
*   **Taking Sides / Choosing Sides:** The entire talk frames unwise desire and attachment as "taking a side" (for/against, good/evil, like/dislike), which leads to conflict and suffering.
*   **Paradise:** Used as a metaphor for a peaceful, happy mind. This state is lost when one "takes sides" and makes judgments.
*   **Mixed Bag:** A recurring metaphor for the nature of reality and action, opposing black-and-white, dualistic thinking.

These metaphors and stories effectively translate abstract Buddhist concepts like *tanha* (craving), *dukkha* (suffering), and *upekkha* (equanimity) into relatable, modern-day scenarios and imagery.
