### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Started the recording, I believe. Yes, I did. And all right, buddy, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** All right, thank you. So I've been doing the practice, and I have certainly gotten, I think, one of the most important fruits from my Dharma practice, period. And it comes straight from Dhammarato's teachings, just about the ability to clean stuff out of my mind And to be able to come back to a sense of actually I'm okay, everything is okay. Who cares about whatever threats there are? Who cares about what that person said? You know what? I'm not physically damaged. You know, their threat or whatever did not— is not actually occurring right now. I'm not dealing with that. Everything is actually okay. It's just words and imagination and BS. And I don't need to let that stop me from feeling well in any way whatsoever. So that's the real fruit that I've gotten so far. But what I would really like you to think about is the concept of Piti, because as I understand, like, Piti is supposed to be this like kind of emotional exhilaration. I'll just stop. I have no idea. I don't know. And I would love you to talk about it. Sukkha, I feel like I kind of more understand as just taking that deep relaxing breath and just feeling like everything is really okay and relaxing into the moment. I don't know if that's the best description of it, but I would really like to hear about Sukkha somewhat, and if I got it right, then great. If not, then correct that. But just more about Piti, what is the essence of Piti, and then cultivating Piti, because that's where I feel like I'm not I feel like that's the next step for me, but I'm just not there and not very sure about it. So I'd love to hear about what you have to say.

**Speaker C:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, that's a good question, man. Yeah, Piti, the way Dhammarato described it to me, Piti is like the wow factor of yes, we can do this after we're practicing Anapanasati and the Noble Eightfold Path. It's, I think in a lot of ways, I think Piti is what a lot of people kind of romanticize enlightenment to be in a way, because it's where you're developing this wisdom that's already been laying dormant inside you. When you're practicing the Eightfold Path and you find these moments of, wow, I actually can do this, this is possible, this is not bullshit, it's just simple real world practical things that anybody can do. There's a difference between— for years I can say the same things I'm saying now, but there's a difference when you're actually with yourself, seeing that you can do it, seeing that these old triggers aren't triggering you anymore. And if you do tend to get triggered, having the ability and the Sati to see that it's only the mind. It's only, as Ajahn Chah says, it's only the hot iron ball. From any way you try to control this hot iron ball of the mind, you're going to get burned. Everything's Anicca, Dukkha, and Nata. And in your moments, whether you recognize that you avoided a trigger or recognize that you got triggered and are able to change it joyfully with wholesome nurturing speech and action, when one can really see that they have the ability to do this, I feel like the floodgates open. And that to me is what Piti is, in my opinion. But does anybody else have anything they'd like to say about that? Please feel free.

**Speaker D:** I have a question. Is it essentially like the winner's attitude then, kind of what I'm getting? Like the letting go of victimhood and self-victimization and fully stepping into being a winner, a champion, but the joy of that?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I think that involves Sukkha, joy, and Piti. Like, there is that factor. It is a confidence that, yeah, I can actually do this. And so yeah, that's a bit of it too. Nice, thank you. Yeah, no problem. Anybody else have any— want to answer those questions from those guys? Or anybody, anybody else have anything they want to say?

**Speaker E:** I think a good way to talk about Piti and Sukkha is to give some examples. You know, like we talk about, oh, how nice it is to be able to relax, or oh wow, oh wow, what a relief it is to be okay right now. Do you ever have that feeling, David? Wow, what a relief it is to be okay right now. That's Piti. Yes, yeah, wow, Piti, wow, it's here, it's now, right? So, okay, I like to think of it too in a nice way of like Piti is when you see water and you're thirsty, you know you can drink it soon because you're going towards it, right? Because you know that you have feet and they're going to carry you there. And then Sukkha is when you get the water, you drink it, you know, you don't need anything else at that point, you're good, you've got your water, everything's great. Oh wow, how nice it is to know that I'm going to drink water soon. Because I can practice correctly. Wow, this really rouses me. This really gets me going. It really gets my energy going. What's that?

**Speaker B:** It's really leaning into it as you're having that winner's attitude, that winner's mindset. It comes up, you're like, wait, I don't need to deal with this. I don't need to be in this low state of being right now. I can let all that go and then just continue to just lean through that.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** Absolutely, and knowing that that's coming up is really— that's where that Piti can come from. We talk about cultivating it, and the way that we cultivate it is the same way that we cultivate an attitude, you know, we look at what's going on. So when we practice correctly and we look at ourselves practicing correctly and we see that and we know what's happening and we know what the fruits of that practice is, this is how we cultivate Piti. We just take notice of it. Wow, it's nice to be okay right now. Wow, it's a good time to practice. 'Wow, I can't believe I can do this wherever I am.' Yeah, you know, this is really, really, really good stuff. And I mean, you can feel it when you talk like that, you know what I mean? You give to yourself or to others, you know. So to me, that's a really good way to think about Piti and to think about Sukkha. Piti can cool down into Sukkha. Sukkha can be there with Piti. There are mental objects like anything else. But the way that we cultivate it is by really paying attention to how good it can feel to practice correctly, you know, and to just keep doing that. And it just comes and goes on its own. It's a wonderful thing.

**Speaker B:** Thank you for that. Also, I want to say that you have— like, you should win the award for the best smile of like all the people. You, you always have just— I've been watching so many videos and I I see every time I see your face, dude, you are like the most joyful dude on that podcast, no matter who else is there. You outshine Dhammarato sometimes.

**Speaker E:** I tell you what, man, it's all this stuff we're talking about. You know what I mean? It's getting to see the Dharma and know the Dharma and practice the Dharma and then come around other people who are practicing the Dharma. It's really, it's a really, really wonderful thing. Yeah, celebrate it. Could you do me a favor?

**Speaker B:** Just because like I really see you and I just— you're just dripping success in the practice, you know? Like you're just wet with success.

**Speaker E:** I appreciate it.

**Speaker B:** Could you talk a little bit about like your history with the practice? And how it's developed to this place of just being totally immersed in that.

**Speaker E:** Pool of Jhana land, you know. So let's see, it's probably been roughly maybe 2 years or so, I think, since I started to take a really big interest in practicing the Dhamma and learning the Dharma and talking about the Dharma and being in the Dharma. And to me, it was a very amazing thing to come across it. And I say amazing kind of purposely because I got a little lost in it, you know, if that makes sense, just like a maze. But it was a really, really nice thing to come across because.

**Speaker A:** Anapanasati, how.

**Speaker C:** Do I say that?

**Speaker E:** I had a lot of dissatisfaction. I had a lot of issues with things like, you know, having gone off to war, family stuff, things like this. And there were a lot of parts of my life that didn't really make a lot of sense to me. And it was something I was always out looking to have resolved, you know, to find something that made some sense. The number one thing that I found is the teachings of the Buddha. And I don't recall exactly what it was that, you know, pointed me in that direction. I think probably something about meditation stood out to me, but I really didn't understand much about it or what it meant to meditate. I read a lot of books, I did a lot of you know, researching on the internet and other such things. But I then found Dhammarato, I think through Reddit, and started to talk to him about, you know, what it really was like to practice Dharma like he had and like his friends had and such, you know, in the areas that he had, and what it was that I could do to further my practice. And it was Very interesting to me how simply he brought it up, you know, the very simple nature of the practice when he introduced it to me. And it was very interesting to me that he had so much joy in his life that he was pretty well dedicated to just sharing it with others. To me, that was a really, really, really interesting thing. I was like, who is this person that's just out there just talking to people about this? For no reason other than because he really, really, really enjoys it. And it's a big part of his life. And to me, that was very attractive. That was a very cool thing to come across. And especially since he wasn't looking to charge money for a retreat or do any number of other things like that, that we find, you know, so much in the West when we start looking at the Dhamma. So I kept talking to him and I practice the way that he told me to because he inspired a lot of faith in me, you know, and that it grew into confidence in the practice as it went on because like he always says, the results are immediate. They're always immediate when you practice correctly, you know. There's nothing that takes place at any other time in correct practice. The results are always immediate, they're plain to see, and you got to look at them for yourself in order to understand what's really going down. And so I started to practice the way that he had taught me and the way that he kind of coached me and such. And I, like I said, found immediate result in that and found that that gave me more than enough confidence to, you know, be inspired to continue the practice. And from there, it was a lot of repetition, a lot of doing the same thing, a lot of seeing where I would basically pick up old habits, you know, and then remembering to put them back down, that they're not mine, I don't need them, I don't have to carry them around with me. And that as this went on and it kind of gained steam, you know, got a little more.

**Speaker A:** Got a little.

**Speaker E:** More flow to it, it went on and on and on and kind of gathered its own momentum, I noticed more and more often those occasions where I was doing the same old thing, you know. And really, I think a good way to talk about the path is, uh, the path is not what we've done before, you know. So I'd noticed many of the times that I was slipping back into, oh, this sucks, or oh, this poor me, or what have you, however you want to describe it. And there were some bumps and whatnot, you know, anytime you're learning new skills and such, I think that you encounter some bumps. But really, this practice and this feeling of joy and everything like that, it's— there's nothing like it. And not only is there nothing like it, but I don't really— how do you say this? There came a point in time where I didn't really see much else as far as like how to incline the mind one way or another as worthwhile. So I'm talking about different mental states, different attitudes, like attitudes regarding maybe competition or something like this, you know, or wanting things like that. When you start to look at them after a while, they lose a lot of the shine to them that they used to have, and it's not anything insane. It's just a feeling of, I don't want to fuck with that anymore. I'm done with that. Get rid of that. It's old news. It's not worthwhile. However it is that you want to say it. But that sense of dispassion towards them really pushed it along a little further. So as far as.

**Speaker A:** As far as.

**Speaker E:** My journey towards Dhamma is concerned, I would say that it's a lot like everybody else's. I guess there's a lot of dissatisfaction in the world and it is something that doesn't really get remedied any other way. And I think it's why when you start to practice, you'll see the Dhamma pop up all over the place, all of the time.

**Speaker B:** And.

**Speaker E:** Nothing magical, it's that these are very effective means of dealing with this moment, with this situation, with this set of circumstances, or however you want to call them.

**Speaker C:** So.

**Speaker E:** Really, it kind of builds on itself after a certain point, if that makes sense, you know, because you start to see it all over the place and that way you get these reminders like, 'Hey, it's okay, it's all right, you know, everything is good, we can do this, I got this, I'm on top of it,' whatever the attitude is, you know, when you look into the world and you have a good practice, practice correctly and everything like that. You find it's not so hard to keep it going, like pushing a swing with a child on it. Got to push it a bit at first. Whoo-hoo, man, I'm pushing this kid. But eventually you're just tapping it, tapping it. Oh, look, and then you can watch a little bit. Oh man, I'll just watch this kid swing. How nice. You know, if it gets a little out of— maybe a little slowdown, just more taps. So I don't know, how's that? Is that a decent enough answer? I've never really tried to talk like that.

**Speaker B:** I love your answer. Honestly, you just said like, I feel very confident from your answer that if I just continue to keep practicing, my practice and success is going to continue to snowball and I'm going to be smiling like you all the time. That's what I want.

**Speaker E:** That's it. Yes. And I tell you right now, one of the best parts about it is Smile there, no smile there. I'm okay. And that really there, that's, that's quite joyful. That gives me some tingles. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, very good to share. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Very good. Anybody else have anything they want to talk about? Or— oh, hey, JJ. I didn't see you there. I'm in the cab, but hi. Walking a cat? That's cool.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** I just had to mention that. It's easier for me to listen than to hang up. Oh, you're in a cab. You're walking a cat? Sweet. Probably enjoys that. Cats love eating grass, man. Anyways, anybody else have anything on their mind? Anything they wish to talk about at all?

**Speaker F:** I just wanna mention that I really love the vibes here. It's really joyful, positive, and makes the smile grow wide.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, thank you everyone. Yes, absolutely. Thank you, Thomas, Thomas. Definitely, man. Yeah, society isn't like this. Society, they're really into competition, they're really into this, they're really into that, gaining and losing and all this stuff. But you know, sometimes it's just nice to be around a whole bunch of people who just want to get away from society the best they can, to get out of the rat race.

**Speaker B:** Alexander, it looks like you work out. Is that true?

**Speaker E:** Not as much anymore. I probably could use a little more exercise.

**Speaker B:** I was wondering if you have any particular thoughts on like really enjoying exercise, because I've made a decision today that that's something that I want to do, and I wonder if you or anyone else has any particular advice on that subject.

**Speaker E:** One of the things I know that always comes up for me when I'm out doing something for my physical fitness, for my health, something like that is, wow, it is really nice to have a fully functioning body right now. You know, like I said, I was a soldier, so, you know, I saw a lot of examples of people that came home without fully functioning bodies and such things like that. And it did not look like it was always the most fun. Not that they weren't resilient people, you know, not that they didn't still do what they needed to do, but rather looks like it's enjoyable to have a fully functioning body, you know. So if I'm running, if I'm lifting, if I'm doing something else like that, for me, a lot of the times what comes up is, wow, it's really great that my body can move like this right now. Wow, it's really nice that I can go and run, or I can go and lift something, or wow, it's great to take care of myself. I really like taking care of my body. It's really nice when I take care of my body, you know. It's great that I know that I can do that. And those types of wholesome thoughts really helped me get into this, you know, not really get into, keep it up, you know what I mean? Does that make sense? It really helps me keep it up, you know, because I remember a lot of times, a lot of times when you're exercising, you can be sucking pretty hard, you know, you can go, oh, fuck, this sucks. Oh, I got to do this. Oh, I got to do that. Oh, I better do this or else this bad thing will happen or whatever else. And this is the normal worldly way of getting ourselves to, you know, be motivated and such. But we don't need that. And it's a hell of a lot better when we just recognize the reality of the situation and and say, wow, it's really great that I have this opportunity to get up and go do this thing that's going to help my body out. Oh, I'm going to feel good. And I feel good doing it because I know I'm doing something wholesome, taking care of myself. So, you know, and really exercise, no exercise, whatever it is, I really want to be able to look at it and say, wow, look at these really great things that are happening right now. And it's— I find that that's very helpful.

**Speaker A:** That's awesome. Anybody else have anything they want to say on that subject to what Alexander said?

**Speaker C:** Maybe I can add something.

**Speaker A:** Do you hear me?

**Speaker F:** Perfect.

**Speaker C:** So what came up for me is just I recently started running again, and it's been like over some years a lot of ups and downs with the running, because always when I started to run again, I wanted to be like already at this like level where I run every day. And this kind of, yeah, made me stop eventually because like I couldn't keep up with that. And Yeah, right now when I just started again and also thinking of the Dharma, it's a lot just that I go for a run when I really want it and I really enjoy it and I feel like it's like the right thing to do right now. And not because I want anything particular out of it or like because I want like a future benefit of it, just because it feels so good right now to do this to my body. And this actually, this keeps me, yeah, running for quite some time right now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there's definitely nothing wrong with physical exercise. That's why I like Bodhidharma when he introduced Zen to China from India. They call him like the grandfather of the Shaolin kung fu dudes. And when the Shaolin guys are stretching especially, you really see the Indian influence of the yoga. It almost looks like you're in Delhi or something. It looks like the Indians, the way they practice yoga, the asanas, you know, the different postures and stuff. So yeah, and like Dhammarato says too, exercise is wonderful, just like many things in life. But also you can remain healthy just by never exercising. Having a positive mindset, a healthy attitude, this will keep you the most healthy in spite of the body that will inevitably get old, get sick, and die. But yeah, there's nothing wrong with exercise. It's wonderful. But if you can't or don't want to, that's okay too.

**Speaker D:** One thing I like to do when I'm feeling a bit lethargic or lacking motivation to exercise, I'll try to do— so I do yoga as well, right? But I try to do like flexibility training to like strengthen my joints, tendons, and like bodily limits, I guess. Because one thing I really enjoy is like setting up myself for success. And I know if I'm going to do this flexibility training, when I'm like in 40, 50 years, if I just keep on, because it's not that hard to do like 10 minutes in the morning and 10 minutes in the evening, I'm going to be feeling good in my body, I'm going to be happy, and it's going to be a rewarding cycle that I get in. And then that brings me a lot of happiness and joy and Sukkha. So yeah. That's what I like to do. You don't have to exercise every day. Exercise when you can. Flexible— do flexibility training when you can. Keep yourself active. Yeah, that's what I like to do.

**Speaker A:** That's awesome, dude. Anybody else like exercise or want to talk about anything else Dharma-related? Yeah, I like how he said about like smiling is great, but then not needing to smile is also great. Because I'm at the gym now, and I'm usually just smiling and happy. But I went into like beast mode, like serious straight face. And that was great too. So I enjoyed that. I think as long as the heart is smiling, the heart and the mind is smiling. Physical smiling is wonderful. But it's like wearing fancy clothes. They look nice and they are nice. Sometimes people wearing fancy clothes aren't necessarily the most rich. Sometimes people smiling aren't necessarily the most happy. Sometimes somebody with a resting bitch face is the happiest person ever. So don't get too caught up on the physical act But more so, as long as you know yourself, if you— if in your own heart you're happy, then you know you're on the right path. And nobody can tell you. Nobody can tell you because the way you look you're on the right path. You have to know it for yourself. Like Ajahn Chah used to say, a lot of Buddhists that he knew, they would be so pleased that they could sit for such long periods. They would sit for days. And he said, you know, Ajahn Chah said, you know, I know a lot of roosters and hens, hens that just sit around, you know, the hens are on top of their eggs, they sit there for months sometimes. And he's like, are they enlightened? Are they Buddhist? Are they Dharma practitioners? You know, it's like, because they're great sitters, you know. But ultimately, the earnestness of our pursuit is what matters. Are you seeing results within yourself? In a way, when you look in the mirror. Everybody could smile in front of people. Can you smile when you're by yourself alone in a room? That's when the smiling really matters. Can you smile in traffic? Can you smile when you get diagnosed with a debilitating illness? That's something else. But anybody else have anything they want to talk about?

**Speaker F:** Maybe like one point, still going back to the exercise. I think doing the Anapanasati with like gradually easier forms of exercise can be really good. Like for example, starting with yoga, noticing the sensations in the body from stretching. Does the mind go, "I don't like this sensation, this doesn't feel good." You know, seeing that with joy, congratulating, seeing what the mind is doing when we exercise, and can we practice Anapanasati the same time, you know. And then doing some heavier physical activity, it feels like if we go there, like with a relaxed mind, a relaxed body, maybe it we get more out of it. Maybe we get more benefit from the exercise that way as well, and we enjoy it more.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** I completely agree with that. So I started like doing formal yoga classes like, uh, maybe 2-3 weeks ago, and, um, yeah, it's hard, but when I'm, uh, focusing on my breath and telling myself I'm happy, you know, I signed up for this, I'm, I'm perfectly safe, I'm enjoying this, I get more out of it. And secondly, onto that, so I'm trying to study French, Dutch, and Brazilian Portuguese. I find returning to the breath and like being mindful whilst I study like actually makes it easier to study, makes my learnings easier, like it stays longer in my head. I feel that it's such a Swiss Army knife, Anapanasati, like it's all aspects of your life get better when you start focusing on it. So yeah, I completely agree.

**Speaker A:** That's awesome.

**Speaker B:** I'd like to ask now, since the topic of Anapanasati has been brought up, I mean, I've certainly heard Dhammarato talk about it lots and lots and lots and lots of times, but I'd really like to hear about what maybe some of you guys do that with your practice, what really got you into the Anapanasati practice? Because that's— yeah, I know it, and you know, I don't do— I just need to practice it more, that's it. So if you got some good tips, I'd take them.

**Speaker C:** Actually, I would just bring up what Dhamma Das taught me. And like, I heard a lot about the practice, and actually what Dhamma Das kept saying was just, can you just breathe in and everything is just fine, it's just okay. And as simple as that, nothing much to it, I would say. And for me personally, like, let's say in a situation where I meditate or try to sit down and meditate, I don't— like, it helps me a lot when it's just simple and just, wow, I can breathe, how amazing is it that I can breathe. And whatever happens around me, there are so many things that are constantly changing, but what keeps me here always is the breath. I can breathe in and it's fine, it's my decision, it's all good.

**Speaker A:** Very good. Anybody else have anything to say on tips for David, on Anapanasati?

**Speaker F:** Yeah, how I practice it? Really sometimes I might even focus more on the, what's going on in the mind, like how does the mind react to all kind of sensations, what are the attitudes there? And if that can't be noticed, or if that's not clear, just like looking but the thoughts are there. And yeah, creating with some kind of wholesome thought with the in-breath, maybe something that brings a little bit more joy. I'm like, wow, everything is really okay right now, isn't that wonderful? And then the out-breath, I can just relax here, nothing else to do. You know, maybe sticking to one kind of wholesome thought or improvising all the time. I really like to improvise. You know, creating different, different thoughts that, that brings me, like that brings it fresh. And then when the mind starts to quiet down, you know, maybe only do one thought with the whole in and out breath. And then, you know, and every time you notice those attitudes of, I don't like this, or I want something else, or thoughts saying that this is not good enough, something like that, just congratulating them with joy. Wow, isn't that wonderful? I see what the mind.

**Speaker C:** Is doing.

**Speaker F:** Congratulations.

**Speaker A:** Very good. Very well said.

**Speaker B:** I really like that. Thank you, Thomas. I don't know if I said your name right, but thank you. I really appreciate that because I don't do much meditation, haven't done much meditation. I certainly could do it, but I haven't been doing it just because I've been slacking in that particular area. And I think that advice is very useful just because I do have things come up when I have sat and just saying, oh, isn't it wonderful that I can recognize that? That's the positive twist that I think I really need to make. I need to just keep twisting towards the positive because that's the point. That's the right effort to get to the right attitude so that we can have the right action and live the right livelihood.

**Speaker D:** And then congratulate yourself for having those right thoughts. Like, have an even more wholesome thought, and then have another wholesome thought, and then it goes on.

**Speaker A:** And David, you don't always have to— it's good at the beginning sometimes to do like the classical kind of meditation, but you know, I always hear people say like, I don't have the time, or I try to do it and this, and it's like You know, it's just existing peacefully. It's just breathing and relaxing. It's remembering to breathe and relax, that everything's okay here and now. This is what people are referring to when they refer to meditation, is the Sati, is the Anapanasati, is the Noble Eightfold Path. It could be done in war. It could be done at work. It could be done when you are sitting, when you are laying. In any posture throughout your day. For the beginners, we tell them like, yes, in a balanced way, start maybe 6 or 7 times. But really, the secret is it's not a chore, it's a joy that can be done. It's not can be done, it's like we should be honored and relieved that it's possible to be done in a lifestyle, not just at 5-minute periods here and there, in every single moment. Like Dhammarato says, all life is a series of mind moments, moment after moment after moment. If you say next Tuesday I'm going to practice sitting down meditating, then you have all these mind moments that are getting born and dying into anger, into joy, getting too attached to happiness, getting attached to sadness, getting attached to coming out of sadness. All these mind moments, that's just dukkha, dukkha, dukkha, dukkha, dukkha. And I'll say I'll save Dukkha and Nirodha for next Tuesday. It's silly. You know, we want Dukkha and Nirodha every mind moment if we can. And once we learn to recognize that— for the beginners, they do a little bit here and a little bit there because they're just starting to recognize, oh, this is the Noble Eightfold Path, or doorway rather. Then once you realize it's not a path, it's a doorway to be done here and now. You know, then it really is something you can't stay away from. You become addicted to— everybody wants to attach to an I, me, my mind. Everybody wants to attach to identity. Attach to your practice. If you want to scrape and strive like a monster, like a rat, strive for the Dhamma practice. Yeah, if you want to be greedy and selfish for something, be selfish for practicing. And then the practice, remember, is just the finger pointing at the moon. The moon itself is the fruit that's born from the practice. And that is what I like to call, what Bodhidharma likes to call in Zen, our true nature, which is just peace and emptiness and Sukkha and joy. And the baby Dukkhas will arise. And then we've already cleared out our garden, so we just take out the baby Dukkhas as they run. And the baby Dukkhas will never go away. They're part of the Dharma. The baby dukkhas are part of nature. And you think, I've been practicing 8 years, here comes more dukkha. That's the way it is. It's not a problem. So practice is always, and it's a joy, and it's easy. It's not something— but the classical meditation, the classical yoga, the asanas, that is extremely difficult. That is. It's not easy to get in those pretzel postures and sit for 10 hours. It's not. But it's just like any other useless talent, you know, it's a tool. You use it for what it is. If you happen to like asanas in yoga, go for it. If you happen to like karate, go for it. But that's not the Dharma practice. But those things can be incorporated into the Dharma practice, no doubt.

**Speaker B:** Wow, I really like that, Dhammarato, the gratitude to practice now. I'm going to make that a priority for myself, that I'm Anagami. And I also heard from Tomas as well, and the twisting it to make it a grateful experience. And also one thing I just want to say, because you said it and I wrote it down in my journal, I loved it so much, Dhammarato. You said every moment is a Buddhist holy day.

**Speaker A:** I don't remember saying that, but If it helps you, go for it. Sounds good. That's awesome. Well, anybody else have anything to say on any Dhamma subjects whatsoever? Now's the time. No better time than now. We love hearing from everybody. Anybody who hasn't talked in a while want to say something? Don't be afraid. That's okay, silence is all too satisfied. Yeah, we're all too satisfied. Were you gonna say something, Thomas?

**Speaker F:** Yeah, I would just like to say to David that, you know, the joy that I seem to get from you now, you know, that seems to be like a huge fuel for the practice. So you got it already, keep it up. And, you know, yeah.

**Speaker E:** Yes, I did. Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I have.

**Speaker E:** That's absolutely correct. Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Thank you everyone who's replied to me in this call. I really appreciate it. I feel like this is a real Sangha call. We really came together.

**Speaker A:** Thank you.

**Speaker F:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And let's be careful not to get in the mindset of somebody else has something I want. It's very easy in these spiritual practices, so-called spiritual practices, where we say, oh, they got it, but I want it. Realize everybody, you're all Buddhas. You're all enlightened masters already. Just allow yourself to be that way and don't get attached when the web, spider web of the mind comes knocking and you get all caught up in the weeds, caught up in the spider web. That's where the confusion is. Ironically, when you give up this stuff, you're already a Buddha, you're already free. Just don't start wrapping yourself up in chains. Of the mind, and you'll be good. You know, everything in life is, I can't wait to get ahead, I can't wait for the future to have happiness. The reason I always love the Dharma practice and discover it more and more in each moment is because you have the reward there. You are the Buddha. I'm not just saying that as a poetic thing. You are fully enlightened beings. It's amazing. Just don't get caught up in this bullshit of liking and disliking, of birth and death, of who's better, who's not better, who's wearing the robes, who's not wearing the robes, who knows the canon better than this, who is a Christian and who's an atheist, who's a Satanist, who's this— who gives a fuck? It's all Anicca, Dukkha, Nada. It will do you no good. It'll serve you no purpose. Thought is your enemy, as U.G. Krishnamurti famously said. I know that's kind of a dichotomy, kind of making it a black and white issue, but I don't mind. I like it. Thought is your enemy. It could be your enemy or it could be your best friend. You have to decide. But anyway, guys, I'm probably gonna get going soon unless anybody else has anything they'd like to to say. This has been a great call so far, and we all— we always enjoy hearing you guys who enjoy talking about the Dharma. Don't be afraid. It takes some time to be on camera and talk about it. So if there is something, please.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I would say from experience— oh, sorry. Yeah, go ahead, Samatha.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, I would like to say just, yeah, beautiful Dhamma, Dhamma. Thank you. And you know, I'd like to say to people, if you feel a bit like shy to go the camera or something, like you might screw it up. It's okay to screw it up, you know. We can joyfully screw it up. Isn't that fun? You know.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah. I was just gonna thank Dhammarato for hosting these calls because they do a lot for us. Well, I mean, I know they do a lot for me, so I know they do a lot for us.

**Speaker A:** You're amazing. I love all you guys and girls. You, uh You all do a lot for me because just like Dhammarato says, when we're teaching the Dharma, when we're guiding, when we're talking about the Dharma and Sangha, teaching— all of you should become teachers because that's the best way to learn. I'm not talking about it because I know everything. I'm talking about it because I want to remind myself because I'll forget. You know, I'm practicing Sati when I'm talking. And that's why I'm always encouraging on my videos everybody else to get involved, because I want you guys to practice with me if possible. But much peace and love. And yeah, I guess the other call is Dhammarato's on this weekend or something, I think. So that'll be cool. And anybody who's on Discord, follow me on Discord if you can, because then I can add you to our other server of a Zen server that's just another branch of all this stuff. And also go to— yeah, yeah, follow me on Discord, and then I'll be able to— once you're my friend, it only lets me if you're my friend. I don't know why, but once you're my friend, I'll accept it, then I can add you to our server. And also go to opensanghafoundation.org. It's a beautiful website, and it is— if you've been on it recently, it's much more updated than it used to be. So I would highly recommend you check it out. And thanks to Dhammarato. Thanks What's that, buddy?

**Speaker C:** When do these video calls on the Sangha Foundation actually start? I just recently saw these like video kind of button at the bottom right, something like.

**Speaker A:** You might have to ask somebody on here or Mickey, because I'm not too sure what they're doing with that on the website. I need to get on there more myself. Yeah, but yeah, yeah, shoot Mickey a text and he'll probably answer that for you. Um, but that's cool that they're doing that. But much peace and love, everybody. Uh, yeah, let's all make friends with each other, get to know each other more. You guys are awesome, and I'll see you guys next time. Bye-bye, guys.

**Speaker D:** Thank you, thank you, guys.

**Speaker A:** Bye. I love you. Adios.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk centers on a practitioner's question about **Piti** (rapture/joy) and **Sukkha** (happiness/bliss) in meditation, and evolves into a broader discussion on integrating the Dharma into daily life. Here is a summary of the key themes:

### **Core Question & Teachings**
*   **Speaker B** shares a breakthrough: the ability to clear the mind, recognize that most threats are "just words and imagination," and return to a baseline of "everything is okay." He then asks for clarification on **Piti** (which he finds elusive) and **Sukkha** (which he understands as a deep, relaxing "okayness").
*   **The Nature of Piti & Sukkha:** The group describes them as interconnected:
    *   **Piti** is the **"wow factor"**—the exhilarating joy and confidence that arises from seeing the practice work. It's the relief and excitement of knowing "I can do this," the energy that rouses continued practice. One analogy given: *Piti is seeing water while thirsty and knowing you can reach it; Sukkha is actually drinking it.*
    *   **Sukkha** is the **peaceful, contented happiness** that follows—the deep relaxation and fulfillment.
*   **Cultivation:** They emphasize that these states are cultivated **not by forcing them, but by noticing and celebrating** moments of correct practice. The attitude is key: "Wow, it's nice to be okay right now." This joyful recognition itself generates more Piti.

### **Personal Journey & Integration**
*   **Speaker E (Alexander)** shares his inspiring journey. He came to the Dharma about two years ago, dealing with dissatisfaction from military service and family issues. He found Dhammarato's teachings remarkably simple and practical, and was struck by his joy and willingness to teach freely.
*   His progress came from **consistent practice, immediate results, and developing dispassion** toward old, unwholesome mental habits. He describes the practice as gaining its own momentum, like pushing a swing—hard at first, then just occasional taps to keep it going.

### **Applying Dharma to Daily Life**
The conversation naturally expands into how to bring a mindful, joyful attitude to everyday activities:
*   **Exercise:** The group discusses reframing physical activity. Instead of a chore driven by fear or obligation, it becomes an opportunity for gratitude: *"Wow, it's really great that my body can move like this."* This makes the activity itself enjoyable and sustainable.
*   **Anapanasati (Mindfulness of Breathing):** Practical tips are shared:
    *   Keep it simple: "Can you just breathe in and everything is just fine?"
    *   Use wholesome thoughts with the breath (e.g., "Everything is okay" on the in-breath, "I can relax" on the out-breath).
    *   **Congratulate yourself joyfully** when you notice the mind wandering—see it as a success of awareness, not a failure.
*   **The Essence of Practice:** A key point is that formal sitting is just one part. **True practice is moment-to-moment**, applying the "doorway" of the Noble Eightfold Path throughout the day—in traffic, at work, while studying. The goal is to make every moment a "Buddhist holy day."

### **Overall Tone & Conclusion**
The talk is characterized by **warmth, support, and shared joy**. The Sangha (community) acts as a supportive space to discuss practice, celebrate successes, and encourage each other. The final reminders emphasize:
*   You already have the nature of a Buddha; don't get tangled in the "spider web" of comparative or negative thinking.
*   Teaching and sharing the Dharma with others is a powerful way to deepen your own practice.
*   The foundation is **joyful, present-moment acceptance**: breathing in and recognizing, "Everything is actually okay right now."

**In essence, the talk moves from a specific question about meditation factors to the heart of the pragmatic Dharma: cultivating a joyful, relaxed, and confident attitude in every aspect of life, supported by a community of friends on the path.**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several metaphors and stories to explain the Dharma concepts, primarily **Piti** (rapture/joy) and **Sukha** (happiness/bliss), and the practice itself. Here's a breakdown:

### **Metaphors & Stories Used:**

**1. The Hot Iron Ball (Attributed to Ajahn Chah)**
*   **Speaker:** A
*   **Context:** Explaining how to deal with triggering thoughts and mental suffering.
*   **Metaphor:** The mind in distress is like a **hot iron ball**. No matter how you try to grasp or control it (with aversion, identification, etc.), you get burned. The solution is not control, but wise observation and letting go.

**2. Piti as the "Wow" Factor / Seeing Water While Thirsty**
*   **Speakers:** A & E
*   **Context:** Defining Piti (joy/rapture) in contrast to Sukha (bliss).
*   **Metaphors:**
    *   **The "Wow" Factor:** Piti is the exhilarating feeling of *"wow, I can actually do this!"*—the confidence and joy of realizing the practice works.
    *   **Seeing Water While Thirsty:** Piti is like the joyful anticipation and energy you feel **when you see water and know you can reach it**. Sukha is the contentment **when you actually drink the water**.

**3. Sukha as Drinking the Water / Relaxing into the Moment**
*   **Speakers:** B & E
*   **Context:** Defining Sukha (happiness/bliss).
*   **Metaphors:**
    *   **Drinking the Water:** As above, Sukha is the satisfaction of having attained the relief you anticipated.
    *   **The Deep Relaxing Breath:** Speaker B describes it intuitively as the feeling of taking a deep breath and relaxing into the moment, knowing everything is okay.

**4. The Path as "Not What We've Done Before" / Pushing a Child on a Swing**
*   **Speaker:** E (Alexander)
*   **Context:** Describing the development of a sustained practice.
*   **Metaphors:**
    *   **A New Path:** Progress means noticing and abandoning old, habitual mental patterns ("oh, this sucks," "poor me"). The path is fundamentally different from these past reactions.
    *   **Pushing a Swing:** At first, practice requires effort, like **pushing a child on a swing**. But as momentum builds, it requires less force—you're just **giving it occasional taps**. Eventually, you can just **joyfully watch it swing**, maintaining it with minimal, mindful adjustments.

**5. The Hen Sitting on Eggs**
*   **Speaker:** A
*   **Context:** Cautioning against mistaking external forms (like long meditation sits) for genuine progress.
*   **Story/Metaphor:** Ajahn Chah joked that many people pride themselves on sitting for long periods, but **hens sit on eggs for months**. The point isn't the physical act of sitting, but the **earnestness and internal results** of the practice.

**6. The Garden and Baby Dukkhas**
*   **Speaker:** A
*   **Context:** Explaining that practice is ongoing, not a final state.
*   **Metaphor:** A well-maintained practice is like a **cleared-out garden**. **"Baby dukkhas"** (small sufferings, negative thoughts) will always arise like weeds. The practice isn't to stop them from ever appearing, but to **gently remove them as they come**, preventing them from taking over.

**7. The Finger Pointing at the Moon**
*   **Speaker:** A
*   **Context:** Distinguishing the tools of practice from the goal.
*   **Metaphor:** The specific practices (meditation, yoga, etc.) are just **the finger pointing at the moon**. The **moon** is the true goal: peace, emptiness, and true nature. Don't confuse the pointer (the method) with the destination (the fruit of the practice).

**8. Don't Wrap Yourself in Chains**
*   **Speaker:** A
*   **Context:** Encouraging the recognition of one's inherent potential for peace.
*   **Metaphor:** We are already "Buddhas" or free in our true nature. Suffering comes when we **actively wrap ourselves in chains** of liking/disliking, comparison, and identity. Freedom is found in **not picking up those chains**.

**9. The Spider Web of the Mind**
*   **Speaker:** A
*   **Context:** Warning about getting caught in mental complexity.
*   **Metaphor:** The mind's tendencies to create stories, judgments, and confusion are like a **spider web**. Getting "caught up in the weeds" or the "spider web" leads us away from simple, present-moment awareness.

### **Summary of Key Themes:**
The metaphors collectively paint a picture of the Dharma practice as:
*   **A relief** from carrying burdens (hot iron ball, chains).
*   **A joyful discovery** of innate capability (the "wow" factor, seeing water).
*   **A natural process** of building momentum (pushing a swing).
*   **A simple, ongoing maintenance** of mental well-being (gardening, tapping the swing).
*   **An internal shift** that matters more than external appearances (hen sitting vs. earnest practice).
*   **A direct experience** where the method is not the goal (finger pointing at the moon).
