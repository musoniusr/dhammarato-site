### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Got the blue, the blue dot going. So sweet. Yeah. All right everyone, welcome to, um, the UK Sangha. Uh, I think it's Wednesday. Yeah, I think it's, it's like 12 in the middle of the day here. For you guys it's nighttime, right? Or DJ? 9 PM. Oh, 3. Cool. Yeah, 3. Yeah, perfect. All right, so does anyone have anything they would like to share? Any— we were just talking about effective practice and— hello, welcome. Hey, what's up, man? We're just getting into it. We're talking about effective practice and how the only real useful approach is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha approach. Because I've been a lot of different places around the spiritual marketplace, so to speak, and spiritual ideas all the way from non-duality to Advaita, which is obviously non-duality, and then I'm trying to think where else I've been on the YouTube gurus. Any like awakening-centered or like spirituality, like school of thought, like I'm familiar with. So like I can like confidently say like I've been there, done that, and like every single tradition and like The only one that works is the Buddha, the Dhamma. The only way that's gonna make you happy is the Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha approach. And then there's certain things, a certain path to follow in order to accomplish that. And it's very replicable. And it's like Even within Buddhism, there's a lot of different offshoots and different schools of thoughts. And most of them are just like other non-dual traditions. They don't work. They're too concerned and they're too wrapped up in the ideas of it. Essentially replacing their belief systems with new spiritual belief systems. And that doesn't make you happy. But like practicing Anapanasati and gladdening the minds, and then seeing the effective mindfulness of your body and feelings actually gives you the tool, the toolkit to change how you're feeling and re-engineer how you experience your mind and your body, which is essentially that's Dukkha, Nirodha, because the only thing that's on your plate to deal with is your mind and your body. So the first thing you got to do is you got to stop whining and complaining about the world, because that's not where you live. So like, that's the first step. I know I'm going on a tangent here, but like, this is more interesting. The first step is— and I was reading this in a sutta earlier today— having put away grief and covetousness, covetousness for the world. Ardent and fully aware, he becomes mindful. Breathing in long, I breathe in long. And then breathing in long, breathing in, I become aware of the body, etc. But having put away grief and covetousness for the world. So most people's hindrances and most people's Dukkha, it comes from some sort of griping about the world. Like, it's not the way you want it to be, and or someone wronged you, right? Someone, this person, like I'm a victim of this person, or why don't I have, or like I wish I had this, or like I'm like, oh, poor me, like I don't have enough money. I'm not good looking enough. I'm not this and that. Like, it all has to do with like the world. And like, that's pretty much the primary source of Dukkha for humans, because humans are social animals. So like, everything's all your thinking and like mental talk is centered around like other people and like what other people think of you and stuff like that. So, but But all the world is a fabrication, and everything you experience, everything you feel about the world is conditioned by the mental talk you have about it. So that is all fabrication. So first, where you actually live, like where you actually experience is, is the feelings, the mind, and the body. So the five aggregates, right? And so first thing you do is you have to wake up out of complaining and whining and being a victim of the world. And then you can become fully aware of like what's actually going on and like where you're actually experiencing. And where you're actually experiencing is where like the full spectrum of your experience, which contains a lot of different moving parts like thoughts, sight, touch, sound, etc. And then once you wake up to see the actual experience of the moment unfolding, then you can really see like the unwholesome thoughts. Instead of being busy complaining about the world, you're seeing like the mechanism of complaining about the world itself. And then you can gladden the mind. So you can just change it up like with wholesome thoughts, or you can straight just throw it out completely. If you can just throw it out, gladdening the mind is like Like giving yourself wholesome thoughts, like there's nothing to do, nowhere to go, just kind of calm you down. There's like training wheels, okay? This is like an introductory practice that is useful. It's really good. It's like one Dhammarato gives. But I'd say for a more advanced practitioner, you can just simply throw it out completely and then become aware of the breath and the body. Which is Anapanasati. So just once you become fully aware of the breath as it's happening and fully aware of the body as it's happening, then you can start to relax like tensions in the body and stuff like that. And then once you start to relax your body and come into your experience as it's happening right now, and the mind is pure, the mind is rid of hindrances, then the process of Jhana starts to unfold. So once the mind is rid of any craving or aversion, or I like the theme I'm going on today is griping about the world. So once you're free of griping about the world and all the people who have wronged you and stuff like that. You're just sitting in this moment with your breath and your body. And then that's a lot less disturbing than all of the mental talk about things have gone wrong in the past or things that could go wrong in the future. So now that you've simplified things into this moment, you can actually relax the body and the mind becomes pure, pure of hindrances, pure of like nagging, nagging thoughts. And.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points shared by Speaker A:

**Core Thesis:** The only truly effective spiritual practice is the Buddha's **Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha** approach (identifying suffering, understanding its origin, and realizing its cessation). The speaker contrasts this with many other traditions (non-duality, Advaita, various Buddhist schools) that often just replace old belief systems with new spiritual ones without leading to genuine happiness.

**The Primary Source of Dukkha:** For most people, suffering arises from **"griping about the world"**—complaining, feeling victimized, coveting what we don't have, or resenting how others have treated us. This mental chatter about the external, social world is the main hindrance.

**The Crucial First Step:** One must **"put away grief and covetousness for the world."** This means waking up from the story of being a victim of external circumstances. Since the "world" we experience is a mental fabrication, real practice begins by turning attention to where we *actually* live: **the five aggregates (body, feelings, perceptions, mental formations, consciousness).**

**The Practical Path:**
1.  **Shift Attention Inward:** Stop focusing on external complaints and instead observe the **mechanism of complaining itself** as it unfolds in the mind and body.
2.  **Gladden the Mind:** Use wholesome thoughts to calm and soothe the mind. The speaker notes this is like "training wheels"—a foundational practice taught by Dhammarato.
3.  **Advanced Option:** For a more established practitioner, one can simply **discard unwholesome thoughts** entirely and directly move to mindfulness of breath and body.
4.  **Practice Ānāpānasati:** With a mind free from griping, become **fully aware of the breath and body** in the present moment. This allows you to relax bodily tensions.
5.  **Result:** When the mind is purified of hindrances (craving, aversion, nagging thoughts) and the body is relaxed, the conditions are set for **jhāna** (meditative absorption) to naturally unfold.

**In Essence:** The talk outlines a pragmatic, replicable path: Stop getting lost in stories about the external world, turn awareness to the immediate experience of mind and body, use mindfulness of breath to calm and purify the mind, and this creates the stillness necessary for deeper meditative states and genuine happiness.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this excerpt, the speaker uses several key metaphors and references a story to explain their point about effective spiritual practice.

Here are the metaphors and stories identified:

### Metaphors

1.  **The Spiritual Marketplace:** The speaker refers to exploring different spiritual traditions as being in a "spiritual marketplace." This metaphor frames spirituality as a space with various "products" or "schools of thought" one can browse or try out.
2.  **The Toolkit:** The Buddha's teachings (specifically *Anapanasati* or mindfulness of breathing) are described as a **"toolkit."** This metaphor emphasizes practicality—these are concrete instruments you use to "re-engineer" your experience, not just abstract ideas.
3.  **Training Wheels:** The practice of "gladdening the mind" with wholesome thoughts is compared to **"training wheels."** This metaphor suggests it's a helpful, supportive practice for beginners, but the goal is to advance beyond it to a more direct method ("just throw it out completely").
4.  **What's On Your Plate:** The speaker says, "the only thing that's on your plate to deal with is your mind and your body." This **metaphor of a plate** signifies one's immediate responsibility and sphere of control. You can't deal with the external "world" directly; you can only work with the experience (mind and body) presented to you.
5.  **Waking Up:** The process of shifting focus from the world to one's direct experience is described as having to **"wake up out of complaining."** This is a common metaphor for gaining insight or awareness, moving from a deluded state to a clear one.
6.  **The Mechanism:** When you stop complaining *about* the world, you start to see **"the mechanism of complaining about the world itself."** This metaphor frames unwholesome mental patterns as a piece of machinery or a process that can be observed and understood internally.

### Story / Sutta Reference

The speaker references a specific Buddhist text (a **sutta**) to anchor their first point:
*   **The Story/Instruction:** They paraphrase from a sutta (likely the *Anapanasati Sutta* or a related text): **"having put away grief and covetousness for the world. Ardent and fully aware, he becomes mindful. Breathing in long, I breathe in long..."**
*   **How it's used:** This story or instruction is used as the authoritative starting point for their entire argument. It provides the scriptural basis for the first step: letting go of grief and longing directed at the external world (*covetousness for the world*) as a prerequisite for true mindfulness and effective practice.

### Central Analogical Theme
While not a single metaphor, the speaker sets up a powerful **contrast between two "locations" or realms of experience**:
*   **The World (Fabrication):** Described as a source of "griping," where people live as "victims." It's portrayed as a mental fabrication, a story conditioned by our thoughts about other people and past/future events.
*   **The Mind & Body (Actual Experience):** Described as "where you actually live," "where you're actually experiencing," and "the full spectrum of your experience." This is presented as the real, immediate, and workable domain.

This contrast is the core framework for their talk: happiness is found by abandoning the first "location" (the world of stories) and fully attending to the second (the direct experience of mind and body).
