### Transcript


**Speaker A:** You may be right, but it's not a good wholesome thing to do. Being right is not always wholesome. And yet in our society, being right seems to be the only criteria. It just cut out at that time. What's her name?

**Speaker B:** Uh, her name is Shishi.

**Speaker A:** Sishi.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, my girlfriend named her. That was like— that's— I don't know where she got the name from, but it kind of— it was kind of a nickname and it stuck. Like, the last time I talked to you, I was afraid she was going to do the same thing. She just— whenever I'm on the computer, that's when she likes to get up on me. But she was asleep last time, and this time she kind of woke up and next thing you know, there she was. Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's what she's there for, is for being a pet.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** And so that's what she's wanting. She's wanting to be petted.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker A:** And it also has to do with time structure. I mean, if you were a cat or you were a dog living in somebody's house and they fed you and your only job was to either bark when you hit a noise or to lay about and be happy. She's just doing her job.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah,

**Speaker A:** which is— yeah, she's getting

**Speaker B:** ready to— she's getting ready to wake me up in the next couple hours. When I go to bed, that's when she'll— she'll usually lay down in the bed with me for about an hour or two, and then around 12 or 1 o'clock, this little switch comes on and it says run around the house and go crazy. And that's pretty much what she'll do.

**Speaker A:** Well, with the remarkable point about the easy life that most American house pets have, if there is a thing like rebirth or reincarnation, then I would choose being a house dog.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker A:** Anagami, house cat would be the second choice.

**Speaker B:** I don't know if I remember if I told you last time we spoke, there's a monk, a Theravada monk that I will go get breakfast to on Sundays. And he was talking about my cat the other day. And he was talking about, well, I guess if you're going to talk about rebirth and a cat, They have it, or pets have it the best, because they're not really having to kill anything, so there's no real bad karma. It's like they just got it easy. I was like, yep, she will. She'll, if she— I told him, well, if she sees a bug in the house periodically, and she will, she'll definitely go after it. It's like it's that evolutionary instinct, you know, just kicks right in.

**Speaker A:** You just made a really, really interesting point there through the monk. And that is, is that when the dogs are barking, or when the cat's chasing a mouse, or when the cat is chasing a bug that she catches— and these dogs here, being in the kind of neighborhood that we have, uh, in the past 8 or 10 years we have had 4 or 5 episodes with roosters And when the rooster from one of the neighbors, uh, uh, gets loose and comes into this territory, the dogs will chase that rooster down. And the question is, is can the humans get to the rooster before the dogs kill it? And if there's only one dog chasing a rooster, the rooster generally wins. But when two dogs are chasing the rooster, the rooster doesn't have much of a chance.

**Speaker B:** No, not at all.

**Speaker A:** Uh, even if it can fly a little bit, it doesn't fly far enough. So the point that I'm making is, is that this behavior of the dogs is instinctual. It's as instinctual as people jumping when they hear a loud noise— gun goes off right behind your head— and we jump. Right? It's an instinctual reaction. Okay, human killing is almost never an instinctual reaction. For one thing, it's too hard to kill a human. Okay, unless you've got modern guns, and then you could say that that's the case, that in fact people do get killed with modern weapons simply because all it takes is just the instinctual pulling of a trigger.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** Okay, if we look at it from that perspective, then we need to look at our instincts, to look at our bad behavior, because the bad behavior that is not acceptable in human society is generally because people are acting out of their instincts rather than acting out of knowledge. The dogs and cats, they don't have that kind of knowledge. They don't have that kind of memory. In fact, it's really interesting like that, that this is actually commonplace, that you can actually punish or abuse a dog in the morning and he'll be all friendly to that person in the afternoon. It's all about it. You abuse a person, they'll remember it for years.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so this is a point that we have to understand about instincts and, let us say, memory and wisdom and that kind of thing, so that we can then understand the Buddha's points about what is morality. Because what that monk said was basically a child's or a beginner's view of morality. And this is the typical way that is taught. But there is a more adult way of looking at morality. And in the child's position of morality, the normal way that we look at it is that we make morality a set of rules or standards to live by. But if we have it from, let us call it, rather than the adult position, we look at it from the noble position, so that when someone like the Buddha or like an old-time meditator or someone who is practicing correctly and they get to the point to where their mind is pure and they have only wholesome thoughts, Then with wholesome and only wholesome thoughts, the mind becomes completely organized and unified. And with that, then, because that person does not want anything, he's unlikely to go out and kill for it. If he doesn't want anything, he's unlikely to go out and take it from someone. Kleptomania, white-collar crime, you know, the whole different range of various stealings that we have. If you don't want anything, you don't do any of that stuff. And if your heart is right, if you have the mind that's pure, doesn't have any ill will, or any competition for others. And in competition, if we're not competing with others, then we're probably not gossiping about them, not telling lies about them. And in that regard, then our speech becomes pure. So what I'm pointing at is that in the real teachings of the Buddha, The morality is not a set of guidelines to live up to on the path to, uh, let us say, wisdom. It's rather that gaining wisdom right here, right now, is the better way of going, because when you have wisdom, your morality is perfect. And cats don't have that. They don't have a sense of right or wrong. All they have is a sense of the instinct. In fact, your cat probably doesn't even know its name. Cats are like that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Where the dogs, they will at least know their name. You can— we've got one of the dogs named Lucky, and I can say Lucky, Lucky, Lucky, or I could say Lucky in a different way many, many times, and I know that she understands because she'll If she's laying on the floor, you can hear her bang her tail on the floor.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** So she knows her name, and Poon Pui knows her name too. But when we've had cats from time to time, the cat— basically the problem is, is that the cats leave. These dogs, they own the place.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But cats don't tend to know their name very well. They don't respond in that way. So, the point that I'm making about morality is that there's various levels of it, and that we have to start someplace. If we didn't have any morality at all, then everyone would have wrong view, which means that we would have chaos. And in fact, human human behavior or human society is set up is that the only way to not have absolute chaos, absolute bedlam, barbarism, is because we have social rules or social conventions. Those social rules or social conventions actually go right back into our DNA. That animals have rules and social conventions. The way the dogs operate together for the chicken, they know that the other dog is there and that they cooperate. Okay. Also, uh, there's many other behaviors that animals have that's very, very, um, let us say, revealing about human nature or human behavior. An example of that is, especially dogs, not so much cats, but especially dogs, it's their nature, it's their instinctual behavior, the nesting instinct, that whoever the dogs decide is going to be their alpha or the leader of their pack, they want to be in the vicinity of that alpha leader, especially at night. That's why the dogs want to sleep in bed with us. It's not the bed. It's not the bed. It is in fact the instinct, the nesting instinct that the dogs have. Okay, the nesting instinct can be phrased as going along to get along. Which means to follow.

**Speaker B:** Can you hear me?

**Speaker A:** Okay, you're back. Great.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so we were talking about what do wildebeests do when they find a lion in the vicinity? What do lions do? Excuse me, what do wildebeests do? They herd together. They herd together for protection, and the one who is in the middle of the herd is the one who's the most protected. Those in the center of the herd— it's only those that are on the outlying part of the herd that are in danger. Okay, well, that means then that we as humans develop Through our DNA and through our long history of evolution, we have developed that same herding instinct of going along to get along. Just like the wolves will sleep in a nest in the den, and just like fish will school, is for protection. And when we're little kids, we learn that. We learn to do what we're told to do so that we can get along. When we operate like that, the Buddha calls that being reborn in the woeful state of an animal.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. As opposed to the classical belief in rebirth has to do with the Brahman belief of reincarnation. Which is way off into the distant future or way back in the distant past. And the real teachings of the Buddha have to do with being here now in this present moment, not living in the past of 5 or 10 years ago. So there is very little reason for anyone to muse or reminisce or to worry or to fret or to even have dreams about past lives, because they're so deep in the past they don't mean anything. That over time, let us say that any action, any karma is like an energy, and that we can compare it to light energy. That the further light travels, the more dispersed it gets. If we were in the vicinity of the Sun, sort of like if we were around the area of Mercury, there would be so much light intensity coming off the Sun that it would burn everything to a crisp. But the further away that we move from the Sun, the fewer rays touch us, because all the rays of the Sun are going out in all three-dimensional directions., and therefore getting weaker and weaker as they go out in time. You can see that, right? Okay, that's just quite natural. Uh, but in fact, they've, uh, done one experiment that there are certain frogs who live in certain caves that can detect just one photon of light, which is so little light that humans couldn't see it, would be completely black. But Prajna can get a little bit of information from one photon of light. So what we're getting at is, is that Kamma that happened hundreds of years ago gets weaker over time as it spreads out, just like light beams do. And therefore, the older the action, the less effect it has. A particular action that happened yesterday to you, if that same action happened to you 15 years ago, is way deep in the past now. Doesn't mean hardly anything. You may not even remember it. But things stay fresh in the mind because of the time. The reason that I'm saying this is because people have the idea of rebirth and reincarnation in the sense that a person's lifestyle, or the way they live, is now determined by what happened way deep dark in the past, a long time

**Speaker B:** ago.

**Speaker A:** In fact, one of the interesting things, back in the 1970s, when the Westerners were getting into this stuff, all the women that I knew, not all of them, let us say this group of people who were doing this stuff, and they found out about each other, But these 4 women all had the past life experience of having been Cleopatra. I knew 4 present-day reincarnations of Cleopatra. Now, is that possible or what? No. Okay, so this is what most reincarnation and rebirth is— is it's a fantasy world or a fantasy trip that people have, and that it has to do with the fact of actually the action now is the boss for them, or that what happened, what's happening now is being affected by the past that I don't have any control over. The reality is, is that that's true, except that the whole teachings of the Buddha has to do with, let's come out of that Kamma cycle and start making some present-day choices. That we do not have to operate according to our built-in programming or the instincts, that we can in fact see that the instincts is much more of our karmic history or our karmic past than some action that some human being 3,000 years ago did, that somehow the Kamma machine has decided that guy and you are the same person, therefore whatever the Kamma machine was going to dump on that guy now gets dumped on you. This is the idea that people have about it because they really don't understand that this is the rebirth is the rebirth of what happens in our mind when we move out of wisdom into instinctual behavior. That's the real birth, that's the real rebirth, and is almost always reborn into a woeful state of being. And that these woeful states of being have analogies to them. But the real actual vocal state is the vocal state of anger, frustration, anxiety, just being hot. And this is the label that's given as hell, because hell is the description of a person who is hot and upset and trying to get out of a situation but feels trapped in it. And so this is hell, and we all go through hell, but we always make our own hell. We manufacture our own hell with our feelings. Another of the woful states, uh, the one that I've also mentioned, the third one, is what is called the Hungry Ghost or the Preta. And what this is based on is, uh, that The ghost is pictured as a big balloon-like or big pot-like object that has a very, very small mouth, a very small opening. So it's got— it's a huge container with a very, very small opening. And what that means is that the pot is capable of holding a whole lot of stuff, but it can't because the mouth is too small, and so the stuff can't get in. And so the ghost is constantly in a state of hunger. This is basically the human's mental state of wanting something that we can't have. The hole for that to get in is too small, and therefore I cannot suck that Mercedes through a soda straw. This is what we mean then by the hungry ghost and that we're not talking about some sort of spook that's running around, an apparition that lives in an old castle or something, maybe in the bounds of a prison or a slave house. This is what we have, is the Western idea of ghost. But there was in fact a television show on the History Channel that ran for years that was basically Ghostbusters. Mm-hmm. From temple to, uh, old house to graveyard to caves to old castles, over and over and over again. And in their movies that they were making, new documentaries, they play spooky music and set up highly class, uh, sophisticated electronic gear. And at the end of every one of them, they never caught a ghost, but they were hot on the trail of one. Mm-hmm. Guess what? They never caught one. They never found a ghost. Nope, nope, they never did. So the question then is, is with all that ghost hunting all over the world, um, if they can't catch a ghost, then it's actually maybe not possible to catch one. And perhaps maybe the reason for that is, is that not only are ghosts hard to catch, they're hard to exist. Yep.

**Speaker B:** Or you're trying to catch something that, if it does, you're trying to catch something in a totally different plane that has a different set of rules, if it does, right? It kind of reminds me of, um, because I've always I get asked that a lot about as a Buddhist, you know, the whole concept of reincarnation. Or I get asked that a lot, to which I reply, well, Buddhist, that's a Hindu concept. Buddhists generally don't, you know, accept that reincarnation, that has to do with the soul. It's more of a concept of rebirth. And even that's going to depend on, there's different interpretations of that. But I've always, my favorite answer to that is the old story of the Zen master who was asked, you know, well, what happens when you die? And he said, I don't know. And the guy replied, well, you're a Zen master. And he goes, yeah, but I'm not a dead one. So that's what I always— when people ask me, it's like, you know, I don't know. What happens happens. I'm not focused on that. I'm focused on what's here in front of me.

**Speaker A:** That's exactly right. One thing on the side, can you turn your camera off and then back on? Your screen is frozen, and I didn't know whether you were still online or not until you talked.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, let me see.

**Speaker A:** Camera off and on, it may bring your video back. How about that? There you go, now you're back again. Okay. All right, so we actually, just for completion's sake, we talked about 3 of the woeful states, and I'll mention the 4th woeful state. And that 4th woeful state is called the state of the Asura. And basically what these are is they're like the Titans. You know about Greek mythology, the Titans are the warriors, heavenly warriors. But the Titans are all dressed up for battle, but they don't go to war, they don't go to battle. Possibly the only reason that they could go to battle would be the battle against the higher gods, because the warrior gods are very, very low class, and if they go against the higher gods, they'll probably moves. So basically what we're talking about here is that the state of Asura is the state of all dressed up and no place to go. It's the state that we could call stage fright, where the little kid dressed up in a toy tree walks out on the stage and he's got one line in his— in the play for the kids, and he forgets his line. Okay, this is it. Stage fright is an example of the asura state.

**Speaker B:** That's happened to me too, by the way.

**Speaker A:** Well, it probably happened in really, really big ways, but in small ways it happens quite often. We get lost in a conversation, we don't know what to answer to somebody, we get stuck. Okay, basically what we can say is, is that even though this is a micro example We get frozen in fear. All right, well, if we look at that, then these four woeful states that the Buddha is talking about is the range of emotions that we have when we're in negative emotional states. The woeful states of mind are anger, frustration, guilt, sadness, Afraid to move, don't know what to do, confusion. All of these are feelings that we wind up in when we're, let us say, dealing with our feelings unwisely. If I see something I like, then I want it. If I want it, then I become the hungry ghost, the Piti, because I want something that I can't have. This happens quite commonly with meditators. When people are in meditation, they want things. Why do people meditate? I actually generally ask that of students. Why do you meditate? Why do you want to meditate? Generally, they do it because they want something out of it, rather than the real reason that the Buddha would give, is that this is a marvelous state. We meditate because we like it. We meditate because we can do it. Not that we meditate because we want something out of it in the

**Speaker B:** future. It's interesting you bring that up. The guy that I do dharma on Sunday mornings, the monk, he was actually trained in Thailand. He's American, but he was trained in a Mahasi tradition in Thailand. And every once in a while, before COVID he'd have all these students or these people that would come for the first time, and they were looking for, I guess, the same thing, the magic, and they were expecting they were going to sit down and meditate, and they were going to see past lives and all this stuff before their eyes. And he would always disappoint them. He would say, well, the purpose of meditation, a lot of people will tell you that it's to relax or it's to do this. And he said, no, he would always tell them the purpose of meditation, at least the way I was taught and the way I teach it, is to observe and to, you know, go inside and see things as they are. If you're— if you're— we got an itch, you just know, hey, I got an itch. It's nothing spectacular about it. And when I tell— and he— it was usually amazing because when he did that, every week he'd see a new face. They wouldn't come back anymore because they didn't— that's what they wanted to hear. And he was perfectly fine with that because he was like you know, well, this is my job. They may not want to hear it, but I can't fluff it up. I have to tell it the way it is. And it was funny, whenever that happened, it kind of got me a good

**Speaker A:** little laugh out of it. Well, since you said it, this possibly is a good idea, or a good time then, to talk about it. What you just said that the Mahasi Method is, is in fact the Western understanding of the Mahasi Method, but it is not actually what Mahasi taught, at least not in the literature of Mahasi that I've read, which dates back to about 1950.

**Speaker B:** You're talking about the Manual of Insight?

**Speaker A:** No, I'm— I don't remember the name of it. It's in, uh, there's some big book that they have, and this article that I'm talking about I think is in the appendix to the back of that somewhat large book. But the point that I'm making here is that most of the understanding from the West through the Mahasi Method makes a critical mistake. It's not that they make a mistake, it's that they fail to emphasize a critically important point that is well known in the Mahasi method from Burma. But by the time it makes it to the West, it misses this critical point. Okay, now the critical point that we're talking about in the Mahasi— the Mahasi himself, Mahasi Sayadaw, says that whatever the object of meditation is You have to jump on it. You have to seize it. Actually, the translation is the word to fall upon, the way that thieves fall upon a victim on the road. They jump on it. Okay, this is not taught in the Mahasi Method. They talk just merely observe. An observer is a bird watcher, is not going to catch that bird. He's just going to watch

**Speaker B:** it.

**Speaker A:** That's a good analogy. You've got to trap that bird. You've got to catch it. And this is the main distinction then between what you would call the Burmese or the Thai tradition. But most of the Thai tradition that gets out is either highly influenced by Burma, which is in the northeast part of Thailand, But there is a whole different group that is much more noble in Thailand. I don't want to go into Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's history right now. We could do that at another time, but rather to talk about that the Anapanasati Sutta is the main sutta that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa works with, to where the Mahayana works with mostly the Satipatthana Sutta, number 10. Okay. With the Anapanasati Sutta, it actually fills in some of the blanks that are potentially missing, or let us say easy to slip over or to pass by. It's written right there in the book. And yet people run right by it. The example of what we're talking about here is the hindrances that are talked about in the Mahasi Method, especially in the Dhamma Nibbana, as what is there in the mind. But in the Satipatthana Sutta, it says when these hindrances are there, they are to be removed. Just like you can't just watch that fish, you got to catch it if you're going to have dinner. Yeah. Okay, this is also what we mean by having some skin in the game. It would be the difference between watching somebody else play a video game versus you playing the game yourself. Yep. Why? Because if you're just watching somebody else, you're just the observer. He's probably going to be making some moves that you didn't notice. The hand on the mouse is quicker than the eye, especially if the eye is watching the screen and not the mouse, and so he doesn't know what's going on. So, uh, here's, here's the point of, of this then, is that mere observation, or what the noting practice is of Mahasi, does not do the work that needs to be done. Because we don't have any skin in the game. It's just merely observational. And when that happens, the students really are not following the Four Noble Truths of the Eightfold Noble Path correctly. They wind up doing it like this. And when the entire teaching to the Buddha is known as Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, except in the Mahasi method, it's the note the dukkha, there's the dukkha, see the dukkha, dukkha, dukkha, go deep into dukkha, deep dive into dukkha, and someday you'll have some Dukkha and Nirodha, but for right now all you've got is Dukkha. Watch closely now. That's the Mahayana method. And that people get quite expert at noting the Dukkha, and they wind up in states like fearfulness, misery, disgust, a strong desire for escape. And that's because they've only been developing some of the skills that they need, and they're not developing the real skill that they need, which right view. And the right view is to investigate, to see what's wholesome and not wholesome, and then take the Eightfold Noble Path, right effort to remove that hindrance from the mind. This is the basic teachings of the Buddha beyond all else, is the combination of these three adds a fourth ingredient in time. The first three is Sati, to wake up. Number 2 is to investigate. You probably heard the example, to wake up and smell the coffee. Heard that, right? Okay, what does that actually mean? It means to wake up and pay attention to what's going on around here. Okay, but even if you smell the coffee, what does that imply you do? Drink the coffee. That's an action. That's not just smelling the coffee. So, uh, the Mahasi method is to wake up and smell the coffee, and so what? Yeah, the Anapanasati method is, is to, uh, to wake up and just smell the coffee and then do something about it. Get out of bed.

**Speaker B:** Well, you know, it's interesting what you were mentioning about the Mahasi

**Speaker A:** method.

**Speaker B:** My biggest, one of my biggest problems when I was doing it was I was taught at the very beginning you want to give every, you want to start with the, of course, the rising and falling of the abdomen. That's your main object of concentration.

**Speaker A:** Even that is a mistranslation. It's not the abdomen.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, what I'm saying is what I was, what I was taught was to do that And then when you first start out, you make a soft verbal in your mind, a label. And eventually you get past the label, then you just note it or notice it. And then you eventually get past that. And my biggest problem I had with it is I struggle with adult ADHD. And I was sticking with that labeling for so long verbally because it gave my mind something to do. When my mind had nothing to really do and just notice, It just wandered everywhere. But when I had a rising, a falling, itching, a hearing, a thinking to keep saying in my mind over and over, it kind of, you know, made it easier until people— I would have people tell me, well, you're supposed to get past that. And I just never

**Speaker A:** did.

**Speaker B:** But that's the way I was originally. Someone told me to do the whole rising of the abdomen.

**Speaker A:** Okay, let's start with the word abdomen. Do you know enough about the physiology of the human body to know where your lungs are? For an example, point to your lungs right now. Point to left and then the right lung.

**Speaker B:** Right here and right here.

**Speaker A:** How about up here?

**Speaker B:** The heart? Well, Actually, no, I think there are

**Speaker A:** because the heart— yeah, but right, but the heart has a smaller lung on the left side, but the heart is actually encased almost in the lung. Okay, so there is a lung up here and the heart is there, but the lung is all around it. Same thing except on the right we don't have the heart cavity, and so the right lung is actually larger than the left lung. Foremost human anatomy. Where is the abdomen now?

**Speaker B:** The abdomen, traditional, I was told it was right here, like around the navel, right?

**Speaker A:** Okay. Now that, in fact, possibly the first thing that I ever heard about meditation back in the way back in the 1960s, I was a child, and they called it navel gazing. Which was kind of a Christianized joke of the mistranslation of the word abdomen. The rising and falling is not of the abdomen unless it's the diaphragm muscle that's moving, and the diaphragmatic muscles are above the abdomen. The abdomen is only going to move if, uh, in certain situations. To where the breathing will arise in the chest. I mean, you can just actually put your hands on your chest, and when you're breathing, you can feel the movement. Yep. Okay. And that when we're doing a proper observation of the body, it's not the arising and the falling of the abdomen, it's the arising and the falling of the breathing. That's what's to be observed, is the right— but only in the sense— you've heard the expression rising, falling, touching, sitting. Yep. The rising, falling, touching, sitting is in fact the first 4 stages of Anapanasati by the numbers. And that the Gawanka method actually puts a lot into that touching and sitting, in the sense that they talk about body scanning. Okay, but the whole point of it is, is to get in touch with the body, to wake it up, to wake it up, become much more alive and alert, because it's part of our central awareness. See, when we're kids, little children are very, very sensitive to body touch. Every little thing is a boo-boo, everything hurts. Adults. A child will fall down and cry for— it depends upon the adults around it, but you know, they just cry and cry because it hurts so much. Yeah, we eventually as humans, we get intellectual. We start looking at ABCs and 1-2-3s, and we don't pay much attention to the body anymore. And after a while, we forget kind of all about it. That's especially true if we are city dwellers rather than living as country folk. Country folk are much more in touch with the body, but they're not so much smart up here, to where the city-fied guys, they get all smart up here and they forget about the body. And what a good meditator is going to do is integrate the two of them so that he's got high capabilities, intellectual, but he's also fully in touch with his body. The rising, falling, touching, and now the sitting part is actually proprioceptive. That one thing that you can understand is, is that when you're laying down, you know you're laying down, and you don't have to look at the body in a mirror or take a photo of it to see what posture you're in, that you know that. How do you know your postures right down to where your fingers are? You even know where your toes are. You even know which toes are touching the floor or the bottom of the shoes or whatever like this that we're talking about. This is what we call not touch, but proprioceptive. And it's the knowledge of the body. Dancers get very, very good at knowledge of body positions and postures. Is my kick high enough? Is my arch graceful enough? You know, this is the kind of thing it's so— dancers pay, but also sports. Sports people pay a lot of attention to the body. Yeah, they do. If you're going to jump into the air to catch that ball, they're going to have to have a whole lot of muscle coordination going on to be able to catch that ball while they're in the air at just the right height. So there's a lot of body coordination. This is what we mean by it, is really getting in touch with and knowing the body, but literally getting in touch with it in the sense of putting skin in the game. This is why we have the Anapanasati as a conscious kind of breathing, is getting in touch with the body, knowing the body, knowing the breath. And not only that, but if you can control the mind, then you can control the breathing. And by being able to breathe and control the breathing, you're also controlling the mind. This is why the Buddha recommends a long, deep breath in the Anapanasati Sutta. But he also says very carefully that Anapanasati practice is the practice of the Eightfold Noble Path for the fulfillment of the Satipatthana. But then we practice the Satipatthana for the fulfillment of the Sambhojana. But the Sambhojana, or the Seven Factors of Enlightenment, are exactly the Eightfold Noble Path after the skills are developed. So in the beginning, for the beginner, the Eightfold Noble Path is the skill of Sati that's to be developed, the skill of right effort to be developed, the skill of right view, which is the main one. Right view comes first. But we can't apply right view until we remember to apply right view. So Sati and right view, and then taking the right effort to make the change from the unwholesome to the wholesome. So right view is actually making the discernment: is what I'm doing right now useful, valuable, wholesome, and beneficial? Or is it blasé? Is it a junk thought? Or is it downright harmful? And so we could have then these three levels. You would have wrong view, ordinary right view, which is where most people live, which is junk thoughts, blasé, whatever's going on, that's what I'm thinking about, as opposed to noble, high-class thoughts of, wow, this is wonderful, isn't this nice, everything's all right, everything is fine. So we need now then to take two changes that actually require the mind to go out and catch that bird rather than just looking at it. Or to go out and catch that fish, rather than just hoping. So how we're going to do that is by the breathing of making it easy and long on the in-breath. Means that we have to remember. If we don't remember, then the breathing will go back to being shallow. So the long deep breath doesn't have to be a major change in the way that we're breathing. But it has to be a conscious change that we actually do. So for the long in-breath, you remember that this is a long in-breath, and it's actually better to talk to yourself about this long, deep in-breath. And then on the out-breath, we also remember that this is a long, deep out-breath, that we're not going to forget about it or let the mind wander away. And so that means Sati on the in-breath and Sati on the out-breath. And that begins to develop the skill of Sati. What is Sati? To remember to do something. Okay, so that's basically the wake up. Wake up and smell the coffee. Sati, wake up, smell the coffee is the right view of taking the senses. Okay, I smell the coffee with the sense of smell. It's not that I'm dreaming about coffee. I'm laying in bed asleep dreaming about coffee. I actually smell the coffee. It's real. And now I can take the effort to go get that coffee. Yeah. All right. So those are the three first things of the Eightfold Noble Path is to wake up, to smell the coffee, and then get out of bed to go get it. In our practice is to remember that we're going to watch the breath, to take a deep breath and to watch the breath, but also the thoughts that we have have to be guarded, monitored, and changed. This is what Bhikkhu Buddhadasa means about that the Kamma is actually more of a re-Kamma, that we actually have the English language word for reaction. Now, what we mean by reaction or react is that we're doing the same actions over and over again. We react when a stimulus happens. We have a reaction to it if it's automatic. Well, we also can respond to it, but the response has to be through wisdom. Okay, so the difference is, is this real or is it imaginary? And if it's in the mind, it's imaginary. And we're going to live in a real world, which means we wake up out of the sixth sense of the mind and come into developing the other five senses that we haven't been paying much attention to. That in fact, even when we're seeing, we don't see, we just see a little bit, and then we think. We have see, think, feel. See, think, feel. See, think, feel. And we never get to the point of just seeing and seeing and seeing, so that the seen is merely the seen and the heard is merely the heard. Requires a great deal of mental strength to stop that perceptional feeling process. But normally it goes, I see it, I think about it, I feel about it, Then I either like it or don't like it, and then I wind up in one of those woeful states of clinging because I don't like it or I like it. And this is the suffering. This is the Dukkha, is getting reborn into these woeful states. There's four woeful states and there's four modes of clinging, and they are corresponding. Okay. The corresponding ones have to do with— well, let's get into that a little bit later. Let's stay back on the basics, that the mind winds up in woeful states unless we can catch it. And so the faster we are, the quicker we can catch these things and then make modification to them. It's not just a matter of observing the bird or noticing. It's a matter of we've got to catch it. We've got to make some changes. And this is what we mean then about the unwholesome thoughts, is we have to label an unwholesome thought as an unwholesome thought, but then we have to change that thought from an unwholesome thought to a wholesome thought. In Sutta number 117, which is an exposition of the Eightfold Noble Path, it talks about right effort in the sense of what is one's right effort. And there's two places where it's mentioned. One is that one's right effort is to see wrong view as wrong view and to change it into right view. And then later it says one's right effort is to see wrong attitude as wrong attitude and to change it to right attitude. This is actually the work that it takes. One's right effort means that we have to actually make a change. We have to actually seize it. It's not like just watching somebody else play a video game. We've got to get in there and get in that game. Okay, you've got to actually go, uh, catch that thing. So there is also in Sutta number 19— the name of the sutta, by the way, is Two Kinds of Thoughts— and in this the Buddha talks about what is wholesome thought and what is unwholesome thought. But it's an ambiguous kind of thing because the students have to begin to figure this out for themselves. One of the things sure that we can think of is that thoughts of wanting things that we don't have, or thoughts of trying to put up with something that we don't want to put up with, or worse still, thoughts of cruelty. And an agitated mind is in fact a kind of cruel— if you're sitting there reminiscing and worried over something and keep hitting it and keep hitting it, in a way you're kind of cruel to yourself. It's like a mother who's angry at a child and keeps yelling and keeps yelling and keeps yelling at the child, which is one time was enough. The kid heard the first time, but Mom keeps yelling and keeps screaming because she's angry. Okay, so this is the way that we, uh, operate within our own minds, is that we are actually cruel to ourselves sometimes. We keep yelling at ourselves for doing something, and we're not doing it anymore, but we're thinking about it, that in fact we can feel guilty and remorseful of a thought about something that happened 5 years ago, and we can feel bad about it again. All we have to do is think about it, and then we start to feel bad. This is the reactions that we have that we're talking about. Rather than the response. A real response would think about, oh well, that happened 5 years ago, that wasn't me. Who I am now is who I am now, and I renounce that kind of behavior. But 5 years ago I did that kind of behavior, because that is a change. I have changed. I am not that person anymore. But that is wholesome. Most people don't. They keep thinking that, oh, 5 years ago I did that, therefore I'm the one who did that. Me now is the same one who did that 5 years ago, and therefore because I think about what happened 5 years ago, I gotta punish me that did it right now again, right? But wisdom would say, but I, I've changed, I don't do that kind of stuff, therefore who did that is not me. And so I don't have to feel bad about what happened something 5 years ago that happened to someone else. So here's the point then. This Sutta number 19 is to come out of our cruelty, and that there's analogy there. And the analogy is, is that a A cowherd has to take his few cows, because this is ancient India, you know, we're not drovers with 15,000 cows going from Texas to Kansas, but rather just 4 or 5 cows. And the cowherd has a stick that he carries because he's got to go down a pathway. And on this path, there are food stalls, kids, a kind of village and whatnot like that. And if these cows misbehave, start stealing the food, trample on the kids, uh, then the cowherd is going to have trouble. So he has to guard these cows, and if that cow goes off to get something, he's going to whack that cow with that stick. And as he passes through, he's very mindful to make sure that the cows are not going to do any damage. They're not going to run into any furniture. They're not going to break down a stall. They're not going to food, they're not going to harm anyone, they're going to get on that path and stay on that path until he gets through the village. Once he gets out to the pasture with the cows, he can then relax because now the cows are not in danger. And the analogy is, is that getting the cows through the village and whacking them is keeping the thoughts wholesome. One wholesome thought after another. We don't let the mind wander away. By the way, can you move? You're only cut off at your nose. I can only see your mouth. That's okay. But if you can arrange— Now what

**Speaker B:** it is, is just I've been working all week and I've been up since 3 o'clock this morning. So once it gets near the end, I just start to just like slumber off and then I have to keep trying to raise myself up.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so the analogy then is the analogy of let's have one wholesome thought after another wholesome thought after another wholesome thought with this cow herder. Because when the cows are in the pasture and that they're safe, now he can relax. He doesn't have to stand there with his stick whacking the cows. Then in fact, he can go sit down under a tree and just keep an eye on them. Because what the cows are doing now are all wholesome. This is what the Buddha would— and now I have the analogy that getting the cows out to the pasture so that they can be wholesome and not harming anything at all is very much like the first Jhana, which means that now we can finally relax because the mind is completely wholesome. But this takes skin in the game. This takes waking up and smelling that coffee and finding out that that coffee you don't want to drink. And so this is somewhat different than the Mahasi method, but in fact it really is the Mahasi method with just a small ingredient missing. And that small ingredient that's missing in the Anapanasati Sutta is actually step 10, that's called gladdening the mind or brightening the mind. And you can see from these other sutras that I've talked about, that means that we have to actually change the content of the mind to where, with the Western method of Mahasi, we only note it without making that change. Okay, so the Mahasi method is a bird watcher, and the Anapanasati has fowl for lunch. So that's the difference, is that the bird watcher is only going to be able to react to what the bird is doing. So when the bird goes over there, he reacts and he moves. All he can do is react, but he can't catch the bird. Yeah, this is the major difference then between why the Mahasi Method is so difficult and so slow a progress to where the Buddha's practice. In fact, in one of the suttas, number 111, the Buddha talks about that it only took Sariputta 2 weeks, only a fortnight. But he started that fortnight with this statement: quite secluded from sensual desire, quite secluded from unwholesome states. This is how we start. This is not how we wind up. This is how we start, is start with a mind free from hindrances. The Mahayana method starts with mind still in

**Speaker B:** hindrance.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And we note

**Speaker B:** them.

**Speaker A:** Oh, and so it's possible for someone to do the Mahasi Method for 5, 10, 15, 20, maybe 50 years and to never get to the point of saying, I'm doing something wrong. And basically what that means is, is that you have to make the change from Dukkha to Dukkha, Nirodha. We have to see that Dukkha in the mind. That cow herd has to whack that cow to keep it from grabbing that carrot. Okay, so we have to whack the mind in a way to change the unwholesome thought to make it a wholesome thought. And an easy way to do that is by tying the breath and the thoughts together by having good wholesome thoughts about the breathing as well. Like, wow, as I breathe in, I breathe in joy, and as I breathe out, I relax. This would be wholesome thoughts. Wow, this is a good one. Oh, I feel so good. So this is the direction that we're going in, is not just that we're taking control of the breathing, but we're actually taking control of everything. In order to control the breathing, you got to control the mind. But to properly control the mind means that you're going to only have the content of the mind that you want to have as the mind, not just whatever pops up. Because we have been, in fact, non-discriminatory our whole life. We tell kids to think, but we don't tell them what to think. We tell them how to behave, but we don't tell them about thinking. But the mind is the forerunner for everything. And so because we don't teach our kids how to think, we— they wind up just thinking whatever junk thoughts that there are, and we wind up living a junk life. An ordinary life based upon ordinary thinking, when in fact we could have a marvelous life just by merely having marvelous thinking. An example— in fact, the way that I like to express it is, is that we have spent our whole lives talking ourselves into feeling bad. Now it's time to talk ourselves into feeling good. That's what we mean by the Anapanasati, or the gladdening of the mind, which is also meaning to put wholesome thoughts in the mind. So now that we have wholesome thoughts in the mind and we have wholesome breathing that we're watching, something new happens, and that is, is that the feelings come into play. If we have feelings of fear But we have thoughts of everything is all right, no alligators here, no problems. And we look at the situation wisely, we can see that in fact in this particular moment there's no reason to be fearful, that I can come out of my fear and come to a state to where I feel secure and comfortable. Why is it? I mean, the house that you're living in there looks like very, very safe and comfortable place. Why is it that you spend so many moments in that house with fear and anxiety? Because you're living safe. The answer is, is because you remember that you felt fearful in the past, and so by having thoughts of the past, you'll bring up the fears of the past. If you don't have any thoughts of the past, then there's nothing to be afraid of right now. There's no fearful things in this present moment, and all the fearful things in the past are still in the past now. They don't exist anymore. And yet people carry around their fears based upon their old memories, which are unwholesome. To think about the past and then to feel bad about the past is an unwholesome, unworthy thing for a human to do. Not noble at all. The noble thing is to see how beautiful things are right now, recognize how beautiful they are, see it directly with wisdom that things are nice right now, and then enjoy it. But no, we keep telling ourselves, well, things were screwed up in the past, they will be screwed up in the future, so why don't I go ahead and complete the operation and feel like things are screwed up now? Instead of recognizing, yeah, things were screwed up in the past and more things are going to get screwed up in the future, but right now everything's great.

**Speaker B:** Mhm.

**Speaker A:** And if we can keep that mentality going one breath at a time— everything right now is okay, everything is fine— then we can literally talk ourselves into satisfaction. We can talk ourselves into feeling comfortable because we actually do feel comfortable. We're sitting here relaxing the body, taking deep breaths, and everything is okay. Mhm. But the noting method is just noting the crap. We're not just noting the crap, we're taking the trash out. Yes. And so it has a lot to do with attitude. And as we begin to change our attitude, the job becomes easier. That one's right effort in the beginning is actually effort We have to put some effort in, we have to put some skin in the game. But as we get successful, we begin to build upon that success. And that success is now the next ingredient. The fourth item on the Eightfold Noble Path is Samma Sanghappa, one's right attitude. That we're beginning to actually add the enthusiasm. I could do this. I can create my mind, I can get myself into a really good state. I've watched me do it. I've been doing it before. I can do it again. This is the way that we begin to approach it. So we gain a new attitude, and that attitude is the attitude of a winner, as opposed to the attitude that we were born and raised with, which is the attitude of a victim, the attitude of One down, the attitude of a child has to put up with the fact that the adults are bigger and better than I am. And we start off in that childlike position and we maintain it and we never grow up out of being a victim. But with this Samma Sanghappa as a part of the Eightfold Noble Path, we're intentionally growing up, we're intentionally feeling successful. We're intentionally developing the attitude of a lion and no longer have the attitude of a victim. So the victim's attitude is, wow, meditation is so hard. The mind is a monkey mind. It just jumps all around and it's really hard to control. But that's just the wrong attitude. The right attitude is, hey man, come on back, we can do this. Yeah, the mind wandered away. Never mind, you forget that. Let's come back and start again. We can do this. So this is how the Four Noble Truths work with that Eightfold Noble Path through the breathing with Anapanasati, gladdening the mind. And we eventually add this fourth ingredient of the right attitude, and that attitude is the winner's attitude. And so then the Buddha in another sutta mentions that when the student comes to the point that they can say with that confidence that no matter how obstructed the mind gets, no matter what way it gets obstructed, I can clean that out and come back to this present moment and be here now and see what's going on in reality. This is the first teaching of the Buddha that is noble, supermundane, and a factor of the path, and not held by ordinary people. Ordinary people still are victims to their own minds, they're victims to the circumstances. An example of that is, is that you're tuning along, or that somebody's tuning along, and they look in the rearview mirror and they see the red lights and they hear the siren

**Speaker B:** going Mhm.

**Speaker A:** How do you feel at that moment when you see the cop? Okay, but how you're feeling and what you're thinking is a mental hindrance. The cop hasn't even stopped you yet, you're still driving. Yep. And so in this particular moment, everything's still okay, but we freak out, not because of what the cop has done, but because of what we think might go wrong, what we think might happen. Oh no, this is terrible. Okay, and so that means that now the mind is hindered. But if you have Anapanasati and the cop stops you, you can take a deep breath, roll down your window, and be very happy to see that cop. Wow, I'm so happy to see you, officer. I'm glad to see you guys out on duty here.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, he might try to arrest you for being on

**Speaker A:** drugs. Well, when people are afraid of the police, they act with fear, they create an atmosphere of fear, and then the cop picks up on that fear as natural, and he's going to respond to the situation as if it's a dangerous situation and somebody's likely to get killed. All because, for instance, George Floyd could not control his feelings. He was freaked out. If he'd have said, 'Hi, officer, glad to see you,' but oh no, he says, 'Oh, don't hurt me, don't hurt me, don't hurt me,' and he freaks out and he gets killed because of his own fear. We actually create that which, uh, is the danger. The danger we create in the mind, and then we attract that danger. An example of that is, who do the dogs bark at? Bark at? They bark at the person who knows the dogs and are friendly and say, 'Hi dog, I see you.' Or is he going to be— the dog's going to respond viciously to the guy who stops and afraid and doesn't know how to— you know, like postman. For some reason, the post office only hires people who are afraid of dogs.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it was like I was told about, you know, many years ago, the dog's like chasing As soon as you run, they sense that fear, and that's when they will come. And when I lived in Colorado, they would tell hikers that when you're out hiking, you come upon a cougar, don't just turn around and run. Don't turn your back on it. In fact, some of them, they have their bikes, they tell them to raise the bike over their head to look bigger and charge after it. And I've heard stories where they did that and cougar ran off. But as soon as you act afraid and take run, they pick up on that fear and they chase you down.

**Speaker A:** Guess what? Not just cougars and dogs and cops, but that happens in all situations. It happens if a kid is yelled at by mom and the kid stands up and says, you're right, Mom, I really agree with you. I'm not going to do that anymore. That'll stop her in her tracks. But if that kid goes like this, she's just going to attack that kid. It's very natural. It's part of the instincts. Knowing that you behave that way, we can be on guard for it, so that no matter what happens, we can be fearless. No matter how obstructed the mind gets with dangers or whatnot like that, we can clean that out and come back and look at the situation. An example of that is the biker who is being confronted by the cougar. He knows that if he runs away from that cougar, the cougar's going to chase him. But if he confronts the cougar, because the cougar is not going to challenge him, not with that great big bicycle up there. Yep, right. So this is wisdom. Wisdom is, is that we've got to take charge. We, we're the champion here. We're the lion. We can handle anything. You can handle that cop. That cop would He's just a child, so I treat him like a happy little boy, and that cop will be a happy little boy. He won't give me a ticket, or if he does, I can handle that too. Yep. So these are examples of very, very heavy situations we get ourselves into, but it's not the situation that's dangerous, it's our mental response to it. So that means that we actually have to learn how to take control of the mind. I mean, it wouldn't have helped George Floyd very much if he would have seen that cop and says, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear. I'm noting fear. I've been to Mahasi. I know what fear is. I can hear fear, fear, fear, fear. There, you know, no, we actually have to do more than just monitor, to smell the coffee. We've got to actually get up and do something about it. So this little talk that we've had today is all about putting some skin in the game or not doing a passive meditation, but doing an active meditation and the action that we have to do is to clean out the mind and to put wholesome thoughts in. And so many students will say, well, yeah, but what's a wholesome thought? The answer to that is that's a skill that each one of us has to develop by checking things out. That in the beginning we would think that just ordinary junk thoughts are okay, but later we can recognize that no, those ordinary junk thoughts actually keep me a bit agitated, and if I didn't have them, I'd feel better. And so we begin to then discern more and more about, is this thought wholesome or not? And we begin to gain the skill of knowing what is wholesome. And then we start to intentionally have wholesome thoughts and intentionally catch unwholesome thoughts and throw them out so that we wind up with a mind that has one wholesome thought after another wholesome thought after another wholesome thought. And to now, when that happens, guess what? When we're doing the Mahasi Method, we only have wholesome things to be noted. We're not going to go around noting all the Dukkha and all the suffering and all the trash that we're not taking out. We've taken out the trash, and so now we have a vista that we can note. Got some clarity. We throw the trash out, and now we can see further. We can really do some noting now. And so the noting actually would start— the Mahasi Method would start after the mind is clean, free from hindrances. But in the West, the way that Mahasi Method is taught is instead of noting the hindrances and then throwing them out, they just Note it and note it and note it some more. And that's why the 16 stages of insight that comes out of the Visuddhimagga has that step 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 that has fear, misery, disgust, despair, and strong desire to get out of it. That's because the student has only been developing some of the skills that they need, the skill of observation. But not the skill of taking charge, not the skill of either right effort nor right attitude. And that was only lost in translation. That's a translation error. That's merely a translation error that didn't make it from Asian culture to Western culture. So now I'm introducing that to you, that this is the ingredient that in Western Mahasi has been missing, is this point about that you've got to take control of your own mind. You've got to throw those hindrances

**Speaker B:** out,

**Speaker A:** okay, and get the mind in good, perfect working order, which means it is working with good, wholesome input. Okay, okay. You've heard the expression garbage in, garbage out, right?

**Speaker B:** Oh yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, if you've got garbage in the mind, guess what's going to come out of your mouth?

**Speaker B:** Oh, it's like same thing, garbage.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. But if you've got good, proper, wholesome, high-quality, noble thoughts in the mind, what's going to come out of the mouth? The exact same thing. Exactly. And believe me, whether you're having wholesome thoughts and wholesome speech when you're being stopped by the cop is

**Speaker B:** important.

**Speaker A:** Definitely, definitely. It's better to have wholesome speech with the cop than to tell him, hey, you guys out here in blue, you're, you, you're just doing sting operations. Nobody out here on the road is doing anything wrong. You, you cops are just money grubbers. You're out here giving tickets to make people feel bad and make them out a lot of money for the city. Why don't the city raise their taxes instead of charging your motorists for— Do you have that kind of attitude with the cop? Guess what?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you're generally— it's not going to end too well.

**Speaker A:** It's not going to end well at all. You may be right. But it's not a good wholesome thing to do. Being right is not always wholesome. Mm-hmm. And yet in our society, being right seems to be the only criteria.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, or at least the one that people think about the most. They don't factor in anything else.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, if I'm right, then I won't get into trouble. You know, yes you can. You can take that right action, do some right damage with almost definitely, and get yourself into a right bit of trouble. So this is the whole quality then, is that we're looking more for wholesome, beneficial, rather than whether we're right or not. Okay, because being right is often unwholesome.

**Speaker B:** It

**Speaker A:** is. And so we have to make that distinction also. How do we tell what's a wholesome thought and what's not a wholesome thought? A lot of people make the mistake, well, it's right, therefore it must be wholesome. No, just because it's right doesn't make it wholesome. It has to do with how you do it. I mean, that can of paint may be a right good can of paint, but if you throw it against somebody's wall, it's not going to do you a whole lot of good. No, you got to be careful with the way that we apply that right good thing. So this is the practice of Anapanasati, is right Sati, to remember to take long, deep, easy breaths and to wake up, to take an investigation of what have we got in our mind, is it wholesome or not? And then number 3 is to take the effort to throw that stuff out that's unwholesome. And when we keep doing that, then the fourth ingredient is right attitude. Hey, I can do this. And we come out of that position of being a lion into the position of being— excuse me, out of the position of being a victim into the position of being noble, not in danger. And so it's not a matter of how deep we breathe, but rather that it is conscious deep breathing. And when I say deep, I'm not talking about deep like 100% in and then 100% out, because that's too much work. Lungs are different than that anyway. They go in a small range. Yes. And so just expanding that range just a little bit is all that's needed to make sure that we're getting a lot of air, a lot of healthy oxygen coming in, as well as throwing out the carbon dioxide. This is what happens when people are afraid, is in fact our breathing gets really shallow. This instinct is called the freeze that happens before the flight or the fright. Fight or flight. So we freeze and then make the choice of fight or flight. What we need to do is not go into that freeze stage, is by continuing to breathe well. Because basically, if we're afraid— let us say that the mail came in and I stuffed it in my pocket and went to work. Work. And now I'm sitting at work and I open that water bill and I go into a

**Speaker B:** panic.

**Speaker A:** All right, but it was just a piece of paper. There was no reason to have a panic because I see a water bill. It's just a piece of paper. Right now I'm okay. I might want to panic when I turn the water on and there's no water coming out of the faucet. That might be the time to panic, and I should have wisely taken care it before then. But people do panic when they open the mail. There's no reason to panic. So whenever you open your mail, before you start opening, you can do some Anapanasati with the thought that there's nothing in this mail that's going to upset me.

**Speaker B:** That's a good one.

**Speaker A:** There's nothing here that will upset me. Any mail that I read If I get upset, it's because I choose to do that and I did it unwisely. If I choose to feel wisely, I will feel good when I can. And I can handle any mail that comes in. It doesn't matter what it is. I can handle it. So that's the right attitude. That's Samma Sanghappa, the attitude: I can do anything. I can handle this moment. I don't have to worry about what's going to happen in the future because I'm ready for it right now. I can handle this moment, I can handle the next one. If I can handle that moment, I can handle the next one. One moment at a time, off into the

**Speaker B:** future.

**Speaker A:** And one of those moments is going to bring death, and I can handle that too. One of those moments is going to bring sickness, and I'm going to handle that too. Yep. And one of those moments is going to bring old age, And I can handle that too. Yep, that's the way to look at it, is, is that not this is Dukkha, Dukkha, Dukkha, and I'll be free from Dukkha sometime. It's that, oh no, there will be Dukkha coming in the future. Are you ready for it? Are you prepared? That's the right attitude. Yeah, I'm ready for it. I can handle this moment shiningly, I can handle that moment also. This is Samma Sanghappa, the right attitude. The right attitude is based upon success, the success of being able to gladden the mind and take a deep breath and relax. Because that's the right way to die, I would think. Why should you die uptight when you could die relaxed? It's a matter of attitude.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's why most people would want to, I would

**Speaker A:** think. So let's finish off now. Uh, this has been a very good segue talking about the Mahasi Method because, uh, it's a, it's a good, uh, point or analogy about what's the right way to practice. We're getting great benefit out of Okay, good. Do you have any questions?

**Speaker B:** Uh, no, you were actually, uh, you pretty much got, you know, everything you'd answered. And I'm still working on what you were talking about last week, and I have this, you know, as well. So, and that's what I've been doing whenever I got any kind of question. I just go back and then just watch it over, or I just— a lot of it I can remember at what point we were talking about it. I can go find it and I can still reference that if I need it.

**Speaker A:** That's excellent, I'm glad. Okay, Brady, well, we'll see you later then. All right, we'll see you next week. You keep practicing, keep doing it, and we'll go into it a little deeper. All right, thank you. Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a Sangha friend (Speaker B), explores core Buddhist concepts through a practical, down-to-earth lens. The conversation begins with a simple observation about a cat and evolves into a profound discussion on meditation, morality, and the nature of suffering.

Here is a structured summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: Active vs. Passive Practice**
The central argument is that true Buddhist practice requires **active engagement** ("skin in the game") rather than passive observation. Dhammarato contrasts two approaches:
*   **The "Mahasi Method" as commonly taught in the West:** He characterizes this as passive "noting" or "bird-watching"—observing mental phenomena (like suffering, hindrances) without actively changing them.
*   **The "Anapanasati Method" (and the true intent of the Buddha's path):** This is an **active practice** of "catching the bird." It involves:
    1.  **Sati (Mindfulness):** Waking up to the present moment (e.g., consciously taking a long, deep breath).
    2.  **Right View (Investigation):** Discerning whether a thought or state is wholesome or unwholesome.
    3.  **Right Effort:** Actively **removing** unwholesome states and **cultivating** wholesome ones. This is the critical, often missing, step of "taking out the trash" from the mind.
    4.  **Right Attitude (Samma Sankappa):** Developing a confident, "lion-like" attitude of "I can handle this," moving from a victim mentality to one of mastery.

### **Key Discussions and Analogies**

1.  **Morality (Sila) from Wisdom, Not Rules:**
    *   True morality isn't just following rules. It naturally arises from a purified mind free of greed, hatred, and delusion. When the mind is filled with wholesome thoughts, harmful actions (killing, stealing, lying) become impossible.

2.  **Instinct vs. Human Wisdom:**
    *   Using the example of pets chasing bugs or dogs killing a chicken, Dhammarato explains that animals act on **instinct** without moral choice.
    *   Humans have the capacity for **wisdom and memory**, which allows us to overcome instinctual, reactive patterns. Our task is to move from instinctual "reaction" to wise "response."

3.  **Rebirth and the "Woeful States" (Dukkha) Here and Now:**
    *   The talk de-mystifies rebirth, framing it not as a literal past-life phenomenon but as the **moment-to-moment rebirth of mental states**.
    *   The four "woeful states" are psychological realities we experience daily:
        *   **Hell Realm:** States of anger, burning frustration, and feeling trapped.
        *   **Hungry Ghost (Preta) Realm:** The torment of craving and wanting what you cannot have.
        *   **Animal Realm:** The state of operating on pure instinct, "going along to get along" without wisdom.
        *   **Asura (Titan/Demon) Realm:** The state of paranoia, competition, and "stage fright"—being ready for a fight that never comes or feeling frozen.

4.  **Kamma (Karma) as Habitual Reaction:**
    *   Kamma is likened to a fading light—actions from the distant past have less power over the present. The focus should be on **present-moment choices**.
    *   The cycle of suffering is maintained by our **habitual reactions** (e.g., feeling fear when seeing a police car based on past thoughts, not present danger). The path is about breaking this cycle.

5.  **Practical Meditation Instruction:**
    *   The object is the **breath**, not the "abdomen." The practice is **conscious breathing**—knowing you are taking a long, deep, easy breath in and out.
    *   The goal is to **gladden the mind** by actively filling it with wholesome, joyful thoughts related to the breath (e.g., "Breathing in, I feel joy. Breathing out, I relax").
    *   This creates a positive feedback loop: wholesome thoughts lead to calm, which makes it easier to maintain wholesome thoughts.

### **Conclusion: The Wholesome over the "Right"**
The talk concludes with a powerful, practical point: **Being "right" is not always wholesome.** In social interactions (like with a police officer), insisting on being right can create conflict and danger. Wisdom seeks what is **beneficial, peaceful, and skillful**, not merely what is factually correct. The ultimate aim is to build a mind so resilient and wholesome that it can meet any moment—even difficulty, sickness, or death—with calm and clarity.

**In essence:** The path is an active, moment-to-moment training in taking charge of your mind. By using the breath as an anchor, you learn to identify unwholesome states, eject them, and replace them with wholesome ones. This builds the wisdom and attitude that naturally lead to moral living and freedom from suffering, right here and now.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this rich and wide-ranging conversation, the talk uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain Buddhist concepts, meditation practices, and the nature of the mind. Here is a breakdown of the primary ones:

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies**

**1. The House Pet (Cat & Dog)**
*   **What it illustrates:** The difference between instinctual behavior and karmic responsibility, and the concept of a "fortunate rebirth."
*   **How it's used:** The speakers begin by discussing the cat, Shishi, and her behavior. This leads to the monk's point that pets have an easy life with little bad karma because they don't *intentionally* kill (it's instinct). Speaker A expands this to dogs chasing a rooster, arguing that animal behavior is purely instinctual, unlike human action, which involves intention and memory. This sets up the contrast between living by instinct (like an animal) and living by wisdom.

**2. The Cowherd and His Cows**
*   **What it illustrates:** The meditative work of cultivating wholesome thoughts and guarding the mind.
*   **How it's used:** This is a direct analogy from the suttas (likely referencing MN 19). The cowherd must vigilantly use his stick to keep his cows from straying into a village and causing damage. Once in the safe pasture, he can relax. Similarly, the meditator must actively "whack" unwholesome thoughts to keep the mind on the path. Once the mind is in a "wholesome pasture" (like the first jhana), one can relax in observation.

**3. Light Rays and Karma (Kamma)**
*   **What it illustrates:** The diminishing effect of past actions over time.
*   **How it's used:** Speaker A compares karmic energy to light from the sun. Close to the source (a recent action), it's intense and powerful. As light travels (as time passes), it disperses and weakens. Therefore, an action from yesterday has much more effect than one from 15 or hundreds of years ago. This metaphor argues against being overly fixated on distant past lives and emphasizes present-moment practice.

**4. The Hungry Ghost (Preta)**
*   **What it illustrates:** The mental state of insatiable craving and want.
*   **How it's used:** Described as a being with a huge belly but a tiny mouth, forever unable to satisfy its hunger. This is not a literal ghost but a metaphor for the human condition of "wanting something we can't have"—like trying to "suck a Mercedes through a soda straw." It represents one of the four "woeful states" of mind.

**5. The Asura / Titan**
*   **What it illustrates:** The state of being "all dressed up with nowhere to go," characterized by stage fright, frustration, and frozen potential.
*   **How it's used:** Compared to Greek Titans—warriors dressed for battle but with no one to fight (as they'd lose against higher gods). It's the anxiety of a child forgetting a line in a school play. This is another "woeful state" of paralyzing fear and agitation.

**6. Bird Watching vs. Catching the Bird**
*   **What it illustrates:** The crucial difference between passive observation and active engagement in meditation.
*   **How it's used:** This is the central critique of a common Western interpretation of the Mahasi "noting" method. Merely *noting* a thought (bird watching) is insufficient. One must actively "catch" or "seize" the unwholesome thought and remove it, replacing it with a wholesome one. True practice requires "skin in the game."

**7. Watching vs. Playing a Video Game**
*   **What it illustrates:** Reinforces the "skin in the game" metaphor for meditation.
*   **How it's used:** Observing someone else play (or observing your thoughts) is passive. You must be the player (actively engage with and change your mind) to make progress.

**8. The Herding Instinct (Wildebeests, Fish, Wolves)**
*   **What it illustrates:** The human tendency for conformity ("going along to get along") born from evolutionary instinct for protection.
*   **How it's used:** Wildebeests herd against lions, fish school, wolves den together, and dogs sleep near their "alpha" (their human) due to a nesting instinct. Humans have the same DNA-driven instinct to conform for safety. The Buddha calls operating purely from this place being "reborn in the woeful state of an animal."

**9. Smelling the Coffee**
*   **What it illustrates:** The stages of the Noble Eightfold Path applied to mindfulness.
*   **How it's used:**
    *   **Sati (Mindfulness):** Wake up.
    *   **Right View/Investigation:** Smell the coffee (become aware of what's actually present).
    *   **Right Effort:** Get up and drink the coffee (take action based on that awareness).
    The talk argues some methods stop at "smelling," while true practice requires the action of "drinking."

**10. Garbage In, Garbage Out**
*   **What it illustrates:** The direct link between the quality of thoughts (input) and the quality of speech, action, and experience (output).
*   **How it's used:** To emphasize why actively cultivating wholesome thoughts is essential. If you fill your mind with "garbage" (unwholesome, fearful thoughts), your life and reactions will reflect that.

### **Stories and Anecdotes**

*   **The Four Cleopatras:** A humorous anecdote from the 1970s about four women who all believed they were Cleopatra in a past life. This story is used to debunk the popular, literalistic view of reincarnation as a linear parade of famous past lives and to highlight its potential for fantasy.
*   **The Zen Master and Death:** Speaker B references a classic Zen story where a master, asked what happens after death, replies, "I don't know." When challenged ("But you're a Zen master!"), he says, "Yes, but I'm not a dead one." This underscores the Buddhist focus on the present moment over speculative metaphysics.
*   **George Floyd & The Traffic Stop:** Used as a powerful, real-world example of how fear and unwholesome mental states (panic, victimhood) can create a dangerous reality. Contrasted with the possibility of a wise, calm, and wholesome response that could de-escalate a situation.
*   **The Hiker and the Cougar:** A story supporting the "lion vs. victim" attitude. Running (acting from fear) triggers the cougar's chase instinct, while standing tall and appearing confident (wise, fearless response) can make it retreat. This applies to all of life's "threats," from wild animals to interpersonal conflicts.

### **Overall Narrative Purpose**
These metaphors and stories are woven together to argue for a specific approach to Dhamma practice:
1.  **Move beyond instinct and social conformity** (animal/herding metaphors).
2.  **Understand karma as present-moment intention** rather than cosmic fate (light metaphor).
3.  **Recognize the "woeful states"** (hell, hungry ghost, animal, asura) as **mental states we create** here and now.
4.  **Practice meditation actively**—not as a passive observer but as an engaged "cowherd" or "bird catcher" who purifies the mind.
5.  **Cultivate a "lion's" attitude of confidence and capability** (Samma Sankappa) through present-moment success, breaking the "victim" mentality.

The talk uses these vivid images to shift the understanding of rebirth from a distant, literal process to a moment-to-moment event of the mind being "reborn" into either wisdom or suffering.
