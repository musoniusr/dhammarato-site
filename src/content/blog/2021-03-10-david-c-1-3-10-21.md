### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, David, you asked the question basically that you don't know what to do. And, uh, let us put it this way. All right, I know on a, uh, I've, I've seen a Reddit teaching, where the guy says that he's practiced meditation for 50 years, and that he knows the difference between deep meditation and the beginner's meditation. So he's talking about the, I guess, the pride of practicing meditation for 50 years, and that he was doing that in response to a remark that someone made, that there's really only one thing to do for the very beginner and for the advanced student. There's still only one real thing to do, and that is, is to purify the mind or to clean out the mind. That's really the only thing that is to be done. That's the primary skill. But there is a lot of secondary skills that we need, and those secondary skills wind up being the method. Then when we combine this set of skills together, we come up with a complete package or a method. I use the word method intentionally because method Means, uh, like for instance, how do you open the door? The method is you take the key, you put it in, you turn the lock, you turn the knob, and you open the door, right? Key insertion, turn, turn, open. You got that? All right, so that's simple. Exactly. That's all there is to it. And so we need that set of skills. One is to get the key. The other one is to put the key in. The other one is to turn the lock. And the other one is to open the door. This is the method, except that in the translation out of the Pali into English, it gets translated not into the word method, but into the word path, with the idea that this year you get a key And next year you think about putting it in a lock, and the year after that you do the turning. Yeah, you got to be on the path, all right? Slowly, slowly, step after step. And so, uh, this is where the Eightfold Noble Path becomes confusing, because people think of it as a path in the sense of a path like an animal trail. An Indian trail, or a freeway, or a highway, or something like that that has to do to get from here to there over time and distance. That's what a path is for. But the word path can also mean another thing in the sense of— you've heard the word way and also the word via, which is Italian and Latin and whatnot like that. And so you could think of a road as a way, like the highway, right? A high road. Okay. But we also use the word way in the sense of a method. Oh, well, this is the way you open the door, right? Okay. So the question is, are we going to be able to take this long-term structure idea out of it and recognize that there really is all of these little skills, just have to be done right now. And that now is right now for the absolute very beginner, or whether somebody's had 70 years of meditation experience, is to still— the thing to do is to clear out the mind. Okay, okay. Hopefully after 70 years of meditation practice Somebody's developed those skills to where the beginner is— it doesn't have so many skills. So basically then, what the real practice is, is the practice of skill development. Okay, okay. But every time that you're doing it, it's doing it, and that you're doing it and practicing that skill, which means that at another time you can count on the skill practice that you put in here will now bring you to a higher skill level, right? And you can see that in— right, we can see that in learning how to read, we can see that in playing a musical instrument, right, uh, in all kinds of things. It's that way here too. So we actually have a few skills to be developed, and the first skill to be developed is one's right view, to know the difference between right view and wrong view. And as that skill develops it gets more noble, higher class, and with the understanding of what is what. In other words, we begin to see things more clearly because we've been practicing looking at things to see them more clearly.

**Speaker B:** I got you.

**Speaker A:** And so, okay, so the second skill is Sati, and Sati is to wake up and to remember to look, to apply this new way of looking. The Noble View is to keep investigating, keep looking. That unlike ordinary society, most people look for something because they're trying to find a solution, right? Or they're trying to build a concept, or they're trying to come to a conclusion, right?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Well, what concludes in this moment may not be what concludes in the next moment. Even though we've come to a conclusion in this moment, we still need to investigate the next moment. Of course, right? Because most people, once they come to a conclusion, they stop looking. I already know all of that, been there, done that, and I don't have to look at it anymore.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, in my experience, there's always more to find. So That's why I'm here, to wake

**Speaker A:** up and to keep looking. Okay, the third skill is the skill of one's right effort. And what is one's right effort? Is the right effort to see wrong view as wrong view, coming to conclusions. Okay, and to see right view as right view, which means to keep looking. One is one's right effort, then, is to not just change the view from wrong view to right view, but also it is to change this thought in this moment from right thought, from wrong thought or unwholesome thought into a wholesome thought. This is the primary skill, in fact, that if we can keep changing the mind, because we already know enough of right view to distinguish often between what is right thought and what is unwholesome thought.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** But as the skills develop, we'll be able to discern that better, so that some things that we used to think were wrong view were in fact right view. But it is also the vice versa— things that we used to think that was right is actually wrong. But we're investigating things now. An example of that would be junk thoughts. Most people think that it's okay just to have a bunch of junk thoughts in the mind because junk thoughts are a whole lot better than unwholesome thoughts. And yet junk thoughts is nothing but restlessness, just jumping around.

**Speaker B:** There's a lot of that here.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I understand. And so as we begin to investigate more and more, we begin to discern more and more so that we can refine this judgment about what is wholesome thought and what is unwholesome thought. And so one's right effort is to change unwholesome thoughts into wholesome thoughts. Now this is directly into the suttas, no implications about it. However, I will add an additional one, and that is the additional one that is implied through the practice of Anapanasati, the way that it's stated, is then would be one's right effort also besides changing the content of the mind from something unwholesome to wholesome, would be also changing the breathing from something unwholesome to something wholesome, in the sense that the ordinary breathing that people have is a shallow breathing based upon conservation, and that we're going to change that into breathing that is rich.

**Speaker B:** You mean like the belly?

**Speaker A:** Well, we're going to actually start breathing deeply in the sense of oxygenating the body as well as cleaning the body. Why? Because if you're breathing, exhaling, and you're breathing it in a shallow way, then most of the air that's in the lungs stays in the lungs on that out-breath. But if we start breathing in and out longer, then that out-breath is going to be more of an expansive, let us say, trash-taking out. Because basically what we're looking at is we're going to be lowering the pH level of the blood, because carbonic acid is carbon dioxide and water, and you know the blood's got a lot of water in it. You also know that it's got carbon dioxide, okay? So if we can get the carbon dioxide out of the blood and get a lot of oxygen in the blood, then we're going to be vibrantly alive, tingling alive, healthy, unpolluted in the body itself. This is why the breathing is said in the suttas— he understood he understands or he knows that this is a long in-breath. And then the next sentence is that he understands or knows this is Anapanasati, in fact, is mindfulness, or the Sati. I'm mindful that this is going to be a long out-breath. I'm intentionally making it a long out-breath. In fact, I like the word sigh, because the sigh is a complete release.

**Speaker B:** Are you suggesting this should be done all the time?

**Speaker A:** I'm suggesting that it can be done when you remember to do it and take the right effort to do it. There's all the time stuff is an unwholesome thought.

**Speaker B:** Gotcha. Fair enough.

**Speaker A:** Future-oriented. And it has the implication, look how much work I've got to do.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah, it does.

**Speaker A:** Instead of this breath is marvelous, right?

**Speaker B:** Right now.

**Speaker A:** Right now, this breath. I remember this breath. So this is one's right effort. Okay. The next point of the Eightfold Noble Path I'll introduce now, and that is in The Pali, it is known as Samma Sanghappa, and that is translated in various ways. One way to translate it correctly is right thought. Another way to translate it incorrectly is right intention. Why? Because intention has to do with wanting something you don't have. Right. Okay. But the best translation of all is right attitude. Right attitude, right?

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And what is that? It's the attitude that we have will actually determine what kind of thoughts we have.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, agreed.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so if we have the attitude of a victim— what do you mean I've got to take a deep breath all the time? Good. Versus the lion, which is, I like this breath,

**Speaker B:** right? This feels good.

**Speaker A:** This feels good. This breath is marvelous. And if we don't have that attitude that the breath is marvelous, there's an easy way to look at it this way, and that is stop breathing for 3 minutes. Don't breathe until you recognize that, hey, this next in-breath is going to be really nice. I'm going to really like this one, right? And then you're going, wait a minute, that's true of every one of them. Every breath is a proof positive I'm still alive, I'm still here, right? Because the last breath that we take is an out-breath. They call it expire.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they do.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, when we expire, there's always an out-breath, and then you don't take another in-breath. So taking that in-breath should be marvelous because it's going to keep you alive. If you don't take that next in-breath in this moment, you're going to die. Now isn't that marvelous, that breath? Now when we look at it from that perspective Yeah, okay. And going back to what we were talking about before we turned the video recorder on, I wanted to touch on that. And this is an interesting point in time to do it. A lot about what the Buddha is teaching has to do with becoming fearless, that we begin to manage these feelings. If we can learn to manage and control the breath and we can learn to manage and control the mind. If we learn and manage control the breath and the mind, we can learn to control the feelings so that we are no longer driven by the feelings, the feelings of fear, anger, lust, sadness, grief. These are— they call them emotions, and you can hear the word motion in there. They move people, right? Force. They drive us. And they drive us because we're out of control with them. Or if we can befriend them, take control of them, harness their energy, and put them to work, right? Okay. And so that way we become friends with our fear, that in fact our fear has kept us alive. Many, many times teenagers would have been dead unless they got afraid of what they were about to do, and then they'd have a second thought. Wait a minute, I don't want to do that. That's dangerous, and that's kept them alive. And there's a whole lot of people that are dead meat now because they didn't recognize the fear, right? Fear therefore has a value, it's got a use. The problem with it is, is that it's often premature, or what is called a false positive, right? What does that mean? That means that fear arises in circumstances where it's inappropriate for fear to arise.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I get that. I do. I have that happen all the time. Okay, that happened with you when I'm trying to like figure out if I should call you or message you or what. Like, I'm just saying, I get it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay, so, um, what, uh, is part of the Anapanasati Anapanasati practice is that if we can come up to that attitude of being a lion, then that also has the attitude that I can handle this present moment. And that in the sutta it's expressed this way, that when the student says that no matter how obstructed the mind becomes, or no matter how obstructed or what kind of hindrances, or how often they occur, or what strength they have. The meditator knows that he can throw that stuff out, clean out his mind, take a deep breath, and come back to this present moment. Right now, that's a knowledge. That means that that's an attitude change, right?

**Speaker B:** And that's based— that's what I've heard of, but I didn't know if it actually existed.

**Speaker A:** It's the first step of the nobility. This is the first step. When you have the right attitude that you can handle this moment, the Buddha says that that's the first knowledge that is noble, supramundane, a factor of the path, and not held by ordinary people. Because most ordinary people who are in the victim's position say, well, things do come along that I can't handle. Things happen and I should be prepared. I got to go work because if I don't work and accumulate money, then there'll come a day that I'm hungry and I can't handle that, right? But what if you have the idea that, yeah, some days I'm going to be hungry, I can handle that, then I don't have to work?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's one way to look at it.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so that attitude is what we're looking at. That change of attitude to a can-do attitude is a noble change. It's the first step in the path to nobility, to leave the world, which means to leave our dependence on the world. That I am not a victim to the world, I don't depend upon the world, I don't expect the world to take care of me because look what kind of job it's done so far. If I wake up to see how the world has taken care of me, I'll say, thank you very much, Daddy. I don't need your care anymore. I can do this myself, all by myself. Thank you very much. And that's the winner's attitude, you see, right? The winner's attitude is, I can do this, I can handle this. This also comes to the point of death. This is why in Buddhism it's very good to start contemplating death. In fact, you can do that with that in-breath. If I don't take this in-breath, I'm going to die. Am I ready to do that too? Because that's going to happen. There's going to come a day when you better be ready for that, because it's going to happen.

**Speaker B:** Well, I talked to that therapist that I had mentioned before this video started about that, and because I've thought a lot about death and and he is in a position where he's facing down his death.

**Speaker A:** You are too, you just don't know it yet. It's right in front of you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but he's— it's more real for him than it is for me right now.

**Speaker A:** Like, right. So in other words, something got through to him that now he sees death right in front of him. When you see death right in front of you, You might do it years before it actually bites you, but death is right here for every one of us. It is one breath away,

**Speaker B:** right?

**Speaker A:** It is one breath away. If you don't take that one next breath, you're going to die.

**Speaker B:** When we talked about it, what I told him was, I want to go into it with eyes open. I want to— I want to be present for my death.

**Speaker A:** And so as the old man, if it's bothering him now— I mean, he's 80-something, he ought to have gotten enough out of life already. He can look death in the face and say, hey buddy, where you been? I've been waiting on you. I'm tired of this old world. But no, he's still clinging to life. He's afraid. There's still fear left in there. That means basically that he hasn't, as a psychologist, all these years actually confronted death. And be ready to die. Because if in fact you are ready to die, then that means that you are fearless. If you're not ready to die, then you're afraid of death. But if you're ready to die any moment, then you can live very well this moment, right? Because you can be free of being dead the next.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, talk about being fearless. Because the worst thing that can happen to you is to die.

**Speaker A:** So I've heard that before. In fact, that was about the next thing I was going to say, so you're a step ahead of me already, right? So if death's the worst thing that can happen and you're not afraid of that, then why be afraid of anything? We need to tell ourselves that over and over and over again. Because things will happen and we'll become afraid. We'll have business to do. Oh, I've got to go do that business. If I don't get that business done, something bad will happen. And so that whole idea of something bad will happen is the whole idea of impending doom. That's why we have the quality of the fear. This fear, by the way, is a mechanism that we're born with. It's built into the DNA, and it is called by some scientists as the a self-preservation instinct, right? I've heard of that, right? The self-preservation instinct means that which is inside of us is trying to keep the mechanism, the human organism, alive and operating. Without that survival mechanism, all them teenagers would have been dead long before they were teenagers. In fact, they wouldn't have ever been born. Humanity would have been wiped out centuries ago. Right, if everybody was absolutely fearless,

**Speaker B:** yeah,

**Speaker A:** they clutched each other to death or killed each other off. Yeah, without any fear at all. Okay, so that means that the fear actually is a valuable mechanism. This kept you alive, right?

**Speaker B:** Well, I mean, it's pointing at something. Like, generally, we may not always be seeing things clearly, but when it's operating

**Speaker A:** appropriately— when we do see things clearly, then with wisdom we can discern with a wisdom eye or a wisdom mind what in fact is dangerous in this present moment or not. To where this self-preservation instinct is an old, old mechanism that has been pre-programmed literally hundreds of thousands of years ago.

**Speaker B:** But with that said, is the goal to become fearless, or is the goal to recognize the fear and be okay with it? Or are they the same thing?

**Speaker A:** They're the same thing, basically. Okay, they're the same thing. Because the fearlessness is basically that we have to get rid of is the things that we're afraid of that are about to happen but haven't happened yet. For instance, if a criminal puts a gun in your face, cocks the hammer, and says, if you don't tell me where that jewelry is, I'm going to blow your head off right now, okay, he's trying to make you afraid. Yeah, by threatening your life. But in fact, he hasn't shot you yet. You're not dead yet, right? Still alive. So this is just a threat. Now we have to use the wisdom eye to begin to figure out, is this a real threat or is this an idle threat? That more— in some cases, you're going to die anyway whether you tell him where the goods are or not. Then in fact, he's only going to keep you alive long enough to find out where those goods are, and then he's going to kill you anyway, right? Or he may not intend to kill you at all, he just really wants that stuff really badly. And you, with wisdom eye, if you're looking, paying attention to what's going on, you can figure those things out, which is what the star of the movie is going to do, to where everybody else is going to be victim to this.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** And he's not going to be able to figure out what's going on. And so he's going to either spill the beans and die, or spill the beans and live when he didn't have to spill the beans at all.

**Speaker B:** Well, yeah, I mean, if the mind is calm in that situation and you can objectively look at it, then yes, you would be able to determine that. I think for most people, their mind's not calm. It panics.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, exactly. Why did it panic? Is because of the fear. The fear is what causes the panic. The fear is in fact is what causes all of the adrenaline, all the cortisol. It changes the whole body chemistry to get ready for fight or flight. Well, guess what? In this case, you're not going to flight and you're not going to fight, right? But all of your body chemistry and all the blood is designed for fighting and flighting, and thinking is out the window. Mm-hmm. Yeah, when we are angry or when we're upset or full of fear, we can't think straight. And this is well, well known.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I get it.

**Speaker A:** All over, all over the place. I can give you dozens and dozens of examples.

**Speaker B:** I have plenty of personal experience with getting angry and having to step away for a moment and calm down before I can see things clearly. So I get it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay, so that's the whole point. If we can train the mind then to stay calm and not react to the anger, we not react to the fear. In fact, anger doesn't exist without fear, because actually anger is that which brings the power to make us feel that we can handle the situation, because ultimately we're really afraid.

**Speaker B:** So it's an overcompensation, right?

**Speaker A:** Anger is an overcompensation for fear, and it feels delicious because fear itself is powerless. It's a victim's position. But if we can turn that fear into anger, now we feel powerful. We have righteous anger. I'm right, I know what's correct and true.

**Speaker B:** I've never heard it quite put that way, but that is excellent. I agree.

**Speaker A:** So that's what anger is. Anger is actually the overcompensation of— you use the word yourself, how can you say that you never heard it that way before? Well,

**Speaker B:** I guess I never really knew. I mean, I don't know, it makes sense to me. I'm just thinking of my childhood, like there was a lot of anger, and that totally makes sense that it was the fear. It was my way of dealing with being afraid.

**Speaker A:** Well, you were taught how to do it that way.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, my dad had anger issues.

**Speaker A:** Right, and so we'd pick it up. Another thing is, is that even before we're out of diapers, we learned that someone in the family, maybe Daddy or Mom, one of them, perhaps both of them, has to go out every day, and they come home tired, and they don't like what they're doing when they're out there. And when they're at home, they complain about what happened when they're out there, and they call it a job, or they call it work. And so right from the very beginning, before we're even out of our diapers, we recognize that, hey, we're going to have to be like Daddy, we're going to have to go out and work and do things we don't want to do. Yeah, yeah. And then by the time we're 6, they put us to work. Learn your ABCs, clean your room. Yep. Put down that cell phone and do your homework.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And if you have a sibling, you're asked to be even bigger than you actually are. You're asked to be big when you're actually small. Don't wake the baby, bring mommy the diaper, like,

**Speaker A:** and you're trying— Mommy's little helper, right, exactly. Put them to work.

**Speaker B:** Yep, I get it.

**Speaker A:** And so we've been put to work and we don't actually enjoy the work that we're doing because nobody else enjoys it. We don't have a model for people enjoying our work. Though wise people will give that from time to time, even Einstein will say, "If you find a job you like, you never work again."

**Speaker B:** That sounds so nice.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and it doesn't exist. No, it doesn't. It's actually, if you use the word "job" and "work" the way that they're normally used, that's actually an oxymoron. Yeah, I think to have a job or work that you like is not work. No, it's work.

**Speaker B:** I think there are very few people that actually really, really enjoy everything about their jobs. I think there's a lot of people who enjoy parts of their job, but there are parts that they hate. I know I'm that way.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. You— do you know of Gorilla in the Mist?

**Speaker B:** I have, yeah, I've watched it.

**Speaker A:** Okay. She loved being with the gorillas. It was her bosses that she had trouble with, the real gorillas.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I can get that. Politics is nonsense.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so back to the point. Now we've covered 4 items of the Eightfold Noble Path: right view, right Sati, to wake up and look at it, because if you don't remember to practice these skills you're not going to practice them. For that reason, that's the power and the importance of Sati. That's why we want to do it once on the in-breath and once on the out-breath to really have Sati, to know that this is a long deep in-breath and to know that this is a long deep out-breath is to develop that Sati, to remember, to remember, to remember, to remember. Don't get distracted, come back and keep remembering, okay? Oftentimes the word concentration out of English language is used, but this is not actually concentration because concentration is something that you're doing in this moment, concentrating, getting tight, strong in this moment. What we're doing here is we're being very easy and relaxed this moment, long, deep in breath. And very relaxed, not concentrating, but remembering and focusing to take a long, deep out-breath. And concentration has nothing to do with it.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** But the word Sati is where this word concentration comes from, because that was in the misunderstanding of the language in the beginning. And so almost all translations of Samma, Arya, Samatha is called right noble concentration.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's what I thought it was.

**Speaker A:** I apparently am wrong, but it's not. A better way of using the word Samadhi means that it's collected together. Concentration means that you select things out. An example of that would be frozen concentrated orange juice. What does frozen concentrated orange juice do? It takes the water out. But nobody drinks frozen concentrated orange juice. Even if you let it thaw out to where it's no longer frozen but it's still concentrated orange juice, you don't want concentrated orange juice, you want Samadhi orange juice. You want to put things back together. So it explains— put the water back in it. So in that case, Samatha is exactly opposite of the word concentration.

**Speaker B:** So concentration would be exclude, whereas this includes.

**Speaker A:** Includes, exactly.

**Speaker B:** I get that.

**Speaker A:** An example of that would be that when all of the parts of an automobile come together, then the automobile parts— the engine, the wheels, the transmission the axles, the body, the frame, when all of that stuff comes together, then it becomes a system. And in General Systems Theory, the point is that things are greater, the system is, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. So the sum of the parts of an automobile is just automobile parts scattered all over the yard. But the sum of those automobile parts put together in a system we have an additional feature: transportation. Okay, transportation is something that is bigger than the sum of all of the parts, right? This is where we're— this is the point of Samadhi, going in that direction. Okay, another example would be a teepee, and a Western, uh, Native American a temporary shelter,

**Speaker B:** right?

**Speaker A:** I got it, right? Okay. How is the teepee made? You have long, thin, slender trees, maybe at most 3 inches in diameter going up. But the point is that we want them about 20 feet long, which is about 5 or 6 meters, maybe 7 meters long. Okay. With that, we can then take those and put them at a point and tie them off. To give stability so that all of the other poles can be placed around it in a circle. And then you can put animal skins and things around it to make the teepee. I guess what makes the teepee strong is the fact that all of those poles meet at the top. That's the Samadhi point. Many buildings in Asia are built that way. That's the whole point of an A-frame. Okay, right. There's the Samadhi point where things come together at an apex, right? You can call it a gable also, right? This is what we mean by Samatha, is when things get together, when they collect together at a unified point. And so we have Samatha in Jhana, and we have Samatha in the mind.

**Speaker B:** Well, if things are collected at a unified— if things are collected at a unified point, is that not concentration?

**Speaker A:** If you want to use the word that way, okay, just go use it that way someplace else because here that gets really confusing.

**Speaker B:** I know, that's why I'm asking. When I've heard of Samadhi, I think of Ramana Maharshi sitting in a cave, gone to the world like in bliss. I'm trying to picture it.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that's why it's important to take it out of magic, out of the world of magic, and put it into the world of reality. That's why I'm talking about teepees and concentrated orange juice, to make it real. Okay, okay, because the reality is, is that we do want to have a unified, organized mind. And in fact, right view, right noble view, right noble Sati, waking up, right noble effort, and right noble attitude come together to bring about a unified mind. This is the part of the Eightfold Noble Path that many people don't understand without reading the suttas very carefully. Okay, okay. But then we recognize that Sila for the noble is not a causative action, it's a resultant action. To where Buddhism is taught for children, or is taught in the beginning of the Triple Gem and the Five Precepts. The Five Precepts have to do with right noble action, right noble speech, and right noble livelihood, right? But we can practice that when the mind is still ordinary. We can practice Sila when the mind is ordinary as a way of actually training the mind to begin to see danger. Oh, it's dangerous to kill someone, therefore I shall refrain from killing someone. Okay. Or it's dangerous to rob someone on the street, Therefore, I will refrain from robbing people on the street. So that's the ordinary way of looking at it. But the noble way of looking at it is once the mind is noble, that means that we've already got everything collected together, we're complete, we're whole, we're unified, we're not missing anything. Therefore, there is nothing that I want to make me more complete. Which means I don't want anything. I'm good right now. If I've got everything I need right now and I'm good to go right now and I don't want anything right now, then I am free from doing the things that would get me the things that I want, right? Because I don't want anything. This is the noble way of looking at right speech, right action, and right livelihood is coming from the position you're already satisfied. Right, to where the mundane is, is that we get gratification in what we want. And so we want to get it in order to get the gratification, but we don't see the danger. I guess because we don't see the danger, we are stuck in the gratification. If we can see the danger, then we can see the escape. If we can see the danger, then we can say, wait a minute, I want out of this. But if you don't see the danger, then we're— we continue to attach to it. So there's waking up all along the way, waking up in the mundane, but eventually we wake up altogether to the point of, hey, I don't need anything, I'm already good. I don't think anything at all is dangerous.

**Speaker B:** That state is possible. That you can literally draw everything you need from within

**Speaker A:** in this present moment. Yes, you can do that right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no, I know. I, I have some experience with that. It just doesn't happen all the time.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so you get that if we can do it in this present moment, then you can do it in the next present moment. And then you begin to develop the right attitude: I can do this anytime, any next present moment. I've got the skills, I can handle that. I can do it one time. If I could get to the point that I'm good to go right now and I'm completely satisfied with everything right now, then I can do that again, right? And again and again. And so the first skill that we have to do is the first big skill, let's say, is the skill of getting ourselves into that state. And that state would be a state of freedom from suffering, Sukkha, which is in fact safe, no fear, secure, no dangers. Content, got enough, satisfied. And then along comes that next one, right noble attitude, and that's when we bring in the final additional quality of success. Success. Job well done. Did it. Did it then. Do it now, can do it next time too. Right attitude. So, we actually develop Anapanasati. Anapanasati is the technique of developing these skills that are part of the method. And yet many people don't understand that right attitude and right Sati and right effort, and right view are skills to be developed. But these things are very, very clear when we look at it from the position of Anapanasati, because the verb on each one of the stages says, "Thus he trains himself." Not a doubt about it. This is a training. This is a skill development. In fact, the operative word in Pali that's used all the time. When I say all the time, I'm talking about with every sutta, at least this word will be one time placed, if not dozens of times, and that's the word Bhavana, or Bhava, which means the development. In Paticcasamuppada, it is step number 10, development. We can actually think of it as pregnancy. That pregnancy has to happen before birth, right? You have to develop something, you have to develop the skill, and once the skill is developed, now that skill, that skill is, is, uh, useful. It's born, it's, uh, it's there. So the skill development or the training is what Anapanasati is all about. This is why it gets the name practice. What an important word this is! Practice, but meditation, I'm not sure that meditation is the right word at all for this, because the word meditation has heavy Christian roots, and it has the roots of contemplation. And basically what that means is contemplating the Holy, like taking the Trinity, or taking the mercy of Mother Mary, or there's all kinds of objects of meditation that you can take. And if they're very, very lucky, that will actually help focus the mind, because they actually are contemplating that and they're not having a mind full of unwholesome stuff. But they don't recognize that the whole training here is to keep the mind out of the unwholesome. So when they finish the meditation of thinking about the grace of Mother Mary, when they go out in the world, Mother Mary and her grace are gone with all this anger and frustration that occurs because they're not actually training, right, to get the mind into the position that it can handle that present moment out in the world.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So this is not meditation that we're doing. This is training. This is like practicing the piano.

**Speaker B:** I get you. There's skills that you're building.

**Speaker A:** It's a skill to be developed.

**Speaker B:** Okay, fair enough.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and so in Anapanasati, there's these various points, and we can take it in order and miss the whole point because there is a natural order of this awakening. For instance, Sati comes first. If you don't remember to practice the skill, you can't practice it. And if you practice this skill, it will lead then to the practice of that skill. If you try to practice that skill, you'll fail. You need to practice this skill before you can do that skill. An example of that is fingering. You have to learn to practice fingering on the piano. So how do they do that? They practice scales. But in the practice of the scales, there's thumb, index, middle finger, followed by thumb, index, middle finger, and then you can play the scale that way. Da da da da da da da, and that's just how you do it. If you don't practice that, you can't play music. You have to practice scales.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay? That's the point then, is that some of these skills have to be done in order to practice other skills. So we can look at it from that perspective then, is the skills, the order of the skill development is the way that we should look at Anapanasati. Okay, so the first skill is Sati, to wake up, and then to take a look at what's going on. This is basically then step 9 of Anapanasati, is that wake up and take a look, investigate the mind, and then the next thing is to change the content of the mind with one's right effort to take out the unwholesome and put in the wholesome. This is in Anapanasati called gladdening the mind or brightening the mind. Okay, okay. And this is step 10 of Anapanasati. And the way that I use it or talk to students about it is by saying it like this, and that is that you have spent your whole life talking yourself into feeling bad. Unwholesome thoughts give rise to unwholesome feelings. Now is the time for you to talk yourself into feeling good. Wholesome thoughts will gender wholesome feelings. So the first thing we do is that we start changing the thoughts—Samma Sanghappa. By changing those thoughts, we also begin to change the attitude because the thought is the voice of the attitude. [Speaker:ARAHANT] Yes. [Speaker:DHAMMARATO] So, if we start to develop gladdening the mind and brightening the mind, then eventually the attitude will become more naturally changing. So we can think of Samma Sanghappa as both right thought and also right attitude. But the attitude is a deeper thing than just the thought that we have, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Okay, so you mentioned trash thoughts earlier. Let's say, hypothetically speaking, trash thoughts arise, you notice them, you remember to notice. Should there be a shifting of the mind to a wholesome thought?

**Speaker A:** Like, yeah, and the first way of doing that would be, aha, I see, that's a junk thought, right? Or something like that. Let's say that you're on the way to work driving your car, and on the way to work you're thinking about the work, right? That's the junk thought right there. While you're driving to work, you're thinking about work, and in fact you're not at work when you're driving the car to work. Work, you're driving the car to work. If you pay attention to what you're doing with the car, you'll probably make it to work. But a lot of people who are thinking about work while they're driving the car won't make it to work, they'll make it to the hospital instead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, maybe.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, that's right. But why?

**Speaker B:** Or drive themselves crazy,

**Speaker A:** right? They might wind up at work and crazy too. Exactly. So what we're talking about then is that we need to be able to focus the mind to come into this present moment, because the junk thoughts are going to be thoughts of the future, right, or the past. Thoughts about what am I going to do when I get to work, thoughts about what happened yesterday that gave rise to the work that I'm going to be doing today. So thoughts about the past, thoughts about the future are often the kinds of thoughts that we have with a restless mind, because there's not very many now places to go with the restless mind. So the restless mind almost always goes to the past or the future.

**Speaker B:** Well, yeah, because now's boring.

**Speaker A:** I need to go— now is just now. The boredom is optional.

**Speaker B:** I'm being sarcastic.

**Speaker A:** I know, I know, but it's not the now that's boring is the restlessness.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** That in fact, when we use the word boring, what we're actually indicating is now is not good enough. In that thought, I want something else. And that's the restlessness, that wanting. And so the mind keeps jumping from one junk thought to the next junk thought. Yep. In a state of desire, in a state of wanting. When we recognize that state of desire and wanting comes from those kinds of thoughts, we can recognize if I change the thoughts that I'm having, the thoughts of everything really is all right, then that's not going to give rise to the desire for the things that I was thinking about when I wanted them.

**Speaker B:** If practiced long enough, this would seem to lead to a quiet mind.

**Speaker A:** Actually, if you don't— it's not a matter of long enough, it's a matter of doing it right now. If you do this right now, you get a quiet mind right now. It might not last very long, but hey, success is success. Congratulate yourself for doing it right now.

**Speaker B:** I got you. Now you're right, you're 100% right.

**Speaker A:** Well, this is why Western Buddhism has the problems that it does, is because the Westerners who see Buddhism, they don't recognize this quality is so powerful. It's so powerful that that was the name that the Buddha gave himself. He did not call himself Buddha. That didn't come until centuries later.

**Speaker B:** Really?

**Speaker A:** Right. You know what he referred to himself or called himself? The Tathagata. Tathagata.

**Speaker B:** I've heard that word before.

**Speaker A:** You know what it means?

**Speaker B:** No, not at all.

**Speaker A:** The worst possible translation is 'thus gone one.'

**Speaker B:** The blown out one, I think that's how I've heard it.

**Speaker A:** Okay, all right. But they're missing the word 'thus' because it's an Old English word. Why? Um, 100 years ago they were using 100-year-old words. I don't know. But now we've got the word thus, it's 200 years old, and we don't use it in our language anymore, right? Thus gone one means the one who has come to the present moment. If in fact the person who is referring to this is in the present moment, then that guy comes to the present moment. But if we're in the past and in the future, then when he goes to the present moment. He's going someplace that you're not. And so that's why they have the Thus-Gone One. He doesn't go, he comes to this present moment.

**Speaker B:** This really is really simple,

**Speaker A:** isn't it though? It's just really now. Be here now. Exactly. That's what Ram Dass says. Uh, Eckhart Tolle actually has a book called The Power of This Present Moment. And he's been on this present moment. Guess what? Neither one of them were original. This goes right back to the Buddha. This is the teaching of the Buddha, to be here in this present moment. Thusness. This is it. This, not that. Not that over there, and not that back then.

**Speaker B:** Ah, that's such a lovely message. I love it.

**Speaker A:** So this is how we're practicing to wake up and to be in this present moment, which means to no longer have thoughts about that, but to have thoughts about this, right? Because this is what we have, that we don't have. So if we are in this and we have thoughts of that In a way, that's magical thinking.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** Whether that is Chicago or whether that is the next future life, right?

**Speaker B:** Because it doesn't exist here.

**Speaker A:** Because it doesn't exist here now. That this here and now is noble, right?

**Speaker B:** It's all that's required.

**Speaker A:** And if you just take a deep breath and say, hey, I don't have to think about that anymore, the next mind-moment will be quiet. Ah, that relaxation is actually a mind-moment, to actually relax, no thoughts going on, just paying attention to, ah, the mind is quiet. For the beginner, you don't need 50 or 70 years of practice, that in fact the guy who is saying that my 50 years of practice means something, means that he's been practicing wrongly this whole time.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** because he keeps expecting something out of it. He keeps improving. No, you can't improve. This present moment is all there is. It does not need any improvements.

**Speaker B:** That's extremely common though amongst people measuring spiritual attainments and things of that nature.

**Speaker A:** Attainment is the word for it, exactly. And they take— and they take Buddha's— and they say, look at all these attainments that Buddhism has, let me go get some of that. Let's do some capitalism on Buddhism. Let's go get something, right? Let's go rob it. Let's go drain it dry, get all the good stuff out of it, then it's mine. Yep. And then we got to pull up the ladder because we don't want those people to get any of it.

**Speaker B:** Right, right, because they're unworthy. They didn't sit for 50 years.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's a good one. I like that. Okay, so now we've got a new way of thinking about how to do Anapanasati. Let's put all of that together then. So the first thing is mindfulness, to wake up. That needs to be fully done, and we'll talk about what full wake-up means. Because waking up to the hindrances and then say, oh, monkey mind, all these hindrances are so much of a problem— that's just more hindrance, right? Why? Because even that hindrance is hindering you from being joyful, right? In fact, right then we're being regretful and remorseful, right? And we're not— and we're being regretful and remorseful over what we've been doing all along anyway. So now our Buddhist meditation is adding to Dukkha, not subtracting from it.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** That's very, very typical of Western Buddhism. It's just another scoop of Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** But we have to change that from when we recognize the mind has wandered away, that two things. One is, is that it's just doing what it's always been doing. Congratulations, you just see what it's doing. And that's Sati: congratulate yourself for the fact that you can see the Dukkha that you couldn't see before. And that also gladdens and brightens the mind. The Buddha said this at a particular place in time that had enormous impact on his understanding, and we'll talk about that later. But the statement that he made is, "Aha!" I see you, Mara. And he was talking about the unwholesome thought that was in the mind right then, and he woke up to it and he says, why am I thinking about that? An example of why would I be thinking about the buddies that used to hang around and now they're gone because I got fat? That's just Dukkha, that's just suffering. I don't need to think about those guys, they're not here. I need to think about what the mind is doing.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so aha, I see you, Mara. That's the thought. But guess what? That thought is a new thought. To be able to have that thought, the thought of the hindrances is gone now. People say, well, how do I change the content of the mind? You can't, right? Not really. But the mind is very much like a conveyor belt, right?

**Speaker B:** Right, if the noticing of it can allow it to change.

**Speaker A:** The noticing of it does change it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. No, I know, I get that, I get that.

**Speaker A:** Okay, it does change this present moment, and when we have the thought, "Aha, I see you, Mara," that opens things up immediately to then add wholesome thoughts. In fact, "Aha, I see you, Mara," is a a wholesome thought, right? Now we can continue wholesome thoughts like, well, I'm glad I don't have to think about that anymore, at least not for right now, right? That email can wait. I do not have to think about that. I can be happy right now. The way that we can think of it is, is that if we think of something to do, then we go ahead and do it because it's supposed to be done, it needs to be done. But we do it without any joy. But if we recognize right in that present moment, when we think about that email and we recognize, I don't want to write that email, then we can say, aha, I see that thought, I don't want to write the email. Let me get my mind back into a good state. And so I'm going to take a deep breath, have some happy, wholesome thoughts. And next time that email comes up, if I have another bad feeling about it, I can do the same thing again. Within a few minutes, maybe an hour or a day later, and I'll have a thought about that email. I say, well, I can handle that now. I've got enough joy, I can handle that email joyfully. I know I've got it because I can do it now because I've been practicing and I have the right attitude that I can handle that email happily right now.

**Speaker B:** That hits close to home. Procrastination is a huge problem of mine.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's because you know that you'll hate it if you do it, therefore you don't want to do it.

**Speaker B:** Sometimes. Some— yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so that's the way of dealing with procrastination, is by not dealing with the work at all. It's got nothing to do with what you've got to do. It's got to do with how you feel, right? And if you keep coming back to, I've got to gladden the mind Relax. And as I relax and gladden the mind, this Sukkha will come on its own because it's being encouraged directly. Encouraged like having thoughts about things are actually safe now, that if I don't do that email, the world's not going to come to an end. I will take the next breath. The cops are not going to come and break the door down because I don't answer that email right now. The guy who I'm writing the email is probably not even going to open it right now if I send it to him right now.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And so why should I worry about right now? I don't have to worry about right now. I can be happy right now.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And we start practicing that. So we can say there are no gorillas in the room. I'm safe right now. That email, if I don't write it, I'm still safe. I'm safe. And so we look at that, we give us that word, it's safe, and we begin to develop the feeling of being safe. Because we are wise to the point that we actually are safe, and it's only the false positive of the self-preservation instinct that is telling us that we're not safe, because that's its habit of going around saying, "Danger, danger, danger, safe, danger, Will Robinson, danger, danger, danger." Okay, that's the self-preservation mechanism.

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** But wisdom, we can take a look around and say, "Hey, wait a minute, there's no danger."

**Speaker B:** here, right?

**Speaker A:** There's no danger. Isn't that nice? I don't have to go get my weapons and get all dressed for battle. Yeah, there's no danger. Okay, so this is how we build Sukkha, is we talk ourselves into Sukkha by saying there's no danger. In fact, everything is really nice right now. My, what a wonderful moment. Everything's going to be all right. And so these are the kind of wholesome thoughts that we would have about this present moment. And those wholesome thoughts that gladden the mind will bring about this feeling of Sukkha. As I said before, we've been spending all these years talking ourselves into feeling bad. Now is the time to talk ourselves into feeling good, right? That's the practice. Once you keep doing that over and over again, then we add that fourth ingredient, and that fourth ingredient is the Samma Sanghappa, which is the right noble attitude. And in Anapanasati, that's expressed as satisfaction of success, the "I can do this," which gives rise to the feeling of the champion. Because the champion is going to feel better than the victim, or the one who has lost. Imagine that you had a 15-round title boxing match, and they go for 15 rounds about each other, and then they have— nobody gets to knock out, and after 15 rounds, it's a judgment call that the judges judge. He won and he lost, right? Now they both go back into their dressing rooms or whatever, and get a massage, guess which one feels satisfied that the fight is over? What a relief it is to be finished with that 15-round knockout. They're both going to feel, wow, I'm glad that's over, right? But the guy who won is going to have something else involved, and that's the satisfaction of the success that he won. And he has the joy that goes along with it.

**Speaker B:** What about pride?

**Speaker A:** Well, let's not work with that too much because that's a deeper issue. Then in fact, let's use some pride if we want to, to say in the sense of I can do this is part of the attitude. Okay, you could say that in pride, pride is the training wheels of the winner.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** So that once he learns to ride that winner's bicycle, he doesn't need those training wheels of pride anymore, right? He doesn't have to prove himself anymore. Okay. So yeah, all right. So I would say it's okay for you to feel congratulatory to yourself. That I can do this. In fact, the Pali word for this is Piti. Now that's often misunderstood, but a fairly close translation would be joy. But the joy that we're talking about is the joy of success, the joy of having the job well done. The Buddha talks about that, that the job is done, what needed to be done has been done, and there is nothing left to be done right now. Success. I've done the job. What was the job to do? Throw out the hindrances, to get myself back into a state of relaxation and peace, right? That was the job to be done, to throw out the hindrances, gladden the mind, take a deep breath, energize the body, feel comfortable, safe, secure, satisfied. And then the last cherry on top is success. Ta-da! We got it. Can do this stuff.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I agree. I just— I see that as dangerous.

**Speaker A:** But, and that is a skill to be developed. Yeah, if it is done wisely. Then it is not dangerous.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I would agree with that. I just— the pride aspect of it, I'll put that aside for now. We can come back to it.

**Speaker A:** Okay, because in fact the pride has ignorance of it, right? What is that ignorance? The ignorance that I am, right? I did this, I did this. Let's not work too much about with the I, but go more with the success.

**Speaker B:** I got you. That's fair. That's a good way to approach it in the beginning. I could see that.

**Speaker A:** So that's now Anapanasati. We now have in fact touched on 5 ingredients of Samadhi. What number 1 is, the mind is free from hindrances. The mind no longer has unwholesome thoughts. Because the mind is free from hindrances and have no unwholesome thoughts, that means that now Sukkha can arise, because the Dukkha was coming out of unwholesome thoughts. If we have no unwholesome thoughts now, we can relax into a state of well-being. With that, we develop the attitude of, "I can do this again," or not necessarily, "I can do this again," But this can be good done again. This is nice. This can be done over and over again. And that's where the success— now we've got three. We've got freedom from hindrances, we've got Sukkha, and we've got Piti. These are three items that are in the Anapanasati Sutta as training tools, things to be trained on. But these are also aspects of first Jhana. The next thing is about the breathing, that when we're breathing in long and breathing out long with Sati and mindful of it, then the mind is energized, oxygenated, free from pollution, and because of that, we can in fact focus the mind and put it to work. We can actually apply the mind to something that's wholesome. And then the last final ingredient to be a skill to be developed is to be able to sustain that. So the first thing, the first skill is to get ourselves into this state, and then the second skill to be developed is to maintain it. And what is it that's being maintained? Freedom from hindrances, Sukkha. Piti, and vicha and vichara, which means the mind can be applied to this and then it can sustain it. These are the factors of First Jhana. So Anapanasati is designed and built around the practice of getting ourselves into a really good happy state, not mindless. We can still think, that the thoughts that we're thinking are wholesome thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Gotcha. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that's the way to walk around and live your life.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it is. Might as well be happy.

**Speaker A:** And when you're— and when you're not in that state, to remember to get into it, and then remember to stay in it for a while. And then something else will knock you out of it, and the hindrances will come back. Never mind, start again.

**Speaker B:** Yep. I can do that.

**Speaker A:** Because if the hindrances come back and we say, oh no, those darn hindrances are back, oh poor me, we can have a pity party. We can have a full-blown pity party about meditation now.

**Speaker B:** Yep. Oh, woe is me, I can't do it.

**Speaker A:** Oh, I can't do it. Oh, meditation is so hard.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I might as well just give up.

**Speaker A:** Might as well. A lot of people do. Others will have the thought, "Oh, well, I need this stuff for meditation even though it's so hard. Let me really, really work on it. After all, we need concentration, don't we?"

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** So let me concentrate hard enough. And they don't even recognize that by doing that they're still in hindrance.

**Speaker B:** Right. I get it.

**Speaker A:** Great.

**Speaker B:** It's simple. It's super simple.

**Speaker A:** It is. It is, David. All you have to do now is remember. Right.

**Speaker B:** And that's the trick, is to remember. Because you get stuck. Well, if I'm describing what sometimes can happen to me, I can get— you get caught up in the flow of of phenomena.

**Speaker A:** Um, especially we can use the word buttons, triggers, and anchors. Yeah, all three will describe what we're talking about. In the, in the 1970s, we talked about pushing your buttons. Yeah, I, I remember many, many years I went with, uh, you can't push my buttons because you don't know where they are. Only my mommy can press my buttons.

**Speaker B:** Fair.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so, uh, that's the same thing as triggered. People get triggered. Some event will happen and they will become attached to it. That's the same thing as having their buttons pushed, right? Or the other way of talking about it is, is that those things anchor us back. It brings us to this point and we are stuck there because the anchor is set. Right, you have to weigh anchor.

**Speaker B:** I have some of those. I'm aware of some of them. I'm sure there are ones I'm not aware of.

**Speaker A:** Well, this is actually then the place to practice Anapanasati, is when the hindrances are most likely to occur. But wait a minute, if that's the case, then the beginner is most likely going to get overwhelmed. Because we've got so many buttons, so many triggers, and so many anchors that just keep coming and coming and coming. So in the beginning, we need to isolate ourselves from as many of the anchors and buttons as we can. That's why the meditator will go into seclusion to get away from the world, because it's the world that keeps pressing the buttons that we have, right? So we can get away and have no buttons being pushed. From the world, and then we recognize, wait a minute, there's something else in there that keeps pushing these buttons. What are they? There's those unwholesome thoughts, right? They keep pushing those buttons.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** And so now we have to remove not just the outside world and be secluded from that, we also need to be secluded from the hindrances, the internal button pushers.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And when we practice that, we begin then to soften the world's buttons so that the world can't push the buttons so much anymore because we're not pushing them on the inside so much. We're not reinforcing that. And so those buttons then become weak. Sometimes they have to be pushed and pushed and pushed and pushed before finally the circuit is done. You've seen that on keyboard. Sometimes you press that A— I mean, you're typing along and you look back and, hey, wait a minute, I didn't push that A key because it didn't show up on the text. Yeah, right. Okay, those are the kinds of things. Now the buttons, even though they get pushed, nothing happens, right?

**Speaker B:** Because it's just immediately seen through.

**Speaker A:** Because we can see through them immediately, and eventually they don't have the power that they used to have.

**Speaker B:** For you, is it just instant?

**Speaker A:** Nothing is ever instant. Everything is a process, and every little piece and instant of that process is happening right here in this moment.

**Speaker B:** Fair enough.

**Speaker A:** So this moment is all that matters.

**Speaker B:** Fair enough. You're right.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the teaching of the Buddha. It's not me. I didn't figure that stuff out. I'm too stupid to have figured that out. That's why we all pay homage to the Buddha. Why did he figure out something that was really hard and complex and people don't get it often,

**Speaker B:** right?

**Speaker A:** But that's the only thing that he had, was that he figured out something and nobody else at that time could figure out, right? But once he figures it out and tells other people, they can apply that and figure it out for themselves and You've got a whole bunch of nobles running around.

**Speaker B:** World will be a happier place, that's for certain.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's— I mean, the world is a happy place now. I've got no beef with it. You have a beef with it.

**Speaker B:** You may not, I— and I may not, but there are a lot of people who do.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's their problem. I know it's not your problem.

**Speaker B:** Doesn't feel like it though.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's because they keep pushing your button.

**Speaker B:** Well, I mean, I'm allowed to have some compassion, right? Like some empathy for— Oh gosh, we

**Speaker A:** could talk another hour about what is compassion. But let me give you the short version. Just because somebody, uh, let's say you're out on a ship or boat, a smaller boat, a big fishing boat, maybe a 75-footer, something like that, 100-foot-long boat. Big boat, right? Somebody goes overboard and they're floundering in the water. They can't swim, and you are the only one who can see them, and you can see that they can't swim, and you can't swim either. But the only thing that you can do is just jump in the water with them. That's compassion. Two swimmers who can't swim.

**Speaker B:** That is, but that's a terrible example. Like, but I guess that's true though, isn't it?

**Speaker A:** Like, yeah, I'm having a pity party, come join me in my pity party and we'll both call it compassion.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** I mean, at a high level, compassion, real Mudita, is when the guy on the boat who recognizes that his friend out there is drowning because he can't swim, and I can't swim either, said, let's use some wisdom about that and let's look for a life preserver, one of those old rings with a rope on it, and we'll throw that out there to him and let him grab hold of that thing.

**Speaker B:** Well, you said the only choice was

**Speaker A:** to jump in after him.

**Speaker B:** You said the only choice was to jump in after him.

**Speaker A:** You didn't know that's the only choice for the ignorant one, the one who was not thinking, the one who was compassionate.

**Speaker B:** I see.

**Speaker A:** But the noble is not going to jump in, right? He's going to maintain his joy. He can recognize how bad that person is suffering, but then with that compassion, he's going to use Mudita and help cheer them up. He's going to give them some Dharma, give them to laugh, get them come out of their misery party that they probably created for themselves.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** It's not that they fell overboard, they jumped, right?

**Speaker B:** No. Yeah, it sucks, but people are choosing it.

**Speaker A:** Well, we were taught to choose it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** we were young.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we don't know any different.

**Speaker A:** That's the perfect This is what Buddha is all about with ignorance, that we learn to follow orders and do the rules and take up all of that structure when we're kids who are too ignorant to figure out that, hey, wait a minute, a bunch of the stuff that they're handing us is a bunch of crap. Very, very rarely does a 3-year-old who is being taken to church day after day, Sunday after Sunday after Sunday, to the Baptist church, very rarely does a 3-year-old wake up and say, this is a bunch of crap. Yeah, it generally takes them older. Some people never wake up. Some wake up at the age of 40. Some wake up at the age of 20. Some of them wake up at 14. I've read a lot of people who wake at about 10 or 12.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I was about 6 or 7 when I said this is bull.

**Speaker A:** But before that, you bought it hook, line, and sinker. And you can recognize a whole lot of other people, they keep jumping in that, jumping out of the boat.

**Speaker B:** Now I know I bought it because I still have a lot of fear of death because of that shit, because of the Baptist, because of fire and brimstone. Like, that's a whole other thing.

**Speaker A:** Well, I tell you what, we've been going on for a while and I got somebody waiting, so we'll end this with a joke. All right, and the joke is, is that a Christian and an atheist were having an argument out on the street, and the Buddhist walks by just at the point when they're discussing hell. And the atheist says, there ain't no hell. And the Christian says, the hell there ain't. And the Buddhist, he smiles and he mentions to them both, hey guys, hell You're both in it right now.

**Speaker B:** That's great. I will use that one.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. Hell, you're both in it right now. That's what hell is. Hell is in fact not a place to go that you go to after you're dead. Is in the mind of the child, right? And it is hell. Whenever you're thinking about hell and being afraid of going there, you're in hell, right?

**Speaker B:** It exists here and now like everything

**Speaker A:** else inside the mind. It's an unwholesome thought. Well, and if you throw hell out, what have you got left?

**Speaker B:** Peace, happiness, heaven.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the real thing, not the stuff that the Christians talk about. They actually want to keep you working. That's the latest thing that I've seen now, is some preacher has said that, uh, that there's— that you'll enjoy your work in heaven because there is no government regulations.

**Speaker B:** You gotta love that level of ignorance. Like, it's astounding.

**Speaker A:** Like, it is so astounding.

**Speaker B:** Oh Lord. But, um, I gotta work in the morning, Dhammarato. It's pretty late for me here, but I very much appreciate your time. Um, and I will be in touch again. I think you told me to call twice a week, so I'll be trying to do that from now on.

**Speaker A:** Okay, we'll see you.

**Speaker B:** Bye, have a good day.

**Speaker A:** Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) in dialogue with a student (Speaker B), is a practical and de-mystifying guide to core Buddhist practice. The central theme is that meditation is not about mystical attainments over decades, but about developing a set of **practical skills to purify the mind *right now*.**

Here is a structured summary of the key points:

### **Core Philosophy: Skill Development, Not Mystical Path**
*   **The "Method" vs. The "Path":** The Eightfold Noble Path is better understood as a **method**—a set of concurrent skills to be developed now—rather than a long, sequential "path" to be walked over years.
*   **The One Job:** Whether a beginner or a 70-year practitioner, the essential task is the same: **purify the mind** by removing unwholesome thoughts and cultivating wholesome ones.
*   **Training, Not Just Meditation:** The practice is likened to **skill development** (like learning an instrument), not passive contemplation. The Pali term *bhāvanā* (development) is key.

### **The Skills of the Method (Applied through Ānāpānasati)**
Dhammarato reframes parts of the path as skills to be practiced via mindfulness of breathing:

1.  **Right View (Skill #1):** The skill of discerning between wholesome and unwholesome states, and crucially, **seeing the danger** in unwholesome states as the way to escape them.
2.  **Right Mindfulness (Sati) (Skill #2):** The skill to **wake up and remember** to apply the practice. This is developed by consciously noting "this is a long in-breath/out-breath."
3.  **Right Effort (Skill #3):** The skill of **actively changing** the mind's content:
    *   Changing unwholesome thoughts to wholesome ones.
    *   Changing shallow, tense breathing to **long, deep, relaxing breaths** that oxygenate the body and calm the mind.
4.  **Right Attitude/Thought (Skill #4):** Framed as **"Right Attitude"** (better than "Right Intention"). This is the shift from a **victim mentality** ("I have to do this") to a **"lion's" or "winner's attitude"** ("I can handle this moment; this breath is marvelous"). This attitude of self-reliance and capability is the first "noble" insight.

### **Key Practical Instructions & Insights**
*   **Breathing:** Use the breath as a primary tool. Take **long, deep, relaxing breaths** to energize the body and calm the mind. View each in-breath as a gift that sustains life.
*   **Dealing with Thoughts:** When you notice unwholesome or "junk" thoughts (typically about past/future), simply noting **"Aha, I see you, Mara"** is itself a wholesome thought that changes the mind's content. Then, consciously cultivate wholesome thoughts like "I am safe right now."
*   **Cultivating Happiness (Sukha):** We have spent a lifetime "talking ourselves into feeling bad." Now, we must **talk ourselves into feeling good** by cultivating thoughts of safety, satisfaction, and joy.
*   **Fear & Anger:** **Fear** is the root emotion; **anger** is an overcompensation for the powerlessness of fear. The goal is not to become emotionally numb, but to **become fearless by being ready to die in any moment**. If the worst (death) holds no fear, nothing else can.
*   **Jhāna Demystified:** The first *jhāna* is presented not as a trance, but as a natural state resulting from these skills: a mind **free of hindrances**, filled with **happiness (sukha)** and **joy/confidence (pīti)**, able to **apply itself (vitakka/vicāra)** and **sustain (ekaggatā)** that wholesome state.

### **Critique of Common Misunderstandings**
*   **"50 Years of Practice":** A practitioner boasting of 50 years of experience has missed the point. The goal is not accumulation of time, but **skillfulness in the present moment**.
*   **Concentration (Samādhi):** *Samādhi* is wrongly translated as "concentration," which implies exclusion and tightness. It actually means **"collection" or "unification"**—bringing the mind together into a calm, unified, and powerful whole (like the apex of a teepee).
*   **Western Buddhism:** Often adds a "scoop of *dukkha*" (suffering) by turning practice into a struggle, fostering self-judgment ("my mind wandered again"), and focusing on future attainment rather than present-moment peace.

### **The Ultimate Goal: Freedom in the Present**
*   The entire teaching points to **"thusness" (tathātā)**—being fully present in the **here and now**. This is the meaning of "Tathāgata" (the Thus-Gone One).
*   A "noble" person, through developing these skills, reaches a state of **complete sufficiency**. Because they lack nothing internally, they naturally engage in **right action, speech, and livelihood** without craving or aversion.
*   **Hell and Heaven** are not future destinations but **present-moment mind states**. Hell is the mind filled with fear and unwholesome thoughts; heaven is the peaceful, purified mind.

**In essence,** the talk is a call to stop seeking complex, long-term spiritual achievements. Instead, one should focus on the immediate, trainable skills of noticing the breath, correcting one's thoughts, cultivating a confident attitude, and thereby finding fearlessness and happiness in the only time that exists: **now**.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on your transcript, the primary speaker (Speaker A, likely a teacher named Dhammarato) uses several core metaphors and illustrative stories to explain Buddhist meditation concepts, particularly **Anapanasati** (mindfulness of breathing) and the **Noble Eightfold Path**.

Here is a breakdown of the key metaphors and stories:

### 1. Primary Metaphors

**A. The "Method" vs. "Path" Metaphor**
*   **Core Idea:** The Noble Eightfold Path is better understood as a **method** or a set of skills to be applied now, not as a long, linear road to be walked over years.
*   **The Analogy:** **Opening a door.**
    *   The method is: take the key, insert it, turn the lock, turn the knob, open. These are discrete skills that combine into a complete action. Similarly, the path factors (right view, right effort, etc.) are skills to be developed and used **in the present moment**, not sequential steps on a long trail.

**B. The "Skill Development" Metaphor**
*   **Core Idea:** Meditation is not mystical contemplation but **skill training**, like learning a practical craft.
*   **Analogies:**
    *   **Learning to read** or **playing a musical instrument.** You practice scales (fingering) to build the foundational skill for playing music. Likewise, you practice core mental skills (like Sati - remembering) to build the foundation for a calm, clear mind.
    *   **Practicing the piano.** The emphasis is on deliberate practice to build a reliable skill, not on attaining a special "meditative state."

**C. The "Samadhi as Integration" Metaphor** (Countering "Concentration")
*   **Core Idea:** *Samadhi* (often translated as concentration) is better understood as **unification, collection, or integration**, not as exclusion or narrowing focus.
*   **Analogies:**
    *   **Frozen Orange Juice Concentrate vs. Juice:** Concentration removes water (excludes). True *samadhi* is like adding the water back—it **includes** and integrates everything into a wholesome, usable whole.
    *   **Automobile Parts vs. a Functional Car:** The parts scattered are useless. When assembled into a system (the car), a new property emerges: **transportation**. The integrated mind has a new quality: peace and capability.
    *   **A Teepee or A-Frame:** The strength comes from all the poles (or elements) **coming together at a single apex**. The mind's strength comes from all its factors unifying.

**D. The "Breath as Purification & Aliveness" Metaphor**
*   **Core Idea:** Deep, conscious breathing is not just for focus; it purifies and energizes the entire system.
*   **The Analogy: Taking out the trash.**
    *   Shallow breathing leaves "stale air" (carbon dioxide/waste) in the lungs. Long, deep breathing fully expels the "trash" (CO2) and brings in fresh "oxygen," lowering the blood's acidity and making one feel "vibrantly alive." Each deep out-breath is a cleansing sigh.

**E. The "Button/Trigger/Anchor" Metaphor for Hindrances**
*   **Core Idea:** Our reactive patterns (anger, fear, restlessness) are like programmed triggers.
*   **The Analogy:**
    *   **Buttons being pushed** or **triggers being pulled** by the world or our own thoughts.
    *   **Anchors** that hold us in negative states. The practice weakens these mechanisms so that when the "button" is pushed, the circuit is dead ("nothing happens").

### 2. Key Stories & Anecdotes

**A. The Story of the 50-Year Meditator**
*   **Purpose:** To critique the misconception of meditation as a long-term accumulation of "attainments" or special states. The speaker argues that if someone is proud of 50 years of practice, they've missed the point. The core skill—purifying the mind in **this moment**—is the same for a beginner and a master.

**B. The "Criminal with a Gun" Scenario**
*   **Purpose:** To illustrate how wisdom (*right view*) and a calm mind work under threat, versus fear and panic. The "star of the movie" uses the wisdom eye to assess if the threat is real and decides wisely, while the panicked victim cannot think clearly.

**C. The "Drowning Person & Compassion" Story**
*   **Purpose:** To distinguish ignorant, sentimental compassion from wise compassion (*Mudita*).
    *   **Ignorant Compassion:** Jumping into the water to save a drowning person when you yourself can't swim. This just creates two victims.
    *   **Wise Compassion/Noble Response:** Staying calm and joyful on the boat, and **throwing a life preserver** (the Dharma, a cheerful word, practical help). True help comes from a place of stability, not from joining in the suffering.

**D. The Joke: "Hell is Right Now"**
*   **Purpose:** To concretize the Buddhist concept that heaven and hell are mental states, not future destinations.
    *   **The Setup:** An atheist and a Christian argue about the existence of hell.
    *   **The Buddhist Punchline:** "Hell? You're both in it right now." The fear, anger, and dogmatic arguing **are** the suffering of hell, created by unwholesome thoughts in the present moment.

### 3. Recurring Imagery & Framing

*   **The Lion vs. The Victim:** Used to describe **right attitude**. The lion has a "can-do," fearless, appreciative attitude ("I like this breath"). The victim feels burdened, afraid, and put-upon ("What, I have to breathe deeply *all the time*?").
*   **Talking Ourselves Into Feeling Bad/Good:** The mind is habitually engaged in internal dialogue. We've spent a lifetime "talking ourselves into feeling bad." The practice is to consciously start "talking ourselves into feeling good" with wholesome, reassuring thoughts.
*   **Anger as an Overcompensation for Fear:** A psychological story framing anger as a powerful, "delicious" feeling that masks an underlying sense of powerlessness (fear). It's a coping mechanism learned early in life.
*   **The Breath as a Reminder of Life & Death:** Each in-breath is a gift that keeps you alive. The last breath will be an out-breath ("expire"). Contemplating this brings urgency and appreciation to the present moment and leads to fearlessness.

**In summary,** the speaker systematically uses **practical, modern, and non-mystical metaphors** (keys, orange juice, car parts, piano practice) to demystify Buddhist practice. He contrasts this with what he sees as common Western misunderstandings (the path as a long trail, meditation as concentration, compassion as shared misery). The stories and jokes serve to punch home these points, making the teachings about present-moment skill development vivid and memorable.
