### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Why is it that the Western mind is that we choose to struggle when we can choose the easy way out?

**Speaker B:** That's a good question.

**Speaker A:** The answer is because we have been taught to struggle. That this is a generational tragedy, one generation of humans after another generation of humans teaches their children to be miserable. And so it's, it's good to meet you. I'm, uh, uh, I was actually raised in the Deep South myself, as you can tell from my accent. Yep. And so I, I pretty well know. I've been in— I've lived in 4 years more— more than 4 years in Oklahoma and Texas and South Carolina and North Carolina. So I know the areas pretty well.

**Speaker B:** I've lived in Texas and South Carolina myself.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so we were beginning to talk about Anapanasati and what are the key ingredients that many people miss, and that part of the reason that people miss it is partly because of the fact that Anapanasati as a practice has a formal theoretical base to it, and that formal theoretical base is called the Satipatthana, or the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. Because of that, Four Foundations of Mindfulness has typically always been earth for the body, water for the feelings, fire for the mind, and air for the mental thoughts. That sequence has been the way that the Buddha taught it, that's the way that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa normally teaches it, is taking it in that sequence. However, Bhikkhuni is also very careful to point out things that the Buddha didn't point out, so it must have been kind of common knowledge that didn't quite make it into the suttas, is that you don't practice Anapanasati the way that it's presented. That is presented in a formal manner but is to be practiced in an informal manner. And the informal manner that Anapanasati is to be practiced actually is more specified as the way that you practice the Eightfold Noble Path. So when you apply the Eightfold Noble Path to Anapanasati, the whole sequence changes around so that we look at it from the Eightfold Noble Path and most specifically The Buddha talks about the Eightfold Noble Path as right noble unification of mind with its support and features. Right unification of mind actually is the goal. Now, in the Pali, it's called Samma Arya Samatha, and in Western Buddhism, the word Samatha has been wrongly translated as concentration. But in fact, what Samadhi is, is in some cases exactly opposite to concentration. Here's what I mean by that. Concentration is automatic, is often considered closing down and getting down to the essence. Samadhi is in fact gathering together the factors that are appropriate and are needed. An example of this would be a Western Native American teepee. You know the teepee, you've probably even been in a teepee. We know that the teepee is built because it's got a number of ridge poles, at least 4, but the more the better, and that the ridge poles are at the base around the teepee. And they all merge at the top at one point where all of the teepee poles are tied together, right at the top of the teepee. That would be the Samadhi, where everything comes together. Now a lot of people would say, yeah, that means that all the poles are concentrated all in that one point. And I can say, yes, that's one way of talking about concentration. But normally we think of concentration in a different way, and that way would be: imagine frozen concentrated orange juice. Nobody drinks frozen concentrated orange juice. Why would anybody want to buy frozen concentrated orange juice? You can't drink it. You have to make it Samadhi. You can't use it as a concentrate. You've got to put the water back in it before you drink it. Right. All right. They only take the water out of it for transportation purposes, not for usage. If you understand that, then we can get a much better understanding of what the actual practice of Anapanasati is, which is more of an opening of the mind rather than a closing down or a tightening of the mind that we get an idea of when we use the word concentration. We also have words like going deep into meditation. You probably heard those kind of words before. They also talk about it in the sense that the longer you sit, the better. 2 hours is not enough, sit for 3. This is the kind of way that they look at it. This is not what the Buddha was recommending. This is not what we were practicing. And that We can get to it a little bit more, but first let's look at the Eightfold Noble Path. Right view means, or especially right noble view, means that we're doing an investigation. That in fact, he calls, he talks in the sutta, the Buddha talks about it, is the fact, the facility of investigation, the wisdom factor. The factor of inspection, investigation. Now, that's actually quite opposite of people when they think about going deep into meditation, which means you're closing a bunch of stuff off. But when we're doing an investigation, we want to investigate everything. We want to open it up. We want to take a really good, broad look at what's going on. The next one. And so this is where right view comes first. Now, later we'll talk about what is wrong view and what is ordinary right view versus what is noble right view. But let's just talk about it in the sense that normally an individual will have a viewpoint. They see things from their own personal perspective. And because of that, we're missing out on a whole lot of data, a whole lot of information. It would be better to be able to take other people's perspective and other people's points of view and put their data into the mix also. In fact, the American Indians had a phrase, walk a mile in my shoes. Mm-hmm. Okay. Now we know what that actually means. It means that if I'm actually walking a mile in this guy's shoes and I have a feeling for what his shoes feel like, and the mile probably is his mile too. So, we're talking about it in the sense of, basically we could say then that this is in Christianity, the Golden Rule that Jesus taught: Do unto others the way you want to be done to yourself. But in Buddhism, it's even more sophisticated than that, in the sense that we want to treat other people the way they want to be treated, which means now we have to investigate to find out what they like and what they want, so that we can be pleasing to them. Rather than giving them a gift that we want them to have, we give them a gift that they want to have. All right, so this is what we mean by correct investigation is one's right view. The second thing that comes along is right Sati. Normally Sati is translated as mindfulness, and because of that, it makes everything confused. That in fact the word mindfulness is kind of ridiculous anyway, because I never even heard of the word mindfulness without it being in context of Buddhism. Okay. In that case, that meant that it had no universally well-known definition outside of Buddhism, which means that when people come to Buddhism, they've got to kind of figure out what this word means. Because it doesn't have any meaning for them already. I think that this is part of the reason why Buddhism is such a mess in the West, is because of these mistranslations of some of the key words. So we've already got Samadhi correctly translated, so let's look at this idea of what Sati means. Sati actually means to remember, and we use that in a way of waking up, in the sense to wake up to be here now in this present moment. So when you wake up, first wake up in the morning, when you're in bed and you first wake up, what's the very first thing that happens is that you're aware that you're not asleep. Right, that's the wake up. We begin to wake up in the sense that we know something. This is in fact what that wake-up call is. And so the wake up, or to remember, means to remember that we're going to practice, remember to look at what's going on, to remember to apply our right view and to do a bit of investigation. Okay, we'll fit this into Anapanasati soon enough. The next one is one's right effort, and this is the key ingredient that's missing in Western meditation more than anything else. And that is, is that people are not taking the right noble effort. Most of them are either putting in the wrong effort in the sense of not enough effort like in choiceless awareness, or sometimes in the noting. And then other people work too hard at it. They strain, they struggle. I'm not getting what I want out of meditation now, let me try and struggle harder. And neither one of these things are going to be successful. And so there's a midpoint in there that is one's right effort. Now also say that the effort in the beginning is bigger because we have not been in the habit of making the effort, and so it's going to be like a new skill to be developed. But once we get the skill developed, then the effort becomes almost effortless. But in the beginning, we have to actually take the effort. The right effort. Now, what is then to be done with one's right effort? And this is the place where most of them miss. In the Mahasi Method, they do noting. You've probably heard about that, okay? The noting, though. And, and so the question is, well, what do you note? The answer is whatever occurs, right? Note whatever is there. The Buddha would say that is going to take you into a pretty dark place, a terrible place, a dark night of the soul maybe, if you practice that way. That there is another way of practice, and that other way of practice is the way of the Buddha and Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, and surprisingly enough, the way of Mahasi also. But in fact, what we have as Mahasi method in the West is not what Mahasi Sayadaw taught— the Mahasi Sayadaw that died in 1982— was much closer to Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. And he was not particularly magical. But what he did teach, in fact, that is right, is that the mind must be free from hindrances before the noting is done, which is exactly what we're talking about here, that one's right effort means that we have to remove unwholesome thoughts of the mind and put wholesome thoughts into the mind. Now we're beginning to understand that that's exactly what is in Anapanasati Sutta. Step 9 of Anapanasati is to do that investigation that we were just talking about, one's right view and Sati. Step 10 of Anapanasati is to gladden the mind, which means to take the unwholesome things out of the mind and put wholesome things in there, one wholesome thought after another after another. This is the practice of the Buddha, and that we have to actually put some skin in the game. This is an important point about one's right effort, that we actually have to— the Mahasi translations from the Burmese talk about jumping on falling on, seizing, confronting. These are the words that Maharshi uses, and he talks about it in the sense of your object of meditation. Whatever object of meditation that you have, you just don't observe it or notice it or note it. You grab hold of it, you tie it down, you sit on it, you jump on it. That's the difference. That's the problem that Mahasi Method in the West has. And you can also hear that in the sense of what they call choiceless awareness, which I think is more Vajrayana in its orientation. Okay. What does choiceless awareness mean? That means to be aware of what's going on in the mind, but don't make any choices about it. In other words, if you have all of the right intentions and you're paving your own highway to hell with your own good intentions and you wind up in hell, at least you were practicing correctly the Vajrayana. And so in fact, Vajrayana, the choiceless awareness and noting and those kind of things, will oftentimes take the student into a really, really bad state because they're not practicing according to the Buddha, according to Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, and according to the Mahasikhas, where all of them talk about that the first thing that has to be done is the removal of the hindrances, remove the mind from unwholesome thoughts and to put in wholesome thoughts. Only then can any progress be made. This is— I can give you so many suttas where this is. In Sutta number 10, when it starts into the Dhamma Nipassana, the first thing is there is the hindrances, and each hindrance is mentioned one after another. And the last statement about each of the hindrances is that this hindrance must be removed. In Sutta number 39, the Buddha gives a long exposition about the hindrances. And in there he talks about— he gives 5 analogies of what it's like to be free from the hindrances. And we'll talk about this at another time, but basically what it means is being relieved, complete relief. To be free from hindrances is like being out of jail. Being free from hindrances is like being on a long journey Anagami had been arriving home. What a relief it is to finally come home. And so the hindrances are like wandering around, having work to do, and we do that. We think up work to do, and then we tell ourselves we've got to do it. And so these are all unwholesome thoughts. And if we practice meditation without having the removal of these unwholesome thoughts, we're not going to make much practice. Or much progress. The very first thing that has to be done is the mind must be free from unwholesome states. So the first thing then that the student needs to do is to develop the skill of right view, or right Sati in the sense of making that determination about what is wholesome and what is not wholesome. What is it that's wholesome? That's something that you're going to have to figure out for yourself. We can give you some guidelines, okay? An example of that would be sort of like that we can, we can show you all this various kind of luggage but you're going to have to pack your clothes. All right, so the, uh, the whole idea is, is that, um, the kind of thoughts that humans can have is vast, but most of them are unwholesome. The kind of thoughts that a human can have that are completely and totally wholesome are very few. It's almost like the same thing as the number of lies, or the number of things that you can say that is false, is vast as compared to the number of things that you can say which is absolutely true. The example that I always give is, uh, for the student, is how old are you? How old are you?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, 47.

**Speaker A:** All right, now lie to me. How old are you?

**Speaker B:** 43.

**Speaker A:** Now lie to me again. How old are you?

**Speaker B:** 27.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so how about 300? How about 9,000? You can say anything if it's a lie. I'm minus 23. Okay, okay, we can say anything that's a lie, but the truth is very small. Just one of those numbers is true, all the rest of them are false. This is so remarkable when we say, "Okay, well, what we mean is that we have to start doing kind of a search, a treasure hunt," because the treasure is small among all the vast belief systems and lies and hindrances and all that kind of stuff, all the unwholesome is vast compared to the wholesome, which is very small. And as we progress in meditation, we begin to see that what we used to think was wholesome, now we begin to discern is that's not so wholesome after all. It's got some dangers in it. Now, the Buddha was very big on the idea that the reason that we do the things that we do is because we did get, or expecting to get, gratification from doing it. That we do things for gratification, we seek sensual pleasures, we do things like pick our nose. When we pick our nose because we expect some value out of it, okay? But it's not so easy to see the danger. Once we see the danger, then we can plot the escape. But until we see the danger, all we can see is the gratification. This is why we get stuck in doing things that are harmful, is because we only see the gratification and we can't see the danger. So as we develop in our right view, that means that our discernment about figuring out what is wholesome, what is dangerous, etc., like that, is a skill to be developed over time. But we do know that we can start off with a few things that we can automatically see are unwholesome. And even though that we know that they're unwholesome, there'll be some times when it's necessary to do that in order to prevent something else unwholesome. An example of that would be that here in Thailand, I'm going to have to do the visa on a regular basis. And so I need to do a bit of planning so that that goes off without a hitch. But it doesn't take much planning, and yet some people just burn and toil and mangle and whatever like that about those visas. A lot of work. All right, exactly the same thing happens with the IRS at tax time. Pay federal income taxes. Some people struggle with that tax return, and others, it's just a piece of cake, nothing to it. All right, that's a mental attitude. Which is the superior attitude? The one who works and presses and messes and is concerned with his tax return, or the one who thinks it's a piece of cake? In that regard, wouldn't it be better then for people who struggle and mess and toil with their life and redo and try to cheat here and there and wonder if they're going to get caught and all that kind of stuff, or someone who lives his life, "Life's a piece of cake, easy enough." Why is it that the Western mind is that we choose to struggle? When we can choose the easy way out?

**Speaker B:** That's a good question.

**Speaker A:** The answer is, is because we have been taught to struggle. That this is a generational tragedy. One generation of humans after another generation of humans teaches their children to be miserable. It is all learned behavior, one generation after another. And so we pick up the bad habits of our parents, and then we give— pass those bad habits on to our children. And this is well known by the psychologists. This is not something that's new. An example of that is, is that in families that have domestic violence, The children who were raised in a household that had domestic violence are more than likely going to be living in a household when they're adults that has domestic violence, but they're going to be, in the new case, the ones who were doing the violence. Mm-hmm. Okay, so this is the way that we begin to understand that much of our unwholesome behavior we learned as children when we were really ignorant. We piled on all of that stuff, and everybody that we heard, especially if we were in danger— because when a child is in danger, which means the self-preservation instinct is going on, that means he's going to remember that event. He's going to remember the really dangerous events much more likely than he's going to remember all of the the good events. An example of that is when I was in high school, when I first started riding motorbikes, I had several motorbike accidents. I remember those bike accidents, but I don't remember so much the exhilaration of riding around town all day. We remember our tragedies. Okay, so now we've got a whole long list of tragedies that we use as a past for us to use as a base for remembering. If we've got a bunch of garbage, then we're going to remember a bunch of garbage. We're going to have a bunch of garbage in the thoughts and in the mind. We're going to have garbage feelings associated with them. Those are all unwholesome. And so the whole teaching of the Buddha is that we need to remove these unwholesome thoughts by practice. You have to practice to sit there and to watch the mind and to recognize that any thought that comes up has to be judged. Is this thought worth having or not? And if it's not worth having, then we can throw it out and put something in there that is worth having. This is the practice of Anapanasati over and over and over again, and that's why And if you noticed, I haven't told you anything about formal meditation practice. That we're talking about actually to remember to wake up, to look at what's in the mind, and if it's unwholesome, to throw it out and put something wholesome in the mind. You can do that driving your car, walking down the street, you can do that riding the bus. You do this at any point in time. All you have to do is remember— that's Sati— to wake up and to look at what you're doing. Well, most people, when they're out in the world, uh, the world is too much for them. And so what the Buddha recommends is to get ourselves into seclusion, to get away from the world. And when we get away from the world, what we find out is we brought the world with us anyway. And so now that world, we have to start evaluating and throwing those thoughts out and start having wholesome thoughts. And so your practice is to begin to recognize for yourself, is this wholesome? Is this thought wholesome? Now there's an actual added ingredient into that, but this is one's right effort. The Buddha talks about that one's right effort is to change the attitude or to change the excuse me, to change the view from wrong view to right view. And one's right effort is also to change our thought from one unwholesome thought to a wholesome thought. This is the practice that we're starting now. The important point here is that the Buddha also in the Anapanasati Sutra recommends a particular kind of wholesome thought. And that is a thought that gladdens the mind, brightens the mind, brings the mind up. And in several of the books that have been attributed to the various lectures that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa has given, one of my favorites—I got it pegged—is way into page 217 in this book on Anapanasati. Where Bhikkhu Buddhadasa makes the statement, this is the first thing that you should be doing. That's the problem with books. If you have a book that's organized with an introduction and whatnot like that, it's waiting until 200 pages in to tell you this is the first thing that you have to do. But that's how the book is written. So I can give you that in our first talk. The very first thing that we have to do is to learn to gladden the mind. To take the mind out of unwholesome states into wholesome states. And so we could say that, all right, if we're going to do noting, then the noting has to be an active skin-in-the-game noting, in the sense that if you're going to note what's in the mind, then as soon as you find out that what's in the mind is not wholesome, you throw it out and you put something in the mind that is wholesome. And a lot of people say, well, I can't throw thoughts out of the mind. But they don't recognize that when they just said that, then they had just thrown out whatever thought they were having so that they could put that thought in. That the mind is like that, that it's almost like a conveyor belt, and whatever is in front of you on that conveyor belt, that's what's in the mind right now. But as soon as that conveyor belt moves, you've got a new mind moment, and you could put into the mind anything that you want to. The Buddha had a a phrase that he used that he got started from the very beginning when he was under the Bodhi tree, when he was beginning to put together Paticcasamuppada and the Eightfold Noble Path and all of that. There is a key ingredient, a key point about this that he came up with, and that key is, "Aha, I see you, Mara." Well, that "aha, I see you, Mara," that's Sati, to wake up; number 2, to take a look; number 3, to investigate to the point of recognizing with discernment that this thought is unwholesome; and then the next thought that comes in is the gladdening of the mind, "aha, I see you!" "Aha, I caught you!" "Aha, I see you, Mara!" And so we have just now changed the mind out of the unwholesome thought of Mara into the wholesome thought of Arahant. Also in that regard, when people are having thoughts, random thoughts, the general idea is that this is my thought and I am the thought, and we attach to our thoughts as if our thoughts were worthwhile or useful or whatever like that, without recognizing that almost all the thoughts that we do have were learned from someone else. Generally from our parents. And so the kind of thoughts that we have, we attach to as if they're my thoughts, to in fact, no, it's just a thought. It's just a thought. But when it's my thought, it's like grasping or clinging to that thought. And when we wake up, the wake-up is, aha, I see you, Mara. Normally we live our lives like this, in suffering, in it. This is my thought, my thought is taking me, and whatever way that thought goes, I feel that way. I'm in it, I'm stuck. But the wake-up is to— aha, I see you, Mara. By doing that, we actually separate. I am no longer that thought. So I can have a thought about how miserable it is because I don't have my Winky Wonky. And then I can wake up and say, aha, I see that, and I don't need that winky wonky right now anyway. And so this is the wake-up, this is the gladdening of the mind. This is one of the key ingredients to Anapanasati that is also missing in the Mahasi Method with the noting, is because, or how bad it is, that's what they're noting. Here we're only noting it enough to where we can say, ah, you've got to change that. You've got to come out of the unwholesome and bring it into the wholesome, so that you can begin to have one wholesome thought after another wholesome thought after another wholesome thought after another wholesome thought. Now, these kind of wholesome thoughts that we're talking about, of the gladdening of the mind, can actually begin to spark us up and make us feel better if they are real, as opposed to what we call affirmations. You've probably heard of affirmations. I mean, libraries book— libraries full of books have been written on affirmations. And people will buy these self-help books and they'll read it, and while they're reading the book, they feel really good. But when they put the book back on the shelf, they forget all about it. Or the teenage girl will stand in the mirror in the morning and, uh, looking in the mirror and telling herself, oh, you're the— you're the prom queen, or you're the most beautiful girl in town, and all of this kind of stuff, giving herself those affirmations. Deep down inside she doesn't believe it. And so they're not really going to be of any value when she gets to school. When she gets to school, she'll be going to be back into the same old mentality because those affirmations she gave herself while looking in the mirror didn't stick because they weren't real. Here we're talking about doing something that's absolutely real in reality Because it is reality and we know that this is real, we can get great benefit from it by changing the mind from unwholesome into wholesome thoughts. And the kind of wholesome thoughts that we're going to have are the wholesome thoughts that make us feel good. So we would have thoughts like, as an example, wow, this feels good. Aha, I'm glad I don't have to think about that anymore. Whatever the Mara was. So if I'm thinking about, I got to go to work and, and I've got to do this, that, and the other, I got to make this report, and then I'm sitting and I'm saying, wait a minute, I'm not at work, I'm not, I don't have any reports right now, why am I thinking about a report? Out! Get out of the mind, Mr. Report. And then I can say, wow, I don't have to think about that right now, what a relief that is. And so we start thinking about it in the sense of having relief, having comfortableness. We're actually going to work with words that have to do with feeling safe and secure, because when we're in an ordinary state of mind, we have thoughts that wind up being fearful thoughts. And so we're going to now have intentional thoughts that are fearless thoughts. An example of that is there's no alligators in the room, there's no crocodiles, there's no boas, there's no pythons, there's no rattlesnakes. The SWAT team is not busting down your door. You don't have any mafia bosses in your bedroom. You see what I'm talking about? Everything is safe. You can go through what are the things that are dangerous for you, and you can recognize they're not here now. And because they're not here, there's no reason to be unsafe. And so we actually talk ourselves into the reality that this is a safe place in this moment, in this time, and we begin to feel safe. We also begin to say things like, "This is good, this is nice, this is good enough, I don't need anything new." So we become comfortable, and also we become satisfied. In fact, this whole point about satisfaction is remarkable, because we spend our whole lives being dissatisfied. This is actually possibly the very best definition of the word Dukkha. Dukkha does not necessarily mean suffering, it means just being dissatisfied. So we're going to actually practice putting ourselves into a state of being satisfied, which is basically Third Noble Truth: got no suffering. I'm not dissatisfied with anything, I'm completely satisfied with everything. And so we begin to work with this, begin to say, uh, I'm comfortable, I'm secure, I'm satisfied, I'm safe, and everything is all right, and I've got no worries, no place to go, and nothing to do. The spring comes, the grass grows by itself. So we get ourselves in this state of Everything is okay, everything is fine. Tell yourself a few jokes. Enjoy your life. Taking a deep breath, and in fact, this is the second part of one's right effort that is generally missed in the Western Mahasi method, but Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and the Buddha and Mahasi all make a big point of it, is that the breath is not just to be watched. Is to be grabbed hold of, is to be seized. Just like we're seizing control of the mind, we're also seizing control of the breath, and we do that with the mind. What this means is that we're going to take— when we remember, when Sati comes up, we're going to take a long deep in-breath. In fact, we want Sati on a deep in-breath, a long in-breath, and Sati on a long out-breath. One breath in, Sati. One long out-breath, Sati. One long in-breath, Sati. One long out-breath, Sati. We begin to train like this so that we can remember using the breath to be here now, to be in the present moment, to not let the mind wander away, but to stay focused, to stay. And I use the word focus, and many people will think, ah, you're talking about concentration again. No, actually we're talking about it in the sense of being in the present moment is quite large to become in the senses. But most people spend their time in that sixth sense of the mind, chattering, talking, talking, talking. And what we're looking at doing is to stop talking to ourselves so much, especially in the sense of work to do, the past, the future, restlessness, and all of those kind of thoughts that we normally have, and kind— and start having the kind of thoughts that are about this present moment. Like, this is a good breath. Wow, I like this one. And just be in the present moment and start to enjoy remembering to take a long deep breath. Remembering to take a long deep out-breath, remembering to throw out unwholesome thoughts, and remember to put in wholesome thoughts. This is the basic practice of Anapanasati. And so this is all there really is to it. Now we can put it in into some context and whatnot like that, but we can talk about it in the sense of what people in the West refer to as formal sitting practice. We could use the word formal sitting practice in the way that is useful, in the sense of making sure that we're away from the world in seclusion. So we go to a secluded spot, but the secluded spot could be off in the woods, could be in an empty hut,— does not have to be in a meditation hall. But we do want to make sure that we're away from everything so that we can practice quietly. And what we're going to practice is to watch these thoughts and remove unwholesome thoughts— thoughts about the past, thoughts about the future, thoughts about someplace else— and start having thoughts about what is happening right here, right now, especially the very best things that are happening right here. Right now. Like, wow, this is nice. Everything is okay. No problems. And we want to continue working with those kind of thoughts until we can begin to control the mind. Control the mind to control the breathing so that you can have the kind of thoughts that you want to have. And this will take a little while, but it's worth practicing. So we're actually developing skills. All of these parts of the Eightfold Noble Path are skills to be developed. One's right effort is a skill to be developed. One's right Sati is the major skill to be developed. One's right view is to be developed. And when we keep doing this, there's something new that will happen, and that is that we can see, yes, I can do this. Yes, I can clean out the mind. Yes, I can throw out the past. Yes, I can get myself into a really nice state. And then that's when confidence starts to grow. And pretty soon the confidence grows to the point of saying, yes, I can do this. Then when it grows really strong, we can say, no matter what happens with the mind, it doesn't matter how obstructed or what happens, I can get myself back into a really good state I can feel good. I can be here now. I can see the way things really are. This is real confidence. This is actually in the Eightfold Noble Path, Samma Sanghappa, which is translated as one right thought, but it's actually more than that. It's more like an attitude, the attitude of can-do, the attitude I can do this. And so this is the actual right way of practicing Anapanasati, is to gladden the mind, to take unwholesome thoughts out and to put wholesome thoughts in, to let the breathing become long and deep and slow, and having thoughts of no place to go, nothing to do, no work to do, nothing future, 'Just this present moment is just great. Isn't this nice? Isn't this nice? Isn't this great?' That's the kind of language we want to start having so that we talk ourselves literally with reality into feeling marvelous. Now, how marvelous I feel! Don't you feel marvelous right now? Okay, that's the whole point, is let yourself feel really good. Let yourself feel really marvelous. Let yourself feel really successful. This is what we mean by the lion's attitude. The lion— Buddha was a lion. That's the confidence of the Samma Sanghappa, right attitude. So you can develop that. Now one of the things that we can talk about is, is that how often do you practice it, where do you do it, and all of that kind of stuff. And I would recommend, you see, in most meditation systems they have the idea that sitting for a long period of time is of some value. But a way of looking at it is to say that you could sit for an hour That means that every day you sit for an hour, that's 23 hours of hindrance, and maybe one hour that's only partial hindrance. So we're not looking at any formal sitting practice to do anything other than getting us in the habit of doing something that we can then take out all day long. And for that reason, I would prefer to see students practicing 5 or 6 times a day for 10 minutes, 6 times a day, or maybe even if you're really good at it, uh, for 6 minutes 10 times a day, rather than for 60 minutes in a row. Why? Because the mind's going to get tired. Uh, people talk about going in deep into meditation. We're not trying to go deep into meditation. We're brightening the mind, we're getting gladdened, we're being in the senses, and we're here now. We're becoming awake. In many cases, you could see that what is normally referred to in Western systems of meditation is not waking up, it's going to sleep in a way. It's going deep into meditation, and many times it's just deep into thought and deep into unhappiness. Because they're just— they're not cleaning out the mind, they're not finishing the hindrances. And so the first job that we have to do is to get the mind free from the hindrances, to get out of the unwholesome and have wholesome thoughts. Only then can we make any progress. So that's what I would recommend, to practice a few times a day rather than prolonged settings. In fact, possibly the longest time to sit would be 20 minutes. The human attention span doesn't last longer than about 20 minutes for most of us, and so practicing for about 20 minutes would be enough. But the most important thing is to get yourself into a really good state. If you're in a really, really good state, then it doesn't matter how long you're practicing so long as you're in a really good state. When you come out of a good state, then there's no reason to practice anymore if you're not going to be in a good state. So getting yourself into a good state, that's the important thing— getting the mind wholesome. After that, we can talk about, well, what do we do then? The answer to that is, once we get the mind completely wholesome, then the noting that we're going to be doing is going to be only noting wholesome things. Okay. Yeah, that's amazing, isn't it? As opposed to just noting, and then we got to note all kinds of crap. But when we have the only wholesome thoughts in the mind, now what we're noting is going to be all

**Speaker B:** wholesome. Makes much more sense.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's what the Buddha taught. That's what Mahasyi taught. That's what Goenka taught. But that's not what's happening in Western Buddhism. No, not at all, because they don't have that most important ingredient of removal of the hindrances. And making the mind completely wholesome. So do you think you got somewhere to go now? You got a method of practice that you can start with? I do.

**Speaker B:** Everything you said makes perfect sense. My general, before tonight, was I would usually— my daily practice was when I get up first thing in the morning, I would sit for 30 minutes. And then when I got home from work, before I would start my studies, I would sit for 30 minutes. The afternoon sit was generally more— I was constantly dozing off. I was trying to stay awake, but I was constantly dozing off. And so I finally just got tired of doing that. I would just try to make it lower a little bit, like maybe 15 minutes.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, we can talk about that dosing too, because you can see that number one, when the mind gets tired, it's going to go to sleep. And one of the ways that it gets tired is because we're not breathing well. If you start breathing well and taking long, deep in-breaths and long, deep out-breaths, you're going to energize the body. It's not going to be so sleepy.

**Speaker B:** Okay, when you say long, is that like doing it, letting it go naturally, or trying to start off doing it long and then letting it go naturally?

**Speaker A:** We want to— the answer to that is we're going to actually control the breath. We want to do— we're going to develop two skills at the same time. One is the skill of Sati, and the other is the skill of breathing

**Speaker B:** well.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so we're going to remember to breathe well. Now, what do we mean by breathing well? Well, one of the ways, one of the qualities of breathing well is that we become relaxed. That part of Anapanasati is the relaxation of the body as well as waking up the body. And so if you are taking deep breaths, then that helps relax the body. Because it's throwing out the poisons of the carbon dioxide and all the other stuff on the out-breath, as well as taking the deep in-breath and getting a lot of oxygen. But with the Mahasi Method and the other practices of meditation, because they don't emphasize seizing and taking control of the breath and having mindfulness of each breath, they just say, just watch the breath. And if the mind wanders away, come back and start watching the breath again, which means they've got no skin in the game. So if you use the analogy of a big sports arena, like a football team— I think in Tennessee there's a lot of people who like football, Tennessee Vols and all of that. Oh yeah. All right. There's two kinds of people in there. There are those who are spectating, watching the action on the play, and then there are the

**Speaker B:** players.

**Speaker A:** Who is more likely going to have his eye on the ball, the spectators or the players?

**Speaker B:** Generally, I would say the players.

**Speaker A:** All right. If someone is going to make a touchdown, who's going to make the touchdown, the players or the spectators? Player. All right, but why are the spectators in when the touchdown is made? Why are they jumping up and down and screaming and cheering? The answer is, well, that's why they came to the football game, was to feel good. And so they want that guy to make it. But while he's just running around the field, they're probably not paying much attention to the ball.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and they always say, 'We scored,' when the team scored.

**Speaker A:** Right, when the team scores. And they almost think about it as my football team. They do. My team, right? If he goes to the— at the end of the game, if he goes into the locker room and says, hey guys, you did a great job, my team won, they're going to throw him out of there. They don't know him. Yeah, not to them. He doesn't own that team. He only thinks so in his own mind. Mm-hmm. That's an unwholesome thought— my team— because it's wrong. It's not real. He does not own that team. It is not his. And yet almost everyone in the fan of the, uh, in that stadium will have those thoughts for one team or the other. This is my team, that's not my team. But the reality is, is that that team doesn't belong to anybody, especially not to the owner of the team. No, doesn't belong to him either. It is all delusion about this ownership.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I love watching football, but I've never understood the whole concept of like, um, I used to go to, um, back when I used to drink, I would go to sports bars and watch games. And sometimes, you know, I have to get up, go to the bathroom, go get something. I come back, I hear a bunch of yelling.

**Speaker A:** What happened?

**Speaker B:** Oh, we just scored. I would always think, who is this we you're talking about? You didn't do anything. You just sat there and watched it. The individual is the one who just scored. But, you know, some people, they really get into it.

**Speaker A:** All right. So now that we've really thoroughly investigated this analogy, we can recognize that a lot of people who are practicing meditation do it like spectators.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay.

**Speaker A:** And we need to actually practice it like we're the team, like we're on the playing field. You have to actually take control of your breath. This is not a spectator sport. This is— you got to put some skin in the game. This is one's right effort.

**Speaker B:** Okay, that makes perfect sense now.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Okay, so this is where we're going with this. You can see also an example is, is that somebody's playing a video game, you're just watching it over their shoulder. It's a little bit entertaining, but anything will drag you away from it. But if you're playing that game yourself, mom can come up and yell in your ear and you're not going to pay any attention because you're in that game. You've got it. Absolutely. That's the kind of practice that we're trying to put into, is we're trying to put some skin in the game. Got to take control of the mind, got to take control of the breath. And this is the kind of teaching that is not taught. And I think that in Asia, it doesn't have to be taught because anybody would just kind of understand that. But in the West, we've got this whole spectator sport mentality. They do. And so the important point for you to understand is that this is your meditation. You're the one who's got to do that. You've got to take control of your breath. You've got to take control of your mind. You're the one who has to monitor the mind to make sure only wholesome thoughts come in. And as you keep doing that, you'll get really developed in the skill so that you'll know more and more what's a wholesome thought and what's not wholesome. And so this is the way to get started. All right, all right.

**Speaker B:** So I guess rule of thumb for just starting tomorrow morning when I wake up, just instead of spending 30 minutes straight, do 10 minutes here, 10 minutes there, but not trying to just do

**Speaker A:** it all at once. Exactly, not doing it all at once. But, but the other point is, is that, but you don't have to wait until tomorrow morning. You can take that deep breath right now.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that's true.

**Speaker A:** And as soon as we finish the conversation, you can go get a cup of coffee. And while you're getting that coffee, while you're pouring out the water, you can take that deep breath and say, my, isn't this marvelous? So we want to start putting the practice throughout the day. We want to remember to do this, and we'll talk about it a little bit later, but the important point about Sati is that Sati is a skill that we need at certain periods of time in our life. There will be crises, little and big, where we need to wake up. We need to know what's going on, but we're lost in thought instead. So we need to practice Sati so that we can practice it to get it when we need it the most, like when the boss is coming down the hall or when the cop is flashing his red lights behind us on the highway. Times like that, okay? When we need it most, that's when people lose it. Oh, exactly. Okay, so this is why we're going to practice often and practice in a way to remember this breath and remember that, so that we can have our wholesome thought processing going just at the time when we need it most. An example is when the cop is stopping you out on the highway, you better not be afraid of him. You better be able to meet him in a friendly and happy manner. If you're freaked out, he'll freak out, and the next thing you know, you might be dead. Yeah, absolutely. This is why Sati is so valuable, so important, and such an indefinite skill to be developed. That is, every breath has to be an intentionally long, deep breath. Every out-breath has to be intentionally a long, deep out-breath, every one that you can remember. This will help develop that Sati. Okay. Okay, I'm glad that you called. I hope to see you again soon.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I look forward to it.

**Speaker A:** Many more. All right. Okay, well, uh, once or twice a week will be good.

**Speaker B:** Okay. And like I said earlier, Fridays are generally the best time because that's when I'm off the weekends, and that's when I'm got plenty of time.

**Speaker A:** That would be great.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, I look forward to it.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, we'll finish this call now and we'll see you soon.

**Speaker B:** All right, I will see you soon.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a Sangha friend (Speaker B), focuses on correcting common misunderstandings in Western meditation practice, particularly regarding **Anapanasati** (mindfulness of breathing). Here is a concise summary of the key points:

### **Core Problem: Western Misinterpretation**
- Western meditation often promotes **struggle, striving, and "deep concentration,"** which contradicts the Buddha's path of ease and gladdening the mind.
- This stems from cultural conditioning ("generational tragedy") and key translation errors (e.g., *samadhi* as "concentration" rather than "unification" or "gathering").

### **Correct Framework: The Eightfold Path & Anapanasati**
- True Anapanasati should be practiced **informally**, aligned with the **Eightfold Noble Path**, not as a rigid formal exercise.
- The sequence is reshuffled: start with **Right View** (investigation), then **Right Mindfulness (Sati)**—which means **"to remember" or "wake up"**—and **Right Effort**.

### **Critical Missing Ingredient: Right Effort**
- Western methods often lack **Right Effort**: either too passive ("choiceless awareness," "noting") or too strained.
- **Correct effort is active**: you must **"put skin in the game"**—like a player, not a spectator—by **seizing control of the mind and breath**.
- **First and foremost**: remove unwholesome thoughts (hindrances) and **actively gladden the mind** with wholesome thoughts (e.g., safety, satisfaction, relief). This is Step 10 of Anapanasati.

### **Practical Method: Gladden the Mind & Control the Breath**
1.  **Wake Up (Sati)**: Remember to be present. Use the phrase **"Aha, I see you, Mara"** to recognize and detach from unwholesome thoughts.
2.  **Cleanse the Mind**: Judge each thought. If unwholesome (fearful, restless, about past/future), discard it. Replace it with a **real, believable wholesome thought** that brings gladness, safety, and satisfaction (e.g., "I am safe here," "This is enough," "No worries").
3.  **Master the Breath**: Don't just watch the breath. **Actively take long, deep, controlled in-breaths and out-breaths** to energize the body, relax, and anchor Sati.
4.  **Practice Format**: Short, frequent sessions (e.g., 6-10 minutes, many times daily) are better than one long, tiresome sit. The goal is to **cultivate a wholesome state** you can maintain throughout the day.
5.  **Develop Confidence**: As you succeed in gladdening the mind, you build **real confidence (Samma Sankappa)** that you can find peace regardless of circumstances.

### **Critique of Common Western Methods**
- **Mahasi "Noting"** (as often taught in the West) and **Choiceless Awareness** are criticized for noting *everything* without first removing hindrances, leading to potential distress.
- True Mahasi (and Goenka) teachings, like the Buddha's and Buddhadasa's, **first require purifying the mind** of unwholesome states.

### **Key Analogy: Player vs. Spectator**
- Most meditate like a **spectator at a game**—passively watching.
- You must be the **player**—actively engaged, taking control, with "skin in the game." Meditation is not a passive observation but an active cultivation.

### **Ultimate Goal**
- To develop the skill of maintaining a **bright, glad, unhindered mind** filled with wholesome thoughts, leading to true awakening and the end of dissatisfaction (*dukkha*).

In essence, the talk is a call to shift from a **culture of struggle** to a **practice of joyful ease**, by actively gladdening the mind and taking charge of one's meditation with right understanding and effort.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by Speaker A to explain meditation concepts and common misunderstandings:

### **Metaphors**

1. **The Teepee (for Samadhi)**
   - **Metaphor**: The ridge poles of a teepee all come together and are tied at the top.
   - **Purpose**: To explain *Samadhi* not as narrow "concentration" but as a gathering and unification of all necessary factors into one harmonious point.

2. **Frozen Orange Juice Concentrate (for Samadhi)**
   - **Metaphor**: You don’t drink frozen concentrate; you must add water back to make it usable.
   - **Purpose**: To argue that *Samadhi* is not a condensed, exclusionary state but an "opening up" and integrating of the mind—it requires all elements present to be functional.

3. **Conveyor Belt (for the Mind)**
   - **Metaphor**: The mind is like a conveyor belt; each moment presents a new "item" (thought), and you can choose what to place on it next.
   - **Purpose**: To illustrate that thoughts are transient and we can actively replace an unwholesome thought with a wholesome one in the next moment.

4. **Spectator vs. Player in a Football Game (for Meditation Effort)**
   - **Metaphor**: Most meditators are like spectators watching a game, but real practice requires being a player on the field with "skin in the game."
   - **Purpose**: To emphasize that meditation requires active, effortful engagement—taking control of the breath and mind—not passive observation.

5. **Treasure Hunt (for Wholesome Thoughts)**
   - **Metaphor**: Wholesome thoughts are like a small treasure hidden among a vast field of unwholesome thoughts (lies and hindrances).
   - **Purpose**: To show that finding and cultivating wholesome thoughts requires diligent searching and discernment, as they are rare compared to the countless unwholesome options.

6. **Packing Your Own Luggage (for Personal Practice)**
   - **Metaphor**: A teacher can show you luggage (guidelines), but you must pack your own clothes (choose your own wholesome thoughts).
   - **Purpose**: To stress that while guidance is given, the meditator must personally discern and cultivate what is wholesome for them.

7. **Walking a Mile in Someone’s Shoes (for Right View)**
   - **Metaphor**: To understand another’s perspective fully by experiencing their reality.
   - **Purpose**: To explain *right view* as incorporating others’ perspectives, not just one’s own—leading to treating others as *they* wish to be treated.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1. **Generational Teaching of Struggle**
   - **Story**: Each generation teaches the next to struggle and be miserable, like families passing down patterns of domestic violence.
   - **Purpose**: To explain why Westerners often choose struggle over ease in meditation and life—it’s a learned behavior.

2. **"Aha, I See You, Mara!"**
   - **Story**: The Buddha’s moment under the Bodhi tree, recognizing the tempter Mara.
   - **Purpose**: To frame *Sati* (mindfulness) as a "wake-up call"—a moment of recognizing unwholesome thoughts (Mara) and actively replacing them with wholesome ones.

3. **The Teenage Girl and Affirmations**
   - **Anecdote**: A girl tells herself she’s beautiful in the mirror but doesn’t truly believe it, so the affirmation doesn’t help at school.
   - **Purpose**: To contrast empty positive affirmations with the genuine, reality-based cultivation of wholesome thoughts in meditation.

4. **Tax Return & Visa Stress**
   - **Anecdote**: Some people struggle endlessly with taxes or visa paperwork, while others handle it with ease.
   - **Purpose**: To illustrate how mental attitude determines whether an experience is a struggle or "a piece of cake"—and to encourage choosing the easy, skillful approach.

5. **Motorbike Accidents in High School**
   - **Personal Story**: Speaker A remembers motorbike accidents vividly but not the everyday joy of riding.
   - **Purpose**: To show how the mind naturally holds onto traumatic or negative memories, which then form the basis for unwholesome thought patterns.

6. **Sports Fan Ownership Delusion**
   - **Story**: A fan says "we scored" and feels ownership of a team, but the players don’t know him.
   - **Purpose**: To highlight how attachment to thoughts (like "my team") is delusional and unwholesome—the thought isn’t truly "ours" or real.

These metaphors and stories collectively serve to:
- Correct perceived mistranslations and misunderstandings in Western Buddhism (e.g., *Samadhi*, *Sati*).
- Emphasize **active, effortful engagement** over passive observation.
- Illustrate the **replacement of unwholesome with wholesome thoughts** as the core of meditation.
- Ground abstract Buddhist concepts in **relatable, everyday imagery**.
