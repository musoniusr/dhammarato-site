### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, so we've had a couple of minutes to talk and now you've got a question, so let me hold it.

**Speaker B:** Oh, hopefully this is the right sort of question.

**Speaker A:** I mean, probably it is, probably it is irrelevant as all the other questions.

**Speaker B:** Well, it's that, you know, in the suttas, like, there's a lot of You know, when the Buddha's followers die, he always says where they were reborn. You know, he often like gives this detail if he travels to a place. You know, they receive him there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, everybody loves the story. Why do you have to believe the story instead of getting the point of the story? There's many situations like that. Okay, um, Aesop's Fables. Have you ever heard of Aesop's Fables?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I've heard of them.

**Speaker A:** All right, so one example is the tortoise and the hare have a race, then the rabbit goes to sleep along the way, and then the tortoise wins the race. And there's a teaching in there, right? All right, don't go to sleep on the job would be one of it. Another one would be slow and steady Another one is don't brag, do. You know, there's a lot of different morals that we can have for the story. But do you really believe because I told you a story that rabbits and, and, uh, tortoises have races for any reason? Okay, so why do you believe in all of the other stuff and say, oh, is it real or not, when in fact there's a point to it? You don't have to believe the story. I'll give you another example. I got a whole bunch of examples, but my favorite is Adam and Eve. And the story is all about talking snakes, and the woman did it first, and apples, and getting the boot out of a garden.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's an interesting one.

**Speaker A:** Because they ate the wrong fruit. Fruit, like it was an apple or something. Okay, and then we have all traditions about poison apples and this, that, and the other thing, without understanding that the fruit is the fruit of knowledge of good and evil. In other words, we have to put up the results of our judgments. That simple Kamma, cause and effect. If you judge something to be bad, in your Paradise, you begin to destroy your Paradise one item at a time. But that's the real story, is judgments come out of our judgmental attitude. But look what the religious folks have done with that simple teaching— magical snakes and first man and Paradise Lost and all kinds of crazy stuff that comes into a religion when there's a simple teaching in there. Yeah, let's accept paradise the way it is. Stop trying to fix it because it's broken.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I guess, um, Then is it a case of the Buddha was— had he had, uh, you know, a cultural context, what everybody believed about rebirth, and he taught within that, you know, as a tool?

**Speaker A:** Not necessarily, and it depends upon the change of the language. And Westerners don't understand the nuances and the details of the Pali They just listened to the translators, who may or may not have known the Dhamma. Let me tell you a little story in the sense that the CIA sold some documents from the Germans during the war, and got information about nuclear physics. Did they take those German science research papers to a 10th-grade German class in the United States to get it translated? Uh, yeah, yeah. Okay, so that's the problem with translators is one, they're trying to learn the language they're translating out of.

**Speaker B:** And there's a language not many people really even speak anymore. Oh, I mean, you know, the— I.

**Speaker A:** Guess the most— it's the basis of any Indo-European. In fact, that's why it's really so easy to pick up on Pali is because it's the language that we speak now. It's just gotten old and crusty.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And the crustiness is all the beliefs that people have piled on because they really didn't understand the word itself. But you go back down to the word, it's part of our Indo-European heritage. And, and it's a very interesting thing to do. I congratulate you on becoming interested in following, right, so that you can actually see that oftentimes the word rebirth pops up in suttas to where actually the word jati is used. And the word jati doesn't necessarily mean even that kind of birth. The jati has the beginning. And so you've heard of the birth of the blues? You think that that music popped out of a saxophone fully grown as a human, the birth of the blues? No! It's a metaphor already, okay? And so that's the whole point, is the beginning of things. We can also use the word birth in the sense of a resting place or a sleeping place, for gestation and getting better. So it's kind of like a hospital bed also. It's our birth, it's our beginning, it's our start. Doesn't have to be with this magical belief. That's based in reincarnation. Okay, in fact, here's a trick question for you. Do you know the difference between rebirth and reincarnation? What's the difference?

**Speaker B:** I've got an idea. I remember, you know, when I was very young and I read in Walpola Rahula's book, he said it's like rebirth is like a candle flame, you know, being passed from one candle to another.

**Speaker A:** Whereas reincarnation is like a candle or the flame.

**Speaker B:** I suppose, uh, the flame. The flame.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, if you're the flame, was the flame that's on the candle that's burning now the same flame as it was a tenth of a second ago, or is that flame gone?

**Speaker B:** Well, no, I suppose it's a process.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right. Okay, so if you're the flame, guess what? You've been in and out a whole long— it doesn't matter how many candles have been going by. You're gone. There's no you there, merely process or flow. And there's no you in it. Reincarnation is me. I am the flame and you're not the flame. Why are you worried about some damn flame? The flames are all over the place. There's nothing special about a flame.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay. Well, in this case, I have got a question. You mentioned Jhati, which is one of the links, one of the Nidanas in dependent origination, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the birth of the blues. Exactly, the birth of Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** So, okay, well, why do we then distinguish between becoming birth? Is clinging becoming birth?

**Speaker A:** And then when is a skin a skin and when is it a pimple?

**Speaker B:** Say that again.

**Speaker A:** When is skin skin and then when is it a pimple? What is the pimple? That's when it becomes a pimple when you discover that it's a pimple. Until then, it was just skin.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so are we talking about the birth of a pimple?

**Speaker A:** We're talking about process and discovery and seeing clearly what's going on, rather than staying in magical beliefs about what could be in some story, and recognize that the only thing that we really can see clearly, if we would look, is what's happening right now. And so that's what we do, is we pay attention to what's going on right now, rather than continuingly to think about the past and the future, and what we want, and our desires, and all of that kind of stuff. Sit down and be satisfied with what we've got right now. It's easy enough. We're just in such a habit of wanting stuff that we forget that we don't really need all of the stuff we want. So just sit down and enjoy this present moment, because that's really all we got. People say, I want all— I want this present moment off into the long distance future, but when they're in the long distant future, still thinking about more long distance future instead of thinking about this present moment, they've wasted all that long distant future. Instead of just sitting here and enjoying this moment, and this moment too. Yeah, no place to go and nothing to do, just sit here and enjoy the moment. Nothing could be easier. The teaching of the Buddha is easy peasy. But teachings like rebirth are to terrify and control. It's a mind control issue. When the Buddha speaks about right speech and right action and right lifestyle, he's doing so from the perspective of a noble mind. When the mind is noble, we refrain from killing. When the mind is noble, we refrain from taking things that are offered. When the mind is safe, secure, satisfied, and successful, overflowing with the feeling of success to the point that you feel wealthy, then you're not going to go around gossiping about people who would be a Dhamma teacher. There's no need to. You've already got everything that you want. Why should you worry about becoming enlightened? If I have to give up satisfaction, I'm not satisfied with what I got right now, I have to give that up so that I can have enlightenment instead? No thanks, I'll take satisfaction instead. I've got what I got, that's good enough. I'm the winner now, and everybody else is a wannabe because what they got is not good enough. They want something better. So that's the real teaching, is to learn to be satisfied. This is what Sukkha, which is part of Anapanasati practice, is really all about. We gladden the mind in order to talk ourselves into feeling like we are safe and secure, because we tell ourselves we're safe and secure, not recognizing that if we're not doing that, we're probably having thoughts that make us feel terrified. Like the mailman cometh, or something really ridiculously terrible. I mean, what if he brings a death notice? What if, what if, what if, what if? And then we get all terrified. We can instead have thoughts about, guess what, no postman now, everything's okay, everything is fine. So we come into relaxation and the reality that we were safe all along if we just drop all of those unwholesome thoughts. So we terrify ourselves. Here we are as human beings, we were in the jungle and we were terrified in the jungle, and so we built cities, and now they call it the concrete jungle and everybody's still terrified. And now we've given Mother Earth a skin rash, it's called cities. But we're still not safe. When are we going to start feeling safe? When we look at the fact that right now I am safe. Let me feel safe right now because I am, and I can trust this plastic chair is not going to fall apart. For at least the next 5 minutes. So let me enjoy it for the next 5 minutes, because that's all I need. That's the chair to hold up, and I'm not really all that sure it's going to do so. It's not the first one to go. Okay, but for the next 5 years, all we have to do is kind of get ourselves in the state that I can handle the next 5 minutes just fine. Doesn't matter what happens, I can handle it. Start changing our attitude from being a victim of all the things that can go wrong into the reality is that right now nothing's going wrong, and I'm wise enough to see it that way. So we take a deep breath and we relax. This is the real teachings of the Buddha right here. This is the Anapanasati and the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble That's all there is to it. It's to wake up, look at what we're doing, make a change, and relax. And then enjoy. And then we get the idea with success, I can do this, I've done it so many times before, I can do it. Then we can really settle down, we got it made now, because I know how to handle this next moment, it doesn't matter what this next moment brings. I'll be there for.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right. Yeah, you're, you're not trying to game reality, you're trying to game your own mind almost.

**Speaker A:** No, I'm trying to train the mind to pay attention correctly to reality. Very much is like getting in tune, that nature is a song or a tempo, or leela, some Asians call it, a dance. And if we waddle out on stage not knowing what the dance steps are, we might get run over or booed. But if we know the dance steps, we know what the tune is, then we can just fit right in happily. Wow, look at this, I can fit right in, I can see what's going on. Which is another way of saying that I can become friends with all the other dancers on the stage who's got it in in sync. All the world's a stage and everyone's an actor, and sometimes we're in sync, and most of the time we're running into each other and yelling at each other. But if we could get in sync with other people, then life becomes a dance again, like it is in nature. We're getting in tune, getting in sync, getting in the rhythm. Running to dance, that's not magic at all. It's just paying attention to what's going on and getting some skills.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Yeah, it's funny how much of the time you spend kind of like feeling a great sense of lack and want. I'm like, oh, I really need to fill this up with something.

**Speaker A:** Um, yeah, well, there's a whole lot of ways to look at that. One of the ways to look at it is that every young child, human being, is born completely dependent. And if it's not nurtured and fed and clothed and made warm and given a smile or two and a Gucci, Gucci, Gucci here and there, that child will die. All right, we are all dependent and we are nurtured when we're babies. By the time we're 5 or 6 years old, and it has many factors and circumstances, but generally we're put into school, told to do what to do, dress a certain way, hold the pencil this way, learn your ABCs, learn your 1, 2, 3s, up 2, 3, 4, fit in. And every child is terrified, and the joy of life begins to seep away, because now we're doing what we're told to do, rather than doing what we wanted to do while we were being nurtured. And we miss that, we miss that nurturing. And yet, when we meditate, we continue to grow. Criticize ourselves just like we've learned to do. We need to stop criticizing and accept ourselves. Well, everything's okay now. Wow, I don't have to work right now. I'm okay. Start having nurturing thoughts, tender thoughts. Everything is just fine.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's a really good idea.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I feel good. I can feel comfortable, I can feel secure. I can think about secure. How secure are you? Well, do you have any alligators? No. How about tarantulas? There's no tarantulas in the house, are there? How about Russian mobsters breaking through the windows?

**Speaker B:** Did you hear any take a flat?

**Speaker A:** No, no, there's nothing here. 'Everything is okay, everything is fine, I can relax.' Not even a SWAT team. And so having the silly thoughts like that, 'But those are silly thoughts, of course there's not any of that stuff, so why should I feel afraid?' is because maybe one of them will. And we know that's not going to happen, so relax already. That's what is— start having thoughts of teasing yourself into recognizing that you are safe. So feel that way. Nurture yourself into feeling safe, just like a little daddy will go with his little son into the closet to make sure there's no bears in there. But some daddies will just say, "Go to sleep. I don't care about your bear." And then the child will remain terrified and unsatisfied. So we have to go point out to that child inside of us that, "No, there's really nothing to be afraid of." And we can nurture ourselves. Instead of traumatizing ourselves with criticism, because that's what we do all day long. We've been taught to do that. We've been taught to be critical and to think critical. We even applaud critical thoughts. Hmm, yeah, which is thoughts of separation— me versus you, or this versus that. Or those versus them, all of that kind of stuff is done with that kind of duality, which is always critical, making those kinds of distinctions. So it's a kind of meta way of doing it, is when we see the mind doing that, we can put an end to it and come back into the nurturing instead. And bring the dualism back into one, mother and child bonding. Everything is fine.

**Speaker B:** Nice.

**Speaker A:** Well, this is the practice. Takes a lot of effort to genuinely allow yourself to feel safe and secure and comfortable and satisfied. Practice that over and over.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, I feel like, you know, it's getting late. I don't want to detain you. I thank you very much for speaking to me.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, we haven't even gotten anywhere yet. We still got to talk about the breath. So, okay, bring some air in, enjoy being alive, have some oxygen, it's free of charge. Pump right up. Having light thoughts, fill up with lightness, take a deep breath and then relax with an out breath. We'll go from there. But go enjoy yourself.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Go enjoy being alive.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Because people go around being alive and missing it all the time. They forget the fact that they're alive. Wow. See you later.

**Speaker B:** Great. Yeah. Okay. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Yes, see you, James.

**Speaker B:** Have a nice day. Bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** It's over now. It's now— now it's time to have a nice minute. You have a nice moment too.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A), centers on moving beyond literal or dogmatic interpretations of Buddhist teachings (like rebirth) to focus on their practical, psychological core: finding peace and satisfaction in the present moment.

Here is a summary of the key points:

1.  **Look Past the Stories to the Meaning:** The discussion begins with a question about literal rebirth stories in the suttas. Dhammarato advises not getting caught up in believing or debating the "story" (comparing them to Aesop's Fables or the story of Adam and Eve). The essential point is the **teaching within**—like cause and effect (kamma) or the consequences of judgment.

2.  **Rebirth as Metaphor, Not Literal Reincarnation:** Dhammarato distinguishes between **rebirth** (a continuous, impersonal process) and **reincarnation** (which implies a permanent "self" or soul moving from life to life). He suggests the Pali word *jāti* (often translated as "birth") can mean the **beginning or origin** of something (e.g., "the birth of the blues"), like the birth of dukkha (suffering) in the mind moment-to-moment.

3.  **The Core Practice: Satisfaction in the Present:** The heart of the talk is that the real Dhamma is about training the mind to be **safe, secure, and satisfied right now**. We terrify ourselves with thoughts about the past and future. Instead, we should:
    *   **Nurture ourselves** with calming, reassuring thoughts.
    *   **Recognize our present safety** ("No alligators, no tarantulas, no SWAT team").
    *   **"Sit down and enjoy this present moment, because that's really all we got."**

4.  **The Practical Path:** This approach is framed as the essence of **Ānāpānasati (mindfulness of breathing)** and the **Noble Eightfold Path**. It's about:
    *   **Gladdening the mind** to feel successful and wealthy in Dhamma.
    *   **Stopping self-criticism** and the habit of wanting.
    *   **Getting "in sync"** with reality, like learning the steps to a dance, which leads to harmony.

5.  **Cultural and Translational Issues:** Dhammarato briefly notes that Western misunderstandings can arise from relying on translators who may not deeply understand the Dhamma, and from missing the metaphorical nuances of ancient language.

**Overall Theme:** The talk is a pragmatic, psychological reinterpretation of Buddhism. It shifts focus away from metaphysical doctrines and toward a immediate, **therapeutic practice of self-nurturing and finding contentment in the ever-present "now,"** which is presented as the true and simple teaching of the Buddha.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary speaker (Speaker A) uses several metaphors and stories to illustrate their points about Buddhist teachings, interpretation, and mindfulness. Here is a breakdown:

### **1. Aesop's Fables (The Tortoise and the Hare)**
*   **Purpose:** To argue that religious or philosophical stories should be valued for their moral or teaching, not taken as literal truth.
*   **How it's used:** The speaker asks if anyone believes rabbits and tortoises actually have races. The point is that the value lies in the lessons ("slow and steady," "don't brag," "don't go to sleep on the job"), not in the story's factuality. This is directly applied to questioning the need to believe literal rebirth stories in the suttas.

### **2. The Story of Adam and Eve**
*   **Purpose:** To show how a simple teaching can be obscured by literal, magical interpretations.
*   **How it's used:** The speaker reduces the common understanding to "talking snakes" and "poison apples" to highlight how the core message is lost. They reinterpret the "fruit" as the "fruit of knowledge of good and evil," representing the karmic consequences of our judgments. The metaphor illustrates how judging things destroys our inner "Paradise."

### **3. The Candle Flame**
*   **Purpose:** To explain the Buddhist concept of *anatta* (not-self) and distinguish **rebirth** from **reincarnation**.
*   **How it's used:** The speaker uses the common metaphor of one candle lighting another to represent rebirth as a process without a permanent self ("the flame... a tenth of a second ago... is gone"). In contrast, reincarnation implies a solid, enduring self ("me") that transfers. The flame is a metaphor for a process, not an entity.

### **4. The Birth of the Blues**
*   **Purpose:** To reinterpret the Pali term *jati* (typically translated as "birth") metaphorically.
*   **How it's used:** Just as "the birth of the blues" means the *beginning* of a musical genre, *jati* in dependent origination can mean the "beginning" or "genesis" of dukkha (suffering) in the present moment, not necessarily a literal physical birth from a mother.

### **5. Skin and a Pimple**
*   **Purpose:** To explain how perception and mental labeling create our experience of "things" (like suffering).
*   **How it's used:** A pimple is just skin until we perceive and label it as a problem. Similarly, a moment of experience is just a process until clinging and becoming (*bhava*) lead to the "birth" (*jati*) of identifiable suffering. It's a metaphor for the process of dependent origination happening in the mind.

### **6. Life as a Dance (or Song)**
*   **Purpose:** To describe the goal of mindfulness and wisdom as harmonious alignment with reality.
*   **How it's used:** Nature/life is compared to a dance or song with its own rhythm (*leela*). When we are unaware ("waddle out on stage not knowing the dance steps"), we suffer. Practice is learning the steps to "fit right in happily" and get "in sync," turning conflict into harmony. This extends to the metaphor "All the world's a stage."

### **7. The Scared Child and the Nurturing Parent**
*   **Purpose:** To explain the inner work of self-compassion and overcoming habitual anxiety.
*   **How it's used:** The mind is compared to a terrified child who needs reassurance. We must become the nurturing parent to ourselves, checking the "closet" for bears (irrational fears) and offering comfort instead of criticism. This metaphor frames meditation as a practice of internal nurturing and building a sense of safety.

### **8. The Concrete Jungle / Earth's Skin Rash**
*   **Purpose:** To critique modern anxiety and environmental harm as extensions of primal fear.
*   **How it's used:** Humans fled the terrifying jungle to build cities, but now the "concrete jungle" is just as frightening. Cities are metaphorically a "skin rash" on Earth, showing our failure to find genuine safety externally. The solution is to find safety internally, in the present moment.

### **9. The Unreliable (but Good Enough) Plastic Chair**
*   **Purpose:** To illustrate the practice of pragmatic trust and contentment in the present.
*   **How it's used:** The speaker uses the chair they're sitting on to make a point: you don't need certainty about the far future. You only need enough trust to relax *for the next five minutes*. It's a metaphor for shifting from anxiety about the future to finding sufficiency in the present.

**Overall Theme:** The speaker consistently uses metaphors and stories to:
*   **Demythologize** Buddhist concepts (rebirth, karma).
*   **Reframe** practice as present-moment, psychological work (safety, nurturing, perception).
*   **Argue for a non-literal, pedagogical interpretation** of religious texts.
*   **Illustrate the core message** of finding satisfaction, safety, and harmony in the here and now.
