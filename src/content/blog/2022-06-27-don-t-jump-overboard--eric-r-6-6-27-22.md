### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, so Eric, you say you have something to read.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I got some heavy-duty questions. I've been, it's been a series of coincidences of small and medium confrontations I've had with people close to me. And the common theme has been like setting boundaries and wondering about my negative feelings towards these people when they ask me for support. So the topic I think is empathy. And the 3 questions I would like to start with are: Is all social behavior rule-driven? Then when someone asks me for support and I feel repulsion, sadness, laziness, disdain, how should I act? And is it better to support a person even though I don't really need that person in my life? And then what if it's someone I feel responsible for or someone that lives with me?

**Speaker A:** Did you write this or this is something that.

**Speaker B:** No, I was just gathering my experiences and I wrote it as questions.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so this is your question, not a question that you're reading.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but I wrote it before calling.

**Speaker A:** All right, all right. So the question now is about the word empathy. And things like this. It might be useful for us to get a little information about what's happening other than an overall— Oh, you're cutting off a bit. Ah, that'll help. Okay, so the question then has to do with someone that is close to you or lives in the same house with you?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's been 3 people this week, so it's been a common thing.

**Speaker A:** So this is 3 different people who have come to you wanting stuff? I see. What kind of stuff are they wanting?

**Speaker B:** Should I tell you the specific cases?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, one-liner for each one.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, here's the one-liner. One's my dad, and basically we've been estranged because I don't like him and he misses me, and it frustrates me that we can't just be estranged in peace. Then the other one is someone who lives with me that rents a room here that I thought I considered a friend because we've spent a lot of time together. But when this week her sick cat escaped from the house and she was screaming in frustration and I felt like repulsed. And then a cousin of mine who has lived here and is coming back to live here again. Wants to bring her newly adopted little kitten to live with us, and I refuse because we set a rule that tenants aren't allowed to have pets.

**Speaker A:** Okay, the second one, something escaped?

**Speaker B:** A sick cat.

**Speaker A:** A cat escaped?

**Speaker B:** Yes, her cat is living with us. It's been here for a month because it got sick and her mom, where it was, couldn't take care of it.

**Speaker A:** Okay, all right. So the problem is not the cat, the problem is her attachment to the cat. Let's take this one first.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I have considered that, but I don't know if what I'm most interested in is my reaction to that.

**Speaker A:** We'll get into that, sure, of course. Uh, the point though, uh, to make is, is that cats are not like dogs in the sense that, uh, they don't, they don't form social bonds the way that dogs do, and that cats also go on an outing. Now, I assumed that this cat was injured and she took it in and nursed it back to health, and so the cat thinks that, okay, I'm ready to go now, bye-bye, thanks for the help, but I'm out of here.

**Speaker B:** It's a cat that she's had for several years, but at her mom's house, and then she moved away, but when the cat got sick, her mom couldn't take care of it, so it was living with us for a month. And when they were coming back from the vet, she let go of it and then escaped.

**Speaker A:** OK, all right. So the question then becomes, is that when the cat did what cats do, which is escape, she got all uptight about it. Mm-hmm. And you decided that you'd want to get uptight also.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but it was in the sense that I wanted to get away from that, from that uptightness.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so could you— I mean, you've got a room, you can close the door. Yeah, yeah, so problems, problem solved.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. On that part.

**Speaker A:** And she will get over the cat.

**Speaker B:** No, it came back.

**Speaker A:** It came back. Well, cats do that too.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so her frustration and uptightness, etc., for the cat having gone was wasted effort. Yeah, she could have waited 3 days, and when the cat didn't come back, then she could have been uptight and upset. But she wouldn't give the cat a chance to have any freedom. I get you. In other words, she had the idea that she owned the cat and the cat has to do what she wants the cat to do. This cat is mine. Yeah, how dare my cat leave without my permission.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. What I was worried about is that I have— we have two other friends that live in the neighborhood, and my girlfriend was here, and the reaction of the three of them was like, okay, we'll help her look for it. And it was like chill, you know, but my reaction was like, I want to get away from this. And I want to like explore how to deal with those feelings because I feel like I could have had a better reaction.

**Speaker A:** Well, how did you react to them is not the issue, but how you reacted on the inside, because I assume that you didn't give them a bunch of grief because they were already in a bunch of grief. I assume that you didn't give them a bunch of crap about them being in a bunch of crap. I assume that you just walked away. Is that right?

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, problem solved then. Now all you have to do is start some Anapanasati and start having some wholesome thoughts. Yeah, and forget all about the cat. Okay. Okay, and that in fact the cat came back, so now there's no problem. Eventually you might want to point out to her that all her anguish and frustration over the cat being gone was wasted. She could have waited until the cat died. Yeah, she could have waited until the cat died and then feel bad.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'd rather not do that though.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, I don't see much of an issue there, um, but everybody else— go ahead.

**Speaker B:** I guess I was asking for permission.

**Speaker A:** Okay, yes, you, you have permission to not buy other people's trouble. And you see all of the other people, they went to hunt for the cat, but the cat's going to show up when the cat wants to show up, not when they're— what is being caught. Cats are hard to catch.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** They'Re kind of independent that way. Uh, I've dealt with cats before. And that the cats will hang around only as long as it's convenient for them to. I've seen cats that were in the household for 10 years and a puppy shows up and the cat is gone within a week, never to be seen again. So this is— in fact, the amusing stuff is what they put on YouTube about dogs and cats loving each other and getting along with each other and that kind of thing. But that's kind of unusual circumstance, and that it generally happens in the sense that one or the other or both of the animals were newborns when they met. And if it's an adult, then it's a female. Generally, with some exceptions, like maybe Labradors will take in a kitten, but generally it doesn't happen that way. Okay, so cats are very independent, but this is not about cats because you don't care because you don't have a cat. The question is, you have two cats, well, where did they go during this time?

**Speaker B:** They were around.

**Speaker A:** They were around. Okay, so one cat goes on walkabout and the other cats stay home. How would it have been if one of your cats had gone on walkabout and her cat stayed home?

**Speaker B:** Well, that would happen, and I do rounds in the neighborhood asking about it. A little worried, but not too much.

**Speaker A:** There's something also on the side about that, and that is that while there is considerable amount of dog napping, it is very rare to find cat napping. That's not a common thing. Why? Because cats don't get themselves in a position of getting napped the way that a dog will. Yeah, partly because of that issue of loyalty and all of that. So we can say then that there's not much to this because you do now, both inside with your own mind and also by me doubling down on it, that it's okay for you to not feel bad just because someone that you know feels bad. And yet in our society, that's what compassion is. Okay, we can call it a pity party. Once someone has a problem— oh, poor me, my cat's gone— all the women in the house will go, oh, poor me too, because my friend's cat's gone. And everybody has a pity party. Okay, so here's an example that kind of brings us home, and that is that you're on a boat at sea and a friend who you know does not swim falls overboard. Are you going to jump in the water with them? Maybe, uh-huh.

**Speaker B:** Maybe I, like, um, hey, I would swim in the, in the vicinity to see if I could do something.

**Speaker A:** Well, the whole issue though is, is that it's the whole boat's responsibility for someone going overboard, not your personal responsibility. That if you can throw them a life raft, because boats are supposed to have that kind of equipment They also have the ability slowly to turn around and to go back and find the person at sea. But now what happens if you jump overboard to save them and now nobody knows that they've got two people overboard? That's all right. So your job is to not jump overboard with them. Your job is to do what you can do to get them back on board. Right. Okay. In that regard, this is the problem with compassion and empathy and all of that, is that our style, Western-style empathy and compassion, is that when somebody jumps overboard into the sea of bad feelings, everybody's supposed to jump overboard too. And that's not the right way to do it. You should stay on board. You should stay high and dry and do what you can to bring the people who have jumped overboard back into dry, high— right? That's the whole point of compassion, that we have to understand that this is the What I'm talking about is this. This is Karuna, the Pali word for Karuna, which has been wrongly translated as compassion. But in fact, you can hear the word compassion and see where that word comes from. The word 'com' in this regard is a Latin phrase that means 'with' or a Latin particle. So with passion. So if somebody is all passioned up, you're supposed to have compassion. You're supposed to get all passioned up too. You see, if they fall into the water, you're supposed to jump into the water with them. This is our society. It's based— actually, this is Christian. This is not Islamic. This is not worldwide. This is something that— an example of that, by the way, that I have seen on more than one occasion, but we give this example, is that 4 or 5 or 6 Thai teenagers are just horsing around and going down the street and having fun, whatever, and one of them falls. And everybody else will laugh while he gets up and laughs. Now, in the West, if some— the same situation and somebody falls down, especially the girls, but everybody will go back to him and say, 'Oh, here, let me help you up. Oh, poor dear.' Right? That's the difference in the Thai society, is that the other people make no big deal out of it. And so the person can make no big deal out of it also. But in the West, when somebody falls down, everybody makes a big deal out of it. And so the person makes a big deal out of it also. Okay. One of the things that you could have said to her was, oh, don't worry about the cat, it'll come back. Don't have to worry about it. Cats take a hike, and sometimes they come back and sometimes they don't, but don't worry about it. You'll be okay. All right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Now I understand also that she had a lot of investment in the cat because she was nursing it back to health, and so all of my nursing skills have gone to crap because the cat is gone. How can I continue to nurse the cat when the cat is gone? And in fact, the cat doesn't think that it needs any more nursing. In fact, the cat may have escaped from the nursing that it was getting. So in this regard, we can find a new way of handling compassion, and that is by looking at the Brahma Viharas from the perspective— and one of the things that we can mention offhand is the that Metta, Karuna, Mudita, and Upekkha are not meditation skills or practices. They are the result of correct practice, which is not Metta, not Karuna, not Mudita. So let's move to Mudita, which is sympathetic vibrations. They call it sympathetic joy. But the quality of sympathetic is important here. All right. Let me mention this, that if you have a violin that's correctly tuned in a room all by itself and someone comes in with a trumpet and plays an A and then walks out of the room and somebody else walks into the room, they can still hear that violin. Sympathetically vibrating to that A that the trumpet made. The trumpet has stopped and the guy's left the room, but the violin is still sympathetically vibrating. Okay, this is a major, major physical and mental attribute of our physical universe, is this idea of sympathetic vibration. And so what's happening is, is that when she's got the pity party going, she's vibrating pity party and everybody else ignorantly starts to vibrate at the level that she's vibrating at. Right. This is actually— we can see this in the example of someone who gets angry. One of the qualities of that guy is, is that he wants to go around and share his anger. He wants other people to be angry too. If he's angry at the bank, he wants everybody to be angry at the bank. And if he's angry at you, he wants you to be angry at him. That's just the way that we operate as human beings based upon this sympathetic vibration. Okay, the question is, are you wise enough and well-skilled enough to not go around vibrating at other people's frequencies. All right, the problem though is, is that you have been vibrating at other people's frequencies all these years. You were taught that. So Anapanasati is learning to stop vibrating the way that we used to vibrate and start vibrating the way that we want to vibrate. Get some good vibrations. Got some good vibes. Okay, once we have those vibrations, now with the quality of Mudita, we can go share that. We can go share our joy. And that's the way to handle people who are in a pity party, is by spreading joy. If somebody's angry, Don't get angry with them. You can sympathize with them, but the sympathy has to be with gladdening their mind because you've been able to gladden your mind. The whole idea then is you can do this, let us say, subconsciously through smiling. So when she comes in, oh, poor me, my cat's lost, we can— 'Well, now you don't have to take care of that cat, do you?'.

**Speaker B:** I just have a little comment on smiling. I've been using that throughout the practice since the beginning, and lately I began to have like a little jaw pain, and it was related to what you said about— that talk with Beau and Robert where you were mentioning that it doesn't— or Beau was saying that it doesn't do anything for people to tell them to concentrate because they just look like they're trying hard. And I noticed that when I prolonged my meditations or I was in a public space and suddenly one person comes, I like tense up a bit because of trying to do something. And whenever I feel that dropping now, I just like identify the tension and relax it.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So the sympathetic vibrations that we're going to use have to do with joy. The problem, though, is, is that when you're working with a very— we'll call it bitter situation— it's going to take more sugar than normal. Okay. That's the whole point, is, is that you cannot come with a teaspoon of sugar to help this medicine go down. You need a scoop of it. You need a shovel full of it. And I don't mean a hand shovel. I'm talking about a steam shovel full of sugar so that you can keep spreading it and keep spreading it and keep your joy going. And eventually your joy will wear them down into reality, out of the poor me. So this is the way that you can handle it if you can remember.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but also sometimes the question, can.

**Speaker A:** You remember to keep joy? Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** That sometimes people don't really want to get out of that state and feel—.

**Speaker A:** That'S why it takes so much. That's why it takes so much joy, is because they want to stay in their pity party. They came— she went to the other girls to have a pity party with them, and the other girls went out looking for the cat. All right, so this is common human behavior. That's right, when someone's stuck in a pity party, they really don't want to be saved. They want to justify their bad feelings. Okay, the example that was used when I was studying psychology is, is that if someone goes into a bar and doesn't order a drink, maybe he's just asking for information or something like that, the barfly will say, "Have a drink." And if the guy refuses to have a drink, we're causing a problem. Why is that? Because the guys who were drinking know that it's antisocial, that there is something wrong with it, that it is dangerous. And if we can get a complete stranger to come drink with me, then that means that it's it's okay with him that I drink. But if he don't drink and I'm drinking, that means that he might be looking down upon me. This is exactly the whole quality that you've heard is misery loves company, and you're not going to give misery company. You're not going to jump into that ocean just because they did. If you can stay mindful, if you can remember that you do not have to join their pity party— that's the hard part. The hard part is for you to wake up and to get your joy together and to keep your joy together while you're maneuvering around their pity party. This is why it's going to take a lot of joy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but then the practical matter or a consequence of, let's say, right now I feel like I barely have enough joy to keep myself afloat. And I would rather understand that.

**Speaker A:** That's the whole point then, is that that's the most important point, is can you have the mentality to do this? And if you don't, then it is better for you to not be in that pity party. If your choice is to either be in the pity party or to leave, then the right answer is to leave. So you chose the right answer, is to get away from it, because you don't have the skills to put up with their pity party while you're not having a pity party. So if you walk into that bar and everybody in the bar wants you to drink with them, you're either going to stay in the bar and not drink, which is causing a problem, or you can get out of that bar. Okay, so in your case, the answer would be correctly to get out of the situation. Oh, I hope you find your cat. I hope you feel better about not finding your cat. But meanwhile, I gotta go. See you later. So that's the way to handle that one, that in fact that might be the correct answer for the other two questions.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I was thinking about that.

**Speaker A:** All right, so that's, that's the choice that you have. If you know that you've got the skills to deal with the situation, then deal with it, or how long it takes to deal with it. If you are unsure that you have the skills to deal with it then recognize that it's not your business, it's not your job, it's not your cat, and her feelings are not your feelings. That this is the, uh, the, um, this is the point about wisdom, I would say, in the sense that this is real wisdom, is to know whether you can handle the situation or not. And if you can handle it, then do it wisely. And if you can't, don't. Now we can bring in other things other than a missing cat, because you know you can't help anything with the cat. The cat's not yours anyway. But we can look at it in another case, and that would be political activism. I can name you 100 different political activist ideas or issues, and then with each one of them say, and it's not your business because you can't solve the problem. And everybody will keep saying, oh, but it is our business because it's dangerous. Okay, so one of them is, is that, oh, we're about to lose our democracy, or women are about to lose their ability to get abortions, or there is global warming and all of those kind of things. And the right idea for Dhamma dude is to recognize none of those things are my business. My business is to get my head together. My business is to deal with my issues, and that my issues can be dealt directly. And I don't have to go solve global warming in order for me to feel good. I can sit here and feel good while things get warm. And the question is, is if the world does get warm and there is global warming, then there is flooding, can I be happy then too? So if they start bringing guns all over the place, can I find a place where I don't have to deal with all of those guns? Because all those guns are not my business. But if I try to go take a gun away from somebody, that's really stupid, dangerous thing to do, as you can tell. All right, so this is actually now the introduction into the quality of almost everything is not your business, it's somebody else's business, and they won't help with their business, and they'll try to recruit you to come join their army and fight war for them and with them. I mean, can you imagine if the generals of the Ukrainian army and the generals of the Russian army were put into a room together to work things out? I mean, why do you have to kill 150 children just because two old men are having an argument? And everybody gets into that argument and saying, oh, well, I'm on the side of that general, I'm on the side of this general, let's all have a war, let's all fight. Right? This is the mentality of compassion. If that general wants to have a war, you got to go help him have a war. If we have to go on a cat search, We need a whole lot of help to do a cat search. We want to recruit you to come help us. And the recruit has to then make that mental connection that this is my business too. I own this. Not only is it her cat that's lost, it's my cat that's lost also.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And the reality is, now that I think about it, what made my reaction more impactful to them might have been that I took it seriously. If I had just left like, oh, don't worry, it'll come back. They would just be like, oh, Eric.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's right. That's what a bum. But that would have been the sympathetic joy that you wanted to share. Oh, don't worry about it. The cat's going to be okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but I left open.

**Speaker A:** The same thing happened last night with Kitty. We've got a new puppy in the room and in the house, and we've got two old matron female dogs who haven't had puppies. One of them's 11, the other one is 9 years old, and we've got a 6-week-old puppy in the house, and they're not about to go mother that puppy. They growl at the puppy when she comes close. And the problem with that is actually is that the puppy is in that really heavy-duty biting stage where, you know, little puppies about this age, they will chew on anything, and they especially delight in chewing on human flesh like your arm or the paw of another dog or whatever. Like that. And they also do the kneading and the sucking that young puppies do. Well, a 6-week-old puppy, a 7-week-old puppy— mothers do not want to nurse 7-week-old puppies because their tits get destroyed with all of the kneading with those sharp little claws and all of those sharp new teeth. Right. So given that Kitty now is afraid to have her little puppy and these other dogs in the same room, and I'm saying, no, you've got to let them work this out. Put the puppy down and watch what goes on. That is actually very interesting to watch this because he's afraid that the big dog is going to hurt the little dog. And the big dogs are already making sounds of don't come close to me. They're not making the kind of sounds as I'm going to eat you. They don't make that kind of sound. They make the sound of don't come close to me. And Kitty doesn't know the difference. She can't tell the difference between the growling of a dog of don't come close to me versus I'm about to kill you. And so she doesn't understand that. So I had to teach her to put her puppy down and watch what happens. We need to have it. As long as she holds and protects that puppy from the bigger dogs, she'll always have a problem. They will be jealous and all kinds of things. But if we treat the dogs equally, they'll get along. I've already seen the progress going on. Okay. But Kitty has the mentality, this puppy is mine. This is my business that the two dogs are not friends yet, rather than letting the dogs work it out. They will. All of the dogs will survive and they will become friends, but it's a process that has to happen, okay? And it's not her business. And that cat is not yours. It's not your business. Global warming is not your business. Okay, that's a really important question to begin to understand, is that a lot of stuff that we think is our business is because we've been socialized into thinking that everything is our business. Everything is our business. Look at the way that Christians, they want to proselytize. Look at all of the, uh, the signs at war of Uncle Sam Wants You. Patriotism. Okay, you got to be local. You have to support the football team that's in your town. You can't support the football team in the town that you used to live in because the people in this town will kill you because they want you to support their football team, you see. All right, so this is the way that we've been socialized, and the socialization is compassion, which means that our compassion is, is that when someone is having a pity party, it's your pity party too. And the reality is, is their pity party is none of your business. Your business is to stay out of their pity party.

**Speaker B:** Are you saying that all socialization in general is compassion, or in the West?

**Speaker A:** And generally in the West. In fact, this is the issue about what does the word empathy and sympathy mean in in relationship to the word compassion, that we can have sympathy for someone, but the sympathy that we're having now, the sympathy would be to throw them a life raft, throw them a buoy with a rope and haul them back on board. Compassion is jumping in with them. Okay, so real sympathy, real empathy is not getting wet and still helping. This is a really, really big issue for Westerners to come to the teachings of the Buddha because it looks like that Buddhism then is hard-nosed, doesn't get involved, etc. Like that. I'll give you an example about this with Ajahn Poh. Ajahn Poh for years and still is the abbot, the senior abbot of Wat Suwan Mokkh. He's been the abbot, I think, since 1967, '69, something like that. And so he'd been the abbot all these years, and all kinds of people over the years have brought all kinds of trouble to him about the what. The what needs this, the what needs that. This is wrong, these people are fighting, whatever like that. And you know what his response generally is to every question that comes by?

**Speaker B:** What is it?

**Speaker A:** Well, he doesn't do anything. Because their problem is not his problem. Their business is not his business. And not only that, but Ajahn Po once told me, he said, why should I do anything when there's all kinds of people who will do it for them? In other words, they go to him, and if he's not going to help, they'll go to this old monk over there. And if he doesn't help them, then they'll go to this other monk, and that monk now will help them do their problem. So Ajahn Po winds up, he doesn't have to do anything. But in fact, that happened with you. She found somebody else to go help her search for the cats, and you didn't have to go. Not your business. So you could say, well, how could Ajahn Po run a wat when he does nothing? The answer to that is because the wat runs well enough that it doesn't need him to run it. It's already running by itself quite well.

**Speaker B:** But if it didn't, would he?

**Speaker A:** Well, I would say that it's always been OK and running just the way that it needs to be running in that moment, even after Bhikkhu Buddhadasa died, that the population of monks dropped from about the top of about 400 down to like maybe 50 or 60. That would have been a catastrophe to lose two-thirds or three-quarters of all the monks in the wat, right? What did Ajaan Po do? Nothing. And now there's more monks back. They've come back. Not so many, but it took years for them to come back. But how did he get them to come back? He didn't do anything.

**Speaker B:** That's nice.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so this is the way of beginning to understand this, is that just because things happen doesn't mean that you have to feel bad enough to go do something about it, that you could choose to do what you want to do based upon whether or not you consider it mine or not. And when you get into the position that very little belongs to you, then that gives you very little business to do, because it's not your business. Uncle Sam wants you. Who, me? No, he doesn't want me. The Democrats need voters. Who, me? Not a voter. I don't vote. That's not my business. Politics is not my business. Cat hunting, not my business. What reform? Not my business. Okay, not my business. M-N-M-B. Okay, this is a new acronym for you: Not My Business. That's a hard lesson to learn, and you have to learn it on every little one, one of the things, one at a time. Not my business, not my business, not my business. Because there's 10,000 things that you used to think is your business, and none of them are your business. So one by one, as they occur, you'll have to keep repeating: Not my business.

**Speaker B:** But as a question, like, is it not my business? Surely not, right?

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** But it's better to say it as a question, like, to make the investigation, even though it's a small moment, instead of writing it off as not my business without doing well.

**Speaker A:** I would say the not my business is the result of the investigation. Anicca. Okay. To keep investigating, to figure out that, yeah, for sure, it's not mine, doesn't belong to me, not my problem, not my business. And so you can begin then to say, oh, this big box of stuff that is my business, let me set it down over there.. And one by one, as the items occur that come out of that box into the present moment, I can make a choice. Is this my business or not? And more than likely you would put it back into the box because it's not your business. So one by one as they occur, make an inspection, make sure for sure, does this belong to me? Is this I, me, or mine? And we're going to keep track of the fact that there is no self, so how could anybody own anything anyway? And so that's the real investigation that we need to make, is that we need to start with the premise that this stuff is not my business. And the only reason that I would consider my business is because I've got feelings about.

**Speaker B:** It.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Feelings about control. And then we begin to understand that the only thing that really is my business is this next breath. And this next thought and this next feeling. That's our.

**Speaker B:** Business. This relates to what you said about— I connected what you said about someone being promoted at their jobs until they're not capacitated to do that final job they land in with humanity as a whole and being promoted from the animal kingdom to Basically, we thought we were like some kind of god, but really— That's right.

**Speaker A:** Most people I know are not qualified to be human beings, but they were promoted to that anyway. Yeah, most generals in the army, whatever army in whatever country, almost all of the generals are unqualified. They were promoted up to a level that they're incapable of managing. Well, of course Donald Trump is incompetent, of course Joe Biden is incompetent. The job is too big for anyone. All we can do is elect one incompetent person after another, after another, because the situation is set up to make a job too big for one person. And so both sides The Republicans say, look how incompetent their president is. And then the next election, and this guy says, well, look at how incompetent their president is. Yeah, well, that's politics for you. And the joy of that is, for you and me, is that, yeah, but that politics is not my business. Let me be— let me have business that I am competent at. And gain the skills at it. So the real business is this next breath, this next thought, this next feeling. Those are our business. And if you can't handle other people's business by basically handling your own business— so if you cannot be joyful while she's miserable about her cat gone, then the best thing for you to do is to move away and go take care of your own business. Find some seclusion to get your mind back together again. Now here's the point about that, and that is she had several people helping her find a cat, right? Nobody helped, really. Cat came back by itself. Nobody found the cat. So how many global warming demonstrations have we had? Is the planet cool now because of all these global warming demonstrations? No. So all of these demonstrations are not useful. In fact, the joke is, on that level, that people would fly in an airplane from California to Washington, D.C. to protest global warming, when in fact all that jet fuel that they used to get there was doing global warming. If everybody who really wanted to stop global warming would stop global warming by just sitting down at home waiting till things cool off, things would cool off. That in fact, the heat happens because people are trying to make it cool. Look how hard they try and how much heat they're generating by trying to make things cool. And when we recognize that through wisdom, we can say, wait a minute, the best thing to do is nothing at all. And that happens on almost everything that you can examine. Everything that you took out of that box, it says, is this mine or not? The answer is probably it's not mine, doesn't belong to me, not my business. Let me put that aside again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the only thing I can think of is that there is evidence that there have been major asteroid impacts to Earth. And that it would be useful to get the technology advanced up to the point that we can destroy asteroids before.

**Speaker A:** They— Oh, do you have— are you— do you have rocket parts all over your bedroom? Do you— do you— do you have the physics? Do you know how to get your rocket to hit that asteroid?

**Speaker B:** I mean, in other.

**Speaker A:** Words, you already have enough people who were worried about asteroids that they're doing something about it. Why should you go joined their pity party.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I wasn't talking about myself. I'm glad that someone's doing it, right?

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, let them do that job. That means that you don't have to, because there's always a bunch of people trying to solve the problem. Let them solve it. This comes to the point about— imagine that a wagon, an old-timey wagon, a horse-drawn wagon, fell off the road into the creek. Creek, and everybody in town was called to please help me get this wagon out of the creek. Okay, so 20 or 30 people show up to push this wagon out of the creek, and every one of them can only get a place to put their hand on the truck to push. And now everybody is pushing from all different directions. Are they going to be able to get that wagon out of the creek? No, they're going to destroy the wagon, right? Because everybody's pushing in a different direction. Okay, so that's what you have in politics, is you've got two different groups of people that are all pushing from all different sides and directions to try to solve a problem, and all they're doing is destroying things. Better to let them fight it out and we can take a.

**Speaker B:** Hike.

**Speaker A:** We could sit there and watch them so that life becomes a spectator sport. You don't have to be the champion out on the field trying to solve every problem. So you can think of, okay, so you got asteroids, we've got global warming, we got guns, we've got abortion. What other things could you not get involved with? Oh yeah, that's right, Ukraine. Do you and I want to go sign up and go to Ukraine to fight? No, not my problem. So this is the way we begin to understand, is that so many things that we thought were your problem are really not your problem. Your problem is to get your own mind together, to get your own breathing correct, to get your own feelings in gear. This is the real issue. And when you get that stuff done, then you can make that something that you could share with other people, so that the girl who lost the cat can get her mind together, can get her breathing together, and get her feelings together. This you can help her with. This is your.

**Speaker B:** Job.

**Speaker A:** Anagami. Okay, so now that we've gotten two of the problems solved, I think we've got all of them solved. Let's, let's go over the, uh, the other two.

**Speaker B:** No, it's basically the same.

**Speaker A:** Um, it's the same thing, isn't it? Yeah. So your dad, your dad's not your problem.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the thing about him is.

**Speaker A:** That.

**Speaker B:** I mean, it's the same answer, but it's like a more drastic case, let's say, in Western considerations, that he doesn't have many friends and he has health issues, but mostly he complains a lot and is negative or talks negatively to himself and to others.

**Speaker A:** And yeah, do you talk negatively back to him, huh? Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay. In fact, I wrote the things that I wanted, that I thought about it and I would say to him, and it's like Arahant.

**Speaker A:** Texts. All right, so the way that you can handle that then is to recognize that the only thing that you can do for your dad is to give him something that is actually your business, and that is joy. Okay, add a little sugar to his day. Give him a little perk up. You know, you can find all kinds of things to say. Um, one of the things that I actually used with my mother many, many years ago, which really helped our relationship quite a lot and helped her also, was a little phrase: ain't it awful? But, but we don't say it from the pity party— ain't it awful? We say it from the humorous point The joy. Oh, well, ain't that awful? So when your dad's complaining about he has no friends, you can say, well, ain't that awful that you don't have any friends? Do you want some? Then he'll say, I don't know how to make friends. And you can say, oh, well, ain't that awful? And then chuckle. And maybe you could get him to chuckle too. That's what happened with my mom. And pretty soon my mom was going around looking at every problem that she had with that little joke. Ain't it awful? Ain't it awful that Granny's in the hospital? Ain't it awful that Aunt Susie doesn't come visit? So that's the way of beginning to handle this, by giving your dad joy. You can't fix him. Fixing him is not your problem, it's his problem. Your problem is, can you maintain your state of joy, your state of happiness, your state of satisfaction Anagami pattern when you're around him, and let that rub off sympathetically. Hobnob with joy. Hobnob? What? Hobnob, rubbing shoulders with, you know, or being in the group. Bring your joy. That's the way to deal with your.

**Speaker B:** Dad. Yeah. At this point, I feel like my joy, it's there constantly, but it flickers at the minimum things, the smallest things.

**Speaker A:** Oh, he'll do what he can to put it out. Yeah, okay. And the first way of dealing with that is, is that when he gets too much for you, when he has robbed you of your joy, take a hike. Get away from him. Go get your joy. Go get your mojo again, and then come.

**Speaker B:** Back.

**Speaker A:** But don't join him in his pity party. Don't join him in his no friends and bad health and all of that. Bring him into the moment. Get him to look at a.

**Speaker B:** Flower. Yeah, the part of taking a hike when I'm— when I've lost my mojo Sometimes, or most of the time, people don't understand why I'm doing it, and I've tried to explain it.

**Speaker A:** You can make a little excuse, a little white lie, like, oh, well, I got to go to the toilet right.

**Speaker B:** Now.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I got to go put money in the parking meter. I mean, something silly. Just take a hike. Yeah, I'll be right back. You don't even have to make an excuse. You can just say, I'll be right back. 'What does write back mean? 5 minutes, 20 minutes, an hour, 3 weeks?' Yeah, 'Let me go check on.

**Speaker B:** Something.' Yeah, because what I've done is to try to explain to them why I meditate and why I need seclusion, but that's too serious.

**Speaker A:** Right? What now?

**Speaker B:** What I've done when I feel like taking a hike is later explain to them, because people get offended when I just leave, and I tend to leave like cramped up or seriously. So then I try to explain that I meditate and stuff, but then people are like, what?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, don't try to make those kind of excuses. No, that's, that's You can say instead, "Oh, well, I was feeling a little down for a moment, and so I had to go get my mojo." But they probably will not understand it when you say, "I've got to go meditate." That's kind of— I wouldn't use.

**Speaker B:** That.

**Speaker A:** Because that's asking for them to get confused.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, another.

**Speaker A:** Hindrance. So yeah, just getting away from it. I go check on something, or hey, let me go look at this thing and I'll be right back. And then what does right back mean? So that's the way that you can handle that kind of thing, is to get away from it, to get away from it all. And if you're wise, you can do that happily. You can get your mojo right back, just enough mojo to get yourself happily out of the room. Or you can just take a deep breath right in front of them with the thought, hey, I can handle this. Let me just give myself a moment. I'll get my mojo.

**Speaker B:** Back.

**Speaker A:** Because after you develop the skill, it doesn't take long. And you can begin to tell your dad everything's going to be all right, everything's going to be fine. Yeah, he's going to get sick and die, but that happens to everybody. Is your dad unique? No, he's not unique, he's not special. He's getting old, he's getting sick, and he's dying, and he don't like it a bit. You're going to get You're going to get sick and you're going to die. And right now it's so far away that it doesn't bother you, but when it gets close, it might. So it's better to be ready for it when it's still far away. So you can actually use your dad as, um, let us say, a teacher of what happens to people when they get old and they get sick and they don't know how to do.

**Speaker B:** It.

**Speaker A:** And keep adding joy, keep adding joy. Ain't it awful, Dad, you're so sick? And he'll get pissed off the first time you say that. He may get pissed off the ninth time you say that, but eventually it will get through to him. That you're teasing him, that you're lightening him up, and then it will become effective. That's why I say, in this case, a teaspoon full of sugar is all you have to get down. But you can't start with a teaspoon of sugar because he's going to knock that out of your hand a thousand times. Or maybe 10 or 15 times. So you need quite a lot of sugar. It's going to be all over the place with just a little of it getting.

**Speaker B:** In. I don't think that it would be like he gets happy when we're together. But what makes it difficult for me is that he's too clingy. I feel he's too clingy. And that I feel like threatened in a way, like my freedom or my.

**Speaker A:** Integrity. Well, one of the ways you can handle that is by recognizing you're actually quite grateful for your dad, because without him you wouldn't be alive, that he gave you life. And so you could be grateful to him for that. Wow, Dad, I'm really glad that you're there. Without you, what would I ever come to? And so you can start giving him gratitude. You can thank him for being a good dad to you. And when you say, oh, but he wasn't a good dad to me, that's your hindrance, that's your unwholesome thought. Throw that thought out and go find what Dad did for you that is worthwhile, that is worth thanking him for, and then go thank him for that instead of grumbling about all the bad stuff that he has done. No, go find something good that he has done and then thank him for it.

**Speaker B:** Knit a sweater with it. Pardon? Knit a sweater with.

**Speaker A:** It. So you said that you had 3 things. We've talked about cat, we've talked about dad. What's the third one? Another cat.

**Speaker B:** Pardon?

**Speaker A:** Another cat. Another cat, right. What's the story on this.

**Speaker B:** Cat? Dhammarato: Two cousins are coming to live here and they found an abandoned kitten, but I don't allow pets here and she really wanted to bring it here and she cried and I was a bit swayed, but then by talking to it with my mom we decided that it could be mostly a tantrum and that we would would abide by our rule of not allowing pets.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so, um, basically the house is your mom's house, right? Yeah. Okay, so it's her rule and you're just going along with her? Yeah. That if it were your house and your mom was nowhere around, you'd probably let the people have the cat? But you respect your mom for her position, right? Which means you're free. This is not your business, okay? This is an issue between your mom and her house and those people who want to have a cat. And all you could do is just convey that. And you can convey that happily. Oh, well, Mom doesn't like kittens here. I'm sure that we can find a good home. Maybe the girl who lost her cat— no, she's found it again, so that doesn't.

**Speaker B:** Work. Yeah, okay, so all three checked. None of my business.

**Speaker A:** None of your business. NMB, not my business. Your dad's bad feelings, not your business. Missing cats, not your business. Mom's house rules, not your business. And look how free and easy your life can be when things are just not your business anymore.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah, not many problems really.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there's no real problems. Every problem that we ever had is because we thought something was our business. In fact, most of that stuff, not my business. A whole lot of people think it's their business, and a whole lot of people want help with their business. But you don't have to own it. You don't have to buy.

**Speaker B:** It.

**Speaker A:** You just leave Mom's rule. Mom's got a rule: no house, no cats in the house, no animals in the house. That's the rule. If you have problems with that, go talk to Mom. Not my.

**Speaker B:** Business. But that one was interesting because it was just that part of me wanted to fight, so I made it my.

**Speaker A:** Business. Wisdom is to recognize when you're making things your business that really are not your business. Okay, Eric, well, I think that we've covered all the bases. At least the ones that are not your business. Yeah. All right, thank you for taking the.

**Speaker B:** Time to discuss all three, even though we clarified everything from the.

**Speaker A:** Beginning. Isn't that great? The Dhamma is just so simple. The complexity when we say, well, what about this and what about that What about that? Well, the same Dharma pitch, all of them.

**Speaker B:** But they are— each situation has its particularities, and like, it requires skill to work through every particular thing. Now I was just being lazy and let you do all the.

**Speaker A:** Work. I haven't done any work at all. It's not what your problems are, not my business. Okay, Eric, well, we'll see you later. Yeah, go have fun with your dad. Go have fun with your friends that have a kitten. Go have fun with your mom. All of that strife and troubles and problems are not your business. See you later.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato with a participant named Eric, centers on the theme of **"Not My Business" (NMB)** as a practical application of Buddhist wisdom to alleviate personal suffering in social situations.

### **Core Summary:**

Eric presents three scenarios where he feels conflict due to others' demands or emotional states: his estranged father's neediness, a housemate's distress over a lost cat, and a cousin wanting to break a "no pets" rule. He asks about empathy, boundaries, and how to act when feeling repulsed.

Dhammarato's guidance consistently points to one principle: **Discern what is truly "your business" and let go of the rest.** He argues that much of our stress comes from mistakenly taking ownership of other people's problems, feelings, and rules.

### **Key Teachings and Insights:**

1.  **Redefining Compassion (Karuna):** Dhammarato distinguishes Western "compassion" (jumping into the "sea of bad feelings" with someone) from true *Karuna*. True compassion is like staying on the boat and throwing a life raft to someone overboard—helping without drowning in their emotional state. Your role is to stay "high and dry" and, from a place of stability, help others if you can.

2.  **The "Not My Business" (NMB) Filter:** The central practice is to constantly investigate: "Is this mine? Is this my responsibility? Is this my problem?" For Eric's three cases:
    *   **Housemate's Cat:** The cat and the housemate's attachment/anxiety are **not his business**. He is not obligated to join her "pity party." The skillful response is to either share joy ("Don't worry, it'll come back") or, if he lacks the inner stability, to politely remove himself.
    *   **Father's Negativity:** His father's loneliness, complaints, and health are **not his business**. He cannot fix him. His "business" is to bring and maintain his own **joy** (his "mojo") into interactions. If his joy is depleted, he should skillfully take a break ("I'll be right back") and recharge. The goal is to sympathetically vibrate joy, not misery.
    *   **Cousin's Kitten:** The house rule belongs to his mother. Enforcing it is **not his business**. His conflict arose only when he *made* it his business. His role is to happily convey his mother's rule.

3.  **Sympathetic Vibration vs. Pitfalls of Empathy:** People often operate on "sympathetic vibration," unconsciously matching the emotional frequency of those around them (e.g., joining in anxiety or anger). Wisdom is learning **not** to vibrate at others' negative frequencies. Social pressure often demands we join "pity parties," but this is unskillful.

4.  **Your Only Real Business:** The only things that are truly "your business" are your **next breath, your next thought, and your next feeling.** The primary task is to "get your own mind together" through practices like Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing). From that foundation of inner well-being (*sukha*), you can then be of genuine help to others.

5.  **Practical Application:**
    *   **Investigate Ownership:** For every stressful situation, ask: "Is this I, me, or mine?"
    *   **Cultivate and Protect Your Joy:** Your inner well-being is the resource from which you operate. Protect it skillfully.
    *   **Act from Joy, Not Obligation:** If you act, do so from a desire to share joy and gladden the mind. If you can't do that, it's often wiser to step away.
    *   **Use Skillful Excuses:** When you need to disengage to regain your composure, use simple, non-confrontational excuses ("I'll be right back," "Let me check on something") rather than complicated explanations about meditation.

### **Conclusion:**

Dhammarato reframes Eric's dilemmas about empathy and boundaries as a matter of **wise discernment of ownership.** By letting go of what is "not my business"—other people's emotions, attachments, and rules—one finds immense freedom and reduces suffering. The path is to focus relentlessly on cultivating one's own joyful, mindful foundation, which then becomes the only true and effective gift one can offer to others. The Dhamma is presented as elegantly simple: complexity arises from mistakenly making everything our business.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several key **metaphors and stories** to illustrate his points about detachment, compassion, and what constitutes "our business." Here are the main ones:

### **1. The "Jumping Overboard" / "Sea of Bad Feelings" Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** The core metaphor comparing Western-style empathy to jumping into the water after someone who has fallen overboard.
*   **Purpose:** To contrast unskillful "compassion" (joining someone in their suffering) with skillful compassion (staying "high and dry" to help effectively). It illustrates that true help often means not getting emotionally drowned with the person.

### **2. The "Pity Party" Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** A recurring metaphor describing when someone is upset (e.g., over a lost cat) and others feel compelled to share and amplify that negative emotion.
*   **Purpose:** To frame shared negativity as a social event one can choose not to attend. It links to the "jumping overboard" idea and sets up the need for an alternative ("bringing joy").

### **3. The "Sympathetic Vibration" (Violin & Trumpet) Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** A story from physics: a tuned violin in a room will sympathetically vibrate and continue to sound a note after a trumpet plays that note and leaves.
*   **Purpose:** To explain how emotions are contagious. People "vibrate" at the frequency of those around them (anger, pity). The practice is to learn to maintain your own "frequency" (joy) instead of automatically matching others' negative ones.

### **4. The "Barfly / Misery Loves Company" Story**
*   **What it is:** A reference from psychology about a person in a bar who doesn't drink. The drinkers pressure him to join them to validate their own choice.
*   **Purpose:** To directly connect to the "pity party" idea. It shows that people stuck in negative states often seek company not for solutions, but for validation. Resisting this pressure is key.

### **5. The "Wagon in the Creek" Story**
*   **What it is:** A story about a wagon stuck in a creek. If 30 people push it from all different directions, they won't free it; they'll just break it.
*   **Purpose:** To illustrate why much collective action (like political activism) is often counterproductive. Everyone pushing with their own agenda creates chaos, not solutions. It's better to not engage ("not my business").

### **6. The "Thai Teenager vs. Westerner Falling Down" Anecdote**
*   **What it is:** A cultural comparison. When a Thai teenager falls, friends laugh and the person laughs it off. When a Westerner falls, people rush over with concern, often making the person feel worse.
*   **Purpose:** To provide a real-world example of how *not* making a big deal out of someone's minor misfortune (not "jumping overboard") can actually help them recover more quickly and easily.

### **7. The "Ajahn Poh / Wat Suan Mokkh" Story**
*   **What it is:** A story about the abbot Ajahn Poh, who, when presented with problems at the monastery, often did nothing, trusting others would handle it or that it wasn't his personal business to solve.
*   **Purpose:** To offer a monastic, Dhamma-based model of the "not my business" principle. It shows that effective leadership and peace can come from discerning what is truly your responsibility and what isn't.

### **8. The "Sugar / Medicine" Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** The idea that dealing with a "bitter" situation (someone's pity party) requires a huge amount of "sugar" (joy)—not just a teaspoon, but a "steam shovel full."
*   **Purpose:** To emphasize that overcoming others' strong negative emotions with your own positive state requires a robust, persistent, and abundant cultivation of joy, not just a weak attempt.

### **9. The "Promoted Beyond Competence" Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** The idea that humanity has been "promoted" from the animal kingdom to think of itself like gods, but is actually unqualified for the job, much like the Peter Principle in business (people promoted to their level of incompetence).
*   **Purpose:** To humorously reframe human suffering and meddling as a result of taking on roles and problems we are not equipped to handle. It reinforces the solution: focus on the "business" you *are* competent in (your own mind).

### **Overarching Conceptual Metaphor: "Not My Business" (NMB)**
*   **What it is:** This is the central, repeated refrain. It's presented as an acronym and a lens for investigating all of life's stressors.
*   **Purpose:** To encapsulate the entire teaching. Every problem (lost cat, dad's complaints, house rules) is filtered through this question. The investigation leads to the insight that almost nothing is truly "mine" to own or solve, leading to profound mental freedom.

These metaphors and stories work together to challenge conventional Western notions of empathy and responsibility, advocating instead for a model of compassion rooted in emotional stability, discernment, and the skillful sharing of joy rather than suffering.
