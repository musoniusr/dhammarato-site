### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. So the way to not take things personally is by first understanding that there is nothing personal, literally. So if we look at our experience, everything is happening pretty much without our choosing. So it's like happening impersonally. Like the clouds in the sky are happening naturally, so are like the thoughts in my mind. And like, uh, the feelings that I have in one moment are different from the next, and the thoughts I'm having in one moment is different from the next moment. So because, uh, I can't really find an inherent, uh, personal identity in this a mixture of causes and conditions that are constantly changing. I can't even find like, uh, the culprit for this whole person, or the culprit for the self in any part of my experience. It's always shifting and changing. So if somebody gets mad at you, or if somebody, uh, treats you a certain way, um, what they're getting— what they're essentially getting mad at is a moving target, right? So They're trying to shoot an arrow, and if you become a target for that arrow, you take it personally, you get hit by the arrow. But if you don't make yourself a target, so you don't even see yourself as an inherent self, there's nothing to hit. People are just shooting at nothing because it's not you. You just don't you don't take it personal. Um, the— there's the 8 worldly winds, or I forgot how many worldly winds, but one of the worldly winds is praise and blame and like fame and ill repute. So like one day people are gonna love you, the next they'll hate you, you know. It's just the changing like causes and conditions of the world. It's just like a Just like one day the weather's good, one day the weather's shit, right? So to let our emotions be prisoner of this changing tides of experience and the world, uh, is delusional. It's delusional because none of it is permanent or solid or, or like inherently you. Or your problem. So like, if it's not, if you can recognize it's not you, then it comes, the problem comes to an end. So any problems that you have is personal problems, right? So if nothing's personal, you have no problems. Like all problems are mentally created. All problems are constructed. So like the self is more like a process rather than an object. So the self is a function of our experience. Not in and of itself an entity. So, like, the way we interact with a world is the process of selfing. But it's only useful as a function. As soon as we carry it around as luggage or as baggage, it becomes a burden. So for example, I'm a referee when I'm wearing a white uniform and I'm standing there with my whistle. But as soon as I go, as soon as I walk out of the pool deck, I'm not a referee anymore. You know, it's a costume that I put on and off. It's the same with the idea of yourself. It's a costume that we put on and off. We put on a psychological costume to interact with other people in the world, but it's not inherently what you are because it's always changing. It's subject to change.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and the brain, like Scott was saying, is like the weather, you know, and you could do magical rain dances and stuff to try to change it. It's like there's nothing there's nothing really wrong with that. But if you think about it more logically and reasonably, when the weather comes, it's not suitable for what you would like it to be. If there's a giant storm, you just do what everybody else does. Hi, Smokey. You just take refuge in the Dhamma, take refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha, take refuge in the breath. You know, I think for a long time I had a misconception that if I just practiced spirituality and Dharma practice hard enough, I could change my biological brain to always be blissful. But I don't feel that way anymore. I see that now, that the brain is what it is. I cannot change the brain as so much as I could change the weather. The only thing I can change is my not associating myself with the brain, but rather I can choose to associate myself with a wholesome attitude and wholesome actions. Because at the end of the day, we can read all the books we want, we could read the whole Pali Canon, but we could only have control over what— I like to make the distinction between the mind and the brain. And the mind I kind of look at as like the Buddha nature mind, like the natural wisdom we all have. And when we start practicing a positive attitude, wholesome thoughts and actions, that, like Bhikkhu Dhammarato used to say, if we want to cling to an identity, that's the ultimate identity we can, we are able and should cling to, is the living Dharma. And it's a reward, you know, it starts to feel really good once you do that.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, and we should remember that all of the roles that we take on, whether it's the role that we call our job, like referee or teacher or whatever, or the role when you take on the role of being the angry person or the sad person or the happy person or the but it's all a choice. Like in that moment, we can choose to put on the costume and play that role or not.

**Speaker D:** Like.

**Speaker C:** Every day for your job, you have the choice of going and doing it or not. And every time the mind feels like it brings up the inclination towards anger or towards embarrassment or towards anything. Again, we can see it and we can choose to take it on or not. If we can see it there and then, if we can have a clear enough mind that we're able to see things as they arise, then we can choose in that moment whether to say okay and take it on or to drop it. And in the experience here, it's a lot more peaceful to just drop things and then let the mind go back to just being still.

**Speaker B:** How's it going, Smokey Joe?

**Speaker D:** What's up?

**Speaker E:** Who's that?

**Speaker B:** I'm Dhamma.

**Speaker D:** Hi, nice to meet you.

**Speaker B:** Nice to meet you. Yeah, I like to drive and listen to sometimes. Sometimes I'll even talk while I'm driving.

**Speaker D:** All the time.

**Speaker B:** Oh, hey Ivan. That Ivan?

**Speaker F:** Yeah, that's Ivan.

**Speaker B:** But yeah, over time, those thoughts, feelings, and emotions will pass. They're just passing phenomena. No need to control them or beat them into submission or cling to them. Just take refuge in the breath, breathing and relaxing, and they'll pass. And days will go by. You can spend all day doing nothing, just breathing. Watching movies, creating paintings, listening to music, but just breathing. And day after day after day— and that's why isolation can be good, because you'll start to build that wisdom and see like, oh, I have a choice. I don't have to be tangled in the spider web of society and its bullshit. I can be relaxed. I have a choice. And meditation, Sati, Anapanasati, it's not a punishment. It's actually awesome. And that's the wisdom. You start to see the benefits of it and you start to build confidence that the more you do it, the better you feel. Otherwise, what the fuck is the point of any of this? We're just going to do it and just continue to feel like.

**Speaker F:** Shit.

**Speaker B:** But you do feel better. And I'm not Mr. Perfect or anything like that. It's not a magical thing, but I can guarantee you, yeah, this doing this practice has made my life much better, much better, much more joyful.

**Speaker G:** Dhamma, I know earlier you said that you can't really change your brain. Will you— I mean, The science is pretty clear that your brain maintains a level of neuroplasticity over its life. So you can literally change the structure of your brain in meaningful ways through practicing different things throughout your life. So it's not, it's not like your brain doesn't change. It actually does. And as, as you know, often as you practice, you can make meaningful structural, like actual structural changes to your brain. I think that's one of the things that makes it, this practice, hopeful for people who have some mental disorders and whatnot. Like, they can actually make meaningful impacts that they can literally feel. It's pretty interesting, the science on neuroplasticity. I don't know it all, but I do know that it is possible So yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the brain does change like all phenomenon, but I'm more talking about making it 100% blissful all the time. I don't believe that's possible. You can get more joyful and there you could create some more neuropathways that have easier routes to take and it becomes easier and stuff like that. Sure, you can do that. But the trick is it doesn't last. You know, it doesn't last.

**Speaker D:** Right.

**Speaker G:** Well, it's just one variable in the equation.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. I think even the Dalai Lama, they asked him one time, like, do you get angry? He's like, oh yeah, I get angry.

**Speaker A:** But it's like, yeah, I'm not saying.

**Speaker G:** You can like remove all emotion or whatever. Maybe you can, I don't know who you are.

**Speaker B:** But yeah.

**Speaker D:** I think Buddha himself got like shit or shattered that his country was going to war post-enlightenment. Got pretty upset about it. Felt bad.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's a good point. And just like the Buddha too, even on his deathbed, he was experiencing Mara, but he had the wisdom to recognize Mara for what she was.

**Speaker D:** Which is.

**Speaker B:** Just a passing phenomenon that comes and goes. And that's the change I'm really talking about. I guess in a way I'm saying you can't ever get rid of the baby Dukkhas. You can't ever get rid of the dissatisfaction in the brain. But by changing our attitude towards it, in that way, we transform that Dukkha into Sukkha. And I think people— what was that?

**Speaker D:** Yusuke, the Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, the holy alchemy, changing the Dukkha into Sukkha, um, um, that we, that we can change.

**Speaker E:** Sorry to interrupt. How did we get on joyful happiness? I'm so used to hearing about contentment.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, they're sisters. It's a lot easier to be content, satisfied, and at peace. And One thing about the mind that is 100% blissed out all the time, that takes a lot of strain and effort to do that even for a short period of time. But a mind that's at peace, it still goes up and down, but it's not going down all the way into Dukkha or dissatisfaction. It's going between Piti and Sukkha, Piti and Sukkha, Piti and Sukkha. So basically we can look at this as like joy, happiness, and then there's comfort and satisfaction, and then there's joy and happiness again, and then there's comfort and satisfaction. All the while still maintaining this sort of peace or equilibrium. But there's a lot of movement there in that peace. There's a lot of motion, a lot of, you know, there's a lot going on in paradise. But then we also recognize that these things that come up, these changes that are happening, they don't need to bother us. Even if one is knocked out of Piti, Sukkha, and then they fall into Dukkha, we can say, oh, that's not a big deal, and just practice here and now once again. It's okay. And already we're flattening the mind right then and.

**Speaker D:** There. Do you ever think that every morning or every moment we're just like coming into creation and that all the memories we have are just like, you know, fake?

**Speaker F:** Yeah, I mean, memories are basically made up. Yeah. And what a lot of people will do is let their memories bother them, or they'll believe the story that their memories are telling them. Instead of just enjoying the memories. That's one thing that we can practice when memories come up. Don't be bothered by them so much. Just enjoy them the same way you might enjoy a funny video on YouTube. If there's some embarrassing memory that comes up, you can kind of gently laugh at it and say, oh, that's so silly. Not take it personally, not take it so seriously, and just move along. Take it easy.

**Speaker G:** I mean, I think memory has a function, right? There's a reason we evolved to have a memory. So to say that it's completely fabricated, I don't know if I feel like that claim has a lot of force.

**Speaker D:** It would be as delusional as any other view. What?

**Speaker G:** Sorry, what is it, Smokey?

**Speaker D:** It would be as delusional as any other view to say it is fabricated or not fabricated.

**Speaker G:** Right, I mean, you can skillfully interact with your memories. And I know for me, like, personally, I've had experiences with OCD where I have false memories, and I trained in cognitive behavioral therapy to catch those things so they don't affect me. So I know through firsthand experience of dealing with what would be complete fabrications, let's just say. Right. So I feel like there's a skillful differentiation between something that's completely fabricated or, or I guess we can just say that there's levels to the fabrication, right? It's not binary.

**Speaker D:** The levels are a choice.

**Speaker B:** Nuance?

**Speaker D:** Is that the word we're looking for?

**Speaker A:** You will always be fabricating something.

**Speaker G:** The difference is, are you intentionally fabricating something that's skillful or unskillful?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, exactly. Sorry, Jonesy, you cut out. Jonesy's mom.

**Speaker E:** Nuance. Is that the word we're looking for?

**Speaker G:** Yes, nuance.

**Speaker E:** Is that not implied by the three readings of the suttas?

**Speaker D:** That's a good word.

**Speaker G:** I haven't read this.

**Speaker E:** You know, like, like wrong view, right view with defilements, and then noble right view isn't like nuanced, implied.

**Speaker D:** It's all delusion all the way down. The person laying it out is saying that it's a more skillful delusion than the alternatives.

**Speaker E:** Um, not that I don't personally prefer to work in that framework. Um, you're already in the— don't dispute his say that that is right view with defilements?

**Speaker D:** What was your question? I'm sorry, what?

**Speaker E:** Isn't it, isn't it moha, isn't it moha, loha, dosa? That's it, right? Like, that's illusion terms.

**Speaker D:** It's, we can, you know, they're pointing towards a reality, but it's easy to confuse those things for, you know, it's like is that the reality of the situation, or is it terms that we're using to navigate it?

**Speaker G:** Right, but if you define everything as a delusion, then nothing is a delusion.

**Speaker F:** And.

**Speaker G:** Ding ding ding, right? So that's why we have to be pragmatic about it.

**Speaker D:** Who's pragmatic?

**Speaker F:** There's no perfect way to define— Enter subjectivity. Yeah, there's no perfect way to define reality. So Smokey Joe is bringing up a good point that any of the language that we use to point towards the Dhamma, point towards reality, point towards nature, there's always going to be a bit of fault there. But when we're talking about I didn't say anybody's fault.

**Speaker G:** Right, then whose is it? Is there some—.

**Speaker F:** You don't need to worry about putting blame on anyone. There's no one to blame.

**Speaker G:** But fault implies blame.

**Speaker F:** No, that's almost a Christian mindset. It's like, oh, there's sin, so therefore someone needs to be punished for it.

**Speaker G:** No, you use the word false, so it implies blame.

**Speaker E:** Okay, and sometimes there's a fault with language. It doesn't mean language is to blame about a thing. It's just a functional limitation of language.

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** That is not.

**Speaker D:** To make it all blame. Is it a functional limitation? That limitation is actually the reason we can communicate in the first place. So.

**Speaker E:** A function like putting— let's put.

**Speaker F:** Aside, let's put aside the need to blame or praise language for a moment and just see that when we're talking about right speech, what we're looking to do— yeah, it was just like my brain is going to explode. What we're looking to do is to point towards the truth in as honest of a way that we can, but we don't have to do it perfectly. It's right speech, noble speech, not perfect speech, because there, in one way, there's just, there's no way to put it perfectly that's going to summarize it for everyone. That's where practice comes into play. You have to practice Anapanasati. You have to practice Dukkha, Nirodha. You have to actually experience it, or else you're not going to see it either way, regardless of what language we use. So we could use language, we could say words like Yeah, memories are fabrications. And then there's the other view that, well, no, memories are reality. And guess what? Both can be true at the same time. Both can be false at the same time.

**Speaker D:** One could say—.

**Speaker G:** I didn't get that, Smokey. Can you say that again? I didn't hear you.

**Speaker D:** You could say there's a middle way. Middle way. Sorry.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, sure. I mean, the other way to say it is that it's a mixed bag. What we experience is both the fabrication and our reality. And so the pointing to is look at what can be changed, which is the attitude.

**Speaker G:** We can— well, I hope I'm not strawmanning, but like, I was replying to the claim that all memory is delusional, and that seemed like a big stretch.

**Speaker B:** Who said— who said that all memory is delusional?

**Speaker F:** I don't remember.

**Speaker G:** Someone said something akin to that.

**Speaker D:** They said it's very difficult as to whether things happened or not.

**Speaker C:** You see, like, I'm pretty sure he didn't say delusional. So, okay, that very memory there of what he said a few minutes back has been changed. Like, it's no longer real, it's no longer in line.

**Speaker G:** I'm asking someone to clarify what they said. I don't remember who said it.

**Speaker D:** It was me. Okay, wasn't right. I was about to tell you that, oh well, I didn't say it exactly like that, but Mr. Ben took care of it, so.

**Speaker C:** So that they are sort of like half-truths. Like, we can remember certain bits in line with how the experience was at the time, but other bits get chopped and changed and colored this way, colored that way. If we look back with an attitude that's quite bright and up, we could see the same memory in a different way to if we looked back that with an attitude of hopelessness and despair. Like, so it is like a mixed bag, like, and it's, and it's not— it's just saying memory isn't reliable. Sometimes it's more in, in line with what happened, sometimes it isn't, right?

**Speaker G:** Human memory is not perfectly functional, but it, you know, it provides some function. And like, if you want to get into like those emotional states that you're referring to that kind of contour those memories, I would say that as opposed like to the actual verifiability of said memories, which is usually dependent on like, like I was talking about, like intersubjective experiences and people corroborating the truth about something, it's like a completely different like topic is what I'm trying to point at.

**Speaker F:** We're just pointing to, can you have a happy attitude when memories come up? That's it.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Okay.

**Speaker D:** Okay.

**Speaker F:** Question right now for you, whether it's a fake memory, a completely real memory, a mixed bag of being real and fake, none of that. That's not the part that matters here. That's that the Dukkha is Are you at peace with what's going on in the mind? Are you satisfied? Are you okay? Are you saying, hey, you know what? Yeah, there's some sort of memory here. Can we be happy with it? Can we be joyful with it? Can we be happy to see it? And then can we say, yeah, that's okay, that's enough, and let it go?

**Speaker B:** And there's a sutta.

**Speaker D:** That says how to deal with taints, and I believe that it lists out that there's more than just welcoming and embracing and giving, you know, serving the thought tea. There's also the Trippi Kayo. He says that on some occasions you have to be— I mean, maybe this isn't layperson practice, but you're supposed to actually like cut them off closer to the root. And like basically like he outlines multiple different strategies and they're not always nice. Sometimes they are more what someone might call like suppression or repression, but I'm not You know, I don't really buy the whole spiritual bypassing thing anyways.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, not saying to bypass it. In fact, saying to meet it right here, right now, where it's at in the mind. Most of what we're doing with memories.

**Speaker D:** Or thoughts or whatever— spiritual bypassing is like a great term, is what I meant to say.

**Speaker F:** Oh, sure. Yeah. And then as far as what you're talking about, yes, the Buddha does also talk about there's a harder way too. So, you know, one of those recommendations, for example, is if you have a thought of wanting to kill someone that just keeps coming back up into your mind and you just cannot get rid of it, then one thing that you can do is you can clench your teeth and you can say, I will not think about this anymore.

**Speaker D:** But guess what? Mudita.

**Speaker F:** Right? That's really kind of to be left for last. It's like, first the Buddha says the soft and easy approach, you know, and then we can do— we can try a tough approach, then we can try sort of soft with the tough approach, and then we can do that killing.

**Speaker D:** Approach. Having like intrusive thoughts in the past and like OCD-type symptoms and Like, yeah, I think most of the time, like, having— being open to my feelings and accepting in the moment is like usually the case. But one big, like, piece to, like, click the puzzle sometimes was like, I, you know, like, I would just have a thought and it would just be better if I didn't, you know, just— yeah. And it was a niche situation. It's like niche situation, but I don't think I ever would have necessarily been able to, you know, negotiate it away.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, no, I'm glad you brought that up, the 4 different ways to handle a thought.

**Speaker E:** I definitely have done that too. When I already know that it's a train of thought that goes to terrible places but also triggers the mental illness, I just start singing a song instead.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, exactly. Pretty much.

**Speaker F:** That's a great, great way to deal with it. Yeah, just whistle a happy tune, sing a kuna matata. There's nothing to worry about.

**Speaker D:** As you said, Smokey.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, as you said, Smokey, it is, it is good to be able to see it early, and then we can cut it off if we, if we if we know that that path of thinking isn't beneficial and isn't wholesome, we can cut it off. The sooner we can cut it off, the better.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah. And you can even— I believe the sutta says if you get really good at it, you can start to see them arise before they arise.

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker F:** Yes, that takes repetition, essentially. And congratulations.

**Speaker D:** You catch it over and over and over again. What I, you know, there's not much of a difference between Vipassana and just having an ongoing conversation with yourself all the.

**Speaker B:** Time.

**Speaker E:** I have reached the same conclusions. I have written that essentially that exact same thing down. I loved it.

**Speaker D:** And thank you for the congratulations. I have worked a lot. I've worked really hard. I came for refuge and I was serious from day one.

**Speaker F:** So now time to take it easy.

**Speaker B:** Good, man.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, Mum.

**Speaker D:** Sorry, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** Go ahead, buddy. No, no, go ahead.

**Speaker C:** I was just going to say the practice really is simple and easy and it just does need repetition just over and over and over just realizing that everything right here and now is okay. Like, certain sound might come up, a certain sight might come up, a certain thought might come up, and if we can see them and cut them off and be like, not my problem, like, it's not— it's— it just is as it is. Like, a dog barking is just a sound that comes up. We can choose whether it— whether to let it annoy us or not. Like, we can choose to have thoughts of annoyance or just be like, ah, just a sound, not my problem. And the more we can realize that stuff isn't our problem and that really there are no problems and we can just be okay here and now, breathe in, relax in, then the easier everything gets. Just repetition.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it really is all about just having a good attitude and having wholesome actions. And what defines a good attitude or good actions is making sure that they're not causing Dukkha for ourselves or others. And I like to think of Kamma a lot with actions because, like, if we get angry And if we yell at somebody we love, we've turned that thought, feeling, and emotion into an action, into Kamma. And then we suffer the consequences both physically and mentally, along with the people around us. But think if somebody was so rude to you or so trying to push your buttons and you just remain silent. You just walked away. All the Kamma, all the negative Kamma is left on them, and you walk away scot-free, you know. And having a good attitude is the only choice we have when dealing with thoughts, feelings, and emotions. And the— I know that Dharma practice, it attracts a lot of intellectuals, it attracts a lot of artists and philosophers, and that's wonderful. But one thing I had to learn too, sometimes you have to put down the over-intellectualization of it all and see it for what it is. We're not recreating the wheel over here, you know, we're just breathing and relaxing, you know. And it's hard to be, it's hard, it's hard to become an enlightened Buddha, but it's easy to just be relaxed. Just say that good enough is okay, that this is, this is good enough.

**Speaker F:** The way it is.

**Speaker B:** That's very easy. But these preconceived notions we have of what Buddhism is, what enlightenment is, and in Thailand they just use the word Nibbana just to say, to put the food off of the fire, out of the heat, and let it cool down. And that's all we're attempting to do. The mind is always going to get a little bit hot till the day we die. It's always going to get a little bit hot. We just have to remember to take it off the fire once in a while. You know, it's a very simple, easy practice. And Dhammarato says we don't have to worry about getting it right. We just have to worry about can we get it happily. And that kind of takes away all the questions and answers, because when we're satisfied, where does all the questions and answers go? People have been philosophizing for years. You know, we've had the Library of Alexandria, now we have the internet and AI, and they're still going to keep asking questions. Watch, they're still going to keep striving.

**Speaker D:** And it's a big difference. One who really applied themselves to understanding the ideas and then really, you know, moved past them, and someone who, uh, from the get-go, you know, maybe they just decide that it's not an aid to them. And, you know, that's, that's fine if it doesn't help them. It doesn't help them. Different strokes for different folks. I think in Hinduism they say that the path, uh, the devotion path, which is like an actual codified like Vedic thing, eventually— yeah, the bhakti eventually becomes the jnana, and the jnana eventually becomes the bhakti, right?

**Speaker E:** I like what the New Age people say: take what resonates and leave what doesn't.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yes, if spinning around in circles, juggling makes you joyful and happy throughout your day, to me that's Dhamma practice. Because you ain't hurting yourself, you ain't hurting nobody. Call it by any name you want, a rose by any name, you know.

**Speaker D:** What do you mean turning around in circles? What do you mean?

**Speaker B:** I'm just giving you an example of something kind of frivolous that even if something frivolous kind of brings joy to your life, then continue it.

**Speaker D:** Philosophy is frivolous? The philosophy is frivolous? You think Nagarjuna is frivolous?

**Speaker G:** No, I think they were literally talking about spinning around. Am I wrong?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I was just talking about like spinning around in circles, like dancing or juggling.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I know what he's saying.

**Speaker B:** I'm just basically saying, like, if you're doing a wholesome action and it's leading you to be joyful, continue to do it. If it's Christianity or if it is philosophy, go for it.

**Speaker D:** Oh, maybe you don't know what wholesome is until you slow down and ask some questions.

**Speaker B:** What's that?

**Speaker D:** You don't know what wholesome is until you slow down and ask some questions.

**Speaker B:** I know what wholesome is.

**Speaker D:** Do you know what asking questions is? Yeah, that's philosophy.

**Speaker B:** Okay, and if I throw some, throw some paint on my garage, it doesn't make me Da Vinci.

**Speaker D:** Saying it does, it just makes you possible.

**Speaker B:** You know, it's just— I'm just saying to be careful not to over-intellectualize it, because if philosophy worked, there would be one— if philosophy worked, there would be one philosophy and one philosophy only, and it would be called the right way.

**Speaker D:** Well, he's very critical of other approaches, so I mean— What's that? Critical of others' approaches.

**Speaker B:** No, I just was giving an example of how I'm not critical of others' approaches. If something makes you joyful and happy, by all means keep doing it, whether it's Christianity or philosophy or whatever, you know.

**Speaker G:** Well, I guess, what do you mean by works, and why does it have to work in the way that you want it to? Like, you kind of contradicted yourself because A little bit. Um, because you said whatever, basically whatever like strokes you, like whatever gives you joy, but then you just said, well, philosophy hasn't produced any answers.

**Speaker F:** Yep.

**Speaker G:** So like, what if, what if searching for answers is what brings people joy?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm just saying it's a tool. Don't fall in love with the tool.

**Speaker A:** I think most philosophers are miserable people, man.

**Speaker D:** Well, actually, that's wrong. To say it's a tool would mean that it's a means to an end.

**Speaker A:** Have you read some of the stuff that philosophers write, dude?

**Speaker D:** Philosophy is the end in and of itself. Thoughts are the end. It's not about the answer.

**Speaker B:** What's that? Sorry, you're breaking up a little.

**Speaker D:** About the answer. It's not about the answer. So what was the last— is he.

**Speaker B:** Breaking up for anybody else?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker E:** Is it like asking questions literally like the antithesis of the point of the practice? Isn't that like the definition of craving?

**Speaker D:** I think people would like—.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, essentially what the Buddha is teaching is to, yeah, you can ask your questions. There's nothing wrong with questions. But ultimately, we're getting to a point, pointing to a point where it's like, okay, don't need to have questions anymore. Mind is at peace, everything really is okay, and we're done asking questions. So if you have questions to ask, yeah, feel free to ask them.

**Speaker G:** And when you reach the point where you have no more questions, then you're a perfect cog in the capitalist machine. At that point, you can be abused and abused.

**Speaker F:** And that's certainly not true here. But, um, well, no, I'm just responding.

**Speaker G:** To like what you said.

**Speaker E:** That would also be pretty antithetical to the, to the suttas and the Dhamma. Um, I mean, isn't the joke about how Buddhism causes you to become a beggar on the street?

**Speaker G:** I mean, no, no, no, no, I'm making a joke about how if you stop asking questions, then Buddhism, if you're.

**Speaker D:** A layperson, to go and make a bunch of money.

**Speaker B:** And keep in mind too, when we're talking about Dhamma practice, we're not setting rules for you guys. We're not saying if you do this, it's wrong, if you do this, it's right. We're just trying to establish some guidelines that you can choose to follow or not. We assume if you're on a Buddhist chat that you most likely lean towards listening to what people— What's that?

**Speaker D:** So it's, it's, uh, we've got to stay on, on Buddhism. Gotcha, gotcha. Sorry.

**Speaker B:** Well, not Buddhism. We can talk about anything, but particularly during these calls, we try to keep it around Dhamma practice, which basically has two meanings: the teaching of the Buddha or the truth of nature. So there's nothing that you can't really talk about here as long as you're being respectful. But I'm just saying, within the Dhamma practice and these Dhamma talks, we're not giving you rules. You know, we're not out to judge you. We're just giving some advice that has worked for us in our experience. And I like to say we're like a breathing and relaxing group. We could talk about philosophy. Philosophy is beautiful. I love reading philosophy books. But Dharma practice itself, to get specific, is not necessarily geared towards finding the right answers. I like Nietzsche a great deal.

**Speaker D:** What have you read of his?

**Speaker B:** I read Beyond Good and Evil. I read Thus Spoke Zarathustra. I've read The Antichrist. And I also like Marcus Aurelius. I've read his Meditations. That was a good book.

**Speaker D:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Marcus Aurelius is probably.

**Speaker B:** He said like Leo Tolstoy.

**Speaker A:** Marcus Aurelius is pretty Dhamma-filled.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, but that's not philosophy.

**Speaker B:** Tolstoy, read Confessions and Other Religious Writings, is one of the most philosophical books I've ever read.

**Speaker D:** Is it a novel? It's a novel.

**Speaker B:** It's just, it's an essay. He wrote a lot of novels. He wrote a lot of novels, but as he got older, he renounced a lot of his novels and started kind of writing more essays. But he still wrote some novels like The Death of Ivan Ilyich. This is a good book too, very philosophical. But Tolstoy, like us, kind of reached the same conclusion. That it doesn't really matter. He just set for himself in his life as an older man, he set himself some guidelines. His kind of revolved around Christianity. Ours revolve, yes, more on Buddhism, but we don't have to be crazy and like, I'm a Buddhist, I'm this, I'm that. I don't care what people call me, just as long as it's respectful. But he just reached the same conclusions, some basic guidelines to live a simple compassionate, joyful life.

**Speaker D:** I want to hear more from Mikey.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, I don't really have anything else to say. Pretty well in agreement with Dhamma Dasa here. Again, it's just highlighting again, it's about putting down the questions. At the end of the day. It's like bringing the mind to peace, to joy, you know, a mind that's satisfied, a mind that's really full of joy, a mind that's really at peace, recognizes there's nothing left to question. There's no desire or craving or need to know what to do, or to know how things work, or to really know anything at all. There's no need to know if a memory, for example, is real or fake. The mind can just say, it doesn't really matter. We're at peace now, things are okay. Let's just take it easy. And again, so much of this practice, like Dhammarato was saying as well, is it's like, we're bringing it back to the breath. You know, we're reinvigorating ourselves and we're saying, okay, you know, yeah, these questions are great. Even, you know, all these things that we were talking about are great. It's great to talk with friends and to smile with one another, but let's not forget the breath. So take a moment now to look at your breath. And see, are you breathing comfortably right now? Are you bringing a nurturing breath to the body? What's a way to breathe that would feel really nice and enjoyable and pleasant? Because if you're not doing that, then all of this that we're talking about doesn't really matter anyways.

**Speaker C:** Don't believe me, practice and find out for yourself.

**Speaker F:** Amen.

**Speaker C:** Like, if you find that— Appeal to.

**Speaker G:** Authority, confirmation bias, and—.

**Speaker A:** Can you just let him finish?

**Speaker G:** I'm sorry, I was telling a joke.

**Speaker C:** Throw some more labels if you want, it's all good.

**Speaker G:** I'm joking, I'm joking, I'm sorry.

**Speaker D:** I'm just saying, Ben was mid-sentence.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, so it's all about the practice. It's all about experiential practice. Like, if you find that getting into philosophy and reading certain things brings peace and contentment to existence, then that's experience for you and it's all good. If you find that it doesn't and it brings up restlessness and questions and constantly searching and wanting more answers and more answers and more answers, then you can drop it. You don't have to keep doing it. And that's all the practice is, realizing what is wholesome, what brings peace, contentment, stillness, calmness, and what doesn't. And realizing we have the power in every moment to drop things that bring us out of that state.

**Speaker D:** The OG suttas refer to it as questions not tending to edification. He gives 20 examples of them, but I think the point is that there are more than 20 questions not tending to edification.

**Speaker G:** What does that mean, Smokey?

**Speaker D:** Like It's not going to get you further on the path. It might, but it's not directly the thing that is going to cultivate your peace of mind. But it's, you know, A to B to, you know, it's— yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker F:** The easy question to ask is, is there dissatisfaction right now? Is there stress? Is there discontentment? Is there upsetness? And then when we see that, we can congratulate ourselves for seeing that in the mind and get out of it. Yeah, is there craving? Thank you, Ivan. Is there wanting what we don't have? Then let's make a change. Let's do it with enthusiasm and joy. And let's say we don't need that right now. We don't need to be bothered by that. Yeah, things really are okay. Bring the mind and body to peace. For now, friends, I have to go, but this has been really nice being here today. Oh, take care. Thanks, Mikey.

**Speaker B:** Oh, thank you, Mikey.

**Speaker A:** I enjoyed your talk.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, I enjoyed being here.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato and Sangha friends, revolves around the core Buddhist teaching of **non-self (anattā)** and how to apply it to daily life to reduce suffering. Here is a summary of the key points discussed:

### **Main Themes**

1. **Nothing is Personal**  
   - All experiences—thoughts, feelings, external events—arise due to causes and conditions, like clouds moving across the sky. There is no fixed, permanent "self" to take things personally.  
   - When someone criticizes or blames you, they are aiming at "a moving target." If you don’t identify as a solid self, there is nothing for the arrow of blame to hit.

2. **The Self as a Process, Not an Entity**  
   - The self is better understood as a **function** or a **costume** we put on to interact with the world—like a referee wearing a uniform. It’s useful but not who we inherently are.  
   - Clinging to a fixed identity creates baggage and suffering.

3. **Finding Refuge in the Present Moment**  
   - Instead of trying to control changing conditions (like the weather or the brain’s natural fluctuations), take refuge in the **breath**, the **Dhamma**, and a **wholesome attitude**.  
   - The goal isn’t to achieve permanent bliss, but to cultivate peace and equilibrium amid life’s ups and downs.

4. **Choice and Attitude in Experience**  
   - We can choose how to relate to thoughts, emotions, and social roles. Seeing them early allows us to either engage skillfully or let them go.  
   - **Wholesome actions** are those that reduce suffering for oneself and others. Unwholesome actions (like reacting with anger) create negative kamma.

5. **The Role of Practice**  
   - The practice is simple: **breathe, relax, and observe** without identifying with passing phenomena.  
   - It’s about repetition—returning again and again to a peaceful, non-reactive awareness.  
   - Intellectualizing can sometimes distract from direct experience. The emphasis is on **experiential understanding** rather than philosophical debate.

6. **Handling Difficult Thoughts and Memories**  
   - Memories are not perfectly reliable; they are often mixed with fabrication. The key is not whether they are "true," but whether we can meet them with a **peaceful, happy attitude**.  
   - The Buddha offered multiple strategies for dealing with persistent unwholesome thoughts—from gentle acknowledgment to firm suppression if necessary.

7. **The End of Questions**  
   - While questioning has its place, the ultimate aim of practice is to reach a state of contentment where questions naturally subside because the mind is at peace.  
   - The Dhamma is presented as a set of **guidelines, not rigid rules**, encouraging each person to find what brings genuine joy and reduces suffering.

### **Overall Tone**
The conversation is friendly, practical, and down-to-earth. The speakers encourage **ease, repetition, and kindness** toward oneself. They stress that the path is about **"getting it happily"** rather than perfectly, and that peace is found in letting go of identification with the ever-changing flow of experience.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several core metaphors and stories to explain Buddhist concepts related to non-attachment, the nature of self, and mental practice. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Key Metaphors and Stories**

**1. The Weather / Clouds in the Sky**
   - **Speaker A:** Compares thoughts and feelings to clouds in the sky—natural, impersonal, and constantly changing.
   - **Speaker B:** Likens the brain to the weather—unpredictable and not fully controllable. You can’t stop a storm, but you can “take refuge” (in the Dhamma, breath, etc.) until it passes.

**2. The Arrow and the Moving Target**
   - **Speaker A:** Uses the metaphor of someone shooting an arrow of anger at you. If you see yourself as a fixed target (a solid self), you get hit (take it personally). If you recognize there’s no fixed self—just a “moving target” of changing conditions—the arrow hits nothing. You don’t make yourself a target.

**3. The Costume / Role**
   - **Speaker A & C:** Compare the self to a costume or uniform (e.g., a referee’s uniform) that you put on and take off. Identities (referee, angry person, happy person) are roles we play, not inherent, permanent selves.

**4. Luggage or Baggage**
   - **Speaker A:** Suggests that if we carry the self around like heavy luggage (as a fixed entity), it becomes a burden. It should be seen as a useful function, not a permanent object.

**5. The 8 Worldly Winds**
   - **Speaker A:** References the Buddhist teaching of the “worldly winds” (e.g., praise and blame, fame and ill repute). Like changing weather, these external conditions naturally fluctuate—it’s delusional to let our emotions be tossed by them.

**6. Taking Refuge from the Storm**
   - **Speaker B:** Extends the weather metaphor: when a “giant storm” (mental turmoil, difficult conditions) comes, you don’t try to control it with “magical rain dances.” Instead, you take refuge in the Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha, or the breath.

**7. Alchemy: Transforming Dukkha into Sukkha**
   - **Speaker B:** Presents the idea of “holy alchemy”—not eliminating suffering (dukkha) but changing our attitude toward it to transform it into peace or happiness (sukkha).

**8. Spider Web of Society**
   - **Speaker B:** Describes entanglement in social expectations and “bullshit” as being caught in a spider web. Isolation or meditation can help you see you have a choice to be relaxed and free.

**9. Memories as YouTube Videos / Fabrications**
   - **Speaker F:** Suggests treating memories like funny YouTube videos—something to observe, maybe enjoy, but not believe or be bothered by. Memories are “basically made up” or at least unreliable narratives.

**10. Putting Food Off the Fire / Letting It Cool**
   - **Speaker B:** Uses the Thai interpretation of Nibbana (Nirvana) as taking food off the fire to cool it down. The mind will always get “a little hot,” but the practice is about cooling it down repeatedly.

**11. The Four Ways to Handle a Thought (from the Suttas)**
   - **Speaker D & F:** Reference the Buddha’s strategies for dealing with unwholesome thoughts, ranging from gentle (replacing with a wholesome thought) to forceful (clenching teeth and suppressing it)—analogous to dealing with intrusive thoughts or OCD.

**12. Philosophy as a Tool (Not an End)**
   - **Speaker B:** Warns against “over-intellectualization.” Philosophy is a tool, but don’t “fall in love with the tool.” The goal is peace, not endless questioning.

**13. Breathing and Relaxing as the Core Simplicity**
   - Multiple speakers return to the metaphor that practice is simply “breathing and relaxing”—a natural, easy process, not about recreating the wheel or achieving perfect bliss.

### **Implied Stories / Anecdotes**
- **The Buddha’s Final Days:** Speaker B mentions that even the Buddha experienced Mara (temptation/illusion) on his deathbed but had the wisdom to recognize it as a passing phenomenon.
- **The Dalai Lama Gets Angry:** Cited as an example that even advanced practitioners don’t eliminate emotions—they change their relationship to them.
- **Tolstoy’s Late-Life Essays:** Speaker B references Tolstoy’s turn toward simple, compassionate guidelines in his later years, similar to Dhamma practice.

These metaphors and stories collectively emphasize **impersonality, impermanence, and the possibility of peace through non-identification and simple, mindful practice.**
