### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Start the recording. So this is good. I'm really glad that you're, um, uh, talking to us like this.

**Speaker B:** Uh, you should, um— It's Isaiah. No, no problem.

**Speaker A:** Anyway, yeah, how do you say your name?

**Speaker B:** Isaiah.

**Speaker A:** Isaiah. Yes. Okay, Isaiah. All right. Um, so I'm really pleased to hear that you're practicing correctly, that you're practicing well, and you're getting the benefit out of it. This is really something that, uh, beginners should be able to hear because so many of us think that it's a whole lot of work.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** I've been there. It's not. No. And that feeling of wealthiness, that feeling of we've got everything that we need, I mean, we really do have it, a feeling of overflowing, is basically that's the practice, to come to that state. It makes it really valuable. So I want to first off to say congratulations. And the next point is, is that this is a skill that must be developed. That one of the things that happens quite often, we can put it into the— let us say, make the statement of beginner's luck. Beginner's luck is actually what everyone should have, but what happens with beginner is that when they do get lucky and do get practice and think about, oh well, this really is easy, then we stop practicing. We think we've already got it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that then it will last for a little while, but then the old ways start coming back in, that we have to remember over and over again that we've got a choice here, and that we can feel the way that we want to feel. And so that's the number one recommendation, is don't quit.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yes, ring the bells, don't quit.

**Speaker A:** Don't quit, keep practicing because you can see how valuable it is. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And what was really helpful was actually one of Scott's Dharma talks with the weekly Sangha when he said that there was no such thing as past Dukkha. And I was like, boom, light bulb! Yeah, I'm making it right now. Like, all the past good feelings, they don't matter. If I could just take control, take a deep breath, and feel alive right now, that how good I felt in the past, forget about it, doesn't matter. How bad I felt in the past, forget about it, doesn't matter. How I will feel in the future. So I really like that little bit that he said. I was like, it really clicked.

**Speaker A:** That in fact, we've already established a habit. In the past, we established that habit of having a particular experience or a particular memory and feeling bad, and so the next time that we have that particular experience or that particular memory, then the habit of the bad feelings of it the Dukkha of it, come right along. And it takes an extra amount of— a little bit of extra amount of effort to break that up. The memory and the bad feelings that go with that memory can be separated. Yeah, so that we don't have to feel the way that we used to feel when we're doing the things that we used to do, because we haven't come out of that yet. So we still do those things, but now we have a new choice in this moment to change the way that we feel about it. Yeah, that's just so remarkable because very few people get to the point of understanding that they actually are in charge of their feelings. You can feel the way that you want to feel.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and it's almost like going back It's too much work. It's like, it's like, it's like, nope, I don't want to feel that way, buddy. Like, no thank you. I'm gonna feel like a champ right now.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. Yeah. So do you have any questions?

**Speaker B:** No, I guess I've just come to appreciate more, more like a statement now. I guess I've come to appreciate more the Sangha now, because it's like, well, once you feel good, you just want to feel good with other people. Or it's not really a want, but like, you just like, just, you know, like, I don't want to hang around people who just— who are bummers, you know, Debbie Downers. And, um, so I've come to appreciate that a lot more.

**Speaker A:** Very, very good. Very good. Well, I've got another caller coming. This has only been a very short call, but this is possibly one of the best calls I've had all week.

**Speaker B:** All right, all right.

**Speaker A:** So keep going, keep, keep practicing, check in, come to me from time to time to let me know how you're going. But that's the important point, is rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat. Keep doing this.

**Speaker B:** The Dhamma, the shampoo bottle, is magnificent. Yeah, all right, Dhammarato. Well, I know you're having a good moment.

**Speaker A:** I really am pleased that you're practicing well. Thank you.

**Speaker B:** All right, bye.

**Speaker A:** Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points:

**Core Theme:** The ease and immediate accessibility of genuine meditation practice, and the importance of consistent skill development to maintain it.

**Main Points:**

1.  **Correct Practice is Simple & Rewarding:** The teacher (Dhammarato, Speaker A) congratulates Isaiah (Speaker B) for practicing correctly, emphasizing that the goal is a feeling of "wealthiness," sufficiency, and overflowing happiness. He notes that beginners often mistakenly think it requires "a whole lot of work."

2.  **The Danger of "Beginner's Luck" & The Key is Non-Quitting:** The initial success (like "beginner's luck") can lead to complacency. When the good feeling fades and old habits return, the crucial instruction is **"don't quit."** The practice is a skill that must be continually developed through repetition ("rinse and repeat").

3.  **You Are in Charge of Your Feelings Now:** A pivotal insight for Isaiah was the understanding that **there is no "past *dukkha*" (suffering/stress)**—it is created in the present moment. We have a habitual pairing of memories/experiences with negative feelings, but that link can be broken. In any moment, we can choose to feel differently: "You can feel the way that you want to feel."

4.  **The Value of Sangha (Community):** As one's practice deepens and well-being increases, there is a natural appreciation for the spiritual community (Sangha). One begins to value supportive company and finds less interest in being around consistently negative influences ("Debbie Downers").

**Overall Tone:** Encouraging, celebratory, and practical. The dialogue is a positive reinforcement of correct understanding, focusing on present-moment agency and the necessity of persistent, joyful practice.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the dialogue, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used in the talk:

### Metaphors:
1.  **"Feeling of wealthiness" / "Feeling of overflowing"**: Used to describe the positive, abundant state of mind that is the goal of the practice—a sense that you already have everything you need.
2.  **"Beginner's luck"**: Used as a cautionary metaphor. It describes the initial, easy success in practice, which can be misleading and cause a person to stop practicing, thinking they've already achieved the goal.
3.  **"Ring the bells"**: This is a celebratory or affirming metaphor (from Speaker B) emphasizing the importance of the advice **"don't quit."**
4.  **"Rinse and repeat"**: This is the primary, extended metaphor introduced by Speaker A at the end. It compares the ongoing practice of mindfulness and choosing one's feelings to the instructions on a shampoo bottle. The meaning is that you must continually and repeatedly apply the practice, just as you repeatedly wash and rinse your hair.
5.  **"The Dhamma, the shampoo bottle"**: Speaker B humorously completes the metaphor, explicitly linking the teaching (Dhamma) to the "rinse and repeat" instruction, calling it "magnificent."
6.  **"Light bulb!"**: A common metaphor for a sudden moment of understanding or clarity, which Speaker B uses to describe hearing the teaching about "past *Dukkha*."
7.  **"Feel like a champ"**: A metaphorical phrase used by Speaker B to describe consciously choosing a powerful, positive feeling over a negative one.

### Stories / Anecdotes:
1.  **The Story of "Past Dukkha"**: Speaker B recounts a key teaching from **Scott's Dharma talk**. The story/teaching is that **"there is no such thing as past *Dukkha*"** (suffering, stress). The insight is that we create our suffering *in the present moment* by how we relate to memories or anticipations. This story was the pivotal "light bulb" moment for Speaker B.
2.  **The Habit Loop Story**: Speaker A elaborates on a common psychological story or pattern: In the past, we formed a **habit** of linking a specific memory or experience with bad feelings. Now, when that memory arises, the old bad feelings automatically follow. The practice is the story of breaking that automatic link and inserting a new choice.
3.  **The Narrative of "Don't Quit"**: While not a single story, the speakers co-create a **narrative arc** about the common journey in practice: beginner's luck -> the trap of stopping -> the return of old patterns -> the necessity of persistent practice ("don't quit") to make the new skill permanent.

**In summary**, the conversation uses metaphors of **abundance, misleading luck, repetitive care (rinse/repeat), and sudden insight** to frame the personal stories of **habit formation, pivotal teachings from a teacher, and the ongoing narrative of the practitioner's path.** The "rinse and repeat" shampoo metaphor is the most developed and memorable figurative device in the talk.
