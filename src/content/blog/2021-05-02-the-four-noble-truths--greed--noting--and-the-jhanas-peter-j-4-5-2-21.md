### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Well, Peter, I'm really glad to hear that you've made a change in your practice. Tell me a little more about it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, well, Bhante and I, we were talking about three things the last time, which were right view, and secondly about Sati and right effort, and What I recognized is that in my practice, where right effort was missing, and I was just being aware of what I'm doing, and always, or most of the time, being just aware what is going on in the present moment, but I didn't really find a way to handle bad situations. And last time what I've learned is that how to handle with unwholesome thoughts and bringing up awesome thoughts, which was basically right effort we were talking about. And yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so you're getting immediate results?

**Speaker A:** I think so, hopefully.

**Speaker B:** Well, no, it's not hopefully and think so like in the future. You already can experience it right now.

**Speaker A:** So then I would definitely say yes, I'm making progress.

**Speaker B:** That what you were actually kind of indicating was that it almost feels too good to be true.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, definitely. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And yet, you know, it's true. You're experiencing it directly. Okay. Okay. This is exactly what we mean when the Buddha talks about it. And this little phrase that I'm about to say is so profoundly important. And that it is in many places throughout the suttas. The most famous place it is in is the Dhammapada, but it is in throughout the Mahayana. It is also in some of the very ancient literature. So this is something that has been done all along, and that is that the Buddha says that his teaching is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, especially when it's said with the right meanings, phrasing, and timing so that the students get it correctly. If they get it correctly, then it really is good right from the very beginning. And so that actually then answers immediately that huge, huge nagging question of, in Western Buddhism, Why do some people think that meditation is potentially dangerous? Hmm. Okay. Or why do you have actually rescue squads of people who were there to help people? And when I mean the rescue squad, I'm talking about, one, the volunteers at retreats. Number two, there are websites that have whole groups of psychologists who specialize in helping people get out of the mess that they've gotten into with meditation.

**Speaker A:** I see.

**Speaker B:** Okay. And the reason for that is because it's so often practiced the way that you had been practicing before, in the sense of noting and noticing or being aware, having choiceless awareness, and just living in the mess that we've made. Yes, right, as if living in the mess that we've made is going to clean up the mess. Or in the sense of an animal that's caged in too tight a place, or other situations to where the animal will spoil its own nest. And then that's the only thing that they know how to do. And so this is what humans do on at least a mental level. It's interesting that we talk about hygiene and physical hygiene, and they even talk about mental hygiene, and they don't really understand that what mental hygiene is all about— taking a bath, taking a mental bath. That's in fact, taking a bath is 90% of all physical hygiene. If you've got a dirty body, it's going to get sick. And in fact, they know that exactly, that that was the cause of leprosy, is not washing. Okay. And so we live in a very clean environment now to where we wash, not just wash our bodies, but we wash our clothes, we wash our cars, we just wash and wash. But 500 years ago, especially in cold climates, they thought that it was somehow unhealthy to have a bath.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I didn't know that.

**Speaker B:** That was especially true of sailors. If you're a sailor and you have a choice of either taking a saltwater bath or no bath at all, generally the no bath at all is the better. That in fact, if you've ever been swimming in the ocean, what's the first thing you do after you get out of the ocean? You just had a bath in the ocean. What's the first thing you do? You take a bath. Yeah, fresh water. You get under the shower and you get all that salt off. Yeah. Okay. So in this regard, we're talking about that the very first thing we do in Buddhism is take a mental bath. We take a bath and we figure out that that's actually the most important thing that there is to do, is to keep the mind clean, to take the bath, which means to take the unwholesome thoughts out. There's something that can be put together. In one place I saw on Reddit that there was a group that was asking a question, and the question is, what is something that is really dangerous but that people do not perceive it as danger? Okay, and so the answer to that obviously is unwholesome thoughts, because people think that my thoughts are my thoughts and they're okay. That in fact, there is a group of, or a pair of stage magicians, Penn and Teller, that's very famous. And Penn has said, in the sense of free speech and actions, that he thinks that it doesn't matter what he thinks, so long as he doesn't behave and he doesn't act, he's OK. Now that goes exactly along with the old Brahman system that said that action is like carving into stone. That if you commit an act, if you hurt somebody, if you break their arm or something like that, that's really strong things to do, to where wrong speech then would be like writing in the sand. That that can be protected, but more than likely it will fade away, to where wrong thought is like writing in the air or writing on the water. In other words, it doesn't have much value. The Buddha says exactly backwards, and that is that the mind is the forerunner. The mind controls everything. We just don't realize that. And so if we have a spark of a bad thought about someone and set something in motion, we can actually— just a spark can wind up getting someone killed. Okay. An example of that is, is that when the cop stops you, if you show him even a spark of anger, that's going to escalate to the point you got to get shot. Okay, yeah, all right. So, but the anger that you would distribute to a cop would already be anger that you built up in the mind. You're already pissed at him just before he even told you to roll down the window.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, definitely. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so this is the reason why, uh, beginning to work from the very beginning in meditation is the very first and really most important thing that's to be done. Is to bring our mind out of unwholesome states into wholesome states. Yeah, which would be another way of thinking is, is coming out of the kinds of thoughts that can possibly lead to Dukkha. All right, this is an important point because what I'm looking at is, is that there is a kind of thought that is wholesome because it's nurturing in the sense of everything is okay, everything is all right, nothing is broken. Let the sleeping dog lie. If it's not broke, don't fix it. Okay, versus the way that our society is built is this hubble is too strong, too small, and it's dangerous. I need a bigger house. We don't need a village, we need a city. Okay, we don't need to yell at each other, we need telephones. First the crank kind and then the push-button kind, and now the cell phones. But it's always more and better and better because we can compare. I like this, but I like this better, and because I like this better, I don't like this so much. Okay, this is a comparative mind, which we can also use labels like a judgmental mind, but a better way of looking at it is by using it in the sense of a critical mind, that we think critically. Yeah, well, now you know where the word critic, critical comes from. You know what critic means? Oh, that the same word is to criticize. All right, that in fact, if you're going to say that building is tall, you have to compare it to something that's not. Okay, and so this is where the idea of criticism is, is this drawing boundaries, making distinctions, and liking this and not liking that, and making these boundaries and distinctions ignorantly. And now we have a classic definition of the Second Noble Truth. Wanting things or wanting to get rid of things that is based upon a feeling that we're ignorant of. And that ignorant feeling is, I like it, and I like it means I want it, and if I like it and want it, that makes it good. And if I don't like it and I'm trying to get rid of it, that means I think it's evil. And there's the birth of good and evil based upon what we like and don't like rather than out of wisdom about making sure under investigation that this is in fact right and this is in fact not right.

**Speaker A:** I have a question to that.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And during my— during our last— or during the time to our last talk, I had many situations which were very stressful. And is it the right way to handle it like this, that you recognize that there's stress and that you put up something wholesome like relax or putting up Metta or something else.

**Speaker B:** Certainly.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So this was the way I handled very many, many situations during the last time.

**Speaker B:** Well, what that just means is that you find many opportunities to stress yourself out, and now you're beginning to notice that you're stressing yourself out, and you've got a new tool that you can unstress yourself Congratulations. This is a new skill that you're developing right here and now that you're taking great benefit from. But if you were only noting the stress, then you're just going to see a lot of stress. But now you're seeing a lot of success.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, definitely. I found that this was the essence of our last talk. So it was very helpful, definitely.

**Speaker B:** Well, this is the essence of the Buddhist teaching of the Buddha, is that we have these judgmental thoughts, these critical thoughts. We criticize ourselves. And in fact, that's how you got yourself stressed out, put yourself into stress, is by criticizing things. And how you get yourself out of stress is by coming out of the stressing criticism into the wholesome nurturing thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And you could have been doing that all along if you'd only realized that that was a big problem and you thought that the stress was coming from the situation.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, could have prevented me from, from very much stressful situations. Definitely.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the situation is never stressful. Yeah, it's the, it's the situationer. Or the person there, or the self. When we become selfish, then we put ourselves into the situation in danger. That's the stress, that this is me on the line here. Yeah, but when we're not selfish about it, when you say, okay, it's just a situation, let's see what happens.

**Speaker A:** Definitely. Yeah. And it's so easy.

**Speaker B:** It feels easy now, but you have to practice that. You have to practice changing the mind. Yeah, that in a way, if you want to use this kind of language, then that's the real letting go. But this letting go is not merely, let us say, letting gravity do all the work so that we let it go like that. Yeah, it doesn't work like that. It's much more like letting it go means— it's much more like that. There's some effort in it. Why is there effort in it? Is because really what's going on is that we were clinging and holding to it because we thought that there was some advantage to that, that there is in fact gratification. We only have the idea of wanting to let it go once we begin to see the danger in it, when we begin to see the Dukkha. Only then are we willing to let it go, but there's still resistance built in. And so that's why that first group of times, it does sometimes take a lot of effort. To let go of those unwholesome thoughts and to bring about and bring the mind back wholesome again. But once we get into that habit, once we can control the mind and keep only wholesome thoughts in, then that's most of the work that needs to be done. That's why the Buddha talks about it in so many suttas. I can name you so many that have in various different ways, for instance, in the sutta about the Eightfold Noble Path, he talks about one's right effort in the sense of one's right effort is to change our view from unwholesome to wholesome view and to change our thoughts from unwholesome to wholesome thoughts. And at that level, he's also talking about it from changing our attitude from an unwholesome attitude into a wholesome attitude. This is one's right effort. But at a moment-by-moment level, this is what we call hindrances, or the thoughts that would hinder us from being in a really wholesome, happy state.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay. And so these are the thoughts that come up, and that's where we have to take the right effort, Dan, is to remove those thoughts and replace them with wholesome thoughts. And like I said, sometimes that takes some work. That takes some effort to do. And sometimes thoughts get really, really persistent, and it feels kind of like a challenge, to where in fact, it's not that they're persistent, and it's not so much of a challenge. The real issue is that they come back again because we invited them back because we like them again. Yeah, but we do that ignorantly. So now we're waking up. So when we wake up to the fact that here that old thought is back again, I can say, aha, I caught you again. Yeah, there you are again. And so we begin more and more to congratulate ourselves for the fact that we can wake up. In the very beginning, many meditators, especially at the Goenka retreat— and Goenka will say, watch your breath. And then he'll say, "If the mind wanders away from the breath, never mind, start again." And that phrase has become very, very famous: "Never mind, start again." And why? Because people don't do that. They do mind, they mind very much that the mind has wandered away, they don't like it a bit, and they start screaming monkey mind, and they start saying meditation is hard. Yeah, right. So that, that's, that just fits in with our old style. But when we recognize, oh no, this is time to congratulate ourselves, this is really the time to never mind, start again, to drop the fact that the mind has wandered away from the breath into hindrances, we can come back again and put only wholesome thoughts in the mind. Yeah, over and over and over again we do this and we gladden the mind and say, hot dog, I can do this, and hot dog, I can do that. And this is what then builds in the fourth ingredient in the Eightfold Noble Path. Last time we talked about, uh, right view, right remembering, and right effort. Once we start doing that, we begin to build on it. And these things run in circle around each other so that one's right effort increases our right view, and our right view and our right effort helps build up the Sati. And so we remember better and it gets the ball rolling. And when we get this tricycle off going, now we add a fourth wheel to it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And that fourth wheel then is the Samma Sanghappa, and that means now that we have already gotten the thing rolling, we know it works. But we're now— we're going to kick it into high gear, is another way of saying it, is because we're going to add this can-do attitude to it. Hot dog, we can do this! So that then we come to the position, hey, it doesn't matter how much that mind gets clouded up with hindrances or how long I let it, as soon as I remember, I can pop that stuff right out of the mind and I can come right into the present moment. Yeah, that's an important point.

**Speaker A:** I definitely recognized that because I feel that during right effort, my awareness changed. Like the time, or during my time before our last talk, I was more on autopilot than on being aware because I was just thinking I'm riding my bike or I'm feeling a bad feeling. And and it became more on autopilot. And now, through right effort, I recognize that I'm much more aware in grabbing the bad thoughts and handling them in the right way. So like you say, it's like a wheel, if I got you right.

**Speaker B:** Right. Or let us say it's a positive feedback system, or a positive feedback loop. Means that once the ball gets rolling, it continues to roll, just like an avalanche. An avalanche is a positive feedback system, or even rolling a snowball down the hill, and that snowball will grow in size as it goes down the hill. This is exactly like that. That's why one's right effort, that is effort in the beginning, winds up being unremitting energy, so that you become exuberant. That's part of the Seven Factors of Enlightenment, is this effervescence or exuberance, or overflowing of energy that got started from one's right effort of changing the mind from unwholesome to wholesome. So, it's also rooted, that energy has an extra kick to it, because it's not the energy that one puts in from the perspective of, or the position of a victim, or a loser, or one who is, let us say, capable of it only at great expense. Rather, we're of the opinion, or of the life position, or the attitude, is that this is easy! This is a piece of cake, I can handle this, this is all right, there's nothing problem here. OK, so now we're changing the whole attitude from the attitude of the victim, into the attitude of a winner, from the attitude of this is hard work into, wow, this is a piece of cake.

**Speaker A:** I get it.

**Speaker B:** Okay. And that attitude also is that attitude that I mentioned just before. And the Buddha makes a big point about this, and that is, is that understanding what obstructions or hindrances are of the mind and knowing what is wholesome and unwholesome in that regard that it doesn't matter how much unwholesomeness I have to deal with, I can throw that stuff out and bring myself back into the winner's position so that I can handle this. Okay, okay. Now, uh, so the cop stops me, and after a flash of anger— and I can get myself really angry, I've been angry— but I can also catch it, and I say, hey, I don't have to be angry. This is not a good time to be angry, not with this cop. Let's get the mojo flowing. Let's get our good attitude going. Let's deal with this guy. Let's say, yes, sir, I'll do anything you want, sir. Okay. No, but the reason that cops have so much trouble is because when the cops stop them, everyone is either in fear are in fear-motivated anger, and the cops want to present themselves as powerful. All right, all right. But the cop would just as soon be powerful among friends who just accept him in his powerful position, rather than people who are like this, because when we're like this, we might do that, you know. Yeah. So this is why being in a really good spirit with people when you're in tense situations takes all the tension out of it, not just for you but for him also.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I see. It's like a backbiting dog.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. You know, dogs are very good at that. They know what fear is. I've seen that. I've proved that myself many times since I heard it when I was young. And that is, dogs only bark at people who are afraid of them. If the people are not afraid of the dog, like the people have been at the house before and they know the dog, the dog is not— maybe not even remember whether this person's been here before, but the person himself will tell the dog whether the person thinks he belongs here or not. Yeah. And if the person says, I don't belong here, then the dog will say, you're right, you don't. And yet some people who are around dogs and know dogs about this, they put their hand out and they say, "Hi, dog," and the dog says hi back.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, surely.

**Speaker B:** Okay, guess what? In that regard, not taking the analogy too far, but that same situation is with the cops too. Yeah, if you're very friendly with them, they'll be friendly back. If you act afraid of them, they're going to bark at you. Yeah. All right, so what we're saying here is that we do create our own reality. In that regard, we create our own reality all the time. So, if you go around creating for yourself on a moment-by-moment wholesome, happy, safe reality, then your reality will be safe and happy.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So you are the creator of just being a victim?

**Speaker B:** You are the creator of your own reality and always have been, but now we can begin to see it through waking up, but it's not just the waking up. But it's the waking up to the fact that we can control it, we can manipulate it, that you are in fact the boss of your life if you take control. Yeah, if you take control, then that it belongs to you. Until then, it's the boss of you. And so people go around in bad feelings being controlled by those bad feelings. Yeah, but once you recognize that you are in fact able to control your bad feelings through your own thoughts, then you can control the way that you feel. And now you can live the way that you want to live, feel the way you want to feel. Yeah, that's the secret to the teaching of the Buddha. And it all has to go back to that taking the right effort to change the mind, and then we get really good at it. And so we know for sure beyond a shadow of a doubt that this is the path of the Buddha.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. The last time you put up the example of the snake you are grabbing by hand and handle it in the right way. And this is what I feel right now is like you talking about taking control of your life. And this I really felt during the last time, definitely during everyday life, but also doing meditation.

**Speaker B:** Isn't that interesting? Because a lot of people talk about the Eightfold Noble Path of the Buddha, and they don't recognize how profound this is, is a method of actually taking control of your life so that you can avoid the dangers and difficulties and come right out of your own Dukkha. Yeah, it's profound. It's so powerful. It's so strong. And yet by the time it's taught to the kids, it's kind of wishy-washy. It's kind of stuff that you put up on the blackboard for them to write down so that they can memorize it. And the funny part of it is, is that so many people get it wrong right from the get-go. They will say, oh, the First Noble Truth, life is suffering, and they've already made a huge mistake.

**Speaker A:** I don't really get that. Can you explain?

**Speaker B:** Because life is not suffering, life is just life. Life is what you make of it.

**Speaker A:** So it's more like this.

**Speaker B:** The right way to state it is just there is suffering, it does exist, but there's no reason for it to exist. Okay, but it does have a cause. It does exist. And then we recognize, oh, the real reason why it exists is because we're too stupid to recognize that we're doing stupid things. Yeah, but when we wake up and investigate, we can recognize, no, there is very wholesome ways of doing things. That do not create disasters, and that the biggest one of all is basically wanting things that we don't have. And when we see people and hear about people who are in the state of not wanting things that they don't have, then they say, oh, I want to be like that. Let me do some meditation so I can become enlightened too. Surely. And so off they go into a practice of enlightenment that's built upon greed, missing the Second Noble Truth completely. This is why we have to teach it in certain— in just a certain way, so that people begin to see that what is suffering is things that we make in the mind, having unwholesome thoughts like wanting something that we don't have. But a more wholesome thought would be, you've already got what you need. You're okay. Everything is fine.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Isn't that interesting? It's just a matter of the way that we talk to ourselves based upon the attitude. And we start off with the attitude of a loser, someone who needs something, someone who is missing something. Perhaps it was something that was stolen from him, and he wants it back, and he's out for revenge. And somehow we get the idea that because some government or some priest or some religion or some teachers or some adults are in a position of authority, it's them They stole it. Yeah. Okay. And so the poor child, in ignorance, not knowing what he's doing, starts down the path of the rebel. And he rebels and he rebels and he rebels because that's all he knows how to do. But it does not bring happiness, brings him a lot of suffering. Yeah, okay. And so this is one of the ways of getting started, but what it is, it's always based upon ignorance. Because when we're— should everybody recognize it right now? You're a whole lot smarter than you were when you were in the first grade. Have you ever had the idea, wow, if I knew what I knew now and went back to the first grade, hot dog, what a good student I would be? Yeah, well, guess what? The first graders are going to gang up on you. You better watch out. You don't belong there. But anyway, this whole idea then about trying to go back and get a do-over and do it again and compete on an unlevel playing field. This is all part of that unwholesomeness of trying to regain the control that we thought that we had lost. By the time we'd gotten into the first grade, we were already missing something, and we thought everybody else had it except for me. And so kids grow up wanting to be somebody else at a different age than they are, looking differently. The boys want to be a girl and they don't want to tell anybody, and the girls want to be a boy and they don't want to tell anybody. And it doesn't matter what it is, I'm not good enough. And this is what is the underlying foundation of the fact that we all grow up into adulthood feeling like losers. Guess what? You're not. You really are the emperor of your own pile of dirt. Yeah, the question is, are you going to be buried under it? Are you going to sit on top of the world? Yeah, well, most emperors I know are half buried or deeply buried under their own pile of dirt. And what is that pile of dirt? Their past. Yeah, they're composted crap. That's what it is. Okay, and so this is what we draw on for nourishment. Rather than getting out of that and living on top of it, living above it. In fact, this is a really excellent analogy for the Pali word lokottara, which is translated into the word supramundane. Ajahn Po really loves that word, supramundane, and it literally is getting out of it. So, this is being in the world, And this is being above the world.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Getting on top of it, saying, 'Aha, I see what that is.'

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And then we can remove ourselves from it. We can let that stuff go. We can see that, yes, at one time I got gratification out of it, but now I see the danger in it. And from that danger, I can plot my escape. Yeah. So in a way, you could think of this whole teaching then as also a cost-benefit analysis. What's the benefit and what's the cost? Before, we only saw the benefit and we didn't recognize what the cost was. That's the ignorance. I want that thing and I'll do anything to get it, except that anything may be way too expensive.

**Speaker A:** I have a question, Bhante. Well, also my meditation practice changed during our last teaching. And what I found out is that I got a very pleasant feeling in the body, like my body started to feel very light and I had a very great feeling.

**Speaker B:** Oxygen will do that for you.

**Speaker A:** What would be the next step? Is it just enjoy? Just enjoy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, pump yourself up and get some air in there and get things going and enjoy. But now the enjoyment is to enjoy the experience of it. And what I mean by that is now is the time when real noting begins. Okay. Okay. Except that now the only thing there is to note are wholesome things,

**Speaker A:** which is the feeling. Or what is it exactly then? Is it the feeling?

**Speaker B:** A whole bunch of stuff. The Buddha's got quite a long list. In fact, takes about 3 lines of text to get all the things in there. Okay, okay. But We know where he got the list. We can look right there and say, aha, Buddha, I know what you're doing here. And that is, is that think about the things that are wholesome and start to investigate things that are wholesome and notice that as you're investigating this wholesome thing, that is, that it will pass away and you'll note another wholesome thing. And as you note this new wholesome thing, this old one will die out. And then when you begin to note this next wholesome thing, then the noting of this wholesome thing dies out. It's always the arising and the passing away, that things arise only to flitter away. So even the wholesome things will arise and pass away. If we are doing the noting of the arising and passing away and the stuff that is arising and passing away is unwholesome, then we think, "Good riddance, and I am glad that I am finished with that," only to be disappointed when it arises again. But if we are only doing that with the wholesome, that also means that we are also paying attention to what is real. Because almost always the unwholesome is not real. It's based in the past, it's based in desire, it's based in the future, it's based in something that's not completely real. But if we're finished with the unreal, the unwholesome, and we're dealing only with the real and the wholesome, then that means that we're more likely going to be dealing with things that are really true and really in extent right now. Okay, so let's go through that, because if we are in the state of the mind being very wholesome and we have the body energized, what that means is, is that we feel pretty good. We've actually talked ourselves into feeling really good. We do have the Sukkha and we do have the Piti, and the Piti can be expressed as either the tingling of the body or the feeling in the sense of, "I can do this," the winner, that this is nice, comes, you know, this is good stuff, got it, that's right, okay. So, when we are in that state, then we begin to notice these things. We're still going to do a full-on investigation, but now what we're investigating is in fact this very good feeling of Sukkha. We are going to also investigate that attitude of "I can do this." We also investigate the fact that we can apply the mind to the wholesome and keep it sustained there. In essence now, what I am actually saying is that the first group of items on the Buddha's list of things to observe while you are in the first Jhana are the factors of first Jhana. Funny like that, isn't it? That's the first thing he puts up there. Why? Because that's what's happening right now, is that you do have Sukkha, you do have Piti, you do feel really good, you do feel like you're on top of your own pile of dirt. So, while we're feeling that way, we investigate that the properties, the qualities of that. We also investigate the qualities of the skills that we got into that state with, in the sense of, this is right Sati, how is my Sati? In fact, that's one of the things that we always put on the list of every list, is always put Sati in there. And here it shows up in this list, simply because it's part of the Eightfold Noble Path. One of the things to investigate is, how's my Sati? Am I waking up? Am I getting faster? Can I note things quick? Okay, how's my Sati? How's my investigation? How's my effort? How's my attitude? So we're going right back into the qualities of the first Jhana. There's also the qualities of the skills that were developed with the Eightfold Noble Path. Interesting. Okay. And then the next group of things are going to be the secondary things that are associated with that, and one of them would be, well, how's my relaxation? How's my tranquility? How's my effort or energy? How is my Piti? How is my Sukkha? How is my tranquility or relaxation? Okay, these are the kind of qualities that we look for, but in this regard, I have just now gone down into the list of the Sambhojana, the Seven Factors of Enlightenment. Okay, now you're getting it. Okay, and so we have enthusiasm, we have tranquility or relaxation. We have integration in the sense of, is my mind finally settling down into a unit, into a wholeness? OK, so because when we have the Jhana factors together, the first Jhana, the mind becomes unified and whole and it's not split between wholesome and unwholesome anymore, it's fully wholesome.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I get it. So to get you right, it's On the one hand, it is enjoying first jhana, jhana factors, and on the other hand, it's investigating.

**Speaker B:** Investigating that state that we're in, because if we investigate it fully, we're going to figure out how to make it better and better. It's like a race car engine mechanic who is sitting there listening and tuning and tweaking and tuning and figuring out what's going on, and that engine more powerful and Yes, this is how we do it, and by doing that, this is the right way to go right into then some other deeper things, and that would be the actual components of the mind itself, in the sense of investigating not just the Piti and the Sukkha and the tranquility, but we go a little deeper into the nature of those feelings, down to how feelings contact us and how perception guides that contact. OK, now at this level, we're talking about the levels of Paticcasamuppada, the actual processes of how the mind works. But we don't go to the second half of Paticcasamuppada, which we'll talk about later. The whole show. But we're not going to go then from Vedana into Tanha, Upadana, Bhavana, Jati, and Dukkha. Why? Well, Tanha and Upadana are grasping, clinging, rebirth, reborn into the woeful states of Dukkha. Why? Because we've got only wholesome thoughts going here, Bob. We're not going off into that direction, we're staying in the wholesome. So those are things that part of the Paticcasamuppada we're going to interrupt, because now we do have wisdom at that point of contact. We actually see how things begin to contact us, and with that, that's the door into understanding perception and how perception and consciousness work together. And all of this can be figured out by simply watching how the mind is working. How do those thoughts arise? What is going on in there? Okay, but we can't do it when the mind is crowded with hindrances. We'll grab some thought and off we go with it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so this is also part of investigation during first Jhana because this is the point where you can see clearly.

**Speaker B:** Where you can see clearly, right? So now that we can see clearly, let's go look Let's go take a peek. Now we've gotten ready to look. So that's the difference, is that in most of the techniques they say, go look for it, tally-ho, the fox, go get it. All right, Buddha says, wait a minute, why don't we get a saddle on the horse and get the dogs collected together and get in some nice clothing, and let's make a sport out of this. And then we're ready to go. Now we'll go get the fox. Okay, we got to get ourselves all dressed up for this show, which means we got to clean out all the junk and all the unwholesome and all the dangers and fears and anxieties and get the mind in really good shape, tip-top shape. Then we can go off on that fox hunt.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and is First Jhana the best place to do it?

**Speaker B:** That's what the Buddha says, and that's what it seems to be. Okay, now I will add this caveat, and that is that as you get very, very skilled in this first Jhana, there will be other doors open. But another way of talking about it is, in a physical reality, how can you get one note out of a violin?

**Speaker A:** Of a what?

**Speaker B:** Out of a violin, a fiddle. Oh, I don't know. You know, okay. Yeah, yeah. How do you get one note out of a violin? Okay, the way that you get a note out of the violin is, number one, you've got to have a violin.

**Speaker A:** That is definitely right there.

**Speaker B:** And number two, you have to have one string on that violin. So let's think of First Jhana like that. Is the first thing we've got to do with the— with First Jhana is get a violin. We've got to get a fiddle. If we're going to fiddle with something, we've got to have a fiddle. Okay, that's most of the work. That means that we've got to get all the non-fiddle out of it so that there's only fiddle left. Fit as a fiddle, so they speak. Okay, and so that means that once we get the instrument built so that we can play one note, adding the extra 3 strings is quite easy. 90% of the time and effort that it takes is going to be just to get into and begin to manage first Jhana. Once that happens, then we can do something new. But the first thing is, is that we've got to get into the first Jhana. And basically the Buddha talks about it in the sense of that once we have the thoughts all in a row, one wholesome thought after another wholesome thought after another wholesome thought. That's like the cowherd getting his cows into a pasture where they're doing wholesome things so that he does not have to stand there with a stick to guard them. He can go sit down under a tree. And the Buddha then likens that to where once we get the thoughts wholesome, one thought, a wholesome thought after another wholesome thought that's well investigated for a long time, that means that now we can begin to put some gaps in those thoughts, but that all the observation that we're going to be able to do in this can be done in the first Jhana. That in fact what happens is that when we begin to put the gaps in the thoughts is when we can begin to see things a little more clearly, but we can see them while we're giving running dialogue also. So as we progress through the jhanas, what that only means is, is that some of the items of the wholesome that are on the list of First Jhana get removed. That's all. There is never a time when we go and sprinkle fear, disgust, misery, or any of those— that kind of desire for stuff that you find on Mahasi's path up at step 5, 6, 7, and 8. We're way down there at step 1 now. We're still at, uh, at the purifying the mind. So as we get the mind completely purified, then we can begin to put some gaps in it, and the gaps between the thoughts would then be second Jhana. But that's when we begin to not think about how good we feel, we just feel good.

**Speaker A:** So the thinking of the feeling is that Vitakka-Vicara? Second Jhana is without that, is that right?

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I see.

**Speaker B:** So thinking our way into feeling, and then we begin to put some space in those thoughts so that we begin to experience just the feeling itself, and pretty soon we're left with nothing but the feelings themselves, with no thoughts much.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and if I got you right, this is the right point to just note?

**Speaker B:** And always just noting of what's there and what's not there. But in second jhana, we do live off the applied and sustained thinking. But there is still the Piti and the Sukkha of the second jhana, and that in the second jhana, after the mind is completely still and we are, let us say, so exhilarated and so euphoric and so happy, we realize that that euphoria is a little bit of work. And so going into the third jhana is just letting that euphoria melt into a really easy, happy, comfortable state. And sometimes that happens really quickly for people. Like I said, that second and third stream can come in really easily once we get the foundation of the first jhana. But people in fact will float in and out of first and second and third. It actually begins to— when you start recognizing them, that's how you can classify them. Of all, this is definitely third Jhana. Oh, this is definitely Second Jhana. Okay, and so that's how you begin to notice it, but it's all in the sense of there's still only a few things to note, like enthusiasm, tranquility, relaxation. These are the things that are left, and also the actual functioning of the mind, consciousness, and perception is still there. Only now you've gotten so much of the other clutter cleared out of the way that you can actually more easily see the consciousness in the higher jhanas. Okay. Because you're still thinking and still feeling in the lower jhanas, it's a little bit more difficult to see the perception. You could see it. You could say it this way, that it's not just detectable, it's clearly visible in the first jhana. But in the fourth jhana, it'll come beat you up, it'll slap your face. It's like there's nothing left, but this is it, okay? Watching how this mind works is basically the only thing that's left in the higher jhanas, because we have in fact by then put away the pleasures and the joys and the feelings so that we can get right down to what is consciousness, what is perception. Okay, but that means that now the mind is very sharp, not dull at all. This is not deep meditation, it's going not deep, it's going bright. It's getting sharper and more focused and more clear. So the— and also more subtle, because it's almost like this. Here's a good analogy. A high-speed film camera. In the very, very early days of photography, they had to put those box cameras on tripods. Had to. Why? Because the silver oxide coating had to have a lot of light to expose it, so people had to sit for a long period of time right out in the daylight. And then they would take— they'd take their lunch cover off, hold it 1, 2, 3, and put it back on and leave the lens open for 3 seconds. That means the camera has to be really stable. So that means that when our, when our, um, when our mind is very slow, we're going to miss a lot of things. But now modern cameras, we have really high-speed film. We can do things really quickly with film, so that now what used to take 3 seconds exposure They could do that in, uh, you know, 400 film, 1600, you know. Okay, all right. So this is the quality of Sati. Start investigating: how quick am I? How's my response time? How long does that thought recur before I caught you? I can see what's going on. And so this is a— this is part of the process that these are the skills that we develop in the first jhana, that if we go from the first jhana to the fourth jhana, for most people, once they get there, they don't know what to do. They don't have the skills developed. But this is in fact what happens with all the jhana dudes. It happened to students of the Buddha, and it happened to the Buddha too. The Buddha recognized, oh no, it's the first jhana is the path to enlightenment. That's where all the work is done. Okay, getting into and developing the first Jhana, that's the one that requires all the skills. Once you fully develop the first Jhana and do all the work that you need to do in the first Jhana, the other Jhanas will be quite natural. They fall into place. Okay, but if you struggle and gain them very quickly, you won't know what to do with them when you got them.

**Speaker A:** I see.

**Speaker B:** All right, but when we develop correctly, that means that we know exactly what to do because we've been doing all of that stuff in first jhana. Now the list is just getting shorter and shorter, which means now we spend more and more time, our mind moments, on perception itself until we really understand it and the connections therein. And this is what those higher jhanas are all about, is what you can do when your mind is really sharp. Really focused.

**Speaker A:** Okay,

**Speaker B:** so not concentrated, by the way, just sharp, fast, able to see what's happening at the mind at a very subtle, very quick level.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay, I see.

**Speaker B:** Like the time that it takes from the time of looking at a tree to the time of saying or even thinking that that I see a tree. That's the time frame that we're looking at, and all of that took, what, 3 or 4 tenths of a second at most.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** That's why we have to get really fast, is to be able to see that stuff. But in the beginning, because the mind is wholesome, we can see the things more lingering, but we can still see them arising and passing away and arising and passing away, and begin to see everything in that arising and passing away motion. So now you can begin to see those same waves in consciousness itself, arising and passing away, and perception arising and passing away. Only it takes me 10,000 times as long to say that as it does for it to actually occur.

**Speaker A:** Is this also a way to understand impermanence?

**Speaker B:** This is impermanence. You're seeing it directly now. Okay, that's what this is all about, is to actually see. But it's not the event that's impermanent, it's the mind. Ah, yeah, okay. It's the mind, it's the observer that's coming and going and coming and going every time we take a different object. And we're going to be taking a whole bunch of objects, but all of them in this case is wholesome. As opposed to the Mahayana method, which is anything that comes up. No, and we've got a short list here, about 15 or 20 items on that list, but we've already gone over the gist of it. Okay, so I really feel like— yeah, okay. So, so even though we are, um, progressing in the Jhanas, all that means is, is that there is less to look at and more time to look at it. But we can see perception, we can see consciousness, we can see Vedana, we can see how that Vedana and the perception contacts us to give us these feelings right there in First Jhana. We can see how the mind works. And this is not just because I say so, this is the Buddha's list. And so this is what we mean by the noting, Dan, is we have to get ourselves into a really, really nice state that we call the first Jhana. And now we're going to note what's there, and everything that we note is wholesome.

**Speaker A:** So this is the next thing to do. I was— the question was what I do with that feeling.

**Speaker B:** And now you know. Yeah, definitely.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, definitely.

**Speaker B:** Okay, Peter, we'll finish this call off now and you go play with this. Yeah, don't think of this as work to do. This is a new toy to play with, your own mind.

**Speaker A:** I'll give you feedback in some time.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, we'll see you.

**Speaker A:** I'm happy to see you again, Bhante. Thank you very much.

**Speaker B:** Bye-bye. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) in dialogue with a student, Peter (Speaker A), centers on a crucial shift in meditation practice: moving from passive awareness to **active cultivation of wholesome states** through Right Effort.

Here is a summary of the key points:

### Core Teaching: Right Effort is Essential
*   **The Problem with "Choiceless Awareness":** The talk begins by identifying a common pitfall in modern meditation: merely noting or being aware of the present moment (often called "choiceless awareness") without actively addressing unwholesome states. This is likened to living in a mental mess without cleaning it up, which can lead to stress and even the "dangerous" side effects sometimes reported in Western Buddhism.
*   **The Solution - Mental Hygiene:** Just as we bathe to maintain physical hygiene, we must actively "clean" the mind. The foundational practice of Buddhism is **taking a "mental bath"**—using Right Effort to recognize and remove unwholesome thoughts (like anger, criticism, desire) and replace them with wholesome ones (like relaxation, metta/loving-kindness, contentment).
*   **You Create Your Reality:** A central theme is that our thoughts are the forerunner of our experience. Unwholesome thoughts create stress and conflict ("You are the creator of your own reality... until then, it's the boss of you"). By taking control of our thoughts, we take control of our emotional life and how we interact with the world (illustrated with examples like dealing with a police officer or a barking dog).

### The Practical Method: From Stress to Jhana
1.  **Recognize and Replace:** When a stressful or unwholesome thought arises, recognize it and consciously apply an antidote—a wholesome thought like "relax," "it's okay," or "metta."
2.  **Build a "Positive Feedback Loop":** This active effort creates success. Each time you replace an unwholesome thought with a wholesome one, you strengthen your confidence ("hot dog, I can do this!"). This builds the factors of the Eightfold Path (Right View, Right Mindfulness, Right Effort) in a reinforcing cycle.
3.  **Cultivate First Jhana:** As you consistently maintain wholesome thoughts, the mind becomes unified, joyful, and energized (Piti) and experiences happiness/pleasure (Sukkha). This is the development of **First Jhana**.
4.  **Investigate from a Place of Strength:** First Jhana is **not an end goal but a platform for clear investigation**. With a calm, happy, and wholesome mind, you can clearly observe:
    *   The Jhana factors themselves (joy, happiness, unification of mind).
    *   The factors of enlightenment (energy, tranquility, etc.).
    *   The true nature of mind, perception, and feeling (*vedana*) without being pulled into craving (*tanha*).
    *   **Impermanence (*anicca*)** in its pure form, seeing the rapid arising and passing of wholesome mental states.

### Deeper Jhanas as Natural Refinements
*   The higher jhanas (second, third, fourth) are presented not as drastically different states but as natural refinements of the first.
*   As the mind becomes more skilled and serene, coarser factors (like applied thought) fade away, leaving a subtler, brighter, and more focused awareness. This allows for an even clearer investigation of consciousness and perception.
*   **The crucial work is done in First Jhana.** Mastering it—learning to create, sustain, and investigate a wholesome mind—provides all the necessary skills. The higher jhanas then unfold naturally as the "list" of things to investigate becomes shorter and more profound.

### Key Takeaways for Practice:
*   Shift from passive noting to **active cultivation**.
*   Treat unwholesome thoughts as **dangerous** and immediately replace them.
*   View this practice as **taking control and creating a happy, safe inner reality**.
*   Use the joyful, concentrated state of First Jhana as the **optimal ground for insight**.
*   Understand the path as **"good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end"**—the relief and benefits are immediate, not distant.

In essence, the talk is a practical guide to using the Buddha's core teaching on Right Effort to transform daily stress into a joyful, insightful meditation practice that begins paying dividends from the very first moment of correct application.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Bhante, Speaker B) uses several vivid **metaphors and stories** to explain Buddhist concepts, particularly focusing on meditation, right effort, and the development of wholesome states of mind.

Here is a breakdown of the key metaphors and stories used:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Mental Hygiene / Taking a Bath:** This is the central metaphor. The speaker compares cleansing the mind of unwholesome thoughts to taking a physical bath. Just as physical hygiene prevents disease, "mental hygiene" (replacing unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones) prevents mental suffering.
    *   *Quote:* "what mental hygiene is all about— taking a bath, taking a mental bath."

2.  **Spoiling the Nest:** The speaker compares dwelling in unwholesome thoughts to an animal that spoils its own nest when caged in too tightly.
    *   *Quote:* "an animal that's caged in too tight a place... will spoil its own nest. And then that's the only thing that they know how to do. And so this is what humans do on at least a mental level."

3.  **Writing in Stone, Sand, and Water/Air:** This metaphor contrasts the Brahmanical and Buddhist views on karma. The Brahmanical view sees action as carving in stone (permanent), speech as writing in sand (less permanent), and thought as writing in water or air (insignificant). The Buddha reverses this, saying the mind (thought) is the forerunner of everything.
    *   *Quote:* "action is like carving into stone... wrong speech then would be like writing in the sand... wrong thought is like writing in the air or writing on the water."

4.  **The Spark of Anger:** Unwholesome thoughts are compared to a spark that can ignite a dangerous situation, like showing anger to a police officer during a traffic stop.
    *   *Quote:* "if we have a spark of a bad thought about someone and set something in motion, we can actually— just a spark can wind up getting someone killed."

5.  **The Wheel / Positive Feedback Loop / Avalanche:** The speaker uses multiple related metaphors to describe how right view, right effort, and right mindfulness reinforce each other. Once you start, it builds momentum like a wheel turning, a snowball rolling downhill, or an avalanche.
    *   *Quote:* "it's a positive feedback loop... just like an avalanche... rolling a snowball down the hill."

6.  **The Pile of Dirt / Compost:** One's past unwholesome karma and thoughts are compared to a "pile of dirt" or "composted crap." The goal is not to be buried under it but to sit on top of it, understanding it from a position of clarity ("supramundane").
    *   *Quote:* "most emperors I know are half buried or deeply buried under their own pile of dirt. And what is that pile of dirt? Their past."

7.  **The Violin (Fiddle):** Developing the first jhana (a state of concentrated, wholesome awareness) is compared to building a violin. Most of the work is crafting the instrument itself (purifying the mind). Once you have it, adding the other strings (attaining higher jhanas) is relatively easy.
    *   *Quote:* "think of First Jhana like that... get a fiddle... once we get the instrument built so that we can play one note, adding the extra 3 strings is quite easy."

8.  **The Fox Hunt:** Proper investigation (*dhamma vicaya*) is compared to a formal fox hunt. You don't just run off chaotically; you first prepare—saddle the horse, gather the dogs, put on the right clothes (i.e., purify the mind into a wholesome state)—and *then* you go out with clarity and skill.
    *   *Quote:* "Buddha says, wait a minute, why don't we get a saddle on the horse and get the dogs collected together... and then we're ready to go. Now we'll go get the fox."

9.  **The Cowherd:** Once wholesome thoughts become habitual, the mind no longer needs constant correction, like a cowherd who can sit under a tree once his cows are calmly grazing in a safe pasture.
    *   *Quote:* "he does not have to stand there with a stick to guard them. He can go sit down under a tree."

10. **Camera Film Speed:** The increasing sharpness and speed of awareness (*sati*) in deeper meditation is compared to advancing from old, slow film (requiring long, stable exposures) to modern high-speed film (capturing subtle, rapid events).
    *   *Quote:* "when our mind is very slow, we're going to miss a lot of things. But now modern cameras, we have really high-speed film."

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Danger of Unwholesome Thoughts (Reddit Anecdote):** The speaker references a Reddit question: "What is something that is really dangerous but that people do not perceive it as danger?" His answer is "unwholesome thoughts," illustrating how people underestimate the power of their own thinking.

2.  **Penn (of Penn & Teller) on Thoughts:** The speaker cites the magician Penn's belief that only actions and speech matter, not thoughts, to illustrate a common modern view that directly contradicts the Buddha's teaching on the primacy of the mind.

3.  **Interaction with a Police Officer:** This is used both as a metaphor (the "spark") and as a practical story. It explains how our internal attitude (fear/anger vs. calm/friendliness) directly shapes external reality and the behavior of others.
    *   *Quote:* "if you're very friendly with them, they'll be friendly back. If you act afraid of them, they're going to bark at you."

4.  **Dogs Barking at Fear:** A simple anecdote about how dogs sense and react to a person's fear, used to parallel the interaction with the police officer and the idea that we project our internal state onto the world.
    *   *Quote:* "dogs only bark at people who are afraid of them."

5.  **The Child's Feeling of Lack:** A story about how children (and then adults) grow up feeling like "losers," believing they are missing something others have. This story explains the origin of the "comparative mind" and the underlying sense of insufficiency that drives suffering.

**Overall Purpose:** These metaphors and stories serve to make abstract Buddhist principles (Right Effort, the nature of thought, *jhana*, *anicca*) concrete, relatable, and memorable. They emphasize the **active, cleansing, and skill-building** aspect of meditation, as opposed to a passive "noting" of experience.
