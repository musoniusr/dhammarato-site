### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, that's all right.

**Speaker B:** Okay, Daniel, I do have the question though, where did you get your ideas about.

**Speaker A:** Rebirth? My ideas about rebirth, yeah, is what initially got me interested in Buddhism. Because, yeah, I saw the description of the Four Path Model and that if you become an Arahant that you end the cycle of birth and rebirth. And that seemed to me like a very comforting idea because, yeah, I had—.

**Speaker C:** Why don't you do that right now? That's the whole point of it. You see, you missed the point. Ending the birth of rebirth. If you become an Arahant, that means right now you are not going to get reborn into any of your trash. Yeah, but what does that then have to do with reincarnation kind of rebirth that you're believing in?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. So as I understand it from the interviews that I've watched from you, is that there's two types of rebirth. There's one on the macro level that people think about as in reincarnation, and also on the mental level. And I believe, and that's what I wanted to discuss with you, is that you believe or experience that rebirth is only on the mental level in the form of dependent origination, and not on the macro level in terms of reincarnation.

**Speaker C:** I've never heard that macro-level kind of verbiage before, but one of the things you can count on is that people want to believe in reincarnation and that kind of rebirth. And they want to do it because they've got a reason for it, and that reason is that they're afraid to die. And so there's a kind of promise that you don't have to actually die.

**Speaker B:** That you can continue on clinging to.

**Speaker C:** Life without actually experiencing it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, for me it's the other way around. I'm actually not afraid to die, but I'm afraid of rebirth because I don't.

**Speaker C:** Want to experience it.

**Speaker B:** Don't do it then.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Stop doing it right now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** That's actually the injunction that's given in Sutta 20. A lot of the rebirthers, and I call them that as a joke, A lot of rebirthers will quote that sutta as proof that the Buddha taught rebirth.

**Speaker B:** But the last line of it is, therefore do not be reborn.

**Speaker C:** As if.

**Speaker B:** You'Ve got a choice about it.

**Speaker C:** But if you're dead, how do you.

**Speaker B:** Have a choice about being reborn again? You've lost your choice after you're dead, so the rebirth has to be done as a choice while you're still alive.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so you're saying that I have a choice to rebirth or not?

**Speaker C:** Yes, you make that choice on a regular basis and you choose to be reborn into Dukkha reborn into suffering, reborn into the Four Woeful States of being angry, agitated, worried, upset; or you're being reborn as a Preta, wanting things that you don't have; or you're reborn as a dumb animal, which is basically the Buddha's talking about trapped animals, rather than birds, bees, and insects; No, the draft.

**Speaker B:** Animals, the horses, the cows, sometimes elephants are put to work. They don't like it, but they do the work anyway.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, okay. That's what we call business in English language. Yeah, doing what you were told to do without getting the reward of doing it. Yeah, that's being reborn in a woeful state of doing things that you've got to do and you don't want to do them, but you got to do it anyway.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** And then the fourth one, the Asuras, is being reborn as a warrior that's afraid to go to battle. So that's the fear.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** And you're born in all four of those states on a regular basis. And you do it by choice. Ignorant choice.

**Speaker A:** When you talk about these rebirths, For me, it's very hard to understand because from which level you are talking. Are you talking in the sense of a mental rebirth only in this life? Or are you talking?

**Speaker C:** What other would you think of? Because you don't know what the distant future is, and in fact, you've already probably understood that the Buddha was big on being in the present moment, right here, right now. He even had the name Tathagata, which has the word tatata in it, and the word tatata means this is it, thusness, here now, this present moment, all of that kind of stuff is what the Buddha was really big on. He wasn't big on old memories, 5 years old, 10 years old. So what makes you think he's going to be interested in teaching about 500-year-old memories, which you don't have?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but yeah, I also read the suttas, especially today I was reading a commentary by Tanha Saro Bhikkhuni.

**Speaker C:** Okay, don't read commentaries, read suttas.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, so the actual suttas he shows in the commentary as well, so I can read them for myself. And in the suttas, yeah, Buddha also speaks of that after the breaking up of the body, so after death, that there is also rebirth. And it seems to me he's talking—.

**Speaker C:** Where did you find that? I'd like to hear the reference.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I can send it to you later. I'm not sure if I can get it really quickly now, but it's from the website Access to Insights.

**Speaker C:** It may be very much the possibility of a bad translation, because that's the biggest problem with Western Buddhism, is that the Westerners who have done the translations wanted to know what the Suttas meant. That's why they translated them. Yeah, they didn't know what the Sutta meant when they did translate it. So yeah, example of that is imagine that the CIA during World War II were able to steal secret documents, let us say on nuclear, from the Germans. Yeah, is the CIA going to take those documents, high quality physics, all of that kind of stuff. Are they going to take that to a high school German class to translate? No, no, no, no. They're going to take it to a nuclear physicist who knows both German and English.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Okay, we don't have any translations of the suttas that have all three components.

**Speaker A:** No.

**Speaker C:** Okay, everybody who does the translation, at best they know one of the three, and that is their own native language. But they don't know Pali as if they were fluent in the language. Only a few monks in Thailand are fluent in Pali, but Westerners, not a chance. Yeah. And then the number 3, which is the big one, is that all of those people who did all of those translations didn't know what they were translating, and so they translated it with their confirmation bias. Built in.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, makes sense.

**Speaker C:** Okay, and so that's the problem with the suttas, and most of the words that are really, really important words are often wrongly translated. Yeah, Dukkha, for instance, is translated as suffering, and Dukkha doesn't mean suffering at all. What it means is dissatisfaction, and you're.

**Speaker B:** Dissatisfied on a regular basis.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker C:** Okay, and when you're dissatisfied, that means you're born into one of those woeful states of dissatisfaction. Yeah, one of the four modes of clinging, right? And that happens on a regular basis. What makes you think that you could do something now that's going to stop something 500 years from now that you.

**Speaker B:** Can'T stop right now?

**Speaker A:** Well, I believe, I do believe that I can stop it in this life.

**Speaker C:** And well, then let's do that. It's not worry about a distant future you've got no control over.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Believe that stuff, say that you don't have any control over it then, that because it's all Kamma-based. The Kamma of this life is going to set up the next life, and that's what they commonly believe. So they go do Pujas and they go do saibat, making merit, in order to give them a better chance next time, and they miss this time altogether. Yeah, then they're dead with no hope because of no knowledge of what happens after one dies. All you've heard is stories.

**Speaker A:** So then my question would be like, if there is no rebirth, then yeah, of course it would be better to experience this life in an enlightened state.

**Speaker C:** Right. Well, you said in your thing that you— why not just make merry until you die? And you can't do that yet because you're still dissatisfied. And making merry means that you're merry and satisfied all the time. What are you going to do to get into that state?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, okay, let's say I do agree that of course it's better to experience this life in a good state. But for me, the main motivation has always been that, I guess, the promise, and I wanted to see that for myself, that I would not have to experience this Samsara after this life again.

**Speaker C:** Okay, and what's going to happen then? You're going to be continuously unsatisfied, continuously so until you die. And then you have no possibility of doing anything after that, because you're dead.

**Speaker A:** Yes, and on the one hand— And.

**Speaker C:** All that's going to be there is a Kamma machine that's going to dig you up out of the grave 300 years from now, just to kick your ass again.

**Speaker A:** But if you're saying that, then you're kind of saying that there's actual rebirth if the karma machine digs you up?

**Speaker C:** No, I'm saying two things, okay? Number one, I don't know, and you don't either.

**Speaker B:** And number two, it's irrelevant.

**Speaker C:** And it.

**Speaker B:** Doesn'T matter because it's got no effect upon you today unless believe in it. And if you believe in it, then.

**Speaker C:** It will stop your belief about the future, or prevent you from being able.

**Speaker B:** To benefit right here, right now.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, phone is quite noisy. Yeah, if you talk, it will stop the noise.

**Speaker A:** Oh, this must be better.

**Speaker C:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay, so Yeah, I wonder then, what was the motivation for you to pursue this path? Like, if you would know that maybe you will be practicing for 40 years and not reach enlightenment?

**Speaker C:** Here's the point. The answer that we can take right quickly, and that is, is that so far you have not seen Dukkha. You have not seeing your disappointment, and because of it, you're trying to avoid future disappointment instead of avoiding the disappointments that you have right here, right now.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker C:** You can't see the disappointments that you're having right here, right now. You're not looking closely enough to see what's going on. And so here you are, off about way off into the future that you have no clue about. No one knows the future.

**Speaker A:** That's true.

**Speaker C:** The only thing that we know is, is that everything is temporary. Nothing lasts, even awakening. Well, when you're dead, how awake are you?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I heard one of your interviews, and in there you said that you compared it to weeding a garden, that at first, or shaving a beard, at first you have to shave a lot, and then after that you still need to keep shaving because it's impermanent. So I'm wondering then, since enlightenment is.

**Speaker C:** Often present— Anagami was impermanent. Yes, so was the beard. Dead people don't grow beards. Yeah, not for long.

**Speaker A:** Not for long, no. But yeah, like the insights, enlightenment is often presented as a permanent insight.

**Speaker C:** By whom?

**Speaker A:** Chuladasa, for one.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, well, one of the things that we can do with Tuladasa right now is let him be impermanent. Yeah, okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and among Tuladasa, well, that's the general idea that I got. And of course, yeah, for me, like, reading the suttas, even the language is very complicated, and I'm not sure about the translations.

**Speaker C:** So.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the thing that got me very interested is to call you. Can you tell me more about what Buddha Dasa taught about rebirth?

**Speaker C:** He taught two things about it. Number one, you don't know. And number two, it's irrelevant. Okay, let me go back and explain this in another way.

**Speaker B:** There are always six ways to answer.

**Speaker C:** A yes or no question.

**Speaker B:** And right now you're in the throes of, yes, it's done. Yes, there is reincarnation. We'll use the word reincarnation just to make sure that we're not confusing what the word rebirth means. And you're saying yes, there is reincarnation, and you think I'm saying no, there is not.

**Speaker C:** Those are two possibilities.

**Speaker B:** Let's go with the third possibility, and that is both. After death, there is both reincarnation and not reincarnation. The next possibility is neither one. There is no reincarnation and there there is no non-reincarnation. The fifth answer is that I don't know. That's the obvious answer. And then the sixth one is I don't know because it doesn't matter.

**Speaker C:** What evidence do we have? If there's absolutely no evidence of something.

**Speaker B:** Existing or not, then it doesn't matter.

**Speaker C:** Whether it exists or not.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker C:** And you still don't know. That's the first thing that you have to accept, is that you don't know. And right now you still have the confirmation bias. You want it to be true. Come back to a neutral position and realize that you don't know and it really doesn't matter.

**Speaker A:** Well, it doesn't matter. I find that part kind of hard to accept because then I become fearful.

**Speaker C:** Here's the point then, that you're clinging probably to the concept of Good action gives good results, and bad action gives bad results. This is ordinary view, ordinary right view, as opposed to ordinary wrong view, which is that, "No, it doesn't. I can get away with it.".

**Speaker B:** Now, every human, mostly, a few rare exceptions within the Dhamma, But most people, let's call them Buddhajana, ordinary people, they don't know the difference.

**Speaker C:** They don't know.

**Speaker B:** And so they will cling to the.

**Speaker C:** One that they like.

**Speaker B:** And whichever one that you like, that's.

**Speaker C:** The belief system that we build up.

**Speaker B:** The Buddha didn't teach about belief systems. He taught only one thing, and that is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Now, the interesting thing is that he said that in Sutta number 22, the simile of the snake in the Majjhima Nikaya, where he was accused of teaching that upon the breakup of the body, the existing being is annihilated. He doesn't teach that. He doesn't teach annihilationism. But he was never accused of teaching eternalism.

**Speaker C:** Why? Because all of the ones who were accusing him of teaching annihilationism were already eternalists themselves, mostly.

**Speaker A:** And eternalism, can you help me? What is this precisely again?

**Speaker C:** Well, let us use eternalism versus semi-eternalism. Okay, eternalism means it's going to happen again and again and again and again and again and again into infinity. No such thing as infinity. In fact, everything comes to an end, maybe trillions of years from now, but that probably is just the end of.

**Speaker B:** A part of a cycle, and then.

**Speaker C:** Things start another trillions and years and come back to the beginning again. And so we don't know any of that stuff. And guess what? It's irrelevant.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so given that everything is temporary, there is no real such thing as true eternalism. And the way that they normally thinking is, and your thinking is, is at all. I will be eternal until something happens, and then my eternalism will stop. Like, finally, after 500 births from now, you'll get—.

**Speaker A:** Sorry, I'm losing the audio here for about 10 seconds.

**Speaker C:** Okay, finally, after— All right, so the The semi-eternalism means that after a long, long time, many hundreds, maybe thousands of rebirths, finally you become enlightened, and then you don't have any more rebirths. That's what semi-eternalism is. That's what normal, ordinary, low-class Buddhists believe, is in semi-eternalism. Buddha did not teach. Semi-eternalism.

**Speaker B:** What he taught was Anicca. Now there's the other one which is nihilism, and nihilism or nihilism means basically that there is no Kamma machine, there is no Kamma as long-term, and therefore if I can get away with it right now, I can get away with it. Okay, I could go and do and herd all I want to and nobody's going to do anything about it. And the example that she used there is the guy who kills 500 cows on this side of the river, Anicca. Then he goes to the other side of the river and kills 500 more cows. Herd 500, by the way, in Pali, just means a very large number, it's uncountable.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** And get away with it. Well, guess what? The 500 cows, after he kills one cow, he's going to have to start dealing with farmers. Yeah, for sure.

**Speaker A:** For sure.

**Speaker C:** The cow in India, I don't think he's going to make it to the other side of the river. I don't think he's going to find 500 cows that you can actually kill.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** All right. So he doesn't get away with it. But that's the idea that, oh, I can get away with it because there's no Kamma machine. Well, the Buddha didn't teach that there is no Kamma. He taught cause and effect in the sense of Dukkha and Dukkha-Nirodha. There are causes. That's what the word Paticcasamuppada means. It means that things happen because they are dependently happening.

**Speaker B:** So eternalism, semi-eternalism, nihilism, and Anicca, Anagami, Anapanasati, Annihilationism is not what the Buddha taught, that upon the break of the body, the.

**Speaker C:** Soul or the spirit is annihilated. This is basically what we would in the West call atheism, which is another.

**Speaker B:** Way of getting away with it.

**Speaker C:** The Buddha didn't teach any of those four things. What he taught was temporary-theism. He taught Anicca, Anatta.

**Speaker B:** And what is Anatta is not no-self; it means no permanent entity, that whatever you are is a moving target.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, okay, you're moving. Whatever you are now, you are not. In fact, right now you're not the same person that wrote the email.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** All right, you have been reborn. You're not the same. That's what the word reborn means, not in the sense of taking a new body. The Buddha did not, and was not ever accused even, of teaching either eternalism or semi-eternalism. Nor was he accused of teaching nihilism.

**Speaker B:** But he was accused of teaching annihilationism. Now, what's the difference between annihilationism? It's that the self exists as long as the body exists. But in fact, you're not the same person as you were when you were 3 years old. Not at all the same. Nothing about you is the same except the habits that you picked up when you were 3 years old and continued to repeat. But even those are temporary.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that's what the real teaching of the Buddha is. That's what we're actually harping on about with personality view. And the real question of personality view Burns are all around to the point of, can you, whatever you are, make changes so that you're not what you used to be, and have new choices about what you're going to be each moment?

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] And that's in the context of relieving of suffering, of making that choice.

**Speaker C:** [Speaker:Larouche] Right, you have a choice about whether you're going to suffer right now, or what? Yeah, and you're suffering only because you picked up the habit of suffering. That every child that's born to a human woman starts off ignorant and having the life position of being dependent, being a victim.

**Speaker B:** If the baby is not nurtured, he will die. And so we require that nurturing.

**Speaker C:** But by the time the kid is.

**Speaker B:** 6, very little nurturing and a whole bunch of rules are coming along: do your homework, pick up your clothes, do what you're told to do, stand in line, go to school. 10,000 things come in, and the little kid resents the loss of the company, the nourishment he wants. And Dhammarato now he is being criticized.

**Speaker C:** So we pick up the habit of being critical of ourselves while maintaining the position of being a victim of the criticism.

**Speaker B:** So we grow up in criticizing ourselves and then being the victim of our own criticism. Eric Burns this the parent-child ego, the.

**Speaker A:** Parents and the child's ego, parent, the.

**Speaker C:** Parent and the child ego states. Yeah, Sigmund Freud called the parent the superego, the rules, the way things are supposed to be, the criticism. And the id he called the child. Now, uh, I'm not really all of that great on neurophysiology but we do know enough to know that the reptilian.

**Speaker B:** Brain, the part of it that's in the back, the anterior cortex, is very much original. Dogs have it, wolves have it, all of the primates have it. We've all got it, but they call it the reptilian brain because so do the snakes and the alligators. Basically, it is Anapanasati.

**Speaker A:** Sorry, I lost the audio here for 5 seconds again.

**Speaker C:** Okay, that we all were born with a major part of our being as alligator, and many people still act like alligators, which means that they operate according to their instincts, and they're operating according to a few rules that they picked up. So whatever they like or don't like is how they live their lives, a life full of confirmation bias, okay?

**Speaker B:** Which then means that they're easy to.

**Speaker C:** Manipulate.

**Speaker B:** Through propaganda, through the news, through advertisements.

**Speaker C:** Those people are easy to manipulate because.

**Speaker B:** They like and not like things, so it's easy to put them to work.

**Speaker A:** Work.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, they tell them to be afraid. If you don't work, you don't eat, right? So everybody goes out and works and does that, uh, dumb animal thing, doing what they're told to do.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Okay, so we have an instinctual system, and that instinctual system is also the child in us, which we would also call the feeling, because we are feeling-driven.

**Speaker B:** We are operating not out of wisdom.

**Speaker C:** But out of raw animal emotion.

**Speaker B:** And on top of that is a whole bunch of complicated rules about how that raw animal emotion should operate. That would be the midcortex, the temporal lobes, that part of the brain, the mammalian brain. But humans have something that those other animals don't have, and that is the frontal cortex. But we can see what's going on, put things together, and see the facts.

**Speaker C:** And many engineers could do that with.

**Speaker B:** The engineering, but they've got so much confirmation bias about religion that they wind end up being dumb animals.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Okay, so the example is the scientist who's a scientist 6 days a week, but on Sunday he's a Christian. Yeah, right. That's the confirmation bias. Why? Because he wants the things that Christianity promise, and he's also afraid of doing the things that Christianity tell him, we're going to punish you and hurt you if you do those things. And so there's those rules in.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so what the rules are that the Buddha talks about in the Pali is Sila Bhanta Paramasa, that we are rule-bound and we criticize ourselves and then we feel bad because we don't match up to the rules that we've made for ourselves. And there's no business them in there anyway, not bringing the frontal cortex into play. If we play— if we bring the frontal cortex in, it can see what's going on right here, right now. And all of those old memories are either stored in the cerebellum, which is behind the reptilian brain, or they're stored in language in the form of the Arahant, a vision, right? But the best part of the human being, the frontal cortex, is always seeing what's going on, or realization, or what you would call insight.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, see things clearly only when we're free from the confirmation bias. But we have confirmation bias.

**Speaker B:** Confirmation bias going to win, and then we don't even have to turn on our own personal giant supercomputer, because it uses a whole lot of power.

**Speaker A:** So that's the reason why we live on autopilot, as you say.

**Speaker C:** Right. We live our lives on autopilot, which is instincts, with a few rules. The autopilot is in an airplane, in a superliner. The autopilot is the thing itself that controls the aircraft with the yaw and all of the wing and all of that kind of stuff and the power. And then the rules would be the heading and the destination and all of that kind of information, right? Which, if you leave an airplane on automatic pilot, it's going to crash. Yeah, sure, it's going to crash into the side of a mountain. When the pilot was there, he could lift it up and get out of the way of the mountain because he's watching what's going on. Okay, so that's the problem with automatic pilot, is that it's set for a particular course over the long term, but Anicca comes in, new things happen, and we wind up crash landing. Into our own personal hell, into our own personal animal world, into our own personal fears, or into our own personal desires. That's where we crash land. Why? Because we're not looking at where we're.

**Speaker B:** Going and what we're doing. We're looking at how we feel.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker C:** Okay, so that's the being reborn— being reborn in an unhappy state. That's the Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so you're saying that it's mental dependent origination then?

**Speaker C:** Pardon?

**Speaker A:** That it's mental dependent origination, so that's purely the mental processes that cause the Dukkha, and that it's all contained?

**Speaker C:** I'm getting away with using the word mental there, though I wouldn't use it that way, because it's much more complicated than the word mental. Then in fact, the word Citta does not mean the frontal cortex, or the.

**Speaker B:** Citta is referring to the anterior cortex.

**Speaker C:** That's what needs to be trained. And how we train that is by dropping all of the rules. Start looking at what's going on now and start training in a new way.

**Speaker A:** Yes, and that makes a lot of sense to me that we can train our brain, our consciousness, in this way you describe. But I always heard, I hear people saying that enlightenment is the ultimate freedom from suffering.

**Speaker C:** People who talk of it like that don't have it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Would you say that anything about the path has been disappointing about you, or are you completely fulfilled Would you say that there is anything, anything, well, I would say like unsatisfactory, but of course for you, well, I don't know your attainments or if you even want to talk about those, but for let's say for an enlightened person, for Buddha, do you think there was anything imperfect about the path for him.

**Speaker C:** The Buddha did not teach perfection, to get your last thing. Number 2, in Thailand for sure, but all over the place this should be the case, is that you don't ask rude questions.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, sorry, I didn't want to.

**Speaker C:** Ask, but Well, I'm not offended, but I do want to tell you that some people will be.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Or you'll just give them an opportunity to lie.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Next thing is, is that it does not matter who you ask that question to or their answer, because you'll believe what you want to believe anyway.

**Speaker A:** True.

**Speaker C:** Without doing a thorough investigation. Yeah, okay. So the question— yeah, so the answer to the question is you don't know and it's irrelevant.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, it's— sorry.

**Speaker C:** And say in this case it's rude.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's certainly not my intention to be rude, but I will be.

**Speaker C:** That's the Western mind. And the Thai people would never ask that of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, but occasionally a rude Westerner would, and his answer would be, "Who or what is it that can be enlightened?" And he was making a basic assumption there that we need to go tear into, and that is, what the hell is enlightenment? Because you don't even know. All you have is confirmation bias. You don't have any factual information. Yeah, it's all mental magic to you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's true. Like, uh, I've made, uh, a wager, let's say, on what the best course of action for me is to reach the end of my suffering. And based on that, I make assumptions.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, do it right now. Yeah, again, make sure that you hear it. Do it right now. Make a change to what you're doing and do it right now. Because if you can't do it now, what possibility is there you you do it later when you're not even thinking about it. Right now you're thinking about it. Do it now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** That'S the best way of becoming enlightened, is do it right bloody now. Okay, so let's define what enlightenment is so that you can understand what we're talking about here. The word enlightenment, first off, doesn't exist anywhere in the suttas.

**Speaker B:** There are some words that are in.

**Speaker C:** The sutras that they twist into the word enlightenment.

**Speaker B:** In fact, the word enlightenment is much more the Hindu word than it is the Buddhist word anyway. And so you can tear the word.

**Speaker C:** Down a bit because there's two kinds.

**Speaker B:** Of light in light. Light is That's the primary word, enlightenment. Okay, the one kind of light is.

**Speaker C:** To turn the lights on so that you can see.

**Speaker B:** Lighten up means set all of the stuff down that you saw when you turn the lights on.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Okay, so take a look at what you're doing and lighten up. Those are the two kinds of enlightenment. Why don't you do that right now?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I really get it, and I understand that it's the best possible way to live my life, like in this life. So I do understand that it's the best course of action, but still, it seems very disappointing.

**Speaker C:** But it's still— you'll forget. All right, all right, let's go for the disappointment. First off, you'll forget. That's the Sati. That's the skill that you have to develop, is Sati. Okay. And if you can remember to do it over and over and over again.

**Speaker B:** Of drop the unwholesome, set it down.

**Speaker C:** The unwholesome thoughts, pick up wholesome thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Gladden the mind, and be satisfied with this present moment over and over and over again, eventually you'll get the idea.

**Speaker C:** That you can do it, that you.

**Speaker B:** Can overcome that confirmation bias by practicing correctly enough.

**Speaker C:** So yeah, you have a new confirmation bias that's based upon actual evidence. Right now you're just disappointed because your pie-in-the-sky dream that you dreamt up, you're hearing from me is not going to be what you get. Yeah, what you dream up is not what you get.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Okay, so you become disappointed because I am shattering your dreams by pointing out reality.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Seriously, lighten up. Yeah, you can set your dreams down. You have that choice to set that stuff aside. That's actually an unwholesome thought. I could see the disappointment rush right through your face when you were trying to form the question.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** And be in the present moment. Be here now. Look what's going on now. And then make a change to that. That every— any thought that you'd ever had could be improved. Yeah, any thought of an enemy you can see as a friend. Any liar you can see as a comedian.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so that brings me to my next question. So I could do this and I could live a happy life.

**Speaker C:** No, you can't.

**Speaker A:** Oh, I can't?

**Speaker C:** No, no, you're lying to me right now. You're a comedian.

**Speaker A:** No, I mean, if I— Here's the.

**Speaker C:** Reason why I say that is because if that were true, then you would have already been doing it it before you called me, and then you wouldn't have needed to call me.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's true.

**Speaker C:** So you say I could— no, you have— you can't, because you don't. The proof is that you haven't been. Yeah, it's some practice.

**Speaker A:** It's true. Let's say I would do it hypothetically and it would all work out. Why would that be bad?

**Speaker C:** Maybe it doesn't work it out, maybe things just rot. That's what the word Anicca is all about anyway.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's good.

**Speaker C:** In China, just let it rot.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it could happen. But yeah, if I would, and it all works out in the best way we can think of, why would that be better? For example, and I'm not planning on doing this by any means, but let's say there was a drug that just has you happy all the time and has like no side effects.

**Speaker C:** You already took it. There are drugs, there's a lot of drugs. There's psilocybin, there is LSD, there's ecstasy— well, that's a big name— ayahuasca. The list goes on and on. There's all kinds of psychedelics.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** So when you say if there was a drug, no, there's plenty. They already exist.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. If you would have to practice for 70 years just to experience what you experience now for one day and then die the day after, would it still have been worth it for you?

**Speaker C:** Well, one happy day would be a whole lot better than living 70 miserable and then die.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's true.

**Speaker C:** Most people do.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Okay, back there was a bumper sticker in the 1980s: life is shit. And then you die.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so okay, let's say you could live for 70 years and you wouldn't have to put in a lot of effort, and you just make yourself as comfortable as possible, and then you die. Or you have to work really, really hard for 70 years and then get one good day in enlightenment.

**Speaker C:** Perhaps the reason that happened was because he worked, whoever you're talking about, really, really hard, and the day before he died, he finally relaxed and stopped working so hard. Yeah, and he enjoyed the day. So why don't you stop working so hard long before then?

**Speaker A:** Yeah. It should be good in the beginning.

**Speaker C:** Good in the middle, and good in the end.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** And for you, it's not good in the beginning. You don't know what the middle is, but you're all hopped up about an end that you don't have a clue about.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Oh, I was practicing and I was enjoying my practicing. Until I found out the reality as you describe it.

**Speaker C:** The reality as I describe it is actually I'm pointing out the reality that exists right in front of you. If you keep paying attention, you'll enjoy the hell out of it. So what we do is we get caught into concepts, we get caught into rules, we caught into the way that we think things are supposed to be. We get caught into the past, we get caught into the future, we believe in reincarnation this, and we're going to be that in the future, all of that kind of stuff, right? Yeah, past and future, past and future. And all you need to do is to remember to come back to this present moment, drop all of that unwholesome thought and enjoy the present moment. Be here now, as Ram Dass said.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** And he was doing a whole lot of LSD when he was Richard Alpert.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I read about that. He locked himself up for 3 weeks, I believe, doing it every day.

**Speaker C:** I'm not familiar with the details. It's been 50 years since I've read the books.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, all right, well, I think that answers my questions.

**Speaker C:** Okay, so you haven't gotten around then to asking the right question.

**Speaker A:** What is the right question?

**Speaker C:** Well, let's go back and look at the fact that you've been talking about the wrong questions that are based upon the past and some desirable future. And so the right questions would be, how do I practice right Buddhi now?

**Speaker B:** But you haven't asked.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, how do I practice now?

**Speaker C:** Well, there is the teaching of the Buddha, you know, Yeah, yeah. And he taught Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. I don't see that practice much anywhere in Buddhism. What I see practiced in Buddhism is Dukkha, Dukkha, Dukkha, take a look at the Dukkha, see that this Dukkha is related to that Dukkha, go off down that rathole of Dukkha, and when you get there at the bottom of that.

**Speaker B:** One, you'll find even more Dukkha to look at.

**Speaker C:** This is why so many of them go into something called a dark night of the soul, and boy, do they have a lot of Dukkha. Yeah, right. So why don't we see enough Dukkha so that we can get out of it immediately? Whatever little Dukkha there is, let's just see it and throw it out. Let's not take it and inspect it and deal with it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and your technique and right now. Yeah, and your technique can be learned at Wat Sanmok, right?

**Speaker C:** I don't have a technique.

**Speaker A:** You don't have technique? I heard you say that.

**Speaker C:** The Buddha taught only one kind of meditation, Anapanasati. Only one kind of meditation, that's all the Buddha taught.

**Speaker A:** No, and that's what is practiced at Wat Sammo Brat.

**Speaker C:** Those who are practicing correctly, yes, exactly.

**Speaker A:** So I heard you in your interview with Daniel Ingram on Guru Viking, I heard you saying like as a critique of the other techniques that they don't focus enough on the hindrances and overcoming them and generating joy.

**Speaker C:** That's right.

**Speaker A:** And that's what— yeah.

**Speaker C:** A number of different suttas. I can name you at least 15 suttas that talk about the removal of the hindrances, and yet the Mahasi Method does not even teach that.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker C:** So you— Christianity teaches that you can't you need a Jesus.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Because you can't deal with your own crap.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And you say that you throw out the bad, the unwholesome thoughts, and you generate the wholesome thoughts. You say that in the interview with Daniel Ingram, I believe. It's been a while since I watched it, so I'm not 100% sure. But I was wondering, like, are you then intentionally generating thoughts as in, what can I imagine what that process looks like? Can you elaborate on that?

**Speaker C:** Well, let me tell it to you this way, and that is that one of the hindrances is doubt, one of the five hindrances.

**Speaker B:** Hindrances is doubt.

**Speaker C:** We can look at the hindrances as kind of a pie that's just one.

**Speaker B:** Thing, just like a pizza pie. That pizza pie can be cut up.

**Speaker C:** Any way that you want to. The Buddha just happened to cut it.

**Speaker B:** Up in 5 ways, covering some bases. But anytime that you see it as hindrances, those hindrances work together. All right, so one of the hindrances is doubt. Another word for that is confusion. And often what that does is, because we don't like doubt and confusion, we want to have no doubt, we want to have no confusion. So now that's two hindrances right there.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, one second. Let's finish this call and take the next one.

**Speaker A:** Sure, I'll grab my charger. Tenderness.

**Speaker B:** They work together.

**Speaker C:** One thing that I just mentioned, let.

**Speaker B:** Me go back and make sure that you understand it. That is is that in this conversation today, you've asked a whole lot of questions, very little to do with Dharma, and a whole lot to do with your confirmation biases. Okay, which means that you've been in hindrances most of the time.

**Speaker A:** True.

**Speaker C:** In confusion, asking questions. What would it be like if you set all your questions down and just relaxed.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the problem is my motivation comes from— yeah, from— well, it used to come from this understanding that I had, this confirmation bias that I had. So now that that bias is gone.

**Speaker C:** People are motivated to do all kinds of things. Criminals are motivated to murder. Yes, their confirmation biases. People are motivated to run for public office because of their confirmation biases, so they will choose which party to run in, because that party is full of people who have the same confirmation bias as they do.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Damarato] Yes.

**Speaker C:** [Speaker:Larouche] So, if we can figure out that, and stop doing it, and say, "Never mind, I don't have to I didn't have any of that, I could.

**Speaker B:** Just relax and just enjoy the moment. You stop asking a bunch of questions, stop being motivated, and just relax. That's the right effort, right noble effort. I heard you talking before about hard work, hard effort. That's not noble; that's ordinary effort, based in motivation.

**Speaker C:** So, we're going to have a completely different way of doing it, is to drop your motivations and just relax. Stop being motivated, of grasping and clinging, and getting and sucking, and working, and all of that kind of stuff. And for a few minutes just practice relaxing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, like, to be honest, like, before I watched the interview that got me this doubt, I was also practicing and I was in a really relaxed state.

**Speaker C:** So you got yourself all worked up over some things that are just completely irrelevant.

**Speaker A:** Well, yeah.

**Speaker C:** And things you don't know anything about.

**Speaker A:** That's true. I don't know anything about it. Yeah. But still there is— And you can.

**Speaker C:** Be happy and satisfied that you don't know anything about it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Well, yeah. Yeah. It's like I can have energy to do something even though I have doubts. Or don't know much about it, but they're actually— yeah, for me, if you.

**Speaker C:** Would stop asking questions, I can teach you some Dhamma. But the way that we're doing it now is like a cat chasing a mouse. Yeah, and you're the cat.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay, okay. Yeah, you're right.

**Speaker C:** This mouse here to teach you anything because you're just like that.

**Speaker A:** I will stop chasing from now on.

**Speaker C:** Okay, well then we can get someplace.

**Speaker B:** Like I said, the teaching of the Buddha is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Come out of it immediately. That's what the Third Noble Truth is all about, is number one, recognize dukkha for what dukkha is. Recognize that you're creating it yourself. Then you use the Eightfold Noble Path to stop that. Then you can just relax in being, the Third Noble Truth. Nothing much to it. In fact, the Buddha was really big on nothing.

**Speaker C:** Sunyata.

**Speaker B:** Several suttas about it. Mahayana are even bigger on it.

**Speaker A:** Which sutta is that? I want to read those.

**Speaker C:** Pardon?

**Speaker A:** Can you tell me the number of the sutta so I can read it later?

**Speaker C:** Which one?

**Speaker A:** The one you were just talking about.

**Speaker C:** About the— 121 and number 122 in the Majjhima Nikaya. Marga, Upekkha. Okay, right. The Middle Link, Prison Dawn, Sutta number 121 and 122.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker C:** Okay, that's, that's two of them.

**Speaker B:** There are other places. So anyway, once you get relaxed then everything is easy. Start to work with being satisfied and feel the state of satisfaction. That's what the Buddhist teaching discussion with the word.

**Speaker C:** Dukkha. When you want things, when you're confused, when you're in pain, when you're restless, when you're worried, when you're upset of any kind, sad, angry, whatever, that's Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Because we're dissatisfied, we want something to be different there. But you can practice being satisfied. You can practice that. There have been moments that you have been satisfied, that you've been 100% If you had just waited to satisfy after the third year of birth, you probably wouldn't have lived until adulthood.

**Speaker C:** So there are times that you are satisfied, but you haven't been paying much attention to it. Now it's time to start paying attention. To start paying attention is one's right noble effort, is to look at what you're doing. And make a change.

**Speaker B:** So that's the Eightfold Noble Path. There are 5 elements of it that need to be investigated early in one's practice. The first one is.

**Speaker C:** Sati.

**Speaker A:** Anicca, would you like to say a word?

**Speaker C:** Oh, I don't have to. Okay, so now— no, no, your microphone All you have to do is just burp or swat your screen or do something to make Skype— in fact, you need to change your Skype setting to.

**Speaker A:** Have— I'll just mute myself when I'm not talking.

**Speaker C:** Okay, that'll be right. That's good. Okay, so the Second Noble Truth and the First Noble Truth work very closely together because people are taught in our society that it's someone else's fault of why I feel bad. But the Second Noble Truth points out that, oh no, all Dukkha comes from wanting things, either to go or to come, and the stupidity that we have of why we chose to feel that way. The number one point about the Second Noble Truth, the important thing, is ignorance, or stupidity, or confirmation bias, or delusion. Confirmation bias in its worst form is called delusion, denial. And so that's the ignorance, and the denial of our wanting and grasping and clinging and not seeing what's going on is going to keep Dukkha repeating and coming back and coming back and coming back. So we need to start following the path, the Eightfold Noble Path, that will give us some relief immediately, right here, right now. Just drop whatever it is that's painful and come back into a state of joy. Your choice. When you do that over and over and over again, you'll begin to believe that you can do it, that you don't need any other thing, that you know that you can put your mind into a good state. That's what we need to practice. Okay, now this is a very, very shorthand version because we spent so much of our time together with you asking this question and that question. And now that you're beginning to listen, you're beginning to figure out that there is this Eightfold Noble Path that we'll go into in detail. And the method of practice of the Eightfold Noble Path the Buddha gave—Anapanasati. He didn't give 40 meditations, he gave one. There was literature research done years ago in Hinayana to prove that that was That's correct. Only one kind of meditation was taught by the Buddha, and that is Anapanasati, which gets the mind into that state of Sukkha. You have to practice that over and over again to wake up, to remember, to look at what you're doing, and to make an improvement. Over and over and over again. This only takes a couple of seconds to do. It needs to be practiced over and over and over again. So every time a question comes up, you say, oh, I don't need to know that now. Wow, isn't it great? I don't even have to go figure it out. I could just sit here and relax instead. Stop asking many questions to yourself, because while you're asking questions, that's a state of hindrance. So see that you're asking a whole lot of questions and stop and say, okay, I can be all right right now without the answer to that question. I don't have to sit here and work myself up over something that I don't know and will not figure it out while I'm working myself up. I just accept that you don't know and you don't need to know. That in fact the need to know is a hindrance. That's the hindrance, is needing something, needing to know. You don't need to know in order to be happy. So just sit down and be happy. That's the actual practice of the Buddha. So let's finish this. If you've gotten this much out of it, perhaps you'll call again and we can go further.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, great. Very much. I'm thankful for the tips also you gave at the end. And my question is, where can I learn this Anapanasati?

**Speaker C:** Well, you can call me and we'll talk about it.

**Speaker A:** Okay, cool. And is this also taught at Watson Mook? Because I looked on their website and I think I saw Anapanasati there as well.

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, great.

**Speaker C:** Bhikkhu Buddhadasa has 4 books on Anapanasati, isn't that right?

**Speaker A:** I actually ordered one today, so Yeah, but yeah, I would be definitely interested in learning more from you. So yeah, thank you for the opportunity that I can call you again.

**Speaker C:** Okay, when are you going to call back?

**Speaker A:** Tomorrow, I think, if that's okay.

**Speaker C:** All right, you, if you want, you can join the Saturday morning call, which is Friday evening. Uh, but for you being in Chiang Mai, that would be Saturday morning at 9 AM.

**Speaker A:** Oh, so tomorrow at 9 AM? Yeah, that would be perfect. And that's from the UK Sangha then?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's the— no, it's the US Sangha, but since you're in.

**Speaker A:** The US, there it is. Okay, great. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker C:** All right, well, we'll see you tomorrow then.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, thank you so much. Bye.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, the core summary is as follows:

The central debate is about the nature of **rebirth**. Speaker A (Daniel) is interested in Buddhism primarily because of the traditional promise of ending the cycle of rebirth (reincarnation) after death. Speaker C (Dhammarato, the teacher) and Speaker B challenge this, steering the focus away from metaphysical speculation about past and future lives.

**Dhammarato's core teaching is that rebirth is a present-moment, mental process**, not a future physical one. He argues that we are constantly "reborn" into different mental states—the "Four Woeful States" of anger (hell), craving (hungry ghost), dull compulsion (dumb animal), and anxiety (fearful warrior). We choose this through ignorant, habitual reactions.

**Key Points Made by Dhammarato:**

1.  **Rebirth is Here and Now:** Enlightenment means stopping this cyclical mental rebirth *in this moment*, not in a distant future. The injunction from the suttas is "do not be reborn" *now*.
2.  **Speculation is a Hindrance:** Debating post-death reincarnation is irrelevant and a distraction. We have no evidence for it, and belief in it often stems from fear of death or desire for continuity. It prevents us from addressing current suffering.
3.  **Focus on Present Dukkha:** The Buddha's teaching is about the cessation of *dukkha* (dissatisfaction/suffering) here and now. Speaker A's focus on a future escape is a way of avoiding the dissatisfaction he is currently creating for himself.
4.  **The Practical Path:** The discussion shifts from philosophy to practice. The goal is to:
    *   **See dukkha** in the present moment (e.g., doubt, confusion, disappointment).
    *   **Drop the unwholesome state** immediately (follow the Third Noble Truth: cessation).
    *   **Cultivate a wholesome, joyful, and satisfied mind** through the Eightfold Path.
    *   This is done via **Ānāpānasati** (mindfulness of breathing), which the teacher identifies as the Buddha's primary meditation method for calming the mind and removing hindrances.
5.  **Critique of Western Buddhism:** Dhammarato is highly critical of Western translations of the suttas, which he says are often done by scholars without deep practice, leading to confirmation bias and misunderstandings of key terms like *dukkha*.

**Conclusion:** The talk is a forceful redirection from abstract, future-oriented religious belief to a pragmatic, present-moment psychology of liberation. The teacher repeatedly urges the student to stop chasing answers to unanswerable questions ("the cat chasing the mouse") and instead practice letting go of dissatisfaction and cultivating joy immediately. The real "rebirth" to be concerned with is the one happening in your mind right now.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary speaker (C, likely a teacher) uses several potent metaphors and stories to challenge the listener's (A) conventional views on rebirth and to reframe the Dhamma practice as being about present-moment mental states. Here are the key ones:

### Core Metaphors and Stories

**1. The Metaphor of Immediate, Mental Rebirth (The Central Teaching)**
*   **The Story:** The teacher redefines "rebirth" not as reincarnation after death (macro level), but as the **moment-to-moment mental states we choose to inhabit**. He lists the "Four Woeful States" as types of mental rebirth:
    *   **Hell Realm (Angry/Agitated):** Being reborn into anger and upset.
    *   **Preta Realm (Wanting):** Being reborn into craving and dissatisfaction.
    *   **Animal Realm (Dumb Animal):** Being reborn into a state of doing burdensome work you don't want to do ("That's what we call business in English").
    *   **Asura Realm (Fearful Warrior):** Being reborn into fear and anxiety.
*   **Purpose:** To shift the focus from a speculative future to observable present experience. The injunction is: **"Stop doing it right now."** You have a choice, through ignorance, to be "reborn" into these states of suffering *in this very moment*.

**2. The Simile of the Airplane on Autopilot**
*   **The Metaphor:** Living with our ingrained habits (instincts) and rules (conditioning) is like flying a plane on **autopilot**. The autopilot (our reptilian/mammalian brain) is set on a fixed course.
*   **The Story:** If you leave the plane on autopilot, it will eventually **crash into a mountain** because it cannot adapt to new circumstances (Anicca). The "pilot" is the frontal cortex—our capacity for present-moment awareness and wisdom. If we don't "take the controls" and pay attention, we crash into our "own personal hell" of negative mental states.
*   **Purpose:** To illustrate the danger of living unconsciously ("on autopilot") and the critical need for mindful awareness to navigate life and avoid suffering.

**3. The Story of the CIA and the Nuclear Documents (Translation Critique)**
*   **The Metaphor:** Translating the Pali suttas without deep understanding is like the **CIA taking stolen German nuclear documents to a high school German class** for translation.
*   **The Story:** A proper translation requires three components: fluency in the source language (Pali), fluency in the target language (e.g., English), and **deep knowledge of the subject matter** (the Dhamma itself). The teacher argues most translators lack at least two of these, leading to translations corrupted by "confirmation bias."
*   **Purpose:** To undermine the listener's literal, scripture-based belief in literal rebirth and to encourage skepticism toward popular translations that support that view.

**4. The Metaphor of Weeding a Garden / Shaving a Beard**
*   **The Metaphor:** Spiritual practice is like **weeding a garden or shaving a beard**. At first, there's a lot to clear away (gross hindrances). But even after, maintenance is required because weeds grow back and stubble returns (subtle hindrances arise due to Anicca).
*   **Purpose:** To counter the idea of enlightenment as a permanent, static state. It emphasizes the **ongoing, impermanent nature of the work**—insights and peaceful states require continuous nurturing and attention.

**5. The Six Answers to a Yes/No Question**
*   **The Story/Frame:** To break the listener's binary thinking ("Is there reincarnation? Yes or no?"), the teacher outlines **six possible answers** to such a question:
    1. Yes.
    2. No.
    3. Both.
    4. Neither.
    5. **I don't know.**
    6. **I don't know, and it's irrelevant.**
*   **Purpose:** To model a non-dogmatic, pragmatic approach. It leads the listener to the preferred conclusion: regarding literal rebirth, we must admit **we don't know**, and more importantly, **it doesn't matter** for the task of ending suffering *now*.

**6. The Parent-Child Ego / Reptilian Brain Metaphor**
*   **The Metaphor:** Our psyche is compared to a **parent-child dynamic** (akin to Freud's superego and id). The "child" is the instinctual, feeling-driven reptilian brain. The "parent" is the layer of rules and criticisms (the mammalian brain).
*   **The Story:** We grow up criticizing ourselves (parent) and feeling like a victim of that criticism (child). Humans, however, have a "pilot"—the **frontal cortex**—which can observe this dynamic with wisdom. Without using it, we remain easy to manipulate "dumb animals."
*   **Purpose:** To explain the psychological mechanism of self-created suffering (Dukkha) and to point to the part of us (awareness/frontal cortex) that can be trained to break free.

**7. The Metaphor of "Lightening Up" for Enlightenment**
*   **The Metaphor:** The teacher deconstructs the word "enlightenment" into two actionable parts:
    1. **Turning on the light:** Seeing clearly what is happening.
    2. **Lightening up:** Setting down the burdens (unwholesome thoughts) you now see.
*   **Purpose:** To demystify enlightenment, making it a practical, present-moment activity: **"Look what's going on now. And then make a change to that."**

### Summary
The teacher uses these metaphors and stories to perform a radical **reframing**:
*   **From:** Rebirth as a cosmic, post-death process to be feared or desired.
*   **To:** Rebirth as an immediate, mental event we can observe and choose to stop *right now*.
*   **From:** Practice as a long, hard effort for a future reward.
*   **To:** Practice as the simple, repeatable act of dropping unwholesome states and gladdening the mind in the present.

The overarching narrative is that speculating about distant futures is a "hindrance" that distracts from the only thing we can actually work with: our present-moment experience of suffering (Dukkha) and its cessation (Nirodha).
