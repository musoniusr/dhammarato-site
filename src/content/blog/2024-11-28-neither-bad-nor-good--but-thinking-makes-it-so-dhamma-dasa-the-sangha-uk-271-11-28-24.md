### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Recording started.

**Speaker B:** Hello, Sukkha. G'day, mate.

**Speaker C:** It's kind of funny because I noticed like it doesn't seem like anyone from the UK ever turns up to the call.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I know, like bloody Yankee. How's it Nicole? What the hell?

**Speaker C:** Funny.

**Speaker A:** That's okay.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it's just a time thing, I think.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I try to make it all really inclusive, or, you know, and anybody from any country welcome. Every Wednesday, 1 PM Central Standard Time. If possible.

**Speaker C:** It certainly suits me this time, 6 AM is good for me, because I just finished my meditation and then I'm like, "Ah, let's talk about Dharma with you guys.".

**Speaker A:** Oh nice. What type of meditation, any particular style or anything?

**Speaker C:** Just Anapanasati, just breathing meditation. Yeah. Cool, man. I've dabbled with lots of different types over the years, but that seems to be the most effective for me.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's dope. That's the Noble Eightfold Path, you know, is remembering to look, remembering that everything's okay, breathing in, sigh of relief, and relaxing. And that encompasses the whole Eightfold Noble Path. Dhammarato says it's more like a doorway because it's available here and now. Here and now, whenever we wish. Whenever we wish. So has any— has your guys' practices been going well? Any insights, any experiences this week or anything? Any trouble?

**Speaker C:** Well, trouble not in meditation, but my car broke down a couple of days ago. I'm having that, having carduka, and now I'm having bank account dukkha for how much it's going to cost me to get it fixed. But this is life, right? So that's all right, doesn't matter. Yeah, what about you? What have you been up to?

**Speaker A:** Uh, yeah, my practice has been pretty awesome lately. Even when I have the normal things that arise, like everybody— that arise in everybody's life, trials and tribulations and such.

**Speaker B:** Um, yeah, it's been pretty dope. I feel like.

**Speaker A:** Um, I'm really getting a good grasp on Kamma.

**Speaker B:** Oh, hi Ivan!

**Speaker C:** Hey Ivan! You're up late or up early?

**Speaker D:** Morning, Ivan.

**Speaker B:** He's from Thailand, right, Ivan?

**Speaker A:** I believe he's from Thailand.

**Speaker C:** I think he's in Malaysia.

**Speaker B:** Oh, is it Malaysia?

**Speaker A:** Oh, I'm sorry.

**Speaker D:** I think so.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Yeah, but yeah, we're talking about Kamma. Because Kamma can seem like such a vague concept, I feel like. But when, for myself.

**Speaker B:** It'S really the.

**Speaker A:** Natural emotions, thoughts, feelings, emotions, the Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta of the mind. I feel I used to definitely more when those things would arise, attach on to them and do something in the physical realm. That would create not only physical Kamma but also mental Kamma. That if I wasn't strong enough in my practice, not only did I make a mistake in the physical realm, but then I'm also suffering the Dukkha in my mind.

**Speaker B:** And the physical realm causes more Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** For others really but also can cause Dukkha for ourselves. But it's really worth noting that when the problems arise in the mind, you could be as angry as you want, as fearful as you want, as sad as you want, as frustrated and anxious as you want.

**Speaker B:** But as long as you don't act.

**Speaker A:** On them physically, it's almost like a superpower.

**Speaker B:** It really is quite lovely. Like, even if somebody's shitty to you.

**Speaker A:** Or whatever, it's like if you just.

**Speaker B:** Let that shit roll off, and it's like, whatever, I'm just— I could feel angry, but I'm just not I'm not gonna fucking react.

**Speaker A:** Then an hour goes by and you're.

**Speaker B:** Like, man, if I would have reacted, if I would have punched that guy.

**Speaker A:** I would be in a lot of trouble right now.

**Speaker B:** That for not only myself, but for my family and friends and the guy I punched and this and that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, just for an example. But.

**Speaker B:** Um, but it's really clear, you know, Kamma becomes something that's no longer.

**Speaker A:** This vague concept and like Oh, we.

**Speaker B:** Really can like take a step back.

**Speaker A:** And not be held hostage by our own mistakes and the consequences of those actions.

**Speaker B:** But go ahead, guys, what were you saying?

**Speaker C:** No, no, I was just going to say, yeah, reflection like that is a really good thing to do. And it's something that we often don't do with our practice, right? It's kind of like, I know there was a teacher I listened to a little bit, a guy called Ajahn Marten. Who's in the Thai Forest tradition, and he'll always say, at the end of the day, reflect on your day and see, think back on, you know, what you've done and how you reacted to things, which is exactly what you're talking about, right? And for him, that was a big part of the practice, was reflection, like reflecting on things, which I think is good. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Were you going to say something, Patrick?

**Speaker A:** I don't know if I heard you or not.

**Speaker D:** No, that was probably my dog joined me.

**Speaker B:** What kind of dog is that?

**Speaker D:** It's a Chihuahua, we believe.

**Speaker B:** Are they friendly, or are they as.

**Speaker A:** Vicious as people say?

**Speaker D:** This one is quite friendly, but she likes to chase bikes and people running.

**Speaker B:** Nice!

**Speaker C:** Yeah!

**Speaker A:** Cool, man! Yeah, those little dogs, man, they have some power behind them usually to make up for their smallness. They get— sometimes they get extra aggressive.

**Speaker B:** Not always in a bad way.

**Speaker A:** Sometimes they need to be in order to defend themselves.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and but yeah, when you see.

**Speaker A:** When you see Kamma and like as something that's real world instead of just like, of course, the mundane way of there's somebody in the sky watching me and I will reap this magical thing, you know, that I sow, which is not saying that that doesn't exist, but it's just irrelevant for the Dharma practice because nobody really knows what's going on in the metaphysical world. If one person did know, they'd be quite famous. Maybe it was Jesus.

**Speaker B:** Maybe it actually was.

**Speaker A:** Anatta or no soul or no permanent self. And as Buddhadasa Bhikkhuni would talk about it in the book Heartwood of the Bodhi Tree, it's basically an entire book dedicated to Anatta and basically getting rid of the ego.

**Speaker E:** And.

**Speaker A:** Buddhadasa Bhikkhuni acknowledges in that book that yes, yes, it means no soul, But from my understanding from reading the book, he's saying that basically they didn't have a word for the ego, you know, they didn't have a word for the selfishness, maybe aside from selfishness. But that's basically what it comes down to is this sense of entitlement, this sense of self. And Buddhadasa Bhikkhu referred to it as the head of the snake of attachments. Of negative attachments. He said, you don't have to worry about this attachment or that attachment. If you cut off the head of the snake, that solves.

**Speaker B:** All of the.

**Speaker A:** Other maybe minor attachments or minor Dukkhas that arise from these attachments. And he even went as far to say, have no concept whatsoever of the self. Erase it completely from your mind, which is not very popular even amongst our circles that we're in, in this Sangha sometimes.

**Speaker B:** But I even highlighted that line so.

**Speaker A:** I could reference it if somebody argues.

**Speaker B:** With me, like, no, he said obliterate.

**Speaker A:** All sense of self, which I like. And it doesn't have to be anything crazy to grasp. It's just basically letting go of of selfishness, letting go of wanting to hold on to something that needs validation. The head of the snake, the ego.

**Speaker B:** Its lifeblood, its nutrients is validation.

**Speaker A:** And like Dhammarato often talks about with the Garden of Eden and how it is kind of an allegory for when we're born into this perfect world, suckling from our mother's breast and having the nice protection and love from our father, if we're lucky enough to have those things. Generally most people are, but not always. Sometimes it's a grandparent or a friend or whatever. But what happens after we turn 7 or 8, it starts to become— the unconditional love starts to become very conditioned, and now we have to throw out the garbage in order to get the love and do well in our studies and go to university and get a job and all this shit. And then when we turn around 35, 40, we say, I did all the hard work, I did everything I was supposed to, where's this reward? Where's this nurturing, pure nurturing love that I had as a baby? And it doesn't show up. So people have midlife crises.

**Speaker B:** And all.

**Speaker A:** These things, trying to find that nurturing love in physical objects with no luck. And most things people do in society is a quest for validation to feed that ego. And it can be a very powerful force if you let it. People have done kind of miraculous things based on not straying from the storyline and the consistency of their ego, of their character that they developed.

**Speaker B:** You know, I even doubt some people.

**Speaker A:** Might not even, let's say, like a certain ice cream, but maybe somebody told them that they admired when they were younger, like, he likes chocolate ice cream.

**Speaker B:** Like, yeah, I like chocolate ice cream. That's the type of person I am. And sometimes I wouldn't doubt if there's people out there who, if they really question that, they might find that they like other flavors. That's how powerful sticking to a storyline.

**Speaker A:** To a character, can be. And that's how powerful sticking to superstitious beliefs can be. And the king of all superstitious beliefs is this sense of important self, this permanent self. And it's better just to do away with all of it. When you start doing acts of loving kindness and compassion, when you start not worrying about following rules, when you stop worrying about what your hierarchical level, what ring of the ladder you're at in any given group or whatever, even Sanghas, when you stop all this stuff, you really get a moment's rest. You know, you really get rest here and now. And the more you practice, the more you witness how all of these things are very illusory. They come and go just like the clouds in the sky. They don't last.

**Speaker B:** And even now, you know, these things.

**Speaker A:** Can be very subtle. Am I doing this right? Am I meeting expectations? And even if we're not thinking of if we're meeting expectations of people in this group, are we meeting expectations in our relationships in society? Are we meeting the expectations of our parents? Are we receiving the validation we so desperately worked for our whole life in many different facets of life? And the answer is usually no, we're not meeting that because it's a constant craving. It's the hungry ghost constantly needing to be validated, needing to fulfill another addiction. You know, even sitting in silence, you get bored. You're addicted to other things. We can't pay attention. It's not so easy just to sit in silence. It's not so easy just to breathe and realize everything's okay. We want to hear another magical word that will give us some hope of a greater enlightenment in the future that's not here. We want a better teacher who will.

**Speaker B:** Tell us things, and we could hold on to a better word or a better phrase that will give us some.

**Speaker A:** Openings of doors in the future. Future.

**Speaker B:** Because we can't accept right now. We can't accept the mundane reality of right now.

**Speaker A:** We see it as mundane, we see it as boredom, we see it as unsatisfactory by its very nature. Well, that's how we should see it.

**Speaker B:** And we should know that there's not a way out other than accepting it for what it is. And if you can accept Dukkha, if.

**Speaker A:** You can accept things go up and down and change all the time and they don't do what we want.

**Speaker B:** If we can accept these things, if we can realize that they have no.

**Speaker A:** Power over us.

**Speaker B:** There is a lightness.

**Speaker A:** That comes and there's a freedom that.

**Speaker B:** Comes because you're no longer held hostage.

**Speaker A:** You'Re no longer a slave by societal standards or your own ego standards.

**Speaker B:** You're free.

**Speaker A:** And you can live spontaneously. Think of any grudge you may have with other people. Think of any judgments or preconceived notions you have about reality and let them go.

**Speaker B:** See them for what they are. This person did this in the past.

**Speaker A:** This person may do this in the future. This may happen with this event in life of jobs or cars or relationships. All of it's uncertain, and whatever will be will be, you know.

**Speaker B:** So anything on your guys' mind? Anything you want to say in response to all that.

**Speaker A:** Bullshit?

**Speaker C:** That was very good, mate. Thank you. It's a nice reminder. A nice reminder, because it's easy to get caught up in— I especially get caught up at work, you know, in the hierarchical kind of— I'm kind of the longest serving person in the part of the business that I'm in. And I always have this idea that I have to know the most because I've been here the longest. So if someone comes and asks me a question, I have to know the answer. And And it's just like you say, it's just bullshit really, because I don't always know the answer sometimes. And I've got better at just saying, I don't know, just go and ask, you know. I don't have to know everything. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** God forbid we seem weak to our peers, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, God forbid we see— we let them see us as human, as, uh, as making mistakes. God fucking forbid. You know, it's good to all admit we're all fuck-ups. It's like the Buddha admitting we're just dirt, it's just elements, elements doing what.

**Speaker A:** Elements do, the mind just being natural, the mind.

**Speaker B:** But we want to, we want to be greater than the body, we want.

**Speaker A:** To be greater than the dirt.

**Speaker B:** You're not, you're not, you're fooling yourself.

**Speaker A:** And everybody else if you think I have my robe on, I have my beads, I'm very holy, I'm very this. You're not.

**Speaker C:** I've got my monk t-shirt. Hey, that's better than a robe.

**Speaker A:** It's all superstitious nonsense, just like money, just like anything else. And then if we become monks, we say, you know, like, wow, we're really something, we're really somebody. We don't have children, we don't have a family, we don't have responsibilities, we don't have societal problems.

**Speaker B:** But then if you go to a temple or wat, I'm assuming correct me.

**Speaker A:** If I'm wrong, but you may not have children, but while you're looking after your prayer bowl or pot or whatever the hell it is, you're looking after your robe, got to fold it correctly, don't want people to think I'm silly for folding my robe incorrectly. And I don't have father or family because I'm in a wat or a temple.

**Speaker B:** Oh, but there's an abbot, I better.

**Speaker A:** Make sure I bow correctly and say the right mantras.

**Speaker B:** And there's no gossip and there's no.

**Speaker A:** Frat boys in the in the temples or the monkhood or priesthood or whatever you want to call it.

**Speaker B:** But there is. You fight with your brothers, you know, there's even nuns walking around and lay.

**Speaker A:** People, you know, there's animals you get in confrontations with. Everything in society exists in these other.

**Speaker B:** Places, and that's kind of the point to me. And Buddhadasa Bhikkhu used to say when.

**Speaker A:** He was asked, can an ordinary person become enlightened?

**Speaker B:** He's like, In order to become enlightened.

**Speaker A:** You have to surpass both the householder and also the monk, because he was seeing those both as just illusory concepts, neither bad nor good, but thinking makes it so.

**Speaker B:** And that's why some teachers can be.

**Speaker A:** A bit harsh when they see that you're really clinging on to something.

**Speaker B:** It's not that they're trying to make you look foolish, but they're trying to.

**Speaker A:** Piss you off to show you how attached you are to these specific things that you hold so dear. Even concerning the Dhamma, things pertaining to.

**Speaker B:** The Dhamma, they're guidelines.

**Speaker A:** But if you start worshiping them, it's not good. Like Ajahn Samatha used to say, it's like you're in a prison cell and you have the Buddhist teaching, you know, the Pali canon.

**Speaker B:** It's like a key in your pocket, but the canon is going, "All right, here's the key, now open the door." Well, you don't open the door to your cell, you put the key on a hook on the wall and you start praying and prostrating to the key and worshiping it, saying, "No." And you read the directions, "I must twist it to the left 3 times." "Yes, 3 times." And you transcribe 3 times, I twist.

**Speaker A:** It to the left, and then you have the holy books on the directions to how to use the key on the wall.

**Speaker B:** And then you're— but you're not freeing yourself. Don't worship the hand pointing to the moon.

**Speaker A:** Don't worship the key that's supposed to unlock the door.

**Speaker B:** See it for what it is: a tool, helpful guideline.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, somebody— somebody mocks the tool, then everybody gets upset.

**Speaker B:** Oh, he's mocking the tool, the sacred tool. It's not sacred. It's useful, yes, but it's not sacred. I'm sorry, what are you saying, Lou?

**Speaker C:** No, I was just going to say it's a bit like with precepts, keeping precepts. Um, I've found, having, you know, practiced 5 precepts for a number of years now, you kind of get to a point where, like, I used to beat myself up about breaking a precept, you know, like, oh no, I've broken the first precept. I killed a worm or a mosquito or something. And obviously you're not trying to do that, but after a while you kind of, I don't know, you just sort of realize that beating yourself up about it is kind of counterintuitive, really goes against what— and someone was just commenting on Discord this morning about this exact thing, about they were kind of beating themselves up because they broke a precept. And I've just found after a while, you kind of— they become more natural to keep them anyway. But occasionally you're going to slip up because it's a training rule, right? It's a practice. It's not a, oh, I'm perfect now, I can never do this wrong. And if I do this, I'm a bad person. Because anyway, I just thought I'd comment.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Anybody else have anything to say on what Luke said?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, it's, it's, I just wanna quickly comment on what you said, Dhammarato, about the, it's a tool, I guess you said something like that. Even the Buddha talk about the simile of the raft, when you get to the other side, like, The raft is a tool, right? But we don't— it's not like we don't appreciate the tool, but it essentially in itself is a tool. I think when people start getting too much into the worshiping aspect, they lose track of what it really means. And I also— on what Luke said about the precept, really got me thinking about Like, it's so interesting because even in the Bible, Jesus, when someone asked him about the commandments, which, you know, the Christians really love, the Ten Commandments and all that, that even he's— I forgot how he phrased it, but basically it's just, uh, I mean, basically— I'm sorry, it's kind of late, so my mind's not working as well, but it's.

**Speaker C:** Just.

**Speaker E:** The value behind it, right? The— like, if you just memorize the words by words and like, oh, I have to get it to a T, you kind of lose track of what's the purpose. Yeah, of the precepts. So yeah, it's really interesting. It's a third fetter, right? Also second fetter, like the attachment to rites and rituals. That kind of stuff.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's like playing a sport. How many people have played sports here?

**Speaker B:** And have you ever, have you ever.

**Speaker A:** Just opened up a manual when you were learning to play the sport?

**Speaker B:** Were you standing, were you standing with your friends when you were learning to play football, soccer, and saying, okay guys, I got the manual, let's see, step 1 we got to kick the ball at a right angle so it fucking spins when we kick it and all this shit. No, you fucking play. But there's your friend in the corner, no, actually on page 34 we have to do this. He would get beat up if he did that.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that's true.

**Speaker B:** And that's what Dharma practice is, is an action.

**Speaker A:** It's learning to be light, not take things so seriously. You know, be joyful instead of trying to get it right.

**Speaker B:** Just try to, try to get it.

**Speaker A:** Happily, like Dhammarato says.

**Speaker B:** And that's the message, to breathe and relax. But that really seems to— sometimes people's.

**Speaker A:** Perceptions can convince them that that's not enough, you know. It's like the old Hindu stories of the guy going to the yogi and the yogi tells him he's God, but he doesn't believe that he's God.

**Speaker B:** So the yogi knows that he wants.

**Speaker A:** To go through the prostrations and go through the rituals and go through the asanas and read all the different Vedas and shit like that.

**Speaker B:** So he lets him do it for lifetimes.

**Speaker A:** You could let him do it because.

**Speaker B:** He just won't stop and be like, oh, he said I'm God, that's cool.

**Speaker A:** You know, he wants to be somewhere, he wants to get something, and he doesn't believe he has already.

**Speaker B:** And we all have peace already. Go ahead, Ivan.

**Speaker E:** Oh no, I was just saying, uh, uh, no, sorry, my mind goes blank.

**Speaker A:** Good, man.

**Speaker E:** That's actually a good Oh yeah, I remember. It's just a very quick Zen saying. I really love telling that to myself sometimes. It's, uh, you know, they say before enlightenment chop wood, carry water, yada yada, and after enlightenment chop wood, carry water.

**Speaker C:** Yada yada.

**Speaker A:** I like the yada yada version. That's nice. I've listened to more Dharma talks than anybody I've ever met, and it's amazing.

**Speaker B:** Well, you're not really saying much when.

**Speaker A:** We'Re communicating with speech.

**Speaker B:** I've heard the most beautiful speeches given. It's not much then. If you really break down all speech.

**Speaker A:** Pertaining to the Dhamma, you could break down basically the whole Pali Canon. It really is don't worry, be happy.

**Speaker B:** But that's too simple for people.

**Speaker A:** They want to be the best student, they want to be the best scholar, they want to be the best practitioner.

**Speaker B:** But you're not going to be unless you put that shit down and don't.

**Speaker A:** Take it too seriously. I've known a lot of people who can recite all the verses, and when problems come in their life, they crumble. Yeah, sometimes recovering.

**Speaker B:** Sometimes they don't make it.

**Speaker A:** When you practice correctly, the troubles come and you realize that that's just a natural part of life.

**Speaker B:** You don't even have to like them.

**Speaker A:** You don't have to not get angry. You don't have to not get fearful. If somebody you love dies, you don't have to say, I'm a Buddhist or I'm this, I can't possibly mourn.

**Speaker B:** You can experience all the thoughts, feelings.

**Speaker A:** And emotions you want. Just don't fall in love with them.

**Speaker B:** Don't fight them because you don't like.

**Speaker A:** Them, and don't become addicted to them because you're obsessed with them.

**Speaker B:** Anger comes, let it come. Don't fight it, just don't act out on it. Take refuge in the breath. Take refuge in that everything's okay here and now. And let the anger pass as its.

**Speaker A:** Natural progression in this reality.

**Speaker B:** That's how it works.

**Speaker A:** If the fear comes, if the anxiety.

**Speaker B:** Comes, and those are the easy ones to see, you know, the not so easy ones, the more subtle ones to.

**Speaker A:** See are wanting to get it right.

**Speaker B:** I want to get it right. Ah, this guy Dhamma, he doesn't know this. I want to get it right. I want the real teaching. I want to learn shit. I want to do this. That's the subtle, the subtle Dukkha, the subtle dissatisfaction of thinking that there could be something else but this, this, just this. There ain't. How old are we?

**Speaker A:** 20, 30, 40? It's always been just this, and no bullshit I'll spew from my mouth will make it anything different than just this. It's an inconvenient truth, but a truth nonetheless.

**Speaker C:** It reminds me of— there was an Anagami Kalyano quote I got the other day. I'm not sure if you're familiar with him. He's an English monk who lives in Australia, but he said, if we don't bother with snakes, snakes won't be a problem for us. The same goes for mental anxieties and restlessness. Thoughts. If we don't get involved with them, they will arise and cease on their own. So it's pretty much what you're saying, like with anger and with those things, is just don't— yeah, don't try and get rid of them. Just let them come and go on their own. We don't have to hang on to them, get involved with them. Just let them come and go. It's difficult, but it is.

**Speaker B:** And a lot of spiritual people Nowadays.

**Speaker A:** It'S become popular to— if I manifest things, you know, if I can control my environment, then that'll really be something. And if I— this self-love, which is basically selfishness in disguise.

**Speaker B:** If I love myself, if I could.

**Speaker A:** Become more selfish, then this is true spirituality. It's so silly.

**Speaker B:** Jesus was a good example. You know, when people who are Christians.

**Speaker A:** Follow Jesus, who are true Christians follow.

**Speaker B:** Jesus, They learned from the examples in.

**Speaker A:** The Bible and his followers that just.

**Speaker B:** Because they worshiped Jesus and listened to.

**Speaker A:** His message of peace and love, it's.

**Speaker B:** Not like they were spared from the.

**Speaker A:** Trials and tribulations of life. John the Baptist was beheaded. Some of the apostles were filleted, their flesh filleted off their body, crucified upside down, burnt alive. Most of them.

**Speaker B:** Jesus himself was crucified. It doesn't mean that when you have this Dhamma, Holy Spirit, that everything in your life's just not gonna bother you anymore. It comes, it fucks with you just like everybody else. You'll get good shit in life, you'll get bad shit, but you no longer see it as good or bad. You no longer see it as being and becoming. You just see it as a natural.

**Speaker A:** Phenomenon that arises and passes. Nothing more.

**Speaker B:** So what can I do? I have this problem. Well, you try to fix it the best you can and you fucking move on, like you have since you were a baby. How many problems have we worried about in our life? And we try the best we can and then they either work out or they don't, or we find another way to do it. It's no biggie. It's not rocket science. People with far less IQ than us who are doing just fine probably have.

**Speaker A:** Less problems than—.

**Speaker B:** That'S why some people are too damn smart for their own good.

**Speaker A:** That monkey mind is never at rest. I remember the singer from Linkin Park.

**Speaker B:** I forget his name, Chester— Chester Bennett.

**Speaker E:** Was it Parker? I can't remember, but Chester something.

**Speaker B:** He passed away, but he used to say, man, you don't want to be in my mind.

**Speaker A:** You wouldn't last a day in my mind. It's not a fun place to be.

**Speaker B:** And, you know, he's speaking about his.

**Speaker A:** Mental illness and his Dukkha that he's experiencing. And.

**Speaker B:** As if that was.

**Speaker A:** Something that not many people experience, you know. But we hang on to that Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** We hang on to those addictive attachments.

**Speaker A:** And the hell becomes concrete, real in the mind. It solidifies in the mind very— it can be perceived to be very difficult to get away from. And some people don't make it like.

**Speaker B:** Him, but it's not like, oh, this is his fault.

**Speaker A:** It's just things that happen in reality. It's nobody's fault. It's nobody that's to blame. Just the way things are.

**Speaker E:** Something I keep coming back to, it's a very simple saying, right? We suffer more in our head than in reality, it just speaks more and more true to me. Because, you know, the objective reality, like you said, it is just what it is. Kind of, you know, like you said, just this. It's Bhikkhu Bodhisattva actually plays a lot, like he spends some effort into really trying to get people to understand what Tathagata really actually is. I think he kind of— he said something about like, if you really know like how deep— did he say how deep? But something around that line that Tathagata really means that you arrive at the peace or something like that. Like, I really love it. Like, actually, like for me, Tathagata is like so mysterious, right? It just boils down to just this, but it feels very limitless to me, like, you know, in a good way. Like, because like we try to overthink, right? We try to like understand things and like get control, or even managing Dukkha or something like that. But when you just boil it down to just this, you just throw everything away and just Everything is okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and we have to be mindful too of not getting so overly zealous with spiritual teachers. Even Dhammarato himself said he loved Buddha Dasabhikkhu, he loves the Buddha, but they stand on clay feet, meaning they're great.

**Speaker B:** But at the end of the day.

**Speaker A:** Also they're just kind of conceptual notions and guidelines. And we have to be adults and.

**Speaker B:** We have to see for ourselves that these guidelines that the Buddha gave us, what was he saying?

**Speaker A:** Do they work? We put them into practice and once we know for ourselves, we're no longer dependent on Buddha, we're no longer dependent on Buddha Dasabikkhu, we're no longer dependent on Dhammarato, we're no longer dependent on other people. We become independent. You know, people can tell me that Kamma is this, Kamma is that, Kamma is this, but for myself, when I.

**Speaker B:** See that if I do a negative.

**Speaker A:** Action in this physical realm, the consequences follow me.

**Speaker B:** If I don't do negative physical actions.

**Speaker A:** In this realm, there are no problems.

**Speaker B:** There's just bad habits.

**Speaker A:** That's Samskara.

**Speaker B:** Kamma is a kind of Samskara. It's an action, it's a bad habit.

**Speaker A:** An action born out of the bad habits that subtly make its way into the spiritual realm inside of us. We take these dukkhas and this tiger, like Buddha Dasabikkhu said, you don't have to fight the tiger, you don't have to fight the dukkha or the cravings. You just starve them with Sati and Anapanasati. If something arises, you take shelter in Anapanasati. You can even chant if you want.

**Speaker B:** And these things will pass. At the end of the day, that's.

**Speaker A:** The only thing that I'm saying. Dharma practice is an action. It's the action of when Dukkha arises, you're taking shelter until the Dukkha passes. That's how we deal with Dukkha. It's not saying a magical word that gets rid of the Dukkha forever. That's not reality. Even the Buddha saw Mara come back on his deathbed, but he knew how to take shelter until Mara— he saw Mara for what she was, is illusory, passing, a passing phenomenon, nothing more, nothing less. That's all we're doing. That's all we're doing. Taking shelter in the breath. Taking shelter in right here, right now, realizing everything's okay. That's the Noble Eightfold Path. That's what we teach. That's what I teach. That's what the Buddha taught. And when you practice it, you see.

**Speaker B:** For yourself that it really is that simple.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Well, anybody else have anything they want to say before we get going?

**Speaker E:** I have a quick non-Dharma related question. I'm curious. No, because I remember the first time I see you, you have a very long beautiful beard. I was just curious, are you gonna grow it this year?

**Speaker A:** Oh, I don't think I'm gonna grow it.

**Speaker C:** It.

**Speaker B:** Um, it would like— I would accidentally pull hairs out when it was very long.

**Speaker A:** It became kind of annoying, although it was great because it kept me warm though.

**Speaker E:** I was just thinking about it because it's like near the winter season and I thought that you're gonna grow it out.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, maybe I should, man. I don't know, we'll see what happens.

**Speaker A:** We'll see what happens.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you should grow one with me.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, if I could.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you can do it. We should all grow beards in the Sangha.

**Speaker E:** Oh, in the beard group, the beard.

**Speaker B:** Bros. Yeah, Buddha beard dudes. Well, yeah, go ahead, Luke.

**Speaker C:** I'm going to India next week. For 3 weeks doing— going to like pilgrimage.

**Speaker A:** Oh sweet, dude.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it should be an experience. I suspect whatever happens, it'll be an experience. Um, so yeah, I won't be around for— I might not— I probably won't be on calls for a few weeks.

**Speaker A:** So that's okay, man.

**Speaker C:** I'll see you when I get back.

**Speaker B:** I've done many, many weeks, many a.

**Speaker A:** Weeks with nobody showing up.

**Speaker B:** I'm quite seasoned in whatever happens, happens.

**Speaker A:** So don't you worry.

**Speaker C:** Thanks for the reminder tonight.

**Speaker B:** And Patrick, Patrick, you good? You got anything to say before we go?

**Speaker D:** No, it's all right.

**Speaker A:** Nice, nice.

**Speaker B:** All right, brothers, you rock, dude.

**Speaker C:** Take it easy, guys.

**Speaker B:** Peace out, guys.

**Speaker E:** Bye. Cheers.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends, revolves around practical, down-to-earth Buddhist practice, emphasizing letting go of dogma and finding peace in the present moment. Here’s a summary of the key themes:

**Core Teaching: The Simplicity of Practice**
- The heart of the practice is **Ānāpānasati** (mindfulness of breathing) — remembering to breathe, relax, and see that everything is okay here and now. This simple act embodies the Noble Eightfold Path.
- The Dhamma is a **tool for liberation**, not an object of worship. Clinging to scriptures, rituals, or teacher worship is compared to admiring a key instead of using it to unlock a door.

**Kamma (Karma) as Practical Cause and Effect**
- Kamma is demystified: it’s the immediate, observable result of our **mental and physical actions**.
- The “superpower” of practice is learning to **feel difficult emotions (anger, fear, anxiety) without acting on them**. By not reacting physically, we avoid creating harmful new kamma and extra suffering.

**Anattā (Not-Self) and Cutting Off the Ego**
- The concept of *anattā* is presented as **releasing selfishness and the sense of a fixed, important self**.
- Using Buddhadasa Bhikkhu’s analogy: the ego is the **“head of the snake”** of all attachments. Cut it off, and other attachments lose their power.
- Much of life’s suffering stems from the **craving for validation** and clinging to a “storyline” about who we are.

**Precepts and Practice Without Perfectionism**
- Precepts are **training guidelines**, not absolute rules. Beating yourself up for breaking one (like accidentally killing an insect) is counterproductive.
- The spirit of the precepts matters more than rigid, literal adherence.

**Accepting “Just This”**
- Peace comes from **accepting reality as it is** — uncertain, changing, and often unsatisfactory (*dukkha*).
- The goal isn’t to eliminate all unpleasant feelings, but to **stop fighting them and let them pass naturally** without getting involved. As one member quoted: “If we don’t bother with snakes, snakes won’t be a problem for us.”
- **“Just this”** — the ordinary present moment — is where freedom is found, not in a future enlightenment or special experience.

**Warning Against Spiritual Materialism**
- The talk cautions against turning spirituality into another **quest for achievement, status, or special identity** (e.g., being the “best” student, a “holy” monk, or a knowledgeable scholar).
- Even in monasteries, human problems like hierarchy, gossip, and conflict exist. **True practice surpasses the roles of householder and monk**.

**Conclusion: The Dhamma as a Refuge in Action**
- The ultimate practice is **taking refuge in the breath** when suffering arises — not as a magic cure, but as a way to wait out the storm until it passes.
- This independence in practice means **verifying the teachings for yourself** and not being dependent on any teacher, text, or group.

The conversation is informal, humorous, and grounded in everyday challenges (car trouble, work hierarchies, dog ownership), reinforcing the idea that Dhamma practice is about engaging with ordinary life with wisdom, lightness, and ease.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary speaker (Speaker A, likely the facilitator/Dhammarato) uses several core metaphors and references stories to explain Buddhist concepts. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors:**

1.  **The Head of the Snake:** Used to describe the ego or sense of self (*atta*). The speaker references Buddhadasa Bhikkhu's teaching that you don't need to fight every individual attachment (the body of the snake); if you cut off the head (the ego/self), all other attachments lose their power.
2.  **The Key and the Prison Cell:** Used to describe the danger of clinging to Buddhist teachings themselves. The Dhamma (teachings, Pali Canon) is a key meant to unlock the door of suffering. The problem is when people start worshipping the key (the texts, rituals) instead of using it to actually open the door and free themselves.
3.  **The Raft (referenced by Speaker E):** A classic Buddhist simile (from the *Majjhima Nikaya*) mentioned by another participant. The Dhamma is like a raft used to cross a river (suffering). Once you reach the other shore (awakening), you don't carry the raft on your head; you let it go. It's a tool, not an object of worship.
4.  **The Hungry Ghost:** Used to describe the constant, insatiable craving for validation and fulfillment. The ego is likened to a hungry ghost that is never satisfied, always seeking something more.
5.  **Starving the Tiger:** Another reference to Buddhadasa Bhikkhu. You don't need to fight negative mental states (the tiger) directly. Instead, you "starve" them of attention by taking shelter in mindfulness and the breath (*Anapanasati*), and they will pass away on their own.
6.  **Clouds in the Sky:** Used to describe the illusory and transient nature of societal concerns, hierarchies, and ego-driven stories. They come and go, but they don't last and aren't fundamentally real.
7.  **Playing a Sport:** Used to argue that the Dhamma is a practice, not just an intellectual study. You don't learn to play soccer by reading a manual page-by-page with your friends; you just play. Similarly, the Dharma is an action to be lived lightly and joyfully.
8.  **Clay Feet:** Used to caution against over-idealizing spiritual teachers (even the Buddha). They stand on "clay feet," meaning they are human, fallible, and their teachings are conceptual guidelines, not ultimate objects of dependency.

### **Stories / Allegories:**

1.  **The Garden of Eden as an Allegory for Conditioned Love:** The speaker presents a psychological interpretation of the Garden of Eden story:
    *   **Paradise:** The unconditional love and nurturing of infancy.
    *   **The Fall:** The point (around age 7-8) when love becomes conditional based on performance, chores, grades, etc.
    *   **The Quest:** The subsequent lifelong search to regain that lost unconditional love through validation, achievement, and material objects (leading to mid-life crises).
    *   **The Point:** This story illustrates how the ego's craving for validation is formed and drives much of human suffering.

2.  **The Ice Cream Story:** A brief anecdote to illustrate how people cling to a constructed self-identity ("storyline"). Someone might believe they like chocolate ice cream because they adopted that identity early on, and they stick to it rigidly without questioning if it's still true, demonstrating the power of the ego's narrative.

3.  **The Yogi and the Seeker (Hindu Story):** A story about a seeker who goes to a yogi and is told "You are God." The seeker doesn't believe it and insists on going through lifetimes of rituals, prostrations, and studies. The yogi allows this because the seeker is unable to simply accept the truth that peace and divinity are already present. This illustrates how people complicate the simple truth of "just this" with spiritual seeking.

4.  **The Fate of Jesus and the Apostles (Referenced Example):** Used to make the point that following a spiritual path (like the Dhamma or the teachings of Jesus) does not spare one from the "trials and tribulations" of life. True practitioners face suffering (crucifixion, persecution) but their relationship to it changes—they no longer see it as purely "good" or "bad," but as a natural part of existence.

**Overall Theme:** The metaphors and stories consistently point toward a core message: **Stop complicating spirituality.** Let go of the ego (the snake's head), use teachings as practical tools (the key, the raft) not objects of worship, see through transient stories (clouds, ice cream preferences), and find peace by simply taking shelter in the present moment ("just this") through the breath.
