### Transcript


**Speaker A:** And the thing that's interesting is that I've never met anyone who was that kind of unique or that kind of personal. So when people talk about having something personal, that indicates to me that, oh well, they just have something that everybody else has, and everyone thinks that they're the only one who has that. The kind of selfishness. So anyway, David, welcome to our talks here. And we can begin by talking about the actual practice itself and the reasons and rationales for it. Because most people have been educated to a degree in Western Buddhism. And as we had mentioned before, Western Buddhism has incorrect definitions for almost all the important words. Words like Samadhi, words like Anatta, Words like Nibbana, all kinds of words, even the word— you can see how Christianized everything has gotten because they use the word monk. And because they use the word monk, they assume that Buddhist monks are something like Christian monks. And in fact, when I was at Wat Greensboro in North Carolina, there was a Christian monastery about 50 miles away. And a lot of people would wind up going to both, and they just didn't understand that they were different. The monks, the Christian monks, they've got a schedule. They're busy all day long. They have certain time. I mean, they live by the clock. To where the Buddhist monk, the only time of day is lunch. Yeah, and so, um, there is no activities planned or scheduled to work with the Christians. They've got Vespers, they've got prayer, they got this, they've got that, and everybody's got to go to work all at the same time, um, to where, uh Within the concept of Buddhist teaching, everything is free. Time is free. Nothing is heavy. There's nothing to do. So all of these translations, all of these words that we have within— when Westerners begin to get involved with Buddhism, they get a whole list of words that are wrongly understood. And so the first thing that we can come to, in fact, the first word that we'll really look at in the sense of wrong translation, is the word Dukkha. Because the Buddha has said in several different suttas that he only teaches one thing, both formally and now. I teach only Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Well, now the Christians got a hold of that word Dukkha and they says, what are we going to do with that? Oh, we know some Dukkha. Got a dude here that's got nails and crosses and that kind of stuff. It must be suffering because he really suffers. And if you suffer enough, you'll get the grace of God and forgiveness and all of that kind of stuff. And so they called it suffering. Dukkha is suffering, where in fact the word dukkha doesn't mean that at all. What it means is inherently unsatisfying. We're not inherently, but we choose to see things as unsatisfying, unsatisfactory. And that's a judgment based upon ourselves. That actually is the same thing as the teaching in the story of Adam and Eve in Genesis, where Adam and Eve ate of the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil. What does eating of the fruit mean? That means that they've got to put up with the results of their judgmental mind. And by making judgments— this is good, this is bad— they were in paradise, you see. They were in paradise. And here they go around saying, I like that tree and that one's evil. If you start finding evil trees in paradise, you've destroyed paradise by calling it evil, right? That's how you get thrown out of paradise, is by calling it evil. All right, so that's the whole point of Dukkha, is being dissatisfied with what things are. And Dukkha, Nirodha means coming out of that dissatisfaction immediately, coming out of it right now. Drop it right now. And yet Western mentality has the idea of Dukkha, Dukkha, Dukkha, more Dukkha. I've got to put up with Dukkha. I've got to investigate dukkha, and I'll probably die with dukkha, okay? And if I'm very, very lucky, and it's very, very rare, and I'm one person out of however many there's been in the past 400 or 500 years, I'll be the first one who is free from dukkha eventually. And that's the way that people look at it, all right? And that's not the way that the teaching of the Buddha is at all. The teachings of the Buddha is Dukkha. Dukkha, Nirodha, because you can make that change right now. You make that change immediately because you're able to see the Dukkha and you step around it. So imagine then that the Dukkha that we're talking about here is like a cow pie, and that we've got a pasture here and all the cows are way on the other side of the the pasture. If the farmer wants to go to these cows, if he in fact goes to the cows watching where they are, they might move a little bit, and so he's watching the cows to make sure that he can get to them. By the time he gets to those cows, he's going to be covered in cow shit because he's not watching where he's going. He's not watching every step. He's looking at the cows. He's off in the future, okay? He's goal-oriented, and because he's goal-oriented, he's not watching what he's doing right now. He needs to watch where he's going to put his next footfall because it might be a cow pie or a snake, right? All right, so this is how we're beginning to understand. Practice is Dukkha. Dukkha, Nirodha means change the mind right now. And this takes effort. When we begin, there is an effort. It requires an effort. But once we get on a roll, we recognize that, oh, there was nothing to it. That it becomes easy. That in fact, that's what we're beginning to do is to take the struggle out of things. Because the struggle is due to dissatisfaction. If you're already satisfied with things, then where's the struggle? And so one's right effort is to change our attitude, to change our mind, to change our thoughts from unwholesome thoughts into wholesome thoughts. That's basically all there is to the practice. Not much to it. And yet most Westerners struggle. They note, they work hard, they sit, they want something. And because they want something, they don't get it.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, what does that mean they don't get it? Is that getting it means that they don't want it anymore, and yet they still want, and they still want, and they still want. They haven't gotten to the point of being satisfied. And the first part of that means that we need to learn to be satisfied even if we don't get what we want. And then we begin to look at the wanting, and then we can recognize, oh, I can change. If I can change becoming satisfied even if I don't get what I want, then I can begin to change what I want. And if I don't want anything at all, if I want nothing, then there's nothing to do, no place to go.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** And so this is the actual practice. Now, uh, this teaching of Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha breaks down into then immediately into the Four Noble Truths. There is Dukkha, it exists. Now many people think that life itself is Dukkha. No, life itself is not Dukkha. If I had you by the throat and gave you the option of I can either choke you now or I'll just keep my hands on your throat for 5 minutes and then I'll choke you to death, which would you choose? To die now or to get another 5 minutes?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** That means that life itself is not Dukkha, but we cling to it so strongly. In fact, life itself is the best gift. That's the best thing that we've got, and we need to learn to appreciate it and become satisfied with it, satisfied with being alive. That in fact, every breath that you've taken up until this point has gotten you here to where you're still alive. It doesn't matter what screw-ups or what bad things that you've done in the past. You're still here, you're still alive. Congratulations.

**Speaker B:** I don't know how I did it.

**Speaker A:** Congratulations for still being alive. Well, you don't appreciate that. That's why I'm trying to get you to congratulate yourself for the fact that you're still alive. So life itself is not Dukkha, now is it?

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker A:** Ah, but somewhere along the line, Buddhists got associated with life itself as Dukkha. And I've seen bumper stickers that go something like, life is shit, and then you die. Well, life is not shit. You could say that life sucks, but the only reason that life sucks is because we're the one who does the sucking. If you keep sucking on stuff, then your life sucks. When you stop sucking, your life don't suck no more. I know, I'm quite an expert at that. I once sucked a Mercedes-Benz SL500 through a straw. I sucked it right up. What did I suck? So that indicates that there's got to be a reason for this stuff. The Second Noble Truth. The Second Noble Truth is, is that there is a cause for Dukkha. Now, the Mahayana have got it down very simple. They just think that clinging, or Tanha, is suffering, wanting things. But that's not actually the way that the Buddha described it, and it's actually not complete. That the important point is that Dukkha is caused by ignorance, or in our language, stupidity, like this farmer who is so stupid that he's not even watching where he is stepping because he's so interested in getting to his cows. That he's not watching where he's going. And so this is the cause of suffering, is that we're not watching what we're doing. We're ignorant. We don't see. So if there is greed and we do not see it, it's going to cause Dukkha. If there is ill will, if we don't like something, that's Dukkha itself. If we can see that that's Dukkha itself, we can make a change for it. So this is the whole point of the Second Noble Truth, is the cause of suffering means that we need to pay attention to Dukkha and what causes it. Stupidity and stupidity and stupidity and wanting things that we don't have and are too stupid to recognize that, hey, I'm in a state of wanting when I want something I don't have. And if I'd stop wanting something that I don't have, I'd be okay.

**Speaker B:** But we can't. That's the problem. Like, we can't— most people cannot see that they're okay, right?

**Speaker A:** Right. Well, they've been trained since childhood that they're not okay, that all love is conditional. Mommy and Daddy's love is unconditional when the baby is born and the baby gets nurtured and nurtured and nurtured. But by the time the child is 2, 3, or 4 years old, now the child is put to work. He's either Mommy's little helper or he's going to school or he's put as a table waiter or something. And now all of our love becomes conditional. And that's the environment that we're raised in. Is raised on conditionalities, that you do not get, let us say, the grace of God until you suffer enough, rather than recognizing, no, the grace of God is right here. Here it is, up to you. Can you either see it and become aware of it, or you're going to stay ignorant to it and wanting something else, saying, well, the grace of God I don't know about, but at least I can have a girlfriend or a car or a motorcycle or a job or whatever it is that we want, not recognizing we've already got everything that we need with this breath. That in fact, whatever it is that you want or need is probably not going to kill you to do without it, at least not for a while. I mean, you can even go for— people have fasted for many times longer than 30 days. And so food You can do without for a while. Water, you can do without that for a few days. How long can you go without breathing? In fact, you've got a death sentence. That death sentence is only 2 minutes from now, unless you're well trained, and then it's 3 or 4 minutes. But if you don't breathe, you're going to die. So breath itself is life itself. And this is why Anapanasati is so valuable. So if in fact we can see the greed, the ill will that we have, and drop it, then we can be okay, we can be all right, we can be free from it. This is the Third Noble Truth. Now, in Western Buddhism, they think that this freedom from Dukkha is something almighty and spectacular, to where in fact you're free from Dukkha several times a day, at least. Like when you sit down to a meal or after you've chewed some food and swallowed, there will be moments and points of time when you're completely satisfied. You're not thinking about something that you don't have. But funny thing, when people sit down to meditate, all of a sudden now they're thinking about things that they want, things that they don't have, things that you're trying to do, attainments, Sotapanna, enlightenment, Nibbana, all kinds of things that they want that they can't have. Right. And so what we have to do then is learn to practice correctly. This is where we come into the Four Noble Truths leading into the Eightfold Noble Path. Now, the Eightfold Noble Path is described in the suttas is when the Buddha says, monks, I will teach you about right unification of mind with its supports and features. This is a very, very heavy-loaded statement. If you can remember this, monks, I will teach you about right unification of mind with its supports and features. Now, what do we mean by right unification of mind? The mind that is unified and not in a fight, not in an argument, not in a division, but unified. This is also in the words that we have in English would be someone of integrity, someone who is honorable, someone who acts nobly. He does not have conflicts of interest. All right, but most of us have conflicts of interest. I want to go in there and I want to go out there, and as soon as I want to go in there, I have the thought I want to go out there, and now I'm in a conflict. Or I have the conflict in the sense of I've got a rule that I should follow. You ought to go on a diet, say, or you ought to stop smoking, or whatever it is. And then the other part of us says, I don't want to stop smoking, I don't want to go on a diet. And so now we're in a fight, we're in an internal dialogue, and both sides are unhappy, uncomfortable, dissatisfied. One is dissatisfied because we're not following the rules, and the other part of us is dissatisfied because there are rules to follow. And so what we're going to be doing is working for getting the mind unified, bringing all the parts to the mind together. And when the various parts of the mind are together, when there are the features that are there, then the mind would be unified. And yet this word that we're talking about, this unification of the mind, the Pali word is Samadhi, and Samadhi is always translated as What? Concentration. Yes, concentration. And yet this has got nothing to do with concentration. That's a bad translation, that we're not trying to concentrate the mind, we're trying to unify the mind. Concentrating the mind says, well, I'm going to keep this part and I'm going to throw that part out. I'm only going to keep this part. To where the whole point with the Buddhist teaching is, no, we have to integrate and unify the mind. And so by unifying the mind, it's going to have supports and features. The features of the mind have to do that when the mind is unified, when it is whole and wholesome, it doesn't want anything. It's not in the state of wanting something that it doesn't have. So if you don't want anything at all, then you're very unlikely to go out and harm someone or kill someone to get it. It's very unlikely if you don't want anything to go take it. It's very unlikely that if you don't want anything to go gossip about it, or gossip about people who do have it, or gossip about people who don't have it. If you don't want anything, there's no gossip, there's no lies. That in fact you could see that if you are lying, that that lie is actually a division. The mind is broken apart and you're suffering with the truth and the not-truth, that you don't like the truth and you want the not-truth to be true enough to where you're going to state that the not-truth is true. This is a disintegration of the mind. Disintegration, falling apart. And so we're a mess. We're a crowd. Everybody is a crowd. And what we need to learn to do is to become unified and whole again. Okay. And so let's look at the supports for this unification of mind and the support for the unification of the mind is Starting with right view, right noble view comes first. But right noble view is a skill. It's a skill to be developed. Well, you already called, so that means that you have some right noble view already, just a little, because you recognize enough Dukkha that you want to call. All right, so there's the beginning. That's the bud of it. We've got some right noble view going. The next item on the list is right noble remembering, the word Sati. Now, even though the Buddha says that right view comes first, because technically it does, the most important one is right Sati, to remember. Because it doesn't matter what skills you have if you forget to apply those skills when you need them. Then those skills are of no value. You have to remember, this is what Sati is all about, is to come back and to come back and to remember to come back and to keep coming back, coming back to the present moment, coming out of the Dukkha, back into the reality of the thing. This is what the waking up is all about, to wake up into the reality of the moment, which means coming out of all of our thoughts What are your general thoughts about the past, thoughts about the future, thoughts about someplace else, thoughts about other people who are not here? That in fact, most of our thoughts are thoughts of concepts and conceptualizations. That right now, your world is inside the four walls of that room that you're in, because that's the extent of your vision and your hearing. That's the extent of the odors that you smell, of the odors that are in the room that you're in. And when you're in that room alone, there you are. But if someone else comes into that room, now you're going to be divided between who you are and who they are. And so we have to recognize that our world, our real world, is only as small and only assigned to the senses. If you're close enough to sense it with the senses, then it's real and it's in your world, and everything else is a concept between your ears. So when we talk about Washington, DC, for instance, or Moscow— Moscow and Washington, DC are just concepts. President Putin and President Biden and President Trump and President this, that, and the other thing, for you and me, are just concepts. And not only that, but our concepts are built upon not reality, but concepts that we got from other people who got their concepts from other people. And there's not much reality going on anywhere.

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker A:** All right, so what we're going to do now is we're going to start paying attention. We're going to remember to look at what's real right in front of us, or right here. That's what the real practice of the Eightfold Noble Path is, is to remember to look at what's going on. To remember to look to see, is this Dukkha or not? Are you comfortable? Are you afraid? Are you uncomfortable? Are you satisfied? These are the kind of things that we're going to do with the investigation to begin to see what's really going on. And then Once we can see what's going on, we now have the choice to make a change. This is one's right effort. One's right effort is to make the change that is needed to come out of the Dukkha, come out of the concepts, and come into the present moment and enjoy this next breath, enjoy being alive, enjoy being right here, right now. Now, this is— we begin to practice this by first off recognizing that many of the thoughts that we have are unwholesome. They're unwholesome because they're conceptualizations. They're about the past. They're about the future. They're about other people who are not here. They're about other places that are not here. And so this is the kind of thinking that we do, and we're going to call all of that kind of thinking unwholesome. Because it's not about what's going on right here, right now. And so changing the kind of thoughts that we're having from out there, over yonder, down under, or whatever, and start having thoughts about what we're doing right here, right now. Thoughts about the breathing, thoughts about the body, thoughts about the touch of the skin, thoughts about the smells that we have, thoughts about the hearing that we have. And we just come into the paradise that we already live in rather than the jungle that is the mind's concepts about the paradise. These are the first 3 items on the Eightfold Noble Path: Right View, Right Effort to change, and Right Sati to remember, to look, and to make a change. Now, the effort in the beginning for the students is a lot of effort. It takes effort to make these changes. But after you begin to get some skill at it, the effort becomes easier. One of the things that will help the effort is the waking up. If you really, really wake up and really, really see the Dukkha, then it doesn't take so much effort to come out of it. But if you only wake up a little bit to see the Dukkha a little bit, and then we don't have the effort to come out of it, we'll kind of put up with it. It's okay. In other words, we have the kind of, how to say it, unthunk thought that it's more work to change and the benefit is not worth the effort. That's true for the beginner, but if you keep practicing and keep changing, then the changing gets easier because now the skill is that we can see Dukkha in ways that we couldn't see it before. But there's another point to it, and that is step 4 of Anapanasati, or actually the Eightfold Noble Path. Step 4 is what is referred to in Nepali as Samma Sanghappa. That is translated incorrectly as right thought, and more correctly as right intention. But another way of looking at it is the mind has a leaning, and you know that woodcutters, if they can get a tree to lean in a certain direction, then when they cut the tree down, it will fall in the direction that it's leaning. All right, well, our own mind does that too. Whichever direction that we're leaning, that's the direction that we're going to fall. And so what we need to do then is start to make some changes or corrections to this attitude. That's what we're— another word that we can use besides intention would be attitude. I use the word niggle. Another one would be an expectation, something like that, that only lasts about a tenth of a second. It only takes one mind moment for an attitude. Now, mostly the attitude that people have is the attitude of a victim, the attitude of a loser, the attitude that work is hard, the attitude that the struggle is big, the attitude that the effort is too much.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I think I lost you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** When we were children, we still were under the— Oh, welcome back.

**Speaker B:** Okay, there we go.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yes, that we start off as, uh, victims. A tender infant can't take care of itself, is completely at mercy to its environment. As young children, we stay in that dependent position, that when we walk, we got to hold somebody's hand, and their hand is— so we got to hold our arm up in the air just to hold somebody's hand, and we don't have a choice about it. We got to do what we're told to do. And so we start off as victims. What this practice of Anapanasati is, is the practice of changing that attitude from being a victim into being a winner. And this is how it is accomplished over time. When we keep changing our thoughts from unwholesome thoughts to wholesome thoughts over and over and over again and begin to get the benefit of that, we begin to change the attitude of, hey, I can do this. Hey, I can feel good. Hey, I don't have to be dissatisfied all the time because I can see that I can put myself into a state of satisfaction. Yippee-ki-yay, I can do this. And we begin to change our attitude, and when we change it sufficiently, we can think of it as the lion. The Buddha was known as a lion. That's the attitude that we're developing, the attitude of you can do this, the attitude of I've got this wired, the attitude that it doesn't matter what happens, even my own death, I can handle it well. And so we begin to develop this attitude. This is the part, then, that with these four things of right viewing, right Sati, to remember to look, right effort, to change, and then the appreciation of that change, the knowledge of that change, that yes, we can change. Yes, I am not stuck in who I used to be. This is where the word anatta actually has some value, is because you recognize if you do change, you're not the same person as you were before. And if you believe in a soul, that the soul can't change I mean, Christianity works really hard to try to prove to you and teach you that you can't change. Look at the scriptures. In Romans it says, who are you to be good? Only God is good. Another one is, except you accept Jesus as your savior and thou shalt be saved. But if you don't take Jesus as your savior, you're stuck. You're fucked, you're lost, you're going to go to hell. And in fact, the reality is, is that you're already in hell. And so this is where the Samma Sanghappa really has the power coming into where it's the attitude now that I can change. I am not stuck. That's not who I am anymore. I can make a change here. And the change is for the better because that's the intention. So this is the actual practice of Anapanasati, or actually the practice of the Eightfold Noble Path. And we use Anapanasati to practice this Eightfold Noble Path. Now, let's go back to the beginning for just a moment and look at view. Right Noble View Uh, there's, there's two ways of looking. One is the looking at it in the sense of a noun, and the other one is a verb. When we think of wrong view, that's often always a noun, and it's stated in the sense of, uh, I can get away with it, I can go do what I want to do, I want something bad enough that I can go get it, and I can get away with and not have to suffer the consequences of my bad behavior in getting what I want. I can get away with it. Okay, then in fact, a lot of times people do get away with it in the sense of getting away from the police. Or even though everybody knows that Donald Trump is a crook, they still— he's getting away with it, right? Except that he's not. Because it's burning his mind. Putin thinks that he's going to be able to invade Ukraine and get away with it. Guess what? It's burning his mind. He really has a mental problem right now because he's not getting what he wanted and he's not getting away with it. And so there is the ordinary right view. Which is also a concept or a noun. And that concept, the word for it is, "No, you can't get away with it." No, you can't get away with it. We're going to make sure you can't get away with it. We're going to hire cops, we're going to get teachers, we're going to get an uncle or two, maybe a grandpa. And if the cops don't work, then we're going to get an army. And if the army doesn't work, we're going to get a priest, and we're going to make sure that you do not get away with it. Even if you die getting away with it, the priest and all of his minions and the Kamma machine are all going to work together to dig you up out of that grave just to kick your ass. And that's the way that they look at it. Okay, this is the ordinary right view. Is, is that we're going to make sure you don't get away with it. So you can see, in fact, in this regard, ordinary right view is your ordinary parent, and ordinary wrong view is the view of the child. And we carry these two components within our minds for the rest of our lives, with the rule maker saying, you can't get away with it, and the child saying, yes, I can get away with it. Whoops, I didn't get away with it that time, but next time I'll get away with And so these are both nouns in the sense of viewing, or a worldview, or a way that we see the world and things like this. But that's not what we mean by right view. Right view actually has the quality of right investigation, or right viewing, looking at what's happening right now. So One of them then would be the wrong view and the right view. Right, ordinary right view and wrong view would be like two books on the bookshelf. And right noble view is like a pair of binoculars. Okay. It's the looking, wisely looking at what's going on in the mind right now. To test for what's wholesome, what's not wholesome, what's useful, valuable, beneficial, what's going on right now. And things that are not happening right now, we don't have to think about right now. I don't have to think about what's going to happen tomorrow, or what happened last week, or what's even going to happen in an hour or two. Let's look at what's instead, what's actually happening right now. And if I'm thinking about what's going to happen tomorrow, it would be better if I stopped thinking about what's going to happen tomorrow and start thinking about what's happening right now. So thinking about tomorrow, thinking about last week, thinking about over there is unwholesome because it's not real. It's not here, not now. Right. And so we're going to start changing the thoughts that we have from thoughts of over there, back yonder, way over there in the future, all of that, and start looking at what's going on right now. This is one's right viewing. And if we look at what's happening right now, then we can have the change. We can make a change with the right effort for right now. Okay, so that changing from the unwholesome to the wholesome, if we go back and apply it now to Anapanasati, After we've been talking all of this time, we've only been talking about Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, the Four Noble Truths, and the Eightfold Noble Path. Now we're going to start to talk about how do we practice this. This is the Anapanasati practice. Now, the Anapanasati practice is a complete practice because it works with everything that you are or you think that you are. The body, the feelings, the mind, and the thoughts, and all the objects of the mind. This is the Satipatthana, or the four foundations of mindfulness. In other words, if we're going to be mindful, or Sati, if we're going to look at something, this is the group of things we're going to be looking at: the body, the feelings, the mind, and the mind's objects. Right here, right now. This is Anapanasati, is to take care of these four items. Well, taking care of the body, the first thing that we do is we work with the breathing. Then we work with the knowledge of the body. And eventually, very quickly, in fact, if we're practicing correctly, it's relaxation of the body to bring the body out of the state of tension, out of the state of pain, into a state of comfort and relaxation. We also do that with the mind by taking out the unwholesome thoughts and start paying attention to the body. By paying attention to the body, looking at what the body is doing, we've actually changed the mind. That in fact, we cannot even take a deep breath unless we change the mind to say the mind is going to tell the breath to be a big deep breath. If you don't think about it, it's not going to happen. The mind is the forerunner for everything. And so in order to train the body, we've got to train the mind at the same time. They work together like that. And so by paying attention to the body, we're going to be paying attention to the mind. And we're going to be paying attention to the body right here, right now, the way that the body is, not what we're going to do at the gym next week. Or unwrapping a bandage on the arm next month, or whatever that— like that. No, it's right here, right now. What's the body doing? And so we can work with it in the sense of that right here, right now, the environment that you're in, the body's in a room here that's safe and secure. So we need to work with the body to make sure that the body feels safe and secure as well as comfortable and satisfied. Well, sometimes we have to talk ourselves into that because we normally don't feel secure. We feel afraid. We think about that email that has to go to the boss, or think about the boss, or think about the cops, or think about this, that, and the other thing. We'll feel fear. But right here, right now, there's nothing to fear. And so we need to look at that to make sure that we understand that right now that there is nothing to fear. This is the nothingness that we can look at. There is nothing to fear. For instance, there are no alligators on the floor. I mean, look at the floor. Are there any alligators on the floor? How about a tarantula? Do you have a tarantula on your arm?

**Speaker B:** I wish. That'd be pretty cool.

**Speaker A:** Well, actually, you would be afraid.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I guess.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you'd be very careful, wouldn't you?

**Speaker B:** I'd be excited and afraid at the same time.

**Speaker A:** Right. All right. But the fact is, is that those things are not there, so there's no reason to be afraid. Or excited, that in fact both of those things for you right now are mental constructs. There is really no spider. And so when you think about the spider, you're thinking about that it would be exhilarating or interesting, but that's still a mental concept. A real spider is different. A real alligator in the room is different. If the SWAT team is breaking into your room right now, that's different than the thought of the SWAT team breaking into your room, the reality of it. But the reality is not happening. Since it's not happening, why should we have thoughts about it? Let's throw those out too. But we do it by saying there are No problems. There are no alligators, there's no tarantulas, there's no snakes, there's no boogeyman, there is no bear in the closet, and I can feel safe and secure right now. So this is the way that we start working with the language that we have. We start thinking in wholesome terms. In the Anapanasati Sutta, it's referred to as gladdening the mind, to brighten the mind, to gladden the mind, to put wholesome things in the mind. And the wholesome things would be: everything is good now, everything is safe, there's no problems, there's no worries, there's no flurries, there's no discomforts, and I can feel safe and secure. This safety, security, and comfort together will bring on satisfaction. In other words, the opposite of Dukkha, which is being dissatisfied, we can literally talk ourselves into the feeling of being satisfied. This word for the satisfaction, safety, security, and comfort, those items together have the Pali word Sukkha. And Sukkha is exactly the opposite of Dukkha. Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha is the same as saying Dukkha, Sukkha. Can you get yourself into a state of Sukkha? And then can you maintain that state of Sukkha? That's the point. This, in fact, this is part of Anapanasati, the actual training. Thus one trains oneself to breathe in long, to breathe out long, to have happy, satisfying thoughts. And then we begin to feel contented, satisfied, comfortable. This is the beginning of the practice. This is right view, right effort, and right Sati. We have to remember to do this, to take a look and to make a change, to come into this state of satisfaction by removing all the thoughts that are not satisfaction. If we do this over and over and over again, we begin to change our attitude. The attitude change here in the Pali is the Pali word Piti. Piti means elation. It means wow. It means celebration. It has to do with confidence. Okay, so imagine what happens when the star football player, let us say the World Cup or the Rose Bowl or the Sugar Bowl or the Heisman Trophy or whatever it is, and he's running down the field do with his football, and then he makes the touchdown. What's the thing that— what's the very first thing that he does after he makes the touchdown? Yes, he celebrates. Okay, that's what we're going to be practicing, is the practicing of the celebration of satisfaction. The celebration of satisfaction then is the Piti Sukkha. And they are both, in fact, steps. They call them steps. Item number 5 and item number 6 of Anapanasati is to put ourselves into this state of satisfaction, safety, security, comfort, and also that wow, this is good. The wow, I can do this. Wow, I'm still alive. Wow, this moment is really great. This state that we're talking about now, that has these unwholesome thoughts, these hindrances removed, they're gone. It also has the quality of applying the mind to the wholesome and keeping it there for a while to continue to have wholesome thoughts. And as we apply and sustain these wholesome thoughts, we begin to feel satisfied. And as we feel satisfied and we sustain that, we begin to feel like a champion. We can do this. These factors now are gathering together for a different kind of Samadhi. Before, we were talking about the integration and unification of the mind, and now we're talking about an integration and unification of features that exist only right now, and that is the feature of being completely free from the hindrances. Apply the mind to the wholesome, sustain the mind on the wholesome, allowing the Piti to arise and the Sukkha to arise. And guess what? You now have the 5 factors of the first Jhana, which is also accompanied by the relaxation of the body. So you could say that there are 6 factors of the Samadhi of the first Jhana, and that is when the mind is free from hindrances. We're thinking about only what's happening right now. When we enjoy what's happening right now, when we get a big kick out of what's happening right now because we're focusing on what's happening right now and we sustain that right now in a really comfortable way. Those are the 6 factors of the first Jhana. That's another kind of Samadhi. And when you're in that state of Samadhi, where's the Dukkha? No Dukkha. So this is the practice of Anapanasati, and this is the practice that we're getting together. And when we have these 5 items together, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa calls that A mind fit for work. The Buddha talks about it in a sense of unification of the mind. So the question is, when the mind is fit for work, what work is there to do? The answer to that is what we have already been doing, in the sense of looking at what's going on, except now we're doing it with a mind that's really fit for doing it. That we don't have to keep coming back from the unwholesome thoughts because we've got one wholesome thought after another. So now we're going to be looking at the application of the mind, focusing the mind, sustaining the mind, focusing on, in fact, seeing that we are free from hindrances. Also that we can experience the Piti and the Sukkha. So let's look at that. Let's really, really feel good by paying all of our attention to how we feel, because our thoughts are no longer important because they're already all wholesome. So we can begin to let gaps happen in the thoughts, and we pay all of our attention on— or our thought moments now are all about how good we feel. So that's what we're going to be doing with the mind that's fit for work, is we're going to really experience what's going on in a very wholesome way. So this is Anapanasati, a beginning of Anapanasati, and you can see how deeply tied it is to the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path and the Satipatthana. They're all intricately related. And when you see them as a unification or intricately related, you can recognize that the teaching of the Buddha is actually not big. A lot of people get the idea that Buddhism is vast. No, it's not. It's just the same thing over and over and over again. It's one thing 10 million times, it's not 10 million things. So we practice it over and over and over and over and over again because the old habits will pull us back into the past.

**Speaker B:** I feel like what you're talking about is like with Jhana, that's a conditioned state though.

**Speaker A:** Yes, but it's a hell of a lot better conditioned state than the state you're in right now. Here you are going around pulling things apart, picking at it. I mean, that's what you normally do. It doesn't matter how good it is, you can find something wrong with it. There you are, back to Adam and Eve again, destroying your paradise. I give you a paradise, you say, yeah, but it's conditioned.

**Speaker B:** I feel like for myself, I don't know if I have that many, like, overt unwholesome thoughts nowadays.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's just because you're not skilled at detecting what a thought is, whether it's wholesome or not. This is the new practice. Is to begin to look at and make a determination. Are these thoughts really as wholesome as I thought that they were? This is the deception. This is the denial. This is the delusion that we're in. And we can call it ignorance, but it's not necessarily ignorance, because ignorance, especially wise ignorance— when you don't know something, you know you don't know it. But here you are saying, well, my thoughts are not all that unwholesome, which means that you don't know, you haven't seen. And as you develop the skill of knowing what's a wholesome thought and what's not a wholesome thought, then you'll be able to make better choices. One thing for sure, and that is, is that we do know that there are some thoughts that are absolutely unwholesome— thoughts of cruelty, thoughts of getting something, thoughts of hurting someone, either to get something or to get revenge. So thoughts of other people suffering is truly unwholesome cruelty. Then there is a whole wide variety of thoughts that are, let us say, have value for us or have some sort of gratification. And we don't see the danger. But once we begin to investigate, we can begin to see the dangers in these things that we used to get gratification from. And now that we see the danger, we have to make kind of a balance here. Is it really worth the effort? To go get what I want. And when we recognize that maybe it's not worth the effort, maybe I can put that thought down and just be happy instead. So we begin to work from the position of some things are automatically unwholesome. There's a huge gray area, but there's also that point that we know of where things are absolutely wholesome. An example of that, which we've already had, is this present moment. Everything is okay, everything is fine, no worries, no flurries, no problems, nowhere to go, nothing to do. And the spring comes and the grass grows by itself. Other thoughts like, I don't need anything, I've already got everything I need. Wow, what a nice moment. This is. Now, those thoughts are wholesome. So those are the kind of hearts that you can begin to work with, as opposed to the other kind of thoughts which are about over there, back then, someplace else. And start bringing your thoughts to right here, right now. The body is doing this right now. The hands are doing this right now. The breathing is operating like this right now. I feel like this right now. I think these thoughts right now. So that's what it's all about. In fact, you probably have heard that the Buddha was referred to in his time as the Tathagata. He didn't— wasn't called Buddha. I don't even know when it was that the word Buddha became popular, but it was hundreds and hundreds of years afterwards. That we do know that 150 years after the time of the Buddha, that the pillars, the edicts, the stuff that was carved by King Ashoka or Emperor Ashoka called him Sakyamuni. So where the word Buddha came from, I'm not sure, but he called himself Tathagata. Do you know what that word means?

**Speaker B:** Is it like, thus come, thus gone?

**Speaker A:** Well, that is one of the really, really bad translations. And what it means, the word tathagata actually means here, the here now, thusness, thisness. This is it, this right Now, whoops, it's gone, but there's a new one right now. Whoops, it's gone too, but there's a new moment. This is what we mean by this present moment, this, as opposed to something that happened 10 seconds ago. So the word Tathagata means the one who is in the present moment. Thus Gone One means the one who has gone to thisness or thusness.

**Speaker B:** Interesting.

**Speaker A:** But how couldn't you get that out of the translation that you did get? No.

**Speaker B:** Wow, that's very interesting.

**Speaker A:** So you too can be Tathagata. You too can be right here, right now. By waking up and paying attention to what's going on right here, right now, and making the change. The change is to change it from what you thought it was into what it actually is. Yeah, come out of our ideas and concepts into the reality of the moment.

**Speaker B:** Coming out of our imagination.

**Speaker A:** Right, precisely. And coming into investigation. Coming out of the books and picking up the telescope or the binoculars and look. Sometimes people ask me what books should they read, and the answer to that is read the book between your ears.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's great.

**Speaker A:** All right, so one last point, and that is that you said that you probably practiced about 15 minutes. I would recommend that 15 minutes is a good time, but it's not often enough. Not once a day. We need to practice 3, 4, 5, 6 times a day for 15 minutes, because what's 15 minutes going to do you when you've got the other 23 hours and 45 minutes of old hindrances? It's better to practice often. To sit down intentionally, to sit down and to say, right now I'm going to be here. Now, right now I'm going to think about what is right in front of me— this, the body, the feelings, what's in the mind— and to start making some changes. So this is the practice that I would recommend. 4, 5, 6 times a day for 15 minutes. 10 or 15 minutes is good. In Western Buddhism, they think that, oh, you got to sit for an hour. But normally people get really tired after about 30 minutes, especially if they're not used to the postures and their mind has lost its focus and attention. And so they start their meditation with the idea of, oh, I've got time. And now after 10 or 20 minutes, now the mind is really tired and they still don't practice. So when you're taking 15 minutes to practice, make sure that that first breath is a practice right from the get-go to take that deep breath and say everything is okay right now, everything is fine, no worries, no problems, I don't have to think about that. And then when thoughts do come We can say, aha, I see you, Mara. Aha, I see that thought. Then we can just throw it out and come back to the present moment. Ah, but I don't have to think about that now. Isn't it nice? I don't have to think about any of those problems. I can just sit here for the next 5 or 10 minutes and just enjoy relaxing.

**Speaker B:** I feel like there's always going to be hindrances though, like you can't throw— always?

**Speaker A:** What kind of word is an always word?

**Speaker B:** As long as the body is alive.

**Speaker A:** Well, let us put it this way: always means you're not looking, because if you are looking and you throw that hindrance out, then there— then right now always doesn't exist. You can make a change. Not only that, but you do have wholesome thoughts on a regular basis. If you had one unwholesome thought after another after another with no wholesome thoughts in there anywhere, you'd already be dead. Either the body would cave in on itself or you'd have hurt it somehow. But bodies don't last if you are totally 100% negative all the time.

**Speaker B:** I mean, I think some people manage it.

**Speaker A:** Not for long. Not even corporate executives. No, they have to have some kind of hope, some They're just looking for love in all the wrong places. But they do relax. If a guy doesn't relax ever and is uptight all the time, he's going to give himself a heart attack. So you do have wholesome thoughts. Begin to look at the wholesome thoughts that you do have. Sometimes you're going to wake up and look at the thought that you're having. You're saying, hey, that was already a wholesome thought. Thought. And now you can go directly into the yippee-ki-yay, I'm already having wholesome thoughts. I don't even have to take the effort.

**Speaker B:** I still have a hard time getting into Jhana though.

**Speaker A:** Well, having trouble getting into Jhana is the way you've been practicing. We're not trying to practice getting into Jhana. You're not practicing getting anything. Getting into Jhana, you can't do it. Of course it's hard. Stop trying to get something and just relax and be satisfied with what you've already got.

**Speaker B:** That's good. That's good advice.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, that's the advice of the Buddha. Yeah, if you understand the Jhana factors then you have to understand how to practice those with the Eightfold Noble Path so that you could talk yourself into being satisfied. You don't get Jhana and then become satisfied because you've got Jhana. That's ridiculous. You have to have the satisfaction and the wow experience, and then you can label that as 1 John. Well, David, I think that we've gotten a good place to rest today. I would recommend that you go practice for a few days and then call me back.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I'll take what you said to heart. Thank you so much for your time and all your words of advice. It was great to talk to you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** All right, enjoy the moment.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, thank you.

**Speaker A:** Some people would say have a good day. I don't have anything to do with the rest of the day. I don't know what that's like, but for right now Have a good moment.

**Speaker B:** Have a good moment. It's the only moment.

**Speaker A:** This is all we've got.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** See you.

**Speaker B:** Take care.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points and teachings presented by Dhammarato (Speaker A) to David (Speaker B):

### **Core Theme: Correcting Misunderstandings & The Actual Practice**
Dhammarato begins by critiquing "Western Buddhism," arguing that key Pali terms (like *dukkha*, *samadhi*, *anatta*) have been incorrectly translated and Christianized, leading to a distorted practice focused on struggle and goal-oriented attainment.

### **Main Teachings:**

1.  **Dukkha is Not "Suffering":**
    *   **Correct Meaning:** *Dukkha* means "inherently unsatisfying" or "unsatisfactory." It's a **judgment we make** when we are dissatisfied with how things are.
    *   **Key Analogy:** Like Adam and Eve judging things in paradise as "good" or "evil," we create our own dissatisfaction by labeling and wanting things to be different.
    *   **The Practice:** *Dukkha nirodha* means ending that dissatisfaction **right now**. It's not a distant goal but an immediate mental shift.

2.  **The Four Noble Truths - Clarified:**
    *   **1st Truth (Dukkha):** Life itself is **not** *dukkha*. Life is a gift. *Dukkha* is our added layer of dissatisfaction with it.
    *   **2nd Truth (Cause):** The cause is **ignorance/stupidity**—not paying attention to the present moment. We are like a farmer so focused on distant cows that he steps in cow pies. We are ignorant of our own greed and ill-will.
    *   **3rd Truth (Cessation):** Freedom from *dukkha* is available **several times a day** (e.g., moments of satisfaction after a meal). It's not a rare, monumental event.
    *   **4th Truth (Path):** Leads into the Eightfold Path.

3.  **The Eightfold Path as Unification of Mind (Samadhi):**
    *   **Samadhi is wrongly translated as "concentration."** Correctly, it means **unification or integration** of the mind—bringing all its conflicting parts (the inner rule-maker and the rebellious child) into harmony, free from internal conflict.
    *   **Core Practice Loop:** He emphasizes three factors working together:
        *   **Right View (Sammā-diṭṭhi):** Skillfully investigating what's happening in the mind **right now**.
        *   **Right Mindfulness (Sammā-sati):** **Remembering** to come back to the present moment, again and again.
        *   **Right Effort (Sammā-vāyāma):** Making the effort to **change** unwholesome thoughts to wholesome ones.
    *   **Right Intention/Attitude (Sammā-saṅkappa):** This is the "leaning" of the mind. The practice aims to shift our attitude from being a **victim** (a default childhood state) to being a **"winner" or "lion"**—confident that we can handle anything, even death.

4.  **Anapanasati (Mindfulness of Breathing) as the Practical Method:**
    *   It's the complete practice for working with the four foundations of mindfulness: body, feelings, mind, and mind objects.
    *   **The Goal is Sukkha (Satisfaction):** The direct opposite of *dukkha*. The practice is to actively "talk ourselves" into a state of **safety, security, comfort, and satisfaction** *right now*.
    *   **Steps to Jhana:** By removing unwholesome thoughts (about past/future/elsewhere) and sustaining wholesome thoughts (about present-moment safety and satisfaction), the factors for the **first jhana** naturally arise:
        *   Freedom from hindrances.
        *   Applied & sustained thought on the wholesome.
        *   **Pīti** (elation/celebration/"wow").
        *   **Sukkha** (happiness/satisfaction).
        *   This unified, joyful, satisfied state is a "mind fit for work."

5.  **Crucial Attitudinal Shifts:**
    *   **Stop Wanting Attainment:** The difficulty in reaching jhana comes from **wanting it**. The instruction is to **stop trying to get something** and instead relax into the satisfaction already available.
    *   **Practice Frequently, Not Long:** Recommend 15-minute sessions, **4-6 times a day**. Short, frequent practice is more effective than one long, tiring session where the mind wanders.
    *   **Thought Investigation:** Most thoughts are unwholesome because they are **conceptual** (about past, future, people not present). Wholesome thoughts are about **"right here, right now."** We must develop the skill to detect the difference.
    *   **The Present Moment is "Tathāgata":** This term means "thusness" or "here-now-ness." The goal is to be the "one who is in the present moment."

### **Conclusion & Advice for David:**
Dhammarato concludes by advising David to:
*   Let go of the struggle to "get" jhana.
*   Practice the method of cultivating immediate satisfaction (*sukkha*) through present-moment awareness.
*   Practice in short, frequent sessions.
*   Investigate his thoughts to see if they are truly wholesome (present-focused) or unwholesome (conceptual).

The talk's essence is a call to simplify practice: drop Westernized, goal-oriented striving, correct key definitions, and directly cultivate a satisfied, unified mind in the present moment through mindful awareness and attitude adjustment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key metaphors and stories used by Speaker A (Dhammarato) to explain Buddhist concepts:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The Cow Pie / Goal-Oriented Farmer:** This is the central metaphor for misunderstanding *dukkha* and wrong practice.
    *   **Scenario:** A farmer wants to get to his cows on the other side of a pasture. He focuses only on the goal (the cows) and not on where he is stepping.
    *   **Meaning:** If you are goal-oriented (focused on future attainments like enlightenment or Jhana), you will not pay attention to the present moment. As a result, you will step in "cow pies" (suffering, dissatisfaction) because you are ignorant of your current steps. True practice is watching each step (each present moment) to avoid *dukkha*.

2.  **Life Sucks / We Do the Sucking:** A playful, modern metaphor for the Second Noble Truth.
    *   **Scenario:** "If you keep sucking on stuff, then your life sucks. When you stop sucking, your life don't suck no more."
    *   **Meaning:** Dissatisfaction (*dukkha*) is not inherent in life itself. It is created by our own mental attitude of craving and clinging ("sucking" on experiences, desires). The cause is within us.

3.  **The Leaning Tree (for *Sankappa* / Intention):**
    *   **Scenario:** A woodcutter knows a tree will fall in the direction it leans.
    *   **Meaning:** Our mind has a "leaning" or habitual attitude (e.g., victim, loser, struggler). That direction determines where we "fall" or how we experience life. Practice involves changing that fundamental leaning/attitude.

4.  **From Victim to Lion:** A metaphor for the transformation of attitude.
    *   **Scenario:** We start life as helpless, dependent victims (like infants). Through practice, we can develop the attitude of a "lion"—confident, capable, and fearless, able to handle anything, even death.

5.  **Right View as Binoculars vs. Books:**
    *   **Scenario:** Wrong View and ordinary Right View are like static "books on a shelf" (fixed worldviews, like "I can get away with it" vs. "You can't get away with it").
    *   **Meaning:** **Right Noble View** is not a fixed noun but an active verb. It is like using "a pair of binoculars" to investigate and see clearly what is happening in the mind *right now*.

6.  **The Mind is a Crowd / Needs Unification:** A metaphor for *samadhi*.
    *   **Scenario:** An ordinary, conflicted mind is like a disintegrated "crowd" or "mess" with internal arguments (e.g., one part wants to diet, another doesn't).
    *   **Meaning:** *Samadhi* is not forceful concentration (keeping one part, throwing another out). It is the "unification" or integration of all parts of the mind into a harmonious, conflict-free whole.

7.  **The Football Touchdown Celebration (for *Piti*):**
    *   **Scenario:** What does a football player do immediately after scoring a touchdown? He celebrates.
    *   **Meaning:** *Piti* (often translated as "rapture" or "joy") is the "celebration of satisfaction." It's the "wow!" or elation that arises when we successfully arrive in a state of satisfaction (*sukkha*) in the present moment.

### **Stories & Analogies**

1.  **Adam and Eve in Genesis:** Used to explain *dukkha*.
    *   **Story:** Adam and Eve were in paradise until they ate the "fruit of the knowledge of good and evil."
    *   **Interpretation:** Eating the fruit represents adopting a "judgmental mind." Paradise is destroyed not by an external force, but by labeling things within it as good or bad, desirable or undesirable. This is the essence of *dukkha*—creating dissatisfaction through our judgments about experience.

2.  **Christian vs. Buddhist Monks:** A cultural story to illustrate mistranslation and misunderstanding.
    *   **Story:** At Wat Greensboro, visitors also went to a nearby Christian monastery and didn't understand the differences.
    *   **Details:** Christian monks live by a strict, clock-driven schedule of prayers and work. Buddhist monks (in this telling) have only one fixed time (lunch) and emphasize freedom, lack of heaviness, and "nothing to do."
    *   **Purpose:** To show how Western (Christian) frameworks have incorrectly shaped the understanding of Buddhist terms and practices.

3.  **The Choking Choice:** A blunt analogy to refute the idea "life is suffering."
    *   **Scenario:** "If I had you by the throat... would you choose to die now or in 5 minutes?"
    *   **Point:** The instinct to choose more life proves that life itself is not *dukkha*. The problem is our *clinging* to life and our dissatisfaction within it.

4.  **Conditional Love in Childhood:** A psychological story for the origin of dissatisfaction.
    *   **Story:** A baby receives unconditional love, but by age 2-4, a child's world becomes based on conditions ("Mommy's little helper," school, rewards for good behavior).
    *   **Meaning:** We are trained from childhood to believe we are "not okay" as we are and that acceptance/love/satisfaction must be earned. This sets the pattern of constantly wanting something else to feel complete.

5.  **Contemporary Figures (Trump, Putin):** Used as examples of "wrong view."
    *   **Example:** Figures like Donald Trump or Vladimir Putin operate on the "wrong view" that they can act with greed and ill-will and "get away with it."
    *   **Point:** The speaker argues they *cannot* get away with it because their actions are "burning [their] mind," causing internal suffering (*dukkha*) regardless of external consequences.

6.  **The SWAT Team & The Boogeyman:** Used to differentiate conceptual fear from present reality.
    *   **Scenario:** The speaker asks if there are alligators, tarantulas, or a SWAT team in the room *right now*.
    *   **Point:** Most of our fears and anxieties are "mental constructs" about things that are **not** happening in our present sensory reality. Letting go of these concepts is part of creating *sukkha* (satisfaction, safety) in the now.

**Overall Purpose:** These metaphors and stories are used to demystify core Buddhist teachings (*dukkha*, the Noble Truths, the Eightfold Path, *samadhi*, *jhana*), strip away what the speaker sees as Western/Christian misinterpretations, and reframe the practice as an immediate, accessible, and non-striving process of changing one's attitude in the present moment.
