### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So you're saying that while you're practicing Anapanasati, you're noticing tensions in the body? Where?

**Speaker B:** There's a lot in like my torso region, so like the chest or like below the chest. But occasionally there's like— it happens in other parts of the body too.

**Speaker A:** Say again, where?

**Speaker B:** Sorry, like in the chest area, like, or below the chest?

**Speaker A:** Sure.

**Speaker B:** And then sometimes in— that's just the.

**Speaker A:** Legs, but not everybody feels it. Okay, so the next question: is this old or new tension?

**Speaker B:** Um, I don't know, probably old.

**Speaker A:** You can probably take my word for it that this is old stuff, but you're now beginning to see it. Also, it's used in conjunction with the word anxiety. Would you say that in fact the tensions of the chest could be seen as anxiety?

**Speaker B:** Yes, but then I feel like there's a slight difference, or— well, I'm not sure exactly what it is.

**Speaker A:** Well, let's look at the similarities, not the differences. Okay, okay. The next thing is that, um, this chest tension, um, which is now being seen, actually has been affecting your behavior before, but you were not aware of it. Is that possible?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay. That in fact, um, we're often driven, uh, to do things in order to get rid of that tension and anxiety without even recognizing that that's what motivates us. Okay, so if you're now beginning to see that tension and anxiety in your chest Isn't that a good thing?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, now we're going someplace. Yeah, so you can begin to congratulate yourself for being able to see stuff that you couldn't see before. But that's in fact one of the aspects of Anapanasati, is that as you're breathing in long and breathing out long, you begin to see what's happening in the body. This is in fact, if you go by the numbers, this is item number 3 on the list of Anapanasati, is to experience the body. And you're experiencing the body, you're getting to see the body, beginning to notice the body. So this is all in line with the practice. Now the next thing in that list of items to practice would be to relax the body. Samadhi. So how do you think that you can relax this tension now that you've found it? Is hating it and wishing it to go away— is that going to help relax?

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker A:** Ah, but being happy that you've seen it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yes, to be happy that you've seen it, and now we can do something about it. And one of the things that we can do about it is to breathe in long and watch it while you're breathing in long, and then in fact you can begin to play a game with it in the sense of as you breathe in long, will that tension or anxiety make any changes or movements? For instance, as you breathe in, does it expand, and as you breathe out, it contracts? Can you move it up or further in the chest using your breathing? Can you move it further down in your chest as you're breathing? And in fact, if you can begin to control it, then you can begin to actually breathe it out. As I breathe out, I breathe out that tension. Now there's something else going on, and that something else is that the tension normally comes after we've had tense thoughts. We have body tensions and therefore tense feelings. So what you can begin to watch for is what kind of thoughts bring up that tension and anxiety. Thoughts of work, thoughts of things that you have to do— those are the kinds of thoughts that bring up the tension that people have. So they think about something, then they have the tension, and now they feel driven to go do something about it. To where in fact all we really need to do is just to relax. Just relax. That's all we need to do is just relax. And you can relax that tension. Wow, I'm really glad I saw that. Really glad I can see that stuff, recognizing that my thoughts create it. So now I can look more closely at the thoughts that create such tensions. It's a fairly easy process, nothing much to it.

**Speaker B:** Got it.

**Speaker A:** So you think you can do that?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. So why don't we go ahead and finish the call now, and you go practice that and call me back, and let's hear the results of your practice. Call me in a few days.

**Speaker B:** I will. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Okay. All right, well, we'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A), is a practical coaching session on applying **Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing)** to work with bodily tension and anxiety.

Here is a summary of the key points:

**1.  Discovery:** The practitioner (Speaker B) reports noticing tension, primarily in the chest/torso area, during meditation. Dhammarato guides them to recognize this as **old, accumulated tension** that is now becoming visible through mindfulness.

**2.  Connection:** Dhammarato links this physical tension directly to **anxiety** and explains that such unconscious tension has likely been driving behavior (e.g., doing things to relieve the unease) without the practitioner's awareness. **Seeing it is framed as progress and a cause for happiness.**

**3.  Framework of the Practice:** This discovery is placed within the formal structure of Anapanasati:
*   **Step 3 (Experiencing the Body):** Noticing the tension is part of "experiencing the body."
*   **Next Step (Calming the Body):** The natural next step is to **relax** or pacify (*samadhi*) what has been found.

**4.  Practical Method:** Instead of resisting or hating the tension, the instructed method is:
*   **Be happy you see it.**
*   **Use the breath to investigate and play with it:** Observe if it changes with the in-breath and out-breath. Try to gently "move" it with the breath, or imagine breathing the tension out.
*   **Trace it to its source:** Understand that tension follows **tense thoughts** (e.g., about work, obligations). The sequence is: Thought → Bodily Tension/Anxiety → Driven Behavior.

**5.  Core Insight & Instruction:** The fundamental solution is to **simply relax**. By seeing the tension and understanding its origin in thought, one can interrupt the cycle. The practice is to relax the body *and* to look more closely at the thoughts that create the tension.

**6.  Outcome:** The session ends with an assignment: to practice this specific technique of mindful breathing to investigate and relax the found tension, and to report back on the results.

**In essence,** the talk teaches that noticing tension in meditation is not a problem but a success of mindfulness. It provides a clear, non-judgmental strategy: use the breath to engage with and soften the physical sensation, while developing insight into the mental patterns that cause it, ultimately leading to relaxation and calm.

### Metaphors and Stories

Excellent question. The speaker uses several key metaphors and a subtle but powerful story framework to guide the listener's understanding. Here’s a breakdown:

### Metaphors

1.  **The Unseen Driver:** The tension/anxiety is described as something that has been **affecting your behavior before, but you were not aware of it**. The metaphor is that we are often **driven** by these unconscious tensions to act (e.g., to do things to get rid of the feeling). Becoming aware of it is like finally seeing the driver who has been controlling the car.

2.  **The Game:** The practice of working with the tension is framed as a **game**. The speaker suggests: *"you can begin to play a game with it... Can you move it up or further in the chest using your breathing?"* This metaphor reduces resistance and fear, turning investigation into a curious, playful, and experimental activity rather than a grim battle.

3.  **Breathing It Out:** The tension is treated as a **substance** that can be expelled. *"You can begin to actually breathe it out. As I breathe out, I breathe out that tension."* This gives the practitioner a direct, somatic technique that feels active and empowering.

4.  **The Chain of Causation (The Factory):** A clear cause-and-effect metaphor is used: **thoughts → tension/feelings → driven behavior**. The body tension is the physical product of the "thought factory." Seeing this chain allows you to intervene at the source (the thoughts) rather than just dealing with the product (the tension and compulsive actions).

### Story Framework

The entire dialogue follows a classic **"Hero's Journey" or "Discovery Narrative"** for the practitioner (Speaker B):

*   **The Call to Adventure/Discovery:** The initial noticing of tension during meditation is the call. It's something new coming into awareness.
*   **Reframing the Problem as a Gift:** The guide (Speaker A) reframes the tension not as a failure or obstacle, but as a **success of the practice** ("*Isn't that a good thing?*", "*you can begin to congratulate yourself*"). This is a crucial plot twist—the monster is actually a treasure map.
*   **The Road of Trials (The Practice):** The hero is given tools and tasks: 1) Be happy you saw it, 2) Play the "game" of exploring it with the breath, 3) Trace it back to its source (the thoughts).
*   **The Ultimate Boon (Insight & Agency):** The promised reward is not necessarily the immediate disappearance of tension, but **understanding and control**. The key insight is: *"my thoughts create it... So now I can look more closely at the thoughts."* This grants the practitioner agency.
*   **The Return with the Elixir:** The call is ended with an assignment to go **practice and return with results**. The story is left open-ended, with the expectation that the listener will return having integrated this new skill and understanding, completing their mini-quest.

### Overall Narrative Metaphor

The talk itself is a **guided excavation or uncovering**. The tension is an **old, buried artifact** of past patterns ("*probably old stuff, but you're now beginning to see it*"). The practice of Ānāpānasati (mindfulness of breathing) is the tool that gently brushes away the dirt, allowing the practitioner to see, understand, and finally **relax** the holding pattern that has been there all along.

In summary, the speaker uses metaphors of **unseen drivers, playful games, and expulsion** to make the process approachable. They frame the experience within a **story of successful discovery and empowerment**, transforming a moment of difficulty in meditation into a pivotal step forward on the path.
