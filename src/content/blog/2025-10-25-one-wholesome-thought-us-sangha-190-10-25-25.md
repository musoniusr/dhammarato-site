### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So welcome, friends. It's Saturday morning, August 25th— or October 25th— and today we're going to have a lot of fun. We're going to be talking about pleasure. Karuna has asked a question about pleasure, and so we'll talk about that now. First off, we'll talk about it in the sense that there are two kinds of pleasures. There is low-class pleasure and then there is high-class pleasure. Now, what do we mean by low-class and high-class is that the pleasures that we normally associate with the word pleasure and pleasantness comes from our contact with the senses, most especially getting something that we want. An example of that would be delicious food, or maybe a movie that we like, and whatnot like that. Now, one of the issues about it is that the more effort that we put in, the more pleasure we get out of it. For instance, you can have lasagna at home And the lasagna tastes exactly taste-wise of the lasagna that you have at a fancy Italian restaurant. But getting dressed and going to the restaurant and sitting down and all of that kind of stuff with waiters and whatnot like that, and you think, oh, this is so pleasurable and this lasagna is so good. But didn't you actually add a bunch of stuff with that mentally? That it's not just the lasagna, it's the setup that we go through. And another example that I'll use is that mommies and women who cook, they gain pleasure by people gaining pleasure from eating their food. Even waiters do that, and they didn't even cook the food. How did you enjoy your meal? And if you tell them, I didn't enjoy the meal. It was just ordinary. It's lasagna, you know. And then he's not going to get any pleasure out of that statement. But if you compliment him and say, oh, the lasagna was very good, then he'll gain pleasure. So we gain and give each other pleasure based upon taste buds, eyeballs, ears, and all kinds of things like that that the Buddha would call sensual pleasure because it comes from our senses, and that when we want pleasure, we call that sensual desire. The other kind of pleasure is the pleasure of not wanting anything. In fact, the Bhikkhu Buddhadasa wrote a book— it was actually a talk that he gave one time, just been turned into book form And the name of the book is Happiness and Hunger, where he points out that our hunger is fulfilled and we gain happiness by fulfilling our hunger, whether that's hunger for food, hunger for entertainment, hunger for sounds. An example then with sounds would be music. And if you go out to a concert, if you'll actually see concerts, people get a whole lot more pleasure and joy jumping around and singing with the musicians and all that kind of stuff, they get a whole lot more pleasure than if they just put on the recording. There's not much pleasure because there's nothing to it. And so we see then that we are pleasure-seeking animals. We want to have pleasure. But guess what? So are cats. They just gain pleasure by having their back scratched, or they gain pleasure by chasing a laser. But all animals seek pleasure. And that the pleasure that the Buddha talks about is non-sensual. It's like in the book with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, he talks about the hunger that gives us pleasure as a sensual kind, but we can gain happiness without— in fact, he talks about it in the sense that the real happiness comes from not wanting anything. And so sensual pleasure is always a two-step process: I want something, I get it, I feel happy. And the other one is a one-step process: I don't want anything, isn't that marvelous? And so there was a Greek named Epicurus that Karwan mentioned. And I would like to point out that due to the history, we know that in the time of the Buddha, there were actually Greeks who were Bhikkhus in the time of the Buddha. How did that happen? Well, it happened because there was a lot of migration in those times, and that there was a colony of Greeks that had been, let us say, gathered up and put in a particular place that was on the Indus River in probably Pakistan, where it currently is now. And so because we know, in fact, they even know two of them by name, though I've forgotten what they were. But Greeks then were knowledgeable of the Dharma in the time of the Buddha. It's quite possible, or even likely, that the teaching of the Buddha spread back to Greece. That in fact, Herodotus, his teachings— he was actually an Uh, he lived at the same time as the Buddha, and yet his teachings are very, very much like Buddha. Also, there was a group in Alexandria that, uh, uh, went by the name of Theraputta. Now, the word putta is, is, uh, one of the words that we have, uh, for talking, as well as vada. So we have the Theravada, which is the words of the elders. But when it got to Alexandria, it became the Therapeute. Now guess what? Where do you think we get the word therapy from today? So there was Buddhist monks. Maybe they didn't wear the same clothes or have the exact same habits, But Jesus as an infant was in Alexandria, so there was possibly a connection to where the teachings of the Buddha actually got around the European and, well, more the Mediterranean area. And so this is also Epicurus who did some writing. I think he was from like the 3rd century BC. And it's remarkable how close Epicurus' teaching is to that of the Buddha, where he's talking about pleasure in the same way. And so how can we now start to practice gaining that pleasure? Well, we have been talking about that every time, and I always mention it. About that we have to begin to change our thoughts because the normal thoughts that we have are thoughts of wanting, thoughts of getting ordinary pleasures, and that we can change those thoughts into the higher kind of thought. We call them unwholesome thoughts of wanting something whether we get it or not, but if we want something and we get it, we get pleasure. And if we want something and we don't get it, that's what we call dissatisfaction. And that's what the real teachings of the Buddha is, is that we can in fact find a way of living our lives moment by moment without having that dissatisfaction that comes from wanting something that we don't have right now. And how we can do that is by starting to practice having thoughts that are what we call wholesome thoughts. So unwholesome thoughts are the thoughts of wanting things, wanting to get rid of things, even thoughts of cruelty. I mean, let's take a poll, a quick poll. How many of us here have had thoughts of having cruelty for some politician like Putin or Trump? We've all had those thoughts of cruelty. Yeah, we'd like to see them harmed. We'd like to see them out of office. We'd like to see them hurt. We'd like to see them getting some payback from the pain that they've caused other people. But don't you realize that you're giving yourself that pain, not Trump? By hating Trump, you're not harming Trump at all, but you're harming yourself. Because you're now wanting something that you can't have. You want to harm him and you can't do it. So it's better not to have those kind of thoughts. Maybe it's better to say, huh, may Trump be happy. In fact, if he was a happy man, he wouldn't be so dangerous. The reason that he is so dangerous is because he wants things he can't have. And so maybe we can have the wish that maybe he's okay, everything is all right. May his hunger be filled, or better still, may he be free from hunger. And may I be also free from that hunger so that I don't have to have those unwholesome thoughts of cruelty and wanting something that I don't have. So this must be practiced. Now, several weeks ago I gave a, um, uh, let us say a technique of turning the cell phone on with a timer so that once an hour or so the telephone, uh, alarm will go off, and that would be a time then to stop what you're doing, put things down and practice having wholesome thoughts one after another for 5 minutes. Well, one of the students here was, let us say, authentic enough to tell the truth, to say that when my alarm goes off, I have unhappy thoughts. Oh, I don't want to practice Dharma right now. How many of you have done that? How many of you, in fact, have actually put a timer on your cell phone? Has anybody done that? Well, I invite you to do it.

**Speaker B:** I did it for a couple of hours, but yeah, it was great.

**Speaker A:** All right, but what happens over time is, is that you go back to the ordinary mind state and say, oh, I don't want to practice right now. And so why? Because I'm too busy wanting to get something that I don't have, and I'll get more pleasure by getting what I don't have than I will be by just having pleasure without having a cause for it. So what I would recommend then is instead of taking 5 minutes, because that's a terribly long time when you don't want to do it, and just have one wholesome thought. So when that alarm goes off, have one wholesome thought. Wow, I'm glad that alarm goes off. Now I can take a deep breath and just relax. Now I'm back at it again. Okay, so I wouldn't recommend this unless it's the better of the two, uh, possibilities. That if you can in fact do that with that phone so that every time that it goes off, you have one wholesome thought and get the benefit of that one wholesome thought. Maybe next time when the phone goes off, you'll have two wholesome thoughts in a row, and then maybe a third, so that you begin to build up to that 5 minutes and then on from there. But this is the way that we get started and that notice that we have reluctance to doing that because of our desire, and we don't recognize that we can be far happier by not getting what we want because we don't want anything. So start practicing being in that state of 'I don't want anything, isn't that marvelous? I have no hunger.' Isn't that great? I can have the happiness that goes with no hunger at all. So there's another way that I wanted to— is Ivan? Yes, Ivan had a question about Samskara, and that I want to bring that in too, that basically we can say that there are two kinds of Samskara. The Samskara of the memory of the past, and then the Samskaras that you're creating right here, right now. And so if you have all of these Samskaras from the past of I get pleasure by getting my way, then you will reinforce that in the present moment of I'll get my way I'll feel good, and if I don't get my way, I'll feel bad, rather than if I don't get my way, then I don't need a way. If I don't have a way, I could be happy without a way. I don't have to get my way. And so this is how we begin to practice, but we have to practice it often because we've got a whole pile of stuff from the past of getting what we want and getting our pleasure from that. So if we can— I've had an old story about this. Imagine that all of these Samskaras are a sewer, and that if we can put happy thoughts into the mind, that's like putting a whole load of hamburgers on top of the sewer. So that they're piled up high, so that you don't reach down into the sewage anymore. You've got a whole new layer of happy thoughts on top. Well, if you have one happy thought per hour, that's still not going to change the sewer much. You're going to need a whole lot of happy thoughts to, let us say, layer over all of the old unhappy thoughts that you've had. But correct practice— the Buddha's teachings are good in the beginning if you're practicing in the beginning, practicing having wholesome happy thoughts. And you can be happy right now until you stop, until you forget, and then go have some unhappy thoughts, thoughts of getting something that you want. So the point that we're making here is, is that if we start piling up happy thoughts, that's also kind of organizing things. So another analogy would be imagine that the normal human mind is like a big library, a city library, or maybe a university library. Where they keep the books, except all the books are piled up on top in a great big pile. Two-thirds of them are open to something or another, but they're just all in a great big pile. Well, that's how our memories are. They're just piled in there, no organization there at all. So what we're going to start doing is, is that instead of figuring out what's going on, when new thoughts come in the new present moment, we can begin to organize those thoughts. And pretty soon we can start cleaning up that library, put the books back on the shelf so that we can gain some space in the mind. So these are two analogies that we have for the Samskara, is that they're all piled together. There's no distinguishment, which means that more than likely the next thought that you're going to have is random. Don't know where it's going to come from. Sigmund Freud calls this free association. In fact, what he would do is he would have his clients sit on a comfortable couch and he'd start recording what they would think about and speak to. And he would be behind them so that they would kind of lose track of the fact that the most world-famous psychiatrist of the time was sitting there writing down everything that they said. And so free association meant that they would just go all over the place, which is basically the same thing as going into the library and just picking up some random book and start reading that. And then 10 seconds later, we throw that book down back in the pile and pick up some new book. And start reading out of that for a little bit and then throw that book down. So what we can begin to do is to practice having wholesome thoughts, which is the same thing as kind of finishing a thought, to actually begin to read in sequence. Here's an example that I will give you. Many people have questions about— well, one is Jhana. And we talk about it in the sense of one wholesome thought after another, after another, after another. And we can equate that with actually reading a book. What do I mean by that? Well, how many of you have sat down to read a book or maybe an article in the web or something like that, and you get about a paragraph or so into the book and then you read something that you— that catches the mind and you start thinking about that while the eyes continue to scan down through the page. And by the time you get to the next paragraph or at the bottom of the page, you realize that you're not reading at all. The mind is just scanning, the device of scanning, but the mind is not reading what the words actually say. This is in fact what happens because we freely associate. We'll get one idea or one thought from the book, And then the rest of the book is our own ideas. We're not actually reading the book. So that's one of the reasons why people are not literate, is because it's not a matter that they can't read, it's a matter of that they don't pay attention to the reading. And so what we can say is then, if you start practicing Anapanasati you'll actually become better at reading. If you start paying attention to what you're doing— an example of that would also be driving an automobile. Most people, when they drive, they're driving off of, let us say, old stored memories. They normally are driving on roads that they've seen before, they've been on before, they know the road. And this is the major cause of accidents, is because people are not paying attention to the road. A really good driver is going to be paying attention to the road. Why? Because that road is not the same old road it was. It's a new road today, and you need to pay attention to what you're doing. It's amazing like that, that people just get into the habit of thinking they know what they're doing, and then they'll just let the mind spin around rather than paying attention to what the mind is doing. And so this is why I give the idea of this thought of turning the cell phone on so that it gives an alarm once every hour. And when that hour occurs, you actually have at least one wholesome thought. Maybe the only one wholesome thought is, well, I'm glad that alarm rang. 'Wow, I'm really glad that it reminded me to be happy.' That's the only thought that you have, and then you can just turn it off and go back into your misery. But if you keep practicing, you'll begin to have more and more wholesome thoughts, because we're practicing having wholesome thoughts. This is in fact what we should be doing when people There is a word called meditation that people are beginning to, in the West, begin to pay attention to. But normally when people are meditating, they're just sitting there with all their old unhappy thoughts. They're not actually practicing, but they're meditating. This is especially true with systems like the noting method that is associated with Mahasi Samadhi, in the sense that you note that unwholesome thought, and then you note the next unwholesome thought, and then you note the next unwholesome thought, and that's supposed to be of value to you, rather than noting the thought and then changing the thought. So this, the actual teaching of the Buddha, is a change model.. It's not a noting model. And then the other kind of meditation that's common in the West comes from the Vajrayana, which they call choiceless awareness, which means that they're aware of their thought, but they're not taking any choices to it. Now, the example that I give for that is imagine that you're walking down the street, walking down the sidewalk, and there is a pile of dog doodle right in front of you. What are you going to do? Well, if you're having choiceless awareness, that means that you walk right into it because you can see the dog doodle, but you're not making any choices. You're just going to step right in it. Well, that may in fact be better than the noting method, because the noting method is that when you see that dog doodle there on the street, you're going to pick it up, take it into the kitchen, slice it, dice it, powder it, fry it, and eat it. What the Buddha would recommend instead is when you see that dog doodle as you're walking down the street, just step out of the way. Don't step in it. So we can think of that as those unwholesome thoughts, is that we have the choice of not having an unwholesome thought simply because we can see it coming. But this needs practice because we are really, really, really good at stepping in cow pies. Now, one of the reasons that that happens is because we get the idea that there's a goal ahead. I've got to go get my goal. And what is my goal? I want to get what I want. And if I get what I want, I'll be happy. So imagine the farmer with his hip boots. He's going to go visit his cows, maybe give them some shots or something like that. But he's got to cross the entire pasture to get there. So you're over on this side of the pasture, the farmer, and the cows are way over there. So the idea is to keep your mind on the goal, keep watching the goal because the cows are kind of moving around a little bit. You got to keep the eye on the goal. You've heard that before, right? Well, guess what? If he is watching the other side of the pasture, how many cow pies is he going to step in on the way there? Because he's not watching where he's going, he's watching where he wants to be. So this is what we mean then by practicing for what this thought is, rather than trying to get something that we don't have and planning and plotting to get it. Let's look at what is this thought, this thought, so that we can practice correctly with this thought. Now, going along with what Ivan was mentioning, he was talking about, in fact, that those people who are well-practiced— and let's divide people into 3 groups: the beginners, those in the— and what we're talking about here is the beginning is good. If you are actually practicing in the beginning, which means that you're going to have a mixed bag, you're going to have wholesome thoughts and unwholesome thoughts, but you're beginning to have a few wholesome thoughts over and over again. And then it's good in the middle, where you now are quite expert at having wholesome thoughts, and you only have wholesome thoughts, one wholesome thought after another after another. This is where we're getting great benefit. From Anapanasati is in the middle. Why? Because all of the new Sankhara that we're putting in are all wholesome, and we're not putting in any new unwholesome thoughts. But in the end, it's like we don't even bother to put more wholesome thoughts in because we've already got a wholesome mind. And every thought that we have kind of naturally is now wholesome. We're not digging into that garbage of the Samsara, of the old. We're operating within the new. So this, the term Arahant, or the one who is accomplished— and by the way, the Arahant actually means one who was worthy of gifts, who was worthy of respect. Why is that? Is because his job now of the Dharma is easy because he's not adding a bunch of junk to his memory base. However, the Arahant can still walk and talk and eat food and live his life, but he is not adding any unwholesome stuff to it, or anything hardly at all. So, Brad, You have a.

**Speaker C:** Question? No, sir. I was merely taking notes on your definition of the Arahant because I like that.

**Speaker A:** I wanted to keep that down. Okay. So this is what we didn't mean about there's two kinds of Samsaras. The Samskara of the old that keeps piling on the unwholesome stuff. And then we have the piling on of the same kind of Samskara, except all of these are new.. But once we get to the state of the Arahant, we don't put much new stuff in because we're operating now. We're in the groove, let us say. And so not much new stuff is happening. And so we're not putting any new stuff in that memory bank. We're just cruising. So these are the two kinds of Samskara that we're talking about. The old stuff is full of unwholesome, unhappy memories. And a few good memories. But look at it like that: when you start to memorize and look back on the past, it's pretty quick, without just a few thoughts, you're going to run across something that— ouch, I remember that, and that's painful. Many of our memories are painful. Why are our memories painful? Because when we have pleasure, it doesn't record in the memory system nearly as bigly as when we have pain. We record the pain because why? Because of our instinctual behavior. We are trying to avoid pain. We're trying to impact the system of instinct has to do with self-preservation. And so anything that was dangerous, anything that was hard, anything that was will record that in order to remain safe. But that's the ordinary mind. That's why so many of our memories are painful. Let us not remember things. Let's start forgetting and just be here in the present moment. So that would be then at the end of the goal, at the end of the path, where it's good in the end. Is where the, uh, the Arahant is not relying upon memory. He's fully conscious in the present moment because he's not digging in the past. He's actually not, uh, living in the past, and he's not recording stuff into the past. Does that answer your question, Ivan? Yeah, yes. 100%. Okay, so, um, Karwan, did I answer your question about pleasure? Dhammarato, sorry about my mic is not so well. Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you, but I only see the tip of your chin. I don't see any face there. All right. Yeah, thank you. I could— yeah, it was, it was good. Yeah, I was just thinking about how tiring it is to want things or to not want things. It's just very tiring. It is. But we'll do that thing even though there's a lot of work and very tiring, because we want that hit of pleasure. And we think that the only way to get that pleasure is by getting what we want. Why? Because we're not yet skilled at just being happy with what we already have. The way things are right now is good enough. And so we need to practice this and practice and practice over and over and over again, that everything that we've got right now is good enough. Well, I'm glad I didn't step in that dog poop, as opposed to many people who say, oh, there's dog poop on my path, I've got to go inspect that and find out why. Well, the Buddha didn't talk about inspecting the dog, Dukkha. He recommended just see it and avoid it. So, uh, go.

**Speaker C:** Ahead, Brett. So another definition then to the state of the Arahant would be the state where here now is good enough.

**Speaker A:** Right now is good enough. And he remembered that Here now, yeah, this.

**Speaker C:** Is.

**Speaker A:** It. Yep. That doesn't mean he doesn't remember anything, but normally what he does remember is quite wholesome, probably Dhamma. How many of you saw that little clip from Machan Po that somebody posted just recently? And what he said, the first question was, how am I? I'm happy. Happy.

**Speaker C:** Catch that?

**Speaker A:** Yes. Why are you happy? Because I practice being happy. He's 93 years old. He's been practicing. In fact, he's been the abbot of Wat Suwan Mok since 1969. He was already the abbot in 1969. He was born in the 1920s. He fully ordained in the 1940s, and he's been in the robes now for 73 years as a full Bhikkhu, but he's been actually in the robes from childhood, 86 years. And what does he say? I'm happy because I'm practicing. Does that make sense to you, Brett?

**Speaker C:** Yes, it does. I appreciate my friend Dean for sending that to me too the.

**Speaker A:** Other day. Yes, we are all friends here. In fact, that's the real practice, is practice being happy with yourself. Be friends with yourself, be nurturing yourself. If you're critical of yourself, guess what? You're going to be critical of a whole lot of stuff because your habit is being critical. And what is criticism? That means it's broken and I'm going to fix it. Yeah. As opposed to nurturing thoughts, which are the everything is already okay. Donald Trump is okay. Nothing to do. Yeah, Putin is okay. There's nothing to do. Let them go play the way that they want to play. That's not my problem. My problem is, in fact, to not have any problems. So I have to remember to not make Putin my problem, because he's not mine. He's not going to do what I tell him to do anyway, so why should I want to think about thoughts of what can I tell him to do? There's no opportunity, both on the physical as well as a psychological level. So Hedgeface, what do you have.

**Speaker C:** To say?

**Speaker A:** One thing I can say is that I just want everyone to like know, if you haven't found that out already, over time the effort required to replace the unwholesome with the wholesome really does get easier and easier and easier and easier. And at some point it will become almost effortless, except when life is really intense. So let's use an analogy for that. When a student, little kid, first sits down to the piano for piano practice, maybe he's got already a teacher, What's the very first thing he does? The very first thing he does is put his finger on the keyboard and presses a note.

**Speaker B:** Is.

**Speaker A:** That right? That's all. I mean, everybody at the beginning of everything, they just do it one time. So let's use the analogy of a drum. How do you play a drum? Let's see that this is the drum head, and this is the mallet. Is this the way that we play the drum? I mean, this is what they think of as meditation, is to take the mallet and put it on the drum like that. Is that the way that we do it? I don't hear any nos out there, so I guess people think that this is the way that they play a drum. You've never had drum lessons, have you? No, you gotta hit it, you gotta hit it, you gotta hit it, you gotta hit it over and over and over and over again. And hopefully by doing so, you're going to be getting some rhythm, some meter. And that when the child is learning to play the drum, the first thing that he is taught is how to hold the sticks and then hit one and then hit the other and then hit the other and then hit the other over and over and over again. And pretty soon he begins to do a drum roll. What is a drum roll? That means that the roll is hitting those thoughts, or the— excuse me, the drum head is being hit very quickly with one drumstick just hitting it over and over and over and over and over and over again. This is what we want to practice, is hitting those wholesome thoughts over and over and over and over again. The same thing is true with the piano, except that we've got more than 2 sticks. And so we begin to learn to play. Yeah, we've got 10 sticks and 88 keys to hit. And so we have to practice learning how to do a scale, which is C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C. Okay, so we learned to do an overhand and underhand. We learned to play chords, etc., like that. And chords and scales are how people learn to practice before they ever learn how to play music. Okay. And if you can learn how to practice your scales of wholesome, happy thoughts one after another so that you get your chords right, you get yourself in tune. Then your life becomes music. Your life becomes music because you know how to play the instrument that you've got. So this is what we have to do. We have to actually practice. And yet, even though I keep talking about it over and over and over again, People don't practice over and over and over again. They'll say, "Oh, I'll do it later." "Oh, I'm not up to it." "Oh, I'm busy." "Oh, I've got stuff to do." Why? Because they're looking for pleasure in all the wrong places. We can gain that pleasure that we're looking for very quickly But as I mentioned before, there's not much pleasure when the pleasure comes really easy. But if you keep hitting that pleasure button over and over and over again, it's going to get really pleasurable. But you got to keep doing it because a little bit of pleasure is not enough. You want a great big job to do that's really hard to get done. And when you do it, Now you get a great big hit, a big pleasure. And so we can begin to change that from working really hard to get a great big pleasure into having little pleasures over and over and over and over and over again. And guess what? We wind up having more pleasure than we did by trying to get stuff that we wanted. Does that make sense to you, Hatchface? Oh yeah, absolutely. And it comports with my experience for sure. So Christina, what do you think? Yeah, thank you. I think it was a great talk to tie in, you know, understanding Samskara and how it relates to pleasure. I think both Ivan and Karwan. While there were different questions, I thought you tied them in really, really nicely. Thank you. Okay, there we get both get pleasure from that one. So Potato, what do you think?

**Speaker D:** Thank you, Dhammarato. Right now I was thinking about how to consider the body as its own thing, so Anatta, because it's like the mind is the fictional president of the body, and a bad president uses the body, the population, to serve itself, but it is really the servant, but not by listening to all of the whims of the body, but by treating it correctly. And I was thinking that when I'm in my final moments, I want to feel like I treated my body with care. And that means also not following the desires that don't treat.

**Speaker A:** It nicely. Yes, we can get easy pleasure by just taking care of the body. Get pleasure by brushing your teeth and gain pleasure by shaving, by washing— easy pleasure. But we need to practice being pleasure rather than brushing the teeth out of duty, where there's no pleasure to it. It's just something that you're supposed to do. So whatever you're doing, take pleasure in doing it. Remember that there's nothing left for you to do except just have pleasure. That's what you're looking.

**Speaker D:** For anyway. Right. Yeah. Not out of duty, but out of that sense of caring, caring for. And yeah, it's kind of a wholesome thought, a wholesome action. In that way, I express.

**Speaker A:** My care. Okay. Matt, what do you have.

**Speaker E:** To say?

**Speaker D:** I really appreciated the parable of the.

**Speaker A:** Sewer and the cheeseburgers.

**Speaker D:** I've been happily chucking hamburgers into the sewer.

**Speaker A:** So yeah. Yes. They float. The hamburgers float. They don't sink to the bottom and become part of the sewage. They do seem to float.

**Speaker D:** I can feel like the little blast.

**Speaker A:** Of satisfaction that comes from the wholesome thoughts, even one in the midst of a bunch of unwholesome.

**Speaker B:** Ones.

**Speaker A:** So good stuff. Thank you. Anna, what do you have to say? Yes, you, Anna. I can see you. Yeah, but I can't think. I just couldn't find the button. So I only can say thank you. And I enjoyed the piano lesson. Thank you. Mr. Ben, what do you think? How about you, Nabeed? What do.

**Speaker B:** You think? Well, thank you, sir. Yes, it's so powerful and so simple. That the mind just doesn't want to believe it sometimes. But every time I tried what you said, it works. I had lately had somebody who tried to really get me to get on their side of their political views, and I keep telling them I don't even want to be involved. But, you know, I had to use this method many times, and I just saw how wonderful the results are. Especially when you're confronted with something.

**Speaker A:** Like that? You know that when you identify with politics, that means that you are giving away your feelings to your idea, your ID, of being in this political party or that national group or whatever like that, which means then that when something good happens for that party, you feel good, but when something bad happens to that party, you feel bad. And there is constantly a mix of good and bad and good and bad and good and bad in all political parties. And guess which one we wind up feeling? We begin to feel bad because we're not really registering the good. We register.

**Speaker B:** The bad.

**Speaker A:** Yes, and because of that, politics actually, in order to get your vote, they want to make you angry, they want to make you unhappy, they want to make you feel that you've got to go do something so that you can feel good. But if you already feel good, you're not going to be much value to that.

**Speaker B:** Political.

**Speaker A:** Party. Yes. So Rose, do you have something to say? So back to you, Mr. Bean. What do you have to say? I saw you turn your mic. There you go. Yeah, thanks for the talk, Dhammarato. Yeah, happiness really is here and now whenever we remember that it is. Yeah, great to be able to choose to enjoy the moment because it's all we've got, so you may as well enjoy.

**Speaker B:** It, right?

**Speaker A:** If you can remember, that's what this is really all about. That's what Sati means, is can you remember to be here now? Can you remember to look at what you're doing? Can you remember to look? Because if you can remember to look, you can see. And when you can see, you can change. And when you change, you can congratulate yourself. And all of this is part of the Buddha's Eightfold Noble Path. It's just couched in language that's difficult to understand. Remember to look and to look and to remember to keep looking and looking and looking so that you begin to see clearly. And then when you see clearly, you can say, uh-oh, I gotta change that. When we change it, wow, I feel so much better. An example of that would be you've got a splinter. It may not be a big one. But it's there in the finger or something, and you look and you look and you look until you finally find that splinter. And when you find it, then you can get to it. But a lot of people do an awful lot of digging trying to find the splinter rather than just looking. But if we look and we see that splinter, we can see it, we can pull it out, and wow, what a relief it is. So how many mental splinters do people carry around with them? Political parties, religions, all of those are many multiple splinters. So let's look at what pains and pull it out. So Sean, do you have something.

**Speaker F:** To say? Thanks for the talk, Dhammarato. Yeah, I'm actually sitting here with Matt, so there's a couple of us listening.

**Speaker B:** So thank you.

**Speaker F:** For that. Yeah, I think I mean, there were many things that like, I think they hit us so hard that because we've been trying this for a week or so now, and there's this feeling that, I mean, especially when you said that the Arahant remembers that everything's okay. I mean, we started laughing so hard because that's the core of it is that like, for whatever reason, I seem to forget And like you said, then get kind of caught up in my little plans and designs of like what I'm trying to do. I think the other really thing that hit pretty hard over here was that realization that our mind is designed to remember painful stuff. And that, like, it's like we're behind the 8-ball in that regard. If we're just going to let it randomly pick up a book, it's going to be a book about some.

**Speaker A:** Painful thing.

**Speaker F:** That just made so much sense.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Thanks. And in fact, to carry along with that, how many people have written happy books? Almost every book that's ever been written, especially about philosophy and history, is a terrible tragedy. Their subject is war. Dhamma books. Well, isn't it glad we have some wholesome books out there?

**Speaker G:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** So you can choose which kind of books you want to read: happy, wholesome books or unhappy books. So, Destin, do you have something to say? Nope. Ivan, back to you. Nothing. Just laughing when you said how many books was written by unhappy people. Yeah. In fact, that's the whole point of writing a book. Guess what? I've never written a book. I'm not unhappy enough to write a book. Well.

**Speaker D:** Some people here are writing it for you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, up to them. So Ivan, I have a request for you. Yes, make sure that Shepherd watches this video because it's for him. Oh, okay. One wholesome thought, just one will do, because he's the one who said that even when he— when the bell rings, he doesn't want to practice. Yes, one wholesome thought. So does anybody else have something to say? I think we covered everybody here. Brett, do you have something else.

**Speaker C:** To say? Last Wednesday I had surgery, stayed up all night before, which I may have done anyway, but I practiced at least half the night, and I'm glad.

**Speaker G:** I.

**Speaker C:** Did Anapanasati breath meditation.

**Speaker A:** All your hip thoughts be happy thoughts. Thank you. So, Mikey, why don't you take this thing away? Can I ask a question? Yes, go ahead.

**Speaker E:** I'm waiting. Hi, my name is Gerard. I'm Matt's friend here, and I've been sitting in. This is kind of the first time I've been introduced to this type of practice. Yeah, I think it's really great. Thank you so much for sharing it. And I love the idea of like, you know, changing the thought into a wholesome thought. It's like, you know, making the cause to make yourself happier. And I really like that idea. I was going to ask you, so for just for the concept of being like having the anger element, And I wanted to understand your thoughts around being, I guess, using angry for maybe like a just cause. As you know, I'm getting the sense that angry, obviously I can see that just angry for any purpose can make us unhappy, right? But if we were maybe to use like angry for like a just cause to like maybe save someone from suffering or like do some help, some injustice. Like, what are your thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Around that? Let me say it like this. Anytime that anyone is angry, they will find a way to justify that anger. All anger is righteous anger. They're right, you know. That's why they're angry. They're pissed off. Well, why are they pissed off? It's because the only option is to feel at a loss, to feel afraid, to feel like that they're disappointed and missed something. And so anger is always a cover-up for disappointment. And we feel powerful when we're angry. We think that we'll get what we want by being angry. Does that work? Does that ever work? Do you ever get what you want by being angry? No. You might get arrested. You might get hurt. Brett, yes, go ahead.

**Speaker C:** And I'm not positive, but I have heard and perhaps noticed that anger often gives the mind something to feed on that is a false sense of clarity and is not clear at all, and very well could be confusion hiding as.

**Speaker A:** Something else. Right, that's where that idea of righteous anger comes from. Yeah, that's exactly right. And righteous anger is merely just justifying my wrong bad feeling anger. At least I'm doing the right thing, so I tell myself when I'm angry. Okay, in fact, you could go so far as to say every war that's ever been fought, whether it's in the kitchen, in the bedroom, on the battlefield, in the political wings of the big offices, wherever that war is, Those wars have always gotten started because people justified their anger or justified some other wrong or bad feeling. We justify that, in fact, we justify having, you know, like some people will say, "Well, they're my thoughts," when in fact that's not even true.

**Speaker E:** They're just thoughts, right? Well, sometimes I just think of people like someone who feels, sees an injustice, and their idea of understanding like, this is wrong.

**Speaker A:** Hang on a second. Hang on a second. They see something they don't like, and immediately they say that what I don't like should be fixed. Without just recognizing it. Oh, they don't like it like that. Then in fact, in politics you can find it kind of broken into two different groups. Whatever one group likes, the other group doesn't like it. Well, your group likes it, and therefore you want to justify.

**Speaker E:** Doing that, right? Yeah, I was just thinking of like— sorry.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, go ahead.

**Speaker E:** Well, I was just thinking of like Gandhi or Martin Luther King, like someone who's seeing injustice and using that kind of like as a catalyst to change in.

**Speaker A:** That way.

**Speaker C:** Well, anger wasn't the vessel. I would say then that surrender through equanimity, however it was arrived at and over time. And in the case of Mahatma Gandhi and non-resistance rather than resistance, where anger being a movement of resistance, would you say that was so, Dhammarato?

**Speaker A:** Yes, and I'll say this further. What happened to Gandhi? Did he wind up happy? What happened to Martin Luther King? Similar. They both got shot. Yes. Because they made other people unhappy. Precisely. Precisely so. So why are you glorifying Gandhi? He really screwed.

**Speaker C:** Things up. I'm not merely saying that anger is not the vessel, and that is what I said.

**Speaker A:** Right, okay, so Gandhi would have screwed up even worse if he'd have been angry at Nehru.

**Speaker C:** Right, that's what I said, or intended to say.

**Speaker A:** So at least he was doing it peacefully, but what he was doing is questionable. Yes. What Martin Luther King was doing, he did it peacefully a little bit, but it was questionable. In fact, a whole lot of people A lot of them who had guns thought that what Martin Luther King was doing was quite violent. Million Man March, that doesn't sound nonviolent at all.

**Speaker D:** Does it?

**Speaker A:** If both of them had practiced the Dharma, they would have said, "Wow, guess what? I can sit here and be happy." Martin Luther King can sit in his church and teach all of the people in his church to be happy. Don't worry about what's happening in Atlanta politics, just be happy. Because he didn't fix anything, he made it worse. So I've forgotten your name on Matt's screen.

**Speaker E:** What's your name again?

**Speaker A:** My name is Gerard. Gerard. So what do you think about that, that what Gandhi did was not.

**Speaker C:** Effective?

**Speaker E:** Well, what do I think about that? I don't know. I think sometimes I think that it's hard for me to stay happy. When people around me are suffering, when I see people and the cause of a lot of suffering.

**Speaker A:** You know what I would have to say about that? Get away from them. Go spend your time with happy people. Don't spend your time with unhappy people. And if you can't find happy people to spend your time with, go spend your time alone. And get yourself happy alone. The Buddha was very big on seclusion. I didn't talk about that today, but getting away from all of those unhappy people. They affect you. They've been affecting you for years, and you continue to let them affect you. But the Buddha was a lion. He didn't let any of those unhappy people affect him. So you practice letting people not have any influence on you. You be happy no matter what they do. They're not who you are, and you already know that. So don't give them— don't give them that power. And in fact, most of them are prone to anger because they're not getting what they want. And what are they really doing? They're looking for pleasure that they don't find because they're not getting what they want. So you go have pleasure. You be satisfied with what you've got. But you have to practice that because you've got an awful lot of history of being unhappy because you didn't get what you wanted. So can you practice? Can you go off and be in seclusion and say, hot dog, I feel so good? Yeah, I seen Anna nodding. Yeah, hot dog, I feel so good. I don't need any of those people in New York to make me feel bad. I can feel good all by myself. So anybody else got any questions? All right, Mikey, why don't you take this thing home?

**Speaker G:** Yeah, thanks for being here today, friends, and Nice to see some new friends here as well, as well as some old friends that haven't been here in a while. So yeah, if you guys are watching this on YouTube, go ahead and check out the video description to join us here on Dharma Friends. We're actually going to hang out for a bit longer as Dhammarato goes away, and we're just going to kind of keep chatting about the Noble Dhamma. And our hangout space here on Dhamma Friends is Excellent spot to make noble friends who practice the Buddha, Dharma, and can talk with one another. And yeah, just keep sharing that joy, that joyfulness, that satisfaction, that peacefulness. So yeah, thanks for being here today. Take it easy. Take care. Don't worry.

**Speaker A:** Be happy. All right. Yes, the Open Sangha Foundation was down for a day or two. Thank you for alerting us to that. And so Mikey, Mr. High Tech himself, got the website back up and running. And so thank you for that, Mikey. Give you a pat on the head or a pat on the back for that, or maybe a pat on the butt for having gotten the website back up. It's got a lot of stuff that you can reference, including access to all of the, Google Drive files that we have. We've got a huge, huge library, even though it's all dumped on the floor. So I highly recommend that you don't hang up now, but that you stay and talk. That's especially true, Brett. You stay because you've got something to offer. And Kawan, you stay, you've got something to offer. And so, uh, with, with Ivan and, uh, uh, Mr. Bean, and Christina too. Christine's got a lot of offer. And maybe we can even say that Anna is the star of the show because she's been around a long time. Not me. Not me. Okay, so you guys stay on and introduce yourself to each other and talk about what we've been talking about today. Encourage each other to practice, and we'll see you later. Thank you all, my friends. Thank you for coming.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Thank you, Dhammarato.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A), centers on the nature of **pleasure** and how to cultivate genuine happiness through mindful practice. Here is a structured summary:

### **Core Theme: Two Kinds of Pleasure**
1. **Low-Class (Sensual) Pleasure**  
   - Comes from getting what we want through the senses (food, entertainment, praise, etc.).  
   - It’s a **two-step process**: desire → fulfillment → temporary happiness.  
   - This pleasure is unstable, requires effort, and is shared with all animals.

2. **High-Class (Non-Sensual) Pleasure**  
   - Comes from **not wanting anything**.  
   - It’s a **one-step process**: “I don’t want anything, isn’t that marvelous?”  
   - This is true happiness, free from hunger or dissatisfaction.

---

### **Key Teachings & Practices**

1. **Shift from Unwholesome to Wholesome Thoughts**  
   - Unwholesome thoughts: wanting, cruelty, aversion (e.g., anger toward politicians).  
   - Wholesome thoughts: contentment, kindness, “may all beings be happy.”  
   - **Practice**: Replace unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones. Don’t just note them (as in some meditation styles)—**change them**.

2. **Practical Exercise: The Hourly Alarm**  
   - Set an hourly timer. When it rings, pause and generate **at least one wholesome thought** (e.g., “I’m glad to remember to be happy”).  
   - Start small—even one thought is progress. Build up to longer periods of sustained wholesome thinking.

3. **Samskaras (Mental Formations)**  
   - **Old samskaras**: A disorganized “pile” of mostly painful memories (the mind naturally recalls pain for survival).  
   - **New samskaras**: We can create new, wholesome mental habits through repeated practice.  
   - **Goal**: Layer so many wholesome thoughts that they cover the old “sewer” of negative patterns.

4. **The Path of Progress**  
   - **Beginner**: Mixed wholesome/unwholesome thoughts.  
   - **Intermediate**: Mostly wholesome, sequential thoughts (like reading a book with focus).  
   - **Arahant (Accomplished)**: Abides in natural wholesomeness; “here now is good enough.”

---

### **Analogies & Insights**
- **Library of the Mind**: Untrained mind = books piled randomly. Training = organizing thoughts sequentially.  
- **Driving & Reading**: Accidents happen when we drive/read on autopilot. True safety/understanding comes from present-moment attention.  
- **Dog Doodle on the Path**: Don’t inspect or engage with unwholesome thoughts—just step around them.  
- **Farmer Crossing a Pasture**: If you only stare at the goal (cows), you’ll step in cow pies. Pay attention to each step.  
- **Drum/Piano Practice**: Happiness is a skill built through repetition—like practicing scales until music flows naturally.

---

### **Community Discussion Highlights**
- **Anger & “Righteous” Causes**: Anger is always a cover for disappointment and never leads to true good. Even figures like Gandhi or Martin Luther King created conflict; the Buddha’s way is to find happiness independently, not change others.  
- **Politics & Identity**: Identifying with groups gives away your inner peace—you’ll feel bad when they “lose.”  
- **Self-Care as Pleasure**: Find joy in simple acts (brushing teeth, caring for the body) without seeing them as duties.

---

### **Final Encouragement**
- **Happiness is a practice**: “I’m happy because I practice being happy” (quote from a 93-year-old monk).  
- **Seclusion can help**: Avoid unhappy people if they drain you; cultivate inner joy alone.  
- **Stay connected**: The Sangha (community) supports practice—share experiences and encourage each other.

**Overall Message**: True happiness is not about getting what you want, but about **not wanting**—cultivated through moment-to-moment training in wholesome thoughts. Start small, be consistent, and remember: “Here now is good enough.”

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by Speaker A (Dhammarato) to illustrate the teachings on pleasure, thought patterns, and meditation:

### **Metaphors & Analogies**

1. **Two Kinds of Pleasure**
   - **Low-class pleasure**: Sensual pleasure (food, entertainment) gained through a "two-step process" (I want → I get → I feel happy).
   - **High-class pleasure**: Non-sensual pleasure from "not wanting anything," a "one-step process" (I don’t want anything → I’m happy).

2. **Lasagna at Home vs. Restaurant**
   - The pleasure of lasagna at a fancy restaurant isn’t just taste—it’s enhanced by the "setup" (dressing up, waiters, ambiance). This illustrates how we mentally add layers to sensual pleasure.

3. **Happiness and Hunger (Bhikkhu Buddhadasa’s book)**
   - Sensual pleasure is like fulfilling hunger (for food, music, etc.).
   - True happiness comes from "no hunger at all"—being free from wanting.

4. **Sewer and Hamburger Layers**
   - Old, unwholesome thoughts (samskaras) are like a **sewer**.
   - Adding wholesome thoughts is like **piling hamburgers on top**—they create a new, clean layer that covers the sewage below.

5. **Disorganized Library**
   - The untrained mind is like a **library where all books are piled in a heap**, open and chaotic.
   - Practice is like **organizing the books**—putting them on shelves so you can find space and clarity.

6. **Reading a Book but Not Absorbing It**
   - Many people "read" but their minds wander—eyes scan the page while thoughts drift. This illustrates **lack of mindfulness** and free association.

7. **Driving on Autopilot**
   - Most drivers operate on "old stored memories" of the road, not paying attention to the present moment. This leads to accidents—a metaphor for **unmindful living**.

8. **Dog Doodle (Poop) on the Sidewalk**
   - **Noting method (Mahasi)**: Like picking up the poop, examining it, and eating it—engaging with unwholesome thoughts.
   - **Choiceless awareness (Vajrayana)**: Like seeing the poop but walking right into it—being aware but not choosing to avoid.
   - **Buddha’s way**: See the poop and **step around it**—acknowledge unwholesome thoughts and let them go without engagement.

9. **Farmer Crossing a Cow Pasture**
   - If you only stare at the goal (the cows on the other side), you’ll **step in cow pies** along the way.
   - Metaphor for being so fixated on future desires that you ignore present-moment pitfalls.

10. **Learning to Play Drums or Piano**
    - Beginners start with **one note** (one wholesome thought).
    - Practice is like **repetition in music**—hitting the drum or playing scales over and over until it becomes natural and rhythmic.
    - A well-practiced mind makes life **like music**—harmonious and pleasurable.

11. **Splinter in the Finger**
    - Mental suffering is like a **splinter**—you must **look carefully** to find it, then remove it for relief.
    - Many carry "mental splinters" (political/religious identifications) without examining them.

### **Stories & References**

1. **Greeks in Buddha’s Time**
   - Historical reference to Greeks becoming bhikkhus during the Buddha’s era, suggesting early spread of Dharma to the West.

2. **Therapeute in Alexandria**
   - Suggests a link between Theravada Buddhism and the Greek term "Therapeute" (root of "therapy").

3. **Epicurus**
   - Highlights similarities between Epicurean philosophy and Buddha’s teachings on pleasure.

4. **Ajahn Maha Bua (Machan Po) Clip**
   - References a 93-year-old monk who says, "I’m happy because I practice being happy"—embodying the talk’s message.

5. **Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.**
   - Used to discuss "righteous anger." The speaker argues that even these figures created suffering by engaging in conflict, and suggests that true peace comes from inner happiness, not external activism.

6. **Student’s Alarm Clock Practice**
   - Anecdote about a student who set an hourly alarm to practice wholesome thoughts but felt resistance—used to illustrate the habit of seeking pleasure through desire.

7. **Sigmund Freud’s Free Association**
   - Compared to the untrained mind randomly grabbing "books" from the disordered library of thoughts.

These metaphors and stories collectively emphasize:
- Shifting from **sensual pleasure** to **non-sensual contentment**.
- The importance of **replacing unwholesome thoughts** with wholesome ones through repeated practice.
- **Mindfulness** as a present-moment, choice-based practice (avoiding "dog doodle" rather than analyzing it).
- The ultimate goal: **being happy with "here now," without wanting anything more**.
