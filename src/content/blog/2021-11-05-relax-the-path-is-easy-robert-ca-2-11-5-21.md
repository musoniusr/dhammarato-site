### Transcript


**Speaker A:** is here. So, yes, you were saying that that over time that the teachings of the Buddha became polluted. And one of the ways of thinking about that is that everyone who comes to the teaching of the Buddha, including before the Buddha himself when he was still a Bodhisattva, he too was coming to the teachings from ignorance. Now, as he said, that this is an old path or an old method. It's been known before, and there is fairly good evidence that it's been rediscovered in the West from time to time, and that individuals come up with the whole point of that. You can see that in Stoicism in ancient Greece, and in fact you can see it in the teachings of of Jesus. You can see it in many places, this teaching or this awakening, that we don't have to do it the way that we were taught to do it, that we can figure it out for ourselves and we can feel the way that we want to feel.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And ultimately, every one of us makes their own morality. And in fact, all of us do from childhood. Some of us listen to rules and they make up our morality based upon the rules. But all along, we're always living up to— or not living up to, but let us say living against our own standard of morality. And most of the time we fail. At our own standards.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** And the reason that that's true is because we started as a failure in diapers, that we all start out as infants, we all start out making one mistake after another and slowly learning from it. But somewhere along the line, we were taught that if you make a mistake, you're supposed to feel bad rather than learning from it.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, yeah.

**Speaker A:** That somehow you're not good enough if you make a mistake. That when the other kids, for instance, tease you, instead of teasing with them back and everybody having fun, you wind up feeling a victim again, and you withdraw, and you resent what they're doing, when in fact they're just having fun. Yeah, expense, or off of your mistake. But that's okay, you could have fun off of it too.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that partly I have seen, in fact, in Thailand. And one of the situations that started me to think about this kind of stuff was when I saw a group of about 5 or 6 teenagers dancing and prancing down the street and having fun, and one of them falls down, and the other group turn around and look at him, and everybody's laughing. And he's laughing too when he gets up. Now, now, the young kids in the United States, they'd laugh and he'd feel bad, and maybe the teacher would come out and help him. But after they become teenagers or young adults, if one of them falls down, everybody feels bad and, oh, come, let me help you up. Oh, are you harmed? And women really do this even more than men. But they still do it. And so we wind up feeling bad about our mistakes and we try to hide them. This is one of the sources of deceit, is because we're not living up to our own standards, but we can't see that and do it joyfully. So anyway, back to that story originally about, uh, the issue was, is that everyone comes to these teachings ignorant that we can in fact feel the way that we want to, but that we feel the way that we do often because we are taught that way. Now, the feeling system is already there. That's what we inherit. That's the instincts. So fear is an instinct, anger is an instinct, But also great jubilation and joy and celebration is instinctual. But our society promotes one over the other. Instead of promoting celebration and joy, our society promotes it from the position of, I can make money off of your labor, therefore you do what you're told to do.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so it has to do with that, that greed-ill will relationship that always, uh, anytime that you find greed, there seems to be ill will associated with it. And anytime that you find ill will, you generally find greed associated with it. And it generally has to do with the kind of zero-sum game idea or mentality. So that could be said is the original delusion. The original delusion is people think that we live in a zero-sum game, when in fact it's not a zero-sum game, that it's a win-win game that everybody can win. We don't have to have winners and losers and have winners all, but that's part of our culture. And you can see that that's actually what comes out of the wild, that that's kind of a wild mentality, that unfortunate dinner had to pay for the meal.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** Uh, so, uh, or the other one is that if, uh, If you're not an invited guest, you're on the menu. Mm-hmm.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. With us, we're getting stuff.

**Speaker A:** And so this is how we came out of it with the kind of a dog-eat-dog mentality. And now it's nothing but the human-eat-human mentality with various degrees of Violence. This is our nature. This is where we then come to the fact that that kind of lifestyle has dissatisfactions. It's not the best way to live. It's the way that we came out of our ancestry that needed those instincts for survival. Now that we're not in a survival situation, we can recognize that things are not nearly as scarce as we thought they were. Yeah, in fact, don't live in a scarce world. We live in a world of plenty. There's plenty enough for everyone. Yeah, but we've been mentally in a world of scarcity because— and so that's what's to be overcome. Is to come out of our scarcity mentality into a wealthy mentality, to come out of the victim into the champion.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah. Have you heard of the idea of positive versus negative motivation? So like negative motivation is sort of aversive and then positive is like desirous, but there's no lack there. You know, you feel like you have enough. And then you want even more on top of it, sort of. So it's sort of like switching from that to, you know, escapist kind of negativity motivation.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's exactly right. In fact, that's one of the subtle issues about affirmations or the power of positive thinking, is that down under that is that we know deep in that quasi-intellectual but definitely emotional level, we know it ain't true, we know it ain't so.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. And so that sets up into a state of longing or greed or wanting to have it rather than affirming the fact that we've already got it. So that's why it's mislabeled. They call it an affirmation. It's not actually an affirmation. It's a wannabe.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that makes sense.

**Speaker A:** Even 'may all beings be happy' kind of Metta meditation is still a wannabe rather than an affirmation of, 'Wow, wouldn't it be nice if everybody was as happy as we are right now?' Yeah, now that's the attitude of generosity. Rather than the attitude of, "Oh, may all beings be happy, even me." So, it really does have that attitude issue built into the package. And so, everybody comes to the Buddha, or comes to the teachings of the Buddha, the Buddha-Dharma, and we use the Buddha-Dharma in the sense of now, not talking about an individual like Sakyamuni or the Tathagata, we're talking about, uh, awake Dhamma, or let us call it wisdom. And Dhamma actually in this sense is, um, there's many different definitions of the word Dhamma, but one of the words that easy to understand is the word thing. Just like Tathagata means thisness, or here, or right in front. The word Dharma means thing, and so Dhammakaya then would be the entire body of all things.

**Speaker B:** Right, right, gotcha.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and that the Buddha-Dharma, you could say it is, it's the Buddha thing, or another way of saying it, it's the wise thing.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so Buddha-Dharma means the wise thing. That's basically And all we have to do in any particular moment of time is just do the wise thing rather than the instinctual thing.

**Speaker B:** And right, so I'm guessing the wise thing is to just be happy anyway, right?

**Speaker A:** Well, absolutely, in the sense of why not? I mean, if you've got a choice between being unhappy and happy, which would you choose?

**Speaker B:** Being happy, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the same thing with Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, it's your choice. That's the entire teaching of the Buddha right there. That's it.

**Speaker B:** Right. And so I'm guessing that meditation is us developing the skills to be able to do that, to be able to perform that sort of mind control, direct mind control, where we just be happy anyway. Is that like sort of the point of meditation then?

**Speaker A:** Well, you could say then that it might be better to use the word when we're using the word meditation, it has many connotations because it was one of the words that was stolen from the Catholic Church. I think that in fact the Catholic Church ought to take that into court and take their word meditation back and sue Buddhists worldwide forever using the word. That a much, much better word would be practice.

**Speaker B:** Praxis. Yes. Yeah. Practicing the Dharma. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** The Buddha taught that. That's what the really important word is. And the Buddha used that word or something close to that and stressed it in the sense of thus one trains oneself, that thus there is the path, or this way one trains oneself.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I see, I see, I see, I see, right, right. And yeah, yeah, so it's like practice makes perfect. Well, that sort of— you try to

**Speaker A:** make it good enough.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, yeah, I guess that's what I meant to say, but yeah, more accurate version of the— yes, yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, so in the time of the Buddha, there were certain teachings that seem to have been really, really spot on, and that they were often are generally done in classic verse to make it easy to understand and to remember. And the suttas are set up that way. That's why they always start off with Eyo di Suttam, or thus I have heard.

**Speaker B:** Right, right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, this is what I have heard. And they start off like that, and then it always gives a short introduction generally of where the Buddha was, and they're trying to set a setting. Because they didn't have calendars then. They would have definitely dated the thing if they knew how to do that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

**Speaker A:** So, but there's also a lot of indications because we put together kind of the life of the Buddha and we know what it was like. Good in the beginning and what texts went along with that, good in the middle and what went along with that, and then good in the end, which is what it eventually became. Yes, yeah, that, uh, that in fact you could— we can actually now date the Dinga Nikaya to the time of Asoka. We can date the Abhidhamma as much later than that, but, uh, mixed in with the time of the commentaries and all of that was done, uh, before the turn of the millennia. And so, uh, but the main— of the Majjhima Nikaya, we know that that was done at the time of the death of the Buddha, which meant that this was the current stuff that they were already reciting, and that when they went to that council, that's what they did, is they recited all of this stuff to make sure that they were all in line with it.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And many people, because Ananda's name is mentioned so often in the Majjhima Nikaya, they kind of gave the idea that he recited all of it. To where really he was there with the Buddha most of the time. So he was familiar with what was happening, but he was not solely responsible for putting these sutras together. It was already well-known literature that this was kind of the decisional process of, yes, this is what the Buddha taught.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And Mahagasapa was the one who ran that, but he was not going to let Ananda into that. Recitation, because Ananda did not figure out the teachings of the Buddha finally until after the Buddha was dead. That Ananda was so dedicated to taking care of the Buddha and so devoted and all of this, that, and the other thing, that he knew spot on every word and was very, very sharp at it, but he didn't get it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that, that, that happened.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But he finally figured it out. But he didn't figure it out until it was pointed out that he didn't figure it out. And it was only after they pointed out that he really didn't get all of this anyway, that that's when he put two and two together, finally, that there actually really is a switch that you have to throw inside of your own mind of are you going to be a victim Are you going to be the lion here?

**Speaker B:** It's very interesting that you mentioned this, actually, because I did. The first sort of person I contacted was a guy called Vincent Horn. Can you hear me?

**Speaker A:** Yes, I know.

**Speaker B:** I can. Yeah, yeah. I can hold it up like this if it's a bit better sound.

**Speaker A:** That's a better sound. Brilliant.

**Speaker B:** Um, so, um, he does like a— he offers like a— the first session is free, sort of. So I was like, well, I'll check him out. Um, I'd, um, I'd watched his podcast before, Buddhist Geek's podcast. Um, I'd read his website, and, um, I like— I, you know, he— I was, I was at the moment, at the time, I was, I was, I just read Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha by Daniel Ingram and, um, Contemplative Fitness by Kenneth Folk. So I was very much in the pragmatic Dharma sort of, um I was at that school, so to speak, right? Yes, right. Yeah. So I contacted him and I said to him, this week I've had this really weird change in my practice, whereas all I need to do to sort of enter into like what at the time I would have called like equanimity or fourth jhana would be to just remember that I can. Or just remember that the truth is already true. And then I'd just pop into it and I'd be in this, like you said, this just sort of abundance mindset mentality where I'd just be like, I just wouldn't worry about things, right? I'd run based on just— well, I mean, I don't know, it feels a lot more effortless, right? Because I wouldn't be running based on worry and stuff. And so I'd lose a lot of the sense of being a doer and all this sort of stuff. And he said, yeah, that's That's very interesting, and that's sort of normal. So I'm guessing like that's sort of what you're talking about, is that experience of where you can just like, just in an instant, just switch back into that Dukkha, Nirodha state.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** And I said to him like, it feels like there's no suffering there unless I try to look for suffering, and then there's suffering, because— but it's almost like I'm creating the suffering in a way by looking for it. But if I don't— precisely so.

**Speaker A:** Precisely so. That's the whole point. That, yes, really, that gives me a

**Speaker B:** lot of clarity, man. That gives me a lot of clarity. I was kind of worried because I was like, I thought I was supposed to be noticing like, like Dukkha and the three characteristics. Where have the three characteristics gone? You know,

**Speaker A:** anytime anything changes, we can actually understand that in a physical science, meaning if something moves An example of that would be there could be a floor that you're standing on and that on the floor there is a particular color. Let's just say, for instance, it's brown because it's a wooden floor and there happens to be a wood tick sitting on that floor, perhaps in the crack or something like that. But he's just sitting there. You can't see him, but you're not looking for him. But if you happen to be looking at the floor when he's crawling across the floor, you'll see him.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, no, 100%.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that is what Anicca is all about, is if we're looking in the right places, we can see what's moving.

**Speaker B:** Right, right, right.

**Speaker A:** That's the study of Anicca, because it's also an introduction into the cause-effect.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that's saying that things are moving, and in fact, things that move catch the eye, and that when it catches the eye, we kind of make a note or a dot of it. And wisdom is all about connecting the dots. And in fact, another Robert that I had, who is a good friend, he said something that a cliché that somebody had used in public or whatever like that, and he got a great big kick out of it because it fit right into what we were talking about. And he says, and I'm going to go use that with my dad. And I said, wait a minute. You have already been connecting this dot, these sequence of events. And so when this one happened, it was like a big serendipity, a big aha, those things fit in and I really understand what's going on. Your dad's not going to have that same response to that cliché because he has not got it set up. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. So what we're talking about here is not then those kind of peak events that Western meditation people are looking for, but whether we need to start recreating that sequence of events and that result over and over and over and over and over and over again until it's no longer a peak result. It comes into the position of I can do this.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's like that's the winner's attitude

**Speaker A:** because it's still the victim Who is right? So it's still the victim who is searching after those peak experiences.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, of course, right? Yeah, of course.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right. But when they become absolutely ordinary— now here's, here's the part about it, is, is that somehow a lot of people get the idea that fourth jhana is a peak as opposed to the first jhana, that somehow fourth jhana is somehow better. Than the first jhana. Yes, that's the standard way of looking at it. And that's the way that the Buddha thought also. And that's why he gave up the jhanas, is because he did them all. And then he changed whole systems and went over to the jhānas and started doing with Mahāvīra and started practicing the jhānas. But he already had his mind so rightly geared that he could do all the self-flagellation, the starving himself and pestering himself and all that kind of stuff. And so then he fell into the creek. You know the story. And he gets up out of the creek. And what is the thought? He says this is the point in time when he remembers when he was young, sitting under the rose apple tree and had the first Jhana. Now, that meant that already he knew what he was talking about when he was a teenager, which gives a clue to the fact that he had a teacher. And in fact, we even know the teacher's name because that teacher was the same one who, when he was born, told the king, he prophesied that this child is going to be a Buddha. He's not going to be a wheel-turning monarch. You've heard that story too. So that's the same guy then that was with the Buddha when he was out traveling doing all of this stuff. And he was also one of them who was the one who became Srotapanna in the first talk that the Buddha gave. This is Khandana. All right, so he's well known. And the point that I'm bringing up about this is that when he figured out what was going on, it was actually easy enough to talk to his friends because they already spoke the same language. And this guy just got What? And he just got it right there. Most of us need to make these connections over and over and over and over and over again until we— now we get it. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Because that's the way that human mind works. It works in a sequence that what we do is we connect the dots. We're looking— we think we're looking for the truth, but what we're really looking for is serendipity. Yeah, what we're really looking for is synchronicity of things happen this way and they happen that way and they do. And so this is actually then the study of cause and effect, of seeing the fact that things are in cycles and everything is happening over and over and over again. And it comes up with the attitude that the Buddha talks about in very specific words. That I like to translate into modern slang English as 'been there, done that.' Start having the attitude of 'I've been there, done that.' Yes, yes, yes, done that. Been there, done that. What does that mean? Been there, done that means that when I've been there and done that, then I am now the champion. I don't even have to go back and fight that battle anymore. I've been there, done that, right? And one of the places where the Buddha used that phrase was when he was talking about what he's being accused of, because what his enemies were accusing him of was being an atheist. But the expression that they used was, upon the breakup of the body, the existing being is annihilated. All right, well, that's what atheists believe. When I'm dead, I'm dead, but until then, I'm alive. But that's not what the Buddha taught. He says, both formally and before, I teach only one thing, and that is Dukkha and Dukkha Nirodha. You can see it and come right out of it. That's all I teach. And then he was saying that though some people revile me Still, on that account, there is no dejection of the heart. And though those who revere me and escalate, even with that, there is no elation of the heart. And why is that? Because I've been there and done that before. I've been criticized. I got over it then. I can get over it now. I've been praised before. Before, I can get over it then, I can get over it now. Except really now, because I've been there, done that, I'm really good at getting over it, whatever it is. Which means that now we don't have to hold grudges anymore because they can't touch you anyway. I mean, yeah, you— people have tried to hurt you before in your past and they weren't able to do it. You survived.

**Speaker B:** Very true.

**Speaker A:** Or another way of saying it is, is that revenge is not only a dish best served cold But revenge, the very best revenge is living well. Yeah, yeah, living well is the best revenge. You can't touch me. Hey, I'm living high on the hog. It doesn't matter what he tried to do to me.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, so this is all a part of that attitude, that been there, done that, and that we can handle with reverence. We can handle the reviling. We can handle it all because it don't mean anything, because It's not me. But that's the whole point, is that it's not me. Whoever you thought I was, basically who we are in reality, we are what we were told to be. That's what we are. We are what the sum total of everything that anybody's ever said about us, and whether we agreed with them or not and whatnot like that. And so that's all we are, is just the sum total of the superego, when you're speaking in reporting in terms Well, guess what? That's like a blank slate. You can wipe that thing clean and write up there what you want to. You could remember what you want to remember. You don't have to remember what you thought that you had to remember because you were told to.

**Speaker B:** We sort of recreate ourselves just in the present moment.

**Speaker A:** That's just right. And that's the only time that we can do it, is create ourselves in the present moment, because the past is gone.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** We can't fix it. The future is yet to be, and so it doesn't exist. Neither the past nor the present exists. And not only that, but way over yonder doesn't exist. The only thing that exists is what's right in front of you. That's what comes in with the senses. Anything else— so if you and I start talking about, ain't it awful what happens in Washington, DC with all the politics, we're both just speaking in concepts. The Washington, DC is not real for either one of us.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, 100%. I'm in the UK, you're in Thailand. We're just— yeah, it's just— yeah, for

**Speaker A:** me, Thailand is real.

**Speaker B:** We don't even have to think about it, right?

**Speaker A:** We don't have to think about it because it's just a concept, right? We can think about what's happening now instead. We don't have to think about over there or back then. Because those things are not real.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. It's funny, I actually, I've been practicing something similar, just sort of intuitively, since I sort of started to realize that I could, right? Which was when I was talking, which was before, you know, a couple of weeks leading up to my conversation with Vincent Horn, and there was like one thing that would always bug me and make me sort of lose this very this very clarified happy state would be that like, if I don't worry about this thing, then something bad will happen, right? I won't be able to handle it. But then counterintuitively, the longer and more I practiced it, what I started to realize was that actually I handle things even more effective. I've got even better creative problem-solving when I'm just not worrying about them. And like, that was just like the biggest, like, I guess just like mindfuck, mind-blowing experience.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** It's just like we worry ourselves to death.

**Speaker A:** We get tired of worrying about something and it doesn't help.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But often our worry hides the intuitive right answer of our wisdom that will pop up when we just look at what's going on. We can see it directly. But when we're worried, we're talking ourselves into feeling bad and feeling like I'm a victim and whatnot like that. Well, in fact, there was no problem anyway. There wasn't really— wasn't any problem ever. Anyhow.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and another thing I noticed was that I was worried that if I didn't worry about things, I would forget them. My memory actually got better because, like, whenever I'm, like, anxious, I sort of, like, I get, like, a tunnel vision with my memory where it's like I can only focus on one thing, you know. It's like I'm sort of obsessing over it. But when I drop that, it's like, oh, now I can remember my whole, like, future and my goals and my whole past and everything. And, like, all of that just got, like, cleared away by doing this practice.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's exactly right.

**Speaker B:** Brilliant.

**Speaker A:** Not only that, but it's well known, well talked about, well documented, and in many cases, well experienced. And that, in fact, that's part of what is so remarkable about people like Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, is everybody can see that this guy has a huge memory. He knows stuff because he's read it. So much of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa hasn't been published into English yet. And so, oh yeah, here's an example of that. There is one room, big room, in a library that's dedicated to just works by Bhikkhu Buddhadasa in the National Library of Thailand. They've got a whole room separated just for his work.

**Speaker B:** That is— yeah, my big respect to him. Wow, that's impressive. That's very impressive.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it's— it, uh, it is. So anyway, yes, good memory. Let's get back to the rose apple tree though.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** Do you know what he did under the rose apple tree?

**Speaker B:** A rose apple isn't a Bodhi tree, is it?

**Speaker A:** Actually, the Thai word for it is 'chumpoo,' and that word is also used for the word 'pink.' When the rose apple is ripe, it becomes pink color, but it's still, even as it's ripening and green, is still good enough to eat and very sweet and delicious. It's somewhat shaped like an apple, and it probably was given the name rose apple by the British.

**Speaker B:** Ah, yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so trumpu is the Thai name for it, but you can actually Google and get an image for rose apple trees. But anyway, it wasn't the rose apple tree itself, but that's in Buddhism. The key word for people to remember that that rose apple, because that's the story that the Buddha did something under the rose apple tree. What was it?

**Speaker B:** He became enlightened.

**Speaker A:** No, that happened in Bodhigaya. He was a child. It was when his dad was doing a plowing ceremony. He was sitting out. He wasn't in the plowing ceremony. The prince should have been out there doing the plowing ceremony, and he was hanging out under the tree instead.

**Speaker B:** Right, right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so what is he doing? What did he do under the rose apple tree? It's very famous. I thought you'd know.

**Speaker B:** Uh, he discovered— he decided that the middle way was the best way forward.

**Speaker A:** Um, he entered into the first Jhana.

**Speaker B:** Oh, right. Yeah, of course. You said— yeah, yeah, yeah, I already told you. Yeah, right, right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, he was in here. And so now that he's crawling out of the, uh, the, uh the creek that he fell into with the thought that what I'm doing currently now of fasting and starving myself and burning off the Kamma, and that's not working. That's when he reflected upon why am I— because I'm doing all these austerities and doing all of that for possibly months, if not years, because, you know, there's pictures of the starving Buddha where his His waist was so thin that he could reach it around. So we're talking about not 20-inch waist, we're talking about maybe 14-inch waist. So how could he possibly have survived that? And he almost didn't. It almost killed him. But then he reflected, why am I afraid of the pleasures of first Jhana? And then he reflected that actually the first jhana is the path to enlightenment. That's in the suttas. And then he repeats it for sure, that first jhana is the path to enlightenment. Then when you read Sutta 111, you find in there— by the way, this passage that I just described to you is in Sutta 36 in the Majjhima Nikaya. But in Sutta number 111, by the title of One by One as They Occur, or One by One, which means how do we— what actually, this is the answer to the question, what should be my meditation object? The answer is when you're in first Jhana, one by one as they occur. And as you do it one by one as they occur, that will naturally take you into the higher jhanas. That jhana is jhana is almost like a violin is a violin. Which string are you playing? Hmm. Once you've got a violin with one string, you've got all the tools you need to put 3 more strings on. Or another way of saying it is once you get relaxed enough for first jhana, that the other jhanas are just natural progressions of becoming a little bit more relaxed.

**Speaker B:** Right, right. So, oh man, I'm loving this. I'm loving this. Yeah, you make a lot of sense.

**Speaker A:** And well, it's in the sutras this way. I'm just repeating stuff that I've learned. And experienced from both, both the lineage with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and Aichan Po, and also back to the suttas, to the Buddha. So I've got three kinds of evidence: personal experience, a teacher who showed how, and also the original source. So I'm really lucky because Buddha didn't have that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Bhikkhu Buddhadasa kind of figured it out for himself too, but then that gave him the door opening to the old boys' club, that there had been a group already doing that for centuries. Okay, so this was the process of the Buddha figuring it out, that basically what we do is we get into the first Jhana and then we do the noting. What do we note?

**Speaker B:** The first jhana.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's exactly right, that when we are not in first jhana, there is all kinds of things, especially intentionally hindrances.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** So that's what people note if in a dry meditation practice they are actually developing the skill of Sati. What they're looking for, or what they're remembering to do, is to look at Dukkha, and that's what they find. First Jhana has already gone through the process of removing the hindrances. So when you're looking in First Jhana, what do you find? You find First Jhana. That's what you find.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And then in fact, in order to develop the first jhana, you have to actually be on the first jhana stuff. That's the whole point of it. And a good example of that is the issue of applied and sustained thought. Right. Each of the char— okay. The applied and sustained thought means that you can apply your mind to the wholesome. And then sustain it means that you guard the mind or you continue to apply the mind to the wholesome, or you sustain the mind in the wholesome. And you keep doing that. And so that is now your object of meditation, is to make sure that you are monitoring every thought We're making sure that it's wholesome. You're on guard now, and that's the quality of the first Jhana, is being on guard, guard duty. Sustain that. Yeah, get yourself in that state of relaxation. Yeah. And, and what is it are we are guarding are several things. One of the things, in fact, we're, we're, uh, what are we guarding is the Satipatthana. We are guarding the body to make sure that it's relaxed. It's guarding the feelings to make sure that there is Sukkha. It is guarding the mind to make sure that the thoughts are wholesome, bright, gladdening, uplifting. Everything's okay. Everything is fine. And by doing so, also, we're guarding the— we're beginning to guard the

**Speaker B:** Anicca,

**Speaker A:** Dhamma, Nipassana, or the things that are happening in the mind. Okay, so by guarding the mind, basically what we're saying is that the mind itself is the state or the condition of the mind rather than the objects of the mind. So in this regard, what we're doing is we're guarding the attitude or regarding the frame of mind of an Arahant. Okay, what are you going to feel as opposed to the actual what are you feeling? Hmm. Right. So that's that interconnection and that this is the Sukkha. So what are we going to be guarding is the Sukkha. And as we guard that way and begin to sustain this, especially in a longer-term practice over a period of time, we begin to get the idea that I can do this. And we begin to guard that attitude into being the champion, that confidence. Yeah, the winner, the confidence. And that's where this— that's when the Piti then kicks in. OK, now normally what happens in Western mind, very common, very typical, is that we learn to count 1, 2, 3, 4. And we learn that 2 is better than 1. 2 apples are better than 1. 3 is better than 2, and 4 is better than 3. 1, 2, 3, 4 in a sequence. And so we all get the idea that the higher the jhana, the better.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. No, I've definitely fallen for that.

**Speaker A:** All right. But we have to go back to the fact that the Buddha fell into that same trap. And he did all the jhanas all the way through. And yet he's decided that it was not worth his effort, that it was inferior, and he left. I mean, he actually left his teachers and the ones who were teaching the Jhana, and he was really good at it because he'd been doing it since he was a kid. So he was all in. Then when he went into the austerities, he was the absolute best they had. He showed them all how to do it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And even that wasn't enough. In fact, you could see that everyone who was doing austerities is doing it from a victim's position. You cannot be hard on yourself without victimizing yourself.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** That austerities are something that victims do. That's why the Buddha was so careful to minimize the number of austerities that people brought in with them from all the traditions when they would become a monk. They would try all kinds of things because they'd been doing it before. So they're just doing the same things. And right. And basically the only main austerity that the monk, that the Buddha allowed was barefoot. But that's an— and you can thank for the Westerner that it really is a bear— that's an austerity rather than a lifestyle. For some it's a lifestyle. Some people never had shoes. I wear shoes about 3 or 4 hours a month.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, nice one, man. Nice.

**Speaker A:** Because I don't have to. I've learned to walk on ground. And so only when we go to town, only when we have to go to the bank or do a visa or something like that. But other than that, there's no reason for it. And so it's not an austerity, it's a lifestyle. But in the beginning, definitely it was an austerity.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, that's how things tend to go, isn't it? They're always a bit rough in the start. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and changing your whole lifestyle or mentality out of the lifestyle that we have grown accustomed to is also a bit challenging.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, absolutely. It takes effort to sit.

**Speaker A:** And so that's why the effort is put in to practice over and over and over again. And the main thing that we're going to practice is changing the mind and changing the body and changing the feelings. We're changing the mind by gladdening the mind. We're changing the body by breathing deeply and experiencing the body with the intention of having it relax. And then in the feelings, we're doing that indirectly. When the body is relaxed and when the mind is gladdened, then the feelings will come by.

**Speaker B:** They follow.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, they follow along.

**Speaker B:** I like it. I like it.

**Speaker A:** And so

**Speaker B:** that's very clear.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And then eventually,

**Speaker A:** yeah, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I was going to say, and then eventually when you get good enough at that, you can, would you say that you can sort of interface with the feelings themselves and just change those with even less and less effort? So it's sort of, it's such minimal effort. It's almost like you're just changing the feelings just to happiness, just by sort of choosing to be happy, like the feelings themselves.

**Speaker A:** Right. When you get good at it and you know that you can't change it, but sometimes you don't want to recognize it. Sometimes you don't want to feel good. Sometimes you want to feel bad.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But generally we feel bad when we don't have to.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. I find with myself there's sort of like sometimes I have to go a bit like Metta on it. I have to really zoom out because I'll be like upset with myself for not feeling good. And then, well, I wasn't feeling good and now I'm even feeling worse because now I'm adding like this negative motivation to feel good onto already not feeling good. It's like, it's like I'm compounding it sort of. I have to sort of zoom out and just— it's a much more difficult letting go when there's, when there's that inner battle. But it has to be like this, sort of like a faith kind of thing for me. I find like I have to just be like All right, here we go. Okay, and then that'll get me on like sort of a nice momentum with it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay. Well, um, I often use the example of a roller coaster, and you're actually talking about it right now, that, um, kids who really want to ride the roller coaster, they see pictures of roller coasters, they'll stand back at that roller from the roller coaster at a distance and study it and look at exactly what it's doing, with great anticipation and excitement, they go get on the roller coaster. If they take Grandma, she's really kind of reluctant to ride on the roller coaster anyway, and so she really doesn't look at it. She just has to get— just get on and take it for a ride. But now when it feels like that it's going really strongly uphill, she thinks that's the roller coaster. And then it gets to the top and she thinks that's the roller coaster. And then it starts that first long downhill to pick up the speed that it needs to do the rest of the roller coaster. She thinks that's the roller coaster. All right, that's exactly how we live our lives, that whatever part of life that we're in, we think that that's it, that's the life. And we don't recognize, no, this is the whole thing. This life that we've got is just a roller coaster. Why you should have studied it.

**Speaker B:** That's such a brilliant metaphor, because I noticed that in my mind I do this all the time, where like I'll be in a really like a bad mood, right? And I'll be like, and all of my thoughts about like my whole life and the way it looks is all like hinging on this bad mood, right? It's all being affected by it. And then when I'm in a good mood, it's like, oh, everything's great. But you can actually go back and like notice, oh, that's just because I'm in this mood. Oh, that's just because I'm in this mood. Oh yeah, I've been here, done that, right? I've been here before, made a conclusion. And like now, now I can sort of just like notice and like bring myself back and that helps a lot as well. Yeah. It's like having that knowledge in the back of my mind can help me like sometimes, sometimes it's not enough, but sometimes, yeah, it can be enough to just be like, been there, done that. All right, let's reset, right? Let's reset the emotional system.

**Speaker A:** That's exactly right. Okay, so this is the power then of Sati. Because all we have to do then is just to remember that, to just put things on reset. Just to remember, let's reset this thing. That's all we have to do is just remember to push reset.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, brilliant.

**Speaker A:** It doesn't matter what kind of bad mood we've gotten ourselves into, and there's many examples. One of the ones that I like is that you pick yourself up, you dust yourself off, and you boogie down the path.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Except that the word path is problematic here because we've already discussed that this is not a path, this is a method. So another way of thinking about it, when boogieing down the path, the Eightfold Noble Path is the boogie and the path is life.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm. Yes, yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** And so we boogie on down the road, right? We just boogie on down the road. We pick ourselves up, we dust ourselves off, we boogie on down the road. That's, that's the reset. If you fall down, pick yourself up, reboot, clean things out, get everything, and have a ball. That's all there is to it. And we do that within one second. We do that within a second of time because it only takes an instant to remember. The next thought moment is gladdening the mind. The next thought moment is taking a deep breath. And here we go off into gladdening the mind and taking a deep breath, and we feel pretty good. And that's Anapanasati right there. That's the Satipatthana with the body, the feelings, the mind. And we're changing the mind's objects, which, by the way, that's the whole point, is to recognizing that's what Anicca is. Change your mind. You've got a choice. Change. The things are not permanent.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So it's not in the sense of Anicca is something to be observed. No, Anicca is something to do.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, yeah, there's, there's more to the Trilokana than just that, and that is, is that whenever anything changes If there is resistance to it, that resistance is already redefined now as dissatisfaction. So any resistance to it is dissatisfaction itself. And if there is resistance and dissatisfaction, who is it resisting? And who is it that's doing this dissatisfaction? That's the self. That Dukkha and the self are deeply interrelated. In other words, whenever the self-preservation instinct kicks in, it kicks in in the sense of preserving the self, which means that it's becoming selfish and also danger. This is dissatisfying. Dukkha is in fact the instincts.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And also Dukkha is the self of the instincts. Okay, in the sense of the nesting instinct— who's in the nest, in the territory, who's outside the territory. Okay, tools and the weapons— my tools, my weapons, etc. Like that. So all of those instincts are built into it. And so now that means that you can see Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta, or the Trilokana, as a teaching that has to do with an either/or, in the sense that it's like a fork in the road that we're traveling along. And now Anicca happens, which means now we have to make a choice or a change. We can either choose Dukkha and the selfishness that goes along with it, or we can take the road of, hey, it's not me. It's not mine. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah, we let go of our attachment to it. We let go of our, like, selfness, I guess.

**Speaker A:** So we're not giving it any resistance. We're not adding disappointment. The disappointment is something that we add.

**Speaker B:** Oh, dude, I just— bro, you just blew my mind. Dude, I do this all the time.

**Speaker A:** That's my job. That's my happy job.

**Speaker B:** I do this all the time when I'm meditating where, like, I'll have like, I'll become distracted by something, and then I'll feel bad that I'm distracted. And it's like, no, you've got to like, don't worry that you got distracted, you know? I feel like that's kind of like—

**Speaker A:** Be so happy that you caught yourself distracted. Arahant, I see you are.

**Speaker B:** There you go. There you go, yeah.

**Speaker A:** That's the correct way of practice. Because— We have to be free from all of that. That's the first jhana. So once we're in the first jhana, now the mind is fit for work. That's the brilliant part of it, that before we're in first jhana, the only job we have to do is to get rid of the hindrances. That's the first job we do, and we have to get on guard to get rid of them. Once they're out, now we can actually do the noting that needs to be done.

**Speaker B:** Now we have all this mental RAM and energy freed up that we can use to practice.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly. And in fact, to get in and maintain the Prajna, we're already doing the noting that needs to be done, which is to note that we're on guard, to note that this thought is wholesome, to note that I feel secure, to note that I feel comfortable, to note that I feel satisfied, to note Wow, this is really nice. Okay, to note that I'm relaxed, to note that we're in the Third Noble Truth. That's the whole point, is that we're only going to have notes of things that are wholesome. We're not going to be having noting of unwholesome stuff because we've already gotten ourselves into First Jhana and we have eliminated that. So in one way, we can only see Paticcasamuppada in the way that it looks after we're outside of Jhana. Well, that's the place that we get started anyway. So we get started up there at Dukkha and the self and all of that. And as we began to gain skills, there is a particular point where Bhikkhu Buddhadasa points out that Pasa is that point of contact, that's the place where we're in first Jhana. Why? Because now we're able to control the feelings. We can control the feelings and give ourselves the feelings that we want to have. So first Jhana there is in Paticcasamuppada at the point of contact, which means we've stopped the whole sequence already. We don't go up in there into the woeful states of the Dukkha and grasping and clinging and, you know, actually Vedana, Tanha, Upadana. Bhavana, Jhati, Dukkha. That's the sequence in Pali, but we're not going there. We've broken that sequence already when we're in First Jhana.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we broke out of the cycle.

**Speaker A:** As I said, enlightenment, or getting enlightened, is done in the First Jhana. That's the whole point of it, is that once you're in First Jhana, you're free. So that means that the first— so the first Jhana now means that we have to practice and sustain that state, that we have to get very, very, very good at it. Very good at it. That's the skill developed, is the skill. In fact, the Buddha talks about that, that there's three primary skills. But let's talk about the first two. And that is the first primary skill, is to be able to get into the first Jhana. The second skill is to be able to maintain the first Jhana. Okay, and then the third skill is to get out of the first Jhana. Well, now wait a minute, that's not a skill. Getting out of first Jhana is not a skill. Because the only option to the first Jhana at this point is the hindrances, to fall out altogether. You get where this is going for, especially in the sense that there is no place else in the suttas where the second, third, fourth, or any of the other states are ever mentioned as either something to be maintained or a skill to be developed.

**Speaker B:** I see, I see.

**Speaker A:** Only the first Jhana is the skill development stage to get yourself into the first Jhana and to stay there, because as you start to experience the wholesome, you will begin to go higher into the jhanas automatically, because that's your object.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, of course, right, right.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And not only that, but it's a travel into, uh, tranquility. It's a travel into, uh, calming things down intentionally.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, and if you're in the first jhana and you want to be in some other jhana, like you're not in the first jhana anymore.

**Speaker A:** You've already lost it and you've gone in the wrong direction. Okay, so here is where subtle aspects of the noble middle way, because the Buddha started talking about the middle way, that was the first thing that he talked about in the Dhamma Chakra Pavanta Sutta, which set up the Eightfold Noble Path discussion. But the point about the Middle Way is that most Western Buddhism sees the Middle Path in a particular kind of way. And they see that the Middle Path, if you think about it as a middle path between, in one respect, of the austerities that the Buddha practiced, or self- harm, which we could also just think of as unwholesome thoughts, that we're sitting there flagellating ourselves when we're thinking about, "Oh, you ought to be meditating." "Oh, I don't want to meditate." "Well, it's time for you to meditate!" That's self-flagellation right there. So, that's one end of the scale. But the other end of the scale, which the Westerners think about in the sense of sensual desire, they think about it as brothel. So you're either in the Catholic Cathedral flagellating yourself, or you're in the brothel. Those are the two extremes for the normal mentality of the middle path, somewhere in between those two extremes, right? Actually, what the Buddha was talking about was something kind of different than that, and that is in the sense that the middle path is the middle path between the sensual pleasures that he was talking about there actually can be re-understood in the sense of the pleasures of the jhanas, that people will lust for the higher jhanas. And this, by the way, was his first talk to guys who had been with him that whole time doing the jhanas and doing the austerities, to where the way that is taught to ordinary people, that's the distinction between the austerities and the brothel, way, way over there in the sense of wrong behavior or in a sense of sensual desire that you get in a brothel, where the Buddha may have, in fact, if you look at it correctly, can say that no, he's talking about the pleasures of the Jhana that people were lusting for. Real middle path is not going to be a middle path where your crash landing site is hindrances, but rather that your landing place is going to be the first Jhana. This is the real middle path between greed and ill will. The middle path between greed and ill will is having nothing to do with either one of them. That's the first Jhana. The first Jhana is the landing zone that we will call the Middle Path. And so we have to get on that Middle Path by developing the first Jhana rather than continuing to flagellate ourselves or continuing to lust for higher and higher states.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, yeah. Yes, it's being okay with what's here, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, yeah, and, and that whole point then is the great deal point about satisfaction. That's the Sukkha, is satisfaction, because that's the actually opposite of the Dukkha that we're trying to get rid of. And so when we become satisfied, that's all there is to it. If you want some higher pleasure, then now you're back into a state of wanting.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, you fucking— you— yeah. Yeah, you fucked yourself up, man. God damn it. Oh, that's good, man. That's good.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so once we have that kind of understanding, then we can begin to see that if I start paying attention to the wholesome things, the higher Jhana factors will make themselves available one by one as they occur.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Yes.

**Speaker A:** The first thing that we're going to look at is applied and sustained thought. Because when we can begin to put some gaps between the thoughts, that's the mind moments that we spend between the discursive thoughts are often spent in either direct observation and the senses or the experience of emotion. Which means if we start paying attention to the way that we feel after we've gotten ourselves into it, how good can you get? And that's the Piti that arises in peaks into second jhana, because that's all we're paying attention to, is how good I feel. That's all. Mark is the second jhana. I'm not talking to myself about how good I feel anymore. I'm just sitting there and enjoying how good do I feel.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** After a while, we begin to recognize that feeling that good takes a little bit of effort. And so we let that subside down to just Sukkha, to where we're just completely satisfied. Okay, but then that's when we begin to let go of the breath, just being completely satisfied in the state of Sukkha. Is now we can go in by letting go of everything, we can relax even further into Upekkha, one by one as they occur. So first we start looking at the thoughts which is the hallmark of the first jhana. That's what gets and establishes that first jhana. And then we start paying attention to the gaps of how good we feel. And then we let that how good we feel kind of relax, that it becomes— it's no longer a flood. Now it becomes a pond, kind of, in the third jhana, that we're just so satisfied. And then in the fourth jhana is when we can experience the Upekkha and all of the other stuff. But by now, remember, at first jhana we were at the point of contact. Now we're going down and started to look at perception itself. How do we actually manufacture thoughts? And so the mind not only is very, very stable and very serene, but it's also very sharp. Up and sees things that are happening at a very, very fast, much faster level. And when we really learn to control these perceptions, then we can just sit in sensory awareness and just let the Dhammakaya, or let God— oh gosh, you just feel so good— just, just, uh, yeah, just, just to experience reality in the senses without having to make sense of it at Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Without having to interpret any of it at all.

**Speaker A:** Without having to interpret it at all, that we can literally become that input that is just so surprised at being alive without having to think about it or plan about it or remember about it.

**Speaker B:** We're just— why would you need to, right? What do you need? What do you need when you're there? When you're that— exactly.

**Speaker A:** And so this is where the sensation of the perception and cessation of feelings occur. To where we're just there in sensory awareness, or down to the level of consciousness without having to have a layer of filtration added to it anymore. That's— but we, we do, we go into those states by inspecting our way into them. And this is all laid out very clearly in a number of suttas. But we get, as Westerners, we get greedy about these things, and so we're not capable of getting them because we have to always do it from a state of complete relaxation, complete serenity, complete 'get a load out of this,' rather than 'wow, wouldn't it be nice.'

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And so we're skipping over the first step, which is the That's Jhana, the satisfaction. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so that's why the Jhanas are so rare for Westerners. I'm not saying they don't fall into it. Yeah, they happen, they pop in and you get an experience, and then you pop back out, and now you want to get back into that experience, but you don't know how you got in there, and now you've got the greed for it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, you feel even worse.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. And, and so, uh, oh dude, I

**Speaker B:** think I've experienced that so many times. Yeah, it's like you get out of it and you don't know how you get back. And so you're just like struggling to try and remember. And then how you got back, but it's like, no, you just got to stop struggling, man. You know, you just make the push.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you got to stop wanting it. Exactly. You got to be satisfied with this present moment. How satisfied can you be is the Jhanas. And when you want Jhanas, You're not satisfied. You can't get it. Exactly. Exactly. That— this is the most classical Catch-22 that I know of.

**Speaker B:** It is. It is, man. It's like a— it's a paradox, isn't it? It's a strange loop. It's like there's one way in and there's one way out, you know.

**Speaker A:** Mhm. And so this is the key then to practice. So the next time you call, we'll actually go right into the Eightfold Noble Path and how these four things fit together precisely into practice of Anapanasati. This is all very, very well spelled out, but we've got the tools that we need to get started in the sense that these are skills to be developed. You have to develop Sati as a skill. You have to develop right inspection and investigation and look. That's a skill to be developed. With discernment. That's actually the development of wisdom itself, is looking, investigating.

**Speaker B:** And they've got to be balanced as well, don't they? Because if you have too much discernment without the satisfaction, you're just like sort of wasting your time. But if you have loads of satisfaction, but you're not discerning, maybe you get stuck. Or would you say, is that a little bit?

**Speaker A:** Exactly. When you develop the skills out of balance, the worst case is Sati only, and that's the Mahasimha.

**Speaker B:** With it

**Speaker A:** because it's only got Sati. It doesn't have the balance of the Shraddha. It doesn't have the balance of the wisdom. It doesn't have the balance of the joy. It just has the Sati. So it doesn't have those 5 things balanced. So you're exactly right. We have to balance those things, which means that we have to develop each one of them as a skill, and there's a way or an order that we do that.

**Speaker B:** I like it, man. I like it. I like where this is going. This is giving me so much clarity because I've read so many different books and different people's methods and techniques and their opinions, and they're always conflicting. But you're here saying like, no, all of the 5 strengths, they're 5 skills first of all, and all of them are— they need to be— they're all important, but they need to be in the correct balance. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** And you're not just like rejecting Jhana outright or rejecting Vipassana outright.

**Speaker A:** It's like, no, there's— Yeah, I'm not rejecting anything. We're putting it together, the puzzle of how all this stuff fits in. You can't throw pieces out because you don't like them. That's what they've been doing for centuries.

**Speaker B:** That's like, that's, I mean, that's like the whole point you're trying to fix, right? I like it. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Let's find out how all of this stuff fits in together because one example or one way of thinking is that we're not ever going to destroy or kill the instincts, and we wouldn't want to anyway. What we need to do is to know them very well in a very friendly way so that they become our allies and friends rather than our driving force.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yeah, yeah. So we're not like disowning, like making a shadow out of these parts of ourselves. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so that's the path, and it is easy peasy. I mean, it's just so wonderful. Well, once you practice and get the hang of it.

**Speaker B:** Good stuff, man. Good stuff. That's brilliant, man. I had like a whole list of questions and you've answered most of them just in your discussion already, which is excellent. Wonderful.

**Speaker A:** All right, Robert, we'll finish now. This has been a delightful conversation.

**Speaker B:** I've enjoyed it. I'm looking forward to this, man. I'm really looking forward to this.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. Excellent. Well, we'll see you.

**Speaker B:** Right. I'll see you soon.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Bye-bye. All right.

**Speaker B:** Ciao. Have a good day, man.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it is.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, primarily led by **Speaker A (Dhammarato)**, explores core Buddhist principles through a practical, psychological, and historical lens. Here is a structured summary of the key themes and insights:

### **Core Themes & Insights**

1.  **The Polluted Teachings & Personal Discovery:**
    *   The Buddha's teachings have become "polluted" over time. The core truth—that we can choose our own mental state—is an ancient, rediscoverable path evident in traditions like Stoicism and the teachings of Jesus.
    *   **Morality is self-created:** From childhood, we form our own standards, often based on external rules, and then feel like failures when we don't meet them. This stems from being taught that mistakes are shameful rather than opportunities for learning.

2.  **Cultural Conditioning vs. Innate Joy:**
    *   Society often promotes a **scarcity and victim mentality** (e.g., feeling bad about mistakes, "dog-eat-dog" worldview) over our innate capacity for **celebration, joy, and a "win-win" abundance mentality**.
    *   This conditioning links **greed and ill-will**, framing life as a zero-sum game. The Dharma teaches moving from a mindset of scarcity and victimhood to one of plenty and being a "champion."

3.  **The Essence of Buddha-Dhamma:**
    *   **Buddha-Dhamma** is translated as "the wise thing." The entire teaching boils down to a simple choice: between **Dukkha (suffering/stress)** and **Dukkha Nirodha (cessation of suffering)**. In any moment, we can choose the "wise thing" over the "instinctual thing."
    *   The goal is to **be happy anyway**, a direct form of mind control we can learn.

4.  **Meditation as "Practice" (Not Peak Experiences):**
    *   The term "meditation" is problematic; **"practice"** is more accurate. It's about **training oneself** to recreate a skillful mental state until it becomes ordinary and accessible.
    *   Western practitioners often chase **peak experiences** (like "higher" jhanas) from a **victim mentality**. True mastery is making the wholesome state commonplace and sustainable.

5.  **The Central Role of the First Jhāna:**
    *   The **First Jhāna** is the foundational skill and the **"Middle Path"** between greed and ill-will. It is the landing zone of satisfaction (*Sukkha*) where hindrances are removed.
    *   The Buddha realized the First Jhāna was the path to enlightenment. The sequence is: develop the skill to **enter** it, then the skill to **maintain** it.
    *   **Higher jhanas** are **not skills to be developed**; they arise naturally (*"one by one as they occur"*) when one sustains the First Jhāna and pays attention to the wholesome factors (like joy, satisfaction, equanimity) as they manifest.

6.  **Practical Mechanics:**
    *   In First Jhāna, the mind is "on guard" for wholesomeness. The practice is **noting and sustaining** wholesome states: relaxed body, pleasant feelings, gladdened mind.
    *   This is **Anapanasati** and **Satipatthana** in action: changing the body through breath, changing the mind through gladdening it, with pleasant feelings following.
    *   **"Reset" Button:** The power of mindfulness (*Sati*) is the ability to instantly "reset" the mind—to remember you can choose happiness, take a deep breath, and gladden the mind.

7.  **The Three Characteristics (Trilakkhana) as an Active Choice:**
    *   **Anicca (impermanence)** is not just something to observe passively; it's something **to do**—to *change your mind*.
    *   When change occurs, we face a fork in the road:
        *   The path of **Dukkha & Self**: Resisting change, adding disappointment, activating the self-preservation instinct.
        *   The path of **Anatta (not-self)**: Letting go of resistance and attachment, recognizing "it's not me, it's not mine."
    *   **Suffering is often what we add** to an initial distraction or unpleasant event (e.g., feeling bad about being distracted).

8.  **Breaking the Cycle (Dependent Origination):**
    *   The First Jhāna represents the point of **contact (*phassa*)** in the chain of Dependent Origination where the sequence leading to suffering is **broken**. One controls feelings and chooses wholesomeness, preventing the cascade into craving (*taṇhā*) and clinging (*upādāna*).

9.  **Integrating the Five Spiritual Faculties:**
    *   The path requires balancing the **five faculties/strengths**: faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom. Developing them as **skills** in the correct balance is key. An imbalance (e.g., mindfulness without joy or wisdom) leads to stagnation.

10. **Goal: Befriending Instincts, Not Destroying Them:**
    *   The aim is not to eradicate natural instincts (fear, anger, joy) but to **know them so well they become allies** rather than uncontrollable drivers. We integrate all parts of ourselves.

### **Key Takeaways for Practice**
*   **Focus on the First Jhāna:** Cultivate **satisfaction (*Sukkha*)** and the ability to maintain a wholesome, guarded, and joyful mind as your primary practice.
*   **Choose Happiness:** Moment-to-moment, remember you have the choice between stress and its cessation. Use your "reset" button.
*   **Practice is Skill Development:** It's not about peak experiences but about the reproducible skill of creating a wholesome mental state.
*   **Beware of Spiritual Greed:** Wanting "higher" states creates dissatisfaction and prevents the very serenity needed to access them. Be satisfied with the present.
*   **See the Big Picture:** Life is like a rollercoaster; don't mistake the current dip or climb for the whole ride. Use the **"been there, done that"** attitude to avoid being hijacked by temporary moods.

In essence, the talk reframes the Dharma as a practical, here-and-now method of **taking charge of one's mind** to choose happiness and wholesomeness, with the First Jhāna as the cornerstone of that training. The historical and textual references serve to strip away later accretions and point back to this simple, powerful core.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used in the talk:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Zero-Sum Game vs. Win-Win Game:** Used to contrast the delusional, competitive view of life (where one person's gain is another's loss) with the enlightened perspective of abundance where everyone can benefit.
2.  **"If you're not an invited guest, you're on the menu" / "Dog-eat-dog" / "Human-eat-human":** Vivid metaphors for the predatory, survival-based mentality inherited from our ancestral past.
3.  **Scarcity Mentality vs. Wealthy/Abundance Mentality:** Describes the shift from a mindset of lack and fear to one of sufficiency and plenty.
4.  **Victim vs. Champion/Lion:** A central metaphor for the choice between a reactive, suffering-based identity and a proactive, confident, and empowered one.
5.  **"Been there, done that":** Modern slang used to translate the enlightened attitude of non-reactivity to praise and blame, based on having fully understood and mastered those experiences.
6.  **"The best revenge is living well":** Used to illustrate the "champion" attitude of thriving regardless of external criticism or attempts to cause harm.
7.  **"Wannabe" vs. True Affirmation:** Distinguishes between a desire for a future state (which contains lack) and an affirmation of a present reality (which contains satisfaction).
8.  **Roller Coaster:** Represents life. The key is to study and understand the whole ride (the nature of experience) rather than mistakenly identifying with and reacting to every individual twist, turn, or hill (every passing mood or event).
9.  **"Pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and boogie down the path":** A metaphor for the quick "reset" of the mind—recovering from a negative state and returning to a joyful, engaged practice (the "boogie") in life (the "path").
10. **Violin Strings:** The Jhanas are compared to strings on a violin. Mastering the first Jhana (the first string) gives you the foundation and skill to naturally access the others.
11. **Computer "RAM":** Mental energy freed up by achieving a calm, concentrated state (first Jhana), which can then be used for deeper practice and insight.
12. **"Pushing Reset":** A simple metaphor for using mindfulness (Sati) to instantly recall one's ability to choose a wholesome state and let go of a negative one.
13. **Fork in the Road:** The Three Characteristics (Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta) are presented as a choice point: when change (Anicca) occurs, you can take the road of resistance and suffering (Dukkha, Self) or the road of non-resistance and release ("not me, not mine").
14. **Catch-22 / Paradox / Strange Loop:** Describes the self-defeating nature of greedily *wanting* the peaceful states of Jhana, which itself prevents achieving them. The only way in is through present-moment satisfaction.

### **Stories & Historical Anecdotes**

1.  **The Teenager in Thailand:** The story of a teenager falling down while playing with friends, laughing it off, and getting up without shame. This is contrasted with the typical Western reaction of shame and over-concern, used to illustrate cultural conditioning around mistakes and vulnerability.
2.  **The Buddha's Awakening (Narrated Version):**
    *   **Childhood under the Rose Apple Tree:** The story of the young prince Siddhartha spontaneously entering the first Jhana during a plowing ceremony. This memory later becomes pivotal.
    *   **Austerities and Near Death:** His practice of extreme self-denial and starvation, which almost killed him and proved to be a dead end.
    *   **The Moment of Realization:** Falling into a creek, he remembers the joy and ease of the first Jhana and realizes it is the true path, not self-mortification. This marks his rejection of the "victim" mentality of austerity.
3.  **Ananda's Enlightenment:** The story that the Buddha's attendant, Ananda, memorized all the teachings but did not fully understand them until *after* the Buddha's death. This underscores the difference between intellectual knowledge and the internal "switch" of realization (from victim to lion).
4.  **The First Buddhist Council:** The story of the monastic community gathering after the Buddha's death to recite and codify the teachings (the Suttas). The mention that the Majjhima Nikaya was solidified at this time and that Ananda, despite his knowledge, was initially excluded because he wasn't yet enlightened.
5.  **The Buddha's Teachers:** Reference to the Buddha having teachers (like Āḷāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta) in the Jhanas before his awakening, and his departure from them when he saw the limitations of their teachings.
6.  **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's Legacy:** The anecdote about an entire room in the Thai National Library dedicated to this monk's prolific writings, used to illustrate the clarity, memory, and profound understanding that comes from the practice.

These metaphors and stories work together to frame the core teaching: that suffering is optional, and through a shift in attitude and dedicated practice, one can choose freedom and happiness in the present moment.
