### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So how's your practice?

**Speaker B:** It's been up and downs, I think. So I've learned a lot, I would say. And especially I often get stuck in this feeling of, well, it's not good enough. There's somewhere else I can go which is better. And Yeah, I always have to remember that this is kind of the problem, that I seek something better somewhere else and not like in the now, not like here, that this is good enough, this moment right now.

**Speaker A:** Well, there's a very easy solution to that problem. When you hear those thoughts in your head or when you see those or recognize those thoughts about something else could be better, see that as a hindrance to being okay right now. That in fact what you're doing is you're lying to yourself by telling yourself that something could be better someplace else.

**Speaker B:** Right. Yeah, I've also, I've thought about a lot what does it actually mean to be okay. So I've thought about this, like when How does it feel to be okay? When is good enough? You know what I mean?

**Speaker A:** Well, it already is good enough. You just got the hindrances to see that because you keep telling yourself that there's got to be more, there's something else, or whatever like that, which is just a hindrance to say, you know, everything is actually is okay. We've got it. We got all we need. Everything is okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yes, sometimes I'm searching for this okayness in like, in thoughts or in feelings.

**Speaker A:** Or— Don't search for it, the searching for it is the problem. There's nothing to search for. Isn't that nice? There's nothing to search for. Wow, I can just relax, there's nothing to look for.

**Speaker B:** Yes, sometimes when I hear this word like relax, I immediately think of, okay, my— it means my body is relaxed. And in some cases my body is just not relaxed, but I can still be in that relaxed state of mind, right?

**Speaker A:** Well, I know that it's not because you keep telling yourself that it's not. You keep investigating that it's not. And you keep coming up with the wrong data. The just relax is to just relax, not asking yourself, is this relaxed enough, or am I relaxed? That's the hindrance. That's the looking for something wrong, testing, trying to figure it out. You don't need to do any of that. You can just relax. Oh, I don't have to figure out whether I'm relaxed or not.

**Speaker B:** Right, right, right. Yes, sometimes I think I have this scientist mind where I have to experiment and test something and evaluate whether this was good or this was not good instead of just doing.

**Speaker A:** Actually, in a most important way, the teaching of the Buddha absolutely is scientific, is far more scientific in fact, than most scientists, because most scientists are still in that mentality of "it's not good enough." Instead of just looking to see how it is. And that certainly, scientists are generally better off than all of the other professions, especially salesmen, politicians, cops, judges, all of those kind of professions have to make a bunch of judgments. And by doing so, they destroy paradise, just like Adam and Eve destroyed paradise because they kept judging. They kept figuring out what was right and what was wrong, what was good and what was bad, what was good and what was evil. And when we stop judging and say, all right, everything's okay already, I don't have to judge it. I don't have to see, am I relaxed enough?

**Speaker B:** All right, so for me it was fascinating because what changed, or what had, like, your teaching the most impact for me was I've been struggling before a lot with boredom, and I now recognize that this is the feeling of, well, me thinking it's somehow not good enough, and I need to get input, I need to get more input or more satisfaction. And this changed a lot because I can now be in that I can do nothing but still be at peace or still be calm, and I can always have this decision.

**Speaker A:** Actually, the word that you use, still, is your problem. If you take the word still out of it, you recognize that in fact the only way to be at peace is by stop doing stuff. Stop doing mental stuff like checking it out and seeing, do I really feel okay? But just keep repeating, everything is okay, without having to judge, is it okay yet? Because that questioning, is it okay yet, is what makes it not okay.

**Speaker B:** Do you mean by stop doing stuff.

**Speaker A:** Also Like, stop doing— stop thinking unwholesome thoughts. Stop needing to do stuff because you've got unwholesome thoughts. Like, oh, I've got anxiety, therefore I've got to go do something. I got to go fix dinner. I've got to go fix that program. I've got to go fix that data. I've got to go fix that motorcycle. Why? Because I have anxiety. And we have been taught our whole lives that the way to deal with anxiety is by going and doing something. And in fact, it generally helps anxiety only because when they go off to fix that program, to fix that data, now they're thinking about the data and they're not thinking about the anxiety. All right, but we don't have to go do anything. We can just play with that anxiety as if it were a toy. We don't have to get rid of it. It's already okay. It's, 'Ah, that's anxiety. Let me play with that. That's a new toy to play with right now.' It's okay to have anxiety. And if you have the idea that it's okay to have anxiety, you got a new toy to play with, the anxiety melts away. Aha, I see it come. I see it. Go.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** But if you have anxiety and think that you've got to go do something to get rid of the anxiety, it may not work. And in fact, people can go off and do stuff and be even more anxious because now they're anxious and uptight about what they're doing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Um, I think another hindrance— this was for me is that I sometimes think about progress, a progress in the practice. And I recognize that when I think about progress in the practice, it means that I think where I am right now is not good enough.

**Speaker A:** Good enough, right? That's why I want to tell the students to stop looking for progress. The story about The Pilgrim's Progress. It was an old book long ago, and during the Middle Ages, the pilgrims would leave Europe and go to the Holy Land. And they would get— when they would get to the holy place, what would they do? They'd only stay there long enough to rest up, and then they're back on their pilgrimage again, going to yet another holy site. Because the holy site that they're at now is not good enough. And so the habit of a pilgrim is to stay a pilgrim. And what we need to do is to stop our pilgrimage because you're already in the holy site. This is good enough. You're in paradise already. No place to go. Stop being a pilgrim and start being a permanent resident.

**Speaker B:** Right, right, right.

**Speaker A:** Um, stop trying to make progress. In fact, the word pilgrim has to do— Pilgrim's Progress, right? Stop trying to make any progress. You've already arrived. This is good enough.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm already enlightened.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you're already enlightened. That's what the Zen masters tell the Zen students. You're already enlightened. Stop trying to get anything. You've already got it. And when we actually come to understand that, then that is enlightenment. Until we have enlightenment and still want more, that's not enlightenment yet.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Basically, it's to just stop because you're already there. And every time that you have the thought of, oh, I got to go do something, or, oh, I've got to go fix this, or, oh, I'm not feeling good. All this is boredom. We can say, hot dog, I can see that boredom and I'm already okay. The reason that I'm bored is because I have been telling myself lies that I've got to go do something in order to feel good. And now you can just stop doing stuff and just feel good.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's.

**Speaker A:** A very simple but yet very profound practice.

**Speaker B:** I've been thinking, or I've been listening to your talks and I heard you talk about Noble Effort and I really wanted to ask what does Noble Effort mean?

**Speaker A:** The Noble Right Effort is to stop all the other efforts. To stop all the wrong efforts is the Noble Right Effort.

**Speaker B:** Right. I've been, because I've been practicing yoga a lot in the past few years, and I've been thinking if, because in yoga they talk about this union of body and mind, like right effort with body and with mind.

**Speaker A:** Okay, all right. But if you're already there, then you don't have to get that unification. That in fact, trying to get unification is not unification. Stop trying to get unification, and there it is. The mind is unified when you're taking the right effort to stop trying to get something that's not there. So you have what's there, and then you have what's not there that you want. That's the duality. When you stop wanting stuff, when you stop wanting, for instance, unity, then you're unified. But when you want unification of mind, there's the you, the reality that there is now, plus this thing that you want. That's the duality. But when you don't have that want for the unity, now you've got unity. Like I said, this is profound, and people struggle with this their whole lives, not recognizing what the Buddha actually taught was to see that wanting things Wanting what you don't have, that's the Dukkha. And when you stop wanting things, then you have satisfaction to be satisfied the way things are.

**Speaker B:** I think I read it somewhere. It was said that I think it's also from Buddhism that desire is the creator, desire is the destroyer, something like this. I don't know where it's coming from. Do you know it?

**Speaker A:** Well, that's Hindu. That's Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma. Brahma the creator, Vishnu the integrator or the perpetuator, and Shiva the destroyer. Okay, but the reality is that things are constantly being created, they're constantly being maintained, and then they're constantly being destroyed. Because there's so much there happening. Okay, so the origination, the continuation, and the destruction is still merely a concept. Yeah, but the reality is that things are in turmoil. Things are constantly changing, and that's okay. That's the satisfaction. Be satisfied with this is how things are. And how things are is constantly changing. Because if you're not satisfied with the way things are, that's Dukkha. And how are things? Constantly in motion, constantly changing.

**Speaker B:** Right, right, right, right.

**Speaker A:** And so the attitude then develops as a skill. The attitude develops is that it doesn't matter what changes, I can handle it. Because I keep watching things change and I can see that I can handle it, and therefore confidence grows. And what is that confidence? Confidence is that I can handle whatever the new thing that comes in, in that change. Yeah, probably first confidence would be then— in fact, it stated this way— that no matter how obstructed the mind gets with hindrance, the student knows that he can clean that mind out with all those unwholesome thoughts all those hindrances and come back and see things the way they really are. Now, that's the first knowledge. And then the second knowledge is becoming completely satisfied with that to the point of just relaxing.

**Speaker B:** I'm sorry, can you repeat the first practice and then the second? Or the first knowledge, sorry.

**Speaker A:** Yes, the first knowledge is the confidence that no matter what happens, no matter how obstructed the mind gets, I can clear that mind out and come back and see things the way that they really are. See the truth of the matter. And what is the truth of the matter? Things are constantly changing, but that's just their nature. That's okay. You're the one who makes it okay or not okay through your judgments. So when you stop judging, you can just enjoy the show.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm just the observer of this game that's unfolding here, right?

**Speaker A:** Actually, observation is there, but you're not the observer. There is just observation.

**Speaker B:** Right, because this concept of me dissolves when I'm just observing.

**Speaker A:** Just observing into just observation. But when it's me that's observing, that's when the judgments— I want— comes in. And what was just the observation? Just enjoy the show.

**Speaker B:** What was the second knowledge again? I'm sorry.

**Speaker A:** When you have that knowledge that everything is okay in the sense that you can handle it no matter what, no matter how obstructed the mind gets. Then, the second knowledge is that you can in fact relax. You can completely relax into that. That's the Samatha. You've heard of Vipassana, Samatha? Okay, the real Vipassana is the point that no matter what happens, I can handle it. And then the Samatha is, it's okay the way it is, and so I can relax. And then the third knowledge is the complete eradication of doubt about what is and what is not the path, what is and what is not, because you've been practicing these first two things, which is the number one is that no matter what happens We can just stop all of that and see things the way that they really are. All right, that's the personality view. The I Am is the I Am fixer that's fixing what's broken. All right, and then the second one, the relaxation, comes in in the sense that there's no more shoulds, woulds, coulds. There's no rules, there's nothing. You see, the way that we live our lives is we have these standards, these ways of thinking, and then we check reality against the set of rules that we have about how things should be. Now, Eric Berne and Sigmund Freud stumbled on this and labeled it the superego, the ego, and the id. And then Berne relabeled it to the parent, the adult, and the child. So you can think of it this way then, that the parent is the one who sets the standards, has all the rules, tells you how things ought to be. And that was when you were a child, you were ordered around all over the place. You had to do what you had to do whether you wanted to or not. Those are the rules. You got to go to school, for instance, is one of the big ones. Every day you got to go to school, and then at school you got to do this, you got to do that, you got to dress the right way, you got to read these books, you can't lose the books. How many rules have you been putting up with all of these years?

**Speaker B:** Infinity.

**Speaker A:** Well, not infinity, there's just a lot.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Too many to count, not worth counting. But that's not infinite. But there's still no end to them until we put an end to them. And because we can put an end to them all, it doesn't matter anymore. And so basically what we have inside of our mind is a dialogue between the parent and the child. You ought to do this. I don't want to do that. You ought to do this, but I want to do something else. Okay, so the desires and the wants and the feelings are from what we would call the child ego state, the reptilian brain, the more primitive part of us. It's driven by our feelings. And then we have the mammalian brain, the temporal lobes. It has all of these rules. And most people are in this war, this duality between what they want and how things ought to be.

**Speaker B:** Right, with themselves as well.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly. And so what we're going to do is to move out of the parent, move out of the child into what is called the adult ego state, which is that which is just seeing things the way that they are. The adult in the room sees what's happening. The parent wants it to be this way because of the rules, and the child wants it to be that way because of his feelings. And all we have to do then is just to see that no matter how much obstruction of my desires or how much obstructions of the rules that apply, I can let all of that go Anagami, see things the way that they are, come into the adult. And when we keep doing that over and over again, we finally just relax.

**Speaker B:** So it's first the realization that I'm confident enough, I can handle everything. And then there's— and then there's even your own death.

**Speaker A:** You can handle anything. And then handle your house burning down. You can handle the mortgage. You can handle a divorce. You don't even have a divorce if you can handle it. The only reason why people have a divorce is because they can't handle a marriage, and then they can't handle the divorce.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. But then it comes to, I don't have to handle anything anymore because it can all be just good.

**Speaker A:** It's just there it is. It's not my job. In other words, the handling it that we're talking about then is to just let it be without having to go and fix it. That's how we handle things, is by not having to handle it.

**Speaker B:** Right. And what is— what, what was this, uh, the third knowledge?

**Speaker A:** The third knowledge is the doubt about what we're doing here. Okay. And it's stated in the suttas as knowledge and vision of what is and what is not the path. What is the path is just relax and let go. What is not the path is trying to fix stuff. Now we can get more technical in the sense of the knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path is actually the Eightfold Noble Path of being able to remember to look, to see, and to let it, to fix it, to change it, to take the effort. It's not a letting go because the letting go phrase has passivity built into it. And we're not passive, we're actively stopping it. It's not a matter of just taking your foot off the gas, it's actually putting the brakes on. Because you can let your foot off the gas and going downhill, and the truck's still going to just continue careening down the hill. You gotta be actively put the brakes on.

**Speaker B:** There it's a— I mentioned, or I came up with this thought right now, that like, like singing a lullaby that everything is good and everything is fine, constantly doing this.

**Speaker A:** Yes, sing yourself a lullaby. The other way of talking about it is nurturing as opposed to critical, because the critical thoughts are actually a critical parent. Critical in the sense of not conforming to the standards, not living up to the rules. Not doing what you were told to do. Okay, and so that's the rules, that's the standards, that's the rituals, that's the way things are supposed to be done. And then we have conflict with that. The right way to do it is just nothing. Just put the brakes on, stop that argument inside, stop all of those unwholesome thoughts. Yeah, and the way to do that is by having nurturing thoughts. Everything is okay, everything is fine.

**Speaker B:** And these nurturing thoughts is just telling me it's good, it's fine, it's everything is all right, and it will always.

**Speaker A:** Be all right, and it's always been all right, and I didn't know it.

**Speaker B:** And so this— so I imagine that this eventually turns into like a habit that happens more.

**Speaker A:** This is a brand new habit that we're forming. The old habits is, I got— it's broken, I got to fix it. And the new habit is, it's already okay, this is good.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And then everything that you do becomes a toy to play with. As opposed to a job that's got to be done.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. It's so opposing to maybe, um, other methods or other teachings I've listened to, because that's always— you have to put effort in in the beginning to somehow get any value later.

**Speaker A:** But I feel like with— right, so the right effort then is that, yes, you do have to put some effort in, but the effort is putting the brakes on, not getting faster.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but I feel like this, what you teach or what you taught me, is it gives me like immediate results. Like I can see it, feel it, be it like right now, and I don't have to do efforts to rely on something I will get later. And I can have this right now.

**Speaker A:** But as you do that, the skills will be developed.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So satisfaction is kind of a skill to be developed. You start off in satisfaction, but as you develop the skill, that skill of satisfaction turns into really deep satisfaction. Wow, this is really okay. So basically the skill adds that wow factor. Wow, things are already okay. Wow, I don't have to do anything. Wow, I have arrived.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. Um, I've been re-listening to our, um, to our talk that we had, our first talk, and you've been talking about this, uh, Dukkha, Nirodha. And I was— you just explained to me what Dukkha means, and I was just wondering what is dissatisfaction? Right. And what is Nirodha? What does this mean?

**Speaker A:** Well, that means the stopping of the dissatisfaction. So satisfaction is the exact opposite of dissatisfaction. In the Pali language, the word Sukkha is the exact opposite of the word Dukkha. So we want to cultivate Sukkha. All right. What are the components of Sukkha? Feeling safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. We do that over and over again, and then the next component is that wow factor, is the feeling of success. Safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. You practice that over and over and over again, and then we will add the ingredient of success. Wow, I can handle it by doing nothing at all. Wow, already Wow, I don't get uptight anymore. Wow, I don't get angry much. Everything's going my way. Why? Because my way is the reality way.

**Speaker B:** So Nirodha is just letting go of the Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's the exact opposite of Dukkha. Dukkha, Nirodha. Is the same as Sukkha, which has to be developed. Because you have been developing Dukkha, you have been developing dissatisfaction.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So we have to actually develop being satisfied.

**Speaker B:** Right. I've been searching, like you said, I've been searching all the wrong places to get rid of the Dukkha. And I've There was this, I think it was like a story, that when you get hit by an arrow and it creates pain, and then you can just, yeah, you can be like saying to yourself, I hate that this arrow hit me, or I'm dissatisfied because this arrow hit me, but then you just shoot another invisible arrow at you And you suffer again, and then you can say yourself, oh shit, I again shot this arrow at me, and you shoot yourself another arrow and suffer again like this, right? It's over and over.

**Speaker A:** The two-arrow method, the Buddha talks about it in the sense of just one arrow. And here's the way he talks about it. This is actually, I think it's in Sutra number 64 in the Anagami Nikaya, is that When you get hit by the arrow, is this— sorry, your friends will go and get a doctor, and the doctor's job is to remove the arrow. But when the doctor comes, we start asking, who shot me? What kind of bow was it? What kind of arrow was it? Where was he standing when he shot it? Who made that arrow? Okay, this is the— so if we try to figure out why we got hit, then we just keep it going. We keep that arrow. All we need to do is to take the right effort to pull that thing out. And when our skill gets developed, we pull it out of thin air, not when it's already stuck in us. So that arrow is coming, we say, got it.

**Speaker B:** And what, what are these sutras you're talking about? Is this like the, the true teachings of the Buddha?

**Speaker A:** Yes, the Majjhima Nikaya was done at a conference, the first big meeting that was held starting at about 3 months after the Buddha's death and lasted for about a year. And that's where the Majjhima Nikaya comes from. There was some older writings, and then there's a whole, whole huge library full of stuff that's come since then. Yeah, but basically all we need is kind of two books. One is the Majjhima Nikaya, and then the other book would be the Sutta Nipata and the Udana, which were the original stuff, so that we can see where and how the teaching of the Buddha developed over the years. But the Eightfold Noble Path and the Four Noble Truths were part of the original teaching. And so, uh, yeah, I mean, the amount of Buddhist literature is vast. Yeah, but you don't need that. All you really need to do is to recognize you don't need to do all that reading. You can just be happy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've learned this with when I came across Zen. Because before that, I was raised Christian, so for me it was, it used to be always the Bible, so I have to read this big thing. And then it's some, sometime came to like Hinduism and it was like the Bhagavad Gita or something like this. And it's Zen, it was the first time where they just say, okay, there's, there's no book, there's no like holy, holy book that you need.

**Speaker A:** The only book you need to read is the book between your ears.

**Speaker B:** Right, right, right. This is great. This is great. And I really felt this when I came across it, that it took a lift from me. Because I always felt like, yeah, I have to do something to get to it. I have to do something, but I'm not quite there. And this was— Right.

**Speaker A:** And the funny part of it is, is what we have to do is to stop. Yeah, not go this and then do that and all— you're missing something, you got to go do it over there. No, that's the, the normal ordinary method. That's the way that people normally think, that I'm missing something here and I got to go do something. No, I'm missing something here, so let me stop all the stuff that is giving me the feeling that something is missing.

**Speaker B:** Right, right, right. But you have to come across it. You don't think, or I didn't think that way at all. But when I first came across what you said, it made so much sense. It makes so much sense. It is so simple, but you have to understand that it's simple. Yeah, and I feel like, well, I don't know, maybe they are like the Buddha discovered this, but it's not something, it's not, it's not the religion, or maybe even I imagine there can be other people that discover it also without coming ever across the teachings of the Buddha.

**Speaker A:** Those people are so very rare. You could make— you could name a few, like Diogenes and Socrates, Marcus Aurelius. Um, maybe put Jesus in that class. And then you have modern people like, um, uh, Eckhart Tolle.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** I've read— because he was so disappointed and he was so unhappy that he just decided to do nothing. He just sat on a park bench and London at the front of the Thames and just sat there for a couple of years until all of his wants and desires kind of melted away.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but it's interesting that I, I read, uh, his— I think it's his most famous book. And I think when I, like, when I think about it right now, he's teaching the same thing, but when I read his book, I did not understand it. But now that you tell me, or told me about Buddhism, I feel like I, I understand it on another level.

**Speaker A:** Good. So all you have to do now is remember, when those unwholesome thoughts come, just throw them out. Take the right effort to squash them, change them. Aha, I see you, unwholesome thought, is what the Buddha used, is aha, I see you, because that phrase is actually a change. Mostly when we see the hindrance, we'll say, oh, poor me. Oh, I forgot to practice, you know, that kind of stuff. And then the real practice is, aha, I see that.

**Speaker B:** And I also don't identify.

**Speaker A:** I make my own misery.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And I also don't identify with it anymore.

**Speaker A:** Not mine.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** It's just a process.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** A habit, not my habit, just a habit.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, yes, yes. I heard that you had another call. I would just maybe then wrap it up today. Thanks for it.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, we'll see you later. You just keep practicing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, for sure, I will, I will. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Okay, we'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** One quick question: what is the— why the hands? Why this?

**Speaker A:** It was an old habit from the time of the Buddha. Basically, it's the same as the handshake that we do in Western culture to show that you're empty-handed. Well, the hands are empty.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. All right then, thank you very much.

**Speaker A:** All right, we'll see you.

**Speaker B:** Have a great day.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) in dialogue with a Sangha friend (Speaker B), centers on a radical and counter-intuitive core teaching: **the end of suffering (Dukkha) is found not by acquiring, achieving, or fixing, but by stopping, relaxing, and recognizing that everything is already "good enough."**

Here is a summary of the key points:

### Core Problem: The Habit of Seeking
The practitioner describes a common feeling of being stuck in "not good enough," always seeking something better in the future or elsewhere. Dhammarato identifies this seeking itself as the primary hindrance to peace.

### The Solution: Stop and See It's Already Okay
*   **Recognize Hindrances:** Thoughts like "something could be better" are lies and hindrances. They obstruct the direct seeing that **everything is already okay** in this moment.
*   **Stop Searching:** The act of searching for okayness, relaxation, or peace is the very thing that prevents it. "There's nothing to search for."
*   **Relax the Mind, Not Just the Body:** Relaxation is a state of mind—a cessation of mental "doing" and evaluating (e.g., "Am I relaxed enough?").

### Key Insights and Practices
1.  **End the Pilgrimage:** The spiritual seeker is likened to a perpetual pilgrim, never satisfied upon reaching a holy site. **Enlightenment is realizing you have already arrived.** Stop trying to make "progress," as that implies the present is deficient.
2.  **Noble Right Effort is Stopping Wrong Effort:** It is not about straining for a goal. It is the active effort to **put the brakes on** unwholesome thoughts, judgments, and the inner drive to fix things. It's a shift from "doing" to "stopping."
3.  **Play with Hindrances, Don't Fight Them:** Anxiety, boredom, or other difficult states should not be seen as problems to eradicate. See them as "toys" to observe with curiosity. When you accept "it's okay to have anxiety," its power dissolves.
4.  **Cultivate Nurturing Thoughts:** Replace the critical inner voice (the "parent" with endless rules) with a nurturing one. Gently repeat lullabies to the mind: **"Everything is okay. Everything is fine. This is good enough."** This develops a new habit of satisfaction (Sukkha).
5.  **The Two Knowledges (Vipassanā & Samatha):**
    *   **First (Vipassanā):** Confidence that no matter how obstructed the mind gets, you can clear it and see reality clearly.
    *   **Second (Samatha):** The deep relaxation and satisfaction that comes from knowing you can handle anything by letting it be. This leads to the end of inner conflict between "shoulds" (parent) and "wants" (child).
6.  **The Adult State:** Move from the internal war between the critical parent (rules) and the reactive child (feelings) into the **"adult" state**—simply observing things as they are, without judgment or the need to change them.

### Underlying Philosophy
*   **Dukkha & Nirodha:** Dissatisfaction (Dukkha) is created by wanting things to be other than they are. Its cessation (Nirodha) is the cultivation of satisfaction (Sukkha)—feeling safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied with the ever-changing flow of reality.
*   **Non-Identification:** Unwholesome thoughts and feelings are seen as impersonal processes or habits—"not me, not mine." The concept of a solid "observer" self dissolves into mere observation.
*   **Simplicity of the Path:** The teaching is stripped of complex doctrine. The only "book" you need is your own mind. The path is not about acquiring knowledge but **unlearning the habit of dissatisfaction.**

### Conclusion
Dhammarato's guidance points toward an immediate, non-striving practice. Peace is not a future reward for effort but the natural state revealed when we **stop all the mental activities that obscure it**—seeking, judging, fixing, and believing the thought that "this is not enough." The ultimate skill to develop is the continuous return to the recognition: **"I am already here. This is already good enough."**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Speaker A) uses several core metaphors and references a few key stories to illustrate the teachings. Here are the main ones:

### **Core Metaphors:**

1.  **The Hindrance:** This is the central metaphor. Unhelpful thoughts (wanting something else, judging the present as "not good enough," anxiety, boredom) are repeatedly labeled as **"hindrances."** They are obstacles blocking the view of a reality that is already "okay" or "good enough." They are like clouds obscuring the sun.

2.  **The Pilgrim / The Permanent Resident:** This is a powerful extended metaphor for the mindset shift required.
    *   **The Pilgrim:** Represents the seeking mind, always in "progress," believing the holy site or satisfaction is somewhere else. The pilgrim's habit is to never arrive.
    *   **The Permanent Resident:** Represents the enlightened mind that recognizes it is already at the "holy site." The goal is to **"stop being a pilgrim and start being a permanent resident"**—to stop seeking and realize you have already arrived.

3.  **The Toy:** Negative mental states like anxiety are to be treated as **"a new toy to play with."** Instead of seeing them as threats that require action (fixing, fleeing), you can observe them with curiosity and detachment. This playful engagement ("Let me play with that") dissolves their power.

4.  **Putting the Brakes On (vs. Letting Go):** Right Effort is clarified with this metaphor. It's not passive "letting go" (taking your foot off the gas), which can leave you coasting on old momentum. It is **actively "putting the brakes on"** unwholesome thoughts and habits.

5.  **The Two Arrows / The Doctor and the Arrow:** This classic Buddhist metaphor is referenced.
    *   **The First Arrow:** The initial pain or unpleasant event (e.g., physical pain, a loss, boredom).
    *   **The Second Arrow:** The self-created suffering we add by our resistance—our stories, judgments, and "why me?" questions about the first arrow. The practice is to stop shooting the second arrow. Speaker A extends it by saying a skilled practitioner can "pull it out of thin air" before it even strikes.

6.  **The Parent, Adult, and Child (from Transactional Analysis):** This psychological model is used to describe internal conflict.
    *   **The Parent:** The internalized rules, "shoulds," and standards ("you ought to").
    *   **The Child:** The desires, feelings, and wants ("I don't want to").
    *   **The Adult:** The desired state of simply observing reality as it is, without the internal war between Parent and Child. The path is moving into the "adult in the room."

7.  **The Lullaby / Nurturing Thoughts:** The antidote to the critical inner "parent" is to **"sing yourself a lullaby"** of nurturing thoughts: "Everything is okay. Everything is fine. It's always been alright." This is the new habit that replaces the old one of problem-solving.

### **Stories and References:**

1.  **Adam and Eve:** Referenced briefly to illustrate how **judgment destroys paradise**. By judging things as good/bad, right/wrong, we fall from the innate "okayness" of the present moment.

2.  ***The Pilgrim's Progress*:** Referenced directly to illustrate the futile, habitual nature of seeking. The story underscores the metaphor of the perpetual pilgrim who never rests in the holy site because they believe a better one lies ahead.

3.  **Eckhart Tolle's Story:** Mentioned as a modern example of someone who discovered the principle by **"deciding to do nothing"**—sitting on a park bench until his wants melted away, embodying the "stop searching" teaching.

4.  **The Scientist:** Speaker B introduces the metaphor of the **"scientist mind"** that constantly experiments, tests, and evaluates. Speaker A reframes this, saying the Buddha's teaching is *truly* scientific because it is about **"just looking to see how it is"** without the judgment of "it's not good enough."

5.  **Hindu Trinity (Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva):** Briefly referenced to make a point about constant change. The core idea taken is that creation, maintenance, and destruction are always happening, and the key is to be satisfied with that changing nature rather than resisting it.

**In summary,** the talk uses metaphors of **obstacles (hindrances), journeys (pilgrim/resident), and tools (toys, brakes, lullabies)** to convey a central message: suffering is created by the mind's seeking and judging. Peace is found not by acquiring anything, but by stopping that mental activity and recognizing the present moment as already complete. The stories of Adam and Eve and the Pilgrim provide cultural and literary anchors for this idea.
