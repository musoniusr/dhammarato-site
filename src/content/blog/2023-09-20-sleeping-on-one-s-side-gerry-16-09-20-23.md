### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Turn it off a wee bit later.

**Speaker B:** Okay, that'll be all right, but I'll tell you when. Okay, so you're asking a question about the concept of sleeping on one side. Yes, this comes from the Buddha directly. It has a lot of practicality to it even today, but in the old days of the Buddha when you're sleeping on a hard surface like the ground, that that's the most comfortable way to do it, right? That in fact, one of the reasons why we go for soft mattresses is because we don't know how to lay down. And possibly the worst case is the hospital bed. Where people are intentionally required to sleep on their backs. And that it's quite probable, though I have no direct evidence— I'm sure that they don't want the evidence— that the medical profession were killing a whole lot of people during COVID because of that. That in fact, they were putting them on ventilators, which required for them to be on their backs. And that we can't breathe well in the lower part of the breathing area of the body. The lungs are pressed. If we're laying on our backs, then all of those kidneys and all of that stuff presses up on the lungs and prevents us from being able to get good breathing. If we lay on our stomach, the exact same thing happens. Now we're laying on our chest. But if we lay on our side, either on the left side or the right side, then we actually can improve both circulation and breathing. So it's got some scientific background to it. That in fact, that's one of the things that they started doing for people who had COVID was to lay them on their sides. We can also eliminate all of the phlegm and all of the stuff that comes up from the breathing that will settle into the bottom of the lungs if we're sleeping on the back. But if we sleep on the side, that stuff can come up a lot easier. So it has to do with health. It has to do with comfort. And it has to do with awareness in the sense of Westerners who have not been practicing that. We can learn to lay on our sides by remembering to. This is the point of Sati, is to start practicing laying on the side in the sense that that's the only way to do it. So you begin to recognize that when you're laying on your back, either on the floor or in bed or whatever, that it really is not as comfortable as if you would turn on your side. And not only that, but you've got two sides that you can alternate back and forth with so that there's not one posture that we get stuck into, to where that's also true with laying on one's back that we get kind of stuck in that kind of posture. And that if you see any advertisements for beds, you see movies and sitcoms and everything like that, and everybody is laying on their back. And so it's basically part of our culture. And that the only way that we can actually get away with it is because we've got soft, comfortable mattresses. That if you don't have a mattress, it becomes really uncomfortable to lay on the back.

**Speaker A:** Well, you still have, of course, if you're laying on your side and you don't have a mattress, I mean, if you're laying on the ground, you're really going to have to scoop out a wee bit for your hip, aren't you? Scoop out a bit of ground, a bit of the earth.

**Speaker B:** Well, just like dogs do when they lay in their favorite place on the ground, they kind of, with their hips, kind of dig it out.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. No, I asked this because, because, well, because you had mentioned it as being something taught to monks. I mean, I've been sleeping on my side all my life. Just by preference, I sleep on my side. And I think I always have, but that's Anicca.

**Speaker B:** There's actually a whole lot of statuary throughout Asia and a lot of photos. The term is the reclining Buddha, and it always shows him on his side.

**Speaker A:** But what's he using to prop his head up?

**Speaker B:** Well, there is a whole lot of options for that. Some of them are austere. One is that you can lay with your head on your arm. Another one is that you can use many different things for the pillow, including the sanghati robe. And that in Thailand, they have triangular-shaped, three-cornered pillows. That are used. Um, and so, uh, at Wat Soan Mokkh, by the way— and this is the only place that I know that they do that, and I have an idea that the reason that they do it is because the animals will eat kapok, cotton, and all of that kind of stuff, but they are less likely to eat wood. And so the pillows that are generally laying around Wat Soan Mokkh are wooden pillows, and people can in fact get used to sleeping on them. Some even find that they're even more comfortable because a cotton pillow or a normal kind of pillow, a foam pillow, will get hot, it gets lumpy, it has all kinds of problems. And people think that all buying something is the solution to that. And so they'll buy an expensive pillow rather than recognizing that no pillows are not the solution necessarily to the problem, that getting the head at the right angle and that often pillows have the head propped up too high. So when you're sleeping on your left side, your head is this way. Yeah, and, and so if you get the head to where it's a normal kind of state, like we— like it is when we're standing up, that most people don't live their lives with their head cocked way over like that. And so, uh, they tend to get headache or neck aches and whatnot because of the pillows that they have. So a smaller pillow would be the right way to go, or having cloth like the sanghati robe. They can use that as a sitting cushion, and then they can use it as a tent, they can use it as a pillow, they can use it for all kinds of things. Sometimes you want both of them at the same time, both a tent and a pillow. But at least you have a choice. So this is the whole idea about sleeping on one side is for health, for comfort, and for mindfulness. Now, since you've been doing it your whole life, you probably would only slightly understand that many people in the West have trouble with doing that. They wake up in the middle of the night if they're remembering to and recognize that the body is out of posture and they'll get back into posture. And sometimes we don't even have to wake up, that throughout the night we will adjust the body's posture and it's generally better because we're looking for comfort. And so people get restless because they're sleeping on their stomach or sleeping on their back and rolling over to where they would maintain their comfort for a longer time if they would sleep on their side. And remembering that and getting into that posture intentionally is part of the practice.

**Speaker A:** Indeed, you see in— well, I saw in I have a photograph. It's one of the major temples in Bangkok that one goes to look at when one goes to Bangkok because one doesn't know anything about them, or one did. And there is this huge reclining Buddha. You will know which one it is.

**Speaker B:** The huge one is at Wat Pho. It's not the only huge one, but that's a big one. It was actually restored in the past few years. It had gotten pretty dirty in there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, he seems, he seems in that position to, to, to have his elbow down and to be lying like that. And I mean, I'm thinking that cannot be comfortable because you try it, it's, it's, it's not at all comfortable holding.

**Speaker B:** Your head up because where the angle of— depends upon the angle of the elbow. And perhaps the, the, the, the draw— the, the statuary is, uh, indicating that is at the wrong angle.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway, anyway, I thought, I thought, what's he doing like that? He can't have been very comfortable doing that. Anyway, there we are. That's, that's a small question that just intrigued me as to, you know, as to why it should be that, that they tell monks to do that. Now, yeah, I want to— I just want to switch off. I'm going to switch off the recording now.

**Speaker B:** Okay.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points discussed between Dhammarato (Speaker B) and a Sangha friend (Speaker A):

**Core Topic:** The Buddha's instruction for monks to sleep on their side, its practical benefits, and cultural context.

**Main Points Explained by Dhammarato:**

1.  **Health & Practicality:** Sleeping on the side (left or right) is historically practical for sleeping on hard surfaces and has significant health benefits:
    *   **Improved Breathing & Circulation:** Lying on the back or stomach compresses the lungs. Side-sleeping allows for better lung expansion and circulation, a point made relevant by mentioning its use for COVID-19 patients on ventilators.
    *   **Clears Phlegm:** Prevents fluid from settling in the bottom of the lungs, allowing it to drain more easily.

2.  **Awareness (Sati) & Comfort:** The practice is linked to mindfulness. Intentionally choosing to sleep on the side involves noticing discomfort in other postures (back, stomach) and adjusting for greater comfort. Alternating sides prevents stiffness. Dhammarato suggests Western culture, with its soft mattresses and media portrayals, has normalized back-sleeping, making side-sleeping a conscious practice.

3.  **Practical Tips & Examples:**
    *   **Pillows:** Discusses alternatives to modern pillows, which can cause neck strain. Mentions using the arm, the sanghati robe, traditional triangular Thai pillows, or even wooden pillows (as at Wat Suan Mokkh) for proper head alignment.
    *   **Posture Adjustment:** Part of the practice is waking up or subconsciously adjusting during the night to return to the side-sleeping posture for sustained comfort.

**Supporting Context from the Dialogue:**
*   **Cultural Reference:** The "reclining Buddha" statues throughout Asia always depict the Buddha lying on his side.
*   **Dialogue Tidbits:** Speaker A notes they've always slept on their side by preference. Both speakers briefly discuss and question the comfort of the specific elbow-propped head position seen in some reclining Buddha statues (like the large one at Wat Pho in Bangkok), concluding the artistic angle may not be practically comfortable.

**Overall Theme:** The instruction is presented not as an austere rule, but as a wise, embodied practice combining health, comfort, and mindful attention to one's posture.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, the primary **metaphor** and recurring **story** are:

**1. The "Reclining Buddha" as a Metaphor for Ideal Posture and Mindfulness**
   * The image of the reclining Buddha (specifically mentioned at Wat Pho in Bangkok) is used as a cultural and spiritual story that embodies the correct way to sleep: on one's side.
   * This statue isn't just art; it serves as a **metaphor for health, comfort, and intentional awareness** in rest. It represents a teaching from the Buddha that is both practical and symbolic.

**2. The Hospital Bed / COVID-19 Ventilator Story**
   * Speaker B tells a **cautionary story** about modern medical practice, suggesting that forcing patients to lie on their backs (especially on ventilators during COVID) might have been harmful.
   * This story serves as a **contrasting metaphor** for cultural ignorance. It frames the back-sleeping posture as a dangerous, institutionalized norm, opposed to the wiser, natural side-sleeping posture.

**3. The "Soft Mattress" as a Metaphor for Cultural Cushioning**
   * Soft mattresses are presented as a **metaphor for how modern comfort enables poor habits**. They allow people to sleep in an unnatural position (on the back) without immediate discomfort, masking the underlying problem.
   * The talk implies that without this "cushion," we would naturally seek the more comfortable and healthy side posture, just as one would on the hard ground.

**4. The Animal Metaphor (Dogs)**
   * When discussing sleeping on hard ground, Speaker A mentions having to "scoop out a wee bit for your hip." Speaker B extends this into a **simple, natural metaphor**: "just like dogs do."
   * This metaphor connects the practice to an instinctual, pre-cultural wisdom, reinforcing that side-sleeping is natural and embodied by animals.

**5. The Monk's Robe (Sanghati) and Wooden Pillow as Metaphors for Versatility and Simplicity**
   * The monk's robe, which can be used as a sitting cushion, tent, or pillow, is a **metaphor for multifunctional, mindful living**—the opposite of consumer culture where we buy a specialized product for every need.
   * The story of the **wooden pillows at Wat Soan Mokkh** (used because animals won't eat them) extends this. It's a metaphor for finding comfort in simplicity and durability, challenging the assumption that expensive, specialized commodities (like foam pillows) are the solution.

**6. The "Advertisements and Sitcoms" Story as a Metaphor for Cultural Programming**
   * Speaker B points out that in all media, people are shown sleeping on their backs. This is a brief **story about cultural indoctrination**. It acts as a metaphor for how we unconsciously absorb and replicate norms that may not be in our best interest.

**In summary**, the talk uses:
*   **The central story/metaphor** of the Reclining Buddha to anchor the teaching.
*   **Modern cautionary tales** (hospital beds, advertising) as metaphors for misguided cultural norms.
*   **Simple, natural metaphors** (dogs digging, wooden pillows) to advocate for returning to instinctual wisdom and mindful simplicity.
