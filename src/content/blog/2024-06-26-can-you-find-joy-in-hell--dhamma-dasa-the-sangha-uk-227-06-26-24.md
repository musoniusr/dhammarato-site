### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Started recording, by the way, just so you know.

**Speaker B:** Oh, just now?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Nice. That's okay. Yeah, that's fine.

**Speaker A:** Sometimes they use them, sometimes they don't. What was the drama about?

**Speaker B:** I don't want to get into it, but you know, there's hard days where we don't feel as much Dhamma or the fruits of Dharma. And it's harder to navigate, especially things like sickness or like mental problems. I hope Dhammarato is doing all right with the low energy. Even if you have low energy, it could be hard to practice, it could be hard to embody the Dharma.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Buddha Dasubhikkhu used to say when we're sick, when things are falling apart, That's the best time to practice. Because anybody can feel good when things are going well, you know. If it doesn't— Yūji Krishnamurti used to say, "If it doesn't work in traffic, then what's the point?" Anybody can be peaceful on a mountaintop.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. That's a good one.

**Speaker A:** Can you be peaceful in hell? Can you find joy in hell? That's a good question. And that's why, that's why the books, the books are nice, but the books won't always help you. Even the teachers won't always help you, you know. It's It's like if you're a bike racer or a car racer, you can get a fancy uniform like a monk. You can study all the mechanics and know everything about your car like the scholars. You can have the best car, the best vehicle, like being in the best surrounding conditions, like going to a a lot in Thailand or whatever. You can have all that stuff, but in racing it doesn't matter. Are you going fast? Are you relaxed behind the wheel? Are you winning the race? In racing, that's what matters. They don't give a fuck what you look like or what your credentials are, like Western society is obsessed with. Can you run a good race? Can you do well in the race? And in the Dharma, it's can you find joy in gladdening the mind here and now? Who cares if you're the King of France, or if you have a doctorate, or if you're a monk in some temple with the biggest prayer beads? Can you find peace right where you are, right where you sit? And we only have to ask ourselves the question. Nobody's going to answer it for us. Nobody's going to go in our head and say, "Oh, you're suffering. Let's find the correct way to practice and be happy." You really have to do some self-investigation. Such a cute kitty. I love cats, man.

**Speaker B:** It's interesting what you said about race and race car drivers, how they have to go fast and be relaxed behind the wheel.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and go the distance while they're going fast. And it's just an analogy, it's not perfect, but a lot of times in the Dharma people get obsessed with the studying with the memorization, with the different vocabulary words, with the robes, with the necklaces, with the rituals, with the how long have you been practicing, how long this, how long that. But sometimes, well, damn near almost every time, a lot of beginning students, they just never quite understand that all that shit, it's not that it's good or bad, it just doesn't do anything for you with gladdening your mind. Unless you allow it to. But if you think, oh, I know all the words, oh, I studied the most, oh, I'm a monk in a monastery, and you think that's going to do anything for you, if you're depending on that, then you're just fooling yourself. We really have to ask ourselves day by day, these things happen to me that I can't control and they piss me off, they get me angry, they get me frustrated. Why am I practicing the Dhamma? What is all of this for? Those are the real questions. What the fuck are we doing? If we're just going to sit here and suck each other's dicks, we're just pissing in the wind. You know what I mean? Why are we doing this? We're doing this because we want to find peace. We want satisfaction. And when we have calls like this, it's a reminder of the simple things. The remembering Sati. Remember to look and change. That's the whole Eightfold Noble Path. That Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha is the point of all this. There's dukkha in this world, and there's a way out of it. And that's all that there is. The Buddha said, both formally and now, I teach one thing and one thing only: Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Everything else is bullshit. Everything else, you're just kidding yourself. That's what the whole Pali Canon is, is just don't worry, be happy. But students don't want to hear that. Students have the Western mentality, especially in the West, of course. They want to run the race, they want to climb the mountain, they want to be the best student, they want all this bullshit, and they spend a lifetime trying to get it. But ironically, if they put all that shit down, all that craving, all that desire, then the Kingdom of Heaven would unfold right here, right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there's a trap because learning some theory and some of the words like Sati can be beneficial, and you, you know, want to know what other people mean when they say it. Of course, bogged down with theory and distracted Um, yeah, so it's hard.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, in that regard, just, just like our, just like our analogy, a fast race car sure will help you. A fancy fireproof uniform sure will make you feel good. But if you're driving your car into a fucking brick wall, what difference does it make that you know what kind of car you're destroying? You know the ins and outs of everything to do with that car that you're driving into a wall. So I'd rather have a guy on a lawnmower keeping it on the road rather than having everything that is the best of the best and driving it into a wall. I know what Sati means, I know what this— yes, but can you practice it? Can you drive? And sure, basic knowledge, this— I'm not against the uniforms, I'm not against the fancy race cars. But you've got to become a good driver. You have to learn how to drive.

**Speaker B:** Learn the basics first. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** The basics, and then master the basics.

**Speaker B:** Master the basics. And yeah, it's fair to say that most race car drivers have mastered the basics. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And some of them their arrogance have got them obsessed with the types of cars they drive, who sponsors them during the race, how their girlfriend is doing, getting the best motor, getting the best engine. It's not that they can't do well once in a while. And it's just an analogy. All analogies are flawed by their very nature. So just take it with a grain of salt. It's not the end-all be-all.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** The point of the analogy is don't rely on bullshit things that don't matter. Rely on things that do matter. And the things that do matter is that the Buddha told us we can't, we have the power to change our mind here and now. Everything's okay here and now. Everybody talks about the Dhamma, the Dhamma, this, the Dhamma, that. Anagami, this, Anagami that. Very few people understand what the Dhamma is. Their minds are off in the future, off in the present, distracted by something, back in the past, attached to a label, attached to a word, attached to wanting to be the best Buddhist, attached to wanting to get it right. Dhammarato would always say, you don't have to get it right, just have to get it happily. Yeah, yeah, that is getting it right. When you have a carefree, light attitude and you're not attached to anything.

**Speaker B:** Um, if one were to explain the Dharma to, uh, I don't know, a teenager What would be the best way to do it? Just like you did then?

**Speaker A:** Oh, like you said earlier, just lead by example.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** When they make a mistake, don't be so hard on them. Be forgiving. When they come to you for advice, use wisdom instead of ignorance. And just be joyful. You know, have a joyful, lighthearted attitude with them. Show them that they can change the things in their mind. They don't have to be a slave to the mind. They could be a friend to the mind. They could help guide it. You know, why do we all— I always say this— why do we all like our grandmas and grandfathers? Nobody's ever liked their grandma and grandpa because when they were around them, they were anxious assholes. You like your grandma and grandpa. Why? Because they had the energy of just loving kindness. They didn't know Buddhism. They didn't know the Dhamma, most of them. But most of them knew that they just loved you and they had a carefree attitude around you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that's the Dhamma. They know nothing of Buddha. They know nothing of India or Tibet. They know nothing of Thailand. But they just knew how to love you. And those are some of the most important people in our lives if we're lucky.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Why? Because they didn't judge us. They didn't try to control us. They just loved us. There's a freedom that comes when the Dhamma is practiced correctly. The freedom of letting go of all this bullshit. The freedom of realizing Everything's okay right here, right now. There's nothing that needs to be done. Just this breath is enough. Just this breathing right here is fine. And the reason we have Dhamma talks like this is because we're practicing Sati, we're practicing the Eightfold Path. We're reminding ourselves, oh yeah, I don't have to be a slave to this bullshit. I don't have to let Dukkha control me. I can just let it all go. You know, I love Ajahn Chah's example of the water buffalo. He's trying to keep it on the road, but the buffalo wants to go to the left, it wants to go to the right and eat the vegetables and trample the rice garden. And he says that's like the mind. The mind wants to get involved in our thoughts, feelings, and emotions. Oh good. All right, peace. Love you. Give me one. Yeah, yeah, no problem. You come in here? Is he coming here to play? Oh good.

**Speaker B:** I wonder if I set up this mic so you can hear me better.

**Speaker A:** I hear you fine, but whatever you want to do. I will never stop somebody from enhancing their audio.

**Speaker B:** Hello.

**Speaker A:** Oh, that's nice.

**Speaker B:** Can you hear me just the same?

**Speaker A:** No, it sounds slightly better, but I could be mistaken, but it sounds slightly better.

**Speaker B:** Oh, good. All right, yeah, if it sounds better, it sounds better. Nice. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But that analogy of the water buffaloes like our mind— Ajahn Chah would say if the buffalo goes to the left or to the right off the road, it wants to trample the rice paddies, it wants to eat the vegetables from shopkeepers. And that's like our mind with thoughts, feelings, and emotions. And Ajahn Chah said it's a fun game, you'll never be bored because you'll always be able to play this game. Of not getting involved with what your mind's throwing at you. It's the water buffalo. When it goes too much to the left, if you're getting a little too angry, you have to practice Sati and hit it with the stick and say, "Ah, I see myself getting angry." Get back on the road, get back of letting go, get back of not desiring this bullshit that's making you angry. And then it goes towards the right of happiness. "Oh, I like this. I got this beautiful woman. Now I'm really on cloud nine." Wait a minute, practice our Sati, hit the stick on the buffalo. Get that mind back in the center of the road. Like, that stuff's not going to last. Remember, it's only going to lead to more Dukkha. And then you get back in the.

**Speaker B:** Middle of the road.

**Speaker A:** And it's a fun, constant game that you can always play that I never get tired of personally. Every day, every day, it's a fun, challenging game. Not difficult, but challenging in the fun way, you know.

**Speaker B:** That's a good attitude to have about it. There can be challenging days. There has been for me where it is a challenge. And maybe sometimes where I completely forget to do Dhamma practice, and I'm just like mired in illusion and suffering. Yeah. And I know further, the further you get along in the path, that happens like less likely or with less frequency, less intensity, less duration. But even like monks that have been doing it for like 40 years, you know, I've heard stories where like they wind up in the hospital and all of their meditation practice and ability to focus the mind, to hit it with a stick, it goes away. And that's why they're like, be grateful for when you can practice and you can hit it with a stick, because maybe at some point there will be no stick to hit it with.

**Speaker A:** Well, you're never going to free yourself from physical pain. It's inevitable. Death, sickness, aging, it's all inevitable. And if you're under the illusion that if you're an enlightened master, you're not going to feel pain, you're not going to go through some times that are a little more tougher than others, then you're deluding yourself. Even the Buddha on his deathbed had great stomach pain. He was complaining, but he also had the right attitude of seeing Mara, aka in this example, the pain. He said, oh yeah, and he was able to see it. It's not a magical— a lot of people, they fuck up with the Dharma because they put it in this magical realm of the Tibetan Buddhist yogis floating in the sky and all this magical bullshit. You can have peace even if you're on the verge of death. Even if you're suffering great physical pains. Pain is natural. Suffering is not natural. Suffering is created by man. It's a bunch of bullshit. You know?

**Speaker B:** You don't think there's anything natural about suffering?

**Speaker A:** It's a concept. All concepts are delusions, illusions. There's no suffering in reality. There's only a wrong ignorant perception of reality that turns it into Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** So you don't think Dukkha itself is a concept?

**Speaker A:** It's a concept, yeah. That's what I'm saying. It's only a concept. It can't hurt us. Everything is conceptual. Everything is a tool. You can use a shovel to dig a garden or to smack somebody over the head. It all depends on what you plan on doing with these tools. And Dukkha is just another tool. Dukkha could be your worst enemy or your best friend or your best teacher. But a lot of people don't see it as their best teacher who's like a silly Mara that comes around every.

**Speaker B:** Once in a while.

**Speaker A:** I see you, Mara. You're not going to get me this. A lot of people see it as the end-all be-all Satan of, oh, poor me, victim mentality bullshit. Because our culture showed us that being a victim is what we should do in all situations. Poor me, nobody has suffering like me, nobody understands the movie drama of my life. I'm beyond all my suffering. And it's all bullshit. Everybody has suffered, you know. What are you going to do about it? Are you going to play the victim about it? Are you going to change it? You can change it. It doesn't mean your life's going to be all sunshine and rainbows. Just like Jesus on the cross and all his disciples. He's an enlightened master and all of his disciples, some of them were enlightened masters, and they got skinned alive. They got crucified upside down. Even Christ himself was crucified. John the Baptist, his head got chopped off. It doesn't mean everything's just going to be wonderful in the physical realm, but it does mean everything's going to be wonderful in here, within. That's why they call it spirituality, because it's of the ethereal. It's not of the physical. Society is dependent on the physical to make themselves feel good. But what they call goodness is really just temporary sense pleasures that are fleeting and don't last and only cause more Dukkha. And what they call joy and happiness is just temporary sense pleasures that do exactly the same thing. It's both ends of the different snake. The head of the snake is what we all know is suffering, anger, hatred, delusion. But the tail end of the snake is the mundane, shallow versions of happiness and joy, which is really just temporary sense pleasures. And Ajahn Chah would say, just drop the whole snake of the mind altogether, and then this noble joy comes. And that's the Nibbana, that's the cooling of the mind where you're no longer being born, reborn, and dying into new thoughts, feelings, and emotions. You see them for what they are. You see them as Anicca, Dukkha, not impermanent, unsatisfactory by nature, and inherently empty of a permanent self. So why would you cling to any thought, feeling, and emotion? It's all going to come and go. This call will come and go. More people will come and go in the Sangha. Nobody really gives a fuck. Don't hold on to anything. Dhammarato, great teacher, he'll come and go. As we're seeing. Yeah, maybe then some assholes will take over. Maybe some great people, even better than Dhammarato, will take over. I don't know. The future is uncertain, and who gives a shit? Whatever happens, happens. It doesn't mean that we want bad things to happen. It doesn't mean that we're looking forward to— no, but we're prepared. Sure, we hope for the best, but we prepare for the worst.

**Speaker B:** And how does one maximize preparation? I get the joy and happiness part, but other than that, is that the only thing?

**Speaker A:** Just be satisfied with the way things are. The Western mindset is, okay, I have Nibbana, but I want the super Nibbana. Okay, I'm satisfied, but I want to be really satisfied. And Dhammarato taught us good enough is okay. Things are not going to be perfect, but they're going to be good enough. You may not have all the money in the world, but you have some. That's good enough. You may not have all the answers, but you have a couple answers. That's good enough. Can you be okay with the way things are? Is the question. Can you be satisfied not knowing? Can you be satisfied not getting it right and not being the best and not being perfect, not being the most attractive and not having things go your way, not getting the wife you want, not getting the children you want, not getting the husband you want, not getting the friends you want? Can you be satisfied? And it's either yes or no, you know. You could bang your head on the wall wishing things are different, it's not going to do anything.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think there's momentum. Like, if I've been practicing doing formal techniques and focusing the mind on an object with an awareness and bringing my attention back to that object, and on top of that I do Metta, or instill feelings of well-being in myself and others, and I look at the line between myself and others and see how thin it actually is. When I do all that, then when I do get sick and I'm sitting there throwing up with food poisoning or something, I'm like, it's not that bad. I can laugh at myself. And that's good enough. Other times I completely lose it. And yeah, and then it might take days for somebody else to hit me with a stick And that's what the song is for. Yeah, so basically get us out of our mud.

**Speaker A:** You're a human, you fuck up once in a while, big deal. Everybody— I fuck up, I fucked up the other day, I got angry as fuck.

**Speaker B:** So what?

**Speaker A:** Can you be okay with that?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Can you have compassion on yourself and say, oh yeah, I'm just a person, it's all right if I fuck up? It doesn't mean you want to fuck up. It doesn't mean that you're encouraging yourself to make an excuse to fuck up more in the future. But can you be okay that you're human and once in a while you're going to make mistakes? That's what being a human is about. If you were perfect, you'd be a fucking Buddha statue or a robot, not a human. Ajahn Chah used to say, you know, everybody wants to— they think they're the perfect Buddhist because they can sit and not be disturbed in the mind and just smile like a chicken. And he's like, you know, I've seen chickens who can roost for months on end. Are they enlightened? Are they enlightened beings? It doesn't mean anything. What being enlightened, what having Nibbana means, is can you be amongst the world? Can you think and feel and interact with other human beings and not be perfect and be okay with it? You know? Don't be so hard on yourself or take life so personally or seriously. It's no big deal. Give yourself a break.

**Speaker B:** Do you think that it's a good thing to have goals and maybe a little outcome dependency, or goals without outcome dependency. Like, yeah, I'll have the goal, and whether I reach it or not, I'll be okay. But just like to be prudent and imagine a future that you want and try to change the world for this, for that, because it's like not good enough, or it's perfection but you're perfecting perfection.

**Speaker A:** You're human, you want to have some goals and some things that humans do. There's nothing wrong with that. The Buddha had many goals and he achieved many of them, but he wasn't crushed if they didn't happen just the way he planned. He wasn't crushed if they didn't happen at all. He was perfectly fine whether they happened or not. He didn't give a fuck. So you want goals? Go ahead, but it's not— don't fool yourself. Don't think that once you achieve some goal, oh, that only then I'll be happy, then I'll be content. You have to have wisdom in your goal achieving.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, when you don't achieve your goal, don't beat yourself up.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Real laziness is not changing your Dukkha into Sukkha, not changing your dissatisfaction into satisfaction or joy. That's real laziness, and that's the only real goal we need. If you have other worldly goals like opening a school or becoming a certain thing in a career, there's nothing wrong with that whatsoever. We're human, that's what we do. We do all kinds of different shit. Some people become monks, some people become kings, some Some people become maintenance workers, whatever the fuck. It's all good. That's the beauty of the Dharma. It's not something that we have to strive for like everything else. It's available to us now. Because when we come back to the breath, that's why there is the emphasis on the breath that the Buddha showed us, is because when we have the breath, it frees us from this conceptual world that we're used to playing in all the time. And getting burned in all the time. When we come back to the breath, we realize, oh, actually we're all perfectly enlightened beings already. The only thing that will keep you from being enlightened is your Kamma, aka negative attachments and bad habits, your Samskaras. Kamma is not something mystical. Kamma is when you do something you know you shouldn't have done and then you feel guilty about it or you suffer the consequences of doing it. But now that we come back to the breath, we see that all of that's not really important or relevant. We're already free. Just don't create any more negative kamma for yourself by fucking everything up. Be kind to people. That's why Sila, morality, and Metta, acts of loving kindness and compassion, are such a wonderful guideline for Buddhists. Because when the Buddha realized, when you follow those things, God, you really have nothing to worry about. You know? Every choice, every interaction that you come across, if you practice Sila and Metta, What the hell could go wrong? You know, you don't think anything could go wrong, but what about this? What about that? That's for the ignorant people to argue amongst themselves what could have been done better. If the person in their heart is earnest and they're working from a place of Metta and Sila, you can't go wrong. You're an enlightened Buddha already. You know, you have a cool mind now. I can see it. You're just focusing on your breath. Thoughts, feelings, emotions are going to come. Just see them for what they are. They're just part of the body, natural chemical process. You don't have to fight them. You don't have to love them. You don't have to hate them. Just live with them. Can you live with them peacefully? Most people can. That's why I always say Nibbana is not some magical mystical thing. Being an Arahant is not some fucking some bullshit that these assholes created it to be. It just means you're chill. But they want to make it something that it's not. They want to make it greater. They want to have a competition. They want to go to Harvard. They want to go to the best wat. They want to be the best monk. And then they're playing around in the Dukkha realm again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. I would agree with you on that. And then I would also say that it's good to have categories.

**Speaker A:** Can be.

**Speaker B:** And, oh man, let me take care of my cats real quick. Hold on. I'll be right back. They want to go out.

**Speaker A:** Just chilling.

**Speaker B:** Come on, baby. All right, my bad about that.

**Speaker A:** Take your time, dude. Letting out your cats, tending to your cats is more important than anything we'll be talking about here. That's because that's actual Dhamma practice, is being peaceful and kind towards other living beings. That's the real practice. This is just talking.

**Speaker B:** True. I hope others may hear this, though they may get something out of it.

**Speaker A:** And maybe they will, maybe they won't.

**Speaker B:** Maybe I'll get something out of it. So there are some things with theory that I still don't understand. And I appreciate categories. And I appreciate Not having to be categorical too, but like, so the balance. Yeah, healthy balance. But yeah, there are these words which I don't understand, which would be interesting to understand because they're out there and maybe If there's the word pointing to a state of being or a state of consciousness like Srotapanna and a path that somebody in that category— excuse me— is like, yeah, I took this path and it really helped me get to this category, and somebody else is like, yeah, I took this path and it helped me get to that category, then then other people can decide, hey, let me try out those paths. Maybe they're for me, maybe they're not, but it sounds like a pretty interesting state of consciousness to be in. I'd like to give it a shot. And just that wholesome, I'll give it a go, see what happens. I think that's fine. I don't know, would you agree with that? And do you know what these categories are?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, they're just a bunch of bullshit. They're just another rabbit to chase like a dog, or a dog chasing his tail. Maybe if I get this right, maybe if I reach this level, then I'll become something really special. Because they can't be satisfied with the way things are. Ironically, when you don't want to be a Srotapanna, when you don't give a fuck about being an abbot of the monastery, when you don't give a fuck about being an Arhat, then you become one.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, yes, I understand that in my life with other regards too.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, when you're trying to get it right, where is your mind going? It's not going here, it's not going on the breath where everything's okay right here, right now. It's going into the character realm of the ego. I'm going to become something. No man— I heard Ajahn Samatha say this the other day— no man can become an Arahant. No man can become a Buddha. No person can become these things because it requires that person to disappear in order to become those things.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah. So.

**Speaker A:** You'Ll be chasing it your entire life.

**Speaker B:** Is there a part of you that is a man?

**Speaker A:** On some level, there's just a, yeah, I'm a human, I'm a man, but it's just concepts, you know, it's just.

**Speaker B:** Bullshit.

**Speaker A:** But I guess if I had to describe myself as something, sure, for the sake of getting to like Jyoti Krishnamurti, or J. Krishnamurti said, for the sake of getting to our trains on time, for the sake of these material things, sure, sure there is. But it's not a mystical, there's no self. There's just no permanent self that's really worthy of our attention.

**Speaker B:** No permanent self worthy of our attention.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Buddha Das Bhikkhu.

**Speaker B:** What you deem worthy is arbitrary.

**Speaker A:** Well, what you deem worthy is based on if it's going to bring more Dukkha or not. And the Buddha said, Anicca Dukkha Natta. Natta, no permanent self. It's a big thing that causes a lot of Dukkha. This idea of the ego, the idea of a permanent self. No mind, no problem. No ego, no problem. No person, no problem. But when the person's invented in the mind, oh, then I got to become a Srotapanna. Then I have to get to this Jhana and this Jhana. And then I have to do all this shit. And ain't I special, right? Ain't I the best?

**Speaker B:** Because that can be a toxic way of looking at it. That is.

**Speaker A:** Whenever you bring in too strongly a person, I, me, my, into any equation, you're getting yourself away from the moment. You're getting yourself away from gladdening the mind here and now. Because all of a sudden now I've taken off in the vessel of the ego and now I'm off to the future. I'm off to the past in my ego DeLorean.

**Speaker B:** Hmm. Yeah. So I know there's some people that claim that there are Arhats.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, they're called.

**Speaker B:** Assholes.

**Speaker A:** Delusional.

**Speaker B:** Assholes. That may be most of them. Than maybe most of them. I'm willing to be open-minded and say maybe there's one or two or many that are not delusional assholes.

**Speaker A:** Nope, 100% of them.

**Speaker B:** I don't like to be so—.

**Speaker A:** A lot of them, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Closed, closed-minded. I like to leave a little wiggle room, um, because maybe the Buddha— maybe, maybe it was only the Buddha, but.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, go ahead. Well, the reason you don't want to close that door is because then there won't be any cheese left to go find in the maze. You want the possibility that there's something else beyond this, because we can't be satisfied with what's right here, right now. There must be a magic perception. If maybe if I take ayahuasca, maybe if I do this, maybe if I go on this deprivation— and that's what the Buddha did. He was the best at it. His body would become emaciated to the point where you can see his ribs. Through the back of his body. He was the best. Nobody could suffer like the Buddha suffered. Yeah, but through all that he learned, oh, I'm fucking stupid.

**Speaker B:** I should have just found the middle path.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I should have just like been okay with the way things are instead of trying to bulldoze my way into happiness and some realm that doesn't exist.

**Speaker B:** Well, you think you could relax your way into Arhatship or middle path your way? Into it and just fall, and all of a sudden, hey, look at that. It seems like I don't have a desire. I don't have a desire to be an Arhat, but it seems possible that I could relax and middle path my way into it and then just look around and be like, oh yeah, if you say these are the categories, this is what it means to be an Arahant, and then I examine my life and I'm like, yeah, it seems like I have I checked all those boxes, I guess I am. I think that's fine.

**Speaker A:** If you can't find peace right where you are, right where you sit, you're not going to find it anywhere else. That's what Dogen Zenju said, and I agree with him. Where are you going to find it? If you can't find it here in your mind, you think it's on some other way, it's in some other path, it's in some other future, it's in some other— because when you look around your room now, you're like, well, I'm just a dude in a room. And part of you is not okay with that. Part of you looks at your life and says, I wish this was different. Maybe if I changed my perception, that would be— and then you're on the hunt to become a Srotapanna and all this shit.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it goes up and down. When I was just talking to you, looking around my room, I was perfectly fine and in peace the way things.

**Speaker A:** Are until we start thinking about things. Until we start contemplating.

**Speaker B:** Until some Samskara pops back up or some habit pattern. And yeah.

**Speaker A:** Let's play a game. Let's say your life will continue on the path it's been on at this moment. And you will live and die as this normal average dude who's moderately happy sometimes. Can you be okay with that?

**Speaker B:** I got this Puerto Rican music driving by.

**Speaker A:** Oh nice.

**Speaker B:** Can I be—.

**Speaker A:** Let'S assume nothing changes with your perception, nothing changes with your consciousness level of Sotapanna. Can you be happy with just this dude here who you are?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think many people can be happy.

**Speaker A:** And with the but always inevitably comes.

**Speaker B:** But I would like it. Yeah, I would like there to be— you can be at peace with what you are and be totally at peace in the present moment. And and in this moment and in that moment and in that moment and not need anything. And if you do that long enough, along with practice Sila, you know, trainings in morality and ethics, then maybe that's the category where you are an Arahant. If you're fine with what is and you're helping everybody out, may all sentient beings be happy.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's you. You just described yourself right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So congratulations, you're an Arahant. Feel any better? Feel any different?

**Speaker B:** I feel a little bit better. Yeah, it won't last.

**Speaker A:** That feeling won't last.

**Speaker B:** But did the Buddha categorize these things? Did he make the categories?

**Speaker A:** Well, he never— they say he never wrote anything down. And again, we have to use the brain that God gave us. He lived 3,000 years ago. We have modern teachers. I've seen it with my own eyes. Modern teachers where the students couldn't recall what the teacher was actually teaching to save their fucking lives. So don't put too much stock into um, that shit, you know. The Buddha was awesome. He said some cool shit in the early parts of the Pali Canon especially. And then later on, the monks kind of took over and they got a little culty and religious, and they kind of created this whole dream world bullshit. But, um, the Buddha didn't write anything down, they say, you know. So, you know, I don't think he gave too much of a shit about categorization. He said, they say, and see, what's the cool thing about Buddha is you don't have to rely on faith. I could take somebody like Buddha, Dhammarato, or Bhikkhu, and hear, read what they say, test it out for myself, and say, oh yeah, so that's what they got from the Buddha, that's what I'm getting from them. It seems, it seems from what I've tested, 100% scientifically accurate. So there's no need to play the Christian game of what did the original fathers say and how holy it was, which a lot of Buddhists do because they still have the mindset of the worldly mindset of birth and death, Samsara, Avidya, ignorance. They want a God. They want levels. They want things to be difficult so they can study and become the best student. That's what they love. So the Buddha just said, you want to shave your heads, you want to wear robes, go off in the forest and do it. It's no skin off my back. And they did. And he probably was more for it at the time because they were kind of considered outcasts, weirdos, even amongst the spiritual people. And the Buddha probably thought that was hilarious. But had he known that it would grow into a religious kind of cult based on superstitious rituals and shit, he probably would have been like, what are you doing? Because now when I put on the monk beads and the robe, I'm really somebody now. And people, you can see it even in the Sangha, people will just light up when there's a monk in the room. Oh, he has a golden robe and he has beads! Oh, how holy!

**Speaker B:** It's holy dog shit thinking about it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's just a costume you can get at a Halloween store. Oh, but he's part of a club. Big fucking deal.

**Speaker B:** All right, all right, we, uh, we disparaged, we, uh, shit on the monks in the monastery. Now it's also time to give them a little credit because, you know, sure, it's nice to have a place, uh, to escape society. You know, they had the orange robes, I believe, because prisoners wore orange robes and they wanted to be like, hey, we're outcasts. To, uh, at least one, uh, type of monastery did that, if I can recall.

**Speaker A:** Turn off the water. Yeah, I heard they used to get the robes off like the corpses in the graveyards because they just didn't have money to buy fabric, and they were just like— and the funeral pyres where they would like bring the bodies, if they were too poor to bury their dead, they would just wrap them in this cloth and a lot of times it happened to be like auburn or orange or red, and they would just use that rotting corpse flesh wrapped around them. But now it's become a fashion status symbol.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. But you know, like you were saying, you had a good point. There's wonderful monks. Of course I love monks. I love Buddhadasa, Bhikkhu. I love all these people. There's wonderful monks who are in it for the right reasons, who know. And Buddhadasa Bhikkhu used to grab his robe, by the way, and he would tell his students, this is just cloth, don't be so hypnotized by it. See, that's somebody who knows what they're doing. But you see a lot of people with arrogance, and it's not good in this day and age. It's almost more of a hindrance to become a monk than it is helpful. But solitude is quite helpful. And like you were saying, there is some monks who've done it and done it successfully. There's nothing wrong with becoming a monk. There's nothing wrong with a hammer. But again, it's how you use it. All these conceptual notions, how are you going to use them? To your advantage, to help others? Or are you going to cause destruction to yourself and others? And a monk is just another tool. It's like being a plumber. It's not special at all. What is special though is can you change your Dukkha into Sukkha? Can you go beyond liking and disliking, birth and death, here and now, being okay with the way things are? That is quite special. Yeah, quite special indeed. Can you give up the bullshit of this world? Can you give up every search? A lot of people can't, and a lot of people who say that they're spiritual spend their whole lives looking for that golden carrot until the day they die, and they never find it.

**Speaker B:** Yes, call off the search.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, call off the search. Fuck it. And who cares, you know? I don't know. Well, do whatever you want. I don't care what people do. I'm not here to convince anybody. Do whatever you wish.

**Speaker B:** Say yourself goodbye. Yeah, but then I know I'm a human and Searching is going to be inevitable. I'm going to be searching for my AirPods later today. And that's okay. I'll be searching the term Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** There's nothing wrong with searching. It's only when it becomes dukkha. But a lot of people don't have the wisdom to see that it's dukkha. There's nothing wrong with searching. A lot of people, in very subtle ways, the mind can trick us and think we're doing something special, and indeed we're just causing ourselves Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Strange, it was just me and you today. I thought it said 90 people. Were participating, but I guess that's everybody in the call.

**Speaker A:** Fuck them. When you tell the truth, there ain't gonna be much people that stick around. But if I said I'm from Thailand with my golden robe and big old beads, then everybody will come around. Just like in the West, PhDs— you ever see Guru Vikings podcast? It's almost like a medical podcast because it has so much doctors on that. Fucking show. I don't know how you can have a spiritual podcast. Yeah, doctor this, doctor that. What the fuck is the academia podcast? Because we're hypnotized.

**Speaker B:** Credentials mean something to— yeah, to a.

**Speaker A:** Lot of people in the physical world. It's, it's all they see. It's all they see. But they want to see the world that way, it's their choice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, he, um, but shout out to Guru Viking though, because he's had a lot of non-PhD people and a lot of people that I like. And if it wasn't for that show, then I wouldn't have found you personally.

**Speaker A:** Only thing I know is on his podcast I see a lot of doctors, doctor this, doctor that. It's just People can be hypnotized by this bullshit. Oh, you're a doctor, you're a doctor. Break the spell. See people as they are. See what they're saying, not what little kran is written above their head on some paper plaque. Some, you know, you have to, I don't know, it takes special eyes to see the world as it is. But people love the chains that bind them, so they love being fooled by bullshit. That's why snake oil salesmen are so successful. That's why the world is in the state it is. But anyways, yeah, it was nice seeing you. Do you have any more questions at all? Love you, man.

**Speaker B:** Nah, man, it was good talking to you.

**Speaker A:** You're awesome, dude. I had fun, man.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, from one Arhat to another.

**Speaker A:** Yes, we're the— we're level 39, level 40 Arahants, man. Everybody else is beneath us.

**Speaker B:** Huh?

**Speaker A:** All right, stay blessed, man.

**Speaker B:** I'll see you around.

**Speaker A:** Much peace and love.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, primarily led by **Speaker A** with contributions from **Speaker B**, is a direct, informal, and often provocative discussion that strips Buddhist practice down to its core essentials. Here is a summary of the key themes and teachings:

### Core Message: The Essence of Practice Over Form
The central argument is that the true goal of the Dhamma is to **end suffering (*dukkha*)** and **find peace and satisfaction here and now**. Everything else—rituals, robes, academic titles, Pali terminology, monastic status, and spiritual hierarchies—is secondary and can become a distraction if mistaken for the goal itself.

### Key Themes and Analogies

1.  **The Race Car Driver Analogy:** Spiritual practice is compared to auto racing. It doesn't matter how fancy your car (conditions), your uniform (robes), or your knowledge of mechanics (theory) is. All that matters is: **Can you drive well? Can you stay relaxed and win the race?** Similarly, can you actually gladden your mind and find peace where you are?
2.  **Practice When It's Hard:** True practice is tested not in ideal conditions (on a mountaintop), but in difficulty—in sickness, low energy, or "hell." As one speaker notes, "If it doesn't work in traffic, then what's the point?"
3.  **The Simplicity of the Teaching:** The Buddha's teaching is summarized as **"Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha"**—there is suffering, and there is a way to end it. The path is about **"look and change"**: using mindfulness (*sati*) to see suffering and then changing the mind's attitude toward it.
4.  **Warning Against Spiritual Materialism:** The talk strongly criticizes the obsession with credentials, levels of attainment (*Sotāpanna*, *Arhat*), and external symbols. These are called "bullshit things that don't matter" and "another rabbit to chase" that takes you away from the present moment. The pursuit of titles is seen as an ego project antithetical to awakening.
5.  **Ajahn Chah's Water Buffalo:** The mind is likened to a water buffalo that constantly wanders off the road (the Middle Path) to left (aversion) or right (grasping). The "fun game" of practice is to gently guide it back with the "stick" of mindfulness, without fighting it.
6.  **Pain vs. Suffering:** A crucial distinction is made. **Physical pain is inevitable** (even the Buddha felt it). **Mental suffering (*dukkha*), however, is optional.** It is a "concept" and a "wrong ignorant perception of reality." The goal is to feel pain without adding the layer of suffering.
7.  **"Good Enough" and Self-Compassion:** A recurring theme is learning to be satisfied with "good enough." This applies to life circumstances and to one's own practice. It's human to "fuck up"; the key is not to beat yourself up but to have compassion and gently return to the practice.
8.  **The Role of Community (Sangha):** The talk itself is an example of the Sangha's purpose: to remind each other of these simple truths and "get us out of our mud" when we forget.
9.  **Embodiment Over Theory:** While basic knowledge is helpful, the ultimate test is practice. **"You don't have to get it right, you just have to get it happily."** The real Dhamma is embodied in simple, kind actions—like caring for a pet—and in the unconditional, non-judgmental love exemplified by a good grandparent.

### Provocative Conclusions
*   **On Enlightenment:** Awakening (*Nibbana*) is demystified. It is described as being "chill," having a "cool mind," and finding a "carefree, light attitude" of freedom here and now.
*   **On Arhats:** The speaker provocatively claims that most who claim to be *Arhats* are "delusional assholes," arguing that the very desire for the title contradicts the state of non-attachment.
*   **On Monasticism:** While respecting sincere monks, the talk warns against the hypnotic effect of robes and status. They are mere "tools" or "costumes"; what matters is the quality of the practitioner's heart and mind.

### Overall Tone
The talk is delivered in a blunt, conversational, and humorous style, deliberately avoiding pious or scholarly language to emphasize the down-to-earth, practical, and immediately accessible nature of the Dhamma. Its purpose is to cut through spiritual pretense and redirect focus to the fundamental work of transforming one's own mind in the present moment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors** and reference a few **stories** to illustrate their points about Dharma practice. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **Metaphors**

1. **The Race Car Driver**  
   - **Description**: Compares spiritual practice to being a race car driver. You can have the best car (ideal conditions), a fancy uniform (robes, rituals), and know all the mechanics (theory), but what matters is whether you can *drive well*—stay relaxed, go fast, and win the race (find peace and joy here and now).  
   - **Purpose**: To emphasize that external trappings (rituals, status, scholarly knowledge) are less important than the actual ability to transform one’s mind in the present moment.

2. **Driving into a Brick Wall**  
   - **Extension of the race car metaphor**: If you’re driving your car (practice) into a brick wall (suffering, delusion), it doesn’t matter how much you know about the car. Better to be on a lawnmower (simple practice) staying on the road than in a perfect car headed for destruction.  
   - **Purpose**: Highlights the danger of being attached to knowledge or form without applying the Dharma to reduce suffering.

3. **The Water Buffalo (Ajahn Chah’s analogy)**  
   - **Description**: The mind is like a water buffalo that wanders off the road to the left (anger/aversion) or right (clinging/pleasure). The practitioner’s job is to gently guide it back to the middle with a stick (mindfulness/Sati).  
   - **Purpose**: Illustrates the continuous, playful work of mindfulness—recognizing when the mind is pulled into extremes and returning to balance.

4. **The Snake (Ajahn Chah’s analogy)**  
   - **Description**: The snake’s head represents suffering (anger, hatred), and the tail represents shallow, temporary happiness (sense pleasures). Ajahn Chah advises to “drop the whole snake”—let go of both aversion *and* clinging to transient pleasures—to find true, noble joy (Nibbana).  
   - **Purpose**: Teaches non-attachment to both negative *and* positive mental states, pointing toward a deeper freedom.

5. **The Shovel**  
   - **Description**: Concepts (like Dukkha) are tools, like a shovel. You can use a shovel to dig a garden (use Dukkha as a teacher) or to hit someone (use it to reinforce victimhood).  
   - **Purpose**: Emphasizes that our relationship to suffering is a choice—it can be either a hindrance or a path to insight.

6. **Grandparents’ Love**  
   - **Description**: The natural, non-judgmental love of grandparents is compared to the essence of Dharma—they may know nothing of Buddhism, but they embody loving-kindness (Metta) and acceptance.  
   - **Purpose**: To show that the core of Dharma is not intellectual but a heartfelt, compassionate presence.

---

### **Stories & References**

1. **Buddha on his deathbed**  
   - The Buddha experienced great physical pain but maintained the right attitude, seeing Mara (pain) without being overcome by suffering.  
   - **Purpose**: Distinguishes between unavoidable physical pain and optional mental suffering.

2. **Jesus and his disciples**  
   - References Jesus’ crucifixion and the persecution of his enlightened followers.  
   - **Purpose**: Illustrates that enlightenment doesn’t guarantee a pain-free life externally, but it brings inner peace regardless of circumstances.

3. **The Buddha’s ascetic practices**  
   - Mentions how the Buddha starved himself until emaciated before realizing the futility of extreme austerity and discovering the Middle Way.  
   - **Purpose**: Warns against striving too hard or making enlightenment a goal to be “achieved.”

4. **Monks’ robes from corpse cloth**  
   - References the historical practice of monks using burial shrouds (often orange) for robes, contrasting with modern attachment to robes as status symbols.  
   - **Purpose**: Critiques the shift from humble practicality to spiritual materialism.

---

### **Key Themes Reinforced by These Metaphors/Stories**

- **Practice over theory**: The race car driver, water buffalo, and shovel metaphors all stress *application* over mere knowledge.
- **Present-moment focus**: The grandparents’ love and “call off the search” refrain highlight contentment with “good enough” here and now.
- **Non-attachment**: The snake and water buffalo analogies teach letting go of both negative and positive mental clinging.
- **Anti-credentialism**: The race car uniform and PhD references mock the obsession with status in spiritual circles.
- **Suffering as a tool**: The shovel metaphor and the story of the Buddha’s deathbed reframe Dukkha as a potential teacher rather than a mere obstacle.

These metaphors and stories collectively paint a picture of Dharma as a down-to-earth, here-and-now practice of mindful kindness, free from dogma, status, and complex theory.
