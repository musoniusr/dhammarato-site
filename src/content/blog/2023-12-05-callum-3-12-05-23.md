### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, so Callum, you were saying that you've been practicing for the past several years, but now— go ahead.

**Speaker B:** About 3 years, I'd say.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. And what were you practicing before?

**Speaker B:** So, um, a lot of yogic techniques, really. So asanas, pranayama, mantra meditation, reading a lot of Advaita.

**Speaker A:** Reading a lot of what?

**Speaker B:** Advaita Vedanta.

**Speaker A:** Okay, Vedas, right. So what were you getting out of that?

**Speaker B:** A lot of energetic happenings, you know, the Kundalini phenomena and whatnot. I was doing a lot of that stuff.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and what did you get out of that? A lot of Kundalini?

**Speaker B:** Um, enough.

**Speaker A:** Okay, um, it takes quite a lot of correct practice in order to, uh, have those kind of phenomena going. But almost none of the teachers or any of the books talk about exactly what correct practice is, only in the sense of some of the results of correct practice. And that the correct practice is actually quite remarkably spelled out in the Eightfold Noble Path, which is not a path, it's a method. Like a way to do something or a highway. We use the word way for two different uses, but the word path is almost always used in the sense of a footpath, a horse path, an animal path, a path to enlightenment, rather than the method of enlightenment, because the method of enlightenment can happen right now. Yeah, path to enlightenment is going to take them lifetimes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I've realized that now.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, that's good. That's an important point, that most of the Western practice is not correct because it doesn't use all of the Eightfold Noble Path, and the one that's the most specifically missing is the right effort. And so if you're taking the right effort, then you're going to get the right results. The Mahasi Method is notorious, in fact, for only teaching two of the Eightfold Noble Path, right? Sati and investigation, except that their understanding of the investigation is to see that Dukkha find that Dukkha, rub that Dukkha on your skin, take it home with you, cut it up, put it in your food, get a load of it, connect this Dukkha to that Dukkha. And when you really, really, really understand Dukkha, then you'll be free from it. And that's not the case at all. Yeah, I know that all you have to do is just see it in the distance and then make a change so that you don't go playing with your own crap. Stop and enjoy life instead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it was good to hear that from you, how for the first time within practice I kind of felt like I'm able to take responsibility. Because before I was expecting the dukkha nanas, I was like, oh, I'm gonna have to go through hell, I'm gonna have to really hit the pits before I can make a change. But now I'm like, oh no, I can, I can do this.

**Speaker A:** Well, congratulations! I hope that you stay with that, because even when students do get that, they keep coming back with yet something new about why they're not going to practice correctly, because after all, they do have a problem now, a real one. Like, "Oh, I've had so much to do, I didn't call you because I was so busy." Well, the busyness is a good reason to call so that you won't be so busy. Or, oh, I didn't call you because I was sick.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Well, if you're sick, that's a good time to call.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's kind of what I realized. Oh, there's never a moment where I can't wake up. There's never a moment when I can't do this. I don't have to go to a hall and sit in a position like this is always now.

**Speaker A:** There's always a right now. With all of those centuries of time, there's never been a time when there was no right now. And the other part of it was, is that tomorrow's never come. You'll say, I'll do it tomorrow, but whenever you do it, you still do it right now. That in fact, people get really confused about calendars. Like, today is the 5th, and I'll do it tomorrow, which is like the 6th. No, when the 6th comes, it's going to be today. It's not going to be tomorrow. So we never do anything tomorrow. You always do it today. You always do it right now. Whenever you're doing something, we do it now.

**Speaker B:** How I managed to sort of— I really had some stifling kind of neurosis before, but that's how I've managed to deal with it. It's like, because I can't see the, um, can't invest in it anymore.

**Speaker A:** Isn't that remarkable?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's a relief.

**Speaker A:** So what should we talk about today? You have any particular questions?

**Speaker B:** I did have one. I don't want to get ahead of myself, but I heard you mentioned somewhere that there's formalized steps to Srotapanna.

**Speaker A:** All right, let us say that there are milestones that are written in suttas, and that I use a combination of Sutta Number 24, The Chariot Relay, and Sutta No. 48, which is the Kasambhyan Sutta. Now, Sutta No. 24 was a conversation between a monk that was living in a foreign area. He had gotten his Dharma from monks that had moved away, and he finally got around to coming for a ceremony or for some reason to see the Buddha. And Sariputta takes a look at this guy and corners him, going to check him out. And this guy also knows that he's with Sariputta and that he's on the spot. And so Sariputta asked him a series of questions, and to the Western ear it sounds weird. Okay, so the first question is Is Sati the path to enlightenment? The second question is: Is right noble Samatha, getting the mind together, is that the path to enlightenment? Is right noble viewing the path to enlightenment? Is knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path the path to enlightenment. And again, this monk answered, "Arahant Bhante, no." Okay, and so after a series of 7 questions, Sariputta asked him, "Why do you say no to each and every one of these questions?" And this is where the chariot race or the chariot relay comes in. And the guy answered it like this: Imagine that the king was leaving his palace in Sarnath and going to Rajgiri, and on the way he changes his chariot. So he'll go to one way stop, spend the night, and then get a new chariot and a new team of horses and goes to the next stop. And then he takes and gets to spend the night there, and then he gets a new set of horses, a new set of chariot, And he takes that, and after 7 days he gets to Rajgiri. But if the question is, will this chariot and this horse get me to Rajgiri, the answer is no. Does this make sense so far?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, so This is basically what we're meaning, is that you have to go through the stages of getting certain things going, a certain set of skills. And one skill at a time is normally done, but we need all of those skills. For instance, is a chef that specializes in soups, and I know in French cooking there are actually chef schools that specialize in sauces and soups. But he's not going to be able to be the head monk of a big restaurant. Also, there are guys who specialize in cutting vegetables, especially Asian, you know, like that, and spread it out, and it's a beautiful thing, right? But they're not going to be able to manage a whole restaurant because that's not enough. So we can develop a lot of different skills But when we get enough of the skills going, then we can be the head chef at the restaurant. So, the next sutta then, is the sutta about the Kshambhyan, and this is where we really begin to understand what's going on. And so, in this particular sutta, the first thing after the Preliminaries and the Situation with the Kassambians, he starts by defining what are the obstructions, what are the hindrances. This is the important point, is that we're going to define what the hindrances are, and then the Buddha makes the statement that when the practitioner comes to the point that he can say with surety that no matter how obstructed the mind becomes, no matter what hindrances are there, I can throw them out so that I can see what's really happening in this present moment. I can come to the truth of reality because I have removed those hindrances. All right, so almost any practitioner, or Westerner especially, that you meet cannot say that. They can say that, oh, well, sometimes I get sick and I don't want to practice, or, oh, sometimes I have too much to do and I'm too busy to practice, right? Or, oh, I got it and I was getting it, but now I can't get it, that something has obstructed my mind now and I can't do it. So the Buddha is saying that, uh, that in fact there are 7 knowledges that bring one about to the Sotapanna, and this is the first one. And then the Buddha says is that this first knowledge of confidence, that no matter what happens, I can clean my mind out and so that I can see things the way that they really are. Then he says that this is the first knowledge, this is the first step This is noble; this is supra-mundane. And what that means is, this is not held by ordinary people. Ordinary people will find things to complain about. In America, they complain about the IRS; they also complain about each other's political parties. They'll complain about a politician, they'll complain about their salaries, which means then that they're a victim to each and every one of the things that we complain about. Anything that you can find to complain about means that you're hindered by your complaining about it. And the solution to that would be that no matter what obstruction, no matter what complaint comes up in your mind, you can say, 'Hot dog, I can see that I just did that, and let me stop doing it right now and come out of that state of being obstructed.' And that I know that I can. I know that no matter what happens, I can stop doing it and come throw that stuff out, and then I can see things the way that they really are. And the most important quality that I think to that is that this is not held by ordinary people. You have already made the first step of enlightenment is when you get to that knowledge, when you come to that knowledge that I can clean out my mind. This is why I go around talking about shampoo bottles. You know, on the back of every shampoo bottle that's sold at 7-Eleven or on the grocery store, those shampoo bottles, if you look on the back of the bottle It says the entire teaching of the Buddha: rinse and repeat. Right? Isn't that on the back of all the shampoo bottles? Isn't that exactly what we're talking about here? No matter how dirty the mind gets, I'm going to clean it out. Then I'm going to repeat that again and again and again until we get the confidence that I can throw all of that stuff out of the mind. Okay, now this works very well with the Sutra Number 24, especially if you see what happens in the intermediate. So the second knowledge is that we— and this is one of the few places where the word Samatha is used, and I will point out that you've probably heard about Samatha and Vipassana. Vipassana is almost never used, and Samatha is only used occasionally, and this is the place where it's used. And the Samatha here is actually referring to all of the first Jhana, in the sense of not only having the hindrances out of the mind, but we also have that feel-good quality. We have knowledge and vision that I can in fact get myself into a state of unification of mind, or into the state of Samadhi. And this is the second, that is said to be the second step of the Srotapanna, and that this second step is noble, this second step is supramundane, it's above the world, and this is not a position that's held by ordinary people. Why? Because ordinary people don't have this experience of having the mind cleaned out and also being able to control their feelings, and this is a knowledge and vision of that second knowledge. Now we'll take the point here, is to say that generally in other Suttas, Srotapanna is broken into two major phases. One is the path and the other one is the fruit, in the Pālamagga. So, we actually have the path, and this is the first and second step that is still the practice, not the fruit. This is not the benefit of the first Jhana, This is only the taking of the step, but if we talk about it correctly, that means that the label Srotapanna either doesn't apply at all anywhere, or it applies in this very first and second step. So you having the knowledge and vision that I can clean out my mind. I know I can do it at any particular time, no matter how the mind gets disturbed or destructed. I could see that and stop it and bring the mind back. This is actually getting into the Dharma. The word Srotapanna is sometimes referred to also as stream entry, and we can think of it as entering the stream of the Dhamma And the stream of things is: I can get out of the hindrances, I can get out of the hindrances, I can get out of the hindrances, I can get out of the hindrances. And then the second one, the stream, would be: I can relax and feel good, I can relax and feel good, I can relax and feel good, I can relax and feel good. All right, so the third step is coming— this is where I add the two sutras together most specifically, because in the third chariot, it actually states that knowledge and vision actually support this thing, but it's got a particular viewpoint to it. And that's the knowledge and vision that I understand what is the path and what is not the path. Knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path, or in the case of what we're talking about, the method. That I've got it wired. I really do get the entire Eightfold Noble Path, got it down solidly, without a doubt. I got it. Okay, this is the third knowledge, and that third knowledge for sure is now noble, for sure it is now supramundane, and for sure this is not held by ordinary people. Very few people have that kind of confidence that they know without a doubt that they know exactly how to live their lives. They know exactly the method to apply to every moment so that they have freedom. Okay, and then we come to the next one, step number 4. Now step number 4 is actually kind of a fulcrum. It's an important point. Because now the table has tipped. Now we're going out of just the path into the actual fruit. Okay, and the actual point of the fourth one is what the Pātimokkha is all about. Okay, we got a guy here that's wanting to become a monk, and so this is the point about the Pātimokkha is the confessional. Because in order to do the Patti Mokkha, we have to say a little phrase in Pali, but also it has the quality of actually recognizing any wrongdoing, any problems, any lies that we've told, any behaviors that we've done that are harmful, and we confess that to either our teacher or to a senior monk. And that we do this as we enter the Patti Mokkha, so that during the Patti Mokkha celebration and ritual, at the end of it— and this happened in the time of the Buddha, where he would look around the entire assembly and says, 'Oh monks, each and every one of you, look around this assembly, and do you see even one person who is not worthy of being here. Ah, so that means that no matter how mad a monk messed up last week, we see him as pure now, especially our own self. So we can take this then to say that we accept our wrongdoing. That it's actually just wrongdoing. It's not that we broke a law, it's not that it's illegal, it's not that we have a fallen angel or anything like that, but rather that we accept ourselves the way that we are, warts and all. That's an old expression that I use commonly, okay, that you actually accept the wrongdoing and the problems that you've made, the term of the efforts that we have put in that have failed, and we accept ourselves the way things are. This is hard. In fact, the number one cause of lying that we have in society, the ordinary people, they don't have this, because they lie because they don't accept themselves the way that they are. In fact, we go into denial. I'm not worth it, I will not admit to my wrongdoing, I'm trying to hide it, I'm trying to say, "Oh, I didn't do that," I want to get away with it, rather than acknowledging it, seeing for what it is, because if we're not willing to really look at what's going on, we're not going to be able to get over it. We're going to continue to hide from it while we still do it. Okay, this is a big point. This is in fact the middle of it, and this is the transition from the knowledge, or the path, which is actually knowledge, and the deliverance. That in fact, this is the point of deliverance. We're delivered from our wrongdoing by acknowledging it, admitting it, seeing it clearly, and being able to do something about it. Well, in a way, we're going right back to repeating the whole point about the hindrances, aren't we? That's what this is all about, is to see in the very beginning, can you see those hindrances in your mind and forgive yourself? The way that Goenka phrases it is, "When the mind wanders away from the breath," Never mind, start again. That's the never mind quality. Is this step 4? Is give yourself a break. Stop criticizing yourself for your wrongdoing. Nurture yourself for being happily able to see it and do something about it.

**Speaker B:** Because unification of mind kind of is— that's quite imperative, isn't it?

**Speaker A:** Yes, this is actually the beginning of the unification of the mind. It's because we can accept our wrongdoing, we can accept ourselves and nurture ourselves, warts and all, just like a mother of a tender infant will accept that infant the way that they are. Little infants will scream like bloody hell, they'll keep the family up all night long, they poop all over the place, they want food, you know. And mom will put up with that child when it's very young, but when the kid gets 4 or 5 or even 16, if he takes a crap on the living room floor, now they're going to criticize him. They're not going to nurture, right? And so we go from the transition of everything absolutely is wonderful as little children into, "Get your act together, kid! Go clean up your room! Do your homework!" wash the dishes, do what you're told to do. We've got to get you ready to be miserable for the rest of your life. You do what you're told to do and don't like it. And that's the way that we train our children. Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, he'll do what he's told to do, and he will be miserable doing it.

**Speaker B:** That's how.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** That's our whole society.

**Speaker A:** That's our whole society. That's the whole show right then and there. All right, that we're not supposed to accept our wrongdoing. We're supposed to be— to change that and do what we're told to do. And we begin to lie. Oh mom, I didn't do it. Um, Al Sharpton, one of the, uh, preachers come politician, has the old story that he and his little friend found that Mom had made, or Granny had made, a blueberry pie, and they had some. And she walks in and sees that both kids have blueberry pie all over their face. And so she asked them, what happened to the blueberry pie? Oh, I don't know. Oh, I don't know. And there, the blueberry pie is all over their face. Oh, I don't know. See, we lie. We don't want to be held responsible for our own wrongdoing, and the whole point of being a monk is to get over that. Accept your wrongdoing. Yeah, Granny, I had the blueberry pie. It was so delicious. Thank you very much. You did a marvelous job of that blueberry pie. I couldn't resist it. And what's Granny going to do then? But if she catches you lying, oh, I didn't take it, she's going to beat the out of you. So that's how we can learn to live our lives. Oh, I did what I did because of my own ignorance, because of my own stupidity, and I can learn. This is where we begin to get the fruit of the Srotapanna. So step 5 in this Kasambien Sutta number 48 in the Anagami Nikaya also kind of parallels what is in the sutta number Number 24, in the sense that we begin to pay attention now to the Dharma, really dedicated to it. There are two examples in the sutta. One is that the monk, even though he has sweeping duties or cleaning duties for the wat, still he is thinking about the Dharma. He sees Dharma everywhere. Dhamma, Dhamma, Dhamma, Dhamma, that's all there is. And he thinks about it and he studies it and he looks at it and he is glad to go hear the Dhamma talk. He is glad to listen. He wants to hear the Dhamma. He spends all of his time looking at the Dhamma. The other example is like a cow who gives birth to a calf. And that even though she eats grass, she's got one eye on that calf. She positions herself between the forest and the field that they're eating in, so that if anything comes out of that forest to attack that calf, she's going to be there. You see that in the videos that they have of Africa, where the lions are after the cubs, the baby elephants, and the mother elephants will stand right there. You got to come through me to get to this baby. All right, so that's the way that we begin to live our lives. If you want to get to me, you got to come through the Dharma, because the Dharma is my protection, and I'm staying with the Dharma no matter what. Okay, so this is a very good position because now the fruit is actually showing that we have Dharma on the brain all the time. I see that done with the students. She'll come on to the Skype groups or on Discord and they'll say, "Dharma's it, Dharma's all there is, I see Dharma in everything." So that's the statement of Step 5 right there, that we got nothing to do but Dharma. Yeah, we can do a little bit of sweeping, but it's a Dhamma sweeping. So, that's Step 5. Step 6 then, is the key word is eager, that we become eager for the Dharma. Not only do we have it on the brain, but we go out seeking the Dharma everywhere. We go looking for it everywhere. We want to hear those teachings. We want to talk to people. We don't want to shut up about the Dharma. I got the only thing I've got to say is Dhamma, Dhamma, Dhamma, Dhamma, Dhamma. I can't shut up about it. This is at the level then is where students actually become budding teachers, because they can't shut up about the Dharma. That's all they've got to say. All right, and we're eager for the Dharma, we're looking for the Dharma. That what am I going to do for the next 10 minutes? Let's go read a sutta. Let's go find something to do, like watch the breath. Let's get into the Dharma. So, we begin to get completely dedicated to the Dharma now, because we're so eager for it. And this is step 6, this is the 6th knowledge that is now the fruit of the path. It is now the getting noble, really noble. All the time, Noble, or at least every time that we talk of— there we go, this is the Dharma, that's all I care about. And then it is super mundane, and it's still for sure now not held by ordinary people. The guys on Wall Street, they'll get really eager about money that they're losing, but they're not for the Dhamma. So scientists, will get really, really stuck in their writing mathematics on the blackboard, but they don't have any joy, they have the drive. So now we're talking about a kind of a drive that we have, this eager for the Dharma, that we're driven for it, that we don't want anything else, all there is is Dharma. By now, this is the kind of time when people are going to ordain. They can't have nothing but the Dharma, and so they want to be in the Dharma. They want to be around people who are in the Dharma. They want to be in the wat. They want to be in the place where they can get the Dharma all the time. They want to stay away from the bars. They want to stay away from the office and the workplaces. They want to stay with just the Dhamma. Okay, so What could step 7 possibly be? What is the real fruit? What is the termination and the penultimate of the fruit of Srotapanna? The answer to that is becoming delighted that you can find and see Dharma everywhere. You become delighted and enthusiastic and eager But the confidence is that everything is joyful, everything is top quality, that because all you have is the Dhamma and the emptiness, and wow, what a trip that is! And so, that's the penultimate, or the end of the point of Srotapanna, is And look at all of this stuff that we've gone through so far, is that wow, we've got the mind trained, wow, we've got the path down correctly, wow, we have forgiven ourselves of all of our stuff and accept ourselves, warts and all, that we're completely dedicated to the Dhamma, we're completely enthusiastic about the Dhamma, and now we are joyful, we get our— and the words that we would use would be like Anandi, like Ananda. Okay, Ananda means the bliss, the happiness, the joy, the enthusiasm, all built together. And that's also the word is Rato, or Rata. This is where the name Dhammarato comes from. They gave that name to me, and I took that as a task to do, is to become delighted in the Dharma.

**Speaker B:** Are you doing a good job?

**Speaker A:** Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Doing a good job.

**Speaker A:** Well, I have a friend, by the way. His name is Dhammavitu, and what that means is knower of the Dharma, the vision of the Dharma. So his name is that he has the ability to know the Dharma. And he's the one who's translating, by the way, the latest translator, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. The newest book on the shelf is written by Dhammavitu, my good friend. So, this is what the path really is. These are why names are given, by the way, is either it describes some quality that the man already has when he's being ordained, Or it's a name the Upajaya gives him to say, this is your job, this is your duty. Your duty to the Dhamma is to become delighted in the Dhamma, because there ain't nothing else. That's all there is. Let's go have fun. And at this point, the tradition is that this is when the student of the Dharma, the Srotapanna, is now a fully qualified teacher. This in fact are the ones who make the best Dharma teachers, because they can't shut up about the Dharma. That's all you're going to get from them is Dhamma, Dhamma, Dhamma, Dhamma, Dhamma. And when you get into that life, they make Tibet to where Someone who is an Arahant, he doesn't really care so much about the students. He's really above it all, right? But the Srotapanna is the one who just can't shut up about it. That's all he's got to say, because he takes great delight. And thank you for calling, because you give me an opportunity to take again great delight in talking about the Dharma. So do you have any questions? Did I answer you? That was well enough.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, take in. So obviously those 7 steps— what were the sutras you said? Was it MN 48?

**Speaker A:** Yes, the Kosambhyan Sutta number 48, and Sutta number 24 that has a slightly different version of it. In the sense of that they talk about steps 6 and 7 is knowledge and vision of what it is like to be noble, or what it is like actually to become noble. Okay, so an example of that is, is that the guy who was in the valley going to climb the mountain. So the first thing that he does is he's got the determination that he's going to climb that mountain. The next thing he does is he gathers up all the camping equipment and all of the goods that he's going to need to climb that mountain, including maps and anything else that he's going to need along the way. And then he gets up on the plateau, so now he can look down and he can see that valley, whoa, far away. But the hilltop is still above him. And now the last step is, is that he's climbed to that mountaintop, and now the village is so far away, can you barely see it? But instead of seeing a great big mountain around you everywhere, when you're on top of the mountain, you have a 360-degree vista. You can really see the Dhamma. Okay, so that's those two suttas, the way that they're expressed go completely hand in hand. They are in fact two different versions of the same sutta. Funny that one's double the other one. One's number 24 and the other one is number 48, but that's just synchronicity because the Uh, I would go so far as to say that the Kansambhyan Sutra is actually doubly good, that we do need Sutra number 24 to understand some of the stuff, but the real explanation, the doubling, is in Sutra number 48.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And this is what makes a good teacher. The rest of the path is to start dropping some of the stuff that you really know. So you could also say that the, uh, the path then is, uh, knowledge and then deliverance, right? And that this is the— this is the step of Srotapanna, which is, by the way, also known as the elimination of the first three fetters.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah, I've heard of the tangpas.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so the first fetter then is understanding that who you are is not important, that in fact who you are is irrelevant. And yet you'll find a lot of the stuff in the Hindu and in many other places, well, they'll say is, is that you have to figure out who you are. You'll never figure out who you are, but that's in fact wrong way of paying attention. It's what they call unwise attention. So I'm adding a third sutta now, and that third sutta is the Sabbāsava Sutta, Sutta 2 in the Majjhima Nikāya. This is where we talk about knowledge and deliverance, and the first thing that we have to do is to gain that knowledge. What is the three knowledges? You are not who you thought you were, and you will probably never figure it out. But what you do pay attention to is the Four Noble Truths. This is Dukkha. This is the cause of Dukkha. Wow, what a relief! This is the finish of the Dukkha right now, and this is the method that we get there. And then when we're paying attention to the Four Noble Truths, then we kind of forget all about who am I, my, me, and my, and all of that. But also, we gain victory over the— the Pali word is silavata paramasa. Silavata paramasa is not so well translated as attachment to rites, rules, and rituals. But Eric Byrne and Sigmund Freud gave great insight into this that Freud called it the superego, and Eric Berne called it the parent ego state. When we're little kids, we listen to the parents, we learn what they had to say, we pick up all their supposed-tos, all their rules, all their criticisms, etc., all their standards, and we remember that. And then when we get older, we start beating the hell out of ourselves with the bludgeon of all of these rules, these standards.

**Speaker B:** And that's neurosis.

**Speaker A:** That's neurosis, is not living up to your own standards. So what we begin to do then is to drop all of these rules, drop all of these standards, stop fussing and complaining about ourselves in the world. That's the second one. And the third one is the eradication of doubt. Now what does that mean and how does that relate? The doubt about the knowledge and vision of what is and is not the path. We are completely free from any doubts about, "This is how I'm going to live my life. I'm going to live my life Dharma. I'm going to follow the teachings of the Buddha, that's it." And they get enormously happy out of that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's quite simple, isn't it?

**Speaker A:** It really is. And so these first three fetters are called the knowledge. This is what the Srotapanna has. He does not have all of the defilements kicked in the butt, but he does have the delight that he's willing to look at those defilements. He's willing to look at his greed. He's willing to look at the things that he doesn't like. And the reason that he doesn't like stuff is because they don't meet his standards. When we develop the point of forgetting about the standards, then everything is already okay. It's already a paradise if we'd only stop judging it.

**Speaker B:** That's freedom, man.

**Speaker A:** That's the freedom that comes about the knowledge is that now we can see what's there and we can put that junk away. We can drop it. Okay, so the last thing that we can talk about is, is that then what is, uh, the Sotogami? The Sotogami is the one who is starting to see that stuff and starting to eliminate it. Now, in the beginning, I mean, when we're really little kids, we're taught you should not play with fire, and when we get burned, we stop playing with it. Actually, I have never stopped playing with fire. I don't think anybody does. We light candles, we pour wax around, we make beautiful things out of fire, we mold metal with it, all kinds of stuff. But we don't get burned because we see it, and so we can avoid the pain. So this is the point about the Sotagami, is that he could see the Dukkha and he doesn't get burned so much anymore. But when he gets to the point of Anagami, that's when he doesn't get ever burned, right? But he still plays with fire.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** But he doesn't ever get burned. And then the Arahant is the one who even stops playing with the fire.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And Arahants, except for rare occasions like the Buddha recognized in his early freedom, was that if he doesn't teach the Dharma, nobody will. But in the modern times, we have seen, in fact, that this is coming true because the Arahants that do come around because they've come through getting rid of all of the stuff, they don't make very good teachers. That at best what they become is very much like the old Zen master. All you're going to get out of him is a one-liner. You either get that one-liner or he's gone. That's just it. But that's all they give is one-liners. An example of one of the one-liners is that the two monks are sitting there and they're quibbling over, does the flag flutter, or is it the wind moving that gives the appearance of the flag fluttering? And the old Zen master comes by and says something like, it's the mind that flutters. That's all he has to say. Another example of the old Zen master is, he's walking down the street and on the street corner There is a Christian and an atheist having a conversation about hell, and the atheist says, there ain't no hell. And the Christian says, the hell there ain't. And the Buddhist walks by and just kind of mentions, hell, you're both in it right now.

**Speaker B:** The state of mind.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the state of mind. And so this is where the Arahant is. He doesn't bother to teach all the details of the Dharma. He just says one line. If you get it, you got it.

**Speaker B:** So to play with and not get burned, is that a bit like how Jesus said, being in the world but not of it?

**Speaker A:** Right. So he was teaching that. Unfortunately, he wasn't able to take his own advice. Yeah, that he'd never been to Jerusalem before, but when he went into Jerusalem, he got to ride on a donkey and people were praising and all of that kind of stuff. But his first stop was at the temple, and he saw those bankers, and he goes in there and raises hell, and within a week he's nailed to the cross. Now the right thing to have done was to go on to Caiaphas, the head priest at the time, and say, hey, wouldn't you have a whole lot more room in your temple to get really good stuff done if you had the bankers go out into the parking lot, out onto the forum, put up their tents and do their money changing, and keep the animals out there and keep the temple itself clean. But Jesus didn't do that way. He didn't go make friends with Caiaphas. He went in there and raised hell, and then he had to put up with it. And so Jesus did not actually live up to his own standards of being in the world but not of it. Can you be in the world but not of it? Can you stay above it? Can you stay in that supramundane? Can you stay out of— in each one of these stages of the seven stages of Srotapanna, in each one of them we become different than ordinary people.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we're not at the behest of our environment.

**Speaker A:** That we can deal with various environments without getting stuck into it. So that's about it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I was just wondering, when can it be said that the first fetter is dropped?

**Speaker A:** When you know When you have practiced the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path, and you've got that confidence that you've got it without a doubt— this is all the elimination of doubt, even to the point of the doubt of knowledge and vision of what is and what is not the path— you've got that wired. You know what you're doing is not the Dhamma, or you know for sure that what you're doing is Dharma. This is the third knowledge. You're not following the rules anymore, that what you do is to avoid Dukkha. So an example of that is there's a lot of videos on YouTube about police and how people handle police. One guy's got a camera just to antagonize the police so that they'll bust him, and others are when the police are out there on the road giving people tickets or taking them to jail or whatnot. How are you going to handle the police? Are you going to handle it according to the standards and the way that they say? Are you going to handle it with knowledge and vision of what is Dukkha and what is not? In other words, why don't we make friends with the police? Why don't we congratulate them? Why don't we give them what they want, happily? Do you have the Dhamma well enough down so that you can be delighted to see the cop when he's busting you? Can you happily hold your hands back and say, "Oh yes, I'll wear these handcuffs, just don't make them too tight"? I'm okay. Yeah, I'll cooperate with you, but I don't have anything to say, but I'd be very happy to be friends with you. So that's the way that we would handle that, is by instead of following the rules or even giving credit for the cop having rules he wants you to follow. But rather, our job is to be friends, to be friendly, to not cause Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Create less friction, right?

**Speaker A:** No friction at all. Then in fact, the likelihood is that he's not going to bust you, he's not going to search your car, he's not going to give you any trouble at all because he knows that you're completely friendly. You're not afraid of him at all. You don't see any problem with what he's doing. You accept him completely the way that he is. Boy, is that hard, because we want to see that Dukkha. Oh, you're a bad cop. Oh, all these cops are a bunch of crooks. 'Oh, I mean, you're trained to be a bully and here you are bullying me.' And the real answer to that is, 'Yeah, but by acting that way, we're creating the Dukkha.'.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So let's not create any Dukkha. Let's not give the cop any Dukkha at all. So that becomes our new rule. We only need one rule, and that is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Yeah, that's the only rule we need.

**Speaker B:** Great summary.

**Speaker A:** And when we— when the mind wanders away from the breath, let's not give ourselves dukkha by saying, oh, you can't meditate, or your mind is no good, or why I need better instructions, or maybe the teacher's no good, and all of that kind of stuff. That we go through because we don't like that the mind is not trained, rather than happily training the mind to be gentle and kind to ourselves. Ah, aha, I see that. I see the mind wandered away. Never mind, start again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's the big attitude change I've got from you. It's going really well.

**Speaker A:** Good one. So you keep practicing like that, and pretty soon you've got no more Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Q] Yeah, great!

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] You have confidence that you can live your life happily, no matter what happens.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Q] That's infectious!

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] That's right, that's why we don't actually teach the Dharma in the sense of proselytizing, that the student comes to the teacher because they can see that the teacher has something to offer. Rather than you going out there and selling the Dharma. So the best way to handle the public, if they don't know anything about the Dharma and not asking you for the Dharma, don't give it to them. What you give them instead is friendship. Give them a smile, give them joy, and the joy itself will be infectious, and then they'll start asking questions, and now you can teach the Dharma. Because they want something. So do you have any more questions? I guess this is enough for today.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's where— that's a lot. Um, it's great. Yeah, I'm learning so much.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. Well, we'll see you soon.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Glad to see you on the other calls. You can start talking to our friends on the, uh, the Skype, the UK, and the Skype US. There's always something interesting there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'll go on the Discord too.

**Speaker A:** Excellent, excellent.

**Speaker B:** Okay, thanks a lot, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** We'll see you.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a student named Callum (Speaker B), centers on correcting common misunderstandings about Buddhist practice and outlining the clear, methodical path to the first stage of enlightenment (*Sotāpanna*).

Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Critique of Common Practice**
*   Dhammarato begins by addressing Callum's prior practice in yogic and Advaita traditions, which led to "energetic happenings" like Kundalini phenomena. He notes that while such results require correct practice, most teachings don't clearly define what "correct practice" is.
*   He argues that much Western practice is incorrect because it doesn't utilize the full **Eightfold Noble Path**, which he reframes not as a long "path" but as a **"method"** that can be applied right now. The most commonly missing factor is **Right Effort**.
*   He criticizes methods (like the Mahasi method) that over-emphasize investigating *dukkha* (suffering/stress), suggesting the real point is to **see dukkha from a distance and make a change** to stop creating it.

### **The Attitude Shift: Taking Responsibility Now**
*   Callum shares his breakthrough: instead of expecting to have to go through painful "dukkha ñānas" (insight knowledges), he realized he could **take responsibility for his mind at any moment**. There's never a moment when he "can't do this."
*   Dhammarato emphasizes this point: we always act in the **"right now."** We never do anything "tomorrow"; when the time comes, it's always "now." Therefore, the practice is always available.

### **The Seven-Step Method to Sotāpanna (Stream-Entry)**
The heart of the talk is an explanation of the progression to Stream-Entry, synthesizing two suttas (MN 24 and MN 48). The seven steps are framed as a movement from **knowledge** to **fruit**.

**1. Confidence in Cleaning the Mind:** The first knowledge is the unshakable confidence that **no matter what hindrances arise (doubt, anger, sloth, etc.), you can recognize and remove them** to see reality clearly. This alone is "supramundane" (not held by ordinary people). Dhammarato likens this to the shampoo bottle instruction: **"rinse and repeat."**

**2. Confidence in Samadhi (Unification):** The second knowledge is the confidence that you can not only clear the hindrances but also enter a **calm, unified, and joyful state of mind** (samādhi, related to jhāna).

**3. Knowing the Path:** The third knowledge is **unwavering understanding of the method itself**—the Eightfold Noble Path. You know "without a doubt" how to apply it in every moment for freedom.

**4. Acceptance & Forgiveness (The Fulcrum):** This is the pivotal step from *knowledge* to *fruit*. It involves **complete self-acceptance**, acknowledging your mistakes and "wrongdoing" without denial or harsh self-criticism. You forgive yourself, "warts and all," just as a mother cares for a messy infant. This breaks the cycle of lying and hiding from your faults.

**5. Dhamma on the Brain:** The fruit begins to manifest. Your mind is **constantly inclined toward the Dhamma**. Even during daily tasks, your underlying focus is on the teachings, like a protective mother cow always mindful of her calf.

**6. Eagerness for Dhamma:** This evolves into an **active, eager seeking** of the Dhamma. You want to read, discuss, and practice constantly. At this stage, practitioners often become "budding teachers" because they can't stop talking about the Dhamma.

**7. Delight in Dhamma:** The culminating fruit is **joy and delight (*ānanda*) in the Dhamma itself**. Everything is seen through the lens of Dhamma, which brings happiness. A person at this stage makes an ideal teacher because they teach from a place of infectious joy.

### **Related Insights & Conclusions**
*   **The Three Fetters:** This seven-step process results in cutting the first three fetters that bind one to suffering: (1) belief in a permanent self/identity-view, (2) attachment to rites, rules, and rituals (or the internal "parental" critic/superego), and (3) doubt about the path.
*   **Teaching Style:** Dhammarato contrasts the enthusiastic, talkative **Sotāpanna** teacher (delighting in sharing the Dhamma) with the stereotypical **Arahant** (fully enlightened) teacher who might only offer cryptic one-liners. The Sotāpanna's joy is what makes them effective.
*   **Practical Application:** The method boils down to one guiding principle: **see *dukkha*, cease creating it, and cultivate joy.** The attitude is one of gentle persistence: "Never mind, start again." This friendly, non-conflictual approach should extend to all life situations (he uses the example of interacting with a police officer).

**Overall Theme:** The talk demystifies enlightenment's first stage, presenting it as an attainable, structured progression of mental skills and attitudes, centered on self-responsibility, self-forgiveness, and culminating in joyful confidence in the Dhamma. The emphasis is always on practical application in the present moment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several **metaphors** and **stories** to explain Buddhist concepts and the path to enlightenment (Sotāpanna). Here is a breakdown:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The Highway/Method vs. The Footpath:** He contrasts the common idea of the **Eightfold Noble Path** as a long, gradual "path to enlightenment" (like a footpath) with the idea of it as a **"method" or "highway"** that can be applied right now for immediate results.
2.  **The Shampoo Bottle:** He humorously compares the entire teaching of the Buddha to the instructions on a shampoo bottle: **"rinse and repeat."** This symbolizes the continuous process of cleaning the mind of hindrances (defilements) and starting over with a clear mind.
3.  **The Chef's Specialization:** To explain the need for developing a complete set of skills (all parts of the Eightfold Path), he uses the metaphor of a chef who specializes **only in soups or cutting vegetables**. Such a specialist cannot run an entire restaurant; similarly, partial practice is insufficient for enlightenment.
4.  **The Mountain Climber:** He uses the journey of a **mountain climber** (determination, gathering gear, reaching a plateau, finally achieving the summit vista) to illustrate the progressive "knowledges" or stages leading to Sotāpanna.
5.  **Playing with Fire:** He describes the stages of enlightenment (Sotāpanna, Anāgāmi, Arahant) using the metaphor of **playing with fire**:
    *   **Sotāpanna:** Learns to see the fire (suffering/dukkha) and avoids getting burned most of the time.
    *   **Anāgāmi:** Plays with fire but **never gets burned**.
    *   **Arahant:** Stops playing with fire altogether.
6.  **The Mother and the Infant:** To explain self-acceptance (a key step), he contrasts a mother's unconditional nurturing of a messy, screaming **infant** with how society later criticizes and controls the child, teaching it to be miserable by following external rules.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Chariot Relay (Sutta 24):** He recounts the story from the **Chariot Relay Sutta (MN 24)**. A king travels from one city to another, changing chariots and horses at each stop. No single chariot completes the entire journey. This story illustrates that no single factor (like mindfulness or concentration alone) is "the path," but rather a successive series of skills and vehicles are needed to reach the final goal.
2.  **The Blueberry Pie Lie:** He tells an anecdote about **Al Sharpton** (or a similar figure) as a child, with blueberry pie all over his face, lying to his grandmother about eating the pie. This story exemplifies how we are conditioned to deny our own wrongdoing instead of accepting responsibility with honesty and humor.
3.  **The Protective Mother Cow/Elephant:** Drawing from **Sutta 48**, he describes a **mother cow** who always positions herself between her calf and the forest, or **mother elephants** protecting their young from lions. This symbolizes the practitioner in the later stages, whose mind is so dedicated to the Dhamma that it becomes their constant protector and reference point.
4.  **Jesus and the Money Changers:** He offers a critical story about **Jesus in the temple**. He suggests that Jesus, by violently confronting the money changers instead of diplomatically suggesting a solution to the high priest, failed to live up to his own teaching of being "in the world but not of it," and thus created more conflict (dukkha).
5.  **Zen Koans/One-Liners:** To describe the teaching style of an Arahant, he references classic **Zen stories**:
    *   The monks debating whether the flag or the wind moves, and the master saying, "**It is the mind that flutters.**"
    *   The master overhearing an argument about the existence of hell and commenting, "**Hell, you're both in it right now.**"
6.  **Dealing with a Police Officer:** He creates a hypothetical scenario about being pulled over by a **police officer**. The Dhamma practice, he suggests, is to respond with complete friendliness and zero friction, accepting the situation without creating additional dukkha through resistance or judgment. This illustrates living by the principle of "dukkha, nirodha" (suffering, cessation of suffering) rather than by societal rules or reactions.

### **Core Narrative Framework**
The entire talk is structured around explaining the **"seven steps" or "seven knowledges" of a Sotāpanna** as synthesized from two suttas (MN 24 and MN 48). The metaphors and stories are woven into this framework to make the stages relatable:
*   **Early Steps (Path):** The shampoo bottle (cleaning the mind), the chef (needing all skills).
*   **Middle Step (Fulcrum):** The blueberry pie (accepting wrongdoing), the mother and infant (self-nurturing).
*   **Later Steps (Fruit):** The protective mother animal (Dhamma as protection), the mountain climber (achieving the vista), the infectious joy of the teacher.

These devices effectively translate abstract Buddhist doctrine into vivid, memorable, and often humorous everyday imagery.
