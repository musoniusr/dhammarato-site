### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So first off, Joe, it's really good to see you again. Yeah, and you say you spent a couple of weeks at, uh, uh, the, the wat in Portugal.

**Speaker B:** Yes, Sumadurama is the name of it, and I was there for, uh, yeah, 2 and a half weeks at the beginning of November.

**Speaker A:** How did you find the place?

**Speaker B:** I went first to Dhammapala last summer, and I like the Thai forest tradition. And on the Forest Sangha website, they just list all the places in Europe. And yeah, then I emailed them and asked if I could stay, and I said I was coming from a long way, so could I stay longer than a week? Because usually they say they only let you stay for a week, and since I've been practicing a long time, they're like, yeah, you can stay longer. And, um, so yeah, I stayed 2 and a half weeks there.

**Speaker A:** And so you had a question about sexuality specifically?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, which I think is a super common question that is talked of, like, yeah, what do you actually do when you're a sexually active person and you enjoy sexuality in your personal life, and then you in environments, yeah, where like, it's not like, like at that point it's not a mental thing of like, oh, I really want sexuality. It felt more like a physical, like, how in the world would I do this if this was more than 2 and a half weeks?

**Speaker A:** All right, well, here's the point, is that it's built into our genes. You could say that whatever it is that is the self-preservation mechanism that you have is part of your instinct. That spills over to not just the preservation of you individually, but the propagation of the species. And so you could say then that that DNA or that nature in us is playing a dirty trick. And what is the dirty trick? Is that it teaches us that that very, very deep DNA level is not even at the gut level. It's even deeper than that, down to the DNA level. They make it, uh, or the DNA makes it appear pleasurable, that we want it, that we're attracted to it, right?

**Speaker B:** It's also that, that I'm 35, and so I'm at the prime age for like, you need to have children, like that sort of like, you know, thing, right?

**Speaker A:** You're coming to the end of the, uh, uh that part of life.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yes.

**Speaker A:** And, uh, you could say that about 35 would be the top of the hill, uh, and that sexuality kind of slides downhill after that, um, to where sort of, uh, you know that they, they've talked about it in the sense of 7-year cycles. That a child is born and then he doesn't even become sexually active until 6 or 7 years old. And then the next cycle happens when he's 12, 13, 14 years old, and that's when stuff really kicks in. And then 21, and that's marriage age. And then 28, having kids age. And then 35, you're kind of at the peak. Yeah. And going sort of downhill at 42 and then 48 and like that. And so at the end of the cycle, you still have the interest, the curiosity and the desire, but you don't have the equipment anymore. That's why they are selling so much Viagra to old men.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Is to make that change, because we are taught in our society to like it, because the society is ignorant. And yet you can see that over time, over the centuries in fact, that sexuality in the old, old days was much, much more rampant.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Dammarato] Yeah.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Bhikkuni] That rape and incest were common in the Middle Ages and also women dying in childbirth and that children would often die as children. So women would have 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 kids in the hopes that 1 or 2 of them would make it to adulthood.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** OK, so and maybe there wasn't such.

**Speaker B:** Deep planning and deep thinking about it. It just was kind of like, well.

**Speaker A:** This, you know, In other words, humans operated by instinct. Yeah. And only the Buddha and those who were looking at what he was talking about started living their lives with wisdom rather than instinct. And now in modern society, even that, in fact, the medicine— there's another way of looking at it, and that is, is that medical science has been really, really late coming, a really Johnny-come-lately, that we needed medical science thousands of years ago and it didn't show up. Yeah. And so religion said, I'll fill the bill. And so sexuality became an issue of religions to try to make people safe. All right. And one way of staying safe is abstinence, or maybe having only one sexual partner for your whole life. But in fact, in the old days of Judaism and in the time of Jesus and whatnot like that, we talk about old Jewish culture and whatnot. Jewish culture was polygamous. So where did this monogamy come from? The answer is, is that it came from Rome in the early days of Rome, that Rome was kind of like a pirate's cove where there was merely only men. They were robbers, they were thieves, and then they would go hide in the Seven Hills of Rome to escape whatever authorities that the Etruscans and whatnot had. Okay. And so the Romans then would go and steal women. From those other places and bring them back to Rome. So in Rome, what happened was such a shortage of women that if a guy had 4 or 5 women, he got ganged up on and his wives were taken and he was left with knife wounds. And this is how monogamy got started, was that if you've got 2 women, I want one of them. And so monogamy got started in Rome, even though the Romans, even in the time of the emperors, they would always have a miyanoy, which is the Thai word for a second wife. Miyanoy, that means a little wife. Then in fact, the story is in Thailand is, is that the first wife gets the house and the miyanoy gets a car. That's the joke. And mistresses have been common. Of course. And the reason for that is because men could follow that instinctual urge that they had with little consequences, to where women, it was a huge consequence about whose baby is this and all of that kind of stuff. And so medical science has come in, and now we have the morning-after pill, we have abortion pills, we have a huge industry around condoms, vasectomies, all kinds of things that took the reality and the dangers, most of the dangers, out of our desires. For pleasure through sexuality. And so, well, we still have the.

**Speaker B:** Dukkha that it can cause between people and the complications and the jealousy.

**Speaker A:** And that's what we have to start looking at. That's where the Buddha's teachings come in, is never mind all the physical dangers and the physical problems, that in fact, one of the things I think that influenced him a lot was that his mother died within 7 days after he was born, right? And more than likely it was complications from the birth that the story of him coming out and starting to walk immediately has to do with the possibility of him being a breech birth, right?

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Other than the head coming out first, the feet come out first like a I think deer and other animals, they come out feet first.

**Speaker B:** Well, usually I've had sheep before. Usually how they come out is they come out like with their hands like this, and then like they come out that way. But I don't know how it is for other animals.

**Speaker A:** Right. But sometimes they come out feet first. Yeah, back legs. Yeah, back legs come out first. And that, that's often very dangerous for the mother. Yeah, for that to happen. So we have two different kinds of problems. One is the physical problems that medical science has mostly been taking care of, but the emotional side still exists in modern society. Yeah, this is why divorce is over 50% is because they made it easy to have divorce. Yeah, but in fact, one of the statistics is, is that in California during the 1950s, the murder rate was high. A lot of unsolved murders. And then they— then they changed the divorce laws to make divorce easier, prenuptial agreements and all kinds of things, to where in the old days it was community— it was a community, what they call a community property state. And after they changed the laws in the 1950s, the murder rate dropped in half because divorces became possible. You know, the Catholic Church, they didn't want to have people having divorce, and that caused a huge war. I would think that the Catholics' position on sexuality, I mean, it really had something to do with the way that Henry VIII confiscated all the monasteries and literally destroyed Catholicism in England because they didn't like that he was having— but you see, in a way you could say that religion is out of their territory, right? They don't have any say-so about sexuality. What they should stay with is, let us say, finding the kingdom of God within you. Yeah, so that we can in fact have a comfortable, happy life without needing to go for that kind of dangerous entertainment and the attachments and the jealousies and all of that kind of stuff that happens. And so when young men like yourself are getting really into the Dharma, one of the things that we have to keep remembering is how dangerous it still is.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, of course.

**Speaker A:** If you lay a girl, she owns you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, she's gonna run through your head in the meditation, like, that's for sure.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right. She lives in your head, and often she has not just invading your mind without her knowing about it, but she also has you in her mind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Um, and, and so what— so, you.

**Speaker B:** Know, one thing I have a question about— so you often have this thing of saying, I like it but I don't need it, like the Samatha thing. But, right, like, so, so you can have that, but then— and, and like, and I really, like, I really feel that, I experience that, right? And but at the same time— but.

**Speaker A:** I don't want it because it's dangerous, right?

**Speaker B:** Because I see that, you know, and And if it happens, then you go.

**Speaker A:** Back and want it again.

**Speaker B:** It's not even that I want— like, honestly, I don't know if it's that I want it even. It's just, I don't know, if it appears, it appears. If not, if not, is kind of how it's felt for a while for me. But then just in an environment of a monastery, in an environment of, okay, now I for sure can't have it, then it becomes more of a thing for me. Then it becomes more of a— because it's like somebody telling me, like, oh, like, like, you can't have this now. And then they're taking away the candy from the little kid, kind of, you know.

**Speaker A:** But right, but you're looking at it from the wrong direction because you were the one who came to the watch, signed up, right?

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** You were the one who signed up for it. And, uh, often people will, uh, young men will often sign up for that or go live in the Wat because they have seen how dangerous relationships are.

**Speaker B:** Well, and just the world in general. I mean, you just like see it.

**Speaker A:** I saw part of the world out there. Exactly.

**Speaker B:** It's just like, like, what am I doing here? Like, this is such a better environment. Why would I, why would I want, not want to be in an environment like this where I can practice all day?

**Speaker A:** Right. So I don't know. You can also look at the point about modern Western society. I would say more than half of all human behavior is based upon sexuality.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Half of the cars that are purchased are purchased as— Yeah, that's true. All of the makeup, all of the fashion. I mean, can you imagine a fashion show where there was no sexuality involved at all? Right. OK, this is the point, is that we are a society of both looking for pleasure, looking for delights, and also because of the religious background, we're told no. Right. And so we're caught in this bind. Of sexuality, of, oh, I really want it, which is promoted by the society, and, oh, you're not supposed to get it, which is promoted by society. Yeah, catching everybody in a double bind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And here you are even blaming the Watts for it.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I'm not blaming— I'm not blaming the Watts. I'm definitely— I don't want to say that I'm blaming them. It's just more of the Because I realize the logic of that. Obviously when I'm there I realize like, hey, I'm so happy to be here. I'm so thankful that I have an environment where I can be taken care of and it feels wonderful, the compassion everybody has in that environment and the love everybody has. And it's just that's the hindrance that comes up, this story. And then you see it and you're like, ah, that's kind of a silly thought, you know, that you have. So like, we all have these crazy thoughts. You know, when I was sitting there, I had so many crazy thoughts. You know, the number of people that I wanted to just beat up and like get in a fight with that came up in my meditations. Like, I still have some work to do, you know.

**Speaker A:** Well, the work to do is to see those kind of unwholesome thoughts. Yeah. Because they're ignorant. And it goes back to the Second Noble Truth. Of greed, lust, desire, wanting, wanting that car, wanting that money, wanting that house, wanting all of that stuff so that you will be worthy to get that piece of ass. Because that's the bottom line on it. And in fact, that's— you see that in politics a lot. Why do men want power other than the power over other men? To take what they've got, and that women suffer from the same thing. It is built into our genes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And the question is, can you wake up to that? Can you stop seeing your greed ignorantly? Can you stop seeing your aversion ignorantly, like you want to beat that guy up? All right. Right. You're jealous of him. He's got something that you want.

**Speaker B:** I don't know if it's just— it's all— maybe it's, it's holding, it's holding on to the past and holding on to past stories and, and not letting it go, you know?

**Speaker A:** Right. But it's not so much of holding on and letting go, it's ignorantly holding on. Yeah, ignorantly so. So when you see these thoughts come up You have a choice about how you're going to handle it, right? You can either throw it out, modify it, or do something to make life easy rather than something comes up like with the story that you mentioned about Achan Samatha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Instead of it coming up and now we want it, I'm going to disrobe because I want laid. Right. That's the whole thing that happens. In fact, that's what I think is one of the main reasons why Westerners do that. They disrobe because they want to get laid. I've even heard one Thai— actually, he was Laotian— and he was saying that he was going to disrobe because he wants to have a family. Now, that word family, that's the key word. He can't say, I want to go get laid. So he says, well, I want to go have a family, knowing that that stuff is built into our genes. Yeah, it's desire. Okay. And there's a lot of stuff that's built into our genes. Territorial instincts, nesting or herding instincts, the desire for humans to want to get along with each other. Is part of the reason why there's so much warfare. Yeah, it's because of that tension between the nest and the territory and what's outside of the territory. So everything that's in my home, everything that I know, everything that's local, including all of the relationships that I have, are good. And those people who wear turbans are bad. Those people who wear boots like I do are good people, and those who wear slippers are bad, right?

**Speaker B:** So you start to get this separation mindset instead of seeing that it's, you know, all that we're all in the same sort of, you know, thing. We're all dealing with Dukkha, and we're all in the same, same boat here.

**Speaker A:** Except that what's really the point is, is the ignorance of the unknown. Because we do have— and this is built into our genes too— is that predation or predators, if you know where the predator is, you can do something. And if you don't know where the predator is, you're lunch. And so this fear of the unknown also gives rise to people who want to know. Many, many monks, especially Western monks, they read and they read and they read the sutras. They want to know, they want to know, they want to know, instead of recognizing, oh, this is because I want to know. Why don't I just relax and be happy? Yeah, because I'm not going to know enough to relax and be happy. But I can just relax and be happy by seeing this desire to know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, in the monastery, one of the most popular rooms is the library that a lot— you see a lot of the Westerners come and they just sit down and just pour through the books. And yeah, I was kind of like, kind of sitting there like, I don't know if you're gonna find it in there. Like, that's, you know, but it's also— it's how we're conditioned, you know, we're conditioned to have so much stimulus, and then to go to an environment like that, it's shocking for people. And They look for any escape, and the escape is, well, there's a library with a bunch of books, so, you know, there I can find my little thing to hit that box in my mind.

**Speaker A:** Right. That's the entertainment quality. Now, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, by the way, talks about it as he adds it as a requisite. I would actually add a sixth requisite, but the Buddha talked about only four requirements. These are required: just enough food, just enough housing, just enough clothing, and just enough medical care. And yet there's a whole lot of people who are homeless in America who do not have adequate housing. Their clothing is not adequate. They don't have an ability to wash. They don't have any medical attention. So they're in pretty bad shape because they don't have the actual requirements, which are going to be filled for you at the Wat. Yeah, but Bhikkhu Buddhadasa adds the fifth one, and he calls it, uh, wrongly translated I think by Bhante Karo, entertainment. A better way to translate it would be time structuring. We have the requirement of 24 hours a day. How are we going to spend our time, right? Can you spend your time just watching the mind saying, aha, I saw that one? Oh, look at that desire come up. I saw that too. And start having fun at watching how the mind works, right? That's entertainment. It is some of the best entertainment. That's where all the bliss and joy and all that comes from. I know, but we're not in the habit of doing that. We're in the habit of reading books and doing stuff with the internet. In the old days, it was watching television. And all of that kind of stuff is we go there for the entertainment purposes, okay? And the sixth one that I add is transportation, okay? That if you're going to go to the wat, you got to get to the wat.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, of course. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Now, in the time of the Buddha, they had feet, right?

**Speaker B:** You just walk, right?

**Speaker A:** And everything— and because it was local enough, any place that you want to go, you Even if it was a long trip, they would walk a little bit, rest a while, walk some more, camp for the night, get up and start walking for Binduvaad. And after they walk in that direction and gather enough food, they'll stop, they'll eat, rest a while, and then start walking again. This is how Buddhism was spread all over Asia, is by the foot.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that modern times. Sometimes the wats are really far, they're too far for us to walk. Um, so we, we have that requirement. Tainan's going to take a plane trip, then you're going to have to ride on the boat, then you're going to have to take a motorcycle taxi or whatever. But you can, you can get there. But this is something that's, that's required. And that if we can take these things and recognize just enough, just enough food, just enough clothing, just enough housing, and then in fact, in the sutra, by the way, all of this is in the Sabaasava Sutra number 2 in the Majjhima Nikaya, where it actually talks about gadflies and mosquitoes, right? To avoid them, to stay away from the vermin by having adequate housing. Also, when the weather is bad, we need to have protection from the cold and the heat. And so we wear clothing also to protect the private parts, it's mentioned. So this is the mentality. And being married and having a wife Seems like a great big burden. I mean, think about it.

**Speaker B:** I've been married once, so yeah, I know how it is.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And so whenever you go, whenever you travel, look at a big burden. You've got to carry a wife on your shoulders. You got extra luggage to carry. Sometimes she doesn't even want to go on the trip.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** OK, so when you look at it from the inconvenience of these requisites, This is part of our waking up to recognize that it's not actually the act of sex that is the issue. It's all of the equipment and burdens and feelings and all of that that go with it. And that one One point is, is that most of the people who were really close to the Buddha followed him, listened to what he had to say, did not ordain.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** That they stayed as what is normally referred to as householders. But another way of looking at it is the ones who had property, the caste that he came from. Were wealthy. And that the story would go is that the wealthy guy doesn't have to join the Sangha and go live in the woods with the poor guys who don't have any other choice, but he could sit on the porch of his— or piazza of his plantation and let his wife and all the employees or maybe servants, or maybe slaves, do everything for him, and he can sit there and just enjoy his life, meditate, or practice Anapanasati, practice being happy with what happens rather than being angry when things don't go the way that he wants to go. And so it's not necessarily that you have to ordain in order to follow the practice of the Buddha. No, but, uh, it depends upon one's circumstances. And always— well, and it's— and when.

**Speaker B:** One— better kind of freedom— it's hard to create the circumstance in the, in the lay world. I mean, I've been trying to create circumstances for good practice. It's hard to find other people to be around. It's hard to create the circumstances. It's not as— it's pretty easy to go to a monastery or a wat and it's already set up for you, you know, like for a condition for practice. I practice at home and it's great and I'm very happy with my life, but there's still this factor of you're around other people who are not there and then you can try to spread your joy to them, but you're like a lone warrior.

**Speaker A:** That's what we're doing on the Skype. That's what the Discord is for. Yeah, yeah. Let's start having some noble friends. I invite you to start posting to start reading. And that in fact, the website that we've got, the Open Sangha Foundation, the primary word is Sangha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, of course.

**Speaker A:** Let's have community. That's why we have the comments and the messages system and the emailing is so that we can stay in touch with one another to where most websites, in fact almost all the websites that I've ever seen, whoever did the website, whatever organization, their website is about that organization only.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So, uh, a different example would be places like, uh, Goset or BuddhaNet actually have a list of all of the Wats, but that's all that they have is you go there, you get the, uh, the URL for the Wat, and now you go read that Wat page. But this is set up for community, so that people can find teachers, people can find student friends, they can find Watts to go to, they can find centers, whatever it is. And so, it's a different kind of website. It's not selling anything. It's a community site for people to join together, something like in a way LinkedIn, except that LinkedIn is all about getting a job. It's an ordinary kind of site. This is the only one that I know of that has the spiritual quality of LinkedIn, where we can link in with others to have the friends. And so I invite you to take advantage of that, because you're actually here complaining that all the people that you deal with are ordinary people that are having ordinary worries.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, and I do communicate with people online. I mean, still within like the Sangha. I mean, I haven't been actively participating as much, but I still have a group of people that I talk to online. But it's a little bit different talking online and in real life. But you are right that that is a resource that we have. I mean, thankfully we have that because we have something going on that helps to keep us on the path.

**Speaker A:** So we have better options than just going to get laid.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, of course. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And yet that's what the whole society is built upon, that. And that there's another point that needs to actually be stated, and that is, is that it's mostly mental, the pride of getting laid. Oh, I want her. And now I've got her and all of that.

**Speaker B:** But the action— it's never sad, it's never satisfying though.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's not satisfying. As soon as you get laid, yeah, you want to go to sleep.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And then the next day you're out looking for more.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And as soon as you get that, that girl, that prize, you then you're like, oh well, okay, uh, that wasn't, you know, that also wasn't the solution, you know. Like, that's, that's not the That we're all not filling the hole in my heart. I have to figure out something else to write.

**Speaker A:** I have a hole in my heart and I— and it is shaped like that girl.

**Speaker B:** That's what our mind thinks anyways.

**Speaker A:** And the Christians keep saying, no, that hole in your heart is God-shaped, that God will fit right in. But guess what? God keeps falling out of that hole. And now they're looking for the girl that's in the choir to fill that hole. Okay. And the real point is, is that we need to have that hole inside left empty.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Because that gives us space and freedom. If we have that hole inside and we try to throw a truck in there and a motorcycle and a bicycle and a skate board and a whole wardrobe. It gets crowded in there and there's not a lot of room and we're still not satisfied with it. So we're now we're trying to stuff the girl into that hole and it never fills and it never feels secure. Yeah. And so leaving that hole inside is the right way to go and find that in that hole is great Freedom. Yeah, we have freedom.

**Speaker B:** Well, then you have the freedom to actually love everybody, you know. Like, the thing that I notice when I actually get connected to it is I stop seeing one individual person and what I want out of them, and I can instead radiate loving kindness to everyone I see, no matter what age they are, no matter how old they are, no matter how fat they are, ugly, or anything. You're like, it's so— they're lovely, you know. And, and that's— but you have to.

**Speaker A:** Have that, that in that hole, that emptiness actually becomes a home, so that we feel at home. When we feel at home and free, that's the source of the loving-kindness, the friendship, the generosity, is because we've learned to love ourselves, we've learned to be at home ourselves, we've learned to nurture ourselves. Rather than being critical, that our society is built upon criticism. Children are taught to be critical. We even place up at a high standard of critical thinking, right? Critical thinking means to take stuff apart and find out what's wrong with it, etc., like that, instead of accepting the things the way that they are. To be able to love yourself, warts and all, means that now that you're friendly with your warts, you can actually investigate them and make choices about them. But if you hate them and push them away, then we begin to lie to ourselves. We're in denial. Oh, that's— I don't have that wart. Yeah, because I don't want the girls to see that wart. Yeah, I gotta hide that wart. I gotta lie about that wart. Okay. And so if we can be nurturing to ourselves instead of critical. Yeah, that's when we get that comfort level that we're okay as we are. We're satisfied with the way life is. And now we're not actually out there looking for either that chick magnet car or that magic pussy or the silver bullet or whatever it is that we're looking for because we don't have that wholeness inside. Because it's full of cars and bicycles and motorbikes and skateboards and an occasional girl that goes in and comes back out and is never complete, never satisfied.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so I still have the question that pops up of, but what, like, the physical aspect of this too, of you go from being sexually active to then cutting off sexuality when you're in an environment like that.

**Speaker A:** Guess what? Don't cut it off. But rather distract. And we can distract.

**Speaker B:** But it's not even a mental thing of just more the physical part of your body where you feel physical changes in your body. If you go from being a sexually active person— Yeah, you get horny, right?

**Speaker A:** The body, I mean, you wake up in the morning with a hard-on. Your balls get super large and you're.

**Speaker B:** Like, what is going on? Like, this is— I haven't felt this in a long time. This is really strange, you know? And then the day progresses and it's fine, but you wake up and it's just different. Because I mean, I haven't experienced that in a long time, you know.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, instead of making it bad or wrong and worrying about it, the better thing to do is become distracted.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Now when that thing happens, yeah, speak of it like that. When that thing happens, we can start thinking about something else.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so what, what I was doing is like, you know, you wake up at 4:30 in the morning, and so I was like, well, I go meditate now, you know. And like, obviously you're not going to go into the meditation hall with a hard-on and sit there, you know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but going to the meditation hall, on the way there, it's not going to be so hard.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** Because you're thinking about it being a hard-on.

**Speaker B:** No, I know. And so that's what I mean, is like, when like it immediately, it itself because you get up out of bed, you start putting your clothes on, and then you're like, oh, well, now I go about my day. And then— and it seemed to repeat like that, you know, that seemed to be kind of how it was going.

**Speaker A:** The reality is there's nothing to it. Yeah, that this is something that comes out of our DNA, and it comes up when we're asleep. Possibly it's because we're having sexual dreams. Yeah, but we can distract ourselves, and by getting out of bed and getting dressed and going to the meditation hall, and it's going to be limp by the time you get there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, of course.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, unless you're thinking about it. Yeah, yeah, that is in fact all mental. Almost all human sexuality is mental.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I've realized, I've had that realization like for sure. Yeah, because if I've tried having sex mindfully and I found that I was like, this is actually really not enjoyable, like to be really mindful of the whole experience and not make any noises or anything, you're like is actually kind of strange. Like, you know, it's all in the storyline that I'm putting around it and the context.

**Speaker A:** Right, and the storyline is that, oh, I want her, oh, I've got to have her, oh, this is all— I.

**Speaker B:** Need to please her, I need to be this guy that can just like sweep her off her feet, and I need to act like this and feel like this. No, I have to feel my heart. And like all this storyline, that's where the feeling comes from. But the actual physical sensation, it's like anything else, like touching your arm or something.

**Speaker A:** You know. It's like, yeah, it's not really a big deal. There's nothing much to it. Nothing much to it. It's all mental. We make it a big deal mentally. And so if you can distract yourself, and we can say it— in fact, there's two ways to distract ourselves. The first one we've just talked about, of just changing the subject. But the other one is actually more powerful, and that has the quality of, this is not me, this is not mine. The body is doing that all by itself, and it's not my body, it's just a body.

**Speaker B:** And it's a body that's been conditioned for 35 years to think a certain way, and we're trying to condition it in a different way.

**Speaker A:** You have to change that to say, hey, that's Not me. I'm okay. I'm probably even better off without it. Yeah, but I can deal with it. It's just one of the warts. So now we begin to see it all. It's just a wart that comes up from time to time.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And there's nothing to it. But if we go back to that societal thing, oh, you've got to get married, or oh, you, you, you need a family. Oh, you need to be fulfilled. Or children are the most enjoyable aspects of life. That's the biggest lie that there's ever told.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** That, oh, you're going to get all your joy from kids. And yet every young man has a fight with his dad all through his teen years because the dad wants to get the pleasure from his son and the son wants to get away from his dad. Not give the dad pleasure by doing what dad tells you to do. That almost all dads want to live vicariously through their sons. Yeah, my dad wanted me to play tuba, so I played tuba. Yeah, it took me a long time to figure out that I'm playing tuba because my dad wants me to play tuba. I've got better things to do. I can tinker with a ham radio set, and I can play with electronics. I Yeah. And so that's the whole point, was, is that our dads, our family, influence us almost always big deal, and almost always in unwholesome ways, that all the bad habits that dad had, he wants to give you.

**Speaker B:** Well, I don't know if he wants to, but he's just ignorant.

**Speaker A:** No, no, he wants to ignorantly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so I'm saying, yeah, he's ignorantly like, you know, I mean, I picked it up. I started drinking because Dad comes home from work and has a six-pack of beer. That's what you do. So that's how I started living my early 20s. And then it took a long time to be like, oh wow, this probably isn't that wise to do this.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. So you're getting a little bit deeper into it. And that's exactly the right way to look at it, is that you can examine how much pleasure is it that in fact going for dates is a lot of work.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Oh, it's a lot of work. You got to go shopping for clothes and you got to go to the barber and you got to go do this and go do that and buy some expensive stink or something like that. Got to have good wheels. You got to impress her. And you're— and now the girls, so I hear, is that they all want 10s. They don't want a guy who is a 7 or an 8. And in fact, Scott and I were talking about this not long ago, to where he is beautiful, he is handsome, he is strong, he is a sportsman, he's into water sports. He is an ideal pick, except that he's got no money. And so instead of being— he lives in California.

**Speaker B:** Well, if he's in the right environment, that doesn't— that's not a hindrance either, because you just got to be around a bunch of hippies, and then they think it's an advantage if you don't have any money. Because I'm in that situation too. And it's, you know, people like that because they're like, oh wow, you like, you follow your dreams and you like, you're into spirituality. You just have to find the right type of girls that are into that. But he's in California, so it's different.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's also what he's like, state of mind also.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but what are you searching for too? It's like, you know, I mean Yeah, you keep searching for this perfect person, but I mean, and for me, I've kind of gotten to the point where it's like, well, I meet these people and it's nice hanging out with them, but I really don't want to have to go through all of the garbage that you described of, yeah, it's a lot of work, you know, and what's the end here? Like, the end is the same. I'm going to end up dying, you know, and I'm going to end up being you know, pain from the separation of this relationship, from somebody dying. Like, that's the end, you know. And I can enjoy it. I can enjoy being around this person, but the same way I can enjoy meeting you, can enjoy meeting other friends. And, you know, there's no difference.

**Speaker A:** Well, this is why I talk about it in the sense that your genes are playing a trick on you. They want you to want sexuality because that's the way that the species is propagated. But it makes every one of us miserable.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** That in fact, the population has about hit its peak and we could do quite well with a whole lot fewer people. But look, our entire economy is built upon growth.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And things are not going to keep growing.

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker A:** Women are not going to have so many babies because they have the power. They're taking their power back from men.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so a lot of girls are not— I mean, I can see a time when Revlon and Max Factor go out of business. Girls don't have to paint their face anymore because they're not out shopping for guys, right? That they found something that they can do with their lives that is entertaining, and sexuality is not so important. And with that, having babies, they've got better things to do with their time. That having children has been taught for so long that the best things in life have to do with having kids. And everybody can see that, hey, man.

**Speaker B:** Well, you can still be around kids, you know. I mean, like, you're around kids. And I mean, on the farm that I live on, there's kids that are next door. They come over and we cook together and it's great. I love being around them, but then they go back home and then they go back home, you know, like I get to, you know, so I get the— to me I'm like, oh, this is great, this is great, because it's nice being around kids, right? It's, it's, it's also— you can get extreme with it and it can be— I meet a lot of 40-year-olds that I'm like, they're only around like 35, 40-year-olds and they're not around old people, they're not around young people, they're not— and I don't know. There's also that extreme that people have been going to in our society where there's a separation. You're not around kids at all, you know.

**Speaker A:** Right. There's that other thing, and that is that Granny wants kids.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Granddaughter's got to have kids so that Granny has a baby to play with.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that, in fact, that's one of the problems with our society. They should put daycare and children's facilities in old folks' homes.

**Speaker B:** I know, it's crazy. It's like, you know, all these old people are lonely, and then you have all these parents who don't want to raise kids, and you're like, put these two groups together, that'd be great.

**Speaker A:** So that the elderly can give their little kids some wisdom that they've gotten over time.

**Speaker B:** I know, it's crazy. It's so crazy. There's such a loneliness in old people, it's just crazy. It's Oh my God, that is something I haven't really thought about that, but that's totally true.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So in fact, you're pointing out that kids are not the joy that they're cracked up to be.

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker A:** For the young dude, that in fact it will interfere with his desires, it'll interfere with his spiritual life, all kinds of things. Are going on with that. And so when we begin to wake up to it, we can see that all society is changing. As society wakes up, the population is going to go down. Yeah, because of the education, the understanding, as well as having access to good medical care. And with those two things, both the physical and the emotional changes The population is going to start having some big demographic shifts. It's already happening. It's happening in Japan, is happening in Russia. It's happened in China, but that was because of the one-child policy and everything. But it's happening in India. The World Health Organization has actually had quite a lot to do because in India 50 years ago, every woman had 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 kids. Now It's under 3 and going down. And why is that? Because the women are waking up to, wait a minute, I am not the baby factory that I've been trained to be. I want to be something better than that. And with that idea, we're going to have a much more liberated population and more happiness is going to be coming if we can get people into the noble Sangha. Otherwise it's going to be skateboards and flying helicopters. And isn't it dangerous, though, to think.

**Speaker B:** That more happiness is going to be coming? Because isn't that the storyline that we've been having for like 2,600 years of like, if we can just get people, then more happiness is going to come?

**Speaker A:** And that's the whole point, is that happiness never comes because everybody's looking for happiness in all the wrong places.

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** There's a song like that, is looking for love in all the wrong places, because they're out there looking around instead of looking at the real place that they're going to have the happiness.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I know. And yeah, it's, it's so hard to explain this to people. Well, you know, I've been trying to tell them about my experience at the monastery, and it's— if you haven't experienced it, then you just don't know, you know. And it's— you're not— no amount of explaining in words is gonna do anything.

**Speaker A:** But well, you know, teaching of the Buddha is subtle and it's profound, but basically the reason for it is because it sets upright that which has been overturned in our society. And so everybody is sitting on furniture, mental furniture, that's upside down. Yeah, and they're used to having springs on their butt rather than having a nice cushion to sit on. And so that's why the Buddha Dharma is not being well received, but it will when AI and when robotics and when all of the jobs are gone, people and Christianity dies off. In fact, Christianity dying out is one of the major influences of why Buddhism is on the rise in the world.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, of course. Yeah. Well, people are still looking for something, you know.

**Speaker A:** And it's possible to find it through the teachings of the Buddha.

**Speaker B:** Right, and it's actually something you can do and you don't have to just rely on blind faith. Actually, when I was at the monastery, I met a guy who was raised Catholic and he was like, "Yeah, I lost my faith and I realized there was no faith there and then I just came to something where it said you didn't have to have faith as a prerequisite," and I thought, "That sounds really good." And faith actually builds, you know, because I have faith in the practice because of practicing, because I see the results in myself and I see the results in others.

**Speaker A:** But that's not faith.

**Speaker B:** Faith is— Saddha, or whatever the word is.

**Speaker A:** Well, yeah, Shraddha.

**Speaker B:** Shraddha.

**Speaker A:** But it's confidence in the fact that you can do something for yourself. You see, that's the problem with atheism, is when they throw God out, they throw everything that's good about Christianity out.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And they— and many people get really angry at Christianity, having been raised in Christianity, and they've become so disappointed with it that now that they're stuck, but they still have magical beliefs. And so a lot of the magic, magical beliefs is what Buddhism is founded upon in the West. A lot of it is magical thinking, but at least they're coming in the right direction of getting— coming out of the rules, out of the rituals, out of the magical stories of Christianity into something that actually works. That Christianity teaches that you're broken, you've got an original sin, that you need Jesus. If you don't— the story is you don't— if you don't have that plastic Jesus on the dashboard of your truck you're going to wreck that truck. That's the story of Christianity. And the atheists are beginning to say, wait a minute, I can have a better life without any of that stuff. But they're still in misery. They're still unhappy. But there is still that wanting, that desiring. And so people are going to be looking around. And finding that there are better things that they can do.

**Speaker B:** So I have a question that came up about the magical thinking thing. So about the feeling of— it's quick because I know we've been talking a long time— and this is going— how can I word this? So there's a feeling that there are synchronicities happening, and I realize that that's magical thinking, and I see that it's magical.

**Speaker A:** Oh no. Oh no, actually waking up, you see more and more and more simultaneousness.

**Speaker B:** That's what I mean, is I'm seeing it and I'm accepting that.

**Speaker A:** It's real when you see it.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** There is coincidences.

**Speaker B:** Right, that's what I'm saying. And I don't ask why it's happening, but there's too many where it's just like, this is too crazy. Like, this can't, it's not possible. Like, you know, I'm a mathematical person. I know the odds of this happening. It's not, you know, it doesn't work.

**Speaker A:** Except that the point is, is that as you're practicing more correctly, you're waking up and seeing what's going on, and you're beginning to see the wholeness of reality, that we're all together. And part of the evidence of that is all this synchronicity stuff that happens, all of the simultaneous— why is that happening? Mathematically, it should not be if everything is random. But the fact is, things are not random.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Okay.

**Speaker A:** That noise is random. And we're learning to play music. We're learning to get in harmony with things. And that's when we begin to see the harmony of things. For instance, earlier today I was talking to Robert. And the thought occurred to me about Cat, and I started talking about Cat, and Cat's rolling right in. That was just another example of synchronicity. Yeah, you know, why did I have him on my mind? Why did he come into my mind immediately right then? Because he was in the process of coming into the yard. That's why he came to mind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** But I didn't see him until after I'd mentioned it to it, uh, to Robert.

**Speaker B:** So this is that really warms my heart because I was scared to ask you because I was like, oh, I'm feeling this so much, but he's going to just say it's magical thinking. And yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So no, the magical thinking is that there is magic in there. The fact is, is that it's real. If we can start to recognize that we're influenced, that we are not the separate entity that our society has been teaching us, that you're all alone and you're going to have to learn to deal with society to get out of it what you want. And the reality is, is that, oh no, we're all in this together.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And you can see that togetherness.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Oh, so many times on these videos that we're talking about, I got several that I remember. One was is that I started to talk about a Piti a particular piece of music, and the girl says, "We were playing it last night, it's sitting right here on the turntable." Another example was that I started talking about a profession, about dishwashers, and the guy that I'm talking to turns out to be— and it blew him away— because he's a professional dishwasher. And so it just happens on a regular basis, and I think that it has to do with the fact that we get in tune. And as you get in tune, all kinds of synchronicities happen.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Serendipity is even a better word. I like serendipity a whole lot better than synchronicity because synchronicity has a kind of a scientific, a false scientific quality to it, rather than just coincidental or serendipity. Oh yeah, I mean, we live actually in a kind of a way, a really magical environment. We live in a paradise where everything fits together. I know. So notice that, enjoy it, rather than worry about it and become afraid about it. Yeah. So let's finish the talk now because I've actually got another call coming in about 30 minutes and I need to rest.

**Speaker B:** But yeah, of course.

**Speaker A:** Joe, I am so happy to see you again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, me too. I'm so happy also.

**Speaker A:** Call more often. Okay. And get in with our Sangha. We've got so many people who you could meet and be friends with.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Thank you so much, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** Really appreciate it.

**Speaker A:** Do some commenting and send some messages on the website also.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I will do that for sure. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. We'll see. Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato with Sangha friend Joe, centers on navigating sexuality as a lay practitioner within a monastic setting and the broader context of the Buddha's teachings. Here is a summary of the key themes and advice:

### **Core Theme: Sexuality as a Genetic & Societal "Trick"**
Dhammarato frames sexual desire as a deep, instinctual drive programmed into our DNA for species propagation. Society and culture then amplify this "trick" by heavily promoting sexuality (through advertising, fashion, social norms) while simultaneously imposing religious or moral restrictions, creating a confusing "double bind."

### **Key Insights and Advice:**

1.  **Recognize the "Hole" and the Burden:** The perpetual sense of lack or a "hole in the heart" that we try to fill with relationships, possessions, or experiences is misguided. True freedom and loving-kindness come from **leaving that hole empty**, creating internal space and self-sufficiency. Relationships, while potentially enjoyable, come with significant burdens (emotional, logistical, financial).

2.  **Distraction and "Not Me, Not Mine":** When strong physical urges arise (e.g., in a monastery), the primary tools are:
    *   **Distraction:** Simply change your activity and focus. Getting up and starting the day's routine naturally dissipates the energy.
    *   **Anatta (Not-Self):** Observe the urge with the understanding, **"This is not me, this is not mine."** See it as a conditioned, bodily process—a "wart"—rather than a personal failing or essential need.

3.  **The Shift from Instinct to Wisdom:** Human history shows we often operated on instinct, leading to danger and dukkha (suffering). The Buddha's path is about replacing ignorant instinct with wise reflection. Modern medicine has reduced the *physical* dangers of sexuality (STDs, pregnancy), but the **emotional dukkha**—attachment, jealousy, complication, heartbreak—remains. This is where Dhamma practice is essential.

4.  **Critique of Societal Narratives:** The talk deconstructs common societal pressures:
    *   **The "Need" for Family/Children:** Framed as a potential lie that can interfere with spiritual growth and personal freedom.
    *   **The "Pride" of Sexuality:** Much of the pleasure is mental and social (conquest, status) rather than purely physical.
    *   **Monogamy's Origins:** Presented not as a sacred ideal but as a historical development arising from social and economic circumstances (e.g., scarcity in ancient Rome).

5.  **Creating Supportive Conditions:** Joe notes the difficulty of practicing as a "lone warrior" in the lay world. Dhammarato emphasizes the importance of **Sangha (community)**. He promotes using online platforms and networks to find "noble friends" for support, creating a middle way between full monastic immersion and isolated lay practice.

6.  **Synchronicity as a Sign of Harmony:** In a final segment, they discuss the increase of meaningful coincidences (synchronicity) with deeper practice. Dhammarato reframes this not as "magical thinking" but as a natural result of **waking up and coming into harmony with reality**. As one's mind becomes clearer and more attuned, the interconnectedness of all things becomes more apparent.

### **Conclusion & Practical Takeaway:**
The talk encourages practitioners to:
*   **Investigate their desires** with wisdom, not guilt.
*   **See through the societal and genetic conditioning** around sexuality.
*   **Cultivate internal freedom and self-love** as the foundation for true happiness.
*   **Use practical Dhamma tools** (distraction, anatta reflection) to manage urges.
*   **Seek out and contribute to a supportive spiritual community.**

The ultimate goal is not repression, but understanding—freeing oneself from the ignorant pursuit of pleasure in ways that cause suffering, and finding a deeper, more reliable peace and joy within.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors and stories** to explore the themes of sexuality, desire, monastic life, and spiritual practice. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **Key Metaphors**

1. **DNA / Instinct Playing a “Dirty Trick”**  
   - Speaker A describes sexual desire as a “dirty trick” played by our DNA or evolutionary instincts. The metaphor frames sexuality as a biological mechanism for species propagation that creates mental and emotional suffering.

2. **The “Hole in the Heart”**  
   - Speaker A uses the metaphor of a “hole in the heart” that people try to fill with relationships, possessions, or experiences. He argues that true freedom comes from leaving that hole empty rather than stuffing it with temporary satisfactions.

3. **Life as a “7-Year Cycle”**  
   - Speaker A describes human life in cycles of seven years (childhood, puberty, marriage, parenting, peak at 35, decline). This metaphor frames sexual drive as tied to biological and social timing.

4. **Monastic Life as a “Better Environment”**  
   - Both speakers contrast the “world” (chaotic, desire-driven) with the monastery (structured, supportive). The wat is metaphorically a refuge or “better environment” for practice.

5. **Sexuality as “Dangerous Entertainment”**  
   - Speaker A refers to sexuality as “dangerous entertainment,” comparing it to a risky pastime that can lead to attachment, jealousy, and suffering.

6. **Thoughts as “Warts”**  
   - Speaker A suggests accepting unwanted thoughts or desires like “warts”—something to acknowledge and investigate rather than hate or hide.

7. **Society’s “Double Bind”**  
   - Speaker A describes modern society as caught in a double bind: it promotes sexual desire through media and advertising while also imposing religious or moral restrictions.

---

### **Stories and Anecdotes**

1. **Historical Shift to Monogamy**  
   - Speaker A tells a story about ancient Rome, where a shortage of women led to monogamy as a social compromise. This illustrates how social structures around sexuality are culturally constructed, not innate.

2. **Henry VIII and the Catholic Church**  
   - Speaker A references Henry VIII’s break from Catholicism over divorce laws, highlighting how religious institutions have tried to regulate sexuality, often with political consequences.

3. **Buddha’s Birth Story**  
   - Speaker A mentions the Buddha’s mother dying after childbirth, possibly due to a breech birth. This story is used to illustrate the physical dangers and dukkha (suffering) associated with birth and sexuality.

4. **Modern Medicine and Sexual Safety**  
   - Speaker A contrasts past risks (women dying in childbirth, high infant mortality) with modern contraception and medical advances, arguing that while physical dangers have decreased, emotional suffering remains.

5. **The “Miyanoy” (Minor Wife) Joke**  
   - Speaker A shares a Thai joke about the first wife getting the house and the second wife getting a car, highlighting cultural attitudes toward infidelity and marriage.

6. **California Divorce Law Changes**  
   - Speaker A recounts how easier divorce laws in 1950s California reduced murder rates, suggesting that legal flexibility can decrease violence rooted in sexual jealousy.

7. **Personal Anecdotes from the Monastery**  
   - Speaker B shares his experience of heightened sexual desire in the monastery, framing it as a reaction to prohibition (“taking candy from a kid”).

8. **Synchronicity/Serendipity Stories**  
   - Toward the end, both speakers discuss experiences of meaningful coincidence (e.g., thinking of someone just as they arrive). Speaker A frames this as evidence of interconnectedness, not “magical thinking.”

---

### **Overall Rhetorical Purpose**
These metaphors and stories serve to:
- **Normalize** the struggle with sexual desire in spiritual practice.
- **Contextualize** sexuality within biological, historical, and social frameworks.
- **Contrast** instinct-driven behavior with wisdom-based living (Buddha’s teaching).
- **Encourage** a shift from seeking external satisfaction to finding internal freedom.

The dialogue uses vivid, relatable imagery to make abstract Dharma teachings concrete, especially around the Second Noble Truth (cause of suffering) and the practice of mindful observation.
