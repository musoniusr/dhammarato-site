### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Is a decision to not know about something that is irrelevant, right?

**Speaker B:** So, oh, okay. Um, that's actually quite valuable, um, in the topic of what's the difference between wise ignorance and foolish ignorance. Would be when you're wise to the ignorance, as opposed to foolishly not wise to the ignorance. Or you may not know, but you know that you don't know it. To where somebody who doesn't know that they don't know will either make up something or quote somebody who's made up something, right? But it is actually against the society that we live in to not know, and it's okay to not know. That in fact, when that's done in court, the people who do that are very suspicious. Almost guilty by stupidity. Oh, I've forgotten all about it. Oh, I don't remember, Your Honor. That kind of thing. Okay, so in our society, we're supposed to know that in fact the questions in the old days at universities and high school and whatnot were almost always essay, or in mathematics you had to show the work. But nowadays the education has changed into it's okay to guess, and we have multiple choices. Even in the math, they give you multiple choices, right? So coming to an answer, coming to a conclusion, as it were, jumping to a conclusion, is in fact promoted in our society. Jumping to a conclusion, no matter what cesspool you land in, is okay so long as you jump. And a whole lot of looking before relief doesn't happen. So it's okay to guess on these tests. It's okay to make something up as an answer. And it's kind of not okay to say, I don't know. There's something wrong with us if we don't have an opinion. But in fact, it's almost to the point that opinions have become valuable rather than an opinion is an admission of ignorance. Okay, just play with my fans here for a minute. So So this is really an important point about, um, the Second Noble Truth is what kind of ignorance are we talking about? Are we talking about wise ignorance? Are we talking about foolish ignorance? But in fact, um, uh, Parker just pointed out, by listening to a tape from some esteemed white The Pali word Chanda. Now, I knew that Chanda was the groom that the Buddha brought with him when he brought a horse when he left home. But the word Chanda actually has to do with this wise ignorance. Okay, and the wisdom also is a quality that we have to use, actually as a substitute for fear. That fear has been keeping us alive. Fear is the natural understanding of danger. If we practice to take control over that instinct of fear, then we need wisdom as a substitution so that we can avoid being in danger rather than having to be in danger and begin to know that you're in danger because you feel it as fear and feeling of danger. So we actually begin to use the wisdom to figure out how to create safety. We use the wisdom to figure out how things are going, the direction they're going in, the trajectory that they're taking. We never know what the outcome is going to be. But if I do know that if somebody shoots the direction of, uh, you're so ignorant, you don't know anything about the Pali— if he's shooting bullets in that direction and I go stand in that direction, then I'll stand as a target and let him hit me, and then I'll feel bad. It's me he's talking about. But with wisdom, and I see that trajectory going over there, I can say, 'Ha, it missed me.' I can stand out of the way of— I don't have to get hit with the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune because I recognize them through wisdom, rather than having to suffer up through them stupidly. And so this is back then to the issue of wise ignorance. My little story you probably heard of— imagine that you got up in the middle of the night and it's really, really black. You don't turn light on because you know your way to the bathroom, and so you go to the bathroom, but on the way you stub your toe. Now, did you stub your toe out of ignorance or out of delusion?

**Speaker A:** Ignorance.

**Speaker B:** No, you stubbed the toe out of delusion. The ignorance was, is that I know my way to the bathroom, but that's not real ignorance. That's not wise ignorance, that's foolish ignorance, that's delusion, because I think I know my way to the bathroom. I think I know where the furniture is. Wise ignorance would turn the light on. Wise ignorance would say, "I do not know my way to the bathroom this time," and turn the light on. Why is that? We don't know, but we do know that in this scenario, The guy got his toe stumped because he thought he knew his way to the toilet. How many times do we wind up in Dukkha, in unsatisfactory situations, including arguments, because we stumped our toe on the way to a conversation?

**Speaker A:** Metaphorically, all kinds of times.

**Speaker B:** Oh, that's all. That's it, right? We think we know, rather than recognizing that maybe I don't know, and maybe if I don't know, it's better to keep my mouth shut, right? Rather than thinking we know something and somebody thinks they know something else, and off we go into an argument. Now, the funny thing about actual knowledge, actual wisdom would be that the person who really actually does know generally doesn't want to argue with people who want to argue over the point, because they're deluded about what they know. And you can take any subject about that where the exasperated one will say, well, just go look it up, I'm not even bothering to work with you. But two people who think they know and are delusional will argue with each other over who's right and who's wrong. Now, take it out of a fact, that we're not talking about a factoid, we're talking about the way people feel. But that's where the arguments generally happen, is because you don't feel the way that you feel according to your criteria for feeling that way. You feel the way that I think that you ought to feel based upon the criteria that I make up. And so that's where the sorts of arguments happen, is at an emotional level. But it sounds like that they're fighting over facts. A good example of that would be in either Manchester or Liverpool— you take your choice of the city— and walk into a bar there. And in Manchester, you're for you know, the teams, they visit each other, all right? And so my team is better than your team, and now you've got a brawl. But Liverpool goes to Manchester and with the attitude of my team is better than yours, okay? So actually, now we can take the soccer out of it and put any topic you want to in it. That my dog's better than your dog, my ideas, my opinions. And in that regard, neither one of them have any basis of fact. They can't prove it and walk away. Even though they've got no evidence to show. And that's what knowledgeable people have, is they've got something very, very curious. It's called evidence. In fact, on an unrecorded call earlier with Parker, we were talking about that also, in the sense that Particle physicists and physicists in general know what they know about physics because of the experiments, and they have spent huge amounts of money on places like CERN and gravitational instruments and all that kind of stuff because they're looking for evidence. And yet most of what we know about particle physics is just opinion. We don't have any evidence of a gluon. We don't even have real evidence of a proton. We think we do, but we really don't have much evidence of particle physics, just like the Christians don't have any real evidence about their heavens and hells and trinities and Mother Jesus and Anagami, uh, sons of God, and all of that stuff. They don't have any evidence. The difference between the Christians and the physicists is the physicists are desperate for evidence, and the Catholics, they don't want any because the evidence is more than likely going to prove them wrong, and they know that. So they don't want any evidence. Where the physicists, they don't mind being wrong, they really want to know the facts. Now, in a way, what we're talking about here is Dhamma. That's what the investigation, right view, is all about. It's less get some evidence. Let's go find out what's in the mind. Let's go look at it very carefully. Let's go inspect it over time as it changes and modifies. We'll begin to get a really good handle on what's going on within this thing that we call a human. And so in a way, you'd say that Well, psychology doesn't even want you to do that. They don't want you to really do that kind of an investigation. They would rather you pay the psychologist so that the psychologist tells you. Don't have to do your own investigation. And so this is what the real Dharma is about. It's about that ignorance. Can we figure out what our delusions are and change that to wise ignorance? And then to do the investigations that we need to figure out what actions we can take that are useful, valuable, and wholesome. Or, as we've talked, that poem that the AA uses is actually quite brilliant Dhamma, and that is: God grant me the courage to do the things that I can do, and the serenity to accept the things that I cannot do. And the wisdom to know the difference. Now, good little Buddhist boy, we want to play with some of the words in there, clean up the act, take out the word courage because that's not what we need. Uh, but let us say then that wisdom is the whole point, is to accept the world as it is, knowing that we can't change it, but that we can change and influence the little world that we actually live in. And that's the wisdom, is to see what we can do, rather than being all protesting and uptight and critical of the things that we actually can't change. In that regard, all we can do is just enjoy the show.

**Speaker A:** I have a question on that.

**Speaker B:** Wouldn't you say— Absolutely, been waiting on it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so wouldn't you say some protest is valuable? You know, like say, had there never been a march, you know, Martin Luther King's march or Gandhi's marches, you know, Mandela, etc. You would have a lot less freedom, politically and legally at least.

**Speaker B:** We could go so far as to say that much of what's happening in the politics of the United States goes under the banner that the loser wants revenge. And the champion wants rest. And you see that played out at every election, okay? Especially the midterms. Whoever the new president is in one party, the other party will probably take over the Congress or whatever during midterms, right? That's very common. Common knowledge. They're expecting something strange this year because of the ongoing situation with Donald Trump. He won't shut his mouth. If he'd have kept his mouth shut and walked away, then the Republicans would have been in really outstanding shape, because each one of the Republicans has that mentality of wanting revenge. Okay, if you can understand that revenge is the primary motivating factor in politics. Let's go now and look at the Civil War. There was a whole lot of revenge that broke away the South, and then a whole lot of revenge after the war, including the Ku Klux Klan and Jim Crow and all of that kind of stuff. And then, they lost it again with Roosevelt, because they lost control of the unions in a way. They also lost control in World War II. But the big one was a century later, after the Civil War, when the Civil Rights Movement came in, and they lost again. They're still fighting that same war, and they don't like losing. You see that in sports sometimes, that a team will have a losing streak. And what happens with that losing streak is the more years they lose in a row, the harder the core of their fans become. It's smaller. But it's hardcore. That's what's happening with the politics today, is that there is a very, very hardcore group of people who want revenge because they've lost every battle in every war that they've engaged in since the big one. And I don't like it a little bit, and they want to regain their country and make it great again. And they want to keep their guns because they think that that's what it's going to take, but I don't think so. But anyway, my opinion, just my opinion, who knows what's going to happen. But we do know that much of the politics everywhere is based upon revenge and getting even because the other team won and we lost. We got to go get our honor back. Grudge matches, they call them. Hatfield and McCoy situation, that we get into those grudge matches. So right now the United States is in the throes of a grudge match that they have been at for well more than 100 years, what, 160 years. So here's a question for you: what would things be like if Lincoln had changed his mind, or that McClellan got his way? You know who McClellan was? Uh, he was a general of the Army that trained the, uh, the forces, the Union forces. He trained them and trained them and trained them and trained them and trained them because he didn't want to go to war. Most people didn't. It was when McClellan was replaced that they went to war. Who wanted that? Lincoln. The question is, why did the people of the United States so highly praise Lincoln, sometimes on both sides of the fence, when he started a war that ain't over yet? So what would have happened if the local situations that happened in South Carolina that culminated in Fort Sumter— well, let them have Sutra. Have you frozen? Have we lost our connection?

**Speaker A:** Uh, no, I'm still here.

**Speaker B:** Okay. All right, your image has frozen, but at least you're still listening. So in a way, you could say that, um, because of the demographics between the North and South that the United States and the people of the United States may all be better off if it wasn't one great big country that goes to war and does nuclear weapons and all of that kind of stuff. We have literally— the U.S. has been at war since its founding, one war after another, after another, after another. And that would have been the great one to stop having. Let's not have a civil war, let's let this thing bust apart and everybody goes his own way. And then we wouldn't have things like Fort Hood or Shaw Air Force Base.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Damarato] Sure. Yeah, I think the U.S. may be better off had it split up. That said, you can make the argument, too, that there may still be a lot of Black people enslaved, right? Which would be terrible.

**Speaker C:** So.

**Speaker B:** It depends upon whether they know the Underground Railroad, that in fact, even after the war, the Blacks in the South were enslaved, and in fact, they still are in many ways. But there was a huge exodus. That lasted for decades. It was really strong in the 1930s, Black Flight out of the South. And in fact, even when I was there, it was very typical for the grandmothers to take care of the babies while Mom and Dad were up north someplace in a union, making good decent wage, and everybody lived fairly comfortable. I think that still exists in ways. But the problem is, is that had the South done it in a more genteel way, maybe slavery would have been abolished, just like it was all over the rest of the world. Without a war that required revenge? It could have been settled peacefully.

**Speaker A:** That's an interesting question for historians.

**Speaker B:** No, not for historians. This is the question for Dhamma dudes. The historians have an axe to grind; depends upon which side of the war he was on.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Q] Sure.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] So, why would it then be a question for Dhamma dudes? The answer is, is that the United States, in the way and the situation that it's in, It's fairly easy to see that it is now a revenge-based society. That there is still a bit of that in Europe, except that they've been able to take their revenge pointing from Germany, and now have been pointing it at the Soviet Union and then Russia. And Russia doesn't like the Bengal disappointing. And that's why they're having a war in Ukraine, is because it was taken away from the Soviet Union in the breakup, but they want it back. They want it back. They want revenge. And from what I understand, that's not just Putin, that that's the whole Russian mentality. Is that it's ours, don't belong to the people who live there. Now why is that? That's because Soviet Union made sure through their propaganda machines over the decades to grind that into the mentality of the people, rather than let's just all get along here. So our governments go way overboard with all of the extra wars that we don't need.

**Speaker A:** That is definitely true. You know, one counter-argument is there are still societies today that have slavery. You know, they just don't call it that. Like, say, in the United Arab Emirates, for example.

**Speaker B:** How about the US? They call it the child breed worker, the guy on the, um, uh, the line, except in wearing a ball and chain. They've got him by the wallet.

**Speaker A:** Sure, it starts with the credit cards.

**Speaker B:** Actually, that's the new way of doing it. That's, that's the, that's the new slavery. Is a slave to debt, right? That's part of the reason. So the Republicans, they do not want debt forgiveness for the average Joe Blow, right? Keep them in debt. Because if you get somebody out of debt, he may think about quitting his job. Because the reason he's had his job is because he had to pay for all the stuff that he got that he no longer has and doesn't enjoy. All he's got now is bills to pay, right? So that's the wisdom coming. Are we going to be wisely ignorant, or are we going to continue with the delusions and do what we were told to do by the society.

**Speaker A:** Right? So you would characterize— oh, sorry, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** No, go.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. So you would characterize delusion as a step below ignorance?

**Speaker B:** Yes, definitely. Or let us say, if it's multicolored, black and white, that delusion is the black part, and the white part would be wise ignorance, that you don't know and you know that you don't know. And if you don't know well enough, then you're quite happy that you don't know. Know. So there would be a middle ground, and that is you don't know but you want to know. And then there's a side that you think you know when down deep inside you know you really don't. And then there's the bottom of the pile, and that is those who are absolutely convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt when in fact they've got no shred of evidence at all. That's where you find the Christians, the zealots, the Republicans, is deep in that ignorance.

**Speaker A:** There was an article recently in The Atlantic about how the majority of Americans, when asked, when surveyed, say that they are happy, but they believe, then they believe their life is going in a positive direction. But they believe that the country is not going in a positive direction. I think it's like 75-78% say that their life is going in a positive direction, and the same amount say that the country is not going in a positive direction, right?

**Speaker B:** Okay, so everybody's listening. Those who think their lives are going in a positive direction are listening to the report, to the Democrats sometimes, and then when they think that everything is going to hell in a handcart that's because they're listening to the Republicans, because that's the Republican stock and trade. They've got to make a problem because they have nothing actually to offer. And the question is, why should they have anything to offer at all? We can control all of those people by getting them really uptight and upset about those people who do have something to offer, right? And the problem with those who have something to offer is it's often a lie anyway, and everybody knows it. They promise things they can't deliver, right? So they've always got to have a mansion, right? I'm not talking about a big house you live in.

**Speaker C:** Sure.

**Speaker B:** So, um, gotta have a, uh, a fly in the ointment. Gotta have an excuse so why we can't do stuff, right? I mean, if they were going to do something about healthcare, they would have done something about healthcare. And what have they got now? They've got Obamacare. And as good as it is, the Republicans are still working really hard to trash it. If the Democrats were actually able to deliver some actual, real healthcare that any country has, what would the Republicans have to say?

**Speaker C:** Not much.

**Speaker B:** I mean, what's wrong with having national health?

**Speaker C:** Not much.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, the people who want to control other people don't want those other people to have health care so that those who do control things can provide the health care for them. It's all a matter of power, which is back to the original part that we were talking about, because they're afraid. If you go around telling other people to be afraid of this, that, and the other thing, how are you going to wind up feeling yourself?

**Speaker A:** Good.

**Speaker B:** And if you are afraid by nature, then which side are you going to be supporting? Those who are already afraid, or those who are trying to talk you out of not being so afraid to enjoy your life, right?

**Speaker C:** So the reason I brought up the quote from The Atlantic is I think a lot of people would characterize themselves as happy, but they haven't actually looked at their own mind, right? And when they characterize their life as going in a positive direction, but they haven't actually investigated.

**Speaker B:** And so it's a kind of delusion. You're right.

**Speaker C:** Yes. And so what are your thoughts on these types of people that would say, I'm happy, I've everything figured out, but they don't and they're not actually happy? Like, what are your thoughts?

**Speaker B:** It depends upon where, when, and how that question is asked. If it's asked out on the street with somebody with a microphone and a cameraman, you know that the person is going to say it in one way. If you find him sitting on the gutter beside the street, it's the same person because they're going to give you different information, right? What about the guy who's checking into the psychiatric ward? Same person. Or let us just say that it's your sister-in-law and she just winds up at the house in a pity party. What's she going to say then? And after she leaves the house, she goes back out on the street and meets some dude with the microphone phone and a cameraman. And what's she going to say again, right? She's delusionally— and she doesn't even know that she's lying, because she's lying every time. She'll say yes, I feel great to one, and no, I feel terrible to another. And she's lying in both cases because she's not the same one. Then in fact, she does feel good when she says she feels good, and she feels lousy when she says she feels lousy. And she doesn't know she's got no ignorance that she's got control over the way that she feels, right? Very few of them do. And so they'll lie themselves actually into a good mood when they're asked in the right way under the right circumstances, right? And they'll lie. But not only do they lie, but they will actually then take on that persona in order for it to be correct, that you can easily cheer somebody up that way.

**Speaker C:** Right? I think, um, a lot of people see happiness as a form of status, right? So, you know, they don't want to be in a lower status, so they'll say they're happy. You know, or acknowledge themselves as happy when actually they're not. They're just kind of indicating, oh, I'm a high status person or whatever, and that's why they're saying that.

**Speaker B:** Right. Again, it depends upon the circumstances, and that would be the circumstances of being out on the street with somebody with a microphone and cameraman, and you want to have status there, you want to have some meaning, and so you're going to perk yourself up and lie. Right, about the general situation of the mind. But at least right now we're not lying because we do feel good enough. Yeah, I'm okay.

**Speaker C:** Right? And a lot of people know that being a victim can be considered by others as a low status position, right? And they don't want to be seen as a victim, so they say that they're happy in order to not be seen as a victim. But that's not what they're actually demonstrating or feeling, right?

**Speaker B:** And what is then the choice for the victim is to not stay in a state of fear and denial but change it into anger and wanting revenge, right? Who walks in to make a complaint at the police station who is not trying to prove, by the way, he feels, that he has actually got a value for being revengeful. And yet, he's not going to be— well, let us say, in certain circumstances he will, but the likelihood of him being in psychotherapy is that he's going to become the victim, which is the more real point. But a good psychologist will bring him down to that. To come out of your seeking revenge and, and talk about how you've been hurt and how you feel.

**Speaker C:** Right?

**Speaker B:** You're not going to get that on the street with a microphone and a cameraman, right? Well, this is a clear example of what we've talked about, I think, before, that in statistics the observer always bastardizes his data. He always bastardizes it. Depends upon which street corner he stands on. You can certainly stand on some street corners like Times Square and you're going to get a whole lot of that, and then you can go over to the Bowery, whatever the equivalent of the Bowery is, to stand there and ask the question. You're going to get a whole different statistical set of answers, right? So much for statistics. In fact, I belong in that group of— you've heard it before— there are liars, damned liars, and statistics.

**Speaker A:** Statisticians.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because statistics can mean anything, right? And so you have to work with statistics Let us say in a generalized kind of way, that if you have 5 or 6 different statistics done by 5 or 6 different poll groups, and they're all pointing in the same direction, then you can say, "OK, I'll take it at face value." But if they have only one poll that's going in the other direction, then, well, maybe this week we can kind of not pay much attention to the polls, right? So that's a way of looking at it, is that we can't go by one poll. And yet that is what our media is built upon. We want the spikes. You see, in real statistics, we want to level out the spikes. We want to throw out the stuff that skews what we think should be the good data.

**Speaker C:** Sure.

**Speaker B:** Okay, that we throw— so you, you throw the top 10% out and you throw the bottom 10% out, and then you've got a better— because you, you might have gotten some mistakes in there. But in our society and in our media, they are actually going to pick out the spikes, the highs and the lows. And make that the point of their case.

**Speaker C:** Right. I mean, I would say too, you know, getting back to the example of someone that says that they're happy but they might not actually be happy, if I were to think back to periods in my life that were quite stressful periods and you were to ask me, it didn't matter if it was on the street or a friend asking me, I would still probably say I was happy. And part of it was acknowledging that my life is going in a positive direction, you know, by the standards of society, right? And I think a lot of people—.

**Speaker B:** And also a standard by which doesn't exist, and that is the standard of time. You're putting a whole lot of time in there rather than looking at the actual highs and lows. How do you feel right now? I feel happy. How do I feel right now? Right, okay. That's what we miss out on. We level all of that stuff out, right, rather than seeing the things the way that they actually are. Because those spikes and those troughs are actually the best learning experiences. That's the actual stumping of the toe. Wakey wakey! Let's use those things in, in the day-to-day rather than trying to level things out. Let's see what's going on in detail right now. So you're actually asking the question— let me at least say that a way to ask the question is, how can we do statistics in a way that brightens people up? And that would be what we— and, and the heck with, uh, the statistics, but let's just brighten people up. If we can use the ruse of statistics, okay, I'm not against using statistics to help cheer people up out on the street or whatever, but the, but the point is, is that it's always in the moment. You can't cheer somebody else or somebody up right now and expect them to stay cheered up for 10 minutes, they're going to walk into somebody that's going to tear them right back down again, right?

**Speaker C:** But I would say too, a lot of this has to do with definitions of happiness, right?

**Speaker B:** Okay, I got that too, right? Exactly.

**Speaker C:** Yeah. And so, you know, I think in the Buddhist teaching, the Dhamma definition, right, happiness is a very immediate thing. You know, it's a feeling. Right. And I think the way a lot of people may perceive happiness is, do I have meaning? Do I have purpose? Is my life going in the direction of something that I find valuable? And they'll say they're happy.

**Speaker B:** They would say it that way. But a real way, a deeper way of talking about it is, do they feel secure?

**Speaker C:** Right.

**Speaker B:** So when they say, am I doing the right thing? Is my life headed in the right direction. What they're saying is, is it's not heading towards the sewer, right? But in fact, that I feel safe that we're not heading towards the sewer, right? So that's where the value is, that, um, that we have to actually— this is an important point then for practices, to recognize that this is the area, that it doesn't matter which direction we're going in, so long as the direction that we're going in is not a dangerous direction to go in. And the Buddha actually speaks it in that way, when he talks about that what is wrong action is harming, stealing, ratting on people, that kind of stuff. But what then is the right behavior, is merely to abstain from that short-lived Buddhist, right? That where you go and which direction your life takes is irrelevant so long as it feels safe and secure to go in that direction, right? And a lot of people don't get that because they're looking at it from the— in— from the backwards or the inside out, or they're seeing it in a mirror way of saying that, oh, my life is going in the right direction because it's gaining things that I want and I don't feel afraid, right? However, the reality is, is that they're actually able to avoid danger.

**Speaker C:** Right?

**Speaker B:** And so this is really what wisdom is all about. Can we live our lives wisely so that we can avoid avoid the danger because we can see it sometimes months before it happens. Sometimes we can see it days before it happens. Sometimes we can see it immediately before it happens. But when we don't see it until it does happen, it's hit us anyway, right? Okay, so, uh, like the old man who's swinging his shotgun around on his shoulder— uh, not shoulder, but under his arm. Pointing it at this kneecap and the next kneecap, everybody who's standing around him sees the direction his shotgun is pointing, and they don't like it because it makes them feel afraid. Because if that gun does go off, it's going to go off in whichever direction the barrel's pointed. This is what we mean then by wisdom. Wisdom is seeing which direction things are headed, but we don't know when it's going to go off. We don't know exactly where it's going to hit. We don't know the future, but we can sure see things, the direction that things are headed. See that in conversations, you know, like argument, 3 minutes ahead.

**Speaker C:** Sure.

**Speaker B:** Or bad feelings, 5 seconds ahead.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's funny, I have a family member that has everything they could possibly want, you know, materially, you know, freedom, etc. But whenever you talk with them, constant negativity.

**Speaker C:** And when you ask them, are they happy, they say yes.

**Speaker A:** But it sure doesn't seem that way when you talk, when you listen to them talk, you know.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, he says he's happy because he's supposed to be happy. He's got everything that he ever wanted in order to be happy, and he's still not happy, and he doesn't want to admit that, right?

**Speaker C:** Right.

**Speaker B:** He doesn't want to admit, as with all the success that he's got, he still feels like a failure, right? And he doesn't want to admit it, right? Okay, so don't put him into a position to where he has to admit it. Right, but put him in a position to where he can see it for himself.

**Speaker C:** Right?

**Speaker B:** That's the way of practicing, is to be able to point things out. And in fact, with the— there's a sutta about that in, uh, number 139. When it actually is talking about teaching the Dharma. And the way that it's done— and you hear me doing that a lot— is that we don't talk about me and you. We talk about the Dharma in an abstract way. And often the examples that I will give will be intentionally over the top, right? Okay, so that you— so that the students can see the example but not take it personally, right? Okay. And another thing that the sutra talks about, um, rather than speaking in generalities, is also speak in the language of the student, right? That's the problem with Dhamma language. Dhamma's got its own language. I mean, it's been messing with this language for 2,500 years, and we've got it down to pattern. We know the language. Unfortunately, that's not the language that people speak. So in order to speak the Dhamma, we've got to actually teach it in the language that the student is going to understand, right? And so those are the two hints. Don't talk about what he's doing wrong. Talk about Bernie Madoff, right? Or talk about Biden. Well, no, Biden's not a good example for him. Um, uh, Ben Bernanke, other very, very high prominent Jewish, totally successful dudes. That are not known for being happy, well-adjusted people, right? There's plenty, because there's plenty of them around. That misery doesn't create wealth in order for, uh, the misery to be abated. Misery creates wealth to make a whole lot of people miserable. Power. I want power. I want to feel safe. And yet, even through all this money, I still don't feel safe. Because I do have all this power, a whole lot of people other than me don't feel safe because I'm dangerous. And why am I dangerous? Is because, number one, I'm afraid, and number two, I've got money. And that's the society we live in. It's a dangerous society.

**Speaker C:** Right?

**Speaker B:** And so now the next thing for him to look at would then be Bill Gates. That Bill Gates, as well as others that we can talk about, finally woke up that as long as he was running Microsoft The more money he got, he was not happy. I see this also having slowly to happen with Elon Musk, and it certainly happened to Zuckerberg and Bezos, is that their wealth doesn't make them happy. But with Bill Gates, he quit making money and started giving it away. What has he done? He's done stuff with AIDS, he's done stuff with technology, he's given his money away in ways that has brought joy to him. It's called philanthropy.

**Speaker A:** Right?

**Speaker B:** And so that would be something that he could find joy from, is by actually benefiting other people. And letting them have that joy, and then he takes his joy from them, right? So Bill Gates is a very good example, but he's not the only example of a philanthropist. But I think Zuckerberg's wife wanted to take half his money so she could give it away, and that got into a great big squabble.

**Speaker A:** Bezos' wife gave away a bunch you know, as soon as they divorced, you know, she gave away billions like immediately.

**Speaker B:** And I bet she was more happy doing that than he was in her doing it.

**Speaker A:** Probably.

**Speaker B:** But there's great joy in being generous, right? It's hard to describe.

**Speaker A:** Sure. Getting back to the wise ignorance, Oh, sorry, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** The Lord— if we can do a little Jewish hocus pocus— the Lord loves a cheerful giver, right? So that's an area that you can work with, right? So getting back to all my millions into, hey, I can do something of value, right? I can sort of— a young budding author Arahant.

**Speaker A:** Great. Yeah, certainly. That would be nice. But yeah, getting back to the point about wise ignorance, I would imagine wise ignorance would lead to right effort immediately, right? You know, given that someone is wise to their ignorance, they would immediately start trying to repair what it is that they are ignorant about.

**Speaker B:** Precisely. And that repair, the first thing about it is investigation. Let's go find where the rot is. Let's just not cut into stuff, right? Let's go find out what needs to be changed. Let's go look for the unwholesome and make a change to it, to change the mind from unwholesome to wholesome, to change it from insecure and needing wealth into feeling comfortable, safe, and satisfied, so you can let go of all of that. And now we are not so burdened. That's the very funny thing about wealth, is everybody wants wealth in order to be safe, and now when they get wealth, they have two things that are dangerous: themselves and their money. And so they've got to work really hard to make the money safe so the money will make them safe.

**Speaker A:** Right. That's something I've noticed with my family member that, you know, once he acquired wealth, all these people started trying to take it from him, you know, like friends and family members, you know, etc. Like people would try and kind of cheat him out of it. And it's kind of a sad thing because it leaves one person feeling isolated. You know, who can you trust?

**Speaker B:** Absolutely. This is the biggest problem that they've had with sweepstakes and lottery.

**Speaker A:** Yep.

**Speaker B:** That if you notice, in the past 20 or more years, they have, uh, doled it out over 20-year pay, right? Why did they do that? Because people, when they get all the money at once, at some, they destroy their lives.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** Have a whole lot of help from a whole lot of people who want to enjoy the money that they've got. Right. Relatives you never heard of will come up.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** And every business in town wants your business. They want you as a customer.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there's a great writer, he's the one that coined that term skin in the game. I told you about a a while back, and he's a wealthy guy, and he talked about how mansions are a scam because humans are much happier living in close communities, like say, like in a city, like, you know, like in New York, you know, you know all your neighbors, you know, etc. You're friends with everyone.

**Speaker B:** Mansion is not a mansion. Now that's symbolic. The mansion part is symbolic. The original point was that it was a fortress, right? Because the rich dude was afraid that they were going to rip him off when he wasn't looking. That's why he built a fort. That's what the castles were all about. Modern mansions are nothing but just a relic of castles that were built because everybody was scared because they were ripping people off to get their money, and the people wanted the money back. They wanted revenge, right? That's the really important thing about power. People think that if they get power, they're safe. And no, if you've got power, that means you've got people coming after it for one reason or another. And the most logical one is they want revenge, right? And that was exactly what was happening when he got wealthy. Look at all the people who came for the revenge.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** How dare them? How dare him be more wealthy than I am? Is the underlying point in there, that why does he deserve all of that money? Never mind if he actually scammed it, got it. Why don't you go scam somebody and get some yourself? Oh well, that's exactly what you are doing. You're scamming the scammer.

**Speaker A:** Good luck with that.

**Speaker B:** So they know who to go scam because he's the one who was really good at scamming.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So that means that you're going to have to be even more careful and more wise to be able to teach him about the value of generosity without him thinking that you're doing a scam, right? Good luck with that. Tiptoe through those tulips. Great.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I've got a good track record though, so that's good. You know, I'm very honest, you know, etc. But yeah, it's funny, there's a Reddit post a while back with a guy who won the lottery. And he just sounded miserable. You know, he would talk about how he didn't talk to any of his friends anymore. You know, he didn't talk to his family. You know, he was constantly getting hit up for money. And the guy, like he said, he's glad he has the money, but he felt pretty isolated. You know, it was a sad situation.

**Speaker B:** Um, but it's so well known, it happens actually every time. So by doing it over 20 years, you let them screw up really badly for the first 3 years, and after that they learn to handle their money before it runs out, right? Guess what? It doesn't work. Sometimes they have to spend 20 years doing it wrong 20 times in a row. With new scammers and new things to buy, and they just never figure it out, right?

**Speaker A:** I think it was Herodotus, the Greek historian, and he said that wealth is actually a bad thing that can happen to someone because it leads them to make a lot of mistakes and get themselves entangled in situations that are stressful. You know, and poverty is also a bad thing, you know, for similar reasons. But extremes— walk the middle way.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. There are extremes in wealth and extremes in poverty, and if people are going to find value and happiness and a good life, somewhere in the middle.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** And that if you're afraid of poverty, then we can recognize, well, maybe your bottom line can get pretty low so long as you're satisfied. All we need is just basic adequate housing, basic adequate food, basic adequate shelter, adequate medicine. And a lot of people in the United States, even some of them that have money, don't have those those things.

**Speaker C:** Right?

**Speaker B:** There's a lot of working poor because they— and we call them poor because they don't have the basic bare necessities.

**Speaker C:** Right?

**Speaker B:** And they don't even recognize that they could, if they did it wisely, would wind up having the bare necessities of life. But then they could be happy, right? Sometimes what that means is you have to move to another town because this one doesn't give you the bare necessities that you need, right? So that's the big issue, is where can we find our own balance to make life really easy.

**Speaker A:** Right?

**Speaker B:** And the more money the better doesn't seem to work.

**Speaker A:** Right?

**Speaker B:** And for sure, abject poverty doesn't work. Someplace in the middle is good.

**Speaker A:** Sure.

**Speaker B:** And so your, your friend, your family member, will actually be better off if he he gives some of that money away.

**Speaker C:** Right?

**Speaker B:** That's the generosity part. He'll actually feel better. But we need to train him by doing very small things, by giving someone a compliment, right? That right now he's really, really stingy, and so we need to start opening up his generosity.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you know, it's funny, there is a— what was I going to say? There is another family member that.

**Speaker B:** Maybe needs to have some compliments from him.

**Speaker A:** Right, right. And this family member would like to go on, you know, and this is, this is not, I'm not talking about Sandra, I'm talking about a different, different one, an Auntie. And, and this other family member with the money likes to send this one lots of pictures of all the things that they're spending their money on, right? And with the hopes that it will inspire this other family member to go travel, enjoy life, etc. And I think it's actually just making the auntie miserable, you know, like, just like, oh, look at all this.

**Speaker B:** I would say so. I would say the photo should be of family Family connections, family sitting around on the couch, that's the kind of photos that he needs.

**Speaker A:** Yes, and yeah, I think it's not a good strategy.

**Speaker B:** Pictures of outings. Right, right.

**Speaker A:** And you know what's interesting about that? Is I think for this family member that's sending the photos, it's partly a power trip of, oh, look what I can afford, look what I'm doing, you know, and look how much money I have, etc. And it's interesting how I think this family member does not realize that he comes across that way. You know, or maybe that that's what he's actually doing, is kind of on a power trip. Um, but he is. And so I think it's interesting how people can get deluded and they have no idea as to how they're deluded or what they're, they're doing that's wrong, you know.

**Speaker B:** Okay, my, my thought there is to send him a photo of something that you can, uh, how to say you bring it up like, look what I did, my— what a great big good boy am I, or wow, look at what I can afford, right? Uh, here's my new Lamborghini, but you send him a photo of a toy, right? Right. That's the way to handle that, is to give him back what he's giving out, but do it in a way that he begins to see that, uh, you're not taking what he's doing seriously, right? That's the way that I would handle that.

**Speaker A:** Right? Yeah, I've done a little bit actually.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's, that's a way of handling that, is to give them back, uh, photos. Um, that are making a mockery of what his photos are. Like, if he's got a real grizzly stuffed bear that he has in the, uh, the hallway entrance to his mansion, then you send him a picture of a teddy bear that's been all beat up.

**Speaker A:** That's a funny example.

**Speaker B:** So whatever his outlandish, uh, things are, you know. So if he sends you a picture of his new, uh, big swimming pool, send him a picture of a kiddie pool, right? That's the way to handle him, right?

**Speaker A:** I have a question for you off the recorder.

**Speaker B:** Um, all right, well, let's go ahead and finish the recording now, and then we'll do that, okay? I think we've had enough fun on there. All right, so we'll see you guys later.

**Speaker A:** All right, great.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) with Sangha friends (Speakers A and C), explores the core Buddhist concept of **ignorance (avijjā)** and its pivotal role in suffering, framed within modern societal and personal contexts.

Here is a summary of the key themes and progression of the discussion:

### **Core Theme: Wise Ignorance vs. Foolish Ignorance (Delusion)**
The central distinction made is between:
*   **Wise Ignorance:** Knowing that you don't know. This is a conscious, humble acceptance of uncertainty that leads to careful investigation and avoids harm.
*   **Foolish Ignorance (Delusion):** Not knowing that you don't know, or thinking you know when you don't. This leads to jumping to conclusions, arguments, and suffering—like stubbing your toe in the dark because you *assumed* you knew the way.

### **Main Discussion Points:**

1.  **Societal Conditioning Against "Not Knowing":** Modern society (e.g., multiple-choice tests, media) often rewards guessing and having quick opinions, while viewing "I don't know" with suspicion. This promotes delusion over wise inquiry.

2.  **Wisdom as a Substitute for Fear:** Wisdom is presented as a tool to proactively recognize the "trajectory" of potential harm (in speech, actions, situations) and step out of the way, rather than relying on the reactive instinct of fear after damage is done.

3.  **The Role of Investigation (Right View):** True Dhamma practice is contrasted with passive psychology. It involves actively investigating one's own mind to gather **evidence** about what causes suffering and happiness, moving from delusion to wise understanding.

4.  **Application to Personal & Political Life:**
    *   **Arguments:** Often stem from emotional delusion ("you should feel how I think you should") disguised as factual debate (e.g., sports rivalries).
    *   **Politics & Revenge:** U.S. and global politics are analyzed as being largely driven by long-standing cycles of revenge and grudge matches (e.g., Civil War, modern partisanship), rather than wise governance.
    *   **Wealth & Happiness:** Wealth, often sought for security, frequently leads to isolation, fear, and new forms of bondage (e.g., debt, predatory relationships). True security and happiness are found in a balanced "middle way," not in extremes. **Generosity (dāna)** is highlighted as a key practice that brings genuine joy, as exemplified by philanthropists like Bill Gates.

5.  **The Nature of "Happiness":** A distinction is made between the societal definition of happiness (status, life direction, material success) and the Dhamma's immediate, felt experience of happiness rooted in **security and the absence of fear**. Many who claim to be happy may be deluding themselves based on status or future projections, not present-moment investigation.

6.  **Practical Dhamma Teaching:** The talk concludes with advice on teaching others: speak in generalities and the listener's own language to avoid defensiveness, and use over-the-top examples to help them see truths indirectly.

### **Key Takeaways & Reframings:**
*   **The Second Noble Truth:** The "ignorance" that causes craving is specifically **delusion**, not wise ignorance.
*   **The Serenity Prayer:** Adapted to a Buddhist context: Wisdom is to accept what you cannot change, and to clearly see and act upon what you **can** change—primarily your own mind and immediate environment.
*   **The Path:** Wise ignorance naturally leads to **Right Effort** and **Investigation**: looking for the "rot" in the mind to replace the unwholesome with the wholesome.
*   **Safety over Direction:** A wise life is less about going in a "positive direction" by societal standards, and more about wisely avoiding danger and creating a sense of secure contentment in the present.

In essence, the talk is a call to replace societal and personal **delusion** with **mindful investigation** and **wise ignorance**, thereby reducing suffering in everyday interactions, political views, and our relationship with wealth and happiness.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by the speakers, primarily by Speaker B (Dhammarato), to illustrate the concepts of **wise ignorance vs. foolish ignorance/delusion** and related themes:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **"Jumping to a conclusion, no matter what cesspool you land in"**: This metaphor criticizes a societal tendency to value quick answers (even guesses) over admitting "I don't know." The "cesspool" represents the negative, messy, or false outcomes of such hasty judgments.

2.  **"Slings and arrows of outrageous fortune"**: Borrowed from Shakespeare (*Hamlet*), this metaphor is repurposed. Here, wisdom allows you to see the "trajectory" of these attacks (criticism, misfortune) and step out of the way, rather than getting hit "stupidly" through delusion.

3.  **The "Trajectory" or "Direction" of Things**: Used repeatedly as a metaphor for wisdom. Wise ignorance involves observing the direction of a conversation, an emotion, or a societal trend to foresee potential harm (like seeing where a gun is pointed) and avoid it, even without knowing the exact outcome.

4.  **"Fly in the ointment"**: A metaphor for an excuse or a problem that prevents positive action (e.g., why systemic change can't happen).

5.  **"Sewer" as a destination**: Represents a dangerous or negative life path that wisdom helps you avoid.

6.  **"Skin in the game"**: Referenced from another writer, it's used to discuss the pitfalls of wealth and isolation, contrasting with the happiness found in close communities.

7.  **"Mansion" as a fortress/castle**: A metaphor for how wealth is often about building fortifications out of fear (of losing wealth or seeking revenge) rather than creating genuine happiness.

8.  **"Walking the middle way" between extremes**: A core Buddhist metaphor applied to wealth and poverty, suggesting both extremes are stressful and a balanced middle path is preferable.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **Stubbing Your Toe in the Dark**: The central illustrative story.
    *   **Scenario**: You get up at night, don't turn on the light because you *think* you know the way to the bathroom, and you stub your toe.
    *   **Point**: This is **delusion (foolish ignorance)**—thinking you know when you don't. **Wise ignorance** would be admitting you can't see and turning on the light. The story is extended as a metaphor for how we create suffering (arguments, unsatisfactory situations) by thinking we know things (people's feelings, facts) when we are actually in the dark.

2.  **Soccer Fan Rivalry (Manchester vs. Liverpool)**:
    *   **Scenario**: Fans from rival cities argue and brawl over which team is better.
    *   **Point**: This exemplifies arguments based on **delusion** and opinion with no evidence. It highlights how people fight emotionally over identities and preferences while disguising it as a factual debate. The speaker says you can substitute "my team" for "my opinion," "my dog," or "my idea."

3.  **The Old Man with a Shotgun**:
    *   **Scenario**: An old man carelessly swings a shotgun, pointing it at people's knees. Everyone nearby feels afraid because they can see the direction the barrel is pointed.
    *   **Point**: This is a direct metaphor for **wisdom**. You don't know *if* or *when* the gun will fire, but you can see the dangerous direction it's pointing and move out of the way. Similarly, wisdom lets you see the dangerous direction of a conversation or situation and avoid it.

4.  **Physicists vs. Catholics Seeking Evidence**:
    *   **Scenario**: Particle physicists spend billions (e.g., at CERN) desperately seeking evidence, even if it proves their theories wrong. In contrast, the speaker argues institutions like the Catholic Church avoid evidence for fear it would disprove their doctrines.
    *   **Point**: Contrasts a mindset of **wise inquiry** (eager for evidence, comfortable not knowing) with **deluded dogma** (clinging to beliefs without evidence). This is linked to the Dhamma as a personal evidence-based investigation of the mind.

5.  **Lottery Winner's Miserable Life**:
    *   **Scenario**: Referencing a Reddit post, a lottery winner becomes isolated, harassed for money, and miserable despite his wealth.
    *   **Point**: Illustrates that extreme wealth does not bring happiness and can actually create fear, isolation, and attract "revenge" (people trying to take the money). Supports the "middle way" argument.

6.  **Historical/Political Anecdotes as Extended Metaphors**:
    *   **The U.S. Civil War and Ongoing "Grudge Match"**: The entire political discussion frames U.S. history as a long-running story of **revenge** (the South vs. the North, Republicans vs. Democrats). This "grudge match" is presented as a national-scale story of **delusion and foolish ignorance**, where the drive for revenge overrides wisdom and well-being.
    *   **Philanthropists Finding Joy (Bill Gates, etc.)**: Brief stories of wealthy individuals like Bill Gates finding more happiness in giving money away (philanthropy) than in accumulating it. This is offered as a corrective story for the deluded wealthy family member, illustrating how generosity can break the cycle of fear and isolation caused by wealth.

### **Key Conceptual Framing (Metaphorical Language)**

*   **Wise Ignorance vs. Foolish Ignorance/Delusion**: The entire talk is structured around this metaphorical dichotomy, often color-coded in the speaker's mind (white vs. black).
*   **Society Promoting "Guessing" and "Multiple Choice"**: The education system is used as a metaphor for a culture that rewards quick, often unsubstantiated, answers over thoughtful inquiry and admission of not knowing.
*   **Wealth as a Fortress & Source of Fear**: The accumulation of wealth is repeatedly framed not as a path to safety, but as a creation of a fortress that breeds fear (of loss) and attracts attacks (from those seeking "revenge" or a share).

These metaphors and stories collectively build the argument that recognizing our ignorance wisely ("I don't know, and that's okay") is the foundation for investigation, evidence-based understanding, and ultimately, a life of greater safety, generosity, and happiness.
