### Transcript


**Speaker A:** up with.

**Speaker B:** But that's the question though, is the question gives dialogue or words to you so that basically, if you can think of it like this, the kind of personal approach, if you can say it that way, that I'm taking is to give very, very clear definitions of terms, because those very clear definitions of terms then give clarity to what we're doing, as opposed to having wishy-washy terms that then leave a lot of doubt. So, um, the first thing we can do is to look at the word thought, okay? And recognize that there are many, many different kinds of thoughts if we define thought as whatever is happening in the mind during a mind moment or a mind cycle, okay? And we talked about this a bit before, a mind moment or a mind cycle. And that most people, when they use the word thought, they think of it in the sense of discursive thought, words that we use in the mind to describe something. But that's not the only kind of thought there is. That in fact, if you feel a sensation, for instance, you can feel the headphones on your head. That feeling, the headphones on your head, perhaps both of them— in fact, you can actually feel the whole arc as it goes around. While you're actually paying attention to the headphones, you're not talking about it, but you are thinking about the headphones. You think about the touch of the headphones, but it's not done with language. It's a different kind of thinking. And spend quite a lot of our time without verbal thoughts, but we are doing— in fact, what you can say is that many times we do arithmetic and talk our way through it, but the faster way to do it is to just do it image-wise. Without saying the word one plus one in the mind, because that takes too long. That in fact, things take longer than the events. That the description of Anapanasati, especially the way it's practiced with the Eightfold Noble Path, takes 5, 10, or 20 minutes to talk about. Just one cycle that is going to happen within a split second. So our verbal dialogue actually slows things down. And that when you and I are talking, I'm talking in this language, building concepts, and then you have to take the language that I'm using and reconstruct that concept within your mind. Where that's problematic because all you're getting generally is a concept. But there is other ways we can communicate. That's why written documentation is very, very poor because it misses out on 90% or more of the communication and conversation. And the only thing that's left is the slow, slow words of constructing concepts. All right, so that means then that you were taking thought moments of your eyes and responding to that without having any verbal thoughts.

**Speaker A:** This is so interesting because I've been reading the book, the new book that came out by Bhikkhu Buddhadasa called Eye of the Dhamma. And what they talk about in there is how you, when you first start studying Buddhism, the only thing you need to know as your foundation are the ABCs of Buddhism. Which are the six senses: the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, the body, and the mind. And the mind is the most important.

**Speaker B:** And what's interesting is that the most often used— it's not the most important— most often used, and it's the one that needs to be managed the most.

**Speaker A:** Because if you can manage the mind, you can manage the other senses as well. Because without the mind, you can't have the senses, and without the senses, you can't have the mind.

**Speaker B:** Well, yes, but the point is, is that by managing the mind, what we mean by that is using it less and using our senses more, right?

**Speaker A:** Oh, okay.

**Speaker B:** Which means that we spend more time observing and looking and using our mind that way, and use fewer mind moments telling ourselves a story about what we they saw.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and that's what they were saying. They're saying like, there's seeing happening through the eyes. But there's this thing called cognizing. And I didn't understand what that was until you just said it. I think that's what it is, that even though there's no like thoughts happening necessarily, there's another way that that information is transferred.

**Speaker B:** Now that cognizing that you're talking about, or cognition, uh, and another word, uh, is rather than cog would be sept, like in perception or cognition. But generally what we do is, is that we do it the same thing over again. In other words, we don't just recognize, we recognize, or we recognize. That's what the cognition is about. But in fact, that's sometimes why we have to cognize and then cognize and then cognize again to see the pattern. And that the human mind, especially the way that it's trained in the West, is to see it once. And cognize a lot.

**Speaker A:** Is doubt the last thing to go?

**Speaker B:** Doubt is actually just a bunch of cognizing that's done while you're not looking. But a better thing to do is to look and not do so much cognizing. That, that, uh, when you said that the mind is the most important, I would say no, it's the one that's the most frequent. Used because we go immediately from see to think, and then from see, think, feel. But we can also go directly from see to feel without going to the cognizing steps. In other words, you can see a child on the other side of the room fall down or something happens, and you see it, and you're out of your chair on the way over there without ever having thought the thoughts of, oh, I've got to go rescue that child. You're already rescuing the child. You're on your way to rescue. You don't have to tell yourself to go rescue the child. You're already gone. Okay, so, but that doesn't happen a lot. Most of the time we'll see and then think about it and then, um, uh, act.

**Speaker A:** So we were talking about gladdening the mind. Oh, I haven't been gladdening the mind right now, right?

**Speaker B:** That's a cognition, that's a thought. That's not gladdening the mind. That's fussing at yourself for not gladdening the mind. So a better way to do it is, is that when you, let us say, see or remember— that's the Sati. Why does the Sati about, uh, gladdening the mind have to go into the cognition of 'Oh, you haven't been doing it.' When in fact the cognition of, or the waking up of the Sati, with the, let us say, direction of the intention of gladdening the mind, why doesn't it go immediately to gladdening the mind without having that intermediate step of the critical parent? Coming in with their critical thinking and critical mind of the— it's actually kind of a put-down. You haven't been gladdening the mind, and that thought moment could have been gladdening the mind instead of fussing at yourself for not gladdening the mind. So this is why we're talking about this is a pretty fast operation. Can you catch it so that when you wake up, can you wake up directly into the practice of gladdening the mind? Or do you have to go to that step of waking, seeing, fussing at yourself and complaining, and then waking up again and now gladdening the mind? Yes, there are steps that you can interfere or that you can remove in there. But this is the habit of the mind, is that whenever you remember something, you are complaining because you didn't remember it earlier. But while you're complaining about not remembering it earlier, you're still not doing it. Ah, okay. So that means just relax. We can, um, go through, uh, without spending much time on that intermediate step. Because I mean, look how long you could spend complaining at yourself about the fact how long has it been since you've been gladdening the mind. I mean, it's this way and it's that way, and we can fuss this way and fuss that way. What good was that Sati to remember to gladden the mind when all we got was a great big heap of complaining from the critical parent?

**Speaker A:** I think the complaint is kind of short though, because when I see it, as soon as I see it, I acknowledge that as a success and then I'm smiling like a split second afterward.

**Speaker B:** That's correct. That's the way to go. And the more you do it that way, see, if we in the old way, if we realize or we wake up and we see, and then we recognize that that's unwholesome or whatever, and now we start in complaining. There can be— and for you, for a long time, there was no end to it. You just complain and complain and complain about yourself or to yourself, whatever, like that. And so by doing so, we give it weight. We're practicing complaining. And you're already quite excellent at that particular song. And I'd say criticizing— criticizing and complaining are the same thing.

**Speaker A:** Oh really?

**Speaker B:** So, ah, sure. And so the sooner that we come out of that and start into the more wholesome behavior That means then that we're now practicing coming out of that critical complaining mind very quickly. That's the skill that we're wanting to develop. The wanting to develop is that right effort to come out of it.

**Speaker A:** And so are you saying that at times, if we will ourselves to it, what we could actually do is just skip that intermediary step of having that unwholesome thought and see the flash right before the unwholesome thought is about to arise. And then right there, just gladden the mind with feeling rather than thinking, "Oh, I can feel good right now." Instead of thinking I can feel good right now, just feel good right now. Just feel good right now. Because you're starting to get familiar with that feeling, and so you can just like kind of summon it.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. I will go direct to that thought moment of the feeling.

**Speaker A:** Feeling talk, right?

**Speaker B:** The same thing with the breathing. When I have the thought breathing, it doesn't even have to be a dialogue. Oh, you should take a deep breath. Takes longer than that in-breath, that the in-breath is happening and I don't have to think about it, just do it. Or the thinking is the initiation of the doing, not talking about doing it and then doing it. We just do it. We can breathe that discursive thought step out or make it very short. I think it doesn't have to— doesn't even have to be as long as it takes to have one sentence. You should be meditating, or you should be gladdening your mind. That takes all of those thought moments that we could just stop that stuff.

**Speaker A:** Oh, that's great.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So what you're saying now is I can give myself permission to not have to talk myself with thoughts, with words, with discursive thought into feeling good, because I know what that's like now. I have enough experience with that. So now I can actually begin to just kind of take a shortcut into the actual feeling, the wholesome sensation or experience of feeling good, of feeling wholesome, of relaxing or whatever it is. And then I can use that as my meditation object.

**Speaker B:** Well, especially in the sense that you're going to bypass the unwholesome thought of it's been a long time, or I should gladden the mind. 'Well, I should be meditating,' right? That thought is an unwholesome thought. And in the beginning, we have to see those things and then turn them around. Now what we're going to be doing is as soon as the Sati comes, instead of complaining about the loss of the Sati in the past, we can stop that whole process and just go right into the gladdening of the mind, but the gladdening of the mind is not necessarily discursive thought, right? Of gladdening the mind. It's just remembering to gladden the mind, remembering to come back to the breath and remembering to come back into the state of Sukkha. Now, the other thing that I've noticed is that that there is that thought moment of gladdening the mind, but it only was a tenth of a second.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** As opposed to the dialogue may take 2, 3, or 4 seconds. How long does it take to— you should be meditating. Those 4 words are actually, you know, 2, 3, 4 seconds.

**Speaker A:** So the throwing out of the Dukkha and the gladdening of the mind are actually one and the same. In this way. And just because precisely upon the Dukkha arising, gladdening of the mind happens. So essentially we're extinguishing Dukkha altogether, right?

**Speaker B:** So now you're beginning to understand just how fast the mind is and how empty Dukkha is and how empty it is precisely because in fact the mind is very, very fast. But we spend a lot of those mind moments talking ourselves into or complaining to ourselves about when we can just forget all of that. So, so you can have the mental image of the child, just, just an instant thought of a mental image, and be getting out of your chair in the next image without having to have the thought, oh, I should go check on my daughter. I just have a thought of her and I'm on the way. I don't have to go through that intermediate stage of the critical parents dialogue that in fact you can say now then, and this is the big one that's really surprising, is that that dialogue or that discursive thinking actually comes out of that part of the brain or that part of the mind that is labeled the critical parent. So whenever we're talking to ourselves, it's not in an observational point and it's not in a processing point. It's in that thing that the Buddha calls verbal Samskara. Now, unfortunately, there's no other way to teach the Dharma or any other subject other than that. But when we're not actually explaining things to each other, why is it that we have to explain things to ourselves? The answer to that is because when we were kids, our parents explained things to us. And so now we remember and we explain it to ourselves over and over and over again unnecessarily. Is verbal, and we can begin to cut that verbal stuff out so that we can go immediately to, let us say, one thought moment or a flash of an image or a very, very quick thought into action immediately without having to, let us say, pass a law in Congress to get it done.

**Speaker A:** There's a lot of passing in Congress that's been happening. Yeah. Yeah, that's actually what I was gonna— that's actually what I've noticed. It's been today, but it's been other days too, but I haven't been able to like describe it. And what it is, is that that thought might occur of, oh, I haven't been gladdening the mind. But then I'll like, I'll pause and I'll stop. I'll like stop everything and be really still. And I'll see that thought as really, it's gone already. Like, it's not even there. It's— there's nothing.

**Speaker B:** You stopped, it's gone. Of course it is. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well, there's like nothing. Like, in one moment, it looked like it was coloring my experience. But when I stopped, I could see that the thought was gone, like a cloud going over, and then the sun was there. And it was like, there's really nothing wrong here. But then what's interesting is that the intention to gladden the mind is also subdued. Because before, I was gladdening the mind to get away from the Dukkha, to get out of the Dukkha, to turn the Dukkha around, to transform it. But sometimes what happens is I can't tell if my mind is gladdened enough or if it should be gladdened more or what.

**Speaker B:** Because that's the thought, that's a doubt, rather than just experiencing it the way that it is. Now you're coming back with that critical parent and judging it. Is it this? Is it that? And that takes a lot of mind moments that we could just sit and do nothing, just let things stop.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so I guess my fear is that if I just do nothing I'll go into unwholesome thoughts, like, because do we have to keep gladdening the mind, or after a while can we just do nothing?

**Speaker B:** Like, yes, just do nothing. This is in fact what we've been practicing all along, or the way that I've been teaching all along, is that we investigate to see, is this thought unwholesome? Because quite often But see, in a way, you're in the future rather than in the present moment. So getting back to the present moment— is this thought wholesome? As we begin to practice Anapanasati, the answer is more and more often yes rather than no, right? Right. Yes, the mind is already wholesome. And so then the next one would be to say, ah, what a relief it is, the mind's already wholesome. I don't even have to take the effort to make it wholesome.

**Speaker A:** What if there are feeling tones that I can't tell? Like, it's not wholesome, but it's not unwholesome. It's like, it's vague.

**Speaker B:** Well, the vagueness— allow it to be vague, right?

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And that's okay, that this is big, because you come another vague and another vague, and it would become clear. But if you say, oh no, I don't like vague, I've got to go figure it out, now you're back into critical parent again in discursive thought, in doubt, rather than just allowing it to be vague.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And it seems that this doubt is really like, it's really the only thing that really nails my foot to the floor. Like, everything else I'm cool with. Like, I feel like aversion, anger, irritability, all these things, like, I have a pretty good control on those things. I don't, when I see them, I go the other way. But when it comes to doubt, it's sometimes obscure, it's sometimes vague. Sometimes I don't even know it's doubt. But I'm starting to see it more and get more familiar with it. And it's like that. It's like that one that shows up like you haven't been gladdening the mind. That's doubt, because it's like, when I look in my experience, there's really nothing wrong except for that thought.

**Speaker B:** But then the next one is— there never was everything wrong, but your parents, especially as your mom, was critical of you. And in a way, you had to resist her by saying, Mom, everything is all right. Look at what I've been doing in the past to prove that 'Everything is okay now.' Yeah, but you still picked up that habit and that dialogue from her. So now in your mind is both the critical mom and your answer to it. And this is what part of it is making it vague for you. But as you begin to see this dialogue that you have, you can say, 'Oh yeah, that's what's so vague about all of this is because it's actually be two different things that are in dialogue with each other. The critical parent is trying to find out everything that's wrong so that they can set it right. And the child in there is saying everything is already okay. This is why we begin to do it in the sense of nurturing, is to get that critical parent out of this critical dialogue into a nurturing dialogue. And so the nurturing dialog is the words, everything is okay, everything is fine. And we could use that kind of language. But the real feeling of Sukkha is not the thought everything is okay. The feeling of Sukkha is just the feeling of everything is okay, right? And it doesn't have a language built into it. And so that's one of the big problems that a lot of people have with Buddhism, is they don't understand how many different kinds of thoughts there are. But even with seeing, we can— with the eyes, there is looking, there is gazing, there is a dispersive kind of vision, and that Mostly when we talk about seeing, we want to know about what we see, the objects that we see, and then we give a description and we name it and all of that kind of stuff. And what we're talking about now is at the level of looking at how we see, or what is consciousness itself. So what we're beginning to do now is we're beginning to break up that issue of what we're talking about, cognitive thinking or cognizing, means that we're taking what we see, adding a bunch of stuff to it, like all of the groceries that come in the bag from the grocery store is not the food we eat. We've got to process it. And in fact, a lot of the groceries that are in that bag have already been a lot of processing done. Right. And what we're coming to is we're coming out of that processing, which is the critical parent is preparing the food or the perception so that we can cognize it or recognize it. Why can't we just recognize it directly without having to talk ourselves about it? That's the idea then, is that we can begin to notice or watch that we are looking. In other words, start looking at the mind moments that you're actually paying attention to what the eyes are doing, rather than looking for something that the eyes can see because the mind is looking for something instead of just kind of gazing. That's the way of looking, is to gaze. Now imagine it like this, that if the— let us say that the farmer is on this side of the field and he's plowing or looking down or whatever, and he looks up to rest and he just gazes at the woods across the field. So he's got a whole gaze. If he looks at this tree off in the distance, he will not see what's happening in this tree. But if he is gazing, then any movement that comes into his field of vision will become clear and obvious. They do that, in fact, with movies to a certain degree, that they'll show a scene and you don't get anything out of it until somebody moves. Snipers are like that. Okay. You can't see the sniper until he moves. But if you're looking for the sniper here, he can move all over the place over here and you don't see him. But when you open the eyes to gaze, now you can see that movement. Okay, so beginning to pay attention to how we use the eyes, because in the West we're taught to look specifically, to hone in on something. And so we practice meditation that same way, is to hone in on something. And we're inviting you now is to start to open it up. That in fact, that's doing it right now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, feel it.

**Speaker B:** You can feel that you can just expand your awareness because we're not homing in on it. Well, this is the problem with the— in meditation, using the word concentration, because concentration really has that quality of honing in. Which means that by honing in, we're going to miss all of this stuff that's out there. But Samadhi is a different word. Samatha means that we're going to not hone in on and separate other things. We're going to be there for all of it to come in. That Samatha is an opening, not a closing down, to where Concentration is a closing down, and it almost always has the closing down quality of adding discursive thought to it, because we're looking for something, and so we talk about what we're looking for and things like this, rather than just merely gazing. This is why it's so common language to say, just watch the show, because the show is all over the place. I mean, there's a whole lot of showing off. But, and this happens actually in theater, that a whole lot of stuff is happening in the scene here, and everybody is watching that stuff that's happening, Anagami or people like that. And a whole lot of other stuff is happening on the stage. By just looking at them. They're misdirected to look at this, to where there's all this other stuff. This is what you could call propaganda. Propaganda is say, go look at this and don't look at this. And that's quite necessary in all magic. Magic is mattering the practice of redirecting. Oh, don't think about this present moment because we've got rebirth and reincarnation and the Kamma and all of that kind of stuff. Go look at that instead of looking at what is. Wow.

**Speaker A:** That, that gazing thing is life-changing.

**Speaker B:** Learning to gaze. Another way of thinking about it is that an orchestra, let us say this is a concerto like Beethoven or Brahms' violin concerto, or maybe Tchaikovsky, and that the whole idea is for the orchestra to back up the violinist, and so everybody's paying attention mostly to the violinist. But the orchestra director, he is not paying so much attention to her, because he's got the whole orchestra there. And so, when we begin to listen to music, there's a difference between listening to music the way that most people listen to it, versus listening to it as if you were the conductor. In fact, that's something that I learned when I was in It was actually called Class C School when I was in the Navy. This is that, yes, I got to conduct a Navy band. That was part of the instructions. OK, but the whole point is now you've got to pay attention to a whole lot of stuff going on. Got to pay attention to a whole lot of stuff. You got to open up your mind so that you can hear what every instrument is doing. That's one of the reasons that I enjoy the music, is because it's so complex, because you've got 100 people doing things all at the same time. Can you hear the difference between what the violas and the violins are playing? Can you hear that beat of the timpani? Because Beethoven was really into timpanis. In fact, the really beautiful part about his violin concerto, especially the first movement, is that it looks like a dialogue between the timpani drums and the violin. But most people don't even catch that, because they're just listening to the violin. And here the whole thing starts off with boom, boom, boom, boom, and then the violin plays— You're sorry, because there's a whole lot of stuff going on. And so opening our mind, or that's the other way, um, remember we were talking about movies. Movies, the way that they're done is to get the audience to pay attention to what the director wants them to pay attention to. Their director is directing the audience's attention. But movie makers are not interested in what the director wants them to see. The other director is there analyzing everything that's going on. That's okay. That's the gazing. It's an opening quality. Would you say that the gazing at what people— go ahead.

**Speaker A:** Would you say that the gazing with the eyes is also a gazing with the mind too?

**Speaker B:** If we can learn to gaze with the eyes, we can begin to gaze with the mind too.

**Speaker A:** This is why they said in the book, the eyes are the senses. This is what you have to get to know, the senses as they actually are, the abilities of the senses, because they all harmonize. Wow, this is really great. This is really neat.

**Speaker B:** I remember several times, but one time specifically, walking down the pathway with Ajahn Po And he said, just listen, just listen. But I had already picked that up. I was able to pick up what he was saying really, really quickly because I had already spent time— actually, it was Chief Beaman Logan and Mad Bear, who was with the Tuskegee Indian Reservation in northern New York State. I went up there and spent several months with them. And what Keith Beaman Loong had taught me how to do was to listen in a brand new way that I'd never— I mean, I'd been in music all this time and whatnot, but learning to listen to the forest. And so that even when I'm talking to the students, if I hear a bird call or something like that, I might mention it because there's a whole lot of stuff happening all the time. And when You hear it? There it is again, right? So even though I'm paying attention and watching you and looking at your facial expressions and whatnot like that, I can still hear the cars, I can still hear the birds, I can still feel the fan, because we don't attach to anything. We let go of everything that's happening in the moment so that we could be there for all of the stuff that's happening, because there is just so much happening all the time. If we gaze, we can see it move. And so we gaze with the ears, we gaze with the eyes, and we gaze with the mind. We're never taught that in school. We're taught to focus.

**Speaker A:** I can hear the heater. In my house, that's the forest for me. As soon as you said that, it clicked. I was like, oh, the background, everything that's going on.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, pay attention to all of the back because it's not in the background. It's there.

**Speaker A:** It's here. Yeah, it's all here.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. The reason that we call it the background is because we're focused on the foreground. And the idea is let's not focus on anything. Let's be there for whatever is happening. And whatever is happening will happen in the sense of something new, some movement. And so when we think about the Anicca, the mind, we could just, oh yeah, that's right, we can just go right to it without having to go through that dialogue that we've set up, which is the foreground.

**Speaker A:** Lifting weights.

**Speaker B:** Right. Let's stop with the foreground and just pay attention to the whole show. Yeah, what is it? Is that you don't have to pay attention to the other stuff that's going on, right? The directed, uh, the director's point. In other words, the director of the movie is directing you to look at, uh, these— even though you've got the whole laptop screen here, just one little thing on there is what the director wants you to look at. The idea is, can you see everything that's happening there, including the stuff that the director is ignoring? Because he's wanting you to pay attention to what's there. So when I talk to students, I'll notice the background. If they've got pictures up, what colors are they? Like that. In fact, I had a dialogue with Robert about that, and the next day he had changed all the stuff. And so this is the way of opening up. And so many people practice meditation by closing down. They say you're supposed to pay attention. Yeah, what you're paying attention to? Too few things. A better way of doing it is pay attention, but not pay attention to something, but rather to pay attention in general. It's an opening. There's that whippoorwill again. And it takes a while for students to begin to understand this. It's this long, slow process of recognizing that basically we need to come out of this discursive talking that we're doing to ourselves. It basically is almost always critical.

**Speaker A:** So from the gazing mind and from the gazing eyes, when Dukkha comes up, is it handled differently now?

**Speaker B:** No, that was in fact attaching to something specific. That's what the Dukkha is. Is that we attach to something specific with feelings about that. And when we don't attach to anything, then we're gazing, because we're not attaching to anything in particular. Going back to the movie with the director, the director wants to direct that movie for the audience to pay attention to this a particular thing, right? And we attach to that, and we watch that, and then we fail to recognize all the other stuff that's happening on the stage or on the scene. Then in fact, it's only in really old movies that you'll see shadows of boom mics, because they've got better microphone technology now than they did in the old days. But they still have windows that have no glass. Why would they have windows without any glass? Well, because these are stored props in Hollywood's back lot, you see, and they want to set that thing up very easily and very quickly. And glass is the heaviest part of a window, so why should you have windows? Because all you need is the illusion of a window, not a real window. And if you look at that, you can see all kinds of things. If you begin to look at movies in a completely different way, you want to gaze at the movie and see, just, you know, there's all kinds of things that don't fit. Another example is a period movie with people in period clothing that is obviously and clearly newly manufactured. It's not authentic. Like buttons and things like that. When people didn't have buttons 500 years ago, they had little pieces of wood. The button was about like this size, and you'd have to take it and twist it to get it through the buttonhole. Now with round buttons, you have to almost destroy the cloth. To where in the old days, a button was used, you had to twist the button button, not the cloth. There's all kinds of things like that. By the way, you also know that the girls' buttons are on this side and the boys' buttons are on this side. Yeah, in the old days that wasn't the case, and yet they still follow that tradition because that— I don't know when that tradition got in there, is probably some chauvinistic thing. But there's all kinds of things, just, just, it's just amazing how much stuff can be seen if we're not looking at what we're supposed to look at.

**Speaker A:** Wow.

**Speaker B:** But our whole society has taught us to look in that narrow-focused concentrated way rather than opening the gaze completely. This is why folks like Ajaan Po and good meditators, it's really hard to sneak up on because they're never focused on anything enough that they're not aware of the background. They're not aware of the thing.

**Speaker A:** That's cool.

**Speaker B:** So from this perspective, ordinary people, you could sneak up on them so easy, especially if you already gained quietude. And that happens in our house all the time. The one of Thay's often words would be tok jai or plek jai. One, they mean the same thing. One is an Eastern word and the other one is a Thai word, but tok jai means my heart has dropped, and plek jai means that the heart has been moved. But they both have the quality of surprise. Okay, so they both mean the word surprise, and I surprise her a lot because there I am and she wasn't paying attention. And so I do that with Kitty. That's been one of the trainings that I've had with her, is to sneak up on her and tickle her, sneak up on her and grab her snail phone. And now I can't get in the same room with her. Why? Because she has gotten that awareness of opening up. Even though she's really interested in the cell phone, she knows that Daddy it may be coming in. And so she's got that open opening awareness. Yeah. So I'm teaching it to her naturally. But Achan Po did that also with me. I've gotten— I've said many times the stories about how he got me to open up by sneaking up on me. And so that's a The process, I think that that's an amazing thing that's missing for Western meditation groups is because of this issue of concentrating and focusing the mind. And then they miss the whole point about what we're doing here is we're not learning to focus it so that we keep it focused. We're learning to focus it to stop it. From moving from this object to this object, this stops so that it can open up. And so I use this example: this is the mind, is like this all over the place, and the correct practice is to keep coming back and keep pointing until we get more and more familiar with it. And so we keep coming back like this, and finally it settles down. And after we do that then we can draw back and gauge. And yet most people say, oh, I've got to get it, I've got to get it. And so what they do is that they want to try to do this and push and push so that they've really got that object. This is kind of the way that you were practicing, rather than— no, what we want to do is to stop, to draw back, and to see the whole show. So when Shakespeare says, "All the world's a stage and everyone is a player," you could imagine that there you are on stage and you're reading your script. That's what your show is, is you're reading the script. What script do you read? The one that you were given when you were a child. And we're all on stage reading our script and not paying attention to what's going on on stage. And so what we can do is that we can, once we recognize that, hey, I don't have to be on stage, I don't have to be reading the script, I can go sit in the audience and just enjoy the show. And so we begin to open our perspective. Now what that also means is very, very closely related now, because I've been using it in one kind of language But really what we're talking about is the Paticcasamuppada, that we're beginning to pay attention not to the cognizing, which is what we pay attention to mostly, is what did I figure out? What do I see there? And now we're beginning to look at it in the sense of the process. How did I come up with that? What was the input? And so we begin to actually investigate perception itself, knowing that when we could bring perception to an end, that means that we're still taking in input, we still have the consciousness of the sensing organs in operation, but we're not grabbing a hold of something and trying to make sense out of it so that we know how to feel about that, and we're just there for everything. Whatever the senses presents, just watch that, because those senses are going to continue to present stuff one by one as they occur. At this moment, I'm thinking about my arm, and I think about the wind that's blowing on it, and then I'm thinking about the muscle. And I say thinking because I'm not actually using language to think about— I'm experiencing instead of thinking. So that would be another way of talking about what is an experience— is just another way of thinking, but it's not discursive thinking, it's observational thinking. And we want to do a whole lot of observing, observing with the body, with the eyes, with the ears, with them, uh, when we're eating food, to really pay attention to all the stuff that's happening inside the mouth. I mean, when you're chewing food, there's 10 or 20 million different things happening inside the mouth, just popping all over the place.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the experience of eating is incredible.

**Speaker B:** But most of the time we're eating but not experiencing eating, right? We're thinking about that or something else, or having a conversation with someone or whatnot like that. When in fact eating itself is a marvelous experience.

**Speaker A:** It is. I've been— that's actually prematurely something that I've been tapping into. Whenever I eat, I just get so lost in the sensations. I'm not there. I'm just enjoying the sensations. I'm not thinking about the food. I'm not thinking about even what the food is. I'm just tasting it all.

**Speaker B:** And it's right then. In fact, when someone is eating or drinking, that's the easiest time to sneak up on them. That's the only time that ever been able to sneak up on Ajahn Po is when he's eating.

**Speaker A:** That's true. It's very easy to sneak up on someone when they're eating, if they're really eating.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So today we have been talking about this idea of why do we have to have a whole conversation in the mind, just at the point of Sati, when we can go from the Sati immediately into the gladdening of the mind and the rest. And that gladdening now doesn't even have to be verbal. We don't have to say things like everything is all right, because everything is all right, it takes 2, 3, 4 seconds to say it. When we can have that feeling or the thought feeling of everything really is all right. And so we can immediately just go into that relaxation. So begin to watch how we— how we, uh, let us say it like this, a running dialogue, or another way of saying it is a blow-by-blow description Or like that, we become a radio announcer to announce everything that's happening in our life. Then in fact, in the old days at baseball games and football games, they had an announcer because it was only on radio. Why, when now we've got television, do we still have announcers at a football game? They're completely useless, and there they are just yabbering and jabbering, and they were missing themselves, missing off on some of the action that's happening on the We can see the ridiculousness of the announcers for that. We can also see that the announcers in the news studio are often also misdirecting us. They're yabbering about something. This completely unimportant, but it gives the mind something to attach to. And so now you're beginning to recognize we can live our lives perfectly well without having that running dialogue. So beginning to pay attention to that running dialogue in the sense that we don't need that, we can go directly into feeling good. I don't have to talk myself into it with language. I can talk myself into it with a more pure, faster, even more wholesome kind of thought of just doing it. Just is it. And the problem is you can't put it into words. I'm talking about something that can't be talked about. So that's, by the way, that's the opening line of the Tao Te Ching, the The Tao that can be spoken is not the Tao. And so we're working on using words like gazing to give that real sense that the Tao is open, and dialogue is closed. And we think that we're supposed to close things down, that's why we talk about it in the sense of Concentration.

**Speaker A:** Now, does this gaze— when you first told me just try gazing, immediately I was able to experience what that was like. But as I've gazed more and more and more, I've noticed the tendency to make it a thing, like, oh, this is my freedom now, this is my relief now.

**Speaker B:** That's the dialogue though.

**Speaker A:** That's the dialogue.

**Speaker B:** That's the dialogue. Okay, so recognize that dialogue and say, hey, I don't have to talk about gazing to myself, I could just do it. Just do it. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And then I noticed that like sometimes I'm getting more like sucked into your— that tunnel. So how can I like make sure that I'm still keeping that gaze?

**Speaker B:** Just remember That's the whole point. That's what Sati is about, is remember to not attach to things, even visual objects, and tell ourselves a story about it in order to understand it and take control over it. But rather just leave things vague. It's okay for things to be vague. You don't have to figure it out. Just enjoy the show.

**Speaker A:** So it's something to play with, right? Because I'm probably not going to have like a perfect gaze all the time.

**Speaker B:** Oh, No, it's a, it's a toy, a new toy to play with. Okay. All right.

**Speaker A:** Oh hey, I have a question, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** When you say all are coming in, so let's make it short and then we'll, um— Okay.

**Speaker A:** When you say everything is in turmoil, what do you mean by that?

**Speaker B:** In flux, in movement, that nothing is fixed except the human mind when it attaches to something. The things are constantly in motion. This is what the Buddha means by Anicca, is everything is moving, nothing is solid, everything is in motion. Pay attention to it being in motion. That's what we mean. Everything is in turmoil. Everything is in motion. The wind around you is in motion. The wind in front of your desk is more in motion than the wind behind you because of your own breathing. You'd be surprised at how many billions of molecules have to move out of the way just because you're breathing. You set all kinds of things in motion with your breath. And so we can enjoy that show too.

**Speaker A:** Are we fixing— are we getting fixed the view of enjoying the show, or is that in motion as well?

**Speaker B:** That's also in motion, playing with it, because you— and one of the motions that it can take is back into telling us our story about it. And so see that too. See that now we're not just seeing something, but we're telling a story about it. That storytelling, that's the cognition.

**Speaker A:** So that's the new Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's the new Dukkha, is whatever we're attaching to, trying to figure out how to feel about it. Do I like it? Do I not like it? So that's the beginning of that process. But when we're just open at just receiving data without processing, with the intent to label it and find out what it is so that we'll know how to feel about it. That's the end. That's the whole end of it, is just to be in the present moment completely without attaching to any item that comes by in the present moment.

**Speaker A:** So liking and not liking is attaching too.

**Speaker B:** That's the whole point, exactly. That's the attachment. The exact thing.

**Speaker A:** So good. I've started to notice this with food and stuff when we pick what we want to eat or what we want to watch. I'm like looking at it and I can see like making it so important. I need to like this, it's imperative, it's important. And I'm starting to just be like, no, that's okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, just enjoy.

**Speaker A:** Do away with that one.

**Speaker B:** Right, you don't have to like it.

**Speaker A:** It doesn't matter what I pick to eat because thinking about it isn't going to make it enjoyable. Like, it doesn't really actually matter.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. Cool. Okay, excellent. We'll keep going. Keep enjoying, keep gazing, keep just letting things happen. Okay, just enjoy the show. All right, see you later.

**Speaker A:** All right, thank you, Dhammarato. Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) in dialogue with a student (Speaker A), focuses on moving beyond discursive thought to a more direct, experiential understanding of the mind and reality. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: Moving Beyond Discursive Thought**
The central teaching is that we spend too much time in **verbal, narrative thinking** (the "critical parent" or "running dialogue"), which slows down and clouds our direct experience. True practice involves shifting to faster, non-verbal, and more wholesome modes of awareness.

### **Key Insights and Instructions**

1.  **Thought is More Than Language:** "Thought" includes all mind moments—not just internal dialogue, but also sensations, images, and direct perceptions (e.g., feeling headphones without describing them). Verbal thought is slow and conceptual compared to the speed of direct experience.

2.  **Manage the Mind by Using It Less:** The mind is the most frequently used sense, not necessarily the most important. Managing it means **using discursive thought less** and **using direct observation through the senses more**. This reduces the stories we tell ourselves about our experience.

3.  **Shortcut to Wholesome States:** When you remember (Sati) to "gladden the mind" or return to the breath, **skip the intermediate, critical step** (e.g., "I haven't been meditating"). Go directly to the **feeling** of gladness or the **sensation** of the breath. This bypasses unwholesome self-criticism and doubt.

4.  **Doubt is a Habit of Cognizing:** Doubt arises from excessive "cognizing"—processing and labeling experience instead of just observing it. The solution is to **"look and not do so much cognizing."** Allow experience to be vague; you don't need to figure everything out.

5.  **Practice "Gazing," Not "Concentrating":**
    *   **Concentration** (as commonly understood) is a narrow, focused, closing-down of awareness—like homing in on one thing. It often involves discursive thought ("looking for something").
    *   **Samadhi/Samatha** (as taught here) is an **open, receptive "gazing."** It involves expanding awareness to take in the entire field of experience—sights, sounds, bodily sensations—without attaching to any one thing. This is compared to a conductor hearing the whole orchestra, a sniper noticing any movement, or watching a movie while seeing *everything* on set, not just what the director points to.

6.  **Everything is in Motion (Anicca):** Reality is in constant flux ("turmoil"). Suffering (Dukkha) arises when we **attach** to something within that flux, try to fix it, label it, and decide if we like or dislike it. The goal is to be in the present moment, receiving sensory data without this processing and attaching.

7.  **Enjoy the Show:** The ultimate attitude is to **"just enjoy the show."** Life is a constantly changing process. By letting go of the narrating, critical mind and opening into a gentle gaze, we can be present for all of it without the burden of constant commentary and judgment.

### **Practical Takeaways**
*   **Catch the critical self-talk** and consciously shorten or bypass it.
*   **Cultivate direct feeling** (e.g., of gladness or relaxation) without verbal prompting.
*   **Practice "gazing"** in daily life: open your awareness to all senses simultaneously without focusing narrowly.
*   **Allow experience to be vague;** don't feel the need to cognitively resolve everything.
*   **See liking/disliking as a form of attachment** that creates Dukkha.
*   Understand that **the mind is incredibly fast**; suffering is often empty and can be dropped in an instant when seen clearly.

The talk emphasizes that this approach—shifting from a concentrated, narrative-based mind to an open, gazing, experiential awareness—is a more effective and joyful path to ending suffering.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several core metaphors and stories to explain mindfulness, perception, and meditation practice. Here is a breakdown:

### **Core Metaphors**

1.  **The Mind as a Fast Processor vs. a Slow Narrator:**
    *   **Metaphor:** Discursive, verbal thought is described as a slow, inefficient way to process experience. It's compared to "passing a law in Congress" to get something done, or a "radio announcer" giving a blow-by-blow description of a game you can already see.
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate that direct experience (feeling, sensing, acting) is faster and more immediate than the internal story we tell ourselves about it.

2.  **"Gazing" vs. "Focusing" or "Honing In":**
    *   **Metaphor:** True awareness (**Samadhi/Samatha**) is likened to **"gazing"**—an open, receptive, panoramic awareness where you take in the entire field without attaching to any one thing. This is contrasted with **"concentration,"** which is portrayed as "honing in," "focusing," or "closing down" like a spotlight, which causes you to miss the broader context.
    *   **Purpose:** To shift the understanding of meditation from forceful concentration to relaxed, inclusive awareness.

3.  **The "Critical Parent" Internal Voice:**
    *   **Metaphor:** The habitual, self-critical, discursive inner monologue is personified as the **"critical parent."** This voice explains things, fusses, complains, and judges ("You haven't been gladdening the mind").
    *   **Purpose:** To help identify and dis-identify from the automatic judgmental thinking that creates suffering, and to encourage moving directly to nurturing, wholesome states instead.

4.  **Life as a Stage or a Movie:**
    *   **Metaphor:** Our ordinary, attached state is like being an **actor on stage, reading a script** (our conditioned habits) and only seeing our own part. Waking up is like going to **sit in the audience and just enjoy the whole show**.
    *   **Related Movie Metaphor:** A movie director directs the audience's attention to specific plot points (propaganda), but a keen observer ("gazing") can see everything else—the boom mic shadows, the fake windows, the anachronistic buttons. Our mind does the same, focusing us on "the story" and missing the raw data of reality.
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate the difference between being lost in our personal narrative (dukkha) and having a detached, observational awareness of the entire field of experience (the end of dukkha).

5.  **Senses as Input Channels, Cognition as "Processing Groceries":**
    *   **Metaphor:** The six senses (eyes, ears, etc.) are the ABCs, the foundational inputs. Cognition is likened to **bringing groceries home and processing them**—adding labels, stories, and judgments to the raw sensory "food."
    *   **Purpose:** To distinguish between pure sensory experience and the mental fabrication we layer on top of it, which is where attachment and suffering arise.

6.  **Dukkha as a Cloud, Awareness as the Sun:**
    *   **Metaphor:** A negative thought or moment of dukkha is like a **cloud passing over the sun**. When you stop and look (gaze), you see the cloud is already gone, and the "sun" of okay-ness was always there.
    *   **Purpose:** To show the ephemeral, empty nature of negative mental states and the ever-present possibility of clarity.

### **Stories and Anecdotes**

1.  **The Child Falling:**
    *   **Story:** You see a child fall across the room. Without the thought "I must help," you are already out of your chair and moving. Action happens directly from perception, bypassing the internal narrator.
    *   **Purpose:** To demonstrate that swift, wholesome action does not require discursive thought; it can arise from direct seeing/feeling.

2.  **Sneaking Up on People (Ajahn Po, the speaker's daughter Kitty):**
    *   **Story:** The teacher (Dhammarato) talks about sneaking up on his teacher, Ajahn Po, and now playfully sneaking up on his own daughter. He notes it's easiest to sneak up on someone when they are eating—deeply focused on one sense object.
    *   **Purpose:** To show that "gazing" open awareness makes you less susceptible to being startled or unaware of your environment, and that focused concentration ("honing in") creates vulnerability and blind spots.

3.  **Conducting an Orchestra:**
    *   **Story:** The speaker references learning to conduct a Navy band. A conductor doesn't just listen to the soloist (the violin); they must be aware of the **entire orchestra**—the violas, the timpani, all the complex layers happening at once.
    *   **Purpose:** To exemplify "gazing" with the ears and mind—holding a wide, inclusive awareness that takes in the whole of experience without getting stuck on one element.

4.  **Listening to the Forest with Native Teachers:**
    *   **Story:** The speaker mentions learning from Chief Beaman Logan and Mad Bear to "listen to the forest in a brand new way," hearing all the layers of sound simultaneously.
    *   **Purpose:** To ground the concept of open awareness in a natural, non-meditative context and show it as a learnable skill of perception.

### **Summary of Key Contrasts Presented Through Metaphors:**
*   **Fast, direct experience** vs. **Slow, verbal narration**.
*   **Open gazing (Samadhi)** vs. **Narrow focusing (Concentration)**.
*   **Being the audience enjoying the show** vs. **Being the actor stuck in a script**.
*   **Raw sensory data** vs. **Processed, labeled "groceries" of cognition**.
*   **The nurturing mind** vs. **The "critical parent" mind**.

The central teaching is that freedom comes from shifting from the latter to the former in each pair—bypassing the slow, critical narrator to access a faster, more open, and directly experiential way of being.
