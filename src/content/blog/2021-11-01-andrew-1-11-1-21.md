### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So welcome, Andrew. This is our first call, second time we tried the video, so we'll go from there. We started into talking about Western Buddhism and how some of the things that are missing And we could go— actually, one of the ways that I describe it is like the actual teachings of the Buddha are like a jigsaw puzzle, and we have to get a few pieces at a time and put that puzzle together. And when we get the puzzle together, we understand things completely. And that Western Buddhism is that same jigsaw puzzle with a couple of pieces gone. There's an old song about that. Leroy Brown is like a junkyard dog with a couple of pieces, right? Okay, so this is what we're talking about. And that the actual teachings of the Buddha are actually centralized around his one point that he said— this means several suttas— that he teaches only one thing. And that is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. And yet the way that the Mahayana practice is, is Dukkha, look at Dukkha, inspect Dukkha, really get a load of Dukkha, chase down, beat it down, and really understand Dukkha. Yeah. And with the choiceless awareness, that is all there is to Dukkha. Well, there it is again. Well, there it is again. Okay. And neither one of these are the teachings of the Buddha. The Buddha taught Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. And when we say Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, we're not talking about a 30-year span of 25 years of Dukkha and 5 years of Dukkha, Nirodha. That's not the way that it's all set up, but rather see the Dukkha right now and come out of the Dukkha right now. That's the real teaching of the Buddha. And that we do this with the Eightfold Noble Path, and we do this with actually the Four Noble Truths, because the Four Noble Truths is nothing but the teaching of Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha unpacked slightly. It's almost like that the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Noble Path, is all folded up into just into one statement or one sentence. The entire teachings of the Buddha is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. But we can find other ways of giving the entire path. The one that I like is coming out of a reggae song called Don't Worry, Be Happy. And that's exactly the whole show. That's the entire teaching. Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha is don't worry, be happy. Now this "don't worry" means the Second Noble Truth in the sense of what is the cause of suffering is worry. It's not the only one, but basically you could go so far as to say that's a kind of a bucket or a sign for the whole thing. That basically all the suffering comes from a kind of worrying, finding things that are wrong, and having unwholesome thoughts that lead them to breed ill will and delusions. So one of the things about Western Buddhism, for most Westerners, it seems really, really complicated. You have to produce these 3 totes, of them things, 3 more of that, 5 of this, 6 of those, 8 of them things, 12 of this. 16 of the stages of insight, and these stages of Anapanasati, and it's all good. But basically, it's a good idea then to take it in the original teachings down to something that's very simple and pass that on to the students and then help them unpack that so that they can see all of the complexity. Because the complexity is not in the teaching of the Buddha, it's in the complexity of the mind. And we use the teaching of the Buddha to unpack the mind and see all the complexities and sort of tweak it and whatnot like that. That you could go so far as to say that when a product comes out, later editions of that product sometimes are going to be more complicated and more sophisticated, but in other cases it's going to be more simple and yet more sophisticated. An example of that would be like with the new Tesla automobiles, they're going to have the whole frame down to just one piece. Right now in most builds, it's several thousand parts, including bolts and washers and all kinds of things. And so the whole point though of a car, never mind how complex they are, they only really have one easy-looking feature, and that is transportation. That's all they do. So that's what we're looking for here, is the only thing that we're going to get out of Buddhism is the transportation out of dissatisfaction and unwholesomeness into satisfaction and into wholesomeness. That's all. Yet most of the people from the West, because of the tradition of Christianity and all kinds of other things, are expecting Buddhism to be so much more. That in fact, they expected that Buddhism is going to, let us say, compete with Christianity It's got to be as big and grand and grandiose and out of sight as Christianity is in order to compete. Basically, we're talking about the difference between a marble and a boulder. And a marble is a whole lot easier to manage and carry around, and a boulder is rough and all of that kind of stuff, as well as heavy. So, if we can understand from the very beginning that the teachings of the Buddha is actually quite simple, and there's not much to it. That means that then much of the time that you and I spend in relationship with each other is a friendly jog through a vast territory of mentality, and start applying these very, very simple rules to it to straighten the whole thing out. And so this is the way that we look at it, that the basic teaching of Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha then unpacks into the Four Noble Truths, which needs some time to express them, because a lot of people have the idea that life itself is dissatisfying, that life is Dukkha. We can get that in the sense that many Christians have the idea that, oh, this life life is just a waiting station, that the real thing happens after you're dead. All right, what that tends to have, that general mentality, is that this life is not worth anything. And yet the reality of the situation would be that if I would hold a gun to your head and give you two choices— you can either die in this minute or you can wait 10 minutes and then die— which would you choose? The latter. All right, so that proves then that you would rather keep your life, that life itself is precious. And yet a whole lot of teachings have to do with this life is not precious, that you're going to have another life that's going to be better than that some other time. And so this whole idea of life after death, that is also similar to a teaching in Hinduism about reincarnation, sounds very delicious to the ordinary person who finds this life full of suffering and they would like to have a life that's free from that suffering. Well, the teaching of the Buddha is, yes, let's do that right now. Let's do it right now and do it again and do it again and do it again. But the real issue though is that this dissatisfaction has a cause, it's got a source, there's got reasons behind it, but it's not life itself that is Dukkha. That in fact, the word Dukkha itself is badly translated. One of the bigger problems with modern Western Buddhism is the bad translations of what the Buddha actually was saying has been bent by words and by culture and by all kinds of things, including a whole lot of people. When they actually understand the teachings of the Buddha, they don't like it at all because they can't make a profit off of it. The preacher man can say, oh, give me all your money and I'll help you get into heaven. But the Buddhist teachers don't really need any money because they're already happy. You can see that in fact the preacher man is still in a kind of hell that has not enough money in it, so he wants your money. So at least the preacher at the church is smarter than most of the parishioners, that the wise people who would come to church would be like Homer Simpson and take money out of the plate rather than put it in. And so, this whole idea then that the cause of suffering is not something magical and mystical, it's not a preview of the religions or anything, but in fact what makes a religion is wrong answers to wrong questions. And so, speculations, the speculated answers about speculated questions is why we go down these rabbit holes. And one of the reasons why we will go down a certain rabbit hole is that the rabbit hole is falsely labeled because of a bad translation. And so you can see how Christianity had a major influence on Buddhism right from the very beginning, because the worst word— the first word of Buddhism is is wrongly translated into the word suffering. But in fact, you and I can sit here and kind of agree that right now we're not suffering. That in fact, if you had a Jehovah's Witness style Buddhism where they carry tracts and knocked on people's doors and asked, "Are you suffering?" Nobody will say, "I'm suffering." Couldn't give a tract to anybody, "I can solve your suffering." "Well, I'm not suffering." But if you ask the question, are you ever dissatisfied? Now the answer is yes. Yes, I'm dissatisfied often, but I'm not suffering. I'm just dissatisfied. Well, this is what the Buddha is actually looking at, is that dissatisfaction. But a lot of Westerners think that they're trying to eliminate suffering, something really, really big, where in fact, no, we're just looking the little stuff. Okay, this is an important point. Now, what is the cause of this suffering is actually stuff that we're doing, that we cause the suffering. We do it, we cause the dissatisfaction, and we do it by wanting things that we don't have, or putting— not wanting to put up with things that we find hard to put up with. Which is normally called greed, ill will, and delusion. Now, in the Mahayana, they've gone so far as to change that into it's done by clinging. But clinging is a bit different. The clinging is full-blown to where the original point was that we wanted something that we didn't have. And the reason that that's true— and this has been true throughout human history— that we want something and then we go get it, thinking that if we get what we want, the feeling of want goes away. But it doesn't. If we want something and we get it, then that feeling of wanting will just be placed onto something else until we get that, and then we want something else. Not only that, but once we get something, it's probably going to fall heart. And now we're subject to grief over the loss of that which we thought was money. So the— and so that loss is often met with ill will and anger over the loss of something that was going to be lost anyway, because everything is temporary. Everything is temporary. And so anything that we get in order to feel good, we're going to lose that and then go back and feel bad again. That sequence, we don't see it. And because we don't see it, we act ignorantly, and often we even act out of delusion in the sense that we think we know what's right when in fact we are completely wrong, that when we're mistaken, but we cling to the mistake. It's very interesting that when two people get in an argument Generally, the case is, is that they're arguing over something that neither one of them have absolute knowledge and proof over. An example of that is when two guys are fighting over whose sports team or whose athlete is better, because the criteria for how we select who is better is changing. In other words, I can, I can set up the criteria so that this sport team wins my heart, and the criteria over here I can set up so that this sport team wins my heart. So now you've got two different people with two different criteria going in and saying my sport team is better than yours, and they get into a great big argument. All right, someone who is completely disinterested in sports is unlikely to get into that argument. Right. It's also possible that maybe one of the owners of one of the star teams just happens to be in the same bar where this argument is happening. It's unlikely because of his deep knowledge and understanding. He's not going to get into that argument. There's just a couple of fools over there arguing. Okay, so what I'm getting at is that direct Knowledge, deep knowledge doesn't argue. It's only people who are in doubt will argue with each other. Well, that's the ignorance then. The ignorance is what helps create the ill will. When you know something is true, there's no argument about it. It's just there it is. Now the question is, do you like it or not? And if it doesn't matter then everything is good. But when we're unsure, we wind up in arguments trying to find out. And so this ignorance, which leads to doubt, is one of the issues of the cause of suffering, as our cause of Dukkha, as well as the issue of— because we're ignorant about our greed Our greed then is created by ignorance. Our ill will is created by ignorance, and our doubts are created by ignorance. And so if you really begin to see what's going on, we're going to get an advantage here. And this is what the Mahasi Method was originally all about, is really look at what's going on. Okay, so this is the second noble truth. The third noble truth is almost never mentioned, never talked about. Because they don't really understand what it is. Well, if you don't understand where you're going, the likelihood of you winding up there is kind of remote, right? If you don't know where you're going, then even if you get where you're going, you won't know that because you didn't recognize where you're going in the first place. And so it's kind of important for the student to begin to understand what the this third noble truth is, and that is to get yourself into a state of satisfaction as opposed to being in a state of unsatisfying. We find something that's satisfying. And this is not done for years and years later. You'll find many, many people with the idea that one thing they'll say is that, "Oh, there haven't been enlightened beings for centuries." We've got to go figure it all out because there's no teachers left. They've all died. That's one of the ways that they say it. Another one is, uh, and this is basically the idea of pragmatic Buddhism, is that there's got to be a pony in that set of suttas someplace. You can only figure it out. What they don't understand is, is that in Asia they've known it for centuries. They already have figured it out. But it hasn't translated well into Western Buddhism yet. So, and part of the problem is translations, but the bigger problem is, is that all the teachers who are teaching English and teaching from the West never got the real training that they needed in the first place. Most of the really famous ones only spent a year or two in the the robes only a year or two in Burma. They couldn't stand it, but they liked the Dharma enough to come back and want to build a whole career over it. But they did so with more of their Western influence than they did in the Asian influence. So the whole point about the Third Noble Truth is to practice meditation to get ourselves into a state of satisfaction. Rather than being always dissatisfied. Now there's a method of getting oneself into a state of satisfaction, and that is the Eightfold Noble Path with its supports and requirements and features. Now a lot of people start off Buddhism with the three points of Sila, Samatha, Panna. Have you ever heard heard of Sila, Samatha, and Pañña? Okay, that's what ordinary people practice. We teach Sila even in Thailand to the children. The Sila is the morality, okay? And they say in some places, in some organizations, they say, oh, if you're going to practice this way, then that means that you have to you spend 5 or 10 years as a monk just watching your behavior, and when you get your behavior purified, then you can go and practice some Samadhi, and you do that for another 10 or 20 years, and when you get that done, then you can practice purification of view. But that's not the way that the Buddha taught. No, they're taught 1, 2, 3. The first thing you do is you get into seclusion. Because if you're not around other people, if you're sitting there quietly wherever you are with your eyes closed and your legs folded and your hands folded and you're doing nothing, then your Sila right then and there is perfect enough. So getting away from it all and getting into seclusion, that's the easy way of getting your Sila perfect, except for one thing. It's really difficult to be pure in Sila if you're sitting there on the floor in the meditation hall planning to rob the bank or planning to stab the teacher in the back or planning to do this and that or the other thing. And so a deeper purification of that Sila would be then the purification of the mind itself, which is the whole point. So we get away from it all so that we can get secluded enough to get away from it all. Another way of talking about it is that we bring the world with us, that when we go into seclusion, we get away from the world only to find out that in that process we brought the world with us. Sort of like I want to get away from all my baggage, and so I pack my bags and take them and leave. But so got all my baggage, I brought it with me. I brought my suitcases, my backpacks, and all of that kind of stuff. So the Eightfold Noble Path basically has some supports to it that need to be investigated and understood. And the first one, in fact, is investigation, that one's right view Often, in fact, I've made the mistake when I was reading the suttas, I was saying, okay, well, I know what wrong view is and I know what ordinary right view is, but what is noble right view? There's no noble right view there. What it is is instead an investigation. That noble right view is not a viewpoint, it's a viewing. That's another bad translation. Okay, that is, that actually the word that would be better would be investigation rather than holding views. Holding views is a concept, okay? Conceptualized mind. That basically what the conceptualized mind or concepts is, is that we create an imaginary world and think that it's real. That's what a concept is. And what we're practicing is, is to stop those concepts and come into reality right here, right now. So coming out of the conceptualized mind— and yet the Mahasi Method promotes conceptualizations— and so what we're going to do is practice a little differently by practicing actually the Eightfold Noble Path. And that starts off with an investigation. But how do you get an investigation even started? In other words, when are you going to look? The answer is whenever you remember to look. But that's Sati. You have to remember to come back and be here now. You have to remember to be be able to do it. Then we do the investigation. So now we've got two aspects of the Eightfold Noble Path. You have to remember to look, and then you have to look. But this looking is an investigation. It's sort of like, um, you know the story about Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson?

**Speaker B:** Uh, sure, yeah, I mean, I know

**Speaker A:** you've heard about them. Yeah, you know about the Okay, so there you find Sherlock Holmes with his magnifying glass out inspecting every little thing in the room, in this crime scene, where Dr. Watson is musing over who used to live there and what kind of lifestyle they had like that. And he's absolutely completely flabbergasted that Sherlock Holmes can get all this information by actually investigating. And actually looking rather than musing over what's the possibilities. And this is what we're practicing here, is the actual investigation of the evidence of a crime scene, our own crime scene. What is that crime scene? Well, the crime is— the result of the crime is dissatisfaction. They were not satisfied. There must have been something that happened. Whatever it was, we need to go find out what that was. But in this sense, once we see what the problem is, immediately now we have to take the next step in the Eightfold Noble Path, and that's right effort. That's the key ingredient that's missing in so many of Western Buddhism's practices, is the right effort. And what is one's right effort is to remove unwholesome thoughts from the mind immediately and substitute them with wholesome thoughts. That this teaching of the Buddha is all over the suttas. There is a sutta that is called— it's number 19 in the Anagami Nikaya, and the name of it is Two Kinds of Thoughts. There are thoughts that are harmful, thoughts that are unwholesome, thoughts that are agitating, and then there are thoughts that are calming, peaceful, and happy. And we are not taught the distinction between those two kinds of thinking as children, because all of the people that we were raised with don't know the difference between wholesome and unwholesome thoughts. And so that's not taught taught in our schools. We're taught how to read, but we're not taught how to think. We're taught how to manipulate computers, but we're never taught how to manipulate our own mind. So here's where we're going with this, is that one's right effort means that we inspect the kind of thought that we have and then change it to a better thought, to a more wholesome thought. This is what's missing in both the Mahayana and the Mahasi method, because they're both looking at investigation. The example that I would use is imagine that you're standing on a highway and a big truck is barreling down on you. Here it comes, maybe even honking his horn. This is my lane, I'm here, get out of my way. There's 3 ways to handle that big truck coming down the road. One is to do it the way that many meditators do, and that is they're trying to force the mind or to stop the mind or to do something with the mind. And that's very much like Popeye the Sailor Man with a can of spinach standing in front of that truck trying to stop it with his fist. And guess what? He gets run over. The other guy is the choiceless awareness. He sees the truck coming, but he lets it hit him anyway. All right, so here's an interesting point about that, and that is, is that if you see the truck and you get all uptight because it's about to hit you, and then it hits you, now you've got two troubles: getting uptight and it hit you. Wouldn't it have been better to not see it at all and just let it run over you? All right, well, this is one of the ways that people practice meditation, is that they're worse off by practicing meditation because they can see the stuff before it hits them, and then it hits them. This is what leads into those higher stages in the 16 stages of insight of misery, fear, disgust, despair, that is often— and also the strong desire to get out of that state, which in Western Buddhism is referred to as the Dark Dark Night of the Soul, a really, really heavy-duty downer.

**Speaker B:** Yes,

**Speaker A:** well, guess what? The Buddha's teaching is known to be good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end when it's taught correctly with the right phrases and meanings. So where does this Dark Night of the Soul for the middle ray, or the, uh, the middle practitioner. He starts off, he learns the meditation, and then things get worse. Something's not fitting correctly here. And this— and where this is, is because the student's not taking the right effort once he sees the Dukkha to throw it out right now, to get rid of it right this very instant, and then come to practice correctly. Now, in the sutta that is a great exposition on the Eightfold Noble Path, right view and right effort especially are discussed this way, that you have to see and evaluate, is this thought wholesome or not? And if it's unwholesome, to remove it. This is also referred to in the very favorite sutta of the Mahayana method, which is Sutra number 10, the Satipatthana Sutta, where the four foundations of mindfulness are laid out: body, feeling, mind, mind's objects. But in the mind's objects part of that sutta, it very specifically spells out the hindrances as something to be removed. That in fact in this sutta it has several things in that last part, the Dhamma, Nibbana section. First is the hindrances are to be removed, and then we look at the Five Aggregates, the Seven Factors of Enlightenment, and the Four Noble Truths in the sense of this is what we should be paying attention to, something that's wholesome, but we have to remove the unwholesome first. And this is something that's missing in the Western Buddhism about these hindrances. They know that they're near and they know that they need to be removed, but they're not looking for them to remove them when they come up. They just have the idea that, oh, someday I should remove the hindrances, or if one hindrance comes up that's big enough that I can see it easily, then I'll remove it. But really what we're talking about is an investigation or a search that we're actually intending to find these hindrances so that we can remove them. That's the distinction that's missing. Also, there's many places in these suttas where the hindrances are mentioned, but in one sutta in particular, it talks about Puja's path. And it says in the beginning, right there when it starts off, it says the first thing to do is to clean the mind so that you are free from unwholesome states. And now we begin the practice. The actual practice of Anapanasati, or the actual practice of the Mahasi method of noting— the noting should be done after the mind is clean. Free from hindrances, not while you're doing the hindrances. What we need to do is to note the hindrances only enough to see that this is a hindrance, and then out it goes. Let's not dwell on it. Let's not inspect it. Let's not figure it out. Let's just throw it out. That's the difference in the way that the Buddha actually taught, is that we need to remove these hindrances as soon as they're caught. Rather than played with as a toy. I mean, once you recognize that this is a pile of shit, why rub it all over yourself? Better just to throw it down and wash your hands and be rid of it. So in the Anapanasati Sutta, it takes it one step a little further than that, and that is that the point of gladdening the mind, that not only just to remove the unwholesome thoughts and put in wholesome thoughts, but we want to intentionally brighten the mind, gladden the mind with the kinds of thoughts that we have. That basically what we're saying is, is that you have spent your whole life into talking yourself into feeling bad. Now is the time to talk yourself into feeling good. This is what brightening the mind and gladdening the mind is all about. Let's not dwell on the hindrance. Let's not dwell in the Dukkha. Let's not inspect the stuff. Let's throw it out and get something much more wholesome, much more better. That's the way that we're practicing now, is to start gladdening the mind, having only wholesome thoughts in the mind. So let us look for a bit and do some investigation of what thoughts then are going to be completely wholesome, what kind of thoughts are obviously completely unwholesome, and then what kind of thoughts are there that's in a gray area that we need to do a little bit more work on. Okay, so there are some kind of thoughts that is very pretty easy. In fact, we can go to those by just looking at the precepts: thoughts of harming people, thoughts of taking things, thoughts of belittling other people, thoughts of greed, thoughts of 'I'm not good enough,' thoughts of victimization, thoughts of 'I need help,' 'I need Jesus as a savior,' 'I'm not I'm not good enough by myself. Okay, these are the kinds of thoughts: I need a doctor, I need a lawyer, I need a mommy, I need a God, I need a Jesus, I need, I need, I need, I need, I need. Those are all unwholesome thoughts. A much more wholesome thought then would be, I don't need anything, I'm okay as I am. There's no place to go and nothing to do, and everything is easy. I'm already enlightened, I don't need anything. You see, much of what you will find in Western Buddhism is Westerners coming to Buddhism doing the same thing that they've been doing all along, and that is wanting something that they don't have. And now they come to Buddhism to want something from Buddhism that they don't have. And many of them put some labels on that. Oh, I want to be Srotapanna. Oh, I want to be an Arahant. Oh, I want to have past life experiences. Oh, I want Nibbana. Oh, I want enlightenment. You know, all of this kind of I want, I want, I want, I want, I want. And so they take all of this into the meditation, wanting stuff, sitting there in unsatisfying place because they want something that they don't have. What's much better is to recognize that what you do have is adequate enough. I mean, here you are, you survived up to this point, you must have been doing something right. You lived, you stayed, I mean, you're still breathing. Why don't we congratulate ourselves for at least making it this far? Instead of finding out all the problems that we had along the way, "Oh, I almost didn't make it that time, and I almost didn't make it this time," instead of worrying about what the problems of the past, let's just take a new view of it that never mind even the future, let's just be okay right now. Let's gladden the mind, let's have some wholesome thoughts. Wholesome thoughts would be: everything's okay, everything is fine, no worries, no problems, no place to go, nothing to do, everything is satisfying, everything is all right. We don't have to say everything is perfect because who needs perfection? That's something that doesn't exist. When people want perfection, they're just wanting something they don't have. We're not talking about getting perfection or getting it all. We're talking about getting enough. Just enough, just a little dab of satisfaction will do you. We can also have thoughts about things are not dangerous. You know, we live in a society that is built upon danger and avoidance of danger. This is why people want a gun, is because they feel insecure and unsafe. This is why people want an education— they feel unsure, unsafe, and insecure. This is why the teenage boy wants a car— he wants freedom, he wants transportation, he feels unsafe and insecure under daddy's thumb. He wants his own car. And so this is all issued. Now here's the thing I'm saying, 100,000, 200,000 years ago, we lived in the jungle, and the jungle actually was dangerous. We needed to deal with danger, and sometimes even now, we need to deal with danger. But in fact, the feeling of danger comes out of the self-preservation instinct. It's an instinctual, inbred programming that comes in with our DNA, and that's kept you alive up until today. Your fear. You know, they have phrases like, uh, um, uh, the fool goes where angels fear to tread, right? So that means that if angels are afraid to go there, then they survive. The fool, he feels no fear, he gets dead. So we have to pay attention to the fear, it's actually a useful tool for us. But the big problem is, is that in our society, most of the fear that we have is conceptualized fear, that it's not really a dangerous animal in front of us, it's just something that we imagine, or that we've been told is dangerous. And so we go around with a whole lot a lot of self— uh, excuse me, false positives. We have false positives. There's a fear that we feel fear when there's no reason to feel fear. We're just in the habit of having a thought and then bringing up fear. We think about the bully that beat us up one time, and now we have the feeling of fear the same as we did when the bully beat us up. Okay. But there's no reason for that. That's just ignorance that we wind up feeling the way that we used to feel when we think about something that happened before, where right now there's no danger. I mean, look at the room that you're in right now. There's absolutely no Anagami anywhere. There's no alligators on the floor. There's no crocodiles. You don't have a tarantula on your keyboard. There's no rattlesnakes on your bed, there's no mafia, there's no SWAT team breaking in. Why is it that we go around feeling afraid when in fact there's no dangers? The answer is that that's taught and built into our society, that in fact it's instinctual to feel fear, but we feel so many false fears because the society is making all of these rules and whatnot. So when we're sitting down and practicing meditation, what that actually should be is that we're actually practicing developing the skills of being satisfied, content, and safe. So a wholesome thought would be telling yourself that you're safe right now, everything's okay right now, there's no dangers. Now contrast that to thinking about an email that you've got to write to the boss, or maybe a letter you've got to write, or maybe a bill that you've got to pay. And as soon as you think of that bill, how do you feel? You feel like you got to go do something, right? Right. That's— and the underlying feeling about that is that something will go wrong if I don't pay that bill. Therefore, I choose right now to feel afraid about that bill. It's almost as if I don't feel afraid of that bill, I won't write the bill, I won't pay the bill, and then I'll have to suffer.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like I understand that to extend when it's about like thoughts, but what about when it, uh, the source of the dissatisfaction like seems more physiological?

**Speaker A:** Like, uh, right, but that's going too deep and it's missing your target. Okay, don't go there. Go to this particular moment the unwholesome thought and remove that. If you keep removing the thought over and over again— the analogy is, imagine that you've got sidewalk, regular sidewalk pavement that's got a crack in it, and a weed is growing up in that crack. All right, now if you, um, you can't pull the weed out But you— and also you can't dig it up, because if you dig it up, you'll destroy the sidewalk. You're doing more damage than the weed itself. It'll take the weed years to destroy that sidewalk, and you wanted to get rid of the weed, will destroy the sidewalk to get rid of the weed. They found that out in Vietnam. You have to destroy a village to save it. But there's another way, and that is just when the weed grows big enough to put a leaf up, then all we need to do is to cut that leaf off, just to cut that shoot off. If you keep cutting that shoot off over and over again, then the weed gets no daylight, it gets no sun, it gets no nourishment, and eventually the root of the weed lead will die out. But for quite a while, belief is going to keep coming up, and the only thing you have to do is to whack that lead off as soon as you see it. That's the teaching of the Buddha, the Dukkha. Dukkha, Nirodha— when the dukkha comes up, you cut it out right then, never mind what the root of it was. We will never see the root of it, but we will eventually see that that plant is no longer— that weed is no longer sending up shoots.

**Speaker B:** So it seems like sort of the essential difference is rather than just like noticing the Dukkha when it arises and like examining it, it's like noticing it

**Speaker A:** and then cutting it off right then and there. Yeah, that's the way to do it. Rather than if somebody insults you, instead of mulling over the insult and feeling bad and trying to wiggle your way out of it, the easy thing to say is, 'Ah, he can't touch me, that's nothing,' and just throw it away. It's not important. Yeah, somebody insulted you, so what? You don't have to learn anything from that. You don't have to feel bad. You don't have to fit in with society. You can just ignore it, throw it out, send him some loving-kindness instead if you've got some loving-kindness. But most people won't throw that stuff out, and so any Metta that that they try to do is going to be tinged with their own ill will for the guy who criticized them. But we just throw it out. It's not— it doesn't matter. It's not important. It's no big deal. And even a better thing, because we're leading to this, and that criticism can't touch me. You've heard that song, I think it's by Jay-Z or somebody, you know, you can't touch me.

**Speaker B:** Arahant.

**Speaker A:** All right, so this is the attitude that we're getting up. But this is an important point about attitude, and that is, is that when we're practicing right view, or right viewing, right investigation, along with right Sati and the right effort of taking these unwholesome thoughts one after another and throwing them out, throwing them out, throwing them out over and over and over again, we begin to gain a fourth ingredient, and that is Samma Sanghappa in the Pali, and that is right noble attitude. The right noble attitude is to be above the world, the supramundane, or in the Pali is lokottara, to get above it all. Can't touch me. Or another way, and perhaps an easier and more rudimentary way of understanding it is from the position of, "Aha, I see that," and that leads to, "Aha, I can handle that." So eventually the student gets to the point is no matter how obstructed the mind is, no matter how tough the situation is, I can throw the hindrances out of the mind and deal with this situation with reality with skill and with aloofness. Possibly a very heavy-duty example of that is getting stopped by the police. I mean, here you are tooling down the road and you see in the rearview mirror, in fact all over the car, is the red and blue flashing lights, followed by the sirens. So when that happens, how do you feel? How do you feel?

**Speaker B:** Anxious.

**Speaker A:** Huh?

**Speaker B:** Anxious.

**Speaker A:** All right, so if you feel anxious before the cop even gets to the window, how are you going to feel when he gets— when he's standing here in the window knocking and say, roll your window down with great authority? Gonna freak out a little bit more, huh? That's how people get killed, is because they're afraid of the cops. They act afraid. When they are afraid, the cop picks up on the fear. So he puts his hand on the gun, and then more fear. And so somebody goes to get their papers, and the cop thinks that they're going after a weapon, and then they use them. They're dead because they were afraid. But if you've got the presence of mind, if you can say, I'm going to be able to handle this really well, when the cop comes. Okay, I can see he's stopping me now. I'm— and as I'm pulling over, I'm saying, I can handle this, there's no problems here, everything's going to be all right. And so you get yourself into a good state, and then when you, uh, the police— when you roll down the police, you can say, hi officer, I'm really glad that you guys are out doing your duty tonight. I've heard such good things about you, and I, I want to make sure that you know that, uh, I'm here to help and you. What can I do for you, officer? Now, with that attitude, it's likely you might not even get a ticket. That you're praising him, you don't admit to any wrongdoing. What you admit to is how friendly you are and how joyful you are to see him. No, officer, I didn't know I was doing anything wrong at all. I'm just going down the highway the way that you would expect us to go down the highway, not breaking any laws. But I really am glad to see you, glad to see you guys out. I know that you will make the road safe. Thank you. How many people have that attitude with the cops?

**Speaker B:** Very few.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, in that regard, that means that you're at an advantage because you have some wisdom going here. Only if you can wake up when those lights are flashing. So this is the point about it. This is where the skill comes in, is to recognize the unwholesome thoughts and to throw them out and replace them with wholesome, friendly, happy thoughts. Over and over and over again, we need to do this. Every time that weed comes up, to the surface, we whack it off. We remove that unwholesome thought. This is the real teaching of the Buddha, and it's right there in the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path. But it's the Western's misunderstanding of this that is the reason why people are not gaining the kind of success out of the practice that they could gain. Or that it takes them years to do it rather than just taking a couple of weeks, just practicing intensely for a couple of weeks, and you can clean your mind out.

**Speaker B:** Right, yeah, it's so interesting. Like, even like listening to this, I can sort of feel my mind like wrestling with like the thing that it wants, which is to be free of like physical discomfort. It's like, oh, but I can't. But then, yeah, as you say this, I'm seeing how like there's so many attitudes and like ideas and stories around that that I could start dealing with right now that are muddying the waters of like whatever the actual physiological thing that's arising is.

**Speaker A:** So that's a— that's an example right there of a policeman with his red lights would be body pain. Yeah. Okay, how are we going to handle that body pain? Well, we can do that old poor me, this is killing me, I don't think I'll last the day. Or you can have the attitude, oh, this is nothing, we can take care of this. But we have to investigate it first to see what it is. Most people just feel the pain and then they either go in one direction or the other. Really what we need to do is just to look at it, to investigate it, to find out that this is merely a surface a surface sensation, or is this something deep? And when we understand what is going on, now we can make choices wisely about it. So the first thing is that ordinary pain, you can handle that. You've been handling pain your whole life and you survived. You can handle this next little pain. It's no big deal. You're a bigger man than that little pain. The pain is only about an inch long. You got a strong mind. I can handle that. You see, that's a different kind of mentality rather than, oh, poor me, how I can get rid of this pain. Oh, the pain is bigger than I am. Oh, I need help to get out of this pain. And that's the loser's attitude. That's a victim's attitude. The winner's attitude of can't touch me. Yeah, that pain is there, but it's okay, I can handle it. We got this far, I can look at that pain the way that it really is. And in fact, Goenka teaches it in the realm of that it's not really a pain at all, it's merely a sensation we don't like. And the intensity of the pain is more the intensity of the not liking it, that the suffering or the Dukkha or the dissatisfaction is because we're calling it pain because we don't like it. When merely it's nothing but a sensation. But normally there's many kinds of pains and sensations that we have would be like a mosquito bite, but we don't even know about the mosquito bite, but we do subconsciously, and so we will scratch that mosquito bite without actually investigating and inspecting But a much better way of handling that mosquito bite is by looking at it, inspecting it, see what it is, and then nourish it with some medication. You take the balm and you put it on and you rub it gently. Everything's going to be okay. This mosquito bite is nothing, as opposed to the ripping of the skin with the fingernails. I don't like this mosquito It's painful, and then by the fingers we're actually opening the skin, exposing it to bacteria as well as the poison that the mosquito put in there. That can get infected if we're scratching it, get a big welt once. But in fact, if it's just a regular mosquito bite that we've put some Tiger Balm or Nourished or do something with it, it's not nothing. Then in fact, I could go so far as to say that I know about Arhat who have left Thailand because they don't like the mosquitoes. Well, why is it that all of the people of Thailand don't leave Thailand because of the mosquitoes? The answer is someplace along the line we learned to deal with mosquitoes happily. We know they're there, and so we like mosquito coils in the evening time because we know they're there. We're paying attention to what's going on.

**Speaker B:** So even when the habit is like very ingrained to like, just, yeah, to hate it or to be angry, like, still the solution is just to start that investigation.

**Speaker A:** Ah, so that means that mosquitoes become our teachers. Yeah. Yeah, the mosquitoes become our teachers because just like that cop can become our teacher— oh, I can handle this cop, I don't have to scratch him because I don't like him. So that's the way to begin to understand this, is that we need to change the content of the mind immediately, right? As soon as we wake up and as soon as we see what's what's going on and change the mind from the unwholesome back into the wholesome, to begin to gladden the mind, to have wholesome thoughts. The wholesome thought: I can take care of this, I'm bigger than this, there's really nothing to be done, I'm fine already, everything is okay, everything is fine, no worries made, nothing to do, no place to go, and everything's going to be All right.

**Speaker B:** So what is it like? Sometimes, like, I feel like I've tried that where it's like, oh, I'm fine, like, there's no problem, I can handle this sensation, and I tell myself that, and it's fine for a moment.

**Speaker A:** One time. Yeah, but then one time.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right. So it's just continuing to do that even.

**Speaker A:** Right, exactly. That's the whole point, is over and over again. You can't whack that weed off and then the next time it grows back you have you then say, shit, I told you one time, I destroyed you one time, and here you are again. Oh, poor me. No, we just whack it off again and whack it off again and whack it off again. This is the repetitive quality of it, that we begin to develop the habit of being able to happily whack off the unwholesome rather than dwelling on it.

**Speaker B:** Sneaky. It's so easy to like make a story or a generalization like, oh, I thought it was fine and it wasn't, so now I believe that I can't do it rather than that I just need to keep at it.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. So you've actually talked yourself into it's not fine when in fact the words you were using is that it's fine. All right, so that's another layer that we look at, that in fact everything really is okay, that we have to actually practice satisfaction. Okay, so we have to find a little bit of satisfaction and then practice that. When I would tell the students to practice it in joy, they would say, "Well, I do have joy, but it's not enough," or, "I tell myself to be joyful, but I don't feel it." Okay, these are both hindrances in the sense that What we're looking for is gladdening the mind to the point that we do feel satisfied. We have to actually generate that satisfaction. We have to generate it with the feeling of safety. Everything right now is safe. I don't have to go anyplace right now. I can just sit here and work this out. All right, and so we have to be safe. We also have to be comfortable. One of the things that I see in Western Buddhism is is they get all competitive and everything, because the idea is that once you relax and you have no place to go, you can just sit there with no place to go and nothing to do, and everything is cool. And the Westerner comes in and sees the guy does that, he says, competition time, I can sit just as long as you can. And now the meditator is sitting there in discomfort, and he wants out of it, he wants to go away, he doesn't want to sit there in pain. He wants to get rid of the pain. Well, what he's doing now is he's practicing wrong. He's actually creating the discomfort rather than finding ways to get out of discomfort. That if you can't sit for long periods of time, then sit for short periods of time and be happy. It's better to have two 5-minute happy sessions than 10 minutes of misery. And so long sitting practices, sitting times of an hour or so, that's a hindrance for most Westerners. So it's much better to practice correctly for shorter periods of time, so long as we're maintaining being comfortable. To maintain— because you're— if you are uncomfortable, that itself is unsatisfactory. But being comfortable, that would be an element of being satisfied. So remaining comfortable, remaining safe, secure, content, comfortable will bring on a state of satisfaction. Everything is okay now, everything is fine, not a problem in the world. Now as we practice that over and over and over again, that satisfaction begins to grow, and it grows into this Samma Sanghappa, the right attitude of, wow, I can do this, this stuff is good stuff and I can do it. Yeah, gaining confidence. So the Pali word is Shraddha, which is not— is translated wrongly as faith. There's no faith in this at all. This is all investigation, experimentation, and building upon one success after another.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm getting a lot to play with out of this because I feel like the mind has sort of started to move in that direction, like just from sort of the process of like getting tired of like a subject. But this seems like a much more proactive way of like, oh no, I can actually practice that. I don't have to wait to like get bored.

**Speaker A:** Anicca. Is it that funny? The way that the Western mind is, is that that they say all things are bad now, but if things get really bad, then I'll learn something. In other words, this is the whole concept of hitting rock bottom. This is what that dark night of the soul is, is for the meditation student to have to hit rock bottom before he actually starts practicing correctly, where the right way to do it is start practicing correctly right from the very beginning when your Dukkha is still small. Get rid of it when it's small rather than having it overwhelming before you can deal with it. One little leaf at a time. You don't have to let that weed grow to entire jungle. Just one little leaf comes up, this thought, and then whack it off, and we're okay. One thought at a time is unwholesome is removed. So there's more to it than this, but I think that this is a good time to relax, to stop, and to collect things, and that we can continue on with this. There's a lot of stories and a lot of ways of looking at it, but basically the entire teaching of the Buddha is wrapped up in these Four Noble Truths, in this Eightfold Noble Path. Of right view, right Sati, right effort, and right attitude. These things, those four together, bring about Arya Samma— Samma Arya Samatha. Now, this word Samatha is always in English translated into concentration, the word concentration, and by doing so we miss the point. Arahant. This is another major, major issue within Western Buddhism and the English language version is that they misunderstand the word Samatha. Because the word Samatha actually means gathering together the appropriate factors. And this Samatha actually is ancient teaching of System Theory. Have you ever heard of General Systems Theory? General Systems Theory has a lot of bits and pieces. It's actually scientific, that's why they call it a theory. General Systems Theory has various postulates. The one that we're looking at is the issue that a system is— the whole is greater than the sum of the parts in a system. Okay, that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. So an example of that would be you could have the car parts spread all over your yard, sure, and you've got no car there. You've just got car parts. It's only when the car parts come together in the appropriate fashion so they become a system, and then something new is added. What is that? Transportation. The car parts alone have no transportation. It's only when they're integral together that there's transportation. Another example of that would be a grandfather clock, that a grandfather clock, when it is put together with the gears in the right places, all the right teeth, all of the dust, and everything is oiled correctly and all of that, then the result of that is the clock ticks and talks in a way that we, with the hand movement, we say we can tell time, right? But if you want to concentrate that clock, you're going to take a sledgehammer to it, and now you've got the clock very small, but it doesn't function anymore. Okay, this is how Western meditation operates. They think that their need to concentrate the mind, and in fact what we need to do is to lubricate and clean the mind and let it operate correctly, rather than concentrating it. So, that whole idea then of Arya Samatha, Samma Arya Samatha, is that the mind becomes fit for work, it becomes organized, it's got all of the constituent components that it needs, that's from—right view, right Sati, right effort, and right attitude—we bring those together and we have an organized mind. That mind is organized and unified because it doesn't want anything. If it wants something, then it's not whole yet. But if it doesn't want anything, then it's whole. Also, if we lie, that means that we're we're separating ourselves from the truth. There's a crowd in there again. Also, if you have an internal dialogue, you ought to do this, oh, I don't want to do that, oh, you should do this, no, I don't want to do that, then that's another crowd inside. If we have doubts, that's also a crowd inside. Is it this? Is it that? But when the mind is unified and whole, we don't want anything, we have no doubts. We have no longing. Everything is already okay. If everything is already okay and we don't want anything, now this is the rest of the path, which is actually not supports and requisites but features. And the features of the path is that if I don't want anything, then I'm not going to kill anybody or harm anybody to get it. If I don't I don't want anything, I'm not going to steal it. If I don't want anything, I'm not going to molest a man's wife. I don't want anything, I'm not going to be jawboning and maligning or complaining or telling lies or harsh gossip or frivolous talk because I don't want anything. So the precepts that we teach our children, up being in fruition only when the mind is fit. But we keep telling the students, oh, you've got to have perfect Sila before you can get your mind together. You'll never get the Sila together until the mind is together, because the mind is the source of the wrongdoing in the first place.

**Speaker B:** Can I ask one more question about right effort?

**Speaker A:** This is right effort, exactly. And the right effort is is to remove the unwholesome thought from the mind right now before you ever have a chance of acting on it.

**Speaker B:** So, so can I ask one more question about that? What about like, like, I start to get hungry, and so some like craving arises, I start to think about like all the different foods that I want to eat. So I stop and say like, okay, like, everything's fine. I don't like, I don't need anything. There's not a problem. But eventually, you know, I still do need to eat. So So how do I balance like the necessity of actually acting on that without like giving in to the proliferation of desires?

**Speaker A:** Well, you already have a routine around eating. All right, so you can follow that routine happily. The question that you ask is actually making problems that don't actually exist. That if you have a thought of food, you can say, well, I'm okay right now, I'll survive for the next hour or two, I'm okay. And if you have actually hungry feelings or hungry pain, the kind of thought that you can have is that, well, I can handle that, that's just a little bit of hunger. I mean, I just ate yesterday, I'm not on the brink of starvation. And so we begin to take a higher level perspective. You're okay right now, even though you're not eating. You'll eat later. Everything will be all right. Enjoy your food when you get it. You don't have to think about it now, wanting it, wanting something that you don't have. If you're sitting there in the meditation hall wanting to eat lunch, you're not meditating. You're wasting your time. You're in suffering. Wait, wait to eat to eat when the food is ready, when the time is right. This is actually a major teaching for the monks, of learning to eat once a day, and to eat twice a day. But we don't need to eat 3 or 4 times a day, and we don't need to snack. That's just something that's part of our culture. In fact, big business wants to eat. They want you to snack. They want you to satisfy your hunger by buying their products and making the guy who is hungry for money richer. Guess what? The more money he has does not make him feel better. No matter how much money Kellogg has, he wants more. No matter how much money Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk have, they want more. So that's the way of food and hunger, is that we always want and want and want. Now is the time to practice. I'm satisfied even though the belly has hunger in it, even though there is a sensation there. I don't have to hate that sensation. I can inspect it, I can investigate it, I can recognize it. In fact, the feeling of hunger is the same kind of situation is that now the body has to draw this nourishment out of the stored energy. In other words, we are no longer charging the battery, now the battery is discharging. Well, that's a normal function. It's a normal function for people to go around being hungry. It's actually a good thing. Food tastes better if you've been hungry for a while. And so when you begin to see hunger is a friend rather than an enemy to get rid of, now we can be okay. I'm all right. Yeah, so I'm hungry. So what? I'm bigger than that hunger. I can handle that. I can wait until lunchtime. No big deal here. So these are the wholesome thoughts as opposed to unwholesome thoughts. Oh, poor me, I'm so I'm hungry and I gotta wait for another hour, and let me think about what to— and they won't even serve me the kinds of stuff that I want. I want a hamburger. I want to leave this meditation retreat and go to McDonald's. Yeah, these are the kind of thoughts that we have, and all of those are unwholesome. And the whole point about sitting down for meditation is beginning to see the mind works like this so that you can begin to control it. That literally everything about the teachings of the Buddha has to do with control. That you learn to control the breathing with long, deep in-breaths. You can learn to control the mind by putting what kind of thoughts that you want in there. You learn to control the attitude by fostering the right attitude. But the Mahasi Method is more a passive practice, to just sit there and watch. You watch the breath. No, we don't watch the breath, we learn to control the breath. If we can control the breath by controlling the mind, then that gives us the possibility and the tools and skills we need to learn to control how we feel. Because mostly our feelings are out of control. For instance, when hunger comes, we don't like it. We can learn to control the way that we feel, and the way that we do that is by talking ourselves into feeling the way that we want to feel. Here's a question for you: if you could choose to feel the way that you wanted to feel, how would you feel?

**Speaker B:** Good, happy, joyful.

**Speaker A:** All right, so start doing that. Start practicing feeling the way that you want to feel.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you've definitely given me a lot to explore and a lot to play with here.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. Well, this is a good ending point now of finishing this off. I think you've got a new focus or a new way of practicing, that instead of noting Dukkha and then noting more Dukkha, we note the Dukkha— out you go, bye. The Buddha had a phrase for this, and that phrase was, aha, I see you, Mara.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Aha, I see that thought.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, I think almost the most important thing is like there's ways in which that sort of become habit automatically just from the wearing out of it, but I feel like what I've taken from this is that like now I can like just notice it in all areas and then be more proactive about finding what's the new script, you know, instead of Just accepting it until the new habit pops up spontaneously.

**Speaker A:** That's really great, Andrew. I'm really glad to meet you. When are you going to call again?

**Speaker B:** Um, oh, I don't know. Uh, when do you have a suggestion?

**Speaker A:** Well, I would suggest, uh, twice a week to once a week in that time period. Not every day and not every in 2 or 3 months, but call often because this stuff has to be repeated over and over and over again. The teaching of the Buddha is small, but it is long-lasting in the sense of we keep doing the same thing over and over again. I use music as an example of that, and I often use Beethoven's Fifth Symphony because actually the entire first movement of Beethoven's 5th Symphony is only 4 notes. It's only 4 notes long. But they repeat it over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. Maybe a whole symphony comes out of just those 4 notes. Okay, so that's the whole point. All right, so the Buddhist teaching is that way too. Dukkha, dukkha, Nirodha, dukkha, dukkha, Nirodha, dukkha, dukkha, Nirodha. Every time that dukkha comes up, we swat it down. Repetition over and over and over again. Yeah, and eventually it weakens, but it doesn't weaken in the beginning. It gets stronger, in fact, that we have to keep vigilant to keep throwing the stuff out rather than getting discouraged. Because the discouragement is just another unwholesome thought. Oh, poor me. Oh, I'm a victim of my own bad habits. Rather than, hey, I can handle that, I could come out of that. Now, this is not an affirmation, this is a reality. Affirmations are trying to get something that you don't have. What we're doing actually to hear is recognizing what's real. This is a reality-based thing. The reality is that you can handle hunger. You've been doing it for your whole life, so why do you make yourself miserable while you are handling it? You can be happy while you're handling it. Yeah. Well, good, Andrew. We'll see you in the next several days then. Sounds good. You have any questions before we go?

**Speaker B:** No, I think— yeah, I think I've got plenty to investigate here.

**Speaker A:** Excellent, excellent. Well, we'll see you soon. Thank you.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a participant named Andrew (Speaker B), is a critique of common approaches in Western Buddhism and a return to what the speaker presents as the Buddha's core, practical teaching. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Thesis: The Buddha's Teaching is Simple & Direct**
The central message is that the Buddha's entire teaching can be distilled to **"Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha"** (Dissatisfaction, its cause, its cessation). This is unpacked as **"Don't worry, be happy."** The speaker argues that Western Buddhism has over-complicated this simple path.

### **Critique of Common Western Buddhist Approaches**
1.  **Over-Complication:** Western Buddhism is likened to a jigsaw puzzle with missing pieces, burdened by lists (3 of this, 5 of that, 16 stages) that obscure the simple core.
2.  **Misplaced Focus on Dukkha:** Methods like Mahayana's deep inspection of suffering or "choiceless awareness" are criticized for dwelling on *dukkha* instead of moving swiftly to its cessation (*nirodha*). This can lead to unnecessary struggle, akin to the "Dark Night of the Soul."
3.  **Passive Observation:** Practices that merely "note" or "watch" sensations, thoughts, and hindrances (like some Mahasi-style noting) are seen as incomplete. They lack the crucial, proactive component of **Right Effort**.
4.  **Bad Translations:** Key misunderstandings stem from poor translations, especially translating *dukkha* as "suffering" instead of "dissatisfaction," and *samadhi* as "concentration" instead of a unified, fit, and organized mind.

### **The Corrected Path: The Proactive Eightfold Path**
The talk presents a specific, active interpretation of the Buddha's path:

1.  **Right View/Investigation:** Not a fixed belief, but an active **investigation** of your present experience—like Sherlock Holmes examining a crime scene. The "crime" is your own dissatisfaction.
2.  **Right Mindfulness:** Remembering to come back and do this investigation.
3.  **Right Effort (The Key Ingredient):** This is the heart of the practice. Upon investigation, you must **immediately remove unwholesome thoughts and replace them with wholesome ones**. This is not passive observation; it's active mental hygiene.
    *   **Unwholesome:** Thoughts of greed, ill-will, fear, "I need," victimhood, wanting enlightenment, comparing, etc.
    *   **Wholesome:** Thoughts of safety, contentment, "I'm okay," "I can handle this," "Everything is fine right now."
4.  **Right Attitude/Intention:** Cultivating a confident, "supramundane" attitude of "I can handle this" or "Can't touch me." This is developed through the successful, repeated application of Right Effort.

### **Practical Instructions & Analogies**
*   **The Weed Analogy:** Unwholesome thoughts are like weeds. Don't dig up the entire root system (over-analyze past trauma). Simply **cut off the leaf (the thought) every single time it appears**. With consistent cutting, the root (the habit) dies.
*   **The Truck Analogy:** Facing a problem (a truck barreling toward you):
    *   **Wrong Effort (Force):** Like Popeye trying to stop it—you get run over.
    *   **Passive Awareness:** Seeing it and letting it hit you—you still get hurt.
    *   **Right Effort:** See it, then **get out of the way** (remove the unwholesome state) and move to a safe, wholesome state.
*   **Start Small & Be Happy:** Practice in short, successful sessions where you maintain comfort and satisfaction. It's better to have two 5-minute happy sessions than one 10-minute miserable one.
*   **Apply to Everything:** Use this method for mental distress, physical pain (re-frame it as a mere sensation), hunger, fear, or even being pulled over by a police officer. Investigate, then apply the wholesome thought: "I'm safe, I can handle this skillfully."

### **Conclusion: A Practice of Active Happiness**
The goal is not to attain some future enlightenment but to **"gladden the mind" and cultivate satisfaction here and now**. The path is one of **gaining control**—not by suppression, but by skillfully choosing wholesome thoughts over unwholesome ones through relentless, friendly repetition. The entire teaching is the simple, repeated rhythm: see dissatisfaction, cease it, see it, cease it.

**In essence:** The talk advocates shifting from a Buddhism of **passive observation and complex stages** to one of **active, moment-to-moment mental management** based on the simple, proactive core of the Eightfold Path.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on your transcript, the speaker uses a rich tapestry of metaphors and stories to critique "Western Buddhism" and explain his interpretation of the core Buddhist teachings. Here is a breakdown of the primary ones:

### **Core Structural Metaphors**

1.  **The Jigsaw Puzzle:** The Buddha's teachings are a complete puzzle. Western Buddhism is the same puzzle with a few key pieces missing, leading to an incomplete understanding.
2.  **The Car (Tesla) & Transportation:** The Buddha's teaching is like a car. Its ultimate purpose is simple: **transportation** (out of dissatisfaction into satisfaction). While later models (traditions) may add complexity (thousands of parts), the core function remains singular and simple. The complexity isn't in the teaching, but in the mind it's meant to "unpack."
3.  **The Marble vs. The Boulder:** The true Dhamma is a **marble**—small, simple, and easy to carry/manage. Western expectations, shaped by religions like Christianity, turn it into a **boulder**—big, heavy, grandiose, and cumbersome.
4.  **The Weed in the Sidewalk Crack:** Unwholesome thoughts (greed, ill will) are like a deep-rooted weed. You can't dig it out without destroying the sidewalk (the mind). The method is to **cut off each shoot (thought) as it appears**. With no sunlight/nourishment (attention), the root eventually dies. This illustrates the repetitive, immediate application of "right effort."
5.  **Beethoven's Fifth Symphony:** The practice is repetitive like a famous musical motif. Just four notes (Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha) are played over and over to create the entire symphony of the path.

### **Stories & Analogies for Practice**

6.  **Sherlock Holmes vs. Dr. Watson:** Meditative investigation (**right view**) is like **Sherlock Holmes** meticulously examining the evidence at a crime scene (the mind). In contrast, intellectual musing or speculation is like **Dr. Watson**—missing the actual clues by getting lost in stories and possibilities.
7.  **The Oncoming Truck (Three Responses):** This story critiques common meditation approaches to mental phenomena (like a disturbing thought):
    *   **The Popeye Method (Forcing/Stopping):** Like Popeye trying to stop a truck with his fist—you get run over. (Trying to suppress thoughts).
    *   **The Choiceless Awareness Method:** Seeing the truck but letting it hit you anyway, resulting in *two* pains: the anticipation *and* the impact. (Just noting suffering without removing it).
    *   **The Implied "Right Effort" Method:** Get out of the way! See the truck (unwholesome thought) and actively move to avoid it (remove/replace the thought).
8.  **The Cop Pulling You Over:** A high-stakes example of applying the "right attitude" (**Samma Saṅkappa**). The habitual, fearful response ("anxious") creates danger. The trained response is to generate wholesome thoughts of safety, respect, and calm ("I can handle this... glad to see you, officer"), which changes the outcome. This applies to any "threat," like physical pain.
9.  **The Baggage on a Trip:** When we go into meditation/seclusion to "get away from it all," we bring our mental baggage (habits, worries) with us. The work is to unpack that baggage here and now.
10. **The Preacher Man vs. The Happy Buddhist Teacher:** A contrast to highlight the simplicity and self-sufficiency of the Dhamma. The preacher is in a "hell" of wanting money. The true Buddhist teacher, already happy, doesn't need to profit from the teaching.

### **Metaphors for Misunderstanding & Critique**

11. **Rabbit Holes:** Speculative questions and answers (like much religious dogma) are "rabbit holes" we go down, often because the entrance was **falsely labeled by bad translation** (e.g., translating *Dukkha* as "suffering" instead of "dissatisfaction").
12. **The "Pony" in the Suttas (Pragmatic Buddhism):** The search through ancient texts is like the joke about the optimistic child who, upon receiving a pile of manure, insists, "There's got to be a pony in here somewhere!" The speaker argues the "pony" (the effective method) has been known in Asia but is lost in Western transmission.
13. **Destroying the Village to Save It (Vietnam Reference):** A critique of over-analysis. Digging out the "root" of every weed (thought) destroys the mind. It's better to just cut the shoots repeatedly.
14. **Concentrating a Grandfather Clock:** A critique of translating *samādhi* as "concentration." You don't improve a clock by concentrating it (smashing it with a sledgehammer). You make it fit for work by **organizing and lubricating** its parts. The mind should be a **unified system**, not a forced, compressed lump.
15. **Hitting Rock Bottom / The Dark Night of the Soul:** Framed as an unnecessary Western tendency. The idea that you must suffer immensely (hit rock bottom) before progress is wrong. The true path is to deal with **small dissatisfactions** as they arise, not let them grow into a jungle.

### **Key Repeated Phrases as Conceptual Metaphors**

*   **"Don't Worry, Be Happy":** Presented as a modern, simple encapsulation of **Dukkha and Nirodha**.
*   **"Can't touch me":** The essence of the **supramundane (lokuttara) attitude**—developing an inner freedom where worldly irritants don't cause disturbance.
*   **"Aha, I see you, Māra":** The quintessential moment of **investigation and recognition**, followed by dismissal, not engagement.

**Summary:** The speaker uses metaphors of **simplicity vs. complexity** (puzzle, marble, car), **active gardening** (the weed), **skillful investigation** (Sherlock Holmes), and **immediate action** (the truck, the cop) to argue for a proactive, thought-based practice centered on the Eightfold Path. He uses stories of **misapplication** (Popeye, the destroyed village) to critique passive or forceful meditation styles common in the West.
