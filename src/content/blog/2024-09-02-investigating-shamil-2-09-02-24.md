### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So, Sean, you have a question about investigation, and you specifically about the body. But before we start with the body, let's cover the issue about the Satipatthana, that when we talk about investigation, we talk about all four all four of the Satipatthana. Uh, the word patthana actually means the footing or the foundations. Okay, so you can say then that everything about you, all of the stuff that supports you— no self, self, everything— is the body, the feelings, the mind, and the and the mental objects that you have. All of these need to be investigated. The Buddha most specifically spends a lot of time on investigating the state of mind that we're in, as well as the thoughts that we have. In fact, the thoughts that we have will give a good point about what state of mind we're in. Now, one point is that when we talk about gladdening the mind, it often means that we're replacing unwholesome thoughts with wholesome thoughts. And the common thing that happens is that as soon as we have a wholesome thought, we have another unwholesome thought that disagrees with that. An example of that would be, everything is all right, and then the thought will be, no, everything is not all right. All right, I'm okay. Well, you're not okay. Joy. Let me have joy. And then the next thought will be, "This is not enough joy." And so, beginning to watch those kind of follow-on thoughts are actually pointers as to what kind of mind state that you're in, so that we can begin to also change the mind state. So that we can actually believe the truth. The reality is that everything is okay. But often when we give ourselves that wholesome thought, everything is all right, everything is fine, our mental state will then bring up an unwholesome thought, is that, yeah, but I can think a whole lot of stuff that's not okay.

**Speaker B:** That happened when I fell down the stairs this morning. I was like, everything's fine, and I was like, oh, my foot hurts so bad. Oh.

**Speaker A:** In other words, we disagree with the wholesome because of our habits, and our habit is basically the mind state that we're in. And so the mental state that we're in contributes then to the thoughts that we have, and we're often not even aware of these unwholesome thoughts because they happen so fast. But if we can watch closely to recognize that often we're disagreeing with the wholesome thoughts that we're practicing. When we practice to gladden the mind, when we practice to change the unwholesome thought into a wholesome thought, then the next thought will be, it's not wholesome enough, I don't believe it, because the mental state hasn't been yet changed. And so the way to handle that is to say, aha, I see you Yet another unwholesome thought coming up, and also I'm beginning to get a load of my actual mental condition, my mental state, so that that can also be changed, so that you can come back with everything really is okay. But this just joy is good enough joy, that this satisfaction is good enough. And so we need to repeat that over and over again, especially since they're going to be interfered with, unwholesome thoughts, as they occur.

**Speaker B:** Can you define the mental states, or is that not necessary?

**Speaker A:** You just— all right, the two primary mental states is winner and loser. The two primary states is victim and boss. All right, are you going to be the boss of your life, or are you going to be a victim to life? We are raised to be a victim. We were born as a victim. We were born helpless, and Mommy and Daddy did all they could to stay in charge which meant that they wanted to keep you a victim. Sometimes even when a 40-year-old man lives with his mother, his mother will still boss him around and make him a victim. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** I've seen that happen a lot.

**Speaker A:** So our moms and our dads want us to stay under their thumb. Why? Because they're still under some thumb. Themselves. And we become under the thumb of, or victim to, society, cops, governments, politicians, salaries, bosses, all kinds of things that we remain victim to. But the number one thing that we stay victim to is all of the thoughts that we have. That keep us as a victim. We victimize ourselves. And that part of becoming a winner is to take responsibility for this, saying, "I can do this, I can feel good, I can be okay, I can be satisfied even when I have unwholesome thoughts from time to time, I can change them." So we begin to change our attitude.

**Speaker B:** Something I've started picking up during practice is when I say like, this unwholesome thought will not make me feel bad for long, or like something like that, like, this will not keep me down for long, and it helps me a lot to get back on track.

**Speaker A:** Well, if you can say, aha, I see you, unwholesome thought, you're no longer under its control.

**Speaker B:** I started doing that, but like, I'll do like, I like, I like do the hand motion of grabbing a snake by the head outside.

**Speaker A:** I'm sorry, what? I'm— it's hard to hear you. I hear a little echo. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Like sometimes when I'm outside and I see something and I like, I'm like, Arahant, I see you. I'll do like this, like motion, like without realizing, like grabbing the snake by the head. Is the microphone busted?

**Speaker A:** Oh, uh, hello? Oh, I see what's going on. All right, let me close this off. All right, that'll help. I wish there was a little bit of an echo, so now try it.

**Speaker B:** Did that fix it? Oh, it's still kind of bad.

**Speaker A:** I'm listening.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I was saying I've started sort of like having a hand grasp motion whenever I catch it on wholesome thought. It's like a reflex.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it's an absolute reflex. Why? Because the habit is there on automatic pilot, and that we have to kind of rewire the circuitry over and over and over again. Basically, what's really happening at scientific level is that we're creating new neurons and neurological pathways and letting the old neurological pathways become unused. So that we don't go down that path anymore. But this takes practice, often constant practice. One way that I say it is, is that when people sit for meditation for 1 hour a day, that whole hour they're not having wholesome thoughts. They have hindrances, and then for the next 23 hours, they're in solid hindrances and unwholesome thoughts. On top of that, they have been in the habit of having unwholesome thoughts for more than 20 years if they're over 20. So the odds are stacked against you in your own mind. But with changing our attitude of, never mind it's against me, I can do this. All right, so now we can start. If you can understand that much The odds are against us, but we can practice over and over and over again. We can practice having wholesome thoughts. We can practice building the skill of mindfulness so that we can— or actually, the better way is to go back to the Pali word of Sati, which means that we can remember to look. If we can remember to look, then we can see it and make a change to it. And by doing so, we can change those neurological pathways. So, here's the reason for watching the breath, is because every long in-breath that you take, Sati takes remembrance, and every long out-breath takes Sati, it takes to remember that this is going to be a long out-breath. And so one of the easy ways to develop Sati is by using the breath. I breathe in long, I breathe out long. I breathe in long, I breathe out long. It's not just the body, it's the combination of the body and the mind. If the mind can say, "Breathe out long and breathe in long," then the mind, is controlling the body, training the mind, and training the body. And so, the investigation that needs to be done is the investigation of the body and the mind. And so, as we learn to watch our breath, breathing in long and breathing out long, We can also begin to see, as we're doing that, that the body is making some intentional changes. For instance, you begin to feel the cloth of the shirt as the body's breathing. The lungs come up, the lungs go down. You can feel it in the back, you can feel it in the shoulders. If you're deep breathing, you can feel the the touch of the air on the skin, and we can become sensitive to the body. Now, there's two ways of doing that. One is by just sitting still and paying attention to the breathing and watching the body doing its little bit of movements. And then the other one is when we're active, like for instance, you just laid back in the chair. Do you feel the chair now? On your back?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** After you changed it. All right. Now, the more important part of this is to begin to watch what your hands are doing. Putting our hands to our face, holding our hands, touching, reaching, grabbing. For instance, turning a doorknob requires our hand. Picking up objects requires the hand. So, the thing to do is to be mindful, or to remember to look at what your hands are doing. Now, another way of looking at it is that— here's an example: picking up an object, we almost always have our mindset focused on the object. But we're going to begin to change that to focus on the hand as it's holding the object. When we're holding the object, it touches the hand. Where? What are the sensations? This will also help us to remember to slow down our gestures and our hand movements so that we can pay attention to what's happening. Now there is a point to all of this, and the primary point is that in order to feel satisfied, the body needs to be comfortable, even further than that, relaxed. So our breathing in and breathing out is to relax the body. Also that when we're feeling the touch of the cloth and the touch of the air and other things like this, we also begin to get in touch with the feelings and emotions that are expressed in the body. An example of that is anxiety is a bodily function. Being angry is a bodily function. That's why they talk about seeing red and red in the face and rednecks and all of that kind of stuff, is because we actually have physiological changes in the body based upon how our attitude is and how we're feeling. So if the attitude is a victim and I don't like it, then that will give rise to the fact that we become afraid. Say the bully is criticizing us and we don't like that criticism because it's me he's criticizing, and therefore I feel fear. And the fear then is often dealt with by covering it over with anger so that we feel powerful. How dare him call me a nitwit? Where in fact he's not calling you a nitwit, he's just trying to say nitwit to anybody who comes around. Because he doesn't feel good, he wants to feel better, by making himself better than other people. So if we can see it that way, then we can recognize, "Oh, there's no reason for me to feel afraid." But if I do feel afraid, do I feel that fear in the body? Do I feel the tension? Do I feel the frustration? Look at what your hands do when you're frustrated. Look at what your hands do when you're angry.

**Speaker B:** That's actually really cool. I was, I was, um, I was trying to write down a bit of this and I actually started getting a little frustrated. My hands started moving faster.

**Speaker A:** Getting a little frustrated, you start to move faster. Yes, that's a good issue so that you can see then how the body the feelings, and the mind states are all interrelated, and especially how the mind state affects our mind's objects.

**Speaker B:** That's actually really cool.

**Speaker A:** And so this is why we're actually going to be intentionally paying attention to what the body is doing, because that's a good method of way of seeing what's going on is our attitude. Another one is to watch your speech. Look at the kind of words that we use. If we're using words like try or hard or work, then we can see that there is frustration built into that. There is the feeling of not liking it, often the feeling of fear. And if we can then see it by listening to our language, we can say, "Aha, I see you." And now because we can see it, we have an opportunity to change it. If we can't see it, we can't change it.

**Speaker B:** Are the things like "try hard" and "work" relating just to practice or to any life scenario?

**Speaker A:** Well, be careful about using these words. In fact, there is possibly a list of words that you can make for yourself to say, I'm going to take these words out of my vocabulary. Not going to use these words unless I know specifically that I'm using those words. An example of those kind of words then would be words that don't mean anything or mean too many things. Like the word love. And so I tend to not use the word love. I also tend to not use the word meditation because the word meditation is just all over the place. I also tend not to use the word concentration unless I'm describing what we're talking about here, because the Buddha did not talk about concentration. What he talked about instead was unification of the mind, which actually means unifying the body the feelings, the mental states, and our mental objects, so that we're no longer a crowd inside, that we can see these interrelationships. And so there's a lot of words that you can play with as to ones that have a direct indicator as to how you feel.

**Speaker B:** So in the investigation is to find those interrelationships and figure out how you work.

**Speaker A:** Um, a really good example, by the way, of those is expletives. What kind of expletives do you use? Oh my God. Uh-huh. Okay, expletives is putting out. Okay, like hell, or what the hell, or what the fuck. All right, those are expletives. Anagami. Damn it all to hell. My dad, my dad had a few of them. Uh, dang nabbit was his. Gosh darn it, that was an expletive. Yeah. All right, so start looking at the expletives you're using. The one that I generally use the most is wow, because wow is a much more wholesome word than dang nabbit. Damn, or damn it to hell. So all of these expletives— be careful of the expletives that you're using because that's a direct indication of the mental state that you're in.

**Speaker B:** If you fell down the stairs and you hurt your shin, what would be a good expletive? Would wow be a good one?

**Speaker A:** Um, actually, I can't choose the expletives for you What we're not talking about is which expletives to use. It's the fact that you know that you're putting out an expletive, and you know that you don't like falling down the stairs. But the reality is that you survived, that you're okay. You might be a little bit sore here and there, but you'll get over that. There's nothing to it. And next time you'll be more mindful of walking down the stairs so that you don't slip and fall, that you'll be mindful that maybe the children have put some marble or some shoe or something on the stairs and you start watching where you're going.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I have to be more mindful of the cat running down the stairs and tripping me up.

**Speaker A:** Yes, cats like to walk with people and sometimes walk right in so that people will step on their cat or trip over the cat or whatever like that instead of just stopping and seeing what the cat is doing so that they can— but we're in a hurry often. If you're going downstairs, there's a reason to go downstairs. Recognize that often that you're in a hurry to go downstairs, and so is the cat.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I'm in a hurry to do laundry and the cat's in a hurry to follow me.

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm. So recognize that you're in a hurry to do the laundry so that you can slow down.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And you're in a hurry. Why? Because you need something, that things are not right, they're not correct, you got to fix it. If you don't fix it right away, the daddy in your mind is going to yell at you.

**Speaker B:** So inadvertently, the daddy in my mind made me trip and fall down the stairs.

**Speaker A:** Well, there was a whole sequence of events, and you could have stopped at any one of them.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I know. If I say that daddy made me do that, I become the victim.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. Aha, I see you, daddy. Aha, I see I'm in a hurry. Aha, I see that cat. Aha, I I see that I can slow down and not fall down the stairs. And if I do fall down the stairs, never mind, I can pick myself up and slowly go to the grocery store.

**Speaker B:** The laundry still gets done.

**Speaker A:** And so the whole point then, back to the Satipatthana, is to integrate so that the body becomes relaxed. If you can have the body relaxed, have the mind in a state of contentment, where you're feeling satisfied, when there's no hindrances, when you can apply the mind and sustain it on that joy and on that satisfaction, that's the goal of the Buddha. He says that the path to enlightenment in fact is the first Jhana, and I've just described it, where the body is relaxed, The feelings are okay, comfortable, satisfied. The mind state especially is the mind state of a winner. I've got this wired. And then the thoughts that we have are going to be wholesome thoughts because we trained ourselves that way. And so the first Jhana actually requires all of the features of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. To be incongruent. Incongruency, not incongruent, but you are congruent. What does that mean? That means unified. It means together. That means that the body is relaxed, the feelings are contented and satisfied, that the mind state is the state of a winner, and the thoughts are free from hindrances. And so that's it. But it's not a goal, it's a state. What do I mean by it's not a goal? Is because people will fuss at themselves with the daddy in their mind. Oh, you're not where you ought to be, you ought to be, you know, contented and satisfied and all of that. And when we're saying we ought to be that, we're actually fussing at ourselves for not being that. Yes. So that's another word that we can be mindful of, is the word ought, would, should, could, because these are words that are giving you orders.

**Speaker B:** And I think everyone sort of does sometimes just randomly land on being content, but it goes away pretty fast if you don't know how to sustain it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So, we're going to practice being content. We're going to practice relaxing the body, putting it at rest. We're going to practice having the attitude of a winner, feeling successful. The satisfactions over and over again lead to the feeling of being successful. Yeah, so these are all things that need to be investigated so that you can make changes to them.

**Speaker B:** I can do that.

**Speaker A:** Good, that's the right attitude. Exactly. Yeah, do this.

**Speaker B:** I mean, I don't have much else I'd like to discuss. I would like to say thank you for talking to me for the first time, because it was kind of during a point where it was like even hard for me to like go outside and do stuff. And when I started practicing more and more, doing stuff in general just got easier. And I want to continue to do this. And I appreciate everything you've done.

**Speaker A:** My pleasure. Okay, well, let's finish the call now and I'll let you go practice some more.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right. I've noticed that you have signed up, logged into the Open Sangha Foundation website.

**Speaker B:** I'm making YouTube thumbnails with Mikey.

**Speaker A:** I'm sorry, what?

**Speaker B:** I'm helping Mikey make some thumbnails every once in a while.

**Speaker A:** Excellent, excellent. Thank you. Be sure to put your image on. We're looking for photos to make them, uh, rather than default, uh, pinwheels or whatever. It's better to have your photo.

**Speaker B:** I didn't know you could do that. I'm going to do that when I'm— when I get off.

**Speaker A:** When you get on to your, uh, user profile page, click on the photo in the top.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And it'll say change photo, or you might have to pull down the menu on the gear wheel, the settings, to say edit. Oh, I see it.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I see it.

**Speaker A:** And after you say Edit Profile, then you can change your photo. Cool. Excellent.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I need to get a good photo.

**Speaker A:** Well, you can get a good photo right off of this video that'll be finished in a few minutes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, actually I'll do that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you can bring up the YouTube and then do a screenshot of it and then cut it Copy. Takes me about 3 seconds to do that. I've done it so often.

**Speaker B:** Do you make the YouTube thumbnails too?

**Speaker A:** Uh, no, I'm doing more coding and keeping and getting the data going to where the thumbnails are normally for the videos.

**Speaker B:** That's cool.

**Speaker A:** We also could use some help, uh, by, uh using a video editor to make some shorts, to crop a video down, to download it from YouTube and crop it down to about 2 minutes, 1 minute, something. I think it's the YouTube requires a 1 minute, and we've got a number of places that we would like to have a 1 minute short.

**Speaker B:** I think having a couple of shorts would be good. I have some videos that I actually kind of saved that I could go back to and make a few shorts of.

**Speaker A:** Excellent, great. All right, so, uh, videos and, and stuff like that is what, uh, Mikey is doing. So get in touch with him about it. Okay. All right, thank you so much, Sean.

**Speaker B:** All right, have a good one. Yeah, you too. Um, have a good day.

**Speaker A:** All right, you have a good day too.

**Speaker B:** Bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on the provided transcript, here is a summary of the Dhamma talk between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and a Sangha friend, Sean (Speaker B):

**Core Theme:** Practical application of the **Four Foundations of Mindfulness (Satipatthana)** to transform mental habits and achieve a unified, contented state of mind (the first Jhana).

**Key Points:**

1.  **Investigation & The Four Foundations:** True investigation involves all four foundations: body, feelings, mind, and mental objects (thoughts). They are interconnected and support each other.
2.  **The Battle of Thoughts:** A central practice is "gladdening the mind" by replacing unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones (e.g., "Everything is okay"). A key insight is that our habitual mental state often immediately contradicts wholesome thoughts with unwholesome follow-ups ("No, it's not okay"). Noticing this pattern is crucial.
3.  **Fundamental Mental States:** The two primary mind states are **Victim vs. Winner** (or Boss). We are culturally conditioned to be victims—to external authorities and, most importantly, to our own thoughts. The path involves taking responsibility and cultivating the attitude of a "winner": "I can do this, I can feel good, I can change my thoughts."
4.  **Mechanism of Change:** By repeatedly recognizing unwholesome thoughts ("Aha, I see you"), we create new neurological pathways and let old, habitual ones fade. This requires constant practice because old habits are deeply ingrained.
5.  **Role of the Body (Ānāpānasati & Daily Life):** The breath is a primary tool for developing mindfulness (*sati* = remembrance). Consciously breathing long breaths trains the mind and body together.
    *   Investigation extends to daily activities: feeling bodily sensations (cloth, chair, air), and especially **watching the hands**. By focusing on the sensation of the hand touching an object (instead of the object itself), we slow down and see how mental states (frustration, hurry) manifest physically.
6.  **Investigating Speech & Language:** Our words are direct indicators of our mental state. The talk advises monitoring:
    *   **Frustration words:** "try," "hard," "work."
    *   **Vague or overloaded words:** "love," "meditation," "concentration" (preferring "unification of the mind").
    *   **Expletives:** What we exclaim in stress reveals our underlying attitude (e.g., "damn" vs. "wow").
    *   **Ordering words:** "should," "ought," "could" — these often represent an internal "daddy" voice that fosters a victim mindset.
7.  **The Goal: Unified Congruence (First Jhana):** The aim is not a distant goal but a unified state where:
    *   The **body** is relaxed.
    *   The **feelings** are content and satisfied.
    *   The **mind state** is that of a "winner" (confident, responsible).
    *   The **thoughts** are free from hindrances and wholesome.
    This congruent state *is* the first Jhana, the heart of the Buddha's path.
8.  **Practical Advice:** The entire process is a gentle, persistent practice of relaxing the body, cultivating contentment, adopting a winner's attitude, and investigating the interconnections between body, feelings, mind, and thoughts to make skillful changes.

**The Dynamic:** The talk is a practical, friendly dialogue. Dhammarato provides instruction and frameworks, while Sean shares personal experiences (falling down stairs, frustration while note-taking) that immediately illustrate the teachings, making them relatable and grounded.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary speaker (Speaker A) uses several metaphors and stories to illustrate their points about mindfulness, mental habits, and the Satipatthāna (Foundations of Mindfulness). Here is a breakdown:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The "Footing" or "Foundation"**: The Pali word *Satipatthāna* is explained as the "footing" or "foundations" upon which everything about a person is built (body, feelings, mind, mental objects). This construction metaphor frames mindfulness as a stable base for investigation.

2.  **"Under the thumb"**: Used to describe the state of being a victim. The speaker says we are kept "under the thumb" of parents, society, bosses, and ultimately, our own thoughts. This metaphor conveys control, oppression, and lack of autonomy.

3.  **"Rewiring the circuitry" / "Neurological pathways"**: The process of replacing unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones is compared to rewiring neural circuits. Old, habitual pathways (unwholesome thoughts) must be left unused, while new pathways are created through practice. This uses modern neuroscience as a metaphor for mental training.

4.  **"Automatic pilot"**: The habitual, unthinking state in which unwholesome thoughts arise reflexively. This metaphor highlights the lack of conscious awareness in our default mental habits.

5.  **"A crowd inside"**: The opposite of a unified mind. This metaphor describes the internal state of being fragmented, where body, feelings, mind states, and thoughts are not in harmony. The goal is to unify this "crowd."

6.  **"Grabbing the snake by the head"**: Introduced by Speaker B and acknowledged by Speaker A, this is a vivid metaphor for catching and neutralizing an unwholesome thought decisively, preventing it from "biting" (harming) you.

### **Stories & Anecdotal Examples**

1.  **The Disagreeing Thought Sequence**: The speaker gives a relatable story of internal dialogue: when one tries to think "Everything is all right," a follow-up thought immediately argues, "No, it's not." This story illustrates how mental states sabotage wholesome thoughts.

2.  **The 40-Year-Old Man Living with His Mother**: A brief story to exemplify how people can remain in a victim role, even into adulthood, by staying under a parent's controlling "thumb."

3.  **The Bully's Criticism**: A story to explain the interplay of body and mind. A bully's insult triggers a victim mindset ("he's criticizing *me*"), leading to fear, which the body manifests as tension. This fear is often covered by anger to feel powerful. The story teaches how to dissociate the insult from the self and observe the bodily reactions.

4.  **Speaker B's Frustration While Note-Taking**: A real-time, spontaneous story. Speaker B notices that as they become frustrated trying to write, their hands start moving faster. This is used by Speaker A to perfectly illustrate the interrelation of mind state (frustration), mental object (the task), and bodily expression (fast hand movements).

5.  **Falling Down the Stairs (Recounted by Speaker B)**: This personal story is referenced multiple times. Speaker A uses it to teach several lessons:
    *   How unwholesome thoughts ("my foot hurts") disagree with wholesome ones ("everything's fine").
    *   How to choose a mindful response (e.g., "wow") over a reactive expletive.
    *   How the incident resulted from a chain of unmindful events (being in a hurry, not noticing the cat).
    *   How to avoid victimhood ("the daddy in my mind made me trip") by taking responsibility for each step in the sequence.

6.  **The Cat on the Stairs**: An extension of the falling story, this anecdote about the cat tripping someone becomes a lesson in shared intention (both human and cat are "in a hurry") and the need to slow down and observe one's environment and internal rush.

7.  **The Daddy in Your Mind**: A personified story of the internal critic. The speaker suggests that the feeling of being in a hurry to do laundry comes from an internalized "daddy" who will "yell at you" if things aren't fixed immediately. This story helps externalize and observe the source of compulsive behavior.

These metaphors and stories serve to make abstract Buddhist psychological concepts (like *Satipatthāna*, unwholesome/wholesome thoughts, and unification of mind) concrete, relatable, and applicable to everyday life.
