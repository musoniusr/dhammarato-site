### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Well, welcome to the Sunday afternoon Dhamma talk. We're all friends here. Everybody has a say-so. All they have to do is raise their hand on the video. This is a kind of an open conversation. But it is not a lecture. Today we have a couple of questions to be answered. The one that we're going to start with is anxiety. And anxiety actually is one of many people's favorite bad feelings. We have actually favorite bad feelings. Let me take a poll. What's your favorite bad feeling? Anna, what's your favorite bad feeling? Oh, she left. Oh, Jonas left. Okay. So Anna, what's your favorite bad feeling?

**Speaker B:** It is anxiety.

**Speaker A:** Anxiety, huh? Gary, what's your favorite bad feeling?

**Speaker C:** Oh, it's probably going back into the past and finding some situation that I didn't come out of very well and imagining what might have happened if I'd been bigger and stronger and had a big bat to rearrange the other person's face with. In other words, revenge.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, revenge.

**Speaker C:** Except of course it's pointless because it didn't happen. It never will happen. You can't rerun the past. But now the question perhaps that comes from this is, at what point do you stop it? I mean, At what point in the cycle of dependent arising are you when you get that thought and have to stop it?

**Speaker A:** All right. Actually, there has been a video that somebody named Doug had done, and one of our friends, I think Asus, posted it. And in there they're talking about skillful means, and they use an example which we will do some modification on. And the example is that a dad goes into the house to tell the children the house is on fire and they don't listen to him. And so he tells them, oh, there's a golden chariot outside 'Go outside to see what the golden chariot is,' and they all rush out of the house because of the golden chariot. And some will call that skillful means, because it was effective, yet at the same time, it was a lie. He lied to his kids. And the answer correctly would be, that those little kids who he can pick up, pick them up and take them out of the house. The kids that are too big and too old will resist being picked up. You tell them that there's a fire, and they won't listen to you until they recognize that they can't breathe and they're choking, and then they'll remind themselves that Dad told us the house was on fire, and they'll get up and leave on their own. So you can, in fact— this is the way that the Dhamma is taught. That you cannot tell people that you must practice Anapanasati or the boogeyman's going to get you. Nobody's going to believe me if I said that. And yet that's what Christianity is all about. You do what you're told to do in Christianity or you're going to go to hell. And all the kids will believe that and become afraid, but none of the adults believe it. So threatening people just doesn't work. So the answer then to your question, and in fact the answer to Thomas's question, then is the same thing, is when you see that your house is on fire, you'll get up and walk out. When— because I pointed out that your house is on fire. So when you're having thoughts of revenge, when you're having thoughts of anxiety, when you're having thoughts that are favorite thoughts, and you begin to recognize that that's unwholesome, only then can you do something about it. So basically, one of the big points about the teachings of the Buddha is that First Noble Truth: there is Dukkha. Can you see it as Dukkha? Can you see what you're doing as Dukkha? Because if you can't see it as Dukkha, you're not going to change. Now, going back to that story about the house burning down, a lot of people's houses are burning down. Their whole life is on fire and they don't know it. They're asleep to it and they don't recognize it. Because nobody's pointed it out to them. So the noble Dharma then is to point out there is Dukkha. Look out for it. Start paying attention to the fact that many of the kind of thoughts that you have are really not worth having. That in fact, thoughts of revenge are downright unwholesome. Thoughts about the future also is downright unwholesome. Worrying about what's going to happen and planning on and getting 40 different ways of doing it, planning out your spiel, that in fact when you're in the intensity of the moment, you carry that anxiety, you built it up, you carry it into that meeting or whatever, and then you're going to forget all about all of the answers and you're going to be giving them an anxiety-filled answer. So the better thing to do when you're going to a meeting or going to someplace, maybe you're going to have to give a speech or on the pulpit or whatever like that, is to walk up there completely unprepared, completely happy and joyful with the thought that whatever happens, I'll be OK. Now, sometimes that works and sometimes it doesn't. In fact, for me, I'm not sure. But for Donald Trump, for sure it doesn't work, because he's actually in a way really already uptight. He's not prepared, but he's still uptight about it. And so, if you've got anxiety, and you prepare, that preparation is probably not going to do you a bunch much of good because you'll forget about all the good plans that you made. So the better thing to do is beginning to see that right now, while I'm thinking about that meeting, I have anxiety about it. We can say, "Hot dog, right now I can do something about it." If I can take that anxiety away now, and take it away a minute from now, and take it away an hour from now, and keep practicing that way, then when you get into the meeting, you'll go into that meeting relaxed. In fact, as you're walking into the meeting, you'll say, "All right, I see that anxiety building up with every step that I take. Hot dog, I can see it. Let me take a deep breath, maybe 2 or 3 or 4 deep breaths. Let me get some oxygen in the blood. Let's get energized here." And then we can walk into that meeting completely relaxed. This is the way to handle it, but we got to practice in advance. And what you're saying, Thomas, is that you're practicing anxiety so that you'll be really, really good at being really uptight and anxious when you're in that meeting. Is that the right way to go?

**Speaker D:** No, but are you saying, when you said it might not go right, you have to, like you said, it might work or it might not, you have to let go of that clinging to it actually working, right? It's not— So if you go into that meeting unprepared, what you're focusing on is, I'm going to be okay, whether it goes well or it goes badly, but you can't, it's not like it's a surefire way for it to go well. You just have to accept that it may go well and it may not go well. Is that right?

**Speaker A:** Exactly. However, if you're already an expert on the topic, it'll probably go well. And if you're an idiot on the topic, then it probably won't go well. Which means then that there is a certain amount of preparation, prior knowledge. But we're not talking about prior knowledge. We're talking about building up anxiety over something that's going to happen, possibly because we're not prepared for it. So in another way of saying, maybe it would be better to prepare for the meeting rather than be uptight and anxious about the meeting, if you're unprepared. In a way, you could say I've been preparing for the past 40 years for this talk today. Sitting on my butt in the back of a wat, mostly without a book, but sometimes with one, practicing being okay, everything is fine, not a worry in the world. And so you can waltz into any conversation that way, and you'll be all right. You're not going to win every case, that in fact, in the position of the Dharma, the success rate is quite low. The number of nobles that actually, let us say, of all the people who hear the noble Dharma, generally only about 10% will understand it. And then there's another 90% of people who never hear the Dharma, which means that now, we're going to be down to about 1%. In fact, I would say, in a way, our Sangha here has been extremely lucky. I haven't taken any surveys, but I have the feeling that we're much higher in our success rate than 10%. That in fact, the Sangha today is proof of that already. So, Anna, you've got your hand up, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I was thinking that my other favorite bad feeling is nostalgia. But sometimes I feel like I use nostalgia for inspiration, but sometimes also drags me and makes me depressed. So I don't know how to handle those two feelings coming from nostalgia.

**Speaker A:** All right. So the answer to that is the same. When you can have those nostalgia thoughts and everything is beautiful, you're not going to change them. But when you see those nostalgia thoughts as not beneficial, not wholesome, not doing you any good, then you can change them. And once you decide in general that nostalgia thoughts are not wholesome, maybe because the Buddha said so, then you'll be on guard for nostalgia. And when it comes up, you can say, 'Hot dog, I see that.' and then you can do something about it. In fact, I don't know about nostalgia in the sense of that word, but I do know, Gary, that the Buddha specifically talks about thoughts of revenge and thoughts of hurting people. Those delicious thoughts of getting even, getting our retribution, are actually harming us. And he recommends, when you see that you're having thoughts of getting even, then you can say, aha, I see that, and then we can change it. Maybe you can change it into, I bet that guy's already gotten the revenge all by himself without me even having to think about it. He's already stuck up, uptight, more miserable than I am. Haha, I've already gotten my revenge. Been there, done that. Or you can think of it in the other way. Some people call Metta, oh, I bet he's going to be okay. He doesn't need my revenge. In fact, my revenge thoughts don't even have any effect upon him. So whatever he is, he is. But our thoughts of revenge and thoughts of anger and thoughts of getting even and thoughts of harming someone is more likely to harm the guy who's having that thought than it is the guy he's thinking about. Look at your average Trump supporter: they're all angry and uptight, they have lost America, they need to get America back again, they've got to make it great again, they've got to make it white again. And they're going to be unhappy and uptight, because they don't get what they want. And if they'd stop wanting America to be different— I mean, America is stuffed up simply because people want it to be different. If they'd leave it alone, it'd be okay. And so having those thoughts of revenge— boy, we're going to have a law, we're going to pass a new law that does blah blah to XX—.

**Speaker C:** And.

**Speaker A:** We get all uptight with those kind of thoughts, but they like them. They like to have those thoughts of revenge. So, Gary, when you see those thoughts of revenge, can you see them as unwholesome for yourself?

**Speaker E:** Of course.

**Speaker C:** Of course you can. Of course you can. But I mean, if you pursue the thought of revenge, it produces a thrill almost as good as that of Piti.

**Speaker A:** Right, exactly.

**Speaker C:** I mean.

**Speaker A:** That'S your average Trump supporter. They get really excited when one of these young progressive newsmen comes around and asks them questions. So that means then, do you want to build your life's success upon revenge? Or do you want to build it on, let us say, safety, security, comfort, freedom? Because in fact, that's a way of bondage. Those thoughts of anger and frustration, those thoughts of getting revenge, is more of a bondage. They're stuck there. That's the only kind of joy that they can find is the joy of harming other people. And if they act on that and go out and harm people, somebody's going to harm them back.

**Speaker C:** He that liveth by the sword shall he not die by the sword. The biblical thing.

**Speaker A:** Anna, you got your hand up again.

**Speaker B:** Sorry.

**Speaker A:** All right, Jones, Jonas, you got your hand up?

**Speaker F:** Yeah, I was actually wondering about these situations where it actually happened that you hurt someone, because like I was wondering, because it happened to me yesterday. I hurt someone, like a friend of mine, out of my like unwholesomeness, and how to handle these situations.

**Speaker A:** Don't do it. Be mindful in advance. Now that you've done it, now that you've hurt someone, you can be on guard for that. Now that you know that your house is on fire, you can pay attention to when you start to inhale the smoke. Of your own fire. So that's the way to handle it, is do it in advance. In other words, shut your trap before you harm someone. Be careful about what you say, and that takes practice. This is something that we can do. Actually, the whole point of the Buddha's teaching is that you've got to practice in seclusion Because in the heat of the moment, you don't have your act together, because the situation is, let us say, fearful and dangerous for you. And so, Thomas, going back to what you were saying, the way to practice being free from that anxiety about some future event is to practice being okay in advance. Just like a concert pianist is not going to walk out on the stage and sit down and play a concerto perfectly without having practiced. That's the preparation. We've got to be prepared. We've got to practice. And so in this regard, we've got two kinds of practices. One is to be prepared for the meeting by having the correct information that we need, and the other one is to get ourselves emotionally straightened out, getting rid of that anxiety. And so we need to do both of those things. Just like a concert pianist can actually walk out on the stage full of butterflies in his stomach, and he has practiced for years on this particular piece of music, but now that he's afraid of having stage fright, butterflies in the stomach, then he's emotionally not prepared for that performance that he's about to give, and he'll probably screw it up then. So we need both kinds of preparations.

**Speaker D:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] If I can quickly ask, can the preparation involve visualization about that future event, like an athlete, or as you said, a pianist. They may be both practicing their piece, but they may also be, as I guess a pianist visualizing them, you know, out on the stage performing in front of lots of people.

**Speaker A:** Is there a link about having the people clap for him and all of that kind of stuff? Yes, would be kinds of visualization. But mostly what we practice is the kind of stuff of basically using discursive thought, talking to ourselves, gladdening the mind, brightening the mind, so that the concert pianist can actually have a conversation with himself: "You're going to be fine! You know you know that piece! Those people really love you, or they wouldn't have bought tickets to come see you!" So, you're going to be fine in that concert. So, we need to prepare that way. And in a kind of a way, what I'm talking about is we need to do that for our whole life. We need to be prepared when we walk into Sears Roebuck or 7-Eleven, that we're going to be happy when we find that that store doesn't have what we came.

**Speaker C:** For.

**Speaker A:** So that we're not going to cause a scene, you're not going to have a tantrum, we're not going to throw merchandise all over the place because they don't have what we want. We don't have to throw a tantrum. We're no longer in knee pants or diapers, so we can get prepared for everything that happens in life so that whatever it is that happens, we're all right. We can handle that too, but that takes an enormous amount of preparation, which would be— when I say preparation, we're talking about repetitive practice of having wholesome, happy thoughts. For instance, Gary, if you have whole thoughts of revenge that are quite delicious, and you're going to hurt this guy and you're going to hurt that guy in the past, and then you walk into 7-Eleven and they don't have the schnitzel you want, what are you gonna do with all of that rage and revenge that you've been practicing all morning? Are you gonna let it out on the store clerk? Hope.

**Speaker C:** Not. It's pointless. I haven't got the big bat in my.

**Speaker A:** Hand. Exactly so. On them, they'll take revenge back on you. That's— in fact, that's the law of karma.

**Speaker C:** Well, that's right. That's right, because that's what stops you from doing it, the knowledge that you might come up against somebody who will rearrange your face with his bat. So it's better to dodge, or it's better not to get into the situation in the beginning.

**Speaker A:** All right, I would say that that would be the first step. That's what we actually mean in ordinary Buddhism, is the Sila, that we teach the children precepts. Okay, and then Christianity, they teach, uh, the Ten Commandments. The Golden Rule is for higher class older people, but young people, they need to know that if they harm somebody, they're going to get harmed back. And so what you do then is that you do those thoughts of harming someone, but you hold back. So that's a kind of a beginner's way. If we can in fact practice correctly so that everything is okay and everything is fine, then those thoughts of revenge, when they come up, we can say, "Hot dog, I see that," and I'm going to put those thoughts of revenge away. Or Thomas, we're going to put those thoughts of anxiety away whenever we see them for what they are: they're harmful. That goes for you, Ivan, also, is to begin to understand what Dukkha is. Dukkha is in fact our dissatisfaction. So when we're in a state of anxiety, we're in a state of dissatisfaction. When we're in a state of having thoughts of revenge, we're in a state of dissatisfaction. Now the thought of the dissatisfaction being eliminated because you actually go and do the revenge is what ordinary people do. In the noble tradition, when we see those thoughts, those thoughts of revenge, those thoughts of anxiety, etc., we say, "Aha, I see you," and then change them. Change them into wholesome, happy.

**Speaker F:** Thoughts.

**Speaker A:** So, I would ask people in general, which do you prefer? Having thoughts of revenge, then, that you're not going to operate on, but it's good to feel like that you can see Donald Trump's head in a vice, or whatever your fantasy is? Or are you going to instead, come out of those kind of feelings and come back into right now everything is okay and everything is happy and no problems and no worries. Think about that for yourself. As I was saying about that house that's on fire, Daddy can't take those older kids out of that house because it's on fire. It's not even a good idea for him to lie to them about it. But when the kids can see for themselves that their house is on fire, they'll do something about it. And so this is the job that we have to do here, is to convince you guys to take a look at what you're doing so that you can see that it's unwholesome, and only then will you practice correctly to come out of it. Anna, you got your hand up again. Go.

**Speaker B:** Ahead. I cannot take it down.

**Speaker A:** Sorry. Oh, well, whatever button that you clicked on the bottom, uh, I've got Chat, Share Screen, Raise Hand. That icon, can you say Raise Hand and click it? Just one click. Just one click. You click it twice, it'll turn it back on. Well, you clicked the wrong thing then. You clicked, uh, turning your camera off. There's a button there someplace. So, getting back to the point, is that practice requires repetition. I strongly recommend everybody, especially new students, to take out 10 minutes at a time, about 6 times a day. This is only an hour a day. That's what they require at Goenka retreat, they require an hour from the Mahasi, they require an hour from the Tibetan, I require an hour, but breaking it up into small segments. In fact, I would say that 5 minutes, 12 times a day, would even be better.

**Speaker C:** Why?

**Speaker A:** Because now it's more frequent, and more frequent, and more frequent, and this is what we need to practice, is over and over and over again, to remember that everything is okay, to remember that these thoughts are unwholesome, let's change them specifically into wholesome.

**Speaker G:** Thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Keep working at it, keep trying at it, over and over and over again, until, as Ivan had mentioned, we're doing it throughout the.

**Speaker C:** Day.

**Speaker A:** You keep practicing, keep doing it throughout the day. Here's the funny thing about that practice of sitting for an hour. That means then that they're practicing in a way to where they have 23 hours of hindrances. Now, a whole life full of hindrances in the past, plus 23 hours of hindrances in the present time, is going to make for pretty slow progress. But if you can practice over and over and over and over and over again, then you're going to get good results. The Buddha talks about it in the sense of Anapanasati, when practiced correctly, will give you great benefit, great results. We have to practice it over and over again. What is that practice? Most specifically is remembering, remembering to look at the kind of thoughts that we're.

**Speaker E:** Having.

**Speaker A:** And then make a change to them. To remember, to look, and to see that thoughts of revenge are unwholesome. Let's change them into, wow, that guy's going to be okay because I'm okay. I'm okay, he's okay. Thomas, when you have anxiety, you can say everything is going to be all right. I don't have to worry about that meeting or whatever. It's just going to be Fine, I'm well prepared with the data. Let me be well prepared with my mind. Let me be free from anxiety. Wow, what a relief it is. See what this.

**Speaker H:** Is.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so we're going to also talk about the breathing because the breathing is kind of an important part of this. Normally our breathing is shallow. The breath body actually is lazy, just like the mind is lazy in a way of, "Oh, well, I've got thoughts of anxiety, I've got thoughts of anger, I've got thoughts of revenge, it's okay, it's too much work. I've got to take the effort to change, and I'm not used to taking that kind of effort, because I don't see the benefit yet." Well, when we're doing it that way, our breathing is not strong. So we really have to start paying attention to our breath. This is why the Buddha actually calls this practice Anapanasati, mindfulness of breathing. That in fact, when we talk about the various aspects of Anapanasati, for instance, gladdening the mind, we do the gladdening of the mind while we're breathing in long, and gladdening the mind while we're breathing out long, mindfully breathing as we're gladdening the mind. When we're developing the skill of feeling safe and secure and comfortable and free from anxiety, then we do that while mindfully watching the breath. Now the breath has several benefits. One is that it energizes us. The more you breathe, in fact, if you breathe heavily over and over again, for instance, has anybody ever run and gone to what they call being out of breath, where you're heaving, you know, like this? How many of you have done.

**Speaker F:** That?

**Speaker A:** All right. Ivan, when that happens, Do you like.

**Speaker B:** It?

**Speaker F:** Um, I mean, as, as I get my breath back, I will like it, I guess.

**Speaker A:** No, everybody says, I want to catch my breath, let me catch my breath. All right, yes, let me stop that heaving that comes naturally when the body is completely out of oxygen. Yes. Okay, so we don't like that heaving. This is why we do what is normally done in Anapanasati, is work with the long breath. But there is a certain kind of breathing that's called the short breath. And the short breath actually goes in the direction of this hyperventilation, the kind of breathing that you do after you've been running or climbing stairs, you're out of breath and you need to breathe. The answer to that is, if the body needs to breathe, go ahead and breathe, and in fact, help it breathe. Extend that breathing. Really help the body by getting it really energized. I mean, if you have the plan of climbing a mountain in your underwear, you've got to breathe. How many of you have heard about the Tibetan practice where the monks put their robes in ice-cold water and then take the robe and put it on. Tubo, you've heard about that? Okay, somebody even knows the name of it. All right, do you think that they're going to be able to hold their breath or breathe shallowly and be able to generate the heat that it takes to put steam out? Are they going to freeze to death under that robe? They've got to get themselves hot, and the way that you get hot like this is by getting enough.

**Speaker D:** Air.

**Speaker A:** That in fact, any sport, one of the most important qualities of learning a really good sport is the ability to breathe. If you can't breathe well, you can't run a 100-yard dash. If you can't breathe well, you can't do boxing. And if you can't breathe well, you're certainly not going to be able to do Asian martial arts. Breathing is the most important quality of it. Now, if we are able then to see that the mind is scattered, wandering away, not able to stay on point, the anxiety is too much, and we're just uptight and whatnot like that, then it might be a good idea to start breathing heavily, or what we call in Anapanasati the short breath. Let me demonstrate. Okay guys, do it. Come on, let's practice. Let's do it together. Follow my lead. Do it. Breathe the way that I'm breathing. Let's get all in rhythm. Come on, Gary. Come on, Carl. Come on, Lars. Breathe with the mouth. Come on, let's go. 5 minutes now. You're not going to drive that robe if you don't get hot. Come on, let's practice. Who's got the thought of how long are we going to do.

**Speaker H:** This?

**Speaker F:** How long are we going to do.

**Speaker A:** This? Until you get good at.

**Speaker F:** It.

**Speaker E:** Sometimes at the end they hold the breath. Either they breathe in and hold it, or and then breathe out and hold it, and hold it for like a minute.

**Speaker A:** Well, let's do what we're doing. All right, so how many of you now are beginning to feel lightheaded? How many of you are beginning to feel energized? Another point is, is that when you're doing this, how many of you are feeling anxiety about a meeting that you're going to go to? Gary, when you're doing this breathing like this and paying attention to the breathing and keeping it going over and over again, are you having thoughts of revenge? Unlikely.

**Speaker C:** No, but I would like to propel you a little beyond this point with a question about the fourth step of Anapanasati, which is calming the body condition.

**Speaker A:** Or in other words, the breath. No, it's relaxing.

**Speaker C:** Relaxing. Are you still breathing long or are you breathing short or what are you doing at that.

**Speaker A:** Stage? Breathing out long. Right. Okay, that's how we relax. So then we would take the session of breathing short, going back to the breathing out long with the emphasis on the out-breathing.

**Speaker G:** Breath.

**Speaker A:** Oh, what a relief it is.

**Speaker C:** Right. Because I was listening to a Dhamma talk by another monk, which he seemed to be saying that you should at that stage be taking very short breaths in and out when you're calming.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's what we've been doing, except that I wouldn't say so. We've been doing, that's energizing the body. Taking these deep short breaths energize the body. What do I mean by energize? It means that we're taking in oxygen, we're putting that oxygen in the bloodstream, and that bloodstream actually then starts to burn off all of the stuff in the blood that can be burned off. For instance, adrenaline can get burned off. What adrenaline? The adrenaline of anxiety, the adrenaline of having thoughts of revenge. And so we burn off that adrenaline, and then we can find relaxation after we do this session of long— or excuse me, the short breathing that gets us completely energized. And if you think of thoughts of revenge or you want to do something else, then never mind. Let's go back and do some more of this. We didn't do enough of it. 5 minutes wasn't enough. 10 minutes. Does anybody actually— was anybody keeping track of actually how long we did that? Nobody was paying any attention to how long it took. That's the way of time is that we don't know how much time it took. We're not watching the clock, we're watching our breath. But if you continue to do that, all of the problems that you've got will melt away, because the only thing you've got on your mind is, "Let's take that next deep breath." That's real mindfulness. That's why that short breath practice is actually part of Anapanasati, is because you can't hardly do anything other than just watch that breath, but the whole body will become completely energized. This is the kind of breathing that those monks do when they're drying that wet, 0-degree Celsius robe that they've just dipped in the cold, icy water. In fact, the practice is, can you make that robe steam? Can you get the body so energized and so hot that it actually doesn't just melt, or let's say, dry clothes the way that the Sun does, that the clothes actually throw steam off? Guess what? In order to do that, those monks have to breathe that short breath a whole lot longer than we have in this session. If they stop at the level that we stopped at, they're going to get ice.

**Speaker E:** Cold. Really? Also imagine a visualized fire or.

**Speaker A:** Something. Well, that's getting hot, isn't it? Visualizations don't work unless you've got the power to do it. So the Anapanasati— I mean, can you, uh, understand that somebody can't climb Mount Kilimanjaro in his underwear if he's only thinking about.

**Speaker E:** Fire?

**Speaker A:** He's not going to do it. He's got to get the body energized. He's got to get that fat burning.

**Speaker E:** Off. I have a problem with cold feet in the winter, but I wear battery-powered.

**Speaker F:** Insoles.

**Speaker A:** Start doing some Anapanasati. You may not have to waste so many.

**Speaker F:** Batteries.

**Speaker E:** But I don't know, I have to work at the computer, so I can't be just breathing all the time.

**Speaker A:** Like, but why not breathe and then type, and then breathe and then type, and breathe for 3 or 4 minutes and type a paragraph, and then breathe again? This is what Anapanasati really is all about, is can you remember to keep coming back to the practice? Can you keep watching this breath, keep getting it back again? Ivan, you got your hand up.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, basically what Lawrence has asked. I understand that sometimes there's just this, like, people, sometimes I hear people set timer throughout the day. It's like reminding themselves, okay, it's time to be mindful of the breath again. Like, is that helpful, right?

**Speaker A:** Like, yes, it is. That in fact, doing this short breath is quite helpful in helping us to remember to breathe. That in fact, I can work with you on the long breath and you'll forget all about it. But now that we've done 3 or 4 minutes of this short breath, you guys are going to remember this. You're going to remember that we did.

**Speaker E:** This.

**Speaker A:** And so you can remember, and then you can start to practice. So whenever you feel tired, this is the practice to do. Whenever you've got thoughts that are really hard to get rid of, when you've got thoughts of revenge that are so delicious that you want to keep them, start practicing the short breath. Because you can't do anything else but the short breathing while you're doing it. If you forget and start thinking of thoughts of revenge, you'll go back to the ordinary breath again. Same thing is true with anxiety. Thomas, got a question for you. While you were doing that breathing, and for quite a while after, Where's that.

**Speaker D:** Anxiety? Yeah, I guess I wasn't thinking about the anxiety while I was doing it.

**Speaker A:** No, you.

**Speaker F:** Weren'T.

**Speaker D:** But the practice is— that's a kind of a diversion tactic, if that's the right way of using it or saying it. But then afterwards, I felt really calm. I noticed like 5 minutes since we did that, I kind of worked myself up a little bit, but now I feel quite— there's a stronger sort of awareness, mind-body connection, I guess, and I feel quite calm. So that's— and then you can revert to the longer breaths, right, to sort of just calm down.

**Speaker A:** Right. So we return to the long breath. Now, here's one point about that, and that is that when we're breathing this way, either the long breath Or the short breath. Both of those breaths have several qualities to them that is different than ordinary breathing. One is that ordinary breathing is absent-minded. Another one is that it does not energize, it keeps the status quo. Another one is that because we're breathing in a shallow way, carbon dioxide and other pollutions that are small, like amino acids when they're breaking down, including the residue of adrenaline, stay in the bloodstream and stay in the lungs. Well, when we start breathing mindfully breathing, either breathing out and breathing in long, or breathing in short and breathing out short, then we're actually purifying the body. That gives the body a chance to unload, take the garbage out, get rid of all of the buildup of carbon dioxide in the body, and then in fact we can think better. We can behave better, we can act better, we have actually more wholesome thoughts when we're really energized. So, if you get tired, if you're a slave at the desk and you're doing what you'd normally do and you get tired in the morning, if you will take the time to do this short breathing, you'll get yourself energized, you'll get all the pollutions out of the body, it'll help you wake up and you can do your job better. So let us say that you've got work to do and it takes you an hour to get the work done. If you'll take 5 minutes and breathe in long and breathe out, breathe in short, breathe out short for 5 minutes twice during that session, you'll be able to get the job done in half the time. Why? Because when we get tired, what do we do? We go off into a very, very shallow breathing and fill the blood full of a bunch of crap. That's what tiredness actually is, is when the blood is full of crap. And so we take it easy, we don't breathe well. But if you actually take good deep breathing, it will help a.

**Speaker E:** Lot.

**Speaker A:** So I would highly recommend— don't talk about the short breath except on occasion, but since we had a question about it, If you keep doing this short breath the way that I'm telling you to do it, you can climb at least your own ladders in your underwear. You can at least climb stairs in your underwear. You could at least climb uphill in your underwear. Maybe you can even climb Mount Kilimanjaro if you can still keep breathing. Even if your underwear is soaking wet, you keep breathing. Breathing long, get that oxygen in there and let that go. Here's an example of that. Have you ever heard of alligator wrestling? They do it with snakes. Mongooses do this with snakes. Reptiles don't have good breathing apparatus, they don't have a good circulation system, and so when the alligator is being wrestled, and he's fighting, you see what— if you'll notice, the way alligators do is they'll sit very, very quiet and wait, and then just at the right moment, they'll pounce, and then they'll chew. But alligator wrestling is completely different. That alligator's got to get involved. And guess what? The alligator wrestler is doing one important thing. He's making that alligator tired, because humans can breathe well and keep their energy up, while the alligator, his muscles are going to atrophy, they're going to get tight, and he's going to be able to not continue the fight. That's when the alligator wrestler then takes over. The same thing with the mongoose. If you've ever seen those videos of the cobra and the mongoose, what does the mongoose do? He's waiting there for for the cobra to strike, and to strike, and to strike over and over again, and pretty soon the cobra gets tired, and that's when the mongoose comes in and attacks the snake. So, that's what happens with humans that don't know about how to breathe. Ordinary people don't have the endurance the way that an athlete does, and you'd say, "Well, the athlete is trained." Well, what is he actually training? A lot of the training is in breathing. So I would highly recommend that you actually start using this application of Anapanasati, start breathing well. If you breathe well, your endurance will go up. If you're sick, you'll get better sooner because you're breathing well. The body can repair itself when it's got the tools to do that. But if you feel sick and tired, then that tiredness is going to keep you sick. But if you start breathing well while you're sick, you'll get out of it. So, today we have talked about anxiety, we've talked about the mind and getting the mind free from the anxiety, and so we've done it in several different ways: with the long breath, in that long breath we have an opportunity to see those thoughts so that we can change them. When they're in the short breath, we don't have an opportunity to see those thoughts because we're spending all of our time in the mindfulness of keeping that breathing going. In both cases, it's wholesome. So, if you're full of revenge, if you're full of anxiety, if you're full of crap, The thing to do is to start breathing. Either breathing long and pay attention to the crap, or start breathing short, and then you can't think of anything.

**Speaker C:** Crappy.

**Speaker A:** All right, so let's finish with this talk. How about you, Mickey, you have anything to say?

**Speaker H:** Mikey? Yeah, thank you for the wonderful talk, Dhammarato, and so glad to see so many friends here today. If y'all would go ahead and check out opensanghafoundation.org, we've been improving the design and flow of the website. It's easier to navigate and find things now, and Yeah, if you haven't yet, please sign up. Put your real name and a profile picture of yourself and let's get connected. The Buddha, you know, made a point of saying that the Sangha is one of the Triple Gems. So we've heard the Buddha, Dharma here today. And let's remember that it's worthwhile to be involved with.

**Speaker A:** Sangha. Excellent. Thank you for the pep talk. Thomas with a TH, the one with, uh, who used to have a long time ago, deep, so far in the past we've forgotten about it, the.

**Speaker E:** Anxiety.

**Speaker A:** How you.

**Speaker F:** Doing?

**Speaker D:** Um, I'm good. I found the That breathing exercise really, really helped, really practical actually. And I thought of another area. I often, in the middle of the work day when you're on Zoom fatigue and all this sort of stuff, it could be a really great thing to fit into your day. Because at the moment when I'm feeling tired, I go to YouTube and I just binge on probably crap on YouTube. So I'm gonna try it like Throughout the day and see how that goes. There's a different way of energizing myself after a long meeting or something like that. So I thought that's a really.

**Speaker A:** Good Anagami. Very good. So Thomas with a T-U-O, how you doing? You have anything to.

**Speaker G:** Say? Everything is okay. I really enjoyed the short breath. That was a really— I have forgotten about it. So thank you for reminding me of that. That was really effective in energizing.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. Energizing, huh? All tingly. You keep doing it, you'll get— they call it hyperventilation, but really what it is all about is getting really clean. That in fact, that's akin to the Piti, where the body gets completely energized. So you can go practice this longer than we did it together. Go set a timer and see if you can do this for 10 minutes. And in fact, I know a group of people who practice it for 45 minutes, but they normally need a guide. What do I mean by a guide? That means somebody who is sitting there with you, and as soon as you stop breathing this way, they'll say, "Stew it, do it, do it, get back on." They start pounding on your chest and get you back into it. Okay? But I would recommend starting for 10 minutes at a time. Ben, you just joined.

**Speaker F:** Us.

**Speaker D:** I've been here the whole time, but just without video.

**Speaker A:** It was very good, thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker F:** I feel.

**Speaker G:** Satisfied. Just one question about the short breathing. I know in Pranayama they recommend to do those energizing breaths with an empty stomach. Does it matter here? Can we do the— short breathing for 10 minutes with a full stomach?

**Speaker A:** I don't care. The full stomach, I think, has to do with swimming. So maybe they'll think that you'll get the bends or something, but if you're sitting in your chair, you get the bends, you're not going to.

**Speaker C:** Drown.

**Speaker A:** So I don't think that the full stomach has anything to do with it at all. That in fact, here's one of the things, is that if you've got all of this oxygen, you're going to have really good digestion on that full stomach. So Ross, how about.

**Speaker E:** You? Me?

**Speaker A:** Oh, Ross. Yeah. Huey.

**Speaker F:** Chan. Who?

**Speaker D:** I was just thinking the short breathing, it's a lot of people use it to get themselves hot. However, I'm in the middle of summer, it's like 38 degrees outside. I don't really want to heat my body up, I'm trying to cool down a lot. I don't know if there's a way.

**Speaker A:** That'S— So go take a cold shower and do it. In fact, this is something that happens. Have you ever taken a cold shower? Yeah, I mean really cold. What do you do with your breathing when you're having a cold shower? Right, you start.

**Speaker H:** Breathing.

**Speaker E:** That's what the Iceman recommends, but it's hard to get motivated to take cold shower. He recommends to do like a cold shower at the end of your.

**Speaker A:** Shower. So Carl with a C, how you doing? Yeah, all good, Dhammarato. Good to be back. Have been a little bit off the Dharma, but yeah, very, very good talk. Really appreciate it. And it was also very good advice, I think, with this not being— not overplanned for, you know, being overexcited with regards to meetings and I think it's very— just come unprepared but in the natural state. Well, be prepared. Yeah, be prepared, but not— yeah, right. Don't be uptight and know what you need to know. And if you don't know nothing, then still be prepared emotionally. Say, I don't care, I don't know, you're the boss, you figure it.

**Speaker F:** Out.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Ivan, how you.

**Speaker F:** Doing? Yeah, I'm just thinking about the Shambhala, just thinking that I need to do more of that.

**Speaker B:** That's.

**Speaker A:** All. How about you.

**Speaker E:** Anna?

**Speaker A:** You're kind of new to this stuff.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I also enjoy the breathing. I got a little bit of lightheaded, but I'm doing it now.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yeah, go get lightheaded. What does that mean? Actually, what lightheaded means is that you're energized, you're full of pep, vim, vigor. You're really ready to go.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I'm gonna keep.

**Speaker A:** Practicing. So Basil, how are you doing? Karl with a K, how about.

**Speaker F:** You? I'm doing good, doing good, breathing well, just breathing, you know, the same old stuff, but Feels new every time.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, we've got quite a crowd today, so if anybody has any last remarks, now's the time. Anybody got anything to.

**Speaker I:** Say? Yeah, I mean, um, yes, okay, I recommend, because I had already been doing the short breath sometimes because I read about it on that book, uh, made from a lecture, from some lectures by, or some talks by Buddhadasa, 'Meditation for Serious Beginners,' I think it's called. And it's online and it talks about the short breath. And if I remember correctly, it recommends doing it sometimes at the beginning of Anapanasati. And I recommend people to check it out because it's, I found it.

**Speaker A:** Interesting. Well, it's a book to learn how to practice. I would, I've talked often about it. Bhante Carl, when he translated that book, he didn't quite understand everything about the teaching of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, and Bhikkhu Buddhadasa didn't speak English, and so they wound up with the title of Anapanasati for Serious Beginners. And I recommend, don't be serious. If you're really going to get this stuff done, You're going to have to be light-hearted about it, but persistent. So I would say then we can change that from serious into persistent. Keep doing it. Okay, so anybody else got any last words? Speak now or forever hold your peace. Not forever, just until next.

**Speaker H:** Time.

**Speaker A:** All right guys, thank you so much. Wow, what a crowd we've had.

**Speaker F:** Today. See you, Dhammarato. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you, everyone.

**Speaker A:** See you next week. See you next week.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A), is an open community discussion focused on practical Buddhist teachings for dealing with unwholesome mental states, particularly **anxiety** and **thoughts of revenge**.

Here is a summary of the key points:

### Core Theme: Recognizing and Replacing Unwholesome Thoughts
The central teaching is that we cannot change a habit of mind (like anxiety or revenge fantasies) until we first **see it clearly as a source of suffering (*dukkha*)**. Dhammarato uses the analogy of a house on fire: you won't leave until you see and feel the danger for yourself. Similarly, we only abandon our "favorite bad feelings" when we recognize they are burning us from within.

### Main Practical Teachings:

1.  **The First Step is Awareness:** The practice begins with noticing when unwholesome thoughts arise. The moment you think, "Aha, there's my anxiety" or "There's my revenge fantasy," you create the opportunity for change.

2.  **Change the Thought, Don't Just Suppress It:** Once you see the thought as unwholesome, you actively replace it with a wholesome, happy thought. For example:
    *   Replace anxiety about a future meeting with: "Everything is okay. I will be fine regardless of the outcome."
    *   Replace a revenge fantasy with: "That person is probably suffering already. My anger only harms me."

3.  **The Role of Breathing (*Ānāpānasati*):** Mindfulness of breath is the primary tool for this work.
    *   **Long Breaths:** Used to calm and steady the mind, creating the space to observe and gladden the mind.
    *   **Short, Energizing Breaths:** A key practical demonstration was a session of vigorous, short breathing. This technique:
        *   Energizes the body and clears the mind.
        *   Is so absorbing that it crowds out anxious or angry thoughts.
        *   Purifies the body by oxygenating the blood and burning off stress chemicals like adrenaline.
        *   Can be used as a "reset" during the day (e.g., after Zoom fatigue) instead of turning to distractions.

4.  **Preparation Through Practice:** You cannot expect to be calm in a crisis if you haven't practiced in peace. The recommendation is to practice in short, frequent sessions (e.g., 5-10 minutes, 6-12 times a day) to constantly re-train the mind toward wholesomeness.

5.  **Skillful vs. Unskillful "Preparation":** For events like a meeting, there are two types of preparation:
    *   **Unskillful:** Obsessively planning while filled with anxiety, which you then carry into the event.
    *   **Skillful:** Acquiring necessary knowledge *while also* practicing to be emotionally calm and unattached to the outcome. The ideal is to enter a situation prepared yet relaxed, free from the burden of anxiety.

### Community Dialogue:
The talk was interactive, with Sangha friends sharing their experiences:
*   **Gary (Speaker C)** identified revenge fantasies as a "favorite bad feeling," noting they provide a thrilling but binding form of false joy.
*   **Thomas (Speaker D)** and others explored how to handle future anxiety and the need to let go of clinging to a specific result.
*   **Anna (Speaker B)** mentioned nostalgia as a bittersweet, sometimes depressing, state.
*   **Ivan (Speaker F)** asked about causing harm to others and how to handle guilt, with the advice being to use that recognition to be more mindful *in the future*.

### Conclusion:
The talk emphasized that the path is one of **persistent, light-hearted practice**. By repeatedly using mindfulness of breath to see our unwholesome thoughts and consciously replace them with wholesome ones, we can gradually free ourselves from suffering, live with more ease, and handle life's challenges with a calm and ready mind.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by the speaker (Dhammarato) to illustrate the teachings:

### 1. **The House on Fire**
   - **Story**: A father tries to get his children out of a burning house. He first lies about a "golden chariot" outside to lure them out (skillful means), but the better approach is to simply tell them the truth—the house is on fire—and let them realize the danger themselves when they feel the smoke and heat.
   - **Purpose**: To illustrate how the Dharma is taught. You can’t force people to practice; they must see for themselves that their "house" (life, mind) is burning with **dukkha** (suffering, anxiety, unwholesome thoughts). Only when they recognize the "fire" will they be motivated to change.

### 2. **The Concert Pianist / Athlete Preparation**
   - **Metaphor**: A concert pianist or athlete must practice for years to perform well. They need both **technical preparation** (knowing the music, plays) and **emotional preparation** (managing stage fright, anxiety).
   - **Purpose**: To emphasize that overcoming anxiety or unwholesome thoughts requires **both** knowledge/skill and emotional training. You can’t just “wing it” without practice, and you must prepare your mind to be calm and resilient.

### 3. **Climbing a Mountain in Your Underwear / Tibetan Monk Drying a Robe**
   - **Story**: Tibetan monks practice **Tummo** (inner heat) meditation by dipping robes in icy water and then drying them on their bodies through intense breathing and visualization.
   - **Metaphor**: Just as the monks use vigorous breathing to generate heat and dry the robe, we can use **short, energizing breaths** (a form of *ānāpānasati*) to “energize” the body, burn off adrenaline, and purify the mind.
   - **Purpose**: To show the power of mindful breathing to transform physical and mental states—especially for overcoming lethargy, anxiety, or distracting thoughts.

### 4. **Alligator Wrestler / Mongoose vs. Cobra**
   - **Metaphor**: The alligator wrestler tires out the alligator by using superior endurance and breathing. Similarly, the mongoose defeats the cobra by letting it strike repeatedly until exhausted.
   - **Purpose**: To illustrate how **proper breathing builds endurance**—both physically and mentally. Those who breathe mindfully can outlast negative mental states (like anxiety or revenge fantasies), which eventually lose power when you don’t feed them.

### 5. **Trump Supporters’ Anger**
   - **Metaphor**: The speaker references Trump supporters clinging to “thoughts of revenge” and anger, which he compares to a form of **bondage**—their only joy comes from harming others (in thought), which keeps them “stuck” and unhappy.
   - **Purpose**: To show how unwholesome thoughts (revenge, anger) create internal suffering and cycle of dissatisfaction, even if they feel “delicious” in the moment.

### 6. **Golden Chariot Lie**
   - **Story**: The father lying about a golden chariot to save his children is presented as a form of “skillful means,” but the speaker critiques it—suggesting honesty is better, and that people must ultimately see the truth for themselves.
   - **Purpose**: To question manipulative teachings and emphasize the Buddha’s way: pointing out **dukkha** directly, without scare tactics or deception, so that people awaken to their own situation.

### 7. **Going to Sears Roebuck or 7-Eleven**
   - **Metaphor**: If you go to a store and they don’t have what you want, do you throw a tantrum? Or have you practiced enough to stay happy and not cause a scene?
   - **Purpose**: To show that **mindfulness practice** is for everyday life—preparing us to handle disappointments and frustrations with equanimity.

### 8. **Hyperventilation vs. Mindful Short Breathing**
   - **Metaphor**: The “short breath” practice is compared to the energized, heaving breath after running—but done mindfully, it becomes a tool for purification and focus, not panic.
   - **Purpose**: To distinguish between anxious, chaotic breathing and **intentional short breaths** used in meditation to energize the body and crowd out unwholesome thoughts.

---

### **Overall Theme of Metaphors**:
The speaker uses vivid, physical metaphors (fire, breathing, wrestling, climbing) to make abstract Buddhist concepts—like *dukkha*, *ānāpānasati*, and *right effort*—tangible and practical. The stories reinforce the idea that **seeing suffering clearly** and **consistent practice** are essential for transformation, and that the body (especially the breath) is a direct gateway to mastering the mind.
