### Transcript


**Speaker A:** My girlfriend and I.

**Speaker B:** Well, I say.

**Speaker A:** Girlfriend, but a previous girlfriend and I broke it up now for about almost a week and a half, I think. And well, it's definitely come with its challenges. You know, like, we're still living in the same place. So all of the like patterns and mind moments that come up when we were together are still coming up, even though we're not together. So like, you know, she pulls up to the driveway or, you know, I hear the door open to the house. Those were like, in the past, they were signals to like greet her to like say hi or, you know, and now we're being more kind of to ourselves. It's interesting though, there's been a, like, at some point it just got really bad and I was like, okay, I gotta turn this around. Like, if I don't turn this around, we know where this is going.

**Speaker C:** So.

**Speaker A:** I basically just, you know, I just started practicing more and being kind of like gentle, rigorous about where my mind goes and where it doesn't go. And that's been awesome. And like, I've been able to start seeing that these moments of, you know, craving, or, you know, like, I want to be with her, or I want her attention, that at first those thoughts were just really hard to even see. But now I've started to make more space for them. And it's kind of easier to even just have them be there and still feel peace. You know, because it's like, if I'm— it's interesting, like, you know how we like throw out unwholesome thoughts, right? So, or relax out of them. And I was thinking, well, I'm starting to crave not wanting to have these thoughts.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So the practice, I saw like a moment where it became like, practice was a problem. Or at least I was making it a problem. So then I was like, well, wait, Okay, well then there's really nothing wrong. The thoughts can be there too. That's fine. And then the peace doesn't falter, which is nice. What I wanted to talk to you guys about is, I've had kind of like the runaround with this relationship. Like, we've tried this multiple times. We've broken up, gotten back together twice.

**Speaker D:** Well.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, kinda. And it's interesting that the more and more we take space from each other, I've noticed that all of these aspects that were unwholesome in the relationship, I'm seeing a great portion of them having to do with my own stuff. So, you know, like if she goes to the bar and she's like dressed all cute, when we were together I would think, oh man, like there's a guy that's going to approach her. I'm like afraid of that or whatever. Well, those thoughts are still going on even though we're not together. And it's like, well, wait a minute, that's really interesting. Here we are not together, the mind doesn't know the difference. So I just realized, like, all right, I need to face some of this stuff. And so as I've been facing more of that, I've been seeing this, like, possibility for a new view of her to emerge, that what's been there this entire time has been my mix, like the mix of my stuff on top of that view. So I can't see her purely. And so it's interesting, right? Because there's like all these things that I don't know, like she might complain, right? She might complain often. Well, we're not together right now. So I don't listen to her like I did before. So I don't have her around complaining. But now I'm noticing I want to be with her. I want to spend more time with her. And is it possible that there is just this, you know, once this kind of peace starts developing more and more and more, and you start making peace with these unwholesome aspects of yourself, and you start realizing that they were a contributor to the relationship, that whatever that person does or doesn't do that might be quote-unquote unwholesome becomes kind of less of a significant thing. And there's just like a real pure possibility of like, oh, okay, I could just take a step back and I could actually like love her as she is. And It doesn't have to shape my piece. Now, of course, there's also that conflict of functionality. If you're with someone that's complaining often or sabotages themselves, that's going to be difficult in terms of a partnership. If you have someone that's more.

**Speaker B:** Trying.

**Speaker A:** To go upstream, So I just kind of wanted to like see what your guys' thoughts were about that. I guess the question is, if you are seeing these things within yourself, like I am, and you see there are these reasons for why you didn't want to be with someone before, but you're seeing all these things in yourself that are opening up this new view. How can I kind of trust, like, what's right? Like, what's right here? Not like the right answer, but like, what's actually wholesome? And what is best for me? You know, I don't want to just go based on my feelings of like, oh, I want to be with her. So, you know, and then all this stuff happens that's wrong again, or a problem again. Obviously, I think what I've realized is that we do need to take time apart. It's this time apart that is allowing for all this to happen. So we've got to keep doing this. That's evidence of like, okay, this is good data. These are great results. Let's keep taking space. But we have this lease for 6 months. We've considered the possibility in the past of maybe just going out on dates and stuff. But not moving in together after this. What do you guys think in terms of, you know, you have this old view, you have this new view. How do I know which one to trust? How do I know I'm not just going to be basically settling or, you know, kind of pulling the wool over my eyes, right? It's kind of long-winded, but I needed to say it. Thank you.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I think continuing to just approach it from kind of that investigation, but also like the friendship aspect, right? And so coming from a place of friendship and really seeing like, yeah, you know what, you know, how can you be, you know, good friends with yourself and good friends with her? And part of that is understanding, hey, we do need a little bit of, you you know, space. And that can be quite beneficial, right? And I think too, like, maybe throwing out any strong, solidified, like, expectations of, like, how this will go one way or another way, right? Like, either strongly for it or against it, and just being like, okay, we'll investigate as time goes on. Because again, both of you are subject to change, right? And various different things. But I think it's really good that, like, you're seeing too, like, No, the noticing of like the thoughts of like, oh, I don't want to have this thought or whatever when it comes to like changing them and removing them and all that stuff and just being like, oh wait, no, because that stuff, yeah, it's going to be natural that those feelings are going to arise, that they're going to come up. So it's just like, okay, let me change this to like a healthy sort of, you know, place to a wholesome sort of place. But yeah, discerning that does, it's like you know, a moment-to-moment thing of being able to recognize, okay, what is wholesome here and now, and in terms of, you know, the situation.

**Speaker C:** So yeah, that sounds like some really great practice. Like, as you ask the question, how do you know what's wholesome, what's not? And it can only come to you in the moment. You will not know from this perspective right now as you're— if you're not with her and you're not doing something together, she doesn't like give you any feedback. So you will not have any Dukkha. So you will come from this clean slate perspective of you can see yourself very clearly. The question comes, can you see yourself clearly when you're in relationship with that people? Because as we talked about, like practicing in isolation, it's like it's super— it tends to become easier and easier. But then when we go out in the world the relationship with our people, with objects, is we start getting overwhelmed by the information. And then we can really lose the track of our thoughts and lose the track of Dukkha. So you will only know if you're hanging out and you're able to maintain this new view, the things you learned in your isolation. If you're able to take that now to the relationship, then it can really, really grow into something. For you. Okay, that's how I say it. Yeah, yeah. And I'm in a relationship as well, so I see that as well. A lot of time you need to like give yourself that space to see like, oh wait, that's just me being like a little bitch, or that's just me being, you know, like you see yourself generating this like Dukkha about other person. And it's really physical, like anything physical outside of yourself doesn't have that much effect on you, how you feel, how you see that person. You can see them clearly as like they're complaining, but that's all it is. Like, how many times have you complained? How many times have I complained? And we're just judging them based on this new view that we're not complaining right now. But for sure.

**Speaker A:** Right, right, right.

**Speaker C:** That space that if you're able to create that space for them to complain, and then you're really getting somewhere because now, now you're taking your practice and you're actually applying it in relationship with people. If you're staying calm, if you're listening, if you're able to see that, oh, they're just having a bad day or having a bad moment. That's how I see it. And it can be difficult. It's not like a 100% ratio, even in my life.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Thanks, guys. That was really good.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** But it sounds like you get a lot of great insight, which is really great.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and it's crazy, right? Like, there's just— man, I don't know, like, okay, and like, what's strange is all like this new view of her is opening up, right? But we've decided to not be together right now. So there's like this, ah, wait, come to me, like, let's go on a walk, like, let's go do something fun. And just knowing, right, like that.

**Speaker D:** I.

**Speaker A:** Mean, I don't want to say that that's not a possibility, but that is kind of what it is. You know, we've decided to like create that boundary and take space. It's just sometimes challenging to, and confusing, right? To know like, is this interest in, you know, wanting to spend time with her, is that coming from like a cool peace, like a non-attached peace, or is that coming from attachment and desire and all the same issues that we basically were dealing with when we were in the relationship.

**Speaker C:** So yeah, well, you got new toys, so you can play with them every time you go out now. Now you have some of these things that you've been practicing with, so you can see them now. If you can see them while you're by yourself, you can see them in relationship to it as well. It's just a matter of question, can you hold on to that attitude and continue seeing them as they arise while you're in a relationship with that?

**Speaker A:** Right, right, right, right, right. Thanks, guys.

**Speaker D:** Also, welcome there, Caleb and Robert.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, welcome, guys.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, what's up?

**Speaker B:** Glad to be here. Figured I'd join in on the UK Sangha just to see what was up.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, not purely UK, as you can tell.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, we've infested, us dirty Americans.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, it's just a time zone thing. So.

**Speaker B:** Do you know what time the US Sangha, if there is one, usually goes up on Skype?

**Speaker D:** Um, that one I believe is like It's like 10 PM, like Eastern Standard Time now. Um, yeah, on Fridays.

**Speaker B:** So that's cool, that's cool. I work then, so I cannot attend to that, but I'm free at this hour.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, there's always like the one— even on— there's one on Sunday, but I think that for US that might be quite late. That might be like 11 o'clock. No. No, like 12, 12 at night. Yeah, it's UK time is like 10, 10 AM.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, the, um, the one on Sundays is like 5 AM Eastern Standard Time, so sometimes I'll make that one.

**Speaker B:** That's like right when I get off work.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, okay, there you go. So that— yeah, and normally Dhammarato's in.

**Speaker B:** That one, so very nice.

**Speaker D:** That's pretty cool. Have a little chat.

**Speaker C:** How are you, Robert? I heard you had a good day.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, really good.

**Speaker D:** Really good.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, Robert, that's awesome. Good job, man.

**Speaker B:** Was there anything y'all in particular came together to talk about today? Like, was there a purpose, or is it just sort of the general hangout?

**Speaker A:** Just general hangout.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah. If you want to share something.

**Speaker B:** It's like, yeah, well, I was just wondering, and I asked this question on the Dhamma Dudes Discord already, but what's the best place to put your awareness when you meditate? Because I noticed that I can either let it flow free and do whatever it wants, or I can choose an object of concentration and just sit it on that, and it'll branch out from that to other objects. Does that make sense? I'm not the best at explaining stuff.

**Speaker D:** But I'm just trying to make sense. Yeah, yeah, attention. You can have like— oh, go ahead, DJ. Oh yeah, no, uh, you can go ahead there, Robert.

**Speaker C:** Oh, okay.

**Speaker D:** Um, you can have like a center of attention and then like a peripheral attention that's bigger.

**Speaker B:** That's for sure, that's for sure. That's even true just for our vision. Like, we've got the periphery and the pupil vision at the center.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, that's true. There's quite a bit of a relation there almost with the way that the awareness sort of functions. Yeah, it's like the center and then the peripheral. But yeah, I think I kind of responded a bit to that one. Um, but yeah, for like the, um, Anapanasati practice, the main thing with the breath, right, is it is like that anchor for Sati. So the main thing is just to know like, okay, this is a long you know, in-breath, or this is a long out-breath. And so I think in terms of like the awareness, we can be quite playful with it in that regard. It's really just noticing, like, okay, on that in-breath and on that out-breath, because that gives us an anchor for Sati, remembering to pay attention to what's going on here and now. But again, that's also applying the other aspects too, right? So the viewing as well as the effort. So we're now discerning, okay, is this thought that's coming in wholesome or unwholesome? And then we're going to change that thought to a wholesome thought and then sustain those wholesome thoughts, right? But the breath that we're coming back to, that as an anchor, plus it's really nice for that stability, for that grounding. Taking the long breaths really helps to oxygenate the body and is kind of, again, it's wholesome in its own own right as well, because you have to be here now in order to discern, is this long, is this short? You know, you're not going to be thinking about the breath from last Tuesday. It's this breath right here, right now.

**Speaker C:** So yeah, yeah, I guess I can, I can add on that and try to explain like what, how I see it and the concept. So for example, awareness, you're aware of everything. You're aware that everything is surrounding you at all times. As you're calming yourself down. We can use, for example, water glass, water cup as an example. If your awareness shifts to, I want to have a sip of water, but the water is not in your peripheral awareness, then you're gonna go get it. It's the same with awareness. Where awareness tends to move on to is the object that you're needing to focus. For example, if you're seeing the thought comes up that is unsatisfying, so you're gonna move awareness towards that. If everything is okay, then there's no need for awareness to be anywhere. There's no need for it to reach and cling onto a cup or an object or anything else. You can just sit and relax in it. That's how I kind of see it. It just sits and melts into everything. It comes out in relation if there's an object to focus on, and as the DJ explained in Anapanasati, we're using breath, and then from breath we can see if there's any thoughts, we can see if there's any tension in the body, and we can move with awareness through that. And then if there's none of that, we just allow awareness to be. We don't need to make any rules for that one meditation session where it's like, oh, okay, this is what's been said, so I'm gonna focus my awareness on this object, or I'm gonna just do this. Just, it's like a game. You play with it. You see where it needs to go and you allow it. That's a lot.

**Speaker B:** Well, I've noticed that even when trying to focus on the breath, it might be easy for a few minutes, but then your attention sort of starts to stutter a little bit, and it will switch from objects of interest out of boredom. At least that's just me. I've noticed that if you even allow your mind to do that, you can also let go of that in and of itself. And so without even having to note, you're also aware of the breath and the mental continuum.

**Speaker C:** Yes, so you brought awareness towards that object that came up. The object that came up is like, oh, it's hard to maintain awareness on the breath. So you brought awareness onto that thought, and now you're saying, oh wait, I can actually maintain my breath and think at the same time while I'm thinking this thing. And then you completely diluted that, and then you can say, wait, I don't even need necessarily these thoughts or the breath in order to maintain awareness, and you melt back into it. So you just explained exactly what I was trying to explain, is like as it arises, you play with it as it arises. That's the only way I can actually conceptualize from my own language is as it arises, you just play with it wherever you feel it fits.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I think another wonderful thing to bring up here too is like, say, when a hindrance or whatever does arise, like say, you know, boredom, right, is that is also just the spotting of it, right, is actually doing the correct sort of practice, right? And so having that moment where you spot it and then having that congratulations— like, this is why sometimes using a small phrase or something like, "Aha, I see you," you know, can be quite lovely. It's like you're playing a game, right? And as you spot it, it's like, wow, you know, this was spotted. And then you just return back to enjoying the breath. I think that's the other thing too, right, is it's also taking the time to really enjoy the breath as well with some of these long breaths, like really enjoying the sensations and that just this breath right now is enough as well. So coming back to the content, to the satisfaction, that just this one right now is enough.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that really does bring you right to the moment. It took me many years to realize that just thinking about the past or planning for the future can be useful in moderation, but it's sort of a waste of time to an extent because all your power is here in the moment.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, exactly. And it is often like, yeah, like just a little bit here and there can be helpful, but often it is overdone and it's not very beneficial. So it's like we can just come back to here and now with the breath and just enjoy this and be satisfied, content, at ease. And bringing in again, when the hindrances are spotted, but regardless, is actually cultivating this feeling of success of like, yeah, this is successful. Just being here, taking these long breaths, this is successful enough. And really, yeah, just basking in that because that builds the confidence and the confidence loops back to the satisfaction. And it's just this beautiful thing that just keeps rolling. And then even, yeah, when thoughts come up of boredom, it's like, oh yeah, that's cool. Whoa, we spotted boredom.

**Speaker A:** Great.

**Speaker D:** And then just keep on rolling.

**Speaker B:** It's weird though, because when it happens to me, it's not like I think to myself, oh, I'm bored. It's more so that I've become agitated to a small extent, and then my attention gets loose.

**Speaker D:** Yes, like sometimes it can be quite like almost subtle in a sense. It's not like, oh, I'm bored, or it's, it's, it's, yeah, just the subtle things, and then it kind of has gone off.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, there's many, many forms of thoughts. Like, it's not, it's not usually— it can be not verbal, it can be like imagery, it can be like super fast. That's why, like, we've been talking, I think, months ago about, like, the reaction time. As reaction time goes up, you're able to spot them more and more faster. Even these, like, more subtle ones, is like the, like, little tensions in the body. You can spot a little tension, like a little tension in my shoulder, to tell me that I'm bored, like, oh, I need to move my body. Things like that. There's a— there's— it seems to be like there's a lot to it that unveils itself once you start like really, really paying attention and really just melting yourself down.

**Speaker B:** So how has meditation in your daily practice had— I know a lot of people say, oh, the meditation is the benefit, but what benefits that are tangential to the time spent meditating have you experienced? Like, are you just calmer for a few hours afterwards, or do you realize, or do you extract some of that insight you gain in the meditative state and bring that into your daily awareness? I'm really curious about that from people's first-person perspectives.

**Speaker C:** For me personally, I used to meditate because of the suffering, just the suffering, and then it transitioned into like insight and getting like a lot of insight. I feel like there's like a little pendulum that swings back and forth. So we tend to go over the same things until we can connect the dots. And usually the meditation tends to be that little isolation practice that we can see ourselves very clearly without the noise of the world. So that is very needed in the beginning. But as you progress, you can see the meditation in everyday tasks, especially in relationships to other people, because that's when we need it the most. Is dealing with the world. So meditation, as for me, I rarely sit down. I'll have like my little relaxing breaks if I'm like on a lunch break or if I'm just waking up. I'll use that time wisely and set myself like just see what's going on, just investigate. Am I satisfied? I'm satisfied. I don't really need to get myself into meditative state because I'm already there. But if I'm not, then maybe I will put a bit more effort, like take a breath, relax, see what's there. That's at least my personal experience. I think I had these periods previously where I lay off, like sitting on a pillow for a long time, and then I go back when I really enjoy it, but not out of suffering anymore, where I'm like super suffering and I just go meditate for hours and hours just thinking that's going to help me too. Avoid the responsibility of taking the Dukkha out right now, right here. What about you?

**Speaker B:** I'm actually very inexperienced when it comes to meditating. I mean, I've had sort of a minor interest in mindfulness and Buddhism probably for the past like 4 or 5 years, and I've had a lifelong interest in Eastern religions. And spiritual practices in general. But only recently, probably in the past, say, couple months, have I tried to start actually sitting and reading and getting into stuff. And I've realized pretty quickly that not that I need like specific assistance in order to get it done, because really you're just sitting, you're breathing, you're experiencing like anybody else, right? But I've noticed that a lot of assistance comes from people who have already done the work and are able to speak about it, consider your thoughts, and sort of bounce back and forth with you.

**Speaker C:** Have you had a call with Dhammarato?

**Speaker B:** No, I have not.

**Speaker C:** I think that's worth giving a shot in the beginning because he can really nail you down the practice that we tend to practice, at least in this group. We still do a lot of different I'm sure a lot of people do a lot of different types of meditations, but mainly most of us practice like Anapanasati because we found that, at least I found, I cannot speak for everyone else, but I found that it really connected all the dots from other meditations. Because as other meditations, you said, you sit down, you're experiencing, you're just observing. So that's what would be called the noting method. And over time, at the beginning, as I said, that might be useful. But over time, you tend to note things that are not necessarily so useful for you, and then they tend to cling on for the rest of the day or for the rest of the months, and then you don't know how to really deal with them. And that's where like Dark Night of the Soul comes, or really, really deep depressive states come. It's just because you're observing all this new information and you don't really know how to process it. But with Anapanasati, it kind of makes it easy because it really does. It just instantaneously, you note and you know what to do with it. You know if it's wholesome. If it's not wholesome, then there's no need for it to stay. You know how to throw it out. So essentially you're practicing taking out the trash and keeping all the goodness.

**Speaker B:** I see, makes sense. I mean, when you meditate, you act while also experiencing like the conscious states that you're stuck in at that moment, or lucky to be in depending on your perspective, you act sort of as like a momentary filter, right? Like what you just said with taking out the trash. But I thought one of the important things about the noting style meditations was to note the impermanence and cessation of these individual thoughts, right? So if you're noting and they're cessating, what's the What's the problem with them staying, or like, how do they stay, I should say?

**Speaker C:** The clinging can come on to some deeper suffering. For example, like, there is some things we might not notice that, like, for example, you mentioned boredom. So sometimes we will not notice that boredom, and that boredom will bring certain actions that will create a lot of suffering. Like, maybe you will go out and, like, I don't know, spend all your money on, like, on the groceries, on things that you really didn't want to buy. Or maybe you will just be agitated and, like, mindlessly scroll through the internet for hours and hours. There's nothing wrong with that, but we're trying to notice these things and throw them out without actually causing ourselves harm. And as you said, noting, that is correct, because originally when you note something, you see the impermanence of it and you see that there's no point clinging to it anyway because it's gonna pass, right? Even if it's an unwholesome thing or a wholesome thing, it's gonna pass either way. But it tends to be harder to do. I used to think that was the noting method, but over time the Dukkha kind of built up and it was harder and harder to see things of impermanence, especially if you build up identity around spiritual practices. And if you read into other people's teachings and the Dark Night of the Soul is a must, everybody goes through this, you have to suffer, you have to really work really hard. Then you buy into that identity and it becomes really hard to let go. And that's how we start generating a lot more Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Isn't that kind of ironic? People going into spirituality, finding themselves a new identity rather than just getting rid of the first one, you know?

**Speaker C:** Yes, yes, replacing a suit.

**Speaker B:** I thought that one of the main points of spiritual practice was just to sort of throw off the robes and realize that the internal is empty, you know. And I'm not even like a seasoned meditator or reader or Sutta instructor or anything like that. And a lot of these things just seem kind of like obvious to understand, but almost impossible to actually operate, you know. Like, they make sense on the face value, but when you start looking in and trying to see the intentions and the experiences of the people who have been through these things they're pretty not only transformative, but kind of radical compared to the way that the rest of humans operate, you know, or rest of us, I should say.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, and I believe operating out of like seeing of like no self can bring a lot of like initial shock for somebody who hasn't built up to it because it can leave like, oh, so anything I do doesn't matter. Like I can just go go and like do whatever I want, or I can get into a depressive state and not want to get out of the bed because, hey, I don't really have to meditate. I already don't exist, you know.

**Speaker B:** I always thought that no self meant that at the core there was nothing like it. In, you know how there's an ellipsis that's three dots? Well, imagine four dots and everything's in balance, and in the center is the gap, right, where there's just nothing there. So even if your core is empty, that doesn't mean your edges stop hurting. You know, you're still just as incarnate as anybody else, you know. But what we realize when— at least this is what I've been trying to do more and more every day— is when we realize that it's empty at our core, nothing can get to you truly. But that bravery of being able to say that versus the bravery of jumping into the lion's mouth is leagues apart, but I really don't know how to get there. Maybe it's not, but I don't know.

**Speaker D:** Well, and it's also like the remembering aspect, right, of that. So there can be these insights into the nature of self or what have you, even impermanence, but then, you know, one forgets. So this is why the Sati, the mindfulness, is so essential because that's the remembering, and that's remembering to pay attention to what's going on here and now. But with that is remembering this method, right? And remembering, you know, all that, that's kind of come by me. But also, that's just paying attention to what's going on in reality as it is. Like, it's just, oh wait, things are changing, you know? And you can't spot a self, like essence, which is permanent. Like, where does this actually come from? It's all, you know, interbeing. It's all interdependent on the other sort of chains, like the object and, you know, what's seeing the object. They inter-are, right? They interconnect and all that stuff. But yeah, it's the remembering. It's the— can you remember this, you know, when you're in the middle of work, you know, if you have an angry customer You know, can you remember that? So, you know, is that Sati there for you? And that's why objects like, you know, training with the breath, and that's very much it. It is a training, right? It's developing these skills of being able to remember. And that's why the breath is so great. It's just like, oh, okay, we have a hit of Sati, you know, on the in-breath and on the out-breath, and we remember. But also too, I think what Thinking about the Anapanasati and just what meditation, I think, you know, has been so beneficial for me too, is the mental sort of stability. It is that mental stability. It is that clarity. And it is also just a joy. Oh, welcome, Rick.

**Speaker E:** Hi.

**Speaker D:** Hi. Yeah, we're just talking to Caleb here about some of the benefits of Anapanasati and all that. But, but yeah, yeah, it is, it is a way to tap into a very reliable satisfaction, a very reliable sense of joy and ease. Like, that's kind of the beauty of it as well. So, and it, and part of that is with the Anapanasati, it really is like the whole package of cultivating these skills, cultivating the feeling of success, cultivating the feeling of satisfaction and relaxation, the ability to relax the body and the mind. And yeah, really, really walk— like, talk yourself into feeling good. So part of, part of the practice is actually playing around a bit in the start with the verbal thoughts. So actually playing a bit with the verbal thoughts can be quite helpful because it does help to I think, keep one sort of grounded as well. So often we get ahead of ourselves and we're like, oh yeah, we want to drop away all the verbal thoughts. We just want to hit it. We want to get into that second Jhana or whatever, if you're familiar with that. You know, that's the thing. But actually just sticking with like the first sort of Jhana, which are you familiar with the Jhana?

**Speaker B:** I have read up a little bit about the Jhanas factors or Jhana states. I understand that it goes sort of from a feeling of like equanimity all the way up to the formless realms, but I don't really know how those experiences are.

**Speaker D:** Okay, yeah, so for this, like, the primary thing is that the first one it's good enough. Okay, so this is what happens is a lot of the time folks will be like, oh man, we got to jump all the way to formless realms. Well, how could you expect yourself to get there?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so I mean, I had an experience once where, excuse me if this is sort of brusque or too much to say, I used to be a user of psychedelics back in my college and high school years, and I once took a dose and completely disintegrated. Just, just everything was gone. I was in my bed. I knew I was at home in my bed, but the only thing in my awareness was just me. So no eyes, no ears, no mouth, no nose, no mind even, almost like this was a mind under the mind. And it was freaky because I didn't even know that was possible. And I talked to some people about it and they were supposedly longstanding and practiced Buddhists. And they say that it's like a Maya version of Nirvana itself, like some sort of illusion that says, hey, you're here. But for me, it was genuinely a positive thing that opened me up to new spiritual horizons because it showed me, hey, it's not just the meat box. You know, you also have that little flame in here to work with.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, no, that's cool. Like, I mean, that's the thing, right? It's like, okay, cool. The thing though still is, I think what is helpful for a helpful reminder is just to not get caught up in any particular experience and come back to what's going on here and now. And in terms too of satisfaction, right? In terms of— Oh yeah, it didn't.

**Speaker B:** Like make me happy or anything. It was just weird.

**Speaker D:** Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah, exactly. It's just, it's a cool thing. But what I was saying with the Jhana, or like the first Jhana, is actually it's helpful that you have some parameters and kind of what we're talking about here. And so there are some ingredients. And so this is primarily the removal of the hindrances, right? So when the mind is clear from the hindrances, which is like you know, anger, craving, or, you know, craving, desire— sorry, anger, craving. Yeah, greed, greed, greed.

**Speaker B:** I always thought there were 8, but now I'm seeing one that says it's number 9 called cessation.

**Speaker D:** Well, yeah, I mean, primarily, yeah, we're just kind of concerned with the 4, just.

**Speaker B:** I'm sorry, that was a little bit off base. Let's keep it to delightful sensations for now.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, so anyway, I was just going over the hindrances, the different ones, but primarily it's the unwholesome thoughts. You know, you're in craving, you're in a sense of lack, right? It's unwhole because it's like, okay, I need something. I'm not, you know, satisfied right now. So it's coming back to a state of like Okay, whole, complete with just the breath, like just this breath is enough, right? You don't want anything. There isn't that craving. Or sometimes like, again, another hindrance as I was going through them could be drowsiness, right? And so that would be like, oh man, I really need to go to sleep. Or there's that sort of, you know, that thing of like, I'm really tired. I can't do this. I can't practice the meditation right now. Right? So that could be a hindrance to the meditation. Or restlessness, going this way or that way and not being able to really just come back and relax with the breath and enjoy that. Or doubt. Doubt's a big one, right? So this can't work. I can't be, you know, happy with just this breath. You know, this isn't the correct practice. I'm not doing this right. I'm terrible at meditation, right? And so whenever these things are spotted, again, it's coming back and just spotting them and being you know, congratulatory with them and being like, yeah, this is fire, and really cultivating that ability to be like, yes, I've won the Super Bowl. Because again, part of this is understanding, yes, this is partially perception. This is partially made up. We can feel as good as we want to if we train ourselves to. And so we can feel like, yeah, this is better than winning the Super Bowl. This is like being able to change our mind, being able to spot these hindrances. This is all the way, and this is the cultivation of Piti, right? And so Piti, which is this feeling of success, this feeling of confidence, is actually one of the Jhana factors. So for the first Jhana, Piti is one of the elements. So we've covered a couple of them here. One of them is the removal of the hindrances, and then there's the Piti. And once again, the removal of the hindrances— when the hindrances come up, because what can happen is it can be like, oh man, we finally got into a good state, this is wonderful. And then a hindrance comes up and it's like, oh no, I'm out of my good state. No, the thing is, is to turn them against themselves. Now those are like little candies. It's like, oh yes, we spot a hindrance. Awesome. Right back on the train. Right. So it's not even like you ever fell off the horse. You just keep on riding this thing. Then, right, with that is also that feeling of satisfaction. So this is the Sukkha. This is another Jhana factor. And this is the feeling of satisfaction, which comes again from this is enough. This is contentment. This is good. We're satisfied, right? And at ease and secure and like, yeah. Oh yeah, did you?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I had something to add real quick. Would it suffice to say that it's not that we are getting off the horse when we meditate? It's more so that when we meditate, we realize we never get off the horse unless we learn to calm ourselves down. And sort of untie ourselves from the harness, if that makes sense. Yeah, I mean, I've realized that even in states of sleep, you're still there, you know. But it's almost like the main— at least what I've been seeing in my journeys through Dharma has been the the right concentration and right mindfulness, I guess. I don't know if that's right, the right way to say it. Um, it's almost like you have to center yourself in order to actually get anywhere in the first place.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I mean, it's, it's returning, I suppose, to the mindfulness, right? And that being remembering to pay attention to what's going on here.

**Speaker B:** I'm not saying you can't be like not mindful, but it's almost to say that your mind will still always have, even in states of unconsciousness, to an extent there will still be phenomena there. It's just that it's up upon ourselves whether or not we allow that in or recognize it. I've had certain experiences where I have gone to sleep but not fully gone to sleep, where it was almost like that void that I was talking about before, where you are awake while also dormant. But I don't know if that's something that is cultivated at all in these practices, like just being aware 24/7, if that makes sense.

**Speaker D:** Well, yeah, and this is the thing, right, is it's not about being aware 24/7 because that is a concept. Right. It is about being aware when we remember here and now, because often the problem is, is that we get into mindfulness, we get into meditation, and then we want to do meditation all the time. And that is a form of craving, right? Rather than just being content with when it happens here and now. And so we train ourselves to remember. It's like, oh man, I remembered right now. This is wonderful. And what this does is actually also enforce a bit more of a positive sort of feedback loop. So we're not beating ourselves up because we set ourselves a standard of you should be meditating. Like, this is a rule, you need to meditate and you need to remember to be mindful. It's like, no, I remember to be mindful. Isn't this wonderful? I can just be happy right now. And like, that's sort of the thing of bringing it back to that, you know, and having it be easy. I mean, the other thing too, and part of being able to, I think, sustain and come back to a very reliable, you know, sense of success, of ease, of comfort, is, um, yeah, throwing out some of those expectations and being satisfied with what's going on here and now, right? So like, that's, that's really it. So having, again, like, uh, attaching to any particular past experience or wanting a future experience can diminish the experience that is happening in this present moment. And so that's part of it, right? I mean, it comes back a lot of it, if you— to— I don't know, are you familiar with the Four Noble Truths?

**Speaker B:** Uh, yes, yes.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, so I mean, it primarily comes back to, you know, that, um, you know, there is the Dukkha, there's the dissatisfaction, that we— there's the cause, right? And the cause is the craving, right? The cause is that, and it makes sense. Can you be thirsty and satisfied at the exact same time? And I mean, you might be able to shift really quickly between these two, but you're not going to be thirsty, you know, and quenched at the same time, right? It's going to shift. So we're learning how to be quenched here, how to be reliably quenched. So like, that's sort of the thing with that. So it's really looking into those Four Noble Truths, and I covered, you know, the first two there, but then there is the cessation, right, of the Dukkha, right? And that's it, coming back to being quenched, coming back to being, you know, satisfied. And that's the thing too, is I think often it is seen as this long, drawn-out thing. Again, getting to the Fourth Noble Truth here, the path, which here I think we like to refer to it a bit more sometimes as a method, that this isn't a long, arduous path that we need to travel, but it is something, this method to come back to this satisfaction, to this ease, to this comfort. Right now. So that can be a very helpful thing as well. So it's realizing that Third Noble Truth over and over and over again. That's part of the training as well. And again, it's shortened down to like, what did the Buddha teach? And it's Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. So that's like a very helpful compass, because it can often be that we get really far out there on conceptual things, even when it comes to understanding of say non-self and anatta and all that stuff. But it's coming back to like, okay, what is the practical implication of this? And the practical implication is, yeah, when you can eradicate the dukkha, when you can see what dukkha is, when you can understand dissatisfaction and you know its end, it's like, okay, yeah, no, this is some good stuff. You know, not to cling to it, just to be like, wow, this is easy, this is breezy. Yeah, yeah, so that's a wonderful compass to return to.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that was excellent, DJ. I really like when you got into Jhana as far as like we're trying to really explain as riding the horse. It is mindfulness, but it's maintaining that mindfulness into a state of complete relaxation of not even needing mindfulness at a certain point. We were just so satisfied that there's nothing going on and we don't really have to pay attention to anything. It's just super pleasant and enjoyable. And that's what we're practicing here, is just to enjoy our lives, to be happy. And I think that's the most important. Everything else just falls apart. Even if you look at any of your own experiences, or I looked at my own experiences, eventually you see there's nothing to them. They come, they pass, and that's it. They arise and they disappear in the impermanence of the things, as you mentioned, even with experiences, even with states, even with everything.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, exactly. Like, they're not reliable. So where can we find this reliable satisfaction, right? It's not going to be found in these external, like, objects which arise and cease, but we can find it right here and right now if we remember.

**Speaker B:** Are you saying that it's an internal object of some sort, or is it like beyond internal or external, I guess?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I would say beyond internal or, you know, external, but yet containing both, you know. That might be a little bit more on the philosophical aspect of it, you know, even it's just, it is what it is.

**Speaker B:** For sure, for sure. Yeah, I used to be more of a philosophical type person, but really what I was doing was searching for that empirical experience of Piti, I guess, at this point. And once I started meditating even a little bit and experiencing pleasant sensations from that, that really opened up my eyes to the possibilities of not only self-control, self-awareness, but self-appreciation that's not cherishing or self-desire, you know, something that's like non-attached but still very much beneficial.

**Speaker C:** I think you'll get a good kick out of talking to Dhammarato for sure.

**Speaker B:** Oh, he's probably just going to shred apart anything that I say usually because it's not even from a negative perspective. It's just what he's going to say is going to transcend it to the point where what I was saying is almost like deprecated immediately. But that's what I want, not what I would be defensive against, you know. Like, I'm looking for the mud to be washed off my eyes, not like—.

**Speaker E:** You know what, it's a good idea not to go in with any expectations. Yes, that's the best advice anyone can give you when you're trying to talk with someone like that, because yeah, it's really just best to just be very honest and very receptive. That's it. That's it. And beyond that, you'll— yeah, it'll be a great time. But yeah, don't sweat the expectations.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I just know that at least the way where I try to explain things about my experiences, I'll use very specific and kind of verbiage words in a way that might come off as philosophical, but what I'm trying to say is very simple, you know.

**Speaker C:** There'll be a mutual understanding in that usually. I think that's That's the benefit I got out of my first call, I think, is just connecting the language, especially as we're using these ancient languages which describe certain states. And even nowadays, the Western world, which are using the mindfulness, we're using a lot of, I think, false language that have really strong terms like Nirvana, etc., etc. That we don't really understand that well. And when you meet someone who been there, done that, who studied all these words and can pinpoint you to a way in a concept you can conceptualize yourself into what it means for you, it's been very useful. Quiet.

**Speaker E:** That's nice too, right?

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, quiet's awesome. Sorry, I just had to do a bio break.

**Speaker C:** I was talking to my friend about like the quiet pauses, like when you have a conversation with somebody and most people like just blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, without taking a break to really, like, navigate themselves in talking to someone. And the uncomfortable pause comes only after like 3 seconds. If you pause like I paused right now, then discomfort comes in. But if I pause just for a couple seconds, it's completely normal. And you can give yourself so much space in these moments to take a breath, to relax, to really be there in a conversation. But we tend to miss it so many times. We tend not to be there and just yabble, yabble, yabble, thinking that somebody else is going to feel uncomfortable. And even if they do, it doesn't matter. But even if it exists as a rule, we know that it's probably like 2 to 3 seconds until that person thinks, oh wait, what's happening? I find that quite interesting.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, it's a fun object to play with, like just noticing it and being like, yeah, we don't have to listen to that discomfort. We can just be comfortable. We can come back to that.

**Speaker B:** So when people talk about insight, does that usually entail an experience of some sort of object in the mind or space around you that— like, how does that work? Is it like an opening or the acquisition of a new idea or some sort of novel experience?

**Speaker C:** It's like connecting the dots. Okay, I would say like we were talking like before, like Alex was sharing something, you participated while Alex was sharing about his relationship and etc., and he was taking a break and he was having all this insight, seeing himself in a different light. So that you can almost use that language, you're seeing something that was not there before. It was there before, but you were not seeing it. You brought it to light. And how you brought it to light is by your practice, is by being relaxed and calm and actually looking at things as they are. And once the mind is ready, we call that, I think we call that mind is ready for work, fit for work. And mind is only ready and fit for work when it's relaxed and when it's calm and we can actually look at things as they are, not with like perceptions or concepts or anything like that, but really, really sharp and relaxed.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, so this is kind of where I suppose a little bit of the difference from like the noting technique comes in, is that this practice of Anapanasati is much more— well, the noting might be referred to as a dry insight kind of practice. We're doing a little bit more of a wet insight, as in we're going to get quenched first, we're going to get satisfied. Yeah.

**Speaker E:** And then, then we start insights.

**Speaker D:** But then it's like, okay, yeah, the mind's fit for work, you know. And we got this wonderful water park we can play in.

**Speaker B:** So, you know, so how would you describe the differences between Anapanasati and, say, a more, I guess, well-known version of meditation like Vipassana? Because Vipassana is an insight meditation, right? But what I'm getting from Anapanasati, it seems to be more of just Just keeping it almost bare bones, just like the simple noting of the breath and the other mental phenomena. I really don't know.

**Speaker C:** I think the distinction would be to distinguish like what we said, like dry insight and then not so dry insight, wet insight.

**Speaker B:** Would that dryness and wetness be like emotional content? Then?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, partially, I would say, right? Is we are going to be, you know, coming from a place of success, a place of satisfaction, right? So we are going to fill up the mind with these things, for starters, you know. And that's sort of the thing. And that might calm down even further past, you know, past that. But it's still okay, we're coming from this baseline. And then from that place observing reality as it is as well. So, you know, the breath again is just an anchor, and like it is coming back, remembering to come back to partake in the practice. But then again, there can be aspects of, yeah, Vipassana, right? It is— so it's both, both Vipassana and I suppose Samatha, or whatever, the relaxing meditation. So it's actually kind of both. And they're working together. So like Vipassana is to kind of clearly see, and the Samatha is sort of to relax. So once we've kind of, you know, relaxed, we can really, you know, clear off the looking glass, and then we can see things clearly, right? And so it's from this place of satisfaction that, oh, okay, we can observe reality, we can still see, oh yeah, the breath is changing, right? They're right there, the sensations of the breath are are rising and falling.

**Speaker B:** The.

**Speaker D:** Thoughts are coming and going, you know, if there is thoughts, right? So we, and again, we are putting in right effort here as well. So that is actually bringing about, if we do have verbal thoughts, having those be wholesome verbal thoughts. So with this practice, it is very much like, oh yeah, there's nothing to do, no place to go. Dhammarato, likes that one a lot. Or if you want to go, because like I practice quite a bit of the noting, so I do kind of do a little bit of almost a note with it or a mantra. So on the in-breath, sometimes I'll just be like, breathing in, this is enough. Breathing out long, this is enough. So just to have that anchor, and then maybe after a while of of that, just drop it and just experience. And then if the mind starts to wander or whatever in terms of going into unwholesome. So the primary thing too is when it wanders, it's more, is it wholesome or is it unwholesome, right? So that's what we're more concerned about here than even being strongly focused on an object like the breath, right? The main thing is actually to keep it the applied and sustained on the wholesome thoughts, and the— or just like the wholesome attention, even if you will, right? And so that's going to be things that bring us back to contentment, to satisfaction, being okay with just this breath, or, you know, what's— we— with that too, we can be aware of what's going on in the body. And again, there can be playing, there can still be that investigation into what's going on. I enjoy playing quite a bit in terms of like, you know, looking into the phenomena as it arises and ceases, or yeah, just like, like that sort of stuff, noticing, you know, what even is this awareness, or, or what have you. And then, you know, picking that apart while still breathing in and breathing out and paying attention and being completely satisfied. Because if there comes a thought perhaps that's like, oh, you know, you really want to get this particular piece, or you don't have this piece of the puzzle yet, you need to get that. If that craving comes up, that's another thing to spot and to see and to let go of and let disperse, right? And just kind of float along as you change back to, oh, everything is okay. So it can be playing in quite a subtle way as well. But again, the primary thing is just to return back to the wholesome, like, like that's the the main thing. And then from there, we can practice the investigation. And once the mind is fit for work—.

**Speaker B:** I think I see what you're saying to a certain extent. I'm struggling to fully grasp what you're saying because a lot of it probably comes from being in the meditation mode, I guess. And the only way to really firmly grasp what's being said is to actually go out and do it to a certain extent.

**Speaker E:** You know, on that point about the meditation, what you're calling the meditation mode, one of the sweet things about practice, whether it's this or another method, is how it bleeds into non— like when you're not formally practicing, you're awake to your thoughts, you're awake to your reactions to things and your responses to things. So a lot of times you'll find that it's not only when you're in formal practice that you're experiencing the satisfaction or the fruits of the practice, but it can be moments throughout the day when you remember to be present, you know. And it's good not to make such a distinction. Between, okay, now I'm sitting, now I'm, you know, trying to have the, you know, experience the perfection of XYZ. But rather it's all throughout the day, you know, you're like, oh yeah, yeah, this, um, this tastes fantastic, let me, let me really, you know, experience this sensation. Or, oh, you know, um, how interesting that this, um, the thoughts that this phenomenon caused in me. And let's notice what that's doing. Let's not necessarily grab onto it, but just notice it as it arises and passes away. Again, not meditation mode. This has become like normal mode. But the meditation helps bring that about. In a very real way, and then at some point it becomes very blurred and blended, which is pretty sweet actually, because then you are more awake when you're awake.

**Speaker B:** I think I see what you're saying to a certain extent. I've noticed that in the hours preceding the meditations that I do, for a solid 3-hour Anapanasati span, I'd say I'd probably still feel that calmness unless something perturbs me or I go to sleep, you know.

**Speaker E:** But it's about noticing that. It's about noticing the perturbed state, recognizing it, and not necessarily trying to push it away, but just recognizing for what it is and that it's temporary, and being satisfied with noticing that temporary nature.

**Speaker A:** Nature.

**Speaker E:** And it's funny because as you notice it, it becomes very temporary, and then it's gone. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** I actually noticed that myself, where you don't have to really, like you said, push it away at all. As long as you sort of give it the full weight of your attention, even for a moment, and sort of accept it, then it feels like it's transferred the information to you that it needed to. Because a lot of these perceptions and unwholesome states don't accrue in your mind because there's some sort of mental negativity that's coming after you. It's because in the way that we are processing the sensory data in our mental continuum and all of the experiences around us, these are just the best means available, if that makes sense. Like, oh, if you Say if you're fighting somebody and you get scared and— oh, never mind, that's a terrible analogy. But basically what I'm trying to say is it's only negative because you feel like you can't handle it almost. Like if it's something that would be completely backbreaking to one person might be completely rejuvenating to somebody else. It all just depends on your perspective. What I've seen with a lot of experienced meditators is they almost have the ability to change their perspective as things arise, which is pretty freeing, I've seen. And that's opened up a large amount of, admittedly, desire in my own experience to start meditating and not achieving, but accepting my life to the point where I don't have to feel the need to achieve anymore. If that makes sense.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Caleb, I think like what you were pointing to just there is it's your relationship to whatever phenomena is arising, whatever thoughts or emotions that are arising, that is what is changing in the practice of meditation. And so that's what creates the difference between someone who is suffering over this backbreaking thought, and then someone who can look at this backbreaking thought and can realize that their back isn't breaking and everything's okay. And that thought is fine, even if it looks like a backbreaking thought.

**Speaker B:** Wow.

**Speaker C:** Oh, wow.

**Speaker A:** Okay, but I can somehow just let that be.

**Speaker E:** Right, because you don't identify, you know, you're not that You are not that thought. And I think what happens prior to a lot of practice or in a kind of a conditioned way is that people attach to it very quickly and then it becomes more backbreaking, mind-breaking. Instead you realize, no, I'm not that. I'm not that thought. It's just a thought. It's just a phenomenon. It's just an experience that I'm aware of at this point. And hey, it's cool. It's all cool. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** What's interesting, Rick, I don't know if you heard, but it's like, I don't know if I told you last week, but my girlfriend, I keep saying that, my previous girlfriend and I broke up last week. And so it's been about a week and a half. And one thing that I've noticed is that when the tendency to like crave her attention or crave even just like memories or reminiscing that goes on about, you know, just images flashing through the head, I basically kind of like objectify that, right, as like craving. Okay, let's relax out of that craving. Let's come back into wholesome. But what's interesting is that at some point, it was today that I started seeing that. I started seeing a craving to relax out of craving. And so when I saw that, there was this like, that, Caleb, was the backbreaking thought. It was like, wait, I want to practice well, but that's a problem. I'm craving to practice well. So at that point, I basically just was like, oh, okay, well then I gotta let that one be there too. I gotta make space for that as well and relax out of that one just as much as I'm relaxing out of these images about my previous girlfriend. And right then, then it all just ever since then, you know, it's just been like kind of even sailing, smooth sailing.

**Speaker B:** It's like even the desire for liberation is a hindrance, right?

**Speaker D:** Exactly, right?

**Speaker A:** Exactly. And you get so in touch with this paradox the more and more you come up against it and you relax out of it. You see that, you know, just doing it over and over again, you're like.

**Speaker B:** Well.

**Speaker A:** There is liberation, but it's not going to happen from wanting it. It happens from relaxing out of wanting it. Oh, okay, so I'll just keep doing that.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I— yeah, it's kind of like putting a horse in a stable front ways with blinders on, and if it can't look around and see behind, it's not going to back out. It's just not going to back out of that stable, right? But it's almost like the relaxation is when the horse finally realizes that there's no other way. And it just slowly walks backwards out, turns around, and is available to the whole environment.

**Speaker A:** That was really good. Yeah, yeah, that hit home for sure. Yeah, so it's just amazing, guys. Like, it's amazing. I'm so grateful for the Dhamma. I guess I could just say that, you know, like a year ago, if I had a breakup, man, I would be a total wreck, like just a total mess. And I've felt like a mess here and there, but the mess, the relationship with the mess is what has changed and allowed me to kind of go through this more wholesomely. I'm just like, it's amazing what I'm doing. I am living with my previous girlfriend. We still have a lease for 6 months. And we're being like friendly, we're being good friends, we're being honest with each other, you know, I mean, it's just incredible. It's incredible.

**Speaker C:** Handling like, like a lion.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Yeah, yeah. Dhammarato's voice comes into my head from time to time, like, ah, you— I can handle this.

**Speaker B:** Uh, this is like a small question I have that's probably not like big deal. But when, when Dhammarato, uh, was a monk in the Thai forest tradition under, um, I think it was Arahant Po, right? Um, did he ever get far enough in their tradition to be given like the permission from to teach from his guru or whatever that is? I think there's like a certain level where it's like if you're below that as a monk, you're not recommended to teach. But then once you hit above that, you almost have to.

**Speaker A:** I have no idea about that.

**Speaker D:** Okay, I believe that, um, I mean.

**Speaker B:** It'S not important to me, but yeah, I just was curious.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I believe that Ajahn Poh actually was the one who said to Dhammarato, like, he told him to go and teach the way he is online, like, with, like, one-on-one. Perfect. If I'm remembering correctly.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, I heard that.

**Speaker B:** I just That's pretty cool. The whole permission thing from like an association isn't really important to me, but the blessing of a guru is, just from my own spiritual perspective.

**Speaker A:** I mean, yeah, that makes sense. You have two, you know, two teachers of the Dhamma, and like one of them is supporting the other and going out to teach. Like, that just like kind of double backs what Dhammarato has learned.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and I've listened to what Dhammarato has been saying, and from my own individual level of experience, I can just vouch for what he's saying. I mean, it just all makes sense on the face of it, you know. And when it makes sense on the face of it, it's going to make even more sense when you get deep into it. It's kind of like peering over a ledge and like the Grand Canyon almost. It's like, well, the ledge is nice, but there's all that space down there. If you're ready.

**Speaker C:** I really like this analogy. I saw this Dharma dudes video, new videos, like short videos released, and I think Eric was talking to Dhammarato about how everyone is a teacher. We all have all the views at all times. We have an ordinary view and we have a noble view, and all people transition through them throughout days, months, Throughout cycles, we all have the ability to teach. It just matters, can we get ourselves relaxed into that state of being completely relaxed and seeing things how they are? And that's the benefit I kind of get from Sangha, is because we all get nice and relaxed in this chat and we all can teach each other. And in essence, if somebody needs a little reminder or somebody needs Good. Congratulations. It's truly a fascinating thing.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, that definitely, Alex, you deserve quite a bit of congratulations for handling your shit, man. Good job. Thanks, guys.

**Speaker C:** Not only that, Alex's videos are probably the most interesting amount of Dukkha I've ever seen. It like generates a lot of time. Like it's just a month and a half and you were like smashing it back and forth. Yeah, quite impressive.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, someone needs to do like a time-lapse edit of like, you know, some of like clips for like 5 minutes, 5 minutes, 5 minutes up into the present. You know, like the before and after. Out there kind of deal.

**Speaker C:** I took my photo every day for 10 years.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I took my photo every day for 1 month.

**Speaker D:** You guys are inspiring me to actually.

**Speaker A:** Go back and check the videos because like, yeah, I'd be— I probably would be surprised to look at myself.

**Speaker C:** And you miss a lot of things. You'll notice that you missed a lot of things that you were being communicated to because you were functioning out of unwholesome states in most of those videos.

**Speaker B:** For sure, for sure. So this is gonna sound kind of like a pretty basic question, but I'm just gonna ask it anyways. What would you all say the main difference is between like mindfulness and self-help? Like say somebody wants to read the suttas instead of reading Getting Off Your Butt and Being Happy for Dummies, you know?

**Speaker E:** What's the real— One's an intellectual pursuit, and it's more of a— in a way, it's almost like, it's almost ego-stroking in a way.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay.

**Speaker E:** Mindful, yeah, yeah. And mindfulness is about experiencing the present moment and not worrying about your preconceptions. So yeah, so one's an experience and the other is, okay, here's how to feel better about your ego.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** I mean, that sounds that may be oversimplifying it a bit, like an entire field of.

**Speaker B:** Books.

**Speaker E:** But yeah, that's— you know, presentations. And I don't know, but I'm not, I'm not very enamored with that. I, I think a lot of it is scammy.

**Speaker B:** Oh, for sure.

**Speaker E:** Yeah. So yeah, I don't know. I think it's— they're not even— I mean, they're, they're, you know, they're like, I don't know, they're apples and rotted apples.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. The only thing I really knew was like self-help is just somebody saying you can do it sort of emptily to everybody. Sort of like false, false claims. But the Dharma is like how to do it step by step. Like, it makes no— there's no room for interpretation, you know.

**Speaker C:** The Dharma is doing it. Yeah, sorry to interrupt, but the Dharma is actually doing it. One is conceptualizing. One can read the Dharma and actually not practice it and just say, like, recitate all these things, and one can understand Dharma and actually put it practice. That's, that's what we're actually like talking about it here, just getting your hands dirty, investigating it yourself, taking, taking responsibility in, in, in your own way.

**Speaker B:** In your own— and even in practice, one can sit for hours and hours and hours and get nowhere, you know. It's not like people sitting at, uh.

**Speaker E:** I love getting nowhere. That's not a bad thing, getting nowhere. We're already nowhere.

**Speaker D:** That sounds like quite a successful set.

**Speaker E:** I'm down with that. Let's do that. Nowhere. The goal is goal.

**Speaker B:** Reminds me of the gateless gate. Sorry, a lot of my experience with Buddhism has come from like Vajrayana and other Mahayana style texts. So I don't want to say I'm like corrupted or anything, but a lot of it is sort of intellectual, like you said.

**Speaker E:** But, uh, yeah, yeah, throw out these categories. Throw them out, man. They're just categories. They're, they're, they're, they're great to get you interested maybe into the practice, but trying to organize them and trying to, you know, put them in their little boxes and compare them and decide and all that. That's a lot of distraction. That's like channel surfing with Buddhism, you know. Again, it's, you know, for your right effort and right attitude, you know, plop yourself down and investigate it and be present, you know. Really, it's— yeah, it's just a bunch of concepts. It's all a bunch of concepts.

**Speaker D:** Dhammarato, what are your thoughts?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, for me personally, a lot of my practice has just been staying fully aware of all of my thoughts rather than just sort of ignoring them like how some people will do. Nowadays, there isn't like a single thought that enters my mind that I'm not aware of to a certain extent. Like, that's not to say I repeat every thought I have or I make a note of every thought I have, but I fully weigh my attention to it and give it its its due course, if that makes sense. I don't know if that's something that Buddhism promotes as a way of being, but it's been very helpful for me.

**Speaker C:** Only when there's Dukkha, that's what we usually do. We only wake up to it when we're unsatisfied. If everything is going breezy and we're feeling we're getting nowhere, then we're happy.

**Speaker B:** Well, I can say this. I'm a very anxious person. So the Dukkha just sort of never goes away. But I've noticed that I can sort of lessen it or cessate part of it to an extent. I mean, honestly, if I could just go sit and be very calm and full of Piti and all of those pleasurable sensations, I'd probably be doing that right now. You know, well, you can, but that's what I'm saying. And it's very exciting. It's very exciting news to know that I can. I can. It's just that part of it is not knowing if I trust myself to be able to do it, I guess. Like, if I sit there, we're like, really?

**Speaker E:** And that's one of the hindrances, right?

**Speaker B:** Doubt.

**Speaker E:** Hello, doubt. How are you? I remember you. I remember you, doubt.

**Speaker C:** And then just meeting you, I'm pretty sure you can do this. And you've done it many times. Without maybe really understanding it. But you have done it and you are there even right now. You are there. You are seeing it right now in this present moment. It's just making that choice. Am I Anagami? Am I going to entertain this or am I going to take a breath and get myself relaxed?

**Speaker D:** But yeah, yeah, that really comes back to the integration with everyday life is just whenever you remember, it's not always, but whenever you remember and come back to this breath, you can return home to this place of security and satisfaction. And maybe it will drift away again. Then you can remember again. And so it's just developing that skill of remembering this. Yeah. And I think too, when it comes to the sitting, if we're talking about like practicing in seclusion, so getting a time away where you can seclude yourself from perhaps more like distracting phenomena coming in and out, you can just sit in a quiet place or whatever for some time. That doesn't have to be actually for a long period of time. I think Dhammarato recommends, you know, just like 10-minute sets. I don't know if you're familiar with that, but yeah, just like 10 minutes.

**Speaker B:** That sounds really short.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, but multiple times throughout the day. So maybe like 4. Yeah, and also when you go to bed. So when you go— because again, the thing is meditating in different postures, right? So the lying posture, you know, you can lie on your side. This is the Lion's Pose. You can look up pictures of the Lion's Pose, actually, and this can be quite helpful for breathing.

**Speaker B:** Is that the one where they're like doing this?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah. And so when you go to bed, right, this can be a wonderful time, like 10 minutes before you go to bed, you're lying there anyway, just, you know, watch the breath, bring back some nice long breaths and just like really relax, bring in those thoughts of, yeah, I don't need to do anything right now. Everything is okay, there's no place to go, nothing to do, and just really cultivate that satisfaction and that ease and that relaxation right then. Because I mean, that's just it. It can be very helpful for rest and sleep. And then when you wake up as well, right before you get out of bed, you can practice, you know, and just get into a really wonderful state, right? And so it's practicing multiple times a day for like 10, you know, 10 minutes too. Like if you have like a lunch break or something, taking an Anapanasati break there, practice some mindfulness of breathing, right? And that breaks it up so that throughout the day, you know, you'll have these moments where you remember to come back to the breath.

**Speaker B:** Is there like an Anapanasati Sutta?

**Speaker D:** Yes, there is actually. The Anapanasati Sutta is I think you're.

**Speaker E:** Like so happy he asked this question, like, oh yes, finally, finally, I know, I know this answer.

**Speaker B:** Wait, no, this one, it's in the Mahishmakhat Nikaya 118. Isn't 118 like a holy number or something like that in India? I'm pretty sure it is 118 or.

**Speaker D:** 108, but oh, it might be 118. Yeah, but, but yeah, sorry. Yeah, it was 118. 117 is the Great Forty. So actually, those are two really good runs to read. The Great Forty goes over like the application of the Noble Eightfold Path or method and kind of like lays it out with the Sati viewing and effort and all that and how they run together in circles and bring about right attitude. And that kind of allows the other ones of the the speech, the act, sorry, the action, the livelihood, and the unification of mind. So this is another thing. If you talk to Dhammarato, okay, concentration is a no-no word, not to bring up a rule, okay? But unification of mind is how we like to think about it, because concentration can imply almost like this tense, like very strong thing. Whereas the mind is unified, the mind is working together, the mind is whole, it's not divided this way or that way. It's like, oh yes, we're watching the breath and being completely satisfied.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, is what you're saying like the concentration issue, is that because when somebody concentrates they have a direct intent to apply that concentration to an object, whereas the what you're trying to say when you say concentration is more indirect and general and sort of encompasses all of the phenomena that one's experiencing at once.

**Speaker E:** Or am I off base with that? Concentration is intense activity and your goal is to relax, right?

**Speaker B:** What I was trying to say was like you're just sort of in a meditative absorption that's like aware rather than unaware.

**Speaker C:** Absorption already means that you're not there because you're being absorbed by a state or experience. Okay, what we're talking about is, as you asked the awareness question before, I think that's what I was trying to explain. You can be absorbed in awareness or you can let it sit by itself, relaxed, not needing to cling to it or tense it up into any object or anything.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, and so we might use like pay attention to a particular object or even focus, right? But the idea here is that it's not like a strong, you know, concentrated— we need to focus on this very small point on the breath so that we enter psychedelic states, right? This is much more open. This is— we can enjoy the breath, we can enjoy the thoughts, we we can enjoy what's here and now, you know, rather than we need to have this focus. And then when the mind wanders a little bit, oh man, I'm not in that thing, I'm all upset because, you know, I'm not going to hit that Jhana. I got to sit here in the cave for the next 10 hours.

**Speaker B:** Isn't the whole point of being able to hit the Jhana by relaxing the mind rather than intensifying it?

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, precisely. And that's why like unification of mind might be a little a little bit more of a helpful pointer because the word is Samadhi as well. And so actually, I think Dhammarato brought this up, is that a Samatha is almost like, I think, like the kind of— if you go back to what the word means, right? It's like the coming together. So if you think of like a teepee, like all the poles, like coming together, that's like a Samadhi, right? That would be a Samadhi, right? So if we're thinking about like the mind, right? It's all coming sort of together, right? And so in that state, when the mind's together and unified, it's working in union. It isn't being pulled this way or that way. And that could be also, yeah, it's whole. It's not craving. There isn't this craving. There isn't the hindrances. It's just, yeah, we can just enjoy this. I keep coming back to just enjoying like this breath, but I mean, that's really you know what it is, right?

**Speaker B:** I mean, if that's the main point, if that's all that it is, and that's just the key to success, you just never let it go then.

**Speaker E:** I like Anagami. I like wigwams instead of teepees.

**Speaker B:** I was thinking personal preference, the spikes or the things all meeting in the center. I thought of that almost like the spokes on the wheel of Dharma itself.

**Speaker D:** Yeah. Yeah, well, that can be quite seen that way, right? Because it's all these path factors also coming together. The, yeah, the Sati or the mindfulness, the viewing.

**Speaker B:** I looked into the Anapanasati Sutta and it basically just said outright that right breathing, if that's the phrase I could use, you're using Anapanasati, fulfills all of.

**Speaker C:** The.

**Speaker B:** Seven Factors of Enlightenment itself. Yeah, just that sort of blew my mind to an extent. I was like, wait, so I got— I can give up all of the rest of this, just focus on this one thing, and I have the equivalent to the rest of that? Perfect. Yeah, that's all I need.

**Speaker C:** That's right, man.

**Speaker B:** It's like, I don't need to see pretty colors to feel happy, you know. I could be happy in a colorblind world.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, precisely. It does help because it's not setting up this expectation of you need to see this to have this attainment or whatever. You can come back and just be happy. Yeah, with this breath. And that's really, you know, what it's about. That phenomenon might arise and it might be cool, you know. But, you know, that's just it. It's cool.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. I mean, I have this thing where I'll meditate before going to sleep sometimes. In the lying position, just sort of doing the meditation the best way I know how, where I sort of just stay aware of the mind stream and the breath without analyzing or noting, just sort of chilling, I guess. When that happens, I can get to some pretty deep states, but they're almost like tired states or like sleepy states where I'm still awake in the mind, but the body is sort of going to shut down a little bit. And when that happens, sometimes I'll have like pictures that pop up, which kind of blew my mind because like normally when I think of images, they don't show up in my visual field at all. They're sort of ephemeral or out in the mind space somewhere above your head, you would say. But with this, this was almost like a hologram right in front of my vision. Like, it just— it showed up. It was just a still image of some old dude. He just sort of sat there, and then it just faded away. I was like, wait, am I going crazy? You know? But then I read about it, and everything is saying that it's just fine. So yeah, it's cool.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, it's kind of helpful to be able to see this stuff, but also to be able to see, okay, this is like, you know, internal vision or imagination and being able to see it as that and being able to appreciate it for what it is, you know, but not getting super caught up in it, right? Right. But that's, that's the, that's kind of the difference, eh, is, is it's the liking things. Like, it's cool to like stuff. When stuff comes up, you can appreciate it, enjoy it, have a blast with it.

**Speaker B:** I mean, there's no, there's no sustenance in it, you know?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, precisely. But the thing is, is Yeah, like if the problem comes up when there is that craving for it, when there is, and then that leads to the attachment, right? And that's, you know, I need to get this again. I need to have this over and over and over again. And it's not, it's not there. Yeah. And it's not really satisfying, right? But when you can come back and just be satisfied with what's going on here and now, that's much more reliable. And what's going on here and now is changing. Now, we do have a very reliable object to come back to, though, with what's going on here and now, and that's the breath. Yeah, and again, I mean, the other thing too is the breath is not like also some arbitrary object too, because it is very much, you know, if you don't breathe, you die, right? Like, it is life. And so that's the other wonderful thing with it. I know a really great thing to do is if you're like, if you don't enjoy the breath, you know, and Dhammarato will instruct people on this, like, you know, take a couple minutes, don't breathe for a while. That next breath, you're going to really enjoy it. So like that, that can be helpful sometimes. It's just like taking a pause on the breath and then coming back to it and being like, wow, this is really enjoyable. But I mean, that's part of it too, is actually cultivating that ability to have that, you know, pleasantness, that enjoying, right? Not immediately melting down into Upekkha or equanimity, into, you know, the neither, you know, liking or disliking or being unsure of, but rather we can play around with a little bit of this. You know, first, this is where we get our support. This is where we get that security. And then, okay, now we can melt down even more. And then we can investigate and play around. But yeah, yeah, just enjoying.

**Speaker E:** You know, speaking of playing around with the breath, you guys probably caught that article recently that Joe posted about how many times we typically breathe in a minute. Did you guys take it? Did you guys happen to maybe not read it, but follow that thread about the amount of times we typically breathe in a minute. So it really got me thinking about that, you know, and it's impossible to count your breaths in a natural state because as soon as you start counting, you automatically drop them, like you automatically start breathing slower. So it's really, really hard to do that. But so what I did was I started playing, like to teach. I started playing around with a little bit. I found this really cool app that you can get for free, and it's a little breath timer. And it's really cool. It's like a little flower. And so they call it a box breath, right? So so many seconds the flower opens, you hold, so many seconds you close it, right? And I think, wow, this is a really fun little game. That you can play just for about 5 or 10 minutes. And it's really sweet, especially if you know that you're going to be going into a situation that might trigger you or might cause a little bit of extra anxiety. This little flower, this little breath flower, is a wonderful, wonderful thing. And as soon as I started, I had to deleted all of the apps on my phone. I'm like, I don't need any more mobile apps. This is my game now. So whenever I have like an urge to play one of those mindless little games, matching or whatever, I just go, oh yeah, I've got my flower game. And so I'll play with that for like 5 minutes. And it's just fantastic. So it's another reminder of how you can play with different Techniques or strategies to enjoy the breath. So anyway, it's pretty cool.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, that's cool.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, it's my two cents. So, and it all started from that thread that Joe had posted about how many times do we breathe in a minute. So anyway, it's really— yeah, yeah, I.

**Speaker D:** I, I read a little bit of that. I don't think I read the actual article, but I read what Joe was saying about that and in terms of how many times we breathe. And I remember kind of playing around a bit with not necessarily an app, but just with the timer, just to kind of see, like, and kind of play around, like, oh, okay, how long can we make this, right? I mean, the thing is, there was part of me though where I noticed myself getting like perhaps a little bit too caught up at times with that. And so I was just like, wait a minute, no, it's just having the breath comfortable and enjoyable. You know, it doesn't have to be, you know, a particular way, but it is fun to play around with it and to actually see and time it. Oftentimes with the steps, I will do that as well, like when I'm doing walking meditation, kind of like breathe with the steps and have it be very rhythmic, and that go with the Mantra and all that. So that can be quite fun. But yeah, definitely, yeah, having the timers is interesting, but that sounds like a fun fun little game for it too.

**Speaker E:** It is, it's a game. That's what I'm saying. Like, it's a really sweet little game. It's the flower opens, you inhale, you wait, and then the flower closes and you exhale. Just again and again and again. I really like this. And of course it's got little noises and gongs and stuff. Like, this is the best game ever.

**Speaker D:** That's beautiful. Yeah, the box breathing is cool too, because it does emphasize that hold as well, right? So it's like breathing in and holding for a bit. Yeah.

**Speaker E:** And in that moment, in this, like, you can have a mind moment while you're in that middle, in the middle transition between the inhale or the exhale. It's like, see what thoughts come in at that moment. It's pretty.

**Speaker A:** Cool.

**Speaker C:** So anyway, that's my— Kind of reminds me when I first got into meditation and I went to like one of these meditation classes. At first they instruct you just to breathe and watch your breath and just enjoy the breath. But then the second part is like, hey, start looking at your thoughts. And that part initially like scared me off. I'm like, Wait, wait, wait, I was enjoying my breath. Now I have to look at all these shopping lists I create in my head, or all these like anxious thoughts.

**Speaker D:** Why?

**Speaker C:** And from that point, I never returned to any meditation classes because I was like, wow, this is— I get it how people cannot do this. It's very unenjoyable. Just the only part I really enjoyed was the breath. And from then on, I would just like lay in my bed and just breathe. That was my meditation. And I think that is the best meditation, is just breathing, which we already do. We just don't pay attention to it.

**Speaker E:** All right, gents, I have to head out. So good to see everybody.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, it's good to see you, right? Have a great one.

**Speaker E:** Bye, guys. Have a good week. See ya. Bye. Bye-bye.

**Speaker D:** Thanks.

**Speaker C:** Bye-bye. How about you, Robert? Anything to report?

**Speaker D:** No, life's good.

**Speaker C:** Nice, that's really good. Anyhow, guys, I'm gonna shoot out as well. It was a pleasure.

**Speaker D:** As always, yeah, it's wonderful to see you again, Carl.

**Speaker C:** Some excellent points, very nice.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, guys, thanks, Carl.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk centers on **Speaker A (Alex)** sharing his recent experience of a breakup and using the Dhamma to navigate the resulting mental and emotional challenges. The conversation evolves into a broader discussion on meditation practice, particularly **Ānāpānasati** (mindfulness of breathing), and how to integrate mindfulness into daily life and relationships.

Here is a structured summary of the key themes and insights:

### **1. Alex's Situation & Primary Question**
*   **Context:** Alex has broken up with his girlfriend but they still live together. Old mental patterns (craving for her attention, jealousy) continue to arise.
*   **His Practice:** He has been rigorously applying mindfulness: noticing unwholesome thoughts (craving, jealousy), relaxing out of them, and returning to a wholesome, peaceful state.
*   **Key Insight:** He discovered a meta-problem: **craving to not have cravings.** He realized he had to make space for *all* thoughts without struggle, finding that peace could remain even with difficult thoughts present.
*   **New View:** With space, he sees that many relationship problems stemmed from his own "stuff" (projections, insecurities). This is allowing a "new view" of his ex-partner to emerge, less filtered by his own reactions.
*   **Core Dilemma:** How does he know if his renewed interest in her comes from a place of **cool peace and clarity** or from the same old **attachment and desire**? How can he trust this "new view"?

### **2. Sangha's Advice on Relationships & Practice**
The group offers advice grounded in mindful investigation:
*   **Investigate, Don't Decide:** Approach the situation with ongoing investigation rather than solid expectations. Both people are subject to change.
*   **Friendship as a Foundation:** Focus on building a healthy friendship with clear boundaries and space, which is currently proving beneficial.
*   **The Real Test:** The true test of insight is **applying it in relationship**. Can he maintain his "new view" and inner peace while interacting with her, listening to her complaints, etc.? Practice in isolation is easier; the Dhamma is proven in dynamic interaction.
*   **Use the Situation as Practice:** The relationship becomes the perfect ground to "play with" and apply the tools (noticing craving, relaxing) he has been developing.

### **3. Broader Discussion on Meditation (Ānāpānasati)**
When **Speaker B (Caleb)** joins and asks about meditation, the focus shifts to practical instruction:
*   **Awareness & Object:** Awareness is like a spotlight. In Ānāpānasati, the breath is the primary anchor, but awareness can fluidly move to investigate thoughts or body tension as needed. The goal is not rigid focus, but a relaxed, playful abiding.
*   **Wholesome vs. Unwholesome:** The core practice is discerning wholesome from unwholesome thoughts. The effort is to sustain the wholesome (contentment, ease) and relax out of the unwholesome (craving, doubt, restlessness).
*   **The "Wet Insight" Approach:** This method is contrasted with "dry insight." Here, one **first cultivates satisfaction and pleasure** (*pīti*, *sukha*) through the breath. A mind that is "fit for work"—calm, satisfied, and unified—then naturally gains clear insight (*vipassanā*).
*   **Jhāna as Unification:** The first *jhāna* is framed not as a trance, but as a **unified mind** free from hindrances, characterized by success (*pīti*), satisfaction (*sukha*), and one-pointedness. It's achieved through relaxation, not forceful concentration.
*   **Integration into Daily Life:** The practice is meant to bleed into everyday life. Short, frequent "sets" (even 10 minutes) throughout the day—upon waking, on breaks, before sleep—are recommended. The aim is to make remembering to return to peaceful awareness a habitual part of life.

### **4. Key Takeaways & Principles**
*   **The Central Paradox:** The desire for liberation (or to be rid of cravings) can itself become a craving. The path involves relaxing out of *that* too.
*   **Relaxation is the Method:** The fundamental attitude is one of relaxing the body and mind, relaxing out of unwholesome states, and returning to the wholesome ease of the breath.
*   **Satisfaction is the Foundation:** Cultivating a reliable, internal sense of "this is enough" with the present moment (the breath) is the cornerstone of the practice and the antidote to craving.
*   **Practice in the World:** While seclusion is useful, the Dhamma is ultimately about relating to the world and others with wisdom and peace. Relationships are a prime field for practice.
*   **No-Self in Practice:** Insights into not-self (*anattā*) are practical: you are not your thoughts. You can have a "backbreaking thought" and see that your back isn't broken. This change in **relationship to phenomena** is the essence of freedom.

**In essence, the talk moves from a personal story of heartbreak to a living demonstration of how the Dhamma provides a practical toolkit: using mindfulness of breathing to build a foundation of inner peace, and then using the challenges of daily life (like a complex breakup) as the arena to develop wisdom, clarity, and genuine freedom.**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here is a breakdown of the key metaphors and stories used by the speakers:

### **Primary Metaphors & Analogies**

**1. The "Old View" vs. "New View" (Speaker A)**
*   **Metaphor:** Describes the shift in perception of his former partner. The "old view" is clouded by his own projections, cravings, and insecurities. The "new view" emerges as he makes peace with his own "unwholesome aspects," allowing him to potentially see her more clearly and purely.
*   **Purpose:** To frame his central dilemma: How to trust which view is accurate and wholesome when considering reconciliation.

**2. Meditation as "Taking Out the Trash" (Speaker C)**
*   **Metaphor:** Compares the Anapanasati practice to discarding unwholesome thoughts (the trash) and keeping wholesome ones. This contrasts with "noting" meditation, where one might observe but not necessarily filter or remove mental clutter.
*   **Purpose:** To explain the active, cleansing aspect of their preferred meditation practice.

**3. The Mind as a Horse & Meditation as Riding (Various)**
*   **Metaphor:** Introduced by Speaker B ("putting a horse in a stable... it just slowly walks backwards out"). It's expanded by others to mean that in meditation, you don't "fall off the horse" when a hindrance arises; you learn to spot it and keep riding. Mindfulness is the act of staying on the horse.
*   **Purpose:** To describe the continuous, non-judgmental process of maintaining awareness and returning to a wholesome state.

**4. Practice in Isolation vs. Relationship as a Test (Speaker C)**
*   **Story/Analogy:** Speaker C responds to Speaker A's situation by comparing self-practice to practicing in a clean, quiet room (isolation). The real test is applying that calm and clarity in the noisy, challenging "world" of a relationship.
*   **Purpose:** To suggest that Speaker A will only know if his "new view" is stable by carefully re-engaging in the relationship while trying to maintain his inner peace.

**5. Dry Insight vs. Wet Insight (Speakers D & C)**
*   **Metaphor:** Contrasts two approaches to insight meditation.
    *   **Dry Insight (associated with some Vipassana/noting):** Seen as observing phenomena without first cultivating a base of satisfaction, which can be harsh or difficult.
    *   **Wet Insight (associated with their Anapanasati):** Involves first "getting quenched"—building a foundation of satisfaction, joy, and relaxation—from which investigation naturally arises.
*   **Purpose:** To differentiate their method and emphasize the importance of cultivating wholesome states as a foundation.

**6. Awareness as Water/Cup (Speaker C)**
*   **Metaphor:** Explains how awareness functions. If you need water (an object of focus), your awareness moves to the cup. If you are satisfied, awareness doesn't need to cling to any object and can just "melt into everything."
*   **Purpose:** To describe the natural, need-based movement of attention and the goal of a relaxed, non-clinging awareness.

**7. Replacing a Suit (Identity) (Speaker C)**
*   **Metaphor:** Critiques a common pitfall in spirituality where people don't shed their ego but simply replace their old identity (e.g., "businessperson") with a new one (e.g., "spiritual seeker").
*   **Purpose:** To warn against forming attachments to spiritual concepts or personas.

**8. Samadhi as a Teepee/Wigwam (Speaker D)**
*   **Metaphor:** Explains *samadhi* (often translated as concentration) not as intense focus, but as "unification of mind." Like the poles of a teepee coming together at a single point, the mind's various aspects unify into a whole, relaxed, and collected state.
*   **Purpose:** To reframe concentration away from tension and toward harmonious integration.

### **Other Notable Imagery and Phrases**

*   **"Making space" for thoughts:** Speaker A describes allowing cravings to be present without being overwhelmed by them.
*   **"Pulling the wool over my eyes":** Speaker A's worry about self-deception in his relationship.
*   **"Going upstream":** Used to describe being in a partnership with someone who is self-sabotaging, implying constant struggle.
*   **"Aha, I see you":** Suggested by Speaker D as a playful, congratulatory phrase to use when spotting a hindrance, turning it into a game.
*   **"Playing with new toys":** Speaker C encourages Speaker A to see future interactions with his ex as a chance to "play with" and apply the insights he's gained in isolation.

These metaphors and stories collectively serve to make abstract Dhamma concepts (mindfulness, insight, craving, right view) more tangible and to provide relatable frameworks for navigating personal and meditative challenges.
