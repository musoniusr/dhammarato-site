### Transcript


**Speaker A:** It's not overly deep. It's not like I'm craving for an answer, but I'm just curious. Maybe I just want to relearn some basics. First thing that comes to mind is— I'm not sure, is this a common experience? As I get— as I practice more, it almost feels like I lost a lot. I lose a lot of interest in what I think I want. And it kind of gets— Is that.

**Speaker B:** A good thing or a bad thing?

**Speaker A:** It feels scary. But at the same time it feels free. Yeah, I'm not sure, it's weird. It feels weird, it's this weird dissonance, but when I release it— Well, let.

**Speaker B:** Me ask you a question then, is that if that stuff that you're losing interest in was the old stuff that was unwholesome, is that a good or a bad thing?

**Speaker A:** It's definitely a good thing, yeah, yeah, it is a good thing. It is a good thing. It's just, well, to give you an example, it's like I have this place in mind that I want to go and visit, right? Like, okay, this is like a place I want to go, a place I want to visit, and it's like You know, I don't know, just keep meditating, like right here, right now is the best. Like nothing, nothing beats chilling out right here. It's like when I look at a place where I thought I want to go, it's like, is it really that good? Like, is it really worth?

**Speaker B:** Is it worth the effort of taking the trip to go there?

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker B:** Well, I'm glad to hear you making that kind of decision when you're young, rather than having to wait until you're old. Old, where it takes too much effort, and you know that it takes too much effort to go there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. I mean, so when I remember to, you know, just wake up, take a deep breath, when I just really absorb in this moment, I know all this just falls away. It's almost like this weird, you know, sometimes I have that, oh, I feel like I want it, and then suddenly I don't want it again. It's like, okay, it's like maybe I'm just not used to it, I guess. It's, I don't know, maybe that's also an unwholesome thought, right? Thinking about why is it this way, it's also unwholesome. I'm just questioning. Questioning.

**Speaker B:** As you probably know, I did a lot of traveling in the 1970s and '80s.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So, there's— and the reason for a lot of traveling was that I was looking for something. I didn't even know what it was that I was looking for, but I was looking for something. So that's the next kind of question to ask you is, is that what are you looking for? Then in fact you could even go so far as tell me what kind of places are you thinking about going to visit?

**Speaker A:** Well, I always had a fascination with Japan. I had this like, "Oh, it's really beautiful." But the interesting thing was, I don't know, like, I feel like I've been meditating so much and I just took a stroll around my neighborhood, around the places I'm already at. It's like, whoa, this place is really beautiful. Like, and then it creates this weird dissonance, like, okay, what makes this place less attractive than the place I think I want to go? Like, it's almost like, like, right? I mean, you said this a lot, like, right now this is paradise. So, it was like, I scratching my head.

**Speaker B:** What do you think about this question then? Is the Japan in your mind better than the Japan that you know that's real?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's the thing. I really, that's what I question. It's like, that image I have in my head, plus what is really there, it's like, I can see that, because I'm reflecting on how many times this really happened. I've been to some other country, like Indonesia, Taiwan, it's like, when I'm there, it's like, I mean it's nice but, it's hard to imagine that's any better than where I'm at. I mean, when I remember the wake up that is, I'm not sure it was. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Well, here's then, um, these, these are the kind of questions then I would ask in that regard to get you to, um, to examine things. Are you going to Japan because of the mountains in Japan? Because there are mountains in Malaysia.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Are you going to go to Japan because of the cities in Japan? Because the cities in Japan are nothing like people would hope that they would be.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Are you looking for Zendo in Japan? Because there are Zendo in Malaysia that probably would be more welcoming and you'd get just as much out of as if you went to Japan.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so now I'll go back and ask the original question then. What do you want? By going to Japan.

**Speaker A:** I feel like it's just this deep yearning for connection. And of course, the Zen was definitely something I had in mind. But it's really funny because then, yeah, like you said, why do I have to go so far? Like, I know there's temples here. Like, like Katal told me, he said there's this really good a temple in West Malaysia that I can visit and practice in. So, it really puts things into perspective, like, what kind of story am I telling myself?

**Speaker B:** Like— I mean— You also know the difference between a Zendo that you'd visit one day, and a Zendo that you move into and live.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, yes.

**Speaker B:** And often the imagination is the Zendo that you would move into and live, and in fact the reality is, it's the Zendo that you go to visit.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true. I was thinking of all these visiting. It's not— yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so with the examination then of these kind of thoughts, you can also come to the point of understanding that what you're looking for, you can find right there in the room you're in.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Which is joy, contentment, peace, and happiness and all of that. And probably traveling is not going to bring you that, and being in Japan is probably not going to bring you that, and moving into a Zendo may be pretty hard on you. So you can take it easy right where you are and get all the benefit out of it that you'd spend by doing a lot of traveling and sitting in a Zendo.

**Speaker A:** I'm— I— yeah, so that kind of brings me to a— I was just trying to— what about— no, what about like if I have the thought of like going to Thailand, right? Like staying in the temple there.

**Speaker B:** Uh, that's a much easier trip in several different dimensions. For instance, you can hop on a train. I don't know where you are, but they've got trains in Malaysia down to Butterworth. How far are you from Butterworth?

**Speaker A:** Um, I'm basically at the east, so, uh, it's not that far. There's 2 hours plane trip to Butterworth and That's it, right?

**Speaker B:** And then the train to Surat Thani is probably 4 hours. Now you're in my neighborhood if you're in Surat Thani. And here we have all kinds of things. We've got Wat Soen Mokkh. We got Deepa Bhavana. We've got the International Dhamma Hermitage. It's just 20 kilometers from Surat Thani, and then a boat ride can get you to Deepa Bhavana on Wat Suwan Mokkhun. We've got 3 or 4 wats that you can hang out here on this island. Japan, I'm not sure of where to tell you to go or how to get there, but I do know that it's going to be one tough journey. Even after you arrive in Japan, it's going to be a tough journey.

**Speaker A:** So if you're thinking about taking the.

**Speaker B:** Journey, you might find that in fact Kuala Lumpur has a Thai temple there. And I have— though the information that I have is 25 years old. The information that I have is that that Thai temple is good. They know Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and all that kind of stuff. So that's only a, what, a 2-hour train ride in the other direction. And then there's that room that you're in that doesn't take any train rides at all, and you can just sit there and say, hot dog, I'm all right already. But it may be valuable for you to come and stay at a wat here. You're most welcome. Much easier journey than to Japan. I know, I have been to Japan. It's tough, it's tough, and it's expensive.

**Speaker A:** Yes. No, yeah, that's really true. I'm surprised how simple this is. Yeah. Definitely, I have a change of heart in how I see things. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's been 40 years since I joined Japan, and it's just as tough and just as expensive now as it was then. But if you're thinking about coming to Thailand Come right on.

**Speaker A:** You always try to remind us that we have options in how we see things. I was wondering, you know, sometimes, like, let's say if I'm feeling restless at a place, and I have a thought of, like, I want to go to a nearby forest or wherever, just to be alone. Is how should I act in that situation? Like, maybe I'm making this too complicated. It's just sometimes I'm not sure, like, well, there's nowhere to go right here, right now, it's okay. Or it's like, hey, if I want to really go, then that's okay too. So I feel like the answer is just really simple, right? I don't have to think about it, just if I want to do it, just do it. I'm not sure. I ask this because there was a week ago where I was just in my living room and I was feeling really restless. And in the end, I took the option to go for a walk. Yeah, I took an option to go for a walk. I feel better, but then I have the thought I need to go somewhere further. So Maybe, maybe it's unwholesome to even ask this question, because I'm just overanalyzing this at this point. Like, there's really nothing there, like, I can just be okay with how confusing it is. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Well, there's not much to it, is there?. It's just thinking and just thinking, and in fact you're okay right where you are.

**Speaker A:** I also forgot how simple this practice really is. Like, it's so interesting because I really have I was to say, it's interesting because I actually have a lot of questions, but then when I talk to you, suddenly the question is gone. Yes, I know.

**Speaker B:** So, do you have some time coming.

**Speaker A:** Up?

**Speaker B:** In the sense of— You mean going there? Yeah, to come to visit here in.

**Speaker A:** Thailand. I have to plan it, I think I do. Yeah, I need to organize some stuff. Get something fixed, take good care of. Renewing my passport, it shouldn't take much. Yeah. I will ask Mikey for clarification if I'm unsure how to go.

**Speaker B:** All.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** So between now and the renewal of your passport, can you just sit and be.

**Speaker A:** Happy?

**Speaker B:** Yes. Yeah, I find it's really interesting that so many find that so difficult to do. When I give basic instructions, many of them will just ask one question after another, after another, after another, when I invite them to just practice right here with me right now, and they can't do.

**Speaker A:** It.

**Speaker B:** And you were pretty slow in getting the point. The point is that there's no point to.

**Speaker A:** It.

**Speaker B:** Just enjoy yourself right where you.

**Speaker A:** Are. I was rewatching my old video, I think it was the second video I talked to you, and you keep hammering this very simple thing, like right here, right now, you say. At that point, at that time, I don't get it, you know. And now I was like, it's like, it's so profound. It's like really that simple. Like, I've been doing that a lot. It's interesting. You just keep practicing. Yeah, someday it's difficult, but most of the time I can handle.

**Speaker B:** It. Right now I hear you've been practicing, I want to go to Japan, I want to go to Japan, I'll get something really wonderful and magical if I go to Japan. And you can have something wonderful and magical by stop wanting to go to.

**Speaker A:** Japan. Yes, been practicing the wrong word my whole life. Aha. Yeah, I got it.

**Speaker B:** You got it, that's the point, right. Okay, well why don't we finish this call now, and you can go practice just being right okay right where you are.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I will. Okay, thank you. We'll see you later. See you.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato, centers on a practitioner's (Speaker A) experience of **losing interest in worldly desires** as their meditation practice deepens, and the **seemingly simple but profound insight** that peace and contentment are available right here, right now.

**Core Themes:**

1.  **The Ambivalence of Letting Go:** Speaker A describes a common stage in practice where old cravings and interests (like a strong desire to travel to Japan) fade. This feels both **liberating and unsettling** ("scary... but free"). Dhammarato guides them to see this as a positive sign—the letting go of unwholesome attachments.

2.  **"The Paradise of the Present Moment":** The central teaching is that we often seek happiness in an idealized future or distant place (e.g., a perfect Japan, a serene Zendo), while overlooking the peace available immediately. By "waking up" and absorbing the present moment—"chilling out right here"—the compulsive need for those external things falls away.

3.  **Examining the "Story" vs. Reality:** Dhammarato helps deconstruct the fantasy. He asks: Is the Japan in your mind better than the real one? Are you seeking mountains, cities, or Zen—all of which have equivalents closer to home? This reveals that the yearning is often for an **internal state** (connection, peace) mistakenly projected onto an external location.

4.  **Simplicity of the Practice:** A key realization is how **simple** the core practice is. Speaker A notes that their many questions dissolve in conversation, leaving just the instruction to "sit and be happy" where you are. The difficulty lies not in complexity, but in our resistance to stopping the search and settling into present-moment contentment.

5.  **Practical Guidance on Restlessness:** When Speaker A asks about dealing with restlessness (e.g., wanting to go to a forest), the advice is not dogmatic. The answer is simple: if you need to take a walk, do it. The problem is **overthinking and creating a dilemma** where there is none. The fundamental point is recognizing "you're okay right where you are."

**Conclusion & Outcome:**
The talk concludes with Speaker A having a "change of heart." They see through the self-created story and understand that what they are truly seeking ("joy, contentment, peace") can be found **in the room they are already in**. Dhammarato humorously contrasts the difficult journey to Japan with the ease of finding peace locally or even visiting nearby Thai monasteries, but ultimately brings the focus back to the ever-available option: to **stop wanting** and start **being present**.

**Key Quote (Encapsulating the Talk):**
*"You can have something wonderful and magical by stop wanting to go to Japan."*

The talk is a gentle, Socratic reminder that the heart of the practice is to **release the craving for a different experience** and to fully appreciate the adequacy and peace of the present moment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the dialogue, the primary **metaphor** is that of **traveling to a distant place** (specifically Japan) representing the pursuit of external fulfillment, enlightenment, or a "better" spiritual experience. This metaphor is unpacked and contrasted with the idea that what one seeks is already present "right here."

Here are the key metaphors and stories used:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **The Journey/Trip to Japan:** This is the central metaphor. It represents:
    *   The craving for something distant, exotic, or seemingly more "authentic."
    *   The belief that happiness, peace, or deeper understanding must be found somewhere else, in a specific location or institution (like a famous Zendo).
    *   The effort and struggle of seeking externally.

2.  **"Right here, right now is paradise / the best":** This is the counter-metaphor. It represents:
    *   The possibility of finding contentment and peace in the immediate, ordinary present moment and location.
    *   The simplicity of the practice, which doesn't require geographical travel.

3.  **"The Japan in your mind" vs. "the Japan that's real":** This contrast highlights the metaphor of **mental projection vs. reality**. The idealized, imagined destination is compared to the often mundane, challenging reality.

4.  **The Room You're In:** Used by Speaker B to concretize the "right here" metaphor. It symbolizes immediate, accessible peace without any need for travel.

### **Stories and Anecdotes**
1.  **Speaker B's Travels in the 70s/80s:** He briefly mentions his own history of extensive travel, framing it as a story of "looking for something." This personal story gives authority to his advice that the seeking itself may be unnecessary.

2.  **The Practical Journey to Thailand:** Speaker B contrasts the difficult, expensive trip to Japan with a simpler, step-by-step train and boat journey to temples in Thailand (like Wat Suan Mokkh). This isn't just practical advice; it's a **story about accessible paths**. It shifts the narrative from an idealized, difficult quest (Japan) to a more grounded, feasible option if one *must* travel, while still pointing back to the simplest option (staying put).

3.  **Speaker A's Past Travels to Indonesia and Taiwan:** Speaker A recalls his own experiences visiting other countries and realizing they weren't fundamentally "better" than where he was. This is a personal story that supports the metaphor—the feeling of "arrival" not matching the anticipation.

4.  **The Story of Restlessness and the Walk:** Speaker A shares a recent anecdote about feeling restless in his living room and going for a walk. This micro-story encapsulates the core dilemma on a smaller scale: the urge to "go somewhere" to fix a feeling versus the possibility of settling "right here." His analysis of this simple event shows him grappling with the same pattern as the Japan desire.

**Overall Narrative Arc:** The conversation itself tells a story. It begins with Speaker A's metaphor of longing for a distant, spiritual Japan. Through questioning and contrasting stories, Speaker B guides him to deconstruct that metaphor and embrace the simpler, more profound metaphor of finding "paradise" in the present moment. The talk concludes with Speaker A having a "change of heart" and seeing the simplicity he had forgotten, completing a mini-story of insight.
