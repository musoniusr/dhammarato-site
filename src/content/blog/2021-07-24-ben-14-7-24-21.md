### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So hang on a sec. So are you asking about the value in getting away from it all? Are you talking about the practicalities about how to do that?

**Speaker B:** I suppose, I suppose a mixture of the two, but more the value of seclusion, stepping away from work, home-related chores, social media, you name it. Just, I suppose, how to implement it, yes, but the value that one can take from maybe just a few hours a week on one day, like a weekend. Just to yourself, you know, the value of it?

**Speaker A:** Well, there are several ways of beginning to look at it. One of the ways of looking at it is that getting away from it all or seclusion actually goes against our instincts.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we're quite social creatures.

**Speaker A:** Because we are social creatures. In fact, we discussed that a long time ago when you first called, right down to fish and schooling.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I remember.

**Speaker A:** I remember. Okay, so that nesting, schooling, herding instinct is the basis for human society. And you could go so far as to say, and exploration is nothing more than pushing one's territorial boundary. But it's still the territorial instinct works hand in glove with the nesting instinct. In fact, the territorial instinct is what gives the nesting instinct its power or its foundation, and that we do it in the sense of there is us and there is the known and there is the safe and secure here. But out there, it's unknown. It's not our territory. It's not part of our nest. We don't know those people or those animals. They're different. Okay, and so that whole mentality is basically those two aspects, but out of an even deeper instinct, and that's the self-preservation instinct that is basically fear. So being afraid is our most primary deep emotion. Yeah, is fear, which means that the primary release from that is going to be feeling, uh, safe and secure to the point of freedom. Yeah, because freedom is always limited by what we can hide behind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Very well. Yeah, and if we don't need anything to hide, and if we don't need to hide behind anything, then we have much more freedom. We— in fact, you could think of freedom as just another word for exposure. And there's also another one that comes out of a song Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose. Freedom's just another word of having nothing left to lose, and therefore, because you have no baggage, you have nothing to cling to, you are now free to go.

**Speaker B:** Hmm. As you choose. Nothing weighing you down.

**Speaker A:** And so, in fact, one of the things that weighed us down by far more than anything else that we know of, that is expressed in the Pali term Sila, Bhavana, Paramita, which is our clinging, the way that the Buddha talks about it, is clinging to rights, rules, and rituals, is the same thing as us clinging to the nest. So Buddha's Sila Bhata Paramasa, which is in fact also we refer to as the parent ego state, or telling us what the rules are. This is basically what we're talking about is society. So now what we're talking about is this instinctual nesting instinct is a really, really heavy burden upon us that we don't even recognize and realize. Until we start to set it down. And this is where the seclusion comes into. So there's much, much more to it, um, at a really deep level than merely the way that I normally express it, which is in the sense that We need to get away from the outside world so that we can deal with what's left of that outside world that we did carry into seclusion, so that we now can become secluded from that too. OK, and what that means is, is that we learn to be on guard for what society would normally be telling us if we were in society. When we go into seclusion, there are that society is still yapping at us, telling us what we ought to be doing.

**Speaker B:** Hmm. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Now, this society that we're talking about is actually more closely understood and also in the sense of all of our attachments or all of our repetitive telling ourselves what the rules are, how to get along, all of that kind of stuff. Is the Sila Bhātā Paramāsā, that then when the psychologists started looking at it, Freud came up with the issue of the ego, the superego, and the id, which is the actual superego is this society, and that it's weighing down or controlling the id, which would, in let us say very primitive situations, a very primitive situation means the child grows up completely wild, So what makes us domesticated, or what makes us socialized, is the socialization process we go through, that we're not really natural inside. That if every one of us grew up like Tarzan, we would be very Tarzan-like. And there's other stories that have happened from time to time in society, but basically when a young man or a child grows up in a very primitive society or situation, they have skills of observation and perception that most people in society don't have because we've got the shackles of this is the way things should be.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I've heard quite a few stories of like wild children and stuff like that, children who have just ended up for whatever reason growing up isolated in a forest, and they behave very animal-like, you know. We are animals. Yeah, yeah. And when these kids are trying to— when these kids are— they're trying to be reintroduced to society and whatnot, they.

**Speaker A:** Can'T pick up language.

**Speaker B:** Introduce— I do apologize. When they are in trying to be introduced into society. They can't pick up language. They can't pick up and understand like technology and all sorts of stuff like that.

**Speaker A:** They're completely— In other words, once a child grows up in the society, in fact, by watching some Stanford videos on YouTube, on behavioral biology, I've come to understand how genes work that are turned on and off, not at birth or not at conception. A lot of people have the idea that the genes come together, merge mommy and daddy, then there is us at that point of conception.

**Speaker B:** Now, at some points in life, events can happen which trigger genes to be turned on or off. Which give rise to different behaviors or feelings and stuff like that.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and that's right, so a lot of stuff is learned. A lot of stuff was, um, uh, that actually we learned it in childhood, which then sets things almost in concrete, or actually in DNA. There's one of the examples that they use in this course which just really struck me strongly, because I recognized that this too has happened. And what it is, is that in World War II, at the end of the war, Germany was running out of food as the Allies were coming in, and so some of the satellite countries, including I think the Netherlands, were starved for about 3 months until when the Germans pulled out and all of the food.


### Summary

Based on this excerpt, the Dhamma talk with Dhammarato (Speaker A) and a Sangha friend (Speaker B) explores the **deep psychological and instinctual value of seclusion (withdrawal from social and worldly busyness)**.

Here is a summary of the key points:

**Core Theme:** Seclusion is not just a practical break but a profound tool to confront and dismantle the deeply ingrained social conditioning that creates inner burden and limits true freedom.

**Main Arguments:**

1.  **Seclusion Goes Against Instinct:** Human beings are social creatures with strong nesting/herding and territorial instincts rooted in self-preservation and fear. Our entire society is built upon this foundation.

2.  **The "Burden" of Socialization:** This social instinct manifests internally as a constant inner voice—compared to the Buddha's concept of *silabbata paramasa* (clinging to rules and rituals) and Freud's "superego." This voice tells us "the rules" for belonging and safety, weighing us down without us even realizing it.

3.  **Freedom Through Exposure:** True freedom is defined as having "nothing left to lose"—no baggage, nothing to hide behind, and no internal rules to cling to. It is a state of exposure and non-clinging.

4.  **The True Purpose of Seclusion:** The initial value of seclusion is to physically remove ourselves from society's demands. However, its **deeper value** is that in silence and solitude, the internalized "yapping" of society becomes audible. We can then observe, confront, and learn to set down that internal burden.

5.  **Evidence from "Wild Children":** The discussion uses the example of feral children to illustrate how socialization is a learned process that shapes our very perception. Once this conditioning is set (especially in early childhood), it becomes deeply embedded, like concrete in our psyche.

**Practical Implication:** Even a few hours of seclusion a week is valuable because it creates the space to notice the internal "rules" and social conditioning we carry. It's the first step in disentangling from that conditioning to find a more authentic, unburdened, and free state of mind.

**In essence:** Seclusion is valuable not for escape, but for **confrontation**—it allows us to see and work with the internalized society we carry within us, which is the real obstacle to freedom.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate the value and nature of seclusion:

### **Metaphors:**

1.  **The Nest / School / Herd:** This is the central metaphor. The "nesting, schooling, herding instinct" represents society, safety, rules, and our ingrained social identity. Seclusion is presented as stepping *outside* of this nest.

2.  **Territory:** Linked to the nest, the "territorial instinct" defines the known (safe, inside the nest) versus the unknown (unsafe, outside). Exploration is "pushing one's territorial boundary."

3.  **Baggage / Weight / Shackles:** Social conditioning is described as a "heavy burden," something that "weigh[s] us down," or "shackles." Seclusion is the process of "set[ting] it down" to become lighter and freer.

4.  **Freedom as Exposure:** Freedom is reframed not just as liberty, but as "just another word for exposure"—having nothing to hide behind and no "baggage" to cling to.

5.  **Domestication:** Humans in society are described as "domesticated" or "socialized," implying our natural, wild state has been tamed by social rules, similar to animals.

### **Stories and References:**

1.  **The Buddha's Teaching (Sīlabbata-parāmāsa):** The speaker references this Pali term, translated as "clinging to rites and rituals." This is equated with the "parent ego state" and the social "rules" we internalize—the very thing seclusion helps us step away from.

2.  **Freudian Psychology:** The speaker uses Freud's model of the **id, ego, and superego** to explain the conflict. The "superego" is society's voice internalized, which "weigh[s] down or control[s] the id" (our primal instincts).

3.  **"Wild Child" Stories:** Both speakers reference tales of children raised in isolation (like **Tarzan** or real "feral children"). These stories serve as extreme examples of humans *without* social conditioning, possessing different skills but unable to integrate into society's rules and language later. They illustrate how foundational and concrete early socialization is.

4.  **World War II & The Dutch Famine:** The speaker references a specific historical example (the Hongerwinter in the Netherlands) to introduce the scientific concept of **epigenetics**. The story illustrates how profound environmental events (like starvation) can "trigger genes to be turned on or off," affecting behavior and health. This parallels how early social conditioning can set patterns "almost in concrete, or actually in DNA."

5.  **Song Lyric:** The speaker quotes a line from the song "Me and Bobby McGee" (popularized by Janis Joplin): **"Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose."** This reinforces the metaphor of freedom as the release from attachments and baggage.

**In summary,** the speaker uses metaphors of **nature (nest, herd, territory)** and **constraint (baggage, shackles)** to frame society as an instinctual, weighty system. They then draw on **religious philosophy (Buddhism), psychology (Freud), fictional and real-life stories of feral children, and historical/scientific anecdotes** to argue that seclusion is a vital tool for temporarily shedding that social conditioning to find a more fundamental freedom.
