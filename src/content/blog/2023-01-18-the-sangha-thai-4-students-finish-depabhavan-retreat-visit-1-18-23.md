### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Because if I can't hear their voices, then I don't know if that's going to affect the recorder.

**Speaker B:** Well, you can hear them. You can hear them. They just can't hear you. No, I actually can't really take— I'm going to take the headphones off so that I don't hear you either.

**Speaker A:** Okay, but I can only hear you. That's the only thing I can hear. I can't hear them.

**Speaker B:** So they haven't said anything. Of course you can't hear them. They're not— ah, okay. Daniel, can you talk?

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Can you hear that?

**Speaker A:** Yep, I heard it. Okay, all good. I'll go on mute now. I'll just listen to you guys. All right, carry on.

**Speaker B:** So we were talking about clinging. Are you clinging right now?

**Speaker A:** Oh, Dhammarato, I can barely hear you, like barely.

**Speaker B:** You're not going in right now.

**Speaker D:** Dhammarato, Robert says that he can barely hear you.

**Speaker B:** How about now? Can you hear me now?

**Speaker A:** Perfect, crystal clear.

**Speaker B:** Say what?

**Speaker A:** Crystal clear.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay. Yep. All right, so we'll just leave the mic right there. Great. Well, if you're not clinging now, then what's the worry? The worry is, is it all cling into the future? Well, most of the clinging is done ignorantly. What does that mean? Is that we're clinging to something and we don't even know we're doing it. So the whole point of the teaching about Anapanasati is to start looking at what we're doing. If you're clinging, know it, because if you know what you're doing, you can do something about it. You can make a change if you can see what it is. It's hard to skin a rabbit you can't catch, and it's hard to catch a rabbit if you don't know where it is. But if you know where the rabbit is, then you can catch it, and if you can catch it, you can skin it. Okay, that's what the teaching of the Buddha is, is that being able to watch where the rabbits are— the rabbits of the mind.

**Speaker C:** That's the investigation, right?

**Speaker B:** That's the investigation, to remember there's rabbits out there, you better pay attention. And if you can see them, you can do something about them. And much of those rabbits are actually our attitudes. So if you have the attitude, I need something, then the rabbit of need will come up. But if you already have the attitude of, I don't need anything, then rabbit needs are unlikely to come up. And so another thing to do then would be to start monitoring your mood, monitor your state of mind. That in fact is written right into the Anapanasati, but we don't really see it. But in the Citta Nipassana part, the third part, it's actually the mind state, not the mind's objects. So going back to the analogy of the pickup, that it doesn't matter so much about what the pickup is loaded down with. The question is, is the pickup capable of managing that load? And that's the attitude. In other words, if you put a load on the pickup and it has the wrong attitude, that means it's going to fall over in the direction that it's leaning. And so actually, that's what attitude— scientifically, that's what the word attitude means. It means the direction things are leaning. And so if you're not leaning at all, then you can handle a whole lot more weight. For instance, in the palm of the hand, if I can put 5-pound load right on the hand, I can hold that. But if I put 5 pounds on this little finger over here, it's not going to be able to handle it. It's out of balance. So this is basically what we mean then, is that our attitude becomes upright. And the attitude of a victim means that we're leaning strongly in one direction or another. Like, I need a drink, or I need a girl, or I need a car, or I need, I need, I need. Whatever it is is because the mind is leaning in the direction of it's not okay without it. So if we can bring the mind back up into that place of middle ground where gravity pulls straight down as opposed to gravity pulling it over to the side. And we are born that way. We are born as victims. You couldn't possibly have it any other way. No newborn kid— in fact, they talked about that as part of the magic of the Buddha, that when he took his— when he was newly born, he took 7 steps and then what, roared like a lion or something like that? He made some claim some kind of magical stuff like that. The fact is that everybody, including Jesus and the Buddha, when they were born, they were born as victims. They needed to be taken care of. That when the Buddha's mother died after 7 days, he got the nourishment and the mothering that he needed from his aunt. No newborn kid is going to be able to, you know, pop right out and start having a philosophical argument with the doctor as to whether or not the doctor should be beating the kids on the bottom to get them to take their first breath. No, the baby has no choice about that. I remember when that happened. There I was in a hot tub, dark, beautiful music playing, And all of a sudden the earthquake happens. The bottom dropped out. The next thing I know, Dr. Young is holding me up by the heels, beating me on the ass. Well, I let out a yell so loud and so long I didn't even stop yelling until I was about 35. That's when I showed up at Wat Soan Mook, by the way. And I spent a whole lifetime of yelling because I wasn't happy, because I was beaten in the butt by a doctor just to try to get me. I didn't need his help to breathe. I didn't. But that's how we all start out. We start out as a victim. The question is, are you going to remain a victim?

**Speaker C:** Oh, for the first time on retreat ever, I had for a couple of days, for like 3 days No matter what kind of state my mind got into, I could clean it out and come back into wholesomeness. So that's— I really felt like an Anagami then. Like, yeah, there's really nothing I cannot get out of.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's what happens. In fact, everybody who goes to a retreat, all, especially all the students, since there's occasionally somebody at the retreat who's not But almost all the students come into the retreat as a victim. The question is, can you come out of that victimhood in the retreat and leave the retreat as a lion? Or are you going to remain a victim throughout the entire 7 days? Most people remain the victim. They continue to claim, they continue to want things. They don't come to the point of things are good enough, I'm satisfied. The word Sukkha actually is a key word, though it's almost never used. I bet he didn't use the word Sukkha once in that retreat. You know what the word Sukkha actually means? Well, you can look at it and see that in fact sukha and dukkha must be opposites. I know for sure in even the Gujarati language, dukhi and sukhi are opposite. In the Thai language, dukkha and suk are opposites. In the Pali, dukkha and sukha are opposites. So what we need to do is to practice. If you're going to come out of dukkha, why don't we practice getting into sukha? That's the whole point, is coming into a state of Sukkha. And Sukkha, I think, is in fact step 6 of Anapanasati, right there in the sutta. It's about developing Sukkha. Well, Actually, in the Pali dictionary that I've read, it has actually several words that mean something. One is that it has a state of the feeling of safety and security. Now, safety and security are different than fearlessness. So you have fear on one side, and then you have safety and security on the other, But somewhere in between is this thing called fearlessness, which means that there is a danger and you got to go take care of it, as opposed to there is a danger and it's going to get me. But this feeling that we want to develop is the feeling of Anagami, it's not dangerous. Danger is just a thought that I had. That's the unwholesome thought. This is dangerous. So a better thought would have is, I'm out of here. This is not dangerous. So we don't develop the— the word, by the way, in the Pali is Abaya, and Abaya is translated as fearlessness. Because it's the opposite of fear, except that fearlessness is not the opposite of fear. It's closer to bravery in the face of fear. What we're looking for is a true opposite of fear, is not at all afraid. I feel safe, I feel secure. So that's Sukkha. Dukkha is not Abhayagiri. Abhaya in the sense of being fearless in the face of fear. Sukkha is there's no fear, there's nothing to be afraid of. Yeah, let that cobra bite me, I'm all right. But if I have that attitude, then the cobra is probably not going to strike. It's only if I want to fight with them. You just stop. Then that's the way to do it, is just to stop. And so the point about Sukkha then is the state of being all right, I'm okay, there's nothing to fear. And with that comes comfort. I can get back into a state of comfortableness. And from that state, the final point is satisfaction. Now, in fact, the correct definition of Dukkha is not suffering, it's dissatisfaction. So if you're laid up in the hospital, let us say that the story is that you're doing a slalom, you're downhill going on your skis, and all of a sudden you do something wrong and you wind up hitting a big barrel of gasoline that happens to go off. And so now, because you've hit it, you've broken every bone in your body or near abouts, and also you're on fire, but you don't die. They get you to the hospital and now you're— they can't put you in a body cast because you got all these burns, but they do something with traction or whatever like that. Okay, so you're talking about huge amount of sensations of broken bones, wounds, and burns, right? Is that suffering?

**Speaker C:** That sounds like suffering, yeah.

**Speaker B:** That'll do until I can come up with a better definition of suffering. Intense pain all over the body will do, right? But the real point is that it's not that it's suffering in this, in that sense, is that we don't like it. We intentionally don't like it. We intentionally don't like being burned. We intentionally don't like having all of our bones broken and all the muscles bruised. We don't like it. That is Dukkha. It's the not liking. But most of the Dukkha is not. I mean, how many of you have ever been in that? This is just a story. It's just a concept. You've not actually been in the hospital with burns and broken bones. Have you? I have.

**Speaker C:** You've been on a lot of motorcycles too, so this sounds like a personal story.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, look at that, that leg is both burned and broken. In fact, this wound here in the back is where that other smaller bone came right out the back of it. Okay, so guess what? When it happened, it didn't hurt, but in the back of the pickup truck riding to the hospital, it began to hurt.

**Speaker D:** You had the adrenaline rush, right?

**Speaker B:** Uh, shock. Yeah. Well, when the shock wears off, the pain comes. But we call it pain because we don't like it. And so, um, that's the real point, is that we don't like it. That is the Dukkha. Is being dissatisfied with the situation as it is. Don't like it. So Sukkha is in the state of— well, you do like it, you're satisfied with it, it's good enough. And you develop that state to where everything is okay. In fact, I imagine all four of you are sitting here, yeah, this is okay. Sitting here listening to a humorous Dhamma talk, not a problem, no worries. So you're already in that state of Dukkha, Nirodha. You're not in the state of suffering right now at all. But I bet on the retreat there were times when you were in a state of dissatisfaction. You didn't like your posture, you didn't like it because the bell didn't ring, you wanted out of here, it wasn't comfortable. Were you in that state?

**Speaker D:** Every once in a while.

**Speaker B:** Every once in a while. Yeah, it comes up. How about you, Daniel? Were you in that state?

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** You didn't like it in the moment, right? How about you, Rick? Yeah. Yeah. So what do you do about it? How about you, Carl?

**Speaker A:** Awesome.

**Speaker B:** Even playing game. All right, well, don't you recognize when you go into those states of not liking that you've got a choice? I mean, you made the choice of not of not liking it. But we do that ignorantly, because who would wisely make a choice of not liking something?

**Speaker C:** When I remembered it, it was so obvious to me, and then I couldn't see it anymore, and I got back.

**Speaker B:** Into—.

**Speaker C:** When I saw it, it was like, "Yeah, there cannot be any other way than to be satisfied right now." But you keep forgetting it.

**Speaker D:** This was something that happened to me too. And I started using the thought, "It's okay to forget.".

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Because we can often be hard on ourselves for forgetting, which causes even more.

**Speaker B:** Dhamma. I like this.

**Speaker D:** But if we remember that, yeah, forgetting happens.

**Speaker B:** Human.

**Speaker D:** It's part of the path.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's right. That's one of the common things that students do, is that they will start practicing correctly and then they'll forget. Goenka talks about it, that when the mind wanders away, never mind, start again. But when the mind wanders away, we don't know it. But when we then recognize that the mind has wandered away, that's when we start doing mental karate on ourselves, that's when we start beating ourselves up. "Oh, you shouldn't be letting the mind wander away! Oh, you forgot! What kind of dude are you? I mean, you're in a retreat, you're supposed to remember to be happy!" So the question is, can you come back out of that state too? So it actually takes kind of two different Satis. One is to recognize that the mind has wandered away, and then number two Sati is to recognize, "That's okay, I remembered this time, now I remember." So congratulate yourself for remembering rather than fussing at yourself for having forgotten. Because you've been fussing at yourself for having forgotten thousands of times. That's the habit, easy to fall into. And so the right way to look at it is, is that when the mind wanders away and you forget, that's okay. I remember now. Now What a relief it is that I'm easy on myself.

**Speaker E:** I like how the guy passes like a Rocky music and this to me goes in if you're in a boxing match and you take a punch and you're like, oh, I took a punch. Now I keep taking another punch. I'm going to keep taking these punches forever and you never get back into the fight, never bring up that attitude. Oh wait, I can actually handle it. I'm still alive, I took a punch, but I'm still going forward. It's that kind of bringing back the attitude again into the Anicca.

**Speaker B:** Actually, yes, that's an interesting analogy. Have you ever heard of the concept or the thing that a good trainer will say that if you get knocked down, if you get knocked out, don't get back up immediately, wait for the count of 9. Have you ever heard that?

**Speaker C:** No.

**Speaker B:** Okay, why do we wait for the count of 9? It's to collect our mind together again, to come back into the attitude of, "I can do this, I can handle this." Not only that, but you've got the count of 9 to rest, take a few deep breaths, everything is okay, and then when the count of 9 comes, you go, "Bang!".

**Speaker C:** You're ready for the Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you're ready for it. Right now. Okay, so this is the way that we can handle it, is that slow down, take it easy. Yeah, I just knocked myself out because I forgot. Never mind. Okay, I'm ready. That's the way to do it. But a lot of the meditation teachers don't teach it that way. Because they're already to the point of, "Oh, you're not supposed to cling." But that's the rule. But everybody clings. So take it easy. It's okay that you cling. Know when you cling, because then you have a choice to come out of the clinging. You know you've got a heavy load, it's okay to drop it. And now you'll pick up another load later, but you've already gotten to the habit of dropping it.

**Speaker C:** Even when I remember to do this, I have those thoughts, and sometimes I get into a state of satisfaction, and sometimes it just seems to miss. But I guess it's just like one moment mind moment of satisfaction and then instant Dukkha, so it seems like it doesn't do anything.

**Speaker B:** But if you're aware, you can say, "Aha, I see that too. Never mind, start again.".

**Speaker E:** But that happens as well, because the attitude, you don't keep up with the attitude or feeling the attitude. You congratulate yourself, but then you have to follow up with the feeling. Oh wait, I just got get rid of it, then that feeling carries to the next moment. Feeling is very important.

**Speaker C:** It's so simple, but it's hard to do it consistently.

**Speaker E:** When you say the words, right, so you say it's hard to do consistently, but if you see that it's not hard to do consistently, if you feel it, right, you say the words, but feel it. Is it that hard? Is it really that hard when you feel it?

**Speaker C:** Everything's easy peasy right now.

**Speaker E:** There you go, that's what you bring in. It's not vocabulary, as we explained.

**Speaker B:** This is Anicca, right? It's not vocabulary.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that's what I felt as well, that I should do more with the feeling instead of the thinking. When I did that, it became a lot easier.

**Speaker B:** Well, going back to the point then about the distinction between the anima, the animus, the yin, the yang, of the masculine and the feminine, you can think of it especially in our society, Western society, the thinking is scientific. That there's a distinction between the head and the heart. And that we're not nearly enough heart-oriented, but deep inside we know that. That's where the clinging comes from, is because it's really all about feeling anyway.

**Speaker D:** There was a really good Ajahn Samatha quote similar to what you're saying at the retreat, and in the quote he talks about we have the mind, the heart, and the body, and you can use that chart for the practice. And, you know, we have the thinking and the feeling and the instinct working together harmoniously, not one— watching the other.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly. Well, basically, that's how we're born, as in the state of victimhood, is because the instincts are is primary, we run completely by instinct, we're not thinking and we're not feeling so much, or the feelings that we do have are based upon instinct. And people can grow up and still live their lives instinctively, and in fact, this is the— you've heard the Western concept of critical thinking versus just accepting. Well, that means instinctual, that we just accept things. For instance, I don't know what that guy looks like, he's got a turban on, he must be dangerous! It's those instincts of, if I don't know it, it must be dangerous. And so, if we can then develop the head so that we can see more clearly, then we can begin to take over the instincts from the head, but we still are missing that part of the emotion. We haven't been able to educate our emotions to the point that we could feel the way that we want to feel. That's the part that's missing. And so The whole point then is to get the adult, the thinking part, in gear so that it can give the feelings what they want. And those two are working closely together. And overcome the instinct, overcome all of the way things should be and all of that. Then the mind becomes whole or integrated because the rules don't run your life anymore, the way things are supposed to run, the instinctive way that we see things, that we can see things clearly and then we can feel. So now that we've got all three of those things in harmony with each other, that's what's called the Samadhi mind. That's when we're completely well-balanced. And that many of the retreats, especially if they're taught by a Westerner, they're still coming from that scientific, you got to get it right mentality, which is only still trying to educate the scientific part of the mind. And what the real teaching of the Buddha is, is that we got to educate the emotional side. It's the Vedana, it's the way that we feel. So that we can balance correctly. And if you feel good, then what else do you need? If you're satisfied, isn't that enough? And in fact, if you feel satisfied and feel satisfied over and over and over again, Doesn't that give you a sense of accomplishment, a sense of success? And when you have success over and over again, doesn't that then give you the feeling of wealth? You've got plenty. You're overflowing with beneficial things. So we start off kind of empty in a sense of deprivation. And eventually, we come to the feeling of being wealthy, but we still are empty. That happens with ignorance. You know that ignorance starts with Paticcasamuppada, it's actually part of the Second Noble Truth. But in fact, if you go through all 10 fetters, Ignorance is the last fetter, it's the highest one. Why is that? Why is it both the deepest and the last to go? That's where we start and that's where we end, is with ignorance. But this is the way that that happens. We start with a vast amount of ignorance, and as we improve, as we gain knowledge, as we gain strength of mind, and as we gain power over our feelings, The ignorant feeling inside gets very small so that we can accept the fact that we don't know so much. We don't know. I mean, we do. I've never formed a star. I don't know how they're formed, not really. I can talk about what the scientists say about it, but guess what? I don't care. Who knows what the future is going to be of the stock market? The answer is I'm going to be okay. I don't care. And so what we do is we leave that vast amount of ignorance because we don't have to know everything. And yet when we are raised in the kind of school system that we are, every child thirsts for knowledge. We have a thirst for knowledge. I gotta know, I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know. And we continue to learn, but we don't ever come to the full state of this satisfaction, "I know enough." There's always more to learn. But you have also heard the story that the truly wise man knows how ignorant he is. It's only the idiots who think they know everything. And so, we wind up being acceptance. Even of our ignorance. There's so much to know, guess what, I don't need it, I can be happy, I've got enough. That's where the quality of enough comes in. Because people, I mean, how many of you can imagine, at least in the retreat that you guys were just in, that a lot of people were confused. They wanted to know what to do now, what is this? You can ask the teacher, Okay, a lot of people have a lot of confusion, and yet what Reinhardt was telling you was enough, just to sit there and watch the breath, make some changes. That's all you need to do. That was enough.

**Speaker C:** Make some changes. He didn't mention that impermanence of things.

**Speaker E:** Just watch the impermanence of things, how they come and go.

**Speaker B:** Isn't that a change from being ignorant of it? Yeah, yeah, it's all based upon a change model. The question is, is this enough change? Can you come to enough? The answer to that is, right now it's enough. I know how to practice correctly. I don't have to know the answer to every question. And yet I have had students that just ask, ask, ask question after question after question when they've already got all they need, but they don't feel satisfied because they want to know more. You've all been in that state. I want to know more, I want to know more, I want to know more. When are you ever going to come to the point of, I know enough, this is enough?

**Speaker E:** That's like Tao. We were talking about that as well on the way here, how the teachings of meditation were portrayed one way there, and you enter it with what we already know and learned.

**Speaker B:** Anapanasati.

**Speaker E:** And then we're kind of comparing. So I found myself, first days, first one or two days, is experimenting with what is being said by them and trying to put this concentration practice, and then like, it is not really as good as this other thing that I have going on. Why am I even questioning it so much? Why am I not just doing what I know works best for me? Why am I not trusting myself enough to know that this is the way to go because of the feeling, not because it's being said by them mentally? Verbally, but because of the feeling, I know I already come in happy into retreat. As we talked, I came in happy, and I was feeling happy meditating. So that's what I found a lot in the.

**Speaker B:** Retreat. Well, the retreats are taught basically to people as if they had never heard the first word of Dhamma. And you guys have gone into the retreat with at least enough already, so you've gone beyond that first retreat. But Reinhard's got to start someplace with the brand new students, and the fact that you've got more information makes you hopefully better off rather than confused.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I was really glad that I.

**Speaker D:** Was able to follow your teachings before.

**Speaker E:** I went into the retreat because I don't know how I would have fared if it was just like only that.

**Speaker B:** Daniel. Set your cell phone on that over here.

**Speaker C:** This one?

**Speaker B:** No, right there, the ironing board. Set your phone on the ironing board and plug it in.

**Speaker C:** Perfect.

**Speaker B:** Very aware. Yes, so we have to have the right attitude that there is really nothing wrong with the retreat. And you would have known that if you had gone into it completely ignorantly. But now that you've got more knowledge, more practice going on, it's actually quite easy to judge the teacher. It's sort of like— here's an example: the college professor who had just got his PhD in mathematics and computer science from MIT comes to the university to teach. And he's got a big face on, because he's teaching a level of mathematics that's well beyond what the students would teach in the first grade. In fact, he would look down on the first grade teacher because all she can teach is numbers and arithmetic at best, where he's PhD. But then you'll have the old professor who has been teaching around a lot, and he fully appreciates the first grade teacher because if the kids hadn't gone through the first grade, they wouldn't be ready for the bright-eyed, bushy-tailed new MIT PhD in mathematics. They wouldn't be ready for him. But it takes a bit of maturity to recognize in this regard, is that we have to give Reinhard a big hearty congratulations, because he's starting people at the very beginning. But you already know quite a lot yourself, so you can take what you do know, a little bit deeper teaching of the Dharma, and put that into practice even while you're doing your retreat. Because the real issue is, can you enjoy the retreat? Can you enjoy it? If you can enjoy the retreat, you can enjoy anything.

**Speaker C:** I enjoyed it for sure.

**Speaker B:** Enjoy without judging, enjoying it without comparing what this teacher said and what that teacher says, and they don't mix, so they don't match. Rather to take it from the position that basically Buddhism is taught in two different frames of reference. It's taught in the beginning to ordinary people in an ordinary way. And that would be the way that I would ordinarily teach it until I had conversations with Bhante John Po. And he says, no, go ahead like Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and teach right from the supramundane. Right from the top, right from the noble, there will be students who understand. Those are the students that you want to teach, or those who are at the top already. And so in a way, from Reinhardt, he's teaching ordinary students. That in fact, you probably recognize that most of the students in that retreat at Deepavuwan were probably tourists. They were in Thailand for pleasure. And so they took the retreat because that's the thing to do, right? Must be some pleasure in there someplace, and it's cheap. And then they wind up in a boot camp because the boot camp is really in their mind. You don't like it because there's nothing happening. They're used to— in fact, they came to Thailand for something, and then they go to the retreat for something, and they wind up that they've got a whole lot of nothing. About the only thing that you get out of retreat is a bell, and you— and the bell rings and you don't want to go, and then the bell rings, wow, what a relief it is, and then the bell rings and you got to go. And so you're up, down, up, down, up, down. That bell runs your life until you recognize that. When you can see that, then you can say, "Oh, the bell doesn't mean a thing. The bell ring is all empty, doesn't mean a thing." That what matters is, when the bell rings, how do I feel? Learn to control your feelings. That's what it's really all about, because that's where the Dukkha is. The Dukkha is that you feel dissatisfied. Can you come back to feeling satisfied? This is good enough. Very simple teaching.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, really so simple.

**Speaker B:** This is enough, good enough, not nearly the end of knowledge, but it's all the knowledge you need. It's the knowledge to be happy right now. So what else did Lionheart teach? I mean, he talked for an hour every day. Or more.

**Speaker D:** Uh, probably my favorite thing that he did was the Wheel of Life teaching.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that was good. Oh, they drug that old Tonka out. Yes, I've seen those. There's at Wat Soan Mok, they've got several really, really big ones. There's one of them that is, uh, uh, David's not here, but he's been to Wat Soan Mok. At the Spiritual Theater, they've got a giant one. In the old hall, there's one. They also have one in the retreat. And so I would not be surprised at all if they don't have it. Now, at the top of the tongpa, you'll see a bear just grabbing with his paws and his teeth, and he's holding the thing up, right? And then you have the circle. Well, those The drawings, the pictures inside of that circle are emotional drawings. They're artwork. And yet when we see them, we read them scientifically. And because of that, we don't quite understand what that wheel of dependent origination is. It's actually not necessarily a wheel, but it's depicted as a wheel. That in fact, if there is any wheelness like it, it's that it goes all the way around and then we come through it backwards. That we're taught it forwards, from this causes this, causes this, causes this. But we actually practice it backwards in the sense of things happen sequentially over time. How quick are you? And when you're slow, it's going to be all the way to the end of the cycle. For instance, most ordinary people are in Dukkha. They don't even know that they've gotten there. But on occasions, people do recognize that they've gone too far. The example of that was when a husband and wife were having a fight, and then one of them will see that they've gone too far. I've said too much. I've either hit my wife or I've insulted her too much, and she's starting to cry or whatever like that. Okay, so eventually we'll see that the Dukkha. Then we'll stop. The guy will slam the door on his way out, and that's the end of that stale. But if he is wise, he will recognize when he is in the argument and put a stop to it before he goes too far. And then if he was a little sharper than that, he'll see, "Oh, this is an argument, let's finish it." And then if he's sharper than that, he will say, "Oh, I disagree with my wife, but there's no reason to argue with her." And if he's sharper than that, he can say, "Oh, she said something and I didn't like it." And if he's sharper than that, Come down a step. Oh, she said something and look what I did with it. I perceived it, then I didn't like it, and then that hit me, and then I had feelings, and then I started to cling, and then I started to shout, and then I started to hit. Right? And so along the way we can come down to, back to the fact of, oh, my wife said something. And that's why we want to practice it backwards, so we can see things before it goes too far. But when we see it in that realm and then we see it scientifically, we say, "Oh, it's a circle, which means that Dukkha leads to ignorance." Well, doesn't it? Doesn't in fact the snake bite its own tail? That when we are really in bad feelings and Dukkha, aren't we really stupid? And then we start the cycle all over again. But the real point about the dependent origination is that it's our ignorance that, based upon all of our past stuff, that when we hear the.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key teachings and discussion points:

**Core Theme:** Moving from victimhood and dissatisfaction (Dukkha) to satisfaction, safety, and emotional mastery through mindful awareness.

**Main Teachings:**

1.  **Awareness of Clinging:** The practice begins with noticing the "rabbits of the mind"—our clingings, needs, and aversions. We often cling ignorantly, without knowing it. The path is to first **know** when we are clinging, as awareness creates the possibility for change.

2.  **The Centrality of Attitude:** Our mental "attitude" (the direction the mind is leaning) is crucial. A mind leaning in need or aversion is unbalanced like an overloaded truck. An upright, balanced mind can handle life's "loads" with stability. Victimhood is a leaning attitude of "I need" or "things are not okay."

3.  **From Dukkha to Sukkha:** The goal is not just the absence of suffering, but the cultivation of its opposite: **Sukkha**—a state of safety, security, comfort, and ultimate **satisfaction**. Dukkha is fundamentally **dissatisfaction**. The practice is to repeatedly cultivate the feeling that "this is enough, I am satisfied, I am okay."

4.  **Practical Application in Meditation:**
    *   When the mind wanders or you fall into dissatisfaction, the key is **non-judgmental recognition**. Don't beat yourself up for forgetting; instead, gently note it and kindly return. Congratulate yourself for remembering, not for having forgotten.
    *   Use the "boxer's count of 9" analogy: When knocked down (by forgetfulness or negativity), use the pause to regroup, breathe, and re-establish a wholesome attitude before re-engaging.

5.  **Integrating Head, Heart, and Instinct:** True balance (Samadhi) comes from harmonizing three aspects:
    *   **The Head (Thinking):** Scientific, investigative understanding.
    *   **The Heart (Feeling):** The emotional landscape, which is where Dukkha and Sukkha are directly experienced.
    *   **The Instincts:** Our primal, often fear-based, reactions.
    The Buddha's teaching aims to educate the **emotional side** most of all, so we can feel the way we choose to feel.

6.  **The "Enough" of Wisdom:** Spiritual maturity involves moving from an insatiable "thirst to know" to a deep contentment with "knowing enough" to be happy now. It includes accepting a vast field of unknown things without anxiety. The wise person knows the extent of their ignorance and is satisfied.

**Context from the Retreat Discussion:**
The speakers reflect on a recent meditation retreat, noting that many attendees remain in a state of "victimhood" (wanting, dissatisfaction) throughout. The teaching at such retreats is often basic, geared toward beginners. The challenge for more experienced practitioners is to avoid comparing or judging the teachings, and instead use the retreat structure to practice generating Sukkha—finding satisfaction and enjoyment in the present moment, regardless of external circumstances.

**Key Analogies Used:**
*   **Skinning Rabbits:** You must first be aware of (catch) your mental clingings to deal with them.
*   **The Pickup Truck:** Attitude is the balance that allows you to carry life's loads.
*   **The Boxer:** After a setback, take a mindful pause to recover your balanced attitude.
*   **The Bell in Retreat:** External events (like schedule bells) are neutral; suffering arises from our dissatisfied reaction to them.

**Overall Message:** The path is about developing a mindful, forgiving awareness of your present state, consciously cultivating a satisfied and balanced heart (Sukkha), and thereby freeing yourself from the cycle of victimhood and dissatisfaction.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Speaker B, Dhammarato) uses several metaphors and stories to illustrate the teachings on mindfulness, clinging, and the path to contentment. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors:**

1.  **Rabbits of the Mind:** This is the central metaphor. The "rabbits" represent unwholesome mental states, attitudes, and clingings that arise in the mind. The process is:
    *   **Finding the rabbit:** You must first be aware of (investigate) where these states are.
    *   **Catching the rabbit:** Once you see them, you can "catch" them (acknowledge and understand them).
    *   **Skinning the rabbit:** After catching, you can deal with them, remove their power, or let them go.

2.  **The Pickup Truck and its Load:** The mind is compared to a pickup truck. The "load" represents life's experiences and challenges. The crucial factor is not the load itself, but the **attitude** (the truck's alignment/balance). If the truck is leaning (wrong attitude), it will tip over under weight. If it's upright (balanced attitude), it can handle much more.

3.  **Holding a Weight in the Palm vs. on a Finger:** This extends the pickup truck metaphor. A 5-pound weight is easy to hold in the balanced palm (upright, accepting mind) but will overwhelm a single, off-balance finger (a mind leaning with craving or aversion). This illustrates how a balanced attitude allows us to handle difficulty.

4.  **The Boxer Waiting for the Count of 9:** When you get knocked down (by forgetfulness, distraction, or a negative mental state), don't jump up immediately. Use the "count of 9" (a pause) to collect yourself, regain your balanced attitude, and then re-engage mindfully and with strength.

5.  **Head, Heart, and Instinct (The Triune Model):** The speaker describes the human being as having three parts that need to harmonize:
    *   **The Head:** The thinking, scientific, analytical part.
    *   **The Heart:** The emotional, feeling part.
    *   **The Instinct:** The primal, reactive part.
    The goal of practice is to educate the emotional heart (through feelings like satisfaction) so it can work in harmony with a clear-seeing head, thereby overcoming reactive instincts. This harmony is **Samadhi**.

### **Stories & Anecdotes:**

1.  **The Story of His Own Birth:** He humorously recounts being born, describing it as an earthquake where the doctor beat him to make him breathe. He claims he "yelled" from that moment until age 35, when he found Buddhism. This personalizes the idea that we are all **born as victims**—helpless, needing care, and reacting instinctively. The central question becomes: will you remain a victim?

2.  **The Motorcycle Accident:** He references a personal story of a severe accident involving burns and broken bones. He uses this to make a philosophical distinction:
    *   The intense physical sensations were not the ultimate problem.
    *   The real **Dukkha** was the *dissatisfaction*, the "not liking" the pain and the situation.
    *   This contrasts with **Sukkha**, the state of being "okay" or satisfied even amidst difficulty.

3.  **The College Professor vs. The First-Grade Teacher:** This story addresses the tendency to judge teachings (like those at a beginner's retreat). The brilliant MIT PhD (the advanced student) might look down on the first-grade teacher (the retreat teaching basics), but the wise professor knows the first-grade teacher's work is essential foundation. The lesson: appreciate teachings for the level they are meant for, and don't let advanced knowledge lead to judgment.

4.  **The Arguing Couple & The Wheel of Life:** He references the Buddhist "Wheel of Life" (a teaching on dependent origination) not as a scientific diagram, but as an emotional map. He illustrates it with the story of a couple arguing. A wise person can trace the sequence backwards in the moment: from the act of hitting/shouting (**Dukkha**), back to clinging, to feeling, to perception, and finally to the initial sensory contact. This "tracing backwards" allows one to stop the cycle earlier and earlier.

### **Core Conceptual Opposites Used:**
*   **Victim vs. Lion:** Moving from a state of helpless need to one of strength and self-sufficiency.
*   **Dukkha (dissatisfaction) vs. Sukkha (satisfaction/okay-ness):** The fundamental dynamic. Practice is about moving from the former to the latter.
*   **Fear vs. Safety/Security vs. Fearlessness:** He carefully distinguishes between the absence of fear (safety) and bravery in the face of fear (fearlessness). Sukkha is linked to feeling safe and secure.
*   **Empty (deprived) vs. Wealthy (enough):** The journey from feeling deprived and needy to feeling "wealthy" in terms of inner contentment and the feeling of "having enough."

In summary, the speaker uses earthy, relatable metaphors (rabbits, pickup trucks, boxing) and personal stories to make abstract Buddhist concepts like clinging, attitude, investigation, and satisfaction tangible and practical. The overarching narrative is about moving from ignorant victimhood to mindful, satisfied mastery of one's own mind and feelings.
