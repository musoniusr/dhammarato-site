### Transcript


**Speaker A:** I've done it. I've used all my power. I used all my energy and power.

**Speaker B:** All right, Dhamma, tell me what I'm supposed to do about not being good at anything anymore. Like, I had skills and they don't exist anymore.

**Speaker A:** Uh, you had skills, they don't exist.

**Speaker B:** Yes, lots of them, but specifically baking was the one that threw me overboard today.

**Speaker A:** Eddie can't talk for the next 10 minutes. But you're good at baking?

**Speaker B:** No, I'm not anymore. I used to be. That's— this is where this is coming from. I used to be able to like bake a cake without a recipe, and today I underbaked a box cake.

**Speaker A:** Underbaked. So what's the problem?

**Speaker B:** I lost a skill.

**Speaker C:** You didn't lose a skill, you just lost one cake, and you didn't even lose the cake, it's just slightly underbaked. You know, put it back in the oven.

**Speaker A:** Maybe you gained a new skill. You invented a new type of mushy cake or something.

**Speaker C:** Two flies.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it's called Salmonella Special. Exactly my intention.

**Speaker C:** Dogs.

**Speaker A:** Might get it if you feed dogs. Just practice a little more, that's all.

**Speaker B:** So you do, you think I should go through and relearn all of the skills I've lost?

**Speaker A:** What, for baking a cake?

**Speaker B:** Not just baking. Baking is just the most recent skill I've realized I've lost, and I thought I still had it. I went from having like 10 skills.

**Speaker A:** Uh, take some eggs, just take some eggs in a bowl, put some flour and some water, and, uh, put it in the oven, dude.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, one failed cake does not a failed baker make. You can try again. If you've got more flour, more eggs, more butter, more sugar, just do it again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's not hard.

**Speaker B:** I'm not excited by the prospect of relearning 30 years of skills.

**Speaker A:** I baked for quite a while.

**Speaker B:** Maybe these are skills I don't need.

**Speaker A:** No, it's not difficult. It's a lot of, uh, a lot of pretension that makes— seems to make things difficult. You know, we watch all these shows that are like, oh, it has to have this amount of this, and this is not— but I never measure anything. I just like do it. It always turns out okay, you know.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, any, any, in like, in like the physical world, like skills, any skill that we learn is really just practicing something, and every time you do it, you learn a little bit more, and your brain remembers some of it, forgets some of it, and then if you do it regularly enough, you can do it without needing the recipes or the instructions. But then if we don't do something for a while, it's normal that the brain just puts the information into overwrite and then writes over it with other stuff. But it would come back if you want to get back into baking cakes. Just practice more and it'll come back.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, why did you forget?

**Speaker B:** I couldn't forget. I followed a box of instructions.

**Speaker C:** The instructions.

**Speaker A:** Could be wrong. But what led to being able to bake to not being able to bake? Just not doing it enough?

**Speaker B:** Not doing it. Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Oh, just start doing it. A lot of the Zen masters were cooks, you know? So it'll be good Dharma practice. To relearn how to bake.

**Speaker B:** I was hoping that that wasn't the answer. I was hoping— well, actually, I shouldn't say I was hoping that wasn't the answer. I lied. I'm just kidding.

**Speaker A:** Um, or don't bake.

**Speaker B:** That's— I was just— I was— maybe I was hoping that you guys were gonna tell me if it's not a skill you need, then let him go.

**Speaker C:** You don't need it. Shops sell cakes. If you want a cake, just go to the shop and buy a cake. Job done.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** You guys are right. You guys are right. I'll just learn all my skills over again.

**Speaker A:** You can do anything you want. Believe in yourself.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I spent like a year doing this intensive cybersecurity course, and I learned loads of stuff, passed some exams with really good, really high scores, and then couldn't find a job doing it in Vietnam where I am. And now I've forgotten everything. I don't know, I couldn't do anything beyond basic stuff. And that's okay. If I'm interested in it again, I'll start doing it again just for fun. And If not, then I don't, and it can just be fully forgotten, and that's okay.

**Speaker B:** All right, fair, fair. I did, after I had the meltdown, I decided to try again. I had another box, thankfully.

**Speaker C:** How was it?

**Speaker B:** I don't know, it's in the oven. I'll let you guys know.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker C:** I find cake's good, even if it doesn't work out. If it's not too, if it's not too like liquid inside, like if it's still sort of baked, just mix it with some, some ice cream and it's all right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no, the, um, the cake straight up gaslit me. I poked— I mean, it was a bundt cake, so it's like a circle, you know. I poked the thing in, a huge skewer in like every inch through the whole thing, and some of it had even a little crumb come off, but none of it had any raw batter. And then I flipped the thing out and it broke in half, and like none of it somehow was cooked. I don't understand. That's why I had a problem.

**Speaker C:** Was the oven just too low? Was the temperature too low? I don't— I— Or not long enough?

**Speaker B:** I don't know. I can't tell you. That's one thing I never pay attention to is bake time because every oven is different. I just shove the toothpick in or the thermometer and see how it comes out. 'Cause like, that's what bakers do who do it as a career. And it's never gone wrong until today.

**Speaker D:** Well, that's great.

**Speaker C:** You've got like a 99.99% success record.

**Speaker A:** It's like that Zen story that Dhammarato used to say back in the day of the archer, where the Japanese archers, the Zen archers, would just draw back their bow. Fire the arrow. They'd be very aware of what everything they were doing, but once the arrow left the bow, they would turn their back to it because they didn't care if it hit the mark because it was out of their control. They did everything they could, you know. It's like when you bake a cake, just do the best you can. When it's in the oven, it's in God's hands, you know.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, if it doesn't work out, you can blame God instead of yourself.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. You know, the narrative I'm going to write myself instead of— not that I haven't lost a bunch of skills and not that it is not going to not be beneficial to maybe work on them and get them back. But, you know, I really lucked out. You guys are right. I decided to keep baking because I started out doing well at it. And I never underbaked a cake when I first started. So it's okay, you know, one underbaked cake in 15 years is not the end of the world. Or I should say, not the worst way to lose a skill.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, whether it comes out fully cooked or soggy or whatever, doesn't matter. Can you be okay with it no matter how it comes out?

**Speaker B:** No, I can't. But thank you, noble friends, for reassuring me.

**Speaker E:** Not with that attitude.

**Speaker A:** Why can't you be okay with it?

**Speaker B:** Um, well, now I'm just not gonna beat myself up about it, but, um, because you're right, long track record. But, um, I don't know, I guess none of you have ever dealt with like losing— I don't have that many skills, I don't have kids like to be like, oh look, this is what I do with my time, or the world, like this is whatever. Um, not that being okay with breathing isn't awesome. Thanks guys for making me like, whatever, feel better about that skill. But, um, I don't want— I didn't want it. I did it right. It being the only skill someone has, um, especially when I didn't have Anagami in the first place.

**Speaker A:** I don't know, was not— they need one skill.

**Speaker B:** Doing great with that. Clearly.

**Speaker A:** Just push your next breath. It's the only skill anybody needs.

**Speaker C:** I've lost loads of skills over my life, but even breathing, the body does it for you. Like, don't really need any skills. Like, they can be fun. Like, if you get enjoyment from baking cakes and you like baking cakes, then Go bake away, but if a cake doesn't work out sometimes, that's okay. Just throw it in the bin and bake another cake, and that one might work out. There's no perfect cake. Just trying to bake a cake and physical world stuff. Just try, and if it works out this way, it works out this way or that way. So if you don't like the result, just try again. That's all you can do.

**Speaker E:** It can definitely feel crushing sometimes when there's like a bunch of time and effort put into something, especially in the long term, and you lose it. But it's a matter of like letting go of the past. It's not really there anymore because all you have is right now. And all you can really do is take action right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** You're perfectly good enough right now. You don't need a perfect cake.

**Speaker B:** That's what I was gonna say. Uh, oh, now I lost what Dhamma said, but he reminded— something he said earlier reminded me of the same thing, of like, it's— oh, busy work! That's what it was, being like addicted to busy work. And it's like, yeah, especially now that I don't have skills. I'm not necessarily against not having skills. Like, if I wasn't like baking for someone else in the first place, it probably wouldn't have bothered me. And they didn't, right? Like, they don't have to get the cake. They don't, I don't have to rebake it for them. I'm just doing it because, but like, I was like, really? There's no reason. I could do nothing all the time and be satisfied. And that's not that I was particularly ambitious ever, but like, it feels wrong. Even though this is like what all.

**Speaker A:** Of.

**Speaker B:** The mental health stuff has been trying to help me with for years, it just feels wrong.

**Speaker A:** Robert Adams used to say you have to learn to be a good-for-nothing. Just be a good-for-nothing nobody. It's okay.

**Speaker B:** It's just weird that somehow being less ambitious than before is a positive somehow. But it's worked out well so far, up until wanting to bake cake.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, nobody thinks Jetsun Milarepa, the great Tibetan yogi, nobody thinks he was like this failure or something, you know. He sat in a cave doing nothing for like 10 years, 11 years, something.

**Speaker D:** As the.

**Speaker C:** Suffering comes from the wanting, comes from wanting to bake a good cake, from wanting it to turn out and wanting it to be a certain way. And stuff doesn't always work out that way. It's just attachment to wanting to do it, but it's all right if it works out, fine. If it doesn't work out, just try again if you want to, or don't. Both are okay.

**Speaker B:** Labeling it an attachment to lay life makes it easier to digest. Like, oh, if I didn't have these lay people personal connection, real relationship problems, I wouldn't be baking cake for people I care about and I wouldn't have people I care about. So not the worst problem to have, but also way easier if I was just sitting somewhere alone.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, or you can have people that you care about and you love, but you don't have to bake them cakes if you don't. Find enjoyment in the baking process, you can just do something else instead. If you want to do something nice for them, just buy them a cake.

**Speaker B:** I mean, really, this is not recording worthy. We really cleaned up the cake problem really quick, and we're trying to stretch it super hard. Alex, give Give us another 3 minutes on this recording.

**Speaker A:** No, remember, this is the safe space for awkward conversations and silence. It's okay. We don't have to entertain anybody.

**Speaker E:** Oh, I remember now. What I was gonna say is that what I found is the nice part of learning to enjoy doing nothing is that it kind of helps when you're fine with being a good-for-nothing. It helps with like being fine with trying to do something else and failing at it. Because if you start from a point of not caring and you take action, like you don't need to get a certain output from the action to keep taking it. Which is definitely not a, it's not a one-to-one. It still takes individual practice, but there's definitely overlap.

**Speaker B:** You know, you're right. If I was not so hung up on the fact that I was doing these things for so long, I would not be upset about not being able to do them.

**Speaker E:** Your attachment to previous capabilities, attachment to something you put a lot of time and work into being able to do.

**Speaker B:** If this was my first time baking, I probably would have been like, oh.

**Speaker A:** No.

**Speaker B:** Oh no, growing pain.

**Speaker E:** Something, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly. Who cares? It's my first time.

**Speaker E:** Like Oh my God, I've been able to bake so well for so long and now I failed. There's this like, yeah, this feeling of inferiority. I should be good at it. These are the things I should have had, but they're gone now. And all this time and work I put into something is gone.

**Speaker A:** I feel like Dhammarato would say, whether you do good or bad with your cake, can you be joyful while you do it? That's the important thing.

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Well, the problem is, no, I don't think I could hand that cake to someone and feel joy handing it over.

**Speaker E:** But that's the point. What you were doing was not handing someone the cake. You were making it. That's in the future.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** That's fine.

**Speaker B:** No, you're like, like, yeah, it is. Like you said, it's, I just let them know it's salmonella flavored beforehand. And there's no issues. It's the thought that counts.

**Speaker D:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker E:** I mean, draw. Go on.

**Speaker C:** Draw a correlation between like skills and like physical stuff. Like if you used to go to the gym and you worked your way up to be able to lift like really heavy weights and do lots of reps and stuff, and then you don't go for ages, and then you, you go back and you try lifting the same weights, you can be disappointed with the fact that you can't lift the same weight still, or you can be like, oh, that's just what happens when you don't use the muscles. Like, they get weaker, they sort of forget how to do things that they used to be able to. So now I have to start back at a previous point and then work my way back up slowly. Like, the same with mental skills too. If you don't use them, you gotta just take a few steps back and then start again practicing if that's what you want to do.

**Speaker B:** Well, I expected it to be more like the practice and like changing wholesome thoughts and breathing where like, yeah, sometimes you take some time off, but like when you come back to it, it's pretty easy to get back in step with things, you know. I just There was no part of me that went, I could ever expect that, like, poking holes through the cake wouldn't tell me if it's whatever. But silly me for getting attached to 15 years of experience.

**Speaker E:** It is not silly. It is perfectly normal as far as the mind is concerned.

**Speaker B:** It kind of is.

**Speaker E:** It's silly from like a pursuing peace perspective, but in terms of like default human behavior, it is quite normal and expected.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but also.

**Speaker E:** You don't want to be normal because normal people are lame.

**Speaker B:** No, that's what I'm saying. That's the normal way to think about things. That's my point, right? Like I know better. I already know that sometimes things go sideways, like in the strangest way that seems like it literally logically is not possible. I'm surprised that I was so surprised that I could underbake a cake or like the cake could not, could not like liquefy on the skewer. Like, yes, normal people, that, that should be it, right? Like, oh. Past experience tells me this is how the thing is going to go, but like past experience is not necessarily a dictation of future experience, right? And should not be attached to that. And listening to you logic it out for me, I should have already known better and thought about that when it first happened. And also thought about the fact that I didn't underbake a cake when I first started. And like, that too, Ben's right about.

**Speaker E:** That's, that's kind of the funny thing. Like, it's not like you're, it's not like you're gonna wake up on one day and you'll have no more attachments or no more unwholesome thoughts. Like, maybe, but like, unlikely. The biggest difference maker I found is not that you stop having those kinds of thoughts entirely. It's that you recognize and distance yourself from them when they do happen. It's not about starting from the perfect point. It's about maintaining an attitude and like awareness.

**Speaker B:** Well, the good news is that this cake is not Anagami.

**Speaker A:** Yay! That's awesome!

**Speaker C:** Nice. You see, no need to beat yourself up about beating yourself up. Just beat the eggs back up and put it in the oven again.

**Speaker D:** Job.

**Speaker B:** Done.

**Speaker C:** How are you doing, Alex?

**Speaker E:** I am existing.

**Speaker C:** That's good.

**Speaker E:** Right now, I am getting back to bed on time regularly. Because I had a phase where I would like randomly stay up all night and whatever due to attachments to spending time various ways or whatnot. But it is good for the body and important for a particular schedule that I'm holding to go to bed on time consistently. So that is my current practice in terms of mortal stuff. In terms of general existence, I've noticed that life just gets like, it just feels better to exist if I'm smiling. Some kind of physiological response or whatever. That just makes a very large difference in the subjective feeling of life. If I smile, there doesn't have to be a reason. If I do it, then things are just nicer. Delays become amusing instead of annoying is an easy example of it. Just the more positive spin on everything.

**Speaker A:** That's good, man. Ivan, how you doing, dude? I'm sorry, Ben.

**Speaker C:** No, I was just gonna say unreasonable happiness is great. You don't need a reason. Just Yeah, smile at everyone. People think, yeah, I don't know, not everyone likes being smiled at, but it's their back.

**Speaker E:** I mean, the funny thing is that a lot of people do. If you're happy to see someone, people will usually be a lot more happy to see you too. It's infectious.

**Speaker D:** I'm doing good, Dhamma Das. I'm just listening. Doing really well.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker D:** I was just thinking, I was just talking with someone the other day about conditioning, like how Alex talking about just now, it's not like you're going to wake up one day and no more unwholesome thoughts or no more attachment. And I was just talking about we live in a society where messages can be conflicting. You know, you don't see advertisement on the billboard that says, have you spent 10 minutes with yourself today? Or, you know, stuff like, I don't know, just general sense of like taking good care of yourself. But that's not really what's happening in the world. People will ask, you know, people talk about stuff and Like Dhammarato said, just know this is a safe space where you can be awkward, silent, and it's totally cool. And how nice it is to just enjoy that silence. Like the world doesn't really facilitate that sort of thing. So I really like to think about what Ajahn Chah always say, like the affair of the world, just let them be. The mind is just the mind, the preoccupation is preoccupation, and don't pick them up, then the mind's just being the mind, pretty free. And yeah, it's just like how Joni says, I think I heard something she said earlier on, like a lot of things is pointing to the same truth, just different way of saying it. It's pretty much that, like solitude, like make sure your mind is guarded away from all those bullshit. And then it's pretty chill. It's not like you're avoiding things. I mean, it's you being wise about it, what's good for you, what's not good for you. And another here. Something like that. Just keep reminding again and again, this is nice, this is good. And eventually that becomes your reality. It's just, at least I've been reflecting on that. I still catch myself complaining, catch myself, what's that? Oh yeah, feeling like a victim. Catch myself creating stories of things that doesn't exist. And it's funny, just understanding the mind, understanding the conditioning, like it makes sense. Growing up in this society of under this sort of influence for many years, what am I expecting? And I can be okay with that. And I can just wake up and make a wholesome change.

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** It's nice to move from that space where you hear someone say something like don't concern yourself with worldly affairs, because lots of people say that in lots of different phrasings. And not hear like an excuse to not participate in the world or perpetuate, or use it as an excuse to perpetuate like the grossness of the world by not— by like turning a blind eye and like have practiced enough to understand actually what the underlying idea of it is, in that like those are causes and conditions, dependent and originations. Like yes, lots of things, but you're never going to do anything about those things. Even if you do make a dent, you're not doing like real work about things. So don't get so caught up in it. Not don't do it. Just don't hold it so close because it's not the most important thing.

**Speaker E:** I mean, that's the key word is concern. You can take action. For worldly affairs and help people and whatever, but you don't have to feel bad about anything.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but also said in a way where you're like, yes, take action, you're allowed to take action. That action can be practice, that action could be feeding the poor, that action could be, you know, whatever it is. Um, And that's what that, right? Like, yes, action is involved in that statement and in that, that thought and that philosophy. It is not supposed to be used as an excuse to turn a blind eye to, um, like negative worldly things, especially like systems that you might accidentally end up propping up. Like, it's— I most people I like have come into contact with up until like hanging out here in this Sangha with you guys, they would say those things and then use them as an excuse to like turn blind eyes to things that they know are going on that aren't good, or like not have to put out like the effort to do something about them. Like, I don't want to take the action because I don't want to put that effort in, and so I'm going to use this excuse that I'm not supposed to be involved in worldly affairs because they're not concerned with the spiritual path in order to not put forth that effort.

**Speaker D:** You can also see that they'll— how should I put this? Yeah, some people are just gonna be like that. It's totally fine. And it's sort of, it's pretty nice to realize, I always like to say this, like you could just pretty much align yourself with your value, you know. If you value this, which true wise intention, reflection-wise one thing, you know, that you want to be like this, you want to help the world, and you go forth and do it. And if people, you know, like you said, or using skills or whatever kind of how we see it, it doesn't really matter. Like, yeah, let them, and it's totally okay. Like how Dhammarato said last time, I think it's really funny and simple. You know, if you want to help the world, go ahead and do it. And it's pretty much just saying like, because I see this sometimes happening in some spiritual circle, you know, people just complaining about the state of the world, saying how terrible it is. And it's like, I mean, what's the benefit of just you know, you, you, you, you keep perpetuating your own suffering. Like, like, how is that? I think this is something that really differs. Um, you know, there's a, you know, in modern terms lately there's a word called engaged Buddhism, and then like there's activism, you know, the mundane way of looking at things. Um, I think, well, this is my opinion, the way I see it, like, people that really actually practice, that really understood the Buddha, Dharma For any people that really understood, it doesn't have to be from the Buddha, Dharma, but you know, they really understood, they just kind of engage and do it. And there's no this sort of like, oh, the world should be like this, you know, it should be like that. It just kind of just do it. There's this very acceptance of the world is messed up and it's okay, you know, the world's messed up but I'm still okay. I'm just gonna do what I think that might make things a bit better. But, you know, the way I see activism, they have this very general sense of like doom and gloom, you know. It's like this very weird— the mind justifies, like, you know, I feel bad, you should feel bad, and everyone should feel bad to care about this. It's like, what? You know, like, like, it's also delusional because they are basically saying that if we are upset enough, the world will change to better. Like, The world, like, I don't know, like, good luck stopping the war in Ukraine. Good luck stopping the tariff war that's happening between US and China. Like, what do you think you can do about that? Like, you know, it's almost like this really seeing things the way it is. Like, the world is just like this. And, you know, what you can do is align with your value. This, you think doing this you know, reflects what you, you know, sincerely want from a wise perspective. And, you know, wisdom is basically saying this is all you can do, and you can feel good about your effort, and whatever happens happens. Kind of like baking the cake, abandoning the mundane result wanting behavior we've been taught for so long. So yeah.

**Speaker B:** I love how we're all attached to the idea of— or we're okay with the idea of just eating raw cake now. Um, yeah.

**Speaker D:** As long as it's eatable.

**Speaker B:** I lost it making a joke. I agree, Ivan. You made me think of something else, but then I screwed myself out of the actual substance.

**Speaker A:** The actual substance was your joke. It's the joyful humor It's always good. And you know, it's like if we remind ourselves too that like if we break it down and make things simple, it's like why are most people into Buddhism and what's the practice? A lot of it has to do with loving kindness and compassion and meditation, Sati. So you do your Sati, and if an injured dog or bird or human comes to you and needs help, you help them, and you go about your day, you know what I mean? And you can, if you choose, if you want to go and like Ivan was saying and do activism and try to save the world, you could do that too.

**Speaker C:** But.

**Speaker A:** You know, the world's kind of always been on fire, and there's all these different fires throughout, and each generation thinks that their fire is the most important and most urgent. But everybody's thought that about their own time, you know, but it is what it is. You know, the world's always been on fire. And it doesn't mean that don't do anything about it, but like I was saying, like, live your life, try to do the best you can, and if something occurs, you handle it. And you don't necessarily have to go out there and find it, you know. Life is such that usually those natural things kind of find us. And if everybody just kind of lived that way, ironically, that would change the world for the better. If everybody just Um, like Duncan Trussell was saying on this podcast I listened to the other day, it's like everybody did their own little piece with the people, the animals around them, the environments just around them, that actually would change the world, you know. But you got one person here trying to go off to save the world, one person here trying to set it on more fire, one person here, you know, it's, uh, it's all scattered. But if we just did our best with what we can around us, that would really help. And that's kind of what the Dhamma is, you know, the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha. You know, it's in a way, it's one of the best things that can help bring the world to a cooler state. Because if everybody started practicing the Dhamma, It's not we have to like go out there and preach and like make people force them to believe this, but like with whatever they believe, whether it's Christianity or whatever, you know, just get everybody to breathe and relax more and help those beings that come to them when they come to them. It's quite simple and beautiful, you know.

**Speaker D:** It's interesting. I read something that— well, I think it's insightful. Like, you know, people that— I try not to use this word, but I can't find a better word. Let's just call it, you know, people that's really well practiced in the Buddha Dharma and, you know, they're engaged in it. They don't really What's that word? Like, in a weird way, they are okay with the world being fucked up. They're really okay with it because it's— well, it's just— what is it? Like, the scientists kind of say, you know, in another 100,000 years, the sun's gonna swallow up the earth. I can't remember what's how long it will be.

**Speaker E:** It is billions of years, not 100,000.

**Speaker D:** All right, yes, billions of years. You gotta predict that. And I think even the Buddha actually kind of say something similar. Not like he's literally say the sun will swallow out the earth, but he says the earth will be gone one day, some shit like that. And he even said the Dharma will be gone away too someday. 'Oh, this will be gone someday.' And so yeah, it's not— I think, oh yeah, I guess what I'm trying to say is people that's kind of, you know, ordinary people, there's this sort of idea that, you know, like, I don't know, like making the world to this way that they think it should be. And people that's well-practiced know that It's not going to be the way I think it should be. And it's relieving in a sense that all you could do is just shoot the arrow and look away. And you don't care if it hits or not. You just know the intention aligns with your action. Your action aligns with the wholesome nature. See what's going to happen. It's basically a cosmic joke, you know, like, yeah, try to maintain whatever you think the world should be. It's going to die one day. Everything is going to will be gone. But it's not like you're being nihilistic about it. I think that's what— that's the subtle difference. It's not like— I think some people have this very nihilistic outlook, and then they go into this feeling of helplessness, like, um, and yeah, yeah, and then you just continue with like this very weird toxic loophole, you know, keep feeling bad and then feeling helpless, feeling bad, feeling helpless, like, why bake the cake? And but then it's like you're realizing, oh, I can bake the cake and it's going to be messed up sometime and I could be happy with it either way. Of course it takes training sometimes. I'm not going to say it's going to be that way. I still catch myself. I think that's the funny thing. It's like a very— I catch myself having expectation, catching myself wanting it to be a certain way. But I think that's a good thing. I think this is why we— this is like every time I'm here listening to you guys, it always reminded me again and again that the reality of the things that it is. I think it's really beautiful to realize all this will be gone one day. I think it's beautiful to realize Anicca, Vajrayana, Sankhara, and nothing can be maintained to your liking, not for one second. And it's nice because every time I remember that, I just realize, oh my God, my action is the only thing I can control. And it's nice to just realize that again and again. I think my ego sometimes don't want to realize that, you know. And it's nice to just knock that peck out of the wood and realize this is just it.

**Speaker E:** Everything is temporary, so the future is nothing. And if the future is nothing, then what is left is the present.

**Speaker D:** Exactly.

**Speaker C:** And the present has to be good enough because it's all we've got.

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** This is why I keep coming back here. You guys made the point I forgot I was making. It's gorgeous.

**Speaker A:** Well, dudes, you guys are awesome. I'm gonna get going. You guys can feel free to stay and chat if you like. Much peace and love.

**Speaker E:** You're awesome, man.

**Speaker B:** Have a good night, Dhamma. Enjoy the babies.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, take care.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, that's a good one.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk centers on **Speaker B's distress over feeling they have lost a long-held skill (baking) after a simple failure (an underbaked cake)**. The conversation evolves into a broader exploration of attachment, self-worth, and the nature of practice. Here is a summary of the key themes and advice offered:

### **Core Issue & Initial Reaction**
*   Speaker B is upset because a failed box cake symbolizes the loss of skills they once had, leading to a feeling of inadequacy and a daunting prospect of "relearning 30 years of skills."
*   The initial reaction is one of identification with the failure: "I lost a skill."

### **Sangha's Advice & Dhamma Insights**
The group gently challenges this narrative, offering perspectives rooted in Dhamma practice:

1.  **Don't Catastrophize a Single Event:** The group immediately reframes the problem: one underbaked cake does not mean you are a failed baker. It's just one outcome. The solution is practical—"put it back in the oven" or try again.

2.  **Skills Are Impermanent (Anicca):** Skills, like all conditioned things, fade if not used. Forgetting is natural; the brain "overwrites" unused information. If you value the skill, you can relearn it through practice. If not, it's okay to let it go.

3.  **Attachment is the Source of Suffering:** The suffering arose not from the cake itself, but from **attachment**—to a self-image as a skilled person, to past capabilities, and to a specific desired outcome. Speaker C notes: "Suffering comes from the wanting... from wanting it to be a certain way."

4.  **The "Arrow" of Action:** Speaker A shares a Zen story about the archer who focuses only on the act of shooting, then turns away, unconcerned with where the arrow lands. Similarly, the point is to do your best mindfully and then let go of the result, which is out of your control.

5.  **Redefining "Good-For-Nothing":** The talk explores the radical freedom in releasing worldly identities and ambitions. Speaker A quotes Robert Adams: "you have to learn to be a good-for-nothing." This isn't nihilism, but a release from the pressure of having to *be* or *do* something specific to have value. True practice might mean being content "doing nothing."

6.  **The Present Moment is What Matters:** The past skill is gone; the future cake is uncertain. All you have is the present action. As Speaker E says, "all you have is right now. And all you can really do is take action right now." The goal is to find joy or mindfulness in the *process* of baking, not in the perfect result.

7.  **Self-Compassion & Normalizing Failure:** The group normalizes the experience. Speaker E emphasizes that having these attachments is "perfectly normal." The practice isn't about never having unwholesome thoughts, but about **recognizing and distancing yourself from them** when they arise. "No need to beat yourself up about beating yourself up."

### **Broader Application**
The conversation expands beyond baking to address:
*   **Engagement with the World:** The group discusses how "not concerning yourself with worldly affairs" is not an excuse for apathy, but advice to act from a place of wisdom and compassion without being consumed by attachment to results or "doom and gloom."
*   **The Nature of Reality:** They touch on the ultimate futility of trying to control an impermanent world, and the peace that comes from aligning your actions with wholesome intentions while accepting that outcomes are not in your control—a "cosmic joke."

### **Conclusion**
Speaker B moves from distress to acceptance, realizing their reaction was based on attachment to a past self and a story of loss. The talk reinforces core Buddhist principles: **non-attachment, impermanence, present-moment awareness, and self-compassion.** The final message is that your worth is not in your skills or outputs, but in your mindful intention and ability to be at peace with whatever arises.

**In essence:** The underbaked cake was not a problem until the mind created a story of loss and failure around it. The Dhamma solution is to release the story, engage fully with the present task, and be okay with whatever happens.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several key metaphors and stories to explore the themes of skill loss, attachment, practice, and acceptance. Here are the main ones:

### 1. **The "Underbaked Cake" as a Metaphor for Perceived Failure**
The entire conversation is sparked by Speaker B's distress over underbaking a cake—a concrete example that symbolizes a broader fear of losing hard-earned skills and identity. The cake becomes a stand-in for any skill or effort that doesn't meet one's own past standards or expectations.

### 2. **The Zen Archer Story**
Introduced by **Speaker A**, this is the most explicit story used:
> *"It's like that Zen story... of the archer, where the Japanese archers, the Zen archers, would just draw back their bow. Fire the arrow. They'd be very aware of what everything they were doing, but once the arrow left the bow, they would turn their back to it because they didn't care if it hit the mark because it was out of their control."*
*   **Meaning:** This story illustrates the principle of **non-attachment to results**. You control your effort and intention (mixing and baking the cake), but not the outcome (how the cake turns out). The practice is in doing your best and then letting go.

### 3. **The Muscle Memory / Gym Metaphor**
Introduced by **Speaker C**:
> *"Draw a correlation between like skills and like physical stuff. Like if you used to go to the gym and you worked your way up... then you don't go for ages... you can be disappointed... or you can be like, oh, that's just what happens when you don't use the muscles."*
*   **Meaning:** Skills—both physical and mental—are like muscles. They atrophy without practice, but they can be rebuilt with renewed practice. This normalizes the experience of skill loss and frames it as a natural process, not a personal failing.

### 4. **The "Good-for-Nothing" Metaphor**
Attributed to Robert Adams by **Speaker A**:
> *"Robert Adams used to say you have to learn to be a good-for-nothing. Just be a good-for-nothing nobody. It's okay."*
*   **Meaning:** This challenges the societal value of constant productivity and achievement. It suggests that worth is not tied to skills or output, and that there is peace and freedom in releasing the need to "be good at" things.

### 5. **The Story of Milarepa**
Also cited by **Speaker A**:
> *"Nobody thinks Jetsun Milarepa, the great Tibetan yogi, nobody thinks he was like this failure or something, you know. He sat in a cave doing nothing for like 10 years, 11 years, something."*
*   **Meaning:** This provides a spiritual and heroic example of how apparent "doing nothing" (deep meditation and spiritual practice) is not a waste or a loss of skill, but a profound and valid path. It reframes inactivity as a potential virtue.

### 6. **The "World on Fire" Metaphor**
Used by **Speaker A** in the broader discussion:
> *"You know, the world's kind of always been on fire... each generation thinks that their fire is the most important and most urgent."*
*   **Meaning:** This metaphor puts personal struggles (like a failed cake) into a larger perspective. It suggests that while engagement is good, becoming overly attached to fixing every problem leads to suffering. Effective action starts locally and mindfully, without being consumed by the endless "fires."

### 7. **The "Overwritten Brain" Analogy**
Used by **Speaker C**:
> *"If you don't do something for a while, it's normal that the brain just puts the information into overwrite and then writes over it with other stuff."*
*   **Meaning:** This computer-hard-drive analogy explains skill loss as a normal function of the brain prioritizing recent and frequent activities. The information isn't "lost" forever; it can be retrieved with practice, but it's natural for it to become less accessible.

### **Underlying Narrative Arc:**
The conversation itself follows a **story-like arc**:
1.  **The Crisis:** A failed cake leads to a story of "I've lost my skills and therefore part of my identity."
2.  **The Advice:** Friends offer metaphors (archer, gym) to reframe the crisis as normal and non-catastrophic.
3.  **The Philosophical Shift:** The group introduces deeper metaphors ("good-for-nothing," Milarepa) to challenge the very need for those skills and the attachment to a "skillful" identity.
4.  **The Resolution/Insight:** Speaker B moves from distress to understanding, realizing the attachment was to **past capability and a productive self-image**, not the cake itself. The group concludes with the broader metaphor of the **"world on fire"** to contextualize all personal struggles within the universal truths of impermanence and non-attachment.

In essence, the metaphors and stories collectively guide the discussion from a specific frustration toward universal Dharma principles: **impermanence (annica), non-attachment, right effort, and finding peace in the present moment regardless of outcome.**
