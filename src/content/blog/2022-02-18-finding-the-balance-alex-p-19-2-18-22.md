### Transcript


**Speaker A:** I stopped having this not caring attitude and start focusing on the satisfaction again, and deliberately bringing wholesome thoughts into the mind. But you see, that goes into direct contrast and conflict with the, oh, I'm just not going to care about it. Because the not caring about it was just not doing any of that stuff. Just looking at my monitor, my computer screen as I'm working. That's it. Any unwholesome thought that showed up is like, oh, it's okay. I'm not going to care. That's fine. I don't care about it. But after a while, what I'm saying is that it seemed like I had to deliberately practice again. Not caring about it was too weak. It wasn't— I needed to put a stronger hold and focus on deliberately bringing wholesome thoughts into the mind, or I was going to drown, so to speak, and the Dukkha. Does that make sense?

**Speaker B:** It not only makes sense, but that's not an uncommon way of saying it. Okay, so now that you're drowning in Dukkha again, or about to drown, We make then that determination that, hey, maybe I shouldn't let things get that far. But here's something that happened, okay, that you didn't put in there. So let's fill in some gaps. And that was, is that you were having an occasional, let's just say, unwholesome thought, and then perhaps they got a little bit more frequent. But it was okay and your attitude for these were fine. But there came a point, maybe in a buildup of what happened, that you then changed your attitude about the thoughts and says, oh, this is too much, or these thoughts are bad.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Or that I should— I should probably not relax as much as I am right now. I got to stay on top of it and stay— well, wait a minute.

**Speaker B:** You're missing the whole point about relaxation.

**Speaker A:** Okay, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** And actually what happened was, is then you became at that point in time not relaxed. Yeah. Okay, exactly.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right. And now you're saying that you've got to get back on top of it in that moment?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right. Okay. And that getting back on top of it, is that relaxation or not?

**Speaker A:** No.

**Speaker B:** All right, so let's say the next time that you feel overwhelmed with it, we can say, oh well, I did Never Mind a while and it worked. Let me do another Never Mind that works. But there was something that happened that you changed.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there was a— yeah, it was a fear that if I kept going down that I don't care, I'm relaxing, road, I'm going to basically shoot myself in the foot. Like, I need to pay attention. I need to keep watching.

**Speaker B:** What about— what about ism?

**Speaker A:** Okay, I need to keep watch on the mind. That's what came up.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Okay. All right. And there you're with me now.

**Speaker A:** You know what I'm saying?

**Speaker B:** Well, I've been with you long before you thought that I was with you. I know exactly how the mind works. I've been working with a lot a lot of minds and they're all the same. No, yeah, I want to work exactly the same.

**Speaker A:** I get that. That's awesome. I just want to like— I want to ask you, did it help for me to share what I shared that you didn't want me to share in the beginning?

**Speaker B:** Actually, if you had listened to what I was saying, it was exactly the same thing that I was saying when you wanted to get all of this off your chest. And now that you've gotten it off your chest, what we're doing is using the language, etc., that you were using so that we can go back and look at that point in time when you made a shift from being satisfied and relaxed into, oh no, this is getting too much. I've got to get back to work. I've got to go. I got to go practice now. Okay. All right. Yeah, that's a 2, 3, 4. You got to do it kind of parental rule that came in when a little bit of fear— wait a minute, a rule came in when a little bit of fear came up.

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yep, that's exactly what happened.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yes. So you set a new— so you decided instead of when that fear came up just to relax, you decide, oh, the fear is there, therefore I've got to go follow some rule.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and I also want to include this. It was also that the little, like, the satisfaction that was there from just relaxing wasn't as profound or prominent as the satisfaction is when I'm doing deliberate practice and keeping watch.

**Speaker B:** So there you are comparing one satisfaction with another.

**Speaker A:** Thinking it's a problem. Yep, thinking there's a problem there. Yeah, which is the dissatisfaction again, and thinking it has something to do with following or not following those rules.

**Speaker B:** Being unsatisfied with satisfaction, that's a real face slapper there. Okay, and this is what we do, remember? A little dab will do you. And here you are thinking that one is better than the other, back to the judgmental mind rather than the nurturing mind. Oh, well, this is enough. Everything's okay. Relax. And so that's the applied and sustained quality of it, that you can sustain it for a little while and then an unwholesome thought will come up and you let it go, and then another little thought will come up and you let it go, and then they get more frequent. And you keep letting them go as they come up. How long are you going to continue to let them go and you still come back and relax until you say, wait a minute, we got to have a rule here. We got to stop all of this stuff. I got to work harder. Where in fact, you're actually doing the very best part of the practice, and that is, is that whenever an unwholesome thought comes up, you're on it and say, never mind, I can relax.

**Speaker A:** Really?

**Speaker B:** And this is actually following the Eightfold Noble Path, to wake up to that unwholesome thought, recognizes that, oh well, that is an unwholesome thought. And then you can say, well, never mind, I can just relax, which is taking the— finally the right effort. Rather than taking the effort, I've got to get on top of this, now you're taking the right effort to just relax. I can.

**Speaker A:** Like Dan describes it as like dropping it. Just drop it.

**Speaker B:** Just drop it.

**Speaker A:** You're holding on to something, just drop it.

**Speaker B:** Just drop it. There's no problem. Just let it go. Just drop it. I'm back in the back. And even if you seem that you have to drop it and drop it and drop it and drop it, very much like— in fact, a good example of that would be taking ticks off of a dog. Yeah, and the more you look, the more there are. Yes, but the dog will be patient and he'll sit there if you keep picking ticks and picking ticks. It may take you days and days and days to pick ticks, but eventually you get them all. And not only that, but you get really good at them. Now you're finding ticks hiding in places that you didn't even know to look before because the ticks were too easy to find. Okay, but now we're having to look all kinds of places where they're hiding. So this is, this is a, um, an example of it. Um, these unwholesome thoughts are kind of like ticks on a dog. There seems to be no end to them.

**Speaker A:** Dan also said that it's kind of like a balance. It's a balance that you kind of have to find. Sure, it's just the right amount of effort that's required in the moment.

**Speaker B:** Precisely so. The Buddha talked about that. It's called the middle path.

**Speaker A:** So that's what I'm confused about, right?

**Speaker B:** Because when I— Why do you get confused? Okay, I'm confused. Never mind.

**Speaker A:** Because when I relax, then I question, well, was that the right effort? Because it keeps coming back. So how do I know? Like, what's the right effort in the moment to clean out the mind?

**Speaker B:** In the moment. Okay. When you threw it out and relaxed, that was the right effort. When it came back, Now you're questioning, was the old effort the right effort, rather than just doing it again?

**Speaker A:** Oh man, this is nuts, dude. I, I'm so sick of this. I'm so sick of all of it.

**Speaker B:** Listen to that unwholesome thought. Listen to that unwholesome thought. I'm so sick of this, where in fact you just keep confusing yourself when it's actually quite simple. It's so simple, but you have to keep doing it over and over and over and over and over again, including the doing it is to stop doing stuff. The relaxing, yeah, right. You have to over and over and over again stop doing stuff. So stop being dissatisfied. Yeah, and unwholesome thoughts there. So what if you have that? You just had a new wholesome thought. That's exactly the same thing as the Buddha saying, aha, I see you, Mara. 'Oh, never mind.' But if you follow that thought and have it over and over and over and over and over again without waking up to it, then you start to feel bad.

**Speaker A:** That's the other thing. I had anxiety today too, so I was concerned that I need to be more on top of it.

**Speaker B:** Well, the way to be on top of anxiety is by breathing and relaxing.

**Speaker A:** Oh, Dhammarato, I, I'm so— that's so frustrating.

**Speaker B:** I know you keep bringing rules back in where in fact all we really are teaching here is relaxation, that in fact that's exactly what the Buddha is talking about. And it's all that whole point about relaxation. An example is to relax the body. And when we're worried, or when we want to fix something, or when we're dissatisfied, we're tense and uptight. And when we're satisfied, we're relaxed. That relaxation of the body is often associated with the first Jhana. But the body can't relax until the mind is relaxed, because the mind is the forerunner for everything. The thing that makes your body tense and uptight and anxious is the mind.

**Speaker A:** So is there something else that I need to do to make the mind relax, or just saying, 'Ah, relax,' that reminder is sufficient?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, if you are skilled at it, that's sufficient enough.

**Speaker A:** Well, how do I know? How do I know?

**Speaker B:** Why do you keep wanting to know? Why can't you be satisfied with not knowing?

**Speaker A:** How do I know if I'm skilled enough? I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do.

**Speaker B:** I know you keep asking that stupid question when we keep saying, well, if you don't know what to do, don't do anything at all. You're keeping wanting to do stuff, and we're saying wake up to all of those thoughts of wanting to do stuff. Both Dan and I are saying wake up to those thoughts of that you want to do stuff. Finding some excuse to do something, and instead just take a deep breath and do nothing.

**Speaker A:** I wish I didn't care about this so much.

**Speaker B:** I know, stop caring so much. Just relax. Let the Dhamma take care of you. You stop trying to take care of the Dhamma. Give up control, babe. You don't have to have the handle on it. You got to turn your handle off and let it go and just enjoy the show. I guess— Don't guess, just relax.

**Speaker A:** Take a deep breath and just— The thing that is most confusing here is the effort and the things that we were talking about 3 weeks ago are different than now. The things that you were telling me to do or that I was doing 3 weeks ago are different than now. And the joy that I'm experiencing now just from relaxing is more calmed down. It's very different from 3 weeks ago. And so I just don't know which one is right, which one is correct, which one I should do, which one I shouldn't do. I know there's no should.

**Speaker B:** You have many moments of time. You can choose one and then the other, happily satisfied, instead of saying, what should I do? Stop making this a job and start making it a toy to play with.

**Speaker A:** Do I need to smile as big as I've been smiling? I just, I don't get it anymore. I just, I feel like it's all, it's all collapsing. It's all coming down. And I like, I can't see.

**Speaker B:** Oh, those are unwholesome thoughts. Look at those unwholesome thoughts. It's also happening. You're, you're making lots of progress. Why are you giving yourself so many of these same old unwholesome thoughts of that this is going nowhere and I'm confused?

**Speaker A:** Well, Okay, all right, I hear that. If I'm making lots of progress, why doesn't it feel like it?

**Speaker B:** Because you talk yourself back out of it, and then you're not making progress. And I want you to look up, wake up to that. Wake up to the fact that even when you're feeling good, you decide to let the unwholesome thoughts take over again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay.

**Speaker B:** And so you're back into it again.

**Speaker A:** It's like that analogy that you told me about yesterday with the car. Like the guy wants the car before he has the car. And then when he has the car, he still wants the car. And then when the car is gone, he still wants the car. And that's how it is with the satisfaction. Like if I feel even if I feel good, I still want to feel good. And then when I'm not feeling good, I still want to feel good. When I'm not feeling good, I want to feel good. When I'm feeling good, I want to feel good. And when I'm not feeling good anymore, I want to feel good.

**Speaker B:** That's right. And you're judging how you do feel and saying that ain't good enough.

**Speaker A:** Well, yeah, and I guess— okay, okay, so I think this is where the confusion stems from. If I relax, right? If I'm just saying, I'm worried that I need to, you know, have some more wholesome thoughts right now. Okay, I don't care about that. I'm just going to relax. I just don't care. I'm just going to relax.

**Speaker B:** Right? If I'm saying that— Those are wholesome thoughts, by the way. Those are not unwholesome thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, those are wholesome thoughts, right? And then, oh, I was gonna say, if I don't start, if I don't start having more satisfaction and more joy, then that's an indicator that something is wrong.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** Or I'm doing something incorrectly. I'm doing incorrect practice.

**Speaker B:** What do you mean doing again? I'm confused. Back up a paragraph or so and tell me again.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so if I just say I don't care, right? I'm going to relax when an unwholesome thought comes up.

**Speaker B:** And you're not doing much of anything, right? I got it. You're right.

**Speaker A:** And then if I don't start to have like more joy or more satisfaction, it doesn't start compounding or getting bigger, right? Which is usually what happens.

**Speaker B:** Well, not so.

**Speaker A:** Is it wrong? Is it incorrect practice?

**Speaker B:** It is as soon as you have that thought, because that's not a satisfying thought. Being satisfied with a little bit, a little dab will do you, and when the dab grows, you keep wanting it to grow instead of just allowing it to be exactly where it is. You've already got a little dab.

**Speaker A:** My God, man.

**Speaker B:** And you keep wanting more, more and more and more and more.

**Speaker A:** So what if I don't? What if I don't have a little dab? What if I don't have a little dab?

**Speaker B:** Be satisfied that you don't have a little dab. And that's a little dab. It is. Be satisfied that you don't have what you want. Because otherwise you will continue to want things and feel bad, and you'll not make any progress.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Okay. Be satisfied that I don't have what I want. That's an interesting one. Be satisfied that I don't have what I want.

**Speaker B:** Precisely. Because what you want and don't have is Dukkha itself. And so you have to go through the process of being satisfied that you're not getting what you want. And instead come back to the point of saying, I like it, but I can do without it right now.

**Speaker A:** I like satisfaction, but I can do without it right now.

**Speaker B:** Right now. And isn't that satisfying?

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay. I appreciate it, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** I'm, I'm, I'm here.

**Speaker A:** I'm here.

**Speaker B:** And you're making it so hard, and you can make it easy by just saying, really, this is easy, there's nothing to it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So if the keyword today is be satisfied that you don't get what you want— satisfied that I don't get what I want.

**Speaker A:** I could see that, like, I can really, like, I can really, like, play around with that, like, okay, I don't get what I want, so now I can just be satisfied.

**Speaker B:** Great.

**Speaker A:** I'm not going to get what I want. That's okay.

**Speaker B:** This is resolved. Well, actually, in a way, you could say that is The entire teaching of the Buddha right there, because we're touching on the Second Noble Truth, wanting things and we don't have them but we want them anyway. So there's ignorance, and then we don't like that we don't have it. And so the whole Second Noble Truth is all built into the package. And so we can see there's the sequence with Paticcasamuppada, that I like it, therefore I want it. And if I want it, I got to do something. And that's the clinging. And now we wind up in a bad state or a woeful state of having the Dukkha of not getting what we want.

**Speaker A:** That's exactly what happens. Yeah. When I'm— yeah, exactly.

**Speaker B:** Over and over and over and over and over again, it happens.

**Speaker A:** So when I'm relaxing, when I'm relaxing and I say I don't care, and then an unwholesome thought comes up and I think I need to have more satisfaction than I have right now. I'm thinking I want it, so I gotta do something, and then I come out of that relaxation instead of just going back into relaxing and having another thought of, well, I don't care. Oh, that's fine. I don't care about that.

**Speaker B:** I don't care. I don't get what I want.

**Speaker A:** I can do this. I can do that. I can do that. I think I can do that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's, that's what makes it really easy, is that you're just not going to get what you want.

**Speaker A:** That's okay.

**Speaker B:** And our whole society has been training us that when we don't get what we want, we got to strive and try hard and work on it and lie and paniggle and do what we can with great bad feelings sometimes and hurt a lot of people along the way in order to get what we want. And then we'll be satisfied. And it don't work like that. That's the mistake. That's all ignorance. When we recognize, oh, I can be satisfied without getting what I want, and then I can just merely like and appreciate or just watch the show rather than trying to be the director of the show. Okay, just let it happen. Okay, let it go. I don't get what I want.

**Speaker A:** Sounds like a great relief, honestly.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, and think about it like this, is that the rules that we have are the guidelines about telling you what you should want.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, like I have to want something and I have to be dissatisfied if I don't get it, when there's just a stupid rule. But really, I can just be satisfied that I don't get what I want.

**Speaker B:** Precisely so. That's the Third Noble Truth right there.

**Speaker A:** I can adopt that like a real view.

**Speaker B:** To everyone. Yeah, it becomes almost a worldview. Yeah. Or certainly the meaning of the attitude of, hey, I can handle this, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, of course you can handle anything because you don't have anything.

**Speaker B:** Because I don't get what I want and I'm satisfied, so I can handle that too, right?

**Speaker A:** No worries. That's where the no worries comes from.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And so even if like, so I'm getting, I'm guessing like where this is going is even if I'm on cloud nine, or if I'm feeling okay, right? Or, oh, this is good. Any range of those. How about it doesn't matter? Yeah, it doesn't matter.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, like, I'm stove up in the hospital in a great big cast that goes from here to there, right? I've been there, done that. And the answer is, is that, well, at least I don't have to go anyplace. I can just lay here.

**Speaker A:** So we don't So we don't have to feel good all the time?

**Speaker B:** No, but you can be satisfied that there is pain. And in fact, one of the satisfactions is, is that I can handle this— what, pain? All I have to do is lay still and it doesn't hurt.

**Speaker A:** So then why did we talk so heavily in the beginning about getting into a good state? And staying in that good state.

**Speaker B:** Isn't relaxation a good state?

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay, there's a goodness to it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. But there is a buildup into the relaxation. You've got to have the success, you've got to have that satisfaction.

**Speaker A:** And you're saying that comes from just continuing to say, oh, I don't care, I'm relaxing from that.

**Speaker B:** I don't get what I want, I don't care.

**Speaker A:** I don't get what I want and I'm satisfied anyway. Okay, that's kind of cool. I'll try that out.

**Speaker B:** That's something to remember. That's a very wholesome thought. Very, very wholesome thought indeed. This is a bit— oh, it's okay, I don't get what I want.

**Speaker A:** Oh, it's okay, I don't get what I want. I can be satisfied even if I don't get what I want. I don't get what I want, but I can be satisfied with that.

**Speaker B:** And when we have that attitude and say that often, we begin to get much more discriminating about what it is that we want, much more careful about what is it that's worth wanting.

**Speaker A:** Which I'm not sure if there's really anything worth wanting.

**Speaker B:** Ah, but before, in the ordinary mind state, we'll try anything. Yeah, you get relaxed, you know, that trying, and we don't get it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, no, I mean, I can see clearly that whenever— I mean, to some degree, whenever there's wanting, there's Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** So going back to that story of Dostoevsky is that the axe murderer desperately wanted something, like he didn't want to get caught. If he did want to get caught, he would have confessed to the police, but he confessed to the girlfriend because he felt so desperate. That would be the question. Have you ever heard of Henry David Thoreau saying that men live lives of quiet desperation?

**Speaker A:** No, actually, yeah, I think I have heard that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So the question is, is that when does our desperation get noisy? Like, for instance, the girlfriend wanting to vent. So when we want— when we want more— when we want something is being desperate, and when we get noisy about it is when that's the grasping and clinging going into the vocal states.

**Speaker A:** In what states?

**Speaker B:** Woeful.

**Speaker A:** Woeful.

**Speaker B:** Hell itself. The Hungry Ghost. The one that is most common in the West, the dumb animal going along to get along, but we don't like it. Doing what we're told to do, expecting a reward in the future. But not getting our rewards now. And then the fourth one is the Asura, which are the, let us say, the magical and heavenly warriors who are all dressed up for battle but are afraid to go into battle. That's the fear. So you can see anger and frustration is hell, wanting something we don't have, going along to get along and doing what we're told to do. Or being afraid to do what we need to do. Those are the four awful states.

**Speaker A:** Going along to get along. Say them again, please.

**Speaker B:** The animal going along to get along, just like a domesticated animal. The example is the horse is hooked to a plow with a harness, and now he has to plow up his delicious pasture. And after he's done the work of plowing up his delicious pasture, then the farmer plants the food that the farmer wants to eat, not the stuff that the horse wants. That's an example of a dumb animal. And we start being dumb animals in, uh, first grade or preschool.

**Speaker A:** What are the other ones?

**Speaker B:** Fear, stage fright, not standing up, going along with someone who is doing the wrong thing, harming other people, but he's your friend, so you protect him. And when somebody attacks him, you stand in the way because of your fear. Okay. And so we often don't do the right thing because of fear. Not popular. I mean, a lot of our culture is unwholesome. And so sometimes we have to get over our fear of not getting along or not going along. And standing up and doing the right thing. So all of that's built right into the teaching of the Buddha. But all of it has to do with— we don't go into any of those states when we're relaxed. Oh, I don't care about any of that stuff. I don't have to be angry right now. I don't have to want things I don't have.

**Speaker A:** I don't have to want things.

**Speaker B:** I don't have to do what I'm told to do.

**Speaker A:** I don't have to do what I'm told to do.

**Speaker B:** Wow, that is so beautiful. I do not have to do what I am told.

**Speaker A:** I don't have to be upset right now. I don't have to be irritated. I don't have to be afraid. I don't have to have anxiety. So I can say those things too. And that is— it's kind of with the attitude of relaxation, with the attitude of I don't care about it.

**Speaker B:** Don't care about any of that stuff. Now we can finally really enjoy the show instead of calling people down for one thing or another.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's kind of really like letting go of my life as I know it.

**Speaker B:** Uh-huh. Yeah, your choice. When you recognize the life as you know it is actually quite painful every time you get into it. Yeah, then you can stay out of it and just relax instead.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, it is like the life that I know is based in wanting and pain and Dukkha and not getting what I want. I just saw something. You said, I think the reason maybe why wanting happens is because we think that we need that thing that we want in order to be satisfied.

**Speaker B:** Oh, you mean why?

**Speaker A:** Or survive. Yeah. So in wanting is this belief that— belief that we need that.

**Speaker B:** That's the delusion, is when wanting becomes needing. That's major delusion. A lot of people can't tell the difference.

**Speaker A:** Does wanting become needing, or is needing the same thing as wanting?

**Speaker B:** Well, they're basically in the Pali, it's Tanha, the thirst, or being thirsty, or actually wanting water, versus Upadana, of the grasping or clinging. I need it. I'm desperate. I've got to have it. And we go from one to the other very easily because we can't tell the difference between I just want it and I need it. Like, a lot of people practice meditation because they need it, and then they don't get much out of it because they're practicing being in a state of need. And so we can see that, that we don't need things, that we just want it. Then we recognize, oh, it's just, uh, that I I want it. It's that I made some sort of trick because really the idea is that I just like it. If I just enjoy the show rather than having to grab that show and own it. But it ain't mine. Doesn't belong to me. Not my business.

**Speaker A:** One unwholesome thought that comes up is once I realize that my body is tense, I then, once I see it, I'm like, oh great, I can just relax from that. But then the next unwholesome— Yeah. The next unwholesome thought that will show up is like, is, oh man, you have to keep doing this. It sucks that you have to keep doing this back and forth. And that's just another one I can let go of. Right? Like, oh, I don't care about that either. That's fine.

**Speaker B:** That's a common occurrence for you as you get good and then you say, oh, I don't want to keep doing this.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so Dan and I, we wiggle around. Okay, we'll go for relaxation, you know, and we're just trying to chase you around this rabbit hole.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** But everybody goes through all of that. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Did Dan go through this too?

**Speaker B:** Big time. And much slower and much harder than you.

**Speaker A:** Can you tell me about it, please? A little bit?

**Speaker B:** Oh, it's his business. You go ask him.

**Speaker A:** No, he told me. He told me to ask you. He said for you to tell me. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay. All right. So that puts you into a big Catch-22 jam, doesn't it?

**Speaker A:** Oh, he said it would be fine.

**Speaker B:** Would you be satisfied if I didn't tell you? I would.

**Speaker A:** I could be satisfied that I don't get what I want. No problem.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, that was a test point. Just testing.

**Speaker A:** I had a feeling you were doing that too. I'm in sales, so I, you know, I knew it from that angle. But I really am being honest. I, I can be satisfied without getting what I want.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, look at that. Yeah, let's just say that we all go through the same stuff. We all do.

**Speaker A:** So can you tell me one story?

**Speaker B:** He took a retreat here in Thailand that he was not ready to go into because he had just come from England and he hadn't settled down enough.

**Speaker A:** Wait, wait, he told me— you told me this story already. Tell me a different one. He told me that too. I've heard that before.

**Speaker B:** Nah. Um, some of the stuff that he had to work through was the distinction between teaching the Dharma and teaching drums, because I don't see any difference. Because he spent a lot of time teaching the Dharma to his drum students who didn't want drumming at all. What they wanted was to not be there, but Mom had signed him up for drum lessons. This was before COVID Then he did it online for a long time and that kind of stuff. But in the beginning, that was something that he had to work through. In other words, it actually changed his entire style of teaching, because he thought that he was teaching drums. Therefore, his responsibility is to teach drums. When he began to understand it, no, his job is to make friends with these young students. That I begin to teach that to everyone, that I have talked that to people who work in office. Your job in that office is to not do the paperwork that you normally think that you were hired to do. Your job is to be friends with everybody in the office. So that's something that got started with Dan, is to change our reference when we're in public, that we think that we're there to do a job. But the thing that's really amazing is, is that if you've got someone who is an absolute do-nothing, but he is the best friend of the boss, then he's unlikely to get fired. So performance is really not that important. Relationships are important. Okay. And many, many corporations have tried to change that over the centuries. A good example of that would be IBM, when they want to do everything as merit-based. And then T.J. Watson Jr. is trained in Rochester, Minnesota, only to become the daddy's replacement. But meanwhile, they talk about merit systems. In other words, we promote not by who you know, but what you know. Have you ever heard that? And that's what sells really, really big time in the West. It's not who you know, it's what you know. The answer is no, man. That's never been the case and never will be. It's always who you know, not what you know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, they say that.

**Speaker B:** Years to figure that out because we were so trained the other way.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you mentioned that it was slower and harder for Dan. Can you tell me a little bit about that?

**Speaker B:** Well, he persevered. He stayed with it. Many of the talks we had didn't happen. But in fact, I would say that probably the first video that we ever did was done with Dan and I. That was done— when I say a video, we're talking about after Skype started to do them in 2018. So all of 2017 was when Dan and I talked a lot.

**Speaker A:** Do you have recordings of you and Dan talking on Skype?

**Speaker B:** Dozens.

**Speaker A:** Oh wow, back in 2018?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, starting in 2018, October 2018 forward.

**Speaker A:** Oh hell yeah, I'm gonna watch some of them. That'll be great to see. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** So if you watch those videos, then you know as much about him as I do.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** If you observe.

**Speaker A:** No, a lot of times what he says when I'm telling him what I'm experiencing or going through, if it's particularly challenging, he'll be like, I remember it well. That's what he says. I remember it well. But he doesn't have that now. He doesn't have any of that going on now.

**Speaker B:** Well, look at that. That will give you inspiration that if Dan can do it with me in 5 years, you could do it too. I mean, what do you want to do in 5 years? Be miserable and controlling and uptight and Oh yeah, no, you're willing to go through this process?

**Speaker A:** I am more than inspired, for sure. I— yeah, there's no question of my dedication to the Dharma.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's the real sales job, but that's the real sales job in anything. I mean, even if the Three Stooges walk into the new producer's office and they're trying to sell him to get them to make a new picture, what they've really got to sell is themselves. They've got to be the comedians right there in front of them. They can't come in as businessmen or salespeople to sell their movie. They've got to come in and be the movie.

**Speaker A:** I said there's no question of my dedication to the Dharma, and you said that's the real sales talk right there. What do you mean?

**Speaker B:** Well, basically, yes, that You can think of it as— and it's referred to as the spark of the Dharma. This is what lineage is all about, that you cannot pick up nobility out of a book. It's got to be picked up from nobles. You can get information out of a book, but then all that information winds up being confusing sometimes. Okay, so a book won't do it. You can't, you can't do Dharma in a book. It's got to be done on a one-by-one. It can't be done in a meditation hall with 100 students in the hall.

**Speaker A:** You're saying though that the Dhamma is what sells this?

**Speaker B:** Well, that's what I'm doing, is I'm selling Dhamma. And I get paid handsomely.

**Speaker A:** I would really like to be able to talk to some of the prospects that I call throughout the day in a way that is just like how you and Arahant are talking, but it's just not possible right now.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it is. The question is, even though you've got a stick or a spiel to read, When you read it, you can either read it as a news announcer, or you can read it as a salesman, or you can read it as his best friend. And that's also part of the job, is to do a bit of confrontation, to set you up. Just like you recognize that they do set people up in the sales. I've set you up 4 or 5 times in this talk. One was when you wanted to know what Dan was all about. But you also, if you go back to the very early part of the call, I think even before it was recorded, was when you insisted on telling me a story and I didn't want to hear it. But that's what led you to the breakthrough of recognizing that you became frustrated because you couldn't get what you wanted. And what you wanted to do was to tell the story. Now you can see that, oh, I can be satisfied and still not get what I want.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So you see how sneaky I am?

**Speaker A:** Slippery little eel. Yeah. Good job.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. Devoted over the— or developed over the years, rather. Called wisdom, actually, to be able to set you up so that you can see, which is exactly what we can do one-on-one. And if you were sitting in the back of a meditation hall listening to a Dhamma talk, you could not get set up like that.

**Speaker A:** I like what you said about talking to them like they're my best friend.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** You know, the only thing with that is that sometimes when I'm like really kind to them, they cut me off, they hang up the phone.

**Speaker B:** So sometimes it's like, figure that out, won't you?

**Speaker A:** I got to be more like curt, aggressive with them sometimes.

**Speaker B:** Well, you'll work that out. That's a skill to be developed, selling things you don't buy.

**Speaker A:** Selling things I don't buy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I don't even know what it is that your company sells, but you probably don't have a house full of it for your own use.

**Speaker A:** No.

**Speaker B:** Well, you see, I'm selling something. Yeah, that I spent years buying into.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, nothing I can do about that though.

**Speaker B:** No, except that you need to know that.

**Speaker A:** Mhm.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that'll help you flavor your talks, knowing that you can't do it. This really is just an attitude change, and the attitude change is, I can handle this. I can— I'm completely satisfied even if I don't get what I want. So that they hang up on you. So what did that mean? That you've already come to the end of your telephone book and there's no more leads to call?

**Speaker A:** No.

**Speaker B:** If that's the case, if that's the case, then yippee, we're finished with all of this. Even if the last call hung up on me, at least it's finished now.

**Speaker A:** No, no, not at all. I'm actually, to be honest with you, I was talking with Abby tonight and I just told her, I was like, we really I'm so hard on myself. I have the most sales in the company right now. But I still think I'm not doing good enough.

**Speaker B:** Well, now you know that you've been hard on yourself. I've seen it from day one. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And the thing is, is I actually, I noticed it's comfortable to be hard on myself. It's familiar.

**Speaker B:** You got used to it. It's familiar.

**Speaker A:** Got used to it. Yeah, and I'm, and I'm, and I'm scared.

**Speaker B:** I told you, but now you're learning that you can relax and enjoy that. Then you recognize you've got a choice. You can either be hard on yourself or you can relax. The surprise is, is that you gained a whole bunch of skills while you were being hard on yourself, and when you stop being hard on yourself, you still have all of those skills. So now you can play with them and have it because you're not hard on yourself anymore. Now you can treat your job and your girlfriend and moment by moment, it's just a new toy to play with.

**Speaker A:** It's crazy, like there's, there's nothing that can be a problem if I can just be satisfied with things because I'm not getting them.

**Speaker B:** Because you're not getting what you want. And I can be satisfied with not getting what I want.

**Speaker A:** And I can be satisfied that I'm not satisfied with getting what— uh, not getting what I want.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that, that's a trick. But yes, that's right. Even though you can't get what you want, you can be satisfied anyway.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** It really is that easy.

**Speaker A:** Now, do I still need to keep deliberately bringing— No, no, no, no, no thoughts.

**Speaker B:** You just come back with another wholesome thought right there rather than a question.

**Speaker A:** I don't need to do that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you don't need those questions. You're satisfied without getting the questions answered. Okay, but then when, when, when, when, when you already know enough, you already know enough. There is nothing new that you need to know. You've got everything you need.

**Speaker A:** But I'm just curious though, when the thought comes up, oh, that, like, do I have to say to myself, this feels good, oh, I like this, or I'm enjoying this, Or can I just— there's no end of the unwholesome thoughts.

**Speaker B:** The only distinction is, is that there's a whole lot more unwholesome thoughts, but there's no end of the wholesome thoughts. Oh, but, but just thoughts randomly going around, most of the thoughts that just happen are unwholesome thoughts, right?

**Speaker A:** What if there's that gap though?

**Speaker B:** If there's that gap, is— do I need to keep bringing— the question is, well, the question about the gap is, is that when a new thought comes, is the new thought going to be wholesome or unwholesome? Remember that story of the life of Brian? Okay, right. So that's the question, is, is that if this new thought— never mind what's happened in the past, the past is already gone. We can give any possible story you want to about the past. The question is not about the past and what's been happening up until now. Doesn't matter how many years I've been sitting and squatting on the ground, being silent. Brian just fell on me. How am I going to react to that? I have a choice of either reacting wholesomely or unwholesomely. If I don't like that he fell on me, then you can be satisfied with that. I could be satisfied with that. In fact, here's the whole point, is that when we are strong enough to resist the Dukkha, then we are satisfied that we're strong enough to resist it. So if Brian had fallen right on him and he just sat right there, he could have smiled, smirked, and says, hey, I can handle even Brian jumping on.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's, that's kind of what happens when I say, oh, I don't care about that, because I, I've built like a wall.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. So what if Brian just fell on me? I'm okay. Okay, yeah, that's the way that we're going to do it, is that whenever something bad happens, the question is how are we going to handle it? Are we going to be awake right then, right, so that we can dodge it, right? Dodging it is, oh, that I don't care, that's fine, right? So in the case of Brian falling on the, uh, uh, the Rishi's body, but Brian didn't fall on the Rishi himself.

**Speaker A:** Who's Rishi?

**Speaker B:** Okay, uh, in Thai is Ruci. Have you ever heard of the Rishikesh Express? Another word for aesthetic, and that would be a good word for it. Okay, so you could— wandering aesthetic, you could call it a feel Jesus. I don't know what to call them. Okay, maybe you can call them a monk or an aesthetic or a rishi, Bhikkhu, a renunciate, a mendicant. A bunch of words. Okay. But when they've got beards, they normally are in the class of Rishi.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Okay.

**Speaker B:** And so, uh, a brand fell on the body of the Rishi, didn't fall on the Rishi himself. So when these thoughts come, these unwholesome thoughts that come, they come into the mind but not into you. Because you're not the mind. The mind's just there. They are okay. That's all. Never mind, just in the mind. So no matter what's happened in the past, doesn't matter how long we sat there, when something befalls us, are we going to wake up to work, uh, to handle that well? Are we going to not like it? I And if we don't like it, are we going to not like it wisely?

**Speaker A:** Right. Meaning, oh, that's okay. I can be satisfied with not getting what I wanted there. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Cool.

**Speaker A:** All right. I'm excited to try this out.

**Speaker B:** The excitement won't last either.

**Speaker A:** And that's fine. That's okay.

**Speaker B:** Okay, Alex, we'll see you. Okay, leave them laughing. All right, see you later.

**Speaker A:** Okay, bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) with a student (Speaker A), centers on a common struggle in meditation practice: the tension between **deliberate effort** and **effortless relaxation**, and how to skillfully deal with recurring unwholesome thoughts.

Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Dilemma**
The student describes shifting from a successful, relaxed "don't care" attitude—where he would notice unwholesome thoughts and simply let them go—to feeling he needed to return to **deliberate, forceful practice** (e.g., actively generating wholesome thoughts) to avoid being overwhelmed by dissatisfaction (*dukkha*).

### **Dhammarato's Guidance: The Middle Way of Relaxation**
Dhammarato identifies the critical moment where the problem began: **the student switched from relaxation to a rule-based, fearful effort.**

1.  **The Mistake:** When unwholesome thoughts increased, the student interpreted it as a sign that his relaxed "never mind" approach was failing. Fear arose ("I'm going to drown"), and he imposed a strict, tense rule on himself: "I must get back on top of this and practice harder." This **tense striving itself became the problem**, pulling him out of the relaxed, satisfied state.

2.  **The "Don't Care" Attitude is the Practice:** Dhammarato reframes the student's initial "don't care" approach not as laziness, but as **precisely the correct practice of Right Effort**. The sequence is:
    *   **Wake up** to the unwholesome thought.
    *   **Recognize** it as unwholesome.
    *   **Let it go / drop it / say "never mind."**
    *   **Return to relaxation and satisfaction.**
    This must be done repeatedly, like "picking ticks off a dog"—it's simple but requires persistent, gentle application.

3.  **The Key Insight: Be Satisfied Without Getting What You Want**
    The student's underlying issue is **wanting**—wanting a specific type of satisfaction, wanting progress, wanting to feel good all the time. Dhammarato offers the pivotal instruction:
    > **"Be satisfied that you don't get what you want."**
    This directly addresses the Second Noble Truth (the cause of *dukkha* is craving). By finding satisfaction even in the absence of desired states (like intense joy or a quiet mind), one severs the link between craving and suffering. This attitude is framed as the essence of the Third Noble Truth (cessation of *dukkha*).

4.  **Practical Application:**
    *   **When any unwholesome thought arises** (anxiety, frustration, fear, the thought "I must do something"), the response is the same: notice it and relax.
    *   **Use the phrase:** "I don't care about that. I can be satisfied even without getting what I want."
    *   **This applies to all "woeful states" (hell realms):** "I don't have to be angry. I don't have to want what I don't have. I don't have to do what I'm told. I don't have to be afraid."
    *   **The goal is not to feel good constantly**, but to be **satisfied and relaxed** with whatever is present, even pain or a lack of joy.

### **Conclusion: From Striving to Playful Ease**
The talk concludes by emphasizing that the entire path is about **relaxation**. The mind leads, so a relaxed mind leads to a relaxed body and peaceful experience. The student's self-criticism and hard striving are familiar but unnecessary habits. By adopting the attitude of "I can be satisfied without getting what I want," every moment becomes workable and can be met with ease. The practice is to make this simple, repetitive return to relaxation a playful choice, not a burdensome job.

**In essence:** The talk guides the student from a model of **tense, rule-based control** to one of **wise, relaxed allowing**, using the gentle but powerful tool of letting go encapsulated in the phrase: **"It's okay. I don't get what I want, and I can be satisfied with that."**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the dialogue, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by the speakers, primarily by Speaker B (Dhammarato), to illustrate the teachings about meditation, unwholesome thoughts, and relaxation:

### **Metaphors:**

1.  **Drowning:** Speaker A describes feeling like he was going to "drown" in Dukkha (suffering/stress) if he didn't change his approach. Speaker B picks up this metaphor to describe the state of being overwhelmed.
    *   *Example:* "now that you're drowning in Dukkha again, or about to drown..."

2.  **Shooting oneself in the foot:** Speaker A uses this to describe his fear that the "I don't care" / relaxation approach would ultimately be self-sabotaging.
    *   *Example:* "I'm going to basically shoot myself in the foot."

3.  **Ticks on a dog:** This is the central metaphor used by Speaker B to describe persistent unwholesome thoughts.
    *   *Concept:* Unwholesome thoughts are like ticks. You have to patiently pick them off one by one (let them go, drop them). The process seems endless, and as you get better, you find them hiding in new places (subtler thoughts). The key is patient, persistent non-engagement.
    *   *Example:* "...taking ticks off of a dog... the more you look, the more there are... eventually you get them all."

4.  **Balance / The Middle Path:** Referenced by both speakers. The right effort is likened to a balanced, middle-way approach—not too tense, not too lax.
    *   *Example:* "Dan also said that it's kind of like a balance... the right amount of effort." Speaker B confirms: "The Buddha talked about that. It's called the middle path."

5.  **A little dab will do you:** Speaker B uses this phrase (akin to the old Brylcreem slogan) to emphasize being satisfied with a small amount of satisfaction or peace, rather than greedily wanting more.
    *   *Example:* "A little dab will do you. And here you are thinking that one is better than the other..."

6.  **The Car (Analogy of Endless Wanting):** Speaker A references a prior analogy from Speaker B about a man who wants a car, then when he has it still wants it, and when it's gone still wants it. This illustrates the perpetual cycle of craving and dissatisfaction.
    *   *Example:* "It's like that analogy that you told me about yesterday with the car..."

7.  **Being the Director vs. Watching the Show:** Speaker B contrasts the stressful attempt to control experience with the ease of simply observing it.
    *   *Example:* "just watch the show rather than trying to be the director of the show... just enjoy the show."

8.  **The Four Woeful States (Metaphorical Realms):** Speaker B lists these as metaphorical states of mind:
    *   **Hell:** Anger and frustration.
    *   **The Hungry Ghost:** Desperately wanting what you don't have.
    *   **The Dumb Animal:** "Going along to get along," doing what you're told without true satisfaction (like a horse plowing its own pasture).
    *   **The Asura (Titan/Heavenly Warrior):** Dressed for battle but afraid to act—representing fear and inaction.

### **Stories & References:**

1.  **The Buddha and Mara:** Speaker B references the classic story where the Buddha acknowledges distracting thoughts by saying, "I see you, Mara," and then letting them go.
    *   *Example:* "That's exactly the same thing as the Buddha saying, 'aha, I see you, Mara. Oh, never mind.'"

2.  **Dostoevsky's Axe Murderer:** Referenced to illustrate **noisy desperation**—when wanting becomes so intense it must be vocalized or acted upon, leading to woeful states.
    *   *Example:* "that story of Dostoevsky... the axe murderer desperately wanted something... he confessed to the girlfriend because he felt so desperate."

3.  **Henry David Thoreau's "Quiet Desperation":** Used to contrast with "noisy desperation." Our common state of wanting is a quiet background desperation that can become noisy (grasping/clinging).
    *   *Example:* "men live lives of quiet desperation... when does our desperation get noisy?"

4.  **Dan's Teaching Journey:** Speaker B briefly tells a story about "Dan" learning that his job as a drum teacher was not really to teach drums, but to **make friends with his students**. This illustrates a shift in perspective from performing a task to fostering a relationship, applicable to all of life.
    *   *Example:* "he thought that he was teaching drums... his job is to make friends with these young students."

5.  **The Rishi (Aesthetic) and Brian (from *Life of Brian*):** Speaker B references a scene (likely from Monty Python's *Life of Brian*) where a character falls on a silent, meditative ascetic. The point is that the event (the unwholesome thought) happens **to the body/mind**, but "you" (the aware self) can choose your reaction—to be disturbed or to say "never mind."
    *   *Example:* "Remember that story of the life of Brian?... Brian fell on me. How am I going to react to that?... The mind's just there... they come into the mind but not into you."

6.  **IBM and "Who You Know vs. What You Know":** A modern anecdote to debunk the meritocracy myth and emphasize that relationships ("who you know") are ultimately more important than pure performance ("what you know"), mirroring the Dhamma lesson about connection over mere technique.
    *   *Example:* "It's always who you know, not what you know."

### **Core Purpose of These Metaphors and Stories:**
They are used to make abstract Dhamma concepts—like right effort, non-clinging, the nature of thoughts, and the end of suffering—tangible, relatable, and memorable. They help Speaker A (and the listener) shift perspective from **striving and controlling** to **relaxing, observing, and letting go.**
