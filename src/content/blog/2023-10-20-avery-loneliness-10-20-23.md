### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So, Avery, it's really good to see you again, and that you have a question about.

**Speaker B:** Anicca.

**Speaker A:** And so it's actually an interesting topic, and I'll start off with that Long time ago, vegetarianism, because of Hinduism, vegetarianism started to become a thing back in the 1970s. People in Thailand then went to Bhikkhu Buddhadasa to confront him on that, and his answer was, I eat food. That food is food. And that we see that a lot of people get into vegetarianism and vegan foods, and they want justification for themselves being in it and doing it. And so that means that they want other people to do it. Just like in Christianity, the Christians want everybody to follow their rules. This is why abortion has become such an issue, is because so many people, most of the people, don't want to follow the rule. Even Christians don't follow the rule, and even there is no such rule in the Bible. But people like to have rules. And so veganism and vegetarianism now has become a new system of rules. And thou shalt do what I tell you to do, and I tell you to do it because I think it's supposed to be good, but I'm not quite sure. But if I can make everybody do.

**Speaker B:** It— that's basically every diet.

**Speaker A:** And look how many different diets there are on the market. Diets for weight loss, diets for this, that, and the other thing. And that they— a lot of it has to do with not killing. The question is, is not killing What? Because anything that a human would eat, something has to die. Something has to die. That is that kind of, let us say, this planet evolved in that direction, so that little worms are eaten by big worms. That lions will kill the cubs, that there is cannibalism in the natural world. And the whole idea in India, way back when, was, oh, we should not be killing big animals. Now, the Buddha himself was not against the killing of animals. He didn't go around making rules for the society, but rather he ate whatever was available. And that the old tradition is still very quite true in Thailand of when the monks go out of Venerable Bhikkhuni, depends upon what neighborhood they live in. But primarily they get fed what was left over from supper last night. And so whatever the people will give the monks, that's what they got. That in fact, Ajahn Po would take me out and a few others on Vindhabhad, and he intentionally went to the poorer neighborhoods. And that meant that sometimes a half a banana, or a half of a little fish would show up in the bowl, because it was the stuff that was left over from the meals. And that this was actually quite a lesson for me, took me a long time to learn it, because my attitude was, is that, "Hey, I should be supporting these people," rather than them supporting me. But then I began to understand the issues about generosity and gratitude, and instead of having my nose up in the air of, "Oh, I can eat better than this," into the position of that I'm grateful for these people, that even though they don't have much, they're willing to share it. And so this group of people that went to Bhikkhu Buddhadasa about the veganism and vegetarianism, he said to them, "I only eat food," which means that he's not making those kinds of distinctions. And that we, when we choose our diet, we don't make those kinds of distinctions. Now one of the things that I have noticed over my lifetime was that I stopped caring about what I ate. And that actually becomes kind of a humorous issue in the dialogue: "Well, what do you want?" "Well, I don't know, I'm not thinking about food." "What have you got?" And the answer to that is, "We've got all kinds of things, what do you want?" And we are taught in our society from childhood to be choosy about food. That we're choosy naturally, in the sense of that we want to eat what we know, rather than trying something new. And also there's issues about some things taste differently, and we're not used to them. There's a term for that called an acquired taste. And another thing that happens with children, is the parents won't let the children eat what they want to eat. Instead, they'll tell the child, "Oh, you've got to eat your broccoli, and then you can have dessert." And so we get all of these rules involved with what we are supposed to eat, and when the rules go really badly, people wind up being vegan or having a particular kind of diet. And then they look down on other people for not following that diet, in the sense of killing. Except that people who are on these vegan diets will often eat nuts, and that the production of these nuts, almonds, avocados, those kinds of things, require an awful lot of work, an awful lot of water, an awful lot of resources, that the vegans are insisting that they have a particular diet, and that they're actually causing more harm in the environment by being picky, and that it would be better if they would just kind of eat naturally and anything will do. That this is the way that it's best understood, is that we cause trouble by trying to figure out what's the best thing that I'm supposed to eat. And there's an awful lot of different diets, and there's an awful lot of research, and saying, oh, this food is bad, There will be articles about the 10 things that cause liver cancer, or kidney problems are caused by a particular food, or whatever like that. Or you should be getting vitamin D, you got to take vitamin supplements because your diet is not good enough. Right? So, there's a lot of worry that we don't need to go into, that in fact, a much better thing to do would be have the right attitude. And the right attitude is, I'm healthy regardless of what I eat. And I can be mindful and watch what I'm eating, and see what effects it has. One of the things, in fact, about medications and supplements and the pure form of medications is people will take it because they're told to. They take it because they saw an ad, they take it because the doctor gave them a prescription, and then they're not paying attention to what value that medicine has. And so if you are taking medicine, the right thing to do with it is to check things out. What's the effect of that medicine? Does it actually work? And the same thing is true about the food that we eat. Some foods have an effect And it's good to have the information about the foods, but don't make the information about foods into a rule of, "Oh, you should only eat this particular kind of food," but rather having a wide variety. So a wide variety of foods is probably the best healthy, but don't make that into a rule that you have to have a wide variety. That sometimes variety is limited for a particular period of time. But the point is, is that how do we feel?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the whole— the actual reason I brought this up is because I started experimenting with it a lot, and I found that something that kind of helps me focus and stay calm is usually just a salad with maybe some chickpeas or like something like that. And I thought that that was kind of interesting.

**Speaker A:** Paying attention to what we eat and the effects that it has on us is the better way to go, which, by the way, is part of the Eightfold Noble Path, is to remember to look at what value a particular food or a particular medication will have, what's the thing that's going on with it, and because then we have better choices. An example of that was that my mother heard many, many years ago, long before it became common knowledge, that aspirin was good. And so she started taking aspirin every day. She wound up taking 4 of the big tablets, the 300mg tablets, not the 80mg, baby aspirin, and that caused acid. And so she was constantly spitting up, but she kept taking the aspirin because she had gotten into the habit of it, thinking that it was the right thing to do. Well, that in fact, the— I remember the original research was, is that it was about heart conditions. And that they did a vast experiment, a vast double-blind control, and that the people who were in the control were ones that had particular trouble with particular diseases of the heart and cardiovascular, and that the aspirin is a little bit of a blood thinner. Not real heavy-duty blood thinner, but it does have the quality of thinning the blood. And because of that, they stopped the experiment and put everybody that was in the control group on aspirin. And this got to be great big news. But years later, they revised that and decided that taking aspirin is not such a big deal, so you don't hear about it. Nearly the way that it was happening in the 1960s and '70s, that research is often done in a fad, that we get this kind of information and we say, "Oh, because of this information, this thing is really good, therefore everybody should be taking this." And then later they find out, "Well, wait a minute." We were wrong about that, and so we stopped pushing, say, aspirin, or we stopped pushing certain drugs. Another example was multivitamins. Multivitamins were a huge deal back in the '70s, but now I think partly because of advertising, it was a new product on the market and everybody is supposed to have multivitamins. But now there's not much to it. Some people take multivitamins, most people don't. Those who do, it's not a regular thing. But at one time, that was a rule that in fact even schools would force the parents to put the kids on multivitamins. Right, so the problem with food is our ideas about looking for the best thing and trying to make everybody do what we're doing. That even happens, by the way, with alcohol, that people who drink want everybody to drink. And so they get into cliques, so that if you're drinking alcohol and drinking a lot, you will wind up associating with people who drink a lot. This is one of the points about coming out of drinking alcohol, and it's especially true with the AA, the Alcoholics Anonymous, is to teach people to stay away from your old friends. Go make some new friends. Who don't drink. If you drink and want to quit, then stop associating with all of your old friends who drink and want you to drink too.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** And so this— I've been thinking, like.

**Speaker B:** That reminds me of, uh, how you talk about having noble friends. And at first I thought it was kind of silly, but the more time goes on, the more I realize, well, a lot of my friends don't really have any interest in this kind of stuff. Like, a lot of the people I see at my school roommates, etc. So I've kind of been trying to get in touch with more people who are from the Sangha, and I've had some good conversations with them too. So that's good.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, I highly recommend being around other noble people, people who are nobly minded, those who are interested in stopping all of their problems. And yet here we are talking about food, and so many people wind up making food a problem, like the vegetarians. And in fact, the story that I heard about it was that it was a whole busload of people who came from Bangkok all the way down to Suwanmokk to confront Bhikkhu Buddhadasa because he was not a vegetarian. I think in fact that that happened because it was during those years in the 1970s where vegetarianism became a fad. And the fad was that everybody should be a vegetarian, not recognizing that a wide variety of food is a whole lot easier. And if you are limited in the kind of food that you have available, then why make rules about, "Oh, this food that is available is not good enough." Let's go ahead and have fun and eat what is available. And so let's not make trouble, let's not make any problems about food, but rather let's be mindful of what the food does for each individual person. And make it easy. That's the way to look, is that let's make food not an issue, not a problem.

**Speaker B:** Makes sense. Yeah. One other thing, this is off topic, so if I'm stealing your thunder, let me know. You okay with such topics?

**Speaker A:** Go ahead. Yes, go ahead and ask the question.

**Speaker B:** All right. It's sort of like, it's kind of hard for me to stay in the right mindset in the environment that I live in right now, and I can't really change it. But I don't know, I find myself wanting more and more often to just kind of live somewhere that's a lot quieter. And then, hmm, sorry, overthinking it. But yeah, there's like some things that I can control about my environment. Like if I wanted to, I could clean up my room or maybe turn off the light, whatever. But then there's a lot of things I can't control about where I live, which Over— I think if I could choose everything, I would kind of just prefer to live in a place that's, uh, I guess tropical and usually sunny and, uh, close to like a forest or lake or something like that. But I'm trying to practice wherever I go.

**Speaker A:** Yes, well, there's two issues about it, and the two issues are inside and outside. That when you are in a particular physical environment on the outside, the environment that you're in does affect the mind, but you have control over your mind so that those things don't affect you much. For instance, if the neighbors are really noisy right now We can take a walk. We don't have to go to confront them and try to fix them so that you're happy. Rather, we can leave. That— there's an old phrase that I picked up many, many years ago. It is based upon the phrase, when the going gets tough, The tough get going. Have you ever heard of that? All right, pardon?

**Speaker B:** It kind of makes sense. What does it mean exactly?

**Speaker A:** Well, uh, let's get into that after I finish it. Okay, sorry, a thing. And that is, when the going gets tough, the tough get going. But then there's the other one: when the going gets tough, The Bard go drinking. And then the third one is, when the going gets tough, the Buddha takes a hike. All right, so the going gets tough, the tough get going means that when things are difficult, we're supposed to fight it. We're supposed to get get tough, because we don't like things. And that would be the fight. And then the flight would be, when the going gets tough, the bard goes drinking. But that's not a healthy way of taking flight. That a better way is, when the going gets tough, the Buddha takes a hike. Now, we can take that hike in the physical environment when the neighbors are noisy, you can open the door and go out on the street or go for a walk or whatever. But there's also the possibility of taking the hike without leaving the room. And that is that we can become distracted We can listen to something else. We can actually look inside and say, "The room, the house is noisy, the neighbors are noisy, but I'm okay. I can handle that. I'm strong enough to let them be noisy and I'm still happy." So we can divert our thought patterns from 'I don't like their noise' into 'It don't bother me, I'm okay, I'm all right with that, everything is okay, everything is fine.' And in that regard, every time and every moment is an opportunity to practice the Dharma. There's a moment for everything. And so anytime that we get into a state of not liking because of something in our environment, We have the choice of either leaving it physically or leaving it mentally. But grumbling around because the neighbors are noisy is not recommended. Better to stop being so tough about the noise that we don't like. You know that it's very common in America now that there is a certain kind of belligerence that's grown up. In our environment now, so that the cops kill more people, that the— there's even a word for it, a Karen, you know, the people who see you do something and then they don't like it and they come in and confront you. Don't park your car in front of my house. That kind of thing that is happening, and it happens frequently. That means then that the people create a tough situation in their mind: "I don't like that guy parking in front of my house, and now I'm going to go be tough and take my baseball bat out and break his windows." And I think that that's in fact been there to a lesser degree. All along, for centuries even. But now that we have cell phones and record things and it winds up on the internet, we can see just how violent humanity is, and it's becoming even more so. Violence in the politics, violence in the road rage, all that kind of— when the tough gets going, the or when they bend the tough people get tough, they get strong, they get angry. And if you have those kind of feelings like, I want to put a stop to what those people are doing, we can say, aha, I see that. I see that I'm getting a tough attitude. And the easy way out is just ignore them. Or to take a hike where you don't have to deal with it. Now the Buddha recommends both of those things, and the way that I would say it is that if you can't handle it yourself inside your own mind, then do something about it. And the Buddha gave 4 examples. One was, is if there is an area that is having a famine, there's no food, a drought or whatever like that, then it's best for the monks to leave that area. If there is a war going on, if there are people being yelling and violent with each other, don't try to intervene with it. Take a hike instead. Go away. If there is pestilence, if people are sick and there's a plague going on, the best thing to do is to get away from that, to go someplace else. Like for instance, Nostradamus, very famous, during the plague, he would stay in a tower. I've heard the same thing about Isaac Newton, that there was a plague going on when he was alive, and so he stayed kind of locked up in cloistered, he would stay away from it. So the same thing is true about alcohol. Stay away from people who are drinking. Stay away from them. And so let's see, I've covered— and the last one would be a flood. That if there is a flood, that's a good reason for people to leave that area. And so the Buddha recommends that. Now, How we can handle that in the situation of, let us say, arguing with the wife or arguing with a friend is that when you recognize that an argument is going on, we can either leave the argument.

**Speaker B:** That's a Bhikkhuni, actually. I don't engage in arguments much anymore because I kind of see how pointless most of them are.

**Speaker A:** Oh yes, nobody wins an argument. Everybody leaves an argument feeling bad. Nobody gets any benefit. But in fact, there was back in the, let us say about 15 years ago, there was a lot of arguments going on between Christianity and the atheist, and the major argument was, does God exist? And the point was, is that nobody got around to actually do pining what the word God meant. So in some cases, the word God is used and there's no such thing as that. But you can also use the word God in a different context, and of course it exists, that in fact the environment you live in, the air you breathe, the ground that you walk on, is your God. Because you can't do a whole lot about it. That we live in the environment— that this is, in Buddhism, is what we call the Dhammakaya, the whole body of the Dharma.

**Speaker B:** Is that like going with the flow then?

**Speaker A:** Like, yes, uh-huh, that the flow is— in fact, that's a good definition of God. What's the flow? Like, for instance, there's a flood If you're in the flood, you don't have much choice about which direction that you're going. I remember when I was a kid, by the way, I was at the river and this guy wanted to swim to the other side, and he did, except that he wound up not going straight across the river to get from here to there where he wanted. He wound up getting on the other side about a mile down. He disappeared while he was still swimming. The current— he couldn't, he couldn't buck the current. He was swimming, yes, and he'd made it across the river, but he got a whole lot further down the river by the river rather than getting across the river by his own efforts. And so this is an understanding of that, yes, there are things that are well beyond our control.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** And that, uh, that's in a kind of a really big way. And so you can define God as that, but putting a personality, a name, dressing it up, putting a beard on it, that is not a really good idea. That Jesus would say that, uh, that the, uh, the kingdom of God, or the— actually, in the Greek, it's, uh Basilica, Theos. And the Basilica, you've heard the word Basilica, that's like a great big cathedral. So it's a vast place, it's a palace, or a garden, or a paradise. And this Basilica Theos, this Kingdom of God, actually is within us, is part of our attitude. Is part of being alive, that when you breathe in, you're breathing in God, and when you breathe out, you're breathing out God. Everything around us is God if we define it that way. And so when people would say, I have a personal relationship with God, there's two possibilities. One is that they've got complicated thoughts about it, are number 2, they're living well in their environment, living in our senses, being in the present moment. Because when we're in the present moment, we actually are in the presence of God. But there's no use to putting a personality on it, thinking that God takes care of me Well, the environment that you're in does support you. Without the gravity, you'd fly up into the air, you'd go into outer space. Without the air to breathe, we would die. And so God does support us. But praying to God saying, "Oh, I wish you would fix my Granny who's in the hospital," that's but it's wishful thinking, and it's oftentimes ritualized, so that people do a prayer. In my family, it was always at the mealtime: "God is great, God is good, and we thank him for our food." But modern kids now will say, "McDonald's is great, McDonald's is good, and we thank McDonald's for our food. But McDonald's is part of God too. Or Safeway is great, Safeway is good, and we thank Safeway for our food.

**Speaker B:** You mean Subway?

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** I think you mean Subway, like the subs, the sandwich shop.

**Speaker A:** Oh, we don't know. Safeway was a famous grocery store.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I don't know. I've been to Pickle Wiggly, I've been to Walgreens, I've been to Jewel-Osco, but I haven't been to Safeway.

**Speaker A:** Well, then you don't have to thank Safeway for your food. But the point of that little rhyme would be to feel gratitude that we're alive, that we do have food to eat, that we do have nourishment.

**Speaker B:** Gratitude and being in the present moment are like two things that I think are really, really good for kind of relaxing and get into a good mood. But when I sit down to meditate, I try more and more to just stay in the breath and not really let any of the thoughts come up because we don't even control, like we don't have full control over what we think about, which is— it really hit me when I was meditating earlier that like I was relaxing and kind of breathing, and then this one memory that I really didn't like came up, and I was like, but I didn't choose for that to happen. I didn't choose that at all, you know.

**Speaker A:** It just came up, kind of like it's wild. Yeah, because we don't have any control over it. But one of the qualities that we have in our civilization is that we expect our children to have some training. Unfortunately, we don't do a very good job of training our children, and so when you were a child, you really didn't get any good mental training. The example of that would be a laptop with, say, Windows. Or Unix. If you want to use the computer, you have to learn about Windows, and it takes some training. And the more training you have, the easier the PC is to use. Okay, well, the mind is exactly that way too, except the mind is far more sophisticated than Windows. But it still needs to be examined, learned, and trained. And so yes, those thoughts do come up. Basically, they come up out of our past. One way of looking about it, of thinking about it, is that very few people actually have original thoughts. Everybody has a few, and that inventors would have quite a lot of original thoughts, but it would still be less than 5 or 10%. That even for thinkers who dream up stuff, inventors will do that invention based upon the products that they already know about, things that they have learned. And so these random thoughts that we have are actually just in the storage bin, and we pull that thought out and we pull this thought out, and people think that these thoughts are brand new, that nobody's ever had that thought before, to where in fact, oh yes, they have. That this is probably an old thought, I've just forgotten where I'd gotten it from. And so now we can recognize that we have some control over which thoughts we're going to have. This is the training for Anapanasati. This is the training of the mind, is that we have choices. And we have a choice about what we're going to think every moment, if we can remember that we have choices. That we can choose what we're going to do. We can choose what we're going to think.

**Speaker B:** It's weird though, because when I— sometimes I think I might just not want to think at all. I might just want to say I'm tired of thinking. I just want to lie here and relax, you know, not do anything.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, you can do that by kind of shutting a mental door. An example would be, when you're home alone, "I'm not going to think about school." Another one would be for a traveler, let's say someone travels from England to Thailand, because in fact this has happened, and I would recommend to that student, "When you're in Thailand, don't think about England." Think about Thailand. If you're going to have thoughts, remember to not think about England. Okay, so if you're home alone, don't think about school, or for some people, don't think about the computer, anything that has to do with computer. No, I'm not going to think about that. And so we remember to, and then what, a minute later we're thinking about the computer again. But if we can remember, "Oh, I'm not going to think about that computer, I'm really glad that I caught it," and then we can be happy again. And then, thoughts about the computer will come back again. Well, that's all right. But if we then start shutting a lot of the doors, we can say, "Okay, I'm not going to think about school, and I'm not going to think about the computer, and I'm not going to think about another place." or another time. I'm going to stay here and be in the senses. So let us say you're laying in bed, getting ready to go to sleep. Stay in the present moment. Feel the pillow, feel the covers, feel the body. Do some breathing. Think about what's happening right now with the idea of, wow, this is nice. I don't have to think about the computer, I don't have to think about school, I don't have to think about that argument that I had with Aunt Susie, I can just lay here and pay attention to how nice it is. That's the way then of just having, that's all I'm going to think about is my breathing and my sensory input and how nice it is.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Dammarato] I might do that really soon, I'm getting tired actually.

**Speaker A:** And that will be in the direction then of not having any thoughts at all, because look how many doors you have closed. Pretty soon there's not much to think about anymore, and everything is okay, and everything is happy, and there's no dangers, there's no worries. And so we stop thinking. We put some gaps in those thoughts. And the way to do that is to have a wholesome thought about what's happening right now, and then have another wholesome thought and another one. And pretty soon we can put some gaps in those wholesome thoughts. But if we're not being mindful, we'll get wrapped up into a particular topic about the computer. Oh, I got to do this, and I got to do that, and I got to do this other thing, and how am I going to get that thing done, and all of this kind of stuff. And now we're caught in a great big cycle of fury of thoughts. But if you can remember, oh, I'm not going to think about the computer right now, not going to think about it, not going to think about school. So we can put some limits in there.

**Speaker B:** I like this idea.

**Speaker A:** That in fact I'm not going to think about food. If I'm not eating, why should I think about food? Let's think about food when we're actually eating. And when we are eating, let's think about food and not think about the computer. Put the cell phone down while we're eating.

**Speaker B:** That's how you live in the moment.

**Speaker A:** And live in the present moment. Enjoy your food. Taste it. Mull it over in the mouth, see yourself extracting the fluids and swallowing them, and then continuing to chew the various pieces. And so being in the present moment is actually quite limiting to the number of thoughts that we have. But look what we could do, look how many thoughts that we could have about school. Look how many thoughts we could have about YouTube, watching YouTube, playing with the computer, etc., like that. And that keeps the mind kind of busy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Well, thank you for just talking with me. I think we talked about like 3 different things. Well, a lot of different things.

**Speaker A:** Enjoy. Remember that you're in the present moment, to be happy and enjoy the present moment.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. That's very— thank you.

**Speaker A:** I would also recommend that you spend more time with nobles, like on Skype, on our groups, or on, um, if you're going to websites, visit Watson Temples on the website.

**Speaker B:** The Open Sangha Foundation.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that would be one. Yeah, come enjoy. Have you actually looked around? I know that you've poked around a little bit. Do some posting, give some messages, upload a file or two. We've got all of those features in there. A lot of stuff to read, all of it mostly wholesome.

**Speaker B:** Thanks, I'll check it out.

**Speaker A:** All right, Avery, really, really glad to see you again. I hope to see you often.

**Speaker B:** Have a great night, or I guess it'd be morning. Goodbye.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key themes and advice shared by Dhammarato (Speaker A) in conversation with Avery (Speaker B):

### **Core Themes:**

1.  **Non-Dogmatism in Diet & Lifestyle:** The talk begins by critiquing rigid dietary rules (like vegetarianism/veganism) and comparing them to other dogmatic systems. The emphasis is on not creating problems or judgment around food. The ideal is to eat what is available with gratitude, observing the effects of food on your body and mind without turning personal preferences into universal rules.

2.  **The Importance of Attitude Over Rules:** Repeatedly, the speaker advises cultivating the right internal attitude rather than following external rules. This applies to food, medicine, and life situations. The "right attitude" is one of mindfulness, gratitude, and contentment, being "healthy regardless of what I eat."

3.  **Choosing Your Environment & Noble Friends:** A significant portion discusses how to deal with an unpleasant or distracting environment (like noisy neighbors). The advice is twofold:
    *   **Externally:** If possible, "take a hike"—literally remove yourself from toxic situations (conflict, plague, bad influences) as the Buddha advised.
    *   **Internally:** Cultivate mental strength to not be bothered by external conditions. This is linked to the importance of associating with "noble friends"—people interested in Dhamma and reducing suffering—and distancing from those who pull you into unwholesome habits.

4.  **Mind Training & Thought Management:** The conversation shifts to meditation and the nature of thoughts. Key points include:
    *   We don't have full control over what thoughts arise, as they often come from past conditioning.
    *   However, we *do* have a choice in whether to engage with them. Training the mind involves consciously "closing doors" on unwanted thought streams (about work, past arguments, etc.).
    *   The method is to gently redirect attention to the present moment—the breath, bodily sensations, gratitude—thereby creating gaps between thoughts and moving towards peace.

5.  **Living in the Present Moment:** This is presented as the practical solution to many issues. Being fully present while eating, walking, or resting limits proliferative thinking and connects one to a sense of okay-ness. The speaker even reframes the concept of "God" as the supportive, uncontrollable flow of the present-moment environment.

### **Practical Advice Given:**

*   **On Food:** Pay attention to how food makes you feel, but don't be picky or make it an identity. Appreciate what is given.
*   **On Environment:** If you can't change a difficult external situation, change your internal response to it. If that fails, physically remove yourself.
*   **On Thoughts:** When uninvited thoughts arise, note them and deliberately redirect your attention to a wholesome anchor in the present (e.g., "I'm not going to think about that now; I'm going to feel the pillow and my breath").
*   **On Practice:** Seek out and spend time with a noble-minded Sangha for support and encouragement.

### **Overall Message:**
The talk encourages a flexible, mindful, and non-dogmatic approach to practice. The path is about reducing mental suffering by letting go of rigid rules, cultivating gratitude and a good internal attitude, wisely choosing one's influences, and diligently training the mind to dwell in the peace of the present moment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by Speaker A (the teacher) to illustrate their points:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **"When the going gets tough..." Metaphors:** A series of contrasting metaphors to illustrate different responses to difficulty:
    *   **"The tough get going"**: Metaphor for a confrontational, aggressive response (fight).
    *   **"The bard goes drinking"**: Metaphor for an escapist, unhealthy response (flight through intoxication).
    *   **"The Buddha takes a hike"**: Metaphor for the recommended response—wisely and mindfully removing oneself from a troubling situation, either physically or mentally.

2.  **The Mind as a Computer/Operating System:** The mind is compared to a laptop running Windows or Unix. It's sophisticated but requires training and examination to use it well, just as one must learn an operating system.

3.  **"Shutting Mental Doors":** A metaphor for consciously choosing not to engage with certain streams of thought (e.g., about school, work, or the past), thereby limiting mental chatter and creating gaps between thoughts.

4.  **God as the Environment/Flow:** God is metaphorically defined as the uncontrollable, supportive flow of reality—the environment, gravity, air, and the present moment. This contrasts with a personalized, bearded deity. The **river current** story (below) serves as a concrete example of this metaphor.

5.  **Food as "Just Food":** A recurring metaphor that food should not be overly categorized or moralized ("vegetarian," "vegan," "good," "bad") but seen simply as nourishment. This is presented as a way to avoid creating rules and problems.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and the Vegetarians:** The story of a busload of people from Bangkok confronting the Thai monk Buddhadasa in the 1970s about not being vegetarian. His reported response, **"I only eat food,"** is a central story illustrating the principle of non-discrimination and avoiding dogmatic rules about diet.

2.  **Alms Round with Ajahn Po:** A personal story about going on alms round (Vindhabhad) in poor neighborhoods in Thailand. Receiving only half a banana or a small fish taught the lesson of **generosity and gratitude** over preference or judgment about the quality of food.

3.  **The Aspirin Fad Story:** The story of the speaker's mother taking high-dose aspirin daily because early research touted its benefits, leading to acid reflux. This illustrates how health information can become a rigid, unexamined "rule" that causes harm, and how scientific recommendations change over time.

4.  **The Man Swimming Across the River:** A story from the speaker's childhood about a man trying to swim directly across a river but being carried far downstream by the current. This is an **allegory for "going with the flow"** and recognizing forces (metaphorically called "God" or "Dhammakaya") larger than individual control.

5.  **The Mealtime Prayer Adaptation:** A brief, modernized version of the classic grace ("God is great, God is good...") replaced with "McDonald's is great..." or "Safeway is great...". This story humorously reinforces the point that gratitude for nourishment can be directed toward the immediate, tangible sources in our environment, aligning with the broader metaphor of God as the supportive system of life.

6.  **The Buddha's Advice for Monks to Leave:** Reference to the Buddha's practical advice for monks to leave an area in cases of **famine, war, pestilence, or flood**. This story provides scriptural backing for the "take a hike" principle when a situation is unworkable or dangerous.

These metaphors and stories work together to frame the talk's core themes: avoiding dogmatic rules (especially around food), practicing mindful choice and gratitude, wisely dealing with difficult environments, and training the mind to dwell peacefully in the present moment.
