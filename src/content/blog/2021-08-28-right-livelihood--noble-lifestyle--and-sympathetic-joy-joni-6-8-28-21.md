### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Well, Johnny, it's good to see you again. It's been a while. Let's start with the question that you were asking about Right Livelihood. And you said something very interesting. You said that people don't talk about it very much. That's kind of funny. Funny because I remember it being talked about a lot.

**Speaker B:** Hmm.

**Speaker A:** And maybe we could go so far as to say that, uh, they talked about it a lot, but they don't talk about it much anymore. Maybe that was it, because the times that I remember when there was a lot talking about was way back when, the 1970s, the 1980s, and that kind of stuff. And it may have been talked up partly because it was kind of one of the new kids on the scene. And so now it's kind of like a forgotten child. The first thing that we can say about the Right Livelihood is that yes, it is one of the Noble Path factors. It is part of the method for freedom. And so if you have a job, that the job itself, in order to make the job successful and productive, means that everybody, not just you, but everyone who has that profession or that kind of occupation lies to people in order to be successful in the business. That's either the manufacturer himself that is over-promoting his own merchandise that he's manufactured, or it's a salesman who didn't make it and is still talking it up to the person who's wanting to buy it. In that regard, we have actually just nailed one of the professions that the Buddha has on his list, is buying and selling. Now, a lot of Westerners, when they see that, they separate it out like it was three words: buying and selling. And so they look at the buying and that's bad, and we look at the selling, that's bad. But in fact, in the Pali, the word buying and selling is just one word. And that it has— in fact, that would be the word that they would have for business. So if you were in business, you probably got wrong livelihood. Sorry about that. Let's go look why.

**Speaker B:** Yes, let's go.

**Speaker A:** All right, but, but first let's understand that there's, um, ordinary ways of looking at it and noble ways of looking at it. And in the ordinary way of looking at it, it's kind of like a rule or a law or a gotcha, or a finger-pointing device, na-na-na-na-na. That's the ordinary way of looking at it, and that's the way in fact that morality is taught to children. And that in fact the precepts themselves don't even have right livelihood as one of the items on the list. In the precepts, the right livelihood was not mentioned. That right action is broken down into several groups, leaving right speech as an item, and then they left off the item of right livelihood. And I think part of the reason for that is because those precepts are designed to teach kids who already have right livelihood. Being a mooch on Mommy and Daddy is right livelihood, so long as Mommy and Daddy are agreeing to it. Yes, that in fact, that's what mother's milk actually is, is right livelihood for the baby. He gives the nourishment he does, he needs, and all he does is suck. Yes, play on words there, by the way.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** And so there is an ordinary right view that's taught from time to time, but since it's not really in the precepts, It's not really hammered home in many ways, and that leaves people with vast imaginations to imagine all kinds of things that would be considered right livelihood that is not right livelihood, as well as considering a whole lot of stuff that wouldn't be right livelihood, and they think that it's right livelihood. Basically, what we can use as the guide for all of this stuff is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. The livelihood that we have that brings Dukkha to ourselves or to other people is not right livelihood, not noble right livelihood. And sometimes our livelihood is downright wrong because the things that we're doing in our wrong livelihood actually harms folks. Harms people. And so some of the examples of that kind of stuff would be being in the business of weapons, weapons dealing, weapons manufacture. Uh, in those days it was swords, nowadays it's AK-47s. But whatever we're doing, it's, uh, if the design for this item is to harm, to blow holes in things, skin and otherwise, then We're actually now intending to profit or take advantage off of someone else's or something else's demise or destruction. And so that reason, weaponry and poisons. Now the question would be, well, what poisons would go on there? For instance, would DDT go on that list? Well, the FDA would say yes.

**Speaker B:** I see.

**Speaker A:** Yes, but some of your farmers would not because they see the advantage in killing all of those bugs, not recognizing that they also kill things in the water, and the water gets in the river, and they kill things in the river, and so on. And so basically what we're going for with the understanding of right livelihood then is not causing harm, not doing damage either to other people or to ourselves. That in fact, that's what the whole teaching of the Buddha is, and that as we learn to not create and cause Dukkha for ourselves, we get very, very sophisticated at understanding what is Dukkha so that we can avoid it. And then we avoid shoveling it on other people because we recognize this law of karma that's in there, that if you give people a bunch of crap, they're going to give you some of theirs back. That's just how things are.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so, um, an example of that is, uh, the gun manufacturers are now being sued in the United States by guess whom? The Mexican government is suing gun manufacturers in the United States in federal court. Why? Because they're dumping weapons into Mexico, causing all kinds of trouble down there. Actually, they're going so far as to making weapons special order from the cartels. That's got certain features, and they manufacture them and then smuggle them right into Mexico. And the Mexican government, the Mexican people have had enough of that. So that's an example right there of wrong livelihood. But we could have said, well, wait a minute, they're making weapons anyway, and that's on the Buddha's list. That should be enough for me. No, it's actually a good idea to recognize why. Okay. That in fact, what I'm really talking about now is that I've made a shift from the Eightfold Noble Path into talking about the teachings to the Kalama people, where the Buddha says, do not take a teaching based upon tradition or based upon your teacher's knowledge or based upon the fact that it was written in a book or it's hearsay. Common knowledge, or you heard it on the street corner, or my best Buddha buddy told me this, or any of that kind of stuff. But rather— and not only that, but we can't just automatically accept it because it feels good, because there is certain things like confirmation bias. They've even got a label for it now, and boy, is that pernicious in the sense that the people will take things as true because they already thought that they were true, and so therefore when it presents itself in a new way, they just automatically take it because it already agrees with what they have, rather than making yet a new investigation. So this is the way that each one of us has to do, and mostly there is an underlying question that people who would watch this video would ask to themselves, and you probably ask yourself that too. You're not actually asking me to, oh, tell all about the Buddha's Eightfold Noble Path, including right noble occupation. But what you're saying is, is the question of, in what I'm doing now, does that fit?

**Speaker B:** Yes, that's— yeah, of course, that's the main thing.

**Speaker A:** What I'm doing now, is that right livelihood or is that wrong livelihood? And the answer is, is that it depends upon the way you look at it and the way you feel about it. And it doesn't have much to do with what someone like myself tells you. What I can do is guide you into looking for yourself how the occupation that you have causes you misery. And suffering.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** And when you recognize that it is in fact causing you misery and suffering, you have some choices now to make that you didn't know that you had before. New choices. One of them is to change your attitude, which is the one that I highly recommend, because that's actually the easier thing to do, is to change your attitude about your job so that you act in that job more nobly, rather than expecting the nobility to come out of the job itself.

**Speaker B:** Yes, of course.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, any job that's going to be noble has to have some nobility put into the job, because other than that, the job itself is empty. It's Sunyata, doesn't mean a thing.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Yeah, I mean, it has become quite apparent, I would say, that like It's all about me, not necessarily the activity itself, in the sense of like— because like sometimes I've had very pleasant states at work and I've had very unpleasant states at work. So it seems quite obvious that like

**Speaker A:** in that case it couldn't possibly be the work itself, no, could it?

**Speaker B:** Exactly, exactly. It's not the job itself, it's me and the way that I approach it, the way that I feel about in that particular moment and that sort of thing. Yes, yeah, yes, of course, that all makes quite a lot of sense, and it's quite easy to discern that that is indeed the case. Not about like some factual, some like written thing like you do this, you don't do that. It's about how you feel and how you engage with that activity. And how— what that activity kind of helps you cultivate, if it helps you cultivate suffering or cultivate more peace and that sort of thing. Yes. Okay, so of course it all comes from me, right? But being in a certain place or doing a certain kind of activity in general has a kind of, um, a kind of flavor to it. It can be like a flavor that's kind of like slightly shifts towards positivity or slightly shifts towards negativity, um, almost like a certain vibe that it's there that like once you enter your workplace there's a almost like a shift that you can feel it almost in the body and in the mind as well, like a an environmental shift of like, it kind of pulls you towards a certain direction. But of course, that all just seems like a bunch of like construction constructs of the mind that I'm making. And I don't know if I make any sense.

**Speaker A:** Actually, what you're touching on here is, let us put it in quotations in the beginning, and then we'll take quotations out when we see that they're really not necessary. Okay, so in quotations we can say, now that I'm having trouble putting it into words now that I want to put it in quotations.

**Speaker B:** Well, if it helps remove the quotations, maybe we can start with that as well.

**Speaker A:** Right, okay. Well, let's go in this direction then. It is what you make of it, and when you make it, then we become attached to it as in the sense that it's mine, and in fact we think of it as my job, rather than thinking of it in the sense of, well, this is what we're doing right now. Yes, that we get long time frames and long references, that we can't just be who we are right now because we've got to carry, let us say, not just the baggage, but maybe even the dressings of the clothing of what we were before. Okay, that would be especially true For people who have changed jobs, now that they are going in their first day, week or so of the new job, they feel frightened and afraid because they somehow think or realize that the clothing, the mental clothing that they were wearing in the old job doesn't fit into the new job. Okay, so back to the point about The— it has to do then with environment, that you've heard things like you are what you eat.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Well, there's another one that's actually quite important, but they don't say it like this because nobody can make any money off of this. And that is that you are where you are.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Where you are, that determines who you are. Now let's give some examples of that. One of them would be the example of the barfly versus, let us say, versus a delivery boy who delivers pizza, but he's very young and he's never been in a bar before, and he walks into the bar and it's got a certain flavor or smell and he's got disagreeable— to where the barfly, this is familiar. Okay, now in that environment of those two, which one is most likely to become an alcoholic? Or the kid just wandered in there because he's delivering pizza.

**Speaker B:** I think the barfly, because he's been there cultivating that habit for a long time.

**Speaker A:** Especially since I— when I announced this as guilt by association. Hmm. All right, or you are where you are. This happens in all kinds of things. Frozen. Are you still there?

**Speaker B:** Oh, sorry, you're cutting off a bit. Can you hear me?

**Speaker A:** Yes, now I can hear you. Started to move again. Okay, sorry. Okay, this thing that I started to put into quotations was the phrase guilt by association. That we are guilty of doing the things that the people that we hang around with are doing. Actually, it's written right into the law in the sense of accomplice to a crime. You don't have to be involved with it. All you have to do is just sort of be at the wrong place at the wrong time and know you are.

**Speaker B:** I see. Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So the same thing happens with many other things. For instance, when a young man gets married, he stops hanging out with his old buddies and starts hanging out with people that his wife wants him to hang out with, which winds up being newly married people.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Another example of that is that when a young man joins the army, Does he get to stay at home and only go to the army post like a regular job, 9 to 5? No, no, they want him. They want— they want him, right? He's going to be completely submerged into the culture of boot camp. Another example of that, that is language immersion. If you really want to learn a foreign language, you don't stay in a culture where they don't speak that language, trying to learn it out of a book or online or something like that. No, if you want to learn Thai, you come to Thailand.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Right. Immersed into the culture. So jobs are like that too. There can be two identical corporations, both of them producing the same thing. In fact, they may in fact be set up to where they might be in competition with each other, but they all buy their raw goods from the same people, and then they all sell their finished product to the same people. And yet one of those places would be a wholesome place to work, an environment that is conducive, and the other one is completely unwholesome. And that may be a mixed bag in the sense that one, let us say, Place A, may be wholesome for some people and not wholesome for others, and then Place B would be opposite of that, and the people who would have a wholesome environment there will find it unwholesome, and the people who would have an unwholesome life in A will find it wholesome in B. It's like I said, a mixed bag. Why? Because it depends upon the results of the mind.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And that often the guy who runs the show is the one who determines whether this organization is going to be a wholesome organization or is going to be an unwholesome organization.

**Speaker B:** Hmm.

**Speaker A:** Clear example of that in politics would be the politician who is selfish and wants it only for his party versus the other one who is looking out for the greater common good.

**Speaker B:** Hmm. Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so that can be seen in corporations too, that some corporations are only interested in their own bottom line and other corporations are interested in the greater good. Even though their ideas of greater good may be mismanaged or off-kilter or even on Mars, still Elon Musk has a more noble way of looking at the world. Rather than other automobile manufacturers who were merely in it for the cash.

**Speaker B:** The intention is there, right?

**Speaker A:** So some— and the intention counts. Even though the highway to hell is paved with good intention, the other side of hell is heaven. And if you keep with your good intentions, you'll pass through hell right into where you're going anyway. All you have to do is pick up some skills along the way of getting out of hell.

**Speaker B:** Right. So when we— let's say, so I like to like approach stuff as if like everything is a practice, and being whatever place we are in is a chance to practice something, and we can cultivate good stuff, wholesome stuff, or we can cultivate unwholesome stuff at any place, at any time. And so would it be— so like right now, like, the relationship that I have with my job is that it's like, it's a big annoyance, it's a big place where I find myself naturally cultivating Anapanasati.

**Speaker A:** Let me ask you this question. Is the company, is the job annoying you, or are you annoying the job?

**Speaker B:** Good question. Yeah, it's certainly me. It's certainly not the job. It's now— and all this always everything always comes from the way that I'm feeling and how my thoughts are and how my mental state is and all that sort of thing.

**Speaker A:** Right. That's correct. So let's add the next line. And most people are out of control and they don't even recognize that they can be in control. That's the real issue is, is that it's never the job. It's always how we feel about it and how we feel about it. Is either one or the other. It's either ordinary or it's noble. If it is an ordinary response, an ordinary feeling, then that means it comes out of your own past and our childhood, where we felt a sense of loss or a sense of gain or a sense of punishment, retributions, doing what we're told to do and all of that kind of stuff, our habits that build up so that that comes into this present moment. But then you have that choice. The choice is Sati. Are you going to take the choice to wake up, to wake up to how you feel about the job and to recognize, oh, you feel about the job the way that you feel about all jobs. You don't like them. You didn't like ABCs, you didn't like 1-2-3s, you didn't like Nichiren, you didn't like Shakespeare, you didn't like E=mc². You just really didn't like any of it. And, and, but we can always find out, oh, it really was Einstein's fault that I was no good at math because he made it too complicated.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, dismissal of responsibility.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, when we do recognize 100% that we actually feel the way that we have, let us say, been trained to feel, rather than feeling about the job because of the job. The job doesn't cause you to feel in a certain way.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's true.

**Speaker A:** That's true.

**Speaker B:** And I know that, I know that, but it's Yeah, it's true.

**Speaker A:** But do you yet know that then you have a choice about that, that if you can begin to control the way that you feel— Yeah, I come— You can approach that job in a more noble way, and that means that the job itself becomes more noble.

**Speaker B:** Yes, of course.

**Speaker A:** Because you're bringing the nobility into it intentionally, as opposed to hating it. Okay, guess what? Doesn't matter where you are, but let's just say that you, uh, this was years ago and you were on an automobile assembly line, and every time that you thought of hating your job, you just kind of drop a bolt off of that thing that you were screwing in. Screw it, you'd say, mentally, rather than screwing it in physically. All right, yes. And then later we begin to find out that all jalopies all over this area are falling apart because they didn't have all bolt screwed in,

**Speaker B:** right?

**Speaker A:** Right. However, a noble in that particular position would be, uh, hey, I'm having a blast, let me see how tight I can get these bolts. This is a lot of fun, I could do this, do it over and over and over again, I'm really good at it, I'm the best screwer in town. But his bolts are on tight and the jalopies don't fall apart. So that's an example then of taking a noble attitude to something winds up generally being high quality rather than slapdash.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yeah, when we kind of like devote ourselves entirely to that activity, the job becomes better, we feel better about the whole thing, we feel better about ourselves, everything's better. Basically.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Now, when we take something noble to the task, then that means that we are actually more honest with ourselves about the work that we're doing, which then means that we are now kind of bound to be more honest with the people that we're working with about the job that we're doing, including our customers. And so we're going to be more honest with them rather than relying upon regulators. The reason that we have regulators in the United States is because all of those employers are doing a business that's not noble. They need to be regulated because they're willing to cut corners, because they're doing it selfishly. They're not doing it for the greater good. So, like, for instance, Southern Pacific, I think, is it, a paper products company in Georgia owned by the Koch brothers. They make all kinds of diapers and whatnot, products and whatnot. But nobody wants to live within 100 miles of that plant, especially down the river. Because they are— and so what do they do? They spend millions of dollars to keep themselves in political power so that they can maintain the mess that they're making. They work really hard to keep the regulators from doing their jobs. It's almost like they are intentionally harming people.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's a kind of greediness that's all kind of consuming them and destroying everything around.

**Speaker A:** Right. And so anyone who would work at then this place Southern Pacific that know that the owners of it are intentionally polluting and doing it big time, that would weigh on their hearts and they would wonder, do I actually want to work for a company that I know the dirt on? Can I find a clean, wholesome company whose management has got the better good, the greater good at heart, rather than— and in this particular case, actually working very hard to make sure that they're screwing people?

**Speaker B:** Yes. Yeah, a lot of effort in that, right?

**Speaker A:** There's a lot of effort in the oil industry to lie to people. And to harm them. And so that some occupations, like politics and whatnot— and in fact, you could go so far as to see that you have ordinary people with ordinary wealth, including up into the middle class, and then you have people who are really, really greedy with money, many of them the money was inherited, or at least a great portion of it was inherited, which means that now the individual, when he's in charge of all of that money, he's actually competing with Daddy for what— who can be the biggest asshole in the world. Because he learned how to be an asshole from his dad, who was being an asshole to all of these people collecting all of this money. And now Junior's got to be even a bigger asshole than and Daddy. Okay, many examples of that, but Donald Trump comes to mind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I see. Yeah,

**Speaker A:** but, um, uh, Gates, uh, not, not Bill Gates, the other one in Florida, he also comes to mind because his daddy was a major politician making all kinds of trouble So now, this Gates has to be even worse than his dad. And so, these are the kind of people, and for some reason or another, they're the ones who always are the most wealthy. You could go so far as to say that wealth and power corrupt ultimately, even if it's not ultimate power and ultimate wealth, it will ultimately, eventually corrupt. Because the money and the power become important rather than the general welfare.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And so the guys who are trying to accumulate all their money, all that money, are operating under a form of ignorance. And that ignorance is, I'll feel better if I get more money. They never— more money comes and they feel a little bit better for a little short time, and then they want money again. It's almost like an addiction that they've got to have more and more and more because it's not ever enough, okay? But when you're practicing nobly in the business world, that means that this transaction is good enough, this is fine, okay? That whatever happens will be okay. And so we wind up not competing so much. So we could say then that any job that you have to compete in is probably not the right attitude, not the right livelihood for the individual who is compelled to compete.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** It's almost like, you know, in school they talk about two kinds of games: competitive games that have scores and winning, and then they have non-competitive games where everybody's happy and there's no score being kept. That would be a win-win situation. Guess what? Capitalism don't do that. Capitalism is all about scoring points and winning and taking and grabbing and taking advantage, etc., like that. So you could go so far then as to say that capitalism itself is in danger of being wrong livelihood.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I can see that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** But that doesn't mean that you have to quit capitalism completely. You could certainly move over to the side, right, with it being a major player in the game. So moving to the side of capitalism so that we can find a place where we can find comfort and security and also doing someone some good, some value. That another way of saying it, in fact, going back to the Eightfold Noble Path, that Right Livelihood is the last item on the list, because it should be the last item that's actually cleaned up. That all of the rest of the Eightfold Noble Path is in fact getting one ready, including that getting our mind organized and getting the mind unified—Samma, Arya, Samatha—that puts us in the position of being free from want or free from desire. So if you don't want anything, you're likely to not kill anybody for it. Okay, and if your mind is pure and clear, you're unlikely to steal something from anybody, just in the normal context. Now, put it into the sense of Right Livelihood, and we can put it back into that context. If the mind is noble, then we're not going to intentionally take advantage of people with this buying and selling, shysterism, tricks of the trade, pulling a fast one, giving specifications for one grade of concrete and then pouring a lower grade, you know.

**Speaker B:** Happens so much, feels like.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so a lot of it then has to do with honesty and our own mind, and also it has to do with how we're going to deal with others, which means that if you are in a business or a situation to where you have to continuously deal with a shyster or a crook or someone who's lying all the time, it is better to find another place to do business. Okay, just like going back to the bar, if you're sitting there with a drunk at the bar, the likelihood is that you're going to get drunk sitting there with him.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's the sort of thing that I mean when it feels like everything in life is like a practice or an opportunity to cultivate something. Those kinds of circumstances and situations that we find ourselves in sometimes in our jobs tend to like be directed to cultivate a particular kind of thing, like being at the bar, or, you know, right, kind of like cultivates this,

**Speaker A:** uh,

**Speaker B:** uh, like this, this— it's a practice of like being more— it's like, it's like we're practicing getting that sip of alcohol, uh, you know, slowly, slowly, a little bit every day, that sort of thing. And yeah, it seems quite— well, limiting beliefs, I suppose. But it is quite hard to find a place where— well, we do our best, I suppose— but to find a place where we can cultivate that, where like a place where like the actual boss and that sort of thing has this sort of mentality and this sort of will to have this environment at work and that sort of thing. But of course, fundamentally all comes from us first, first and last. But yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yes, so that basically means that it's a one-two punch or a two-step. First, we clean out the inside, and only after we have the inside cleaned out, at least for the moment, at least for the moment, not long-term. It's not like, oh, I've got to have 10 years experience of absolute pure mind before I'm allowed to go to 7-Eleven. No, but in the moment when the mind is clear and we can see That's the time that we actually look closely, and it's also the time that when we've got the inside cleaned up, that we could go back and then operate on the outside nobly for at least a short period of time, until— what is the Latin phrase? Illegitimate con, uh, carborandum. Okay, which is actually— it's fake Latin, but what it translates to is, uh, the illegitimate is actually, uh, a better word for it, but it's translated into bastards. Don't let the bastards grind you down. If you've gotten yourself up to a noble point, you need to find an occupation where the bastards are not going to grind you down. Okay, now the word is actually illegitimate rather than bastard. And so we can say that, uh, that that's actually a better word to use because when we understand illegitimate, that means that the nobility is legitimate and the ordinary is illegitimate. It's not really up to scratch because it's always kind of looking for a way to take an advantage. Yes, it's capitalism, by the way, and that's what capitalism is all about, is finding a way of taking advantage. Yeah, so the Republicans are trying to take advantage of the Democrats, Democrats trying to take advantage of the Republicans, and the rich are trying to take advantage of the poor, and the poor trying to take advantage of the guy who's not looking. Okay, so this is, this is what it's all about, is, uh, this, uh, we think that Right livelihood means then that we've got to get something, we've got to have some advantage, because everybody else is out there trying to get an advantage, or trying to cut corners or get something. It's almost like the distinction between, I only want to win when the win is absolutely legitimate. In other words, I can prove, and my own friends can prove that I won that one fair and square. That's one attitude. That's kind of a noble attitude, that I'm going to win this thing, but I'm going to win it right. Okay, I'm even going to give my opponent an extra few advantages just to prove that I'm that much better than he is. Okay, but the ignoble way, like Donald Trump again, would be winning at any cost, that the win is the important thing not the playing of the game. So for the noble, playing the game is it. The winning is irrelevant because he's already won.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the whole activity is the point, not the— not the activity of the

**Speaker A:** Dharma teaching, not the winning and the losing and who got all the money.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so with this then, we can kind of make a new view of right, noble livelihood and change it into something that has a little bit more meaning, and that is right, noble lifestyle. The way that we live our lives is based upon the noble mind of being free from want, free from worry, free from desires for things, and therefore or not needing to take advantage of anyone. And that when people see that, they can appreciate it, that it's almost like finally they found somebody that they can actually trust, because everybody else they ever met is trying to take advantage of them, right? And so this is the way that we want to start having a lifestyle. The lifestyle is, is that we do everything up front with nobility shining.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** And with that nobility shining, then people pick up on that and they start to become noble also. It's just like joy. It's really, really hard to maintain anger when you've got a whole bunch of people teasing you. Hmm, right. Okay, or even if you've got one jolly guy who's there, one person spreads joy everywhere. It's almost like a Johnny Appleseed.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, it really is.

**Speaker A:** And so this is the way that we want to approach our lives so that we have the lifestyle that then just kind of fits into the livelihood thing. But really what we're doing is not so important as are we enjoying it? I've even gone so far to tell a couple of the students is that you're being friends with all of the people at your company is the only job that you've got.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I can certainly see that because it creates such a nice mental space to be in. When that happens.

**Speaker A:** So that the actual job that you have to do is secondary, that the primary job is to be friendly and happy with everybody— janitors, the nerds, the freak show, everybody,

**Speaker B:** right?

**Speaker A:** That in fact is everybody at work is, um, is appointing to Metta in the sense of the four points of the— or the six points of the compass. Have you ever heard of the six points of the compass when in reference to Metta?

**Speaker B:** I have not.

**Speaker A:** Okay, the six points of the compass in Western mind, the compass is pointing north, therefore north and the North Star, and on and on and on. North is really north to where in these, uh, the six points of the compass, uh, in the old time of the Buddha, they're talking about the meta of the people who are right in front. Those are the people that we do business with, that we associate with, we are at work. Then on one side we have our friends, on the other side we have the family. Behind us are the people that we've either turned our back on or the people who are trying to stab us in the back. The people above us are the people that we ourselves consider authorities. Many people will see cops and priests and politicians and whatnot. Very rich people, bosses, that kind of stuff would be above us. And then the people below us are the ones who actually help us and are servants to us, including cashiers, table waiters, and those kind of people, people who pump gas only in Oregon and in Thailand. Do you get gas pumps? But there are people who do that. And so we have to treat them well. Now, this is completely different than the Western mentality when they say, may all beings be happy, because all beings in that situation is just a concept. So when I'm talking about, say, the company that you work for, well, it might be a really, really big company and you've got an assembly plant in let us say Nevada and one in Texas. Well, if you're in the plant in Nevada, then your world is going to be that plant in Nevada and the people that you're likely to run into there. You don't have to worry about making the people in Texas happy. They're not in your world. That's how we're beginning to look at it, is that your world is only as big as you have fingerprints. Or another way of saying it is your world is actually the world that you personally can sense. With your eyes and with your ears and with your touch, you can touch people. The people that you can touch are in your world. The people that you cannot even touch or even see are just merely mental concepts for you. And so those are not the ones that we're talking about. We're actually talking about not having Metta or loving-kindness for everybody, because that's too much. I mean, if we can't even make the people around us happy, how in the hell can we make people we don't even know happy? Right, especially when so many of them were just downright refusing to be happy.

**Speaker B:** Right, yes, that is true. Actually, now that you're talking about this, I recall seeing, and I think it was actually a video on YouTube from you as well, with the talk about Metta with someone else, where you talk about the six directions. And then when you start to talk about that, I reminded, oh, I remember this. I remember this. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So we can think of that six directions because every job that you will have, I mean, even the mechanic will have people below him and above him and people around on all four sides of him. And even the new hires will have people below them if they look down on anybody, even if it's just the, let us say, the lunch machine. The sandwich machine. Okay, right. And so we all have all six directions, and we deal with things in all six directions. And in many cases, especially at work, we can think of that these six directions are not necessarily human. Sometimes they're human substitutes. I mean, how many people hate robots and they've never seen a robot? They just hate the concept, or maybe all they've seen is a video of a robot for about 10 seconds, but they haven't maintained a robot for employment, let's say. So this idea then is beginning to treat the world in the way that we're radiating joy. But you've got to have a central core of joy in order for it to radiate. It's almost like the lighthouse is not going to show the ship where the rocks are if the lighthouse can't even get its own lights on.

**Speaker B:** Right, yeah. And boy, isn't that nice to be joyful? Yeah, I suppose that's where our daily practice and our constant appliance of Sati and our awareness of all of our states and so on. I suppose it kind of starts there and then we can kind of like spread that to any place that we're in, to our job and our co-workers and the people we interact with and that sort of thing.

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly. That's, that's the way that you, you do it. So the, the sequence of events then is literally to get away from it all, get into seclusion. There, after we've gotten into seclusion, we figure out that, oh, I'm not really in seclusion. I brought all of that mess with me. Even though I, I left it to avoid it, I brought it with me anyway.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** A clear example of that on a longer time frame is the young man who as a teen or a 20-year-old hates his dad. Only when he's 40 does he recognize that he's just like his dad.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that, yeah, even in myself I see that a little bit.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so getting away from it all is not getting away from it all. Is recognizing what a burden we've got. It's almost like the fish when it's out of water, he recognizes what water was, because he's got none of it now. This is also the concept of Sunyata, is to look at the emptiness, to recognize what's there and what's not there. And so now we have the job of cleaning the mind or cleaning house, but we want to do that without having someone else dumping a garden or garbage tip, a garbage dumpster full of crap on us all the time when we're trying to clean out. No, we actually want to get it clean. We want to find out what it's like to have a mind really clean. And that's the part of the seclusion, is to get away from it all, get dried out. Get set on fire with the Dharma, and then we can go back into the rain and still have a parade.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah, when we develop that space, that mental space, then we can be independent of circumstances and be joyful just the same.

**Speaker A:** And that's when we can actually now start looking at it at a little deeper level Is it this job that I need? But we're only looking at that from the wholesome. This is an important part because everybody who's going to come and ask this kind of question is already coming with the point that they're dissatisfied with the job, and so they're going to have confirmation bias. Yeah, but when we clean that confirmation bias out and take a really, really good, fair, clean look Now we can see things clearly and really address the issue correctly and properly: Is this a job fit for a noble? Guess what? All kinds of jobs are fit for a noble in the right circumstances. Janitorial jobs are in fact some of the noblest jobs I know. Many janitors, for instance, in schools have kept kids from committing suicide. The chef in South Park. He's the only noble thing in that whole show. And yet he is a nothing to the people in the town. He only means something to the kids in the school. So this is what I mean, like, that a cook, a janitor in an organization can sometimes be the most noble person in the whole outfit.

**Speaker B:** Bit. Mm-hmm. I can certainly see that. Yes.

**Speaker A:** And also it's possible for the boss to be noble, but that's so rare.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that is right. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But sometimes organizations themselves, like a school, has a noble intention to educate the kids. So working at a school as a janitor would be far superior to than being a used car salesman lying to customers about the condition of the cars that you're about to sell.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** All right. So this is how we're looking at it, that it's actually not the job itself so much as it's the approach that we have and the attitude for it. But once we get a really, really noble attitude Now we can see for sure what the Buddha meant by the stuff about, well, I'm not going to be making weapons because I know that that's harming people, and I'm here all gung-ho for not harming people, and here I am making the AK-47s, right? And so, but we also have the strength of mind and the self-assurance to say, well, I can go do anything that's noble. Noble, and I don't have to stand here and do something that's not noble. Yeah, okay. Now there's one more that I'll give you, and that is, is that the Buddha actually gave an example of a man who had a noble profession. What this guy did was— I mean, this is ancient India, and you've got all kinds of really strange beliefs that wound up as Anapanasati rules, like digging in the dirt and cutting grass or cutting limbs and all of that kind of stuff. So this is what was in India before. So the story is, is that this guy goes down to the riverside and finds a place where the sand and the mud have diggings where the otters or the rats or a snake or some animal has dug a burrow. And by digging it out the way that they're digging it out, the mud and the sand more or less disconnect with each other. And all he has to do is to pick up a handful of mud and he goes down, up and down and picks up the mud. He then takes that mud and puts it in water to get this and filters the sand out of it. But then he uses that mud as objects that he makes clay pots and dishes and items like that, cures them in the sun. He makes it and he puts it out in the sun, and then in front of his hut where all of this stuff is drying in the sun, there's a sign that says, take what you want and pay me what it's worth to you. And with that, that was his job, and he actually supported his family, including his mother. Now that's the Buddha story, because he didn't even dig in the dirt. He just picked up the mud. That's all he did, was he just picked the mud up, and that was discarded by some animal. So that would be, um, right livelihood in the sense of taking something. But he also didn't charge money, nor did he even advertise. He just had a sign up saying, take what you will and pay what you think it's worth. And as he got pretty good at it, I imagine the quality of his merchandise got very good. He didn't have to sell anything. He just spent his time, you know, making pottery. It was early in the morning, he'd go get the mud, and then all day he would have the pottery dry with nothing to do and no place to go. He had a really nice life.

**Speaker B:** Boy, doesn't that sound lovely? Quite lovely.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Well, if we all lived that kind of lifestyle, then there would be enough mud laying around for us to have a nice lifestyle. The problem is that some guys want all the mud, right?

**Speaker B:** That's true. Yep.

**Speaker A:** So, um, that's, that's the whole point then, is one's right livelihood or right lifestyle has to do with the condition of one's mind. And very little else.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like everything else, right? Yeah, of course, it's all about the mental space. It becomes quite obvious. Like, sometimes it's, yeah, when we catch ourselves and we can notice that is indeed the case, it's so obvious.

**Speaker A:** It really is. So now we've gotten a bunch of examples of things that we can see would be wrong livelihood just by looking at them, things that actually harm people. Making, manufacturing weapons, selling poison, selling alcohol is also generally listed on one of those not-to-do lists. So bar owners, and in fact, I can't think of a more confused role than a bar owner. That's a really confused role. Why? Because in some states, he's got a really noble obligation to dry out the drunks as well as moan with them when they're having a pity party, calling the right sort of organizations that can come and give this guy help, social workers and whatnot like that. But he's also most of them are not interested in the social aspects of the job and how they can help people. They're just interested in getting the money.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So that's a rare case of a bartender who has a nobly run bar. That's unlikely. In fact, if that noble guy inherited a bar or somehow it fell off upon him the ownership of it, let's say his brother died. His brother was the bar owner and he was just left with the bar. Okay. The thing then for him to do would be to find a way of converting that business out of selling alcohol into selling something like fruit shakes or something else like that. So he could make an arrangement so that the business was not so dangerous. If that's the mindset that he has. If the mindset is, is that you're going to be here to help people and to add to the society, and the reason that we wouldn't do that is because we've already got enough, we're overflowing with life. Most people, even if they've got millions and millions, even billions of dollars, is not enough. They still feel empty.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, never ends. What about like just a quick curiosity that just came to mind? What about like the— how does right livelihood apply to people like monks, for example? Um, how does that apply to them? Is it about like the— I don't know, like the way of like the alms rounds and that sort of thing? Or I don't know how that would work? Just a funny curiosity. I know it's—

**Speaker A:** I have actually been there and done that experimentally on Saturday mornings at 7 o'clock in the morning on Saturdays, going down to Trade and Tryon in downtown Charlotte, North Carolina, in the business district and go on vendabat. I don't know why the guy wanted to go there, but the abbot wanted to go there. I think it was more of a show. But surprisingly enough, there were just enough bakeries and things open, and people brought stuff out. They weren't Buddhist at all, but they were impressed that the Buddhist monks were in downtown Charlotte, North Carolina on a Saturday morning. Okay, but there's not much vendabat done. That in fact the bendabout that's done in the United States is often done right there at the wat, and that people will come and bring their stuff to give to the monks at the wat. That's not true here. Here in Thailand, any morning that you get up early enough to go outside at 7 in the morning and go from here to Thong Sala, 12 kilometers, and just start counting the monks. I see, because they're out and it's part of the culture. It's been a part of the culture, and I can see that the way that the culture got started was not because of one monk leaving India and going to China or Burma or Thailand or whatever like that, that he actually went in groups, that when they, when they traveled, they took the whole show. What do I mean, the whole show? The Triple Gem, the whole show. You got a Buddha in this crowd, you got the Dharma in all of these monks, and you've got a Sangha here. You've really got a Sangha. And that Sangha then, that traveling artillery section of Sangha, then can go into these places and disperse, and one of them will get enough stuff so that he can come back and feed everybody. Everybody, and then they all know which neighborhoods to go to.

**Speaker B:** I see.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so when you've got a group of people, we can figure that out. Now, Wat Soi Mokkh is really interesting because there's at least 20 different paths that monks go on, and that they kind of line up at the gate. But then I found out from one of my students that at Dom Kiem, they have a completely different route because they open they go out from Dam Kiem and then they walk along— it's actually a berm that was created by digging a trench or a canal. And so, but the monks have been on top of this berm for so long that it's just a pathway that takes them down to the river. And at the river is houses and whatnot. So they walk about 2 kilometers to get down to these houses and to do Venerable Bhikkhuni and then come back. And that one of the things that Ajahn Metteyya does when he's going on Venerable Bhikkhuni like that, that in fact, Dhammarato is a training monastery for Westerners. And so he'll have 4 or 5 Westerners as well as a couple of monks to go on this Venerable Bhikkhuni. Well, that's very, very traditional in Thailand. They actually have particular names. One would be luksit if he's actually a student of the Arahant, and the other one is a funny word, is kapow. And the word kapow is used for the word pocket or purse or even wallet. Okay. And so the kapow is the guy who is there with the monks, and his job is to carry all of the stuff that the monks wouldn't carry if they were alone. And so when the laypeople see a kapow, with the monks, they go get all the stuff that they would have thrown in the trash or whatever and bring it out and give it to him, which means now everybody can eat.

**Speaker B:** I think I've seen videos of like in Thailand and in monasteries and monks and stuff like that, and I do remember seeing like, so like the person would put the alms round on the bowl of the monk and then there would be another person on the side of the monk that would, that would like then pick that up and put it there.

**Speaker A:** That's the kapow, that's him.

**Speaker B:** Ah, I see, I see.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's his job. And he goes along with the monks if there's one or two. I've also seen a few, let us say, a whole line of monks, one after another, and it may be as many as 20 or 30 monks, and they're going down through this area where where the people are then giving food out. And it's almost like that everybody's got a little bit of food to give. And as the monks are passing down these rows of people putting stuff, sometimes you'll see the arm of the Kapal reach out and grab something rather than it be put into someone's bowl. So sometimes you have a hope, but when there's a lot of monks in a line like that, this is almost almost always a ceremony that people have collected there to do that intentionally, just like they do at the Watts here in the United— or when they was in the US when they did it there. But most of the mornings is going to be 3 or 4 monks and 1 or 2 kapow, or maybe in the case that I was saying with Dhammarato, as many as say 4 monks and 5 Anapanasati, and so on. But that's it. That's 9. That's quite a— that's quite a lot for a village to handle.

**Speaker B:** I see.

**Speaker A:** And so, uh, that's only kind of the outside of it. But these, these people in that area know why, uh, there's more kapow than there are monks, right?

**Speaker B:** They're already familiarized with all of it, right?

**Speaker A:** Because they're, they're there for training. They are monks in training.

**Speaker B:** I see.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so it's part of the culture here, and it's not part of the culture in the West, and it never will be because the monks who are in the West were invited to the West by the refugees from various countries. And then those refugees that are living in the West, in the United States, will take care of those monks, and so the monks don't have to go out on vendabat unless they're just being adventurous or whatever, like we do sometimes. I mean, it's actually a good idea just to get out and go vendabat because that's how they're known in Thailand, is monks out in the morning going on vendabat. So going out and we can expect to get nothing and be surprised. But if you're expecting to get a whole meal, you're probably going to be disappointed. So it's better just to go go out with the exercise of just going out and not care too much about what you're going to get. And you have to plan your places carefully also for that. But basically what we're talking about then is there is skill built into the bendabat. There's a lot of skill built into it so that it's a cooperation between the people. In fact, you could go so far as to say that the garbage disposal department in Thailand wears orange because they come every morning and collect food scraps.

**Speaker B:** I see.

**Speaker A:** But they don't take plastic much, and they don't take empty water bottles. That you have to have somebody else. But if food scraps, yeah, we've got monks, they come and take all of that stuff away.

**Speaker B:** I see, right.

**Speaker A:** Now there's another one that's kind of funny about that, and that is that Wat Chulabhatan, which is the largest wat— well, it was 40 years ago. I assume it's still the largest wat in Thailand. Achan Pañña Nanda was the abbot at that time, and he was a great fan and big friend of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. So Wat Chulabhatan, when you talk about Wat Chulabhatan, that's almost talking the same as if it's Wat Suwan Mokkh, except that Wat Suwan Mokkh would have at most 400 monks. Wat Tulapatthan, 2,000, sometimes 3,000 monks. I mean, this place is no slouch. It's a huge place. And in those days, and I think that later the school was moved, but in those days, in the mid-1980s, there was a huge school for kids that was beside the property of the wat. On the other side of the highway was a huge, huge slum, and the monks would go off into the slum. And when I'm saying slum, it wasn't necessarily dirty and filthy, but it was very poorly constructed buildings with low-hanging roofs and that kind of stuff. And so we go off into this area for And the monks who go out into that area from Wat Tulapatthan by the hundreds come loaded down every morning with so much stuff that they can't carry it all. And so then the monks sit around and have breakfast together, and then all the stuff that they can't use gets put into great big washtubs. And then the, then the kapow that are there at the temple take all of these washtubs, put them on the back of the truck, take them down the road, and give them to the school. What I'm saying is that in Hinayana, in this particular situation, the moms and dads fed their kids every day at lunch at the school by giving the lunch and not giving it to the kids; they gave it to the monks. Knowing that it didn't have a particular label, this is from my mommy to this child, but rather that all the food that's coming out of this place is first fed by the monks and then they feed all the kids in the school.

**Speaker B:** And that was— comes around— this, this

**Speaker A:** is just, I mean, this is Thailand. You do not find that kind of thing in the United States, right? And so there's a kind of a generous spirit that has to do with being around the monks. The monks promote generosity. That's the right livelihood of the monk then, is that they promote generosity.

**Speaker B:** Isn't that a lovely livelihood to have?

**Speaker A:** What a lovely livelihood that is.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I don't know how late it is for you,

**Speaker A:** but close to 4:30.

**Speaker B:** I have another question, but I don't know if it's too late, if it's like better for another day or not. It's about Mudita and I suppose— Mudita. Mudita.

**Speaker A:** Mudita.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And we have been talking about Mudita for the past hour.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, yes, exactly.

**Speaker A:** That's it. The attitude of generosity and gratitude is the hallmark of Mudita. Yes, it is referred to in English— the translation is sympathetic joy. But the ordinary way of talking about it is the way that the Buddha says that he can find pleasure anywhere, so anybody who's got any joy, yeah, let me come get a teaspoon of it, because it's dripping out. But really Mudita has to do more with you sharing your joy, the sympathetic vibration is basically what you could say is whatever note is playing the loudest, all the musical instruments tend to pick up and vibrate at that frequency. Many examples of that. One of them is Rebel Rousing. Another one is in Shelley's book on Frankenstein. At the end of the book, everybody in the village is absolutely terrified of this monster and one guy gets brave and he says, we can do it, we can take care of that guy, and he rips up that mob and they go get their Frankenstein. Okay, because one guy can change everybody's attitude. This is Mudita— whoever's got the strongest voice. Well, guess what? In our society in the West, normally the strongest voice is the one who's the angriest or the one who's the most afraid. And so if you've got somebody really afraid about all the stuff that can go bad, he's going to make everybody afraid because he's shouting at the top of his lungs. And as he's saying, it's

**Speaker B:** a crackpot. So is there any, um, well, is there any, uh, like, um, say, a particular way to like, to like practice

**Speaker A:** this kind of— Okay, I've been waiting for you to ask to get it all out. All right, so here, yes, here's the answer. Think of it like this. Have you ever heard of people bringing a knife to a gunfight?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, knowing that, you've got to start taking an atomic bomb to every fight. Right, right. What is that? Explosive joy,

**Speaker B:** right?

**Speaker A:** You got to overpower them, okay? Um, you've heard the phrase, a teaspoon of sugar will help the medicine go down. A spoonful of sugar will help the medicine go down, right? Okay, that's the point of Mudita. Is if we start adding sugar, it helps the medicine go down. No guarantee, but in some cases we need a ton of sugar to get one pill in, right? Especially if we're trying to get it down the throat of someone who's really pissed off, really angry, right? Okay. And so normally what people will do who have a little bit of Mudita, a little bit of sympathy Anapanasati joy, they'll go and get completely overwhelmed and overtaken by the angry one. And then they'll slink off and say, well, it's better to have seclusion than it is to be in that.

**Speaker B:** Hmm. Yes.

**Speaker A:** But if he's off in seclusion and he really gets some joy going, then even though this guy is really angry, our joy comes right in and keeps coming in and keeps coming in. And it will wear down that, that anger if we have enough joy. And not only that, but in this situation you could say that at least 90% of that spoonful of sugar is getting wasted anyway because we're just slinging it all over the place. And so we need a lot of it. We need a lot of ammunition. You need a lot of ammunition if you're going to overpower other people's bad feelings with your good feelings. But it can be done. I've seen it happen many, many times.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yeah, I think I've seen that too, and yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** So that's what Mudita is, that in fact you can see the sequence is that if we have kindness for other people and we can see the situation that they're in, instead of jumping into that situation ourselves. And misery loves company.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** Angry people want you to be angry.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that is true.

**Speaker A:** People who are weeping and poor me's, they want you to be there. They're now always going to be all right. I mean, this was it. He was so bad to you. Oh, he hurt your feelings so badly. You know, that kind of stuff. You feel you have every right to be as mopey and as unhappy as you are. He really hurt you. He really dumped upon you, and it's terrible.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And you could go the same way, and I know that people won't like it when I say it like that, is that, oh, you feel really bad because your son died. When he was alive, you didn't like him very much, but now that he's dead, look at the old poor me. Oh, my son died. Hmm. All right, so get ourselves into pity parties, and that The right way to handle that through compassion is with Mudita, that you don't agree with them. That when somebody's son dies, you don't sit down and say, "Oh, my daughter just died, let's have a pity party together, we can communicate and connect."

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** That's not the right way to do it because now you've got two people in a pity party.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it doesn't help anyone to leave that state.

**Speaker A:** So Mudita means is that it doesn't matter how unhappy, sad, depressed, angry, or whatever someone else is, if you're going to deal with them, you've got to deal with them with enough joy to overpower whatever bad feelings that they have. And you have to stay there and rub it in and rub it in and rub it in until they come out of their state.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And sometimes they get really stuck into it. They're bound and determined. You're not going to get them out of it.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, that's quite a— it's like most people, I would say. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And, and so, um, more sugar please, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. There seems to be some— well, I don't know, it seems to be like some kind of like threshold as well, that like we can't— that like after we do it and we do our best and in a kind and loving way, and then it just never seems to work, then at some point Like, do we just like take a break? Because at some point it feels like

**Speaker A:** even that— that's what I mentioned, that if you do not have the joy to manage this bad feeling, then the right thing to do is say, oh, excuse me, I've got to go to the bathroom right now.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And then the bathroom you find happens to be 5 kilometers from here.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So we return ourselves back to seclusion. And we cultivate the happy states again, and then we go back at it again.

**Speaker A:** And then you go back at it again and treat it as a training exercise. Other people's bad feelings is a training exercise, just like your own bad feelings were before a training exercise, except now you have the skills that you need to deal with it.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm, right.

**Speaker A:** You develop those skills getting rid of your own bad feelings. Now you can happily deal with other bad feelings without having to feel bad yourself, that you've got the power now. But that's the right attitude. The attitude is, is I can maintain my cool no matter what,

**Speaker B:** right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, no matter how hot they get, no matter how— what temperature they glow at, I want to maintain cool. That's Mudita.

**Speaker B:** And I've heard, I think I've heard as well somewhere, or seen written somewhere, that it is the antidote to jealousy. Is that true, or am I confusing it with Karuna?

**Speaker A:** At an ordinary level, yes, that's true. That's the beginning. That's when your fellow employee gets the job to be the boss that you wanted. Okay, if you were competing with him for that job and he got it, now he's going to be your boss. If you continue in that, being jealous of him about that, it's going to affect your work performance and he's going to affect his attitude towards you. If, however, you can get your mind together enough, you'll go and invite him out. And in fact, the whole work group to lunch, and you pay for it, congratulating him. I'm so happy that you got it. Boy, I wanted that job, but now that you've got it, I don't want it at all. And so you give him that job. You are sympathetically joyful for him, because if you don't, you're going to get fired by staying jealous. Then you really will feel bad. Not only did you not get the job, but the guy who got the job fired you. And I don't even know why he fired me. I was the best employee there. You know, is the kind of mentality we have. We will not accept the fact that our jealousy is what got us fired. And so yes, there is that element there. But if jealousy was never the issue for you anyway, that this is an ordinary situation, that somebody is just angry because they're angry, you know, it's got nothing to do with you, but you've got to deal with their anger. How are you going to deal with it? Joyfully,

**Speaker B:** right?

**Speaker A:** Just like you— how are you going to handle a very tense, dangerous situation like a traffic stop where the cop stops somebody? There you have— you look in your rearview mirror, red, blue, red, blue, red, blue, and you hear that, wow, whatever noise that they make. How do you feel? Yeah, all right. How do you feel? Normally people feel afraid and uptight, and by the time the cop gets to the door they're freaked out. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And so the cop picks up on that, and so now you've got two people afraid. But if you've got presence of mind, if you've got— oh, I've got my Sati together. Yeah, it's a cop here, never mind. And so when he rolls— when you roll down, you went, hello officer, I'm really glad to see you guys out tonight. I was feeling really safe and secure knowing that I've got good cops on duty. Thank you, sir, for your service. Now what can I do for you?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** With that kind of attitude, you're less likely to get a ticket. With that attitude, you're much less likely to get shot.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so there, that's Mudita for you right there. And okay, got nothing to do with jealousy, but it has to do with do you have the joy to spread it around in a tense situation? But it can still be things, so they say.

**Speaker B:** It can still be used for that purpose, right, for the jealousy aspect. As well.

**Speaker A:** Actually, I would do that a little bit differently. Here's how I would do it. Jealousy. I'll be right back. Let me go take care of this jealousy. I don't need to be here with jealousy trying to fix it up while you're watching me be jealous and try to get over it. No, I'll go take a hike. I'll go do that in private. I'll get over it.

**Speaker B:** I see.

**Speaker A:** Go into seclusion with jealousy, and when we're over that stuff, then we can come back with full-blown Mudita.

**Speaker B:** I see. So we just do our regular practice of going back into seclusion and practicing wholesome happy states.

**Speaker A:** And so in that situation with that, then you could say that while the guy is being told that he's the new boss and you're standing there with all your jealousy and rage and all of that, the right thing to do is to slip off behind, go into the bathroom or down the hall or into the stairwell or something and take a few deep breaths and get over it. Yes, get yourself into seclusion and then go back in there. All happy that he's gotten the job.

**Speaker B:** I see, I see. Yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** Because the only other thing is, is to be jealous and get fired, right? He doesn't— or you could be his best friend, you can be his best buddy, you can help him be the best job and best boss in the whole place,

**Speaker B:** right?

**Speaker A:** By supporting him. Yeah, I mean, after all, you are even not even just as good as he is. You're better than he is. He just happened to have gotten the job, but that doesn't mean he won. I won. I'm the winner here.

**Speaker B:** Right, right. I see. Okay, okay. I think, I think I'll, uh, I'll have— I'll call you Somewhere soon, maybe next week or so, because I'll be doing a retreat in about a month, and I'd like to hear your thoughts on that as well.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. Also, where are you located?

**Speaker B:** I'm in Finland at the moment.

**Speaker A:** In Finland, okay. We have a UK Sangha that's 10 o'clock on Sunday mornings UK time, so whatever time it is in Finland, 11 or 12 or 1 or whatever like that, uh, feel free to join us. Do you have the link?

**Speaker B:** I do, actually. You, when you type that on Discord, uh, you type like a message saying that you responded to me, so that was a— so I was the person who asked. So, uh, actually, I'm aware, I'm aware, and I'll, I'll do my best to be there tomorrow.

**Speaker A:** So if you can, I'd like to see you.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, right. Thank you very much.

**Speaker A:** Well, we will see you soon. May your livelihood be enjoyable.

**Speaker B:** Yes, thank you, thank you very much.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and a Sangha friend (Speaker B, Johnny) is a deep, practical exploration of **Right Livelihood (Samma Ajiva)** from the Buddha's Noble Eightfold Path. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: Right Livelihood is About the Mind, Not Just the Job**
The central teaching is that Right Livelihood is less about a predefined list of "good" or "bad" jobs and more about **the mental attitude and ethical quality we bring to our work.** The "rightness" comes from our inner nobility, not the external activity itself.

### **Key Insights and Discussion Points:**

1.  **Beyond Rules and Lists:** The talk moves past a simplistic, legalistic view of Right Livelihood (e.g., "business is bad"). While the Buddha gave examples of harmful trades (weapons, poisons, intoxicants, slavery, butchering), the deeper principle is **whether an activity causes suffering (*dukkha*) for oneself or others.**

2.  **The Internal Gauge is Suffering:** The primary guide is to observe: **Does my livelihood cause me misery, stress, or suffering?** If it does, that's a signal. The first and often best solution is not to quit, but to **change your attitude** toward the work. Bringing mindfulness, joy, and nobility to a task transforms the experience of the task itself.

3.  **Environment Matters, But Mind is Supreme:** The discussion acknowledges that workplaces have a "flavor" or culture that can influence us (like a bar encouraging drinking). This is "guilt by association." However, the ultimate power lies in our mind. A "noble" person with a purified mind can maintain integrity and joy even in a challenging environment, though seeking a wholesome environment is wise.

4.  **The Essence is Non-Harm and Honesty:** Right Livelihood fundamentally means **not harming others and not being dishonest.** It's about moving away from a competitive, "taking advantage" mindset (linked to capitalism's downsides) toward a cooperative, honest, "win-win" approach. The example given is of a noble worker who tightens bolts with care and joy, versus one who does shoddy work out of resentment.

5.  **Right Livelihood is Right Lifestyle:** The concept expands into **"Right Noble Lifestyle."** It's about living from a mind free from excessive want, greed, and the need to exploit others. When you are joyful and secure within, you naturally radiate that, making your very presence beneficial to your workplace and turning your role into one of fostering goodwill (Metta).

6.  **Sequence of Practice:** The practical path is:
    *   First, **cultivate seclusion and inner peace** through meditation (like Anapanasati) to "clean the mind."
    *   From that place of clarity and joy, you can **re-engage with the world** and assess your work.
    *   With a noble mind, you can perform almost any job nobly (e.g., a janitor can be a beacon of support), or you will have the clarity to see if a job is fundamentally unethical and have the strength to leave.

7.  **Application of Mudita (Sympathetic Joy):** The latter part of the talk connects Right Livelihood to **Mudita**. The ideal attitude at work is one of joyful generosity, celebrating others' success (antidote to jealousy), and using your own cultivated joy to skillfully defuse tense or negative situations. You need a strong "core of joy" to share it effectively.

### **Memorable Examples & Analogies:**
*   **The Potter:** The Buddha's story of a man who used discarded mud to make pottery and let people pay what they wished, living a simple, honest, and joyful life.
*   **Tightening Bolts:** The contrast between the resentful worker creating faulty products and the joyful worker creating quality.
*   **Barfly vs. Pizza Delivery:** How environment influences but doesn't determine behavior.
*   **Monks' Alms Round (Vendabat):** Presented as the ideal Right Livelihood—promoting generosity, living simply, and creating a symbiotic relationship of support with the community.
*   **Atomic Bomb of Joy:** To overcome others' negativity, you need an overwhelming amount of your own cultivated joy (Mudita).

### **Conclusion:**
The talk reframes Right Livelihood from a restrictive rule into a **dynamic practice of mindfulness and ethics.** The answer to "Is this right livelihood?" is found not in a book, but by looking inward: **Does it cause suffering? Can I bring a noble, joyful, honest mind to it?** The ultimate goal is to develop a mind so peaceful and generous that your very way of being turns your livelihood into a path of practice and benefit for all.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors and stories** to explain the concept of Right Livelihood and related Buddhist principles. Here is a breakdown:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **The Forgotten Child:** Right Livelihood is described as a "forgotten child" of the Buddhist teachings—once discussed a lot (in the 70s/80s) but now often overlooked.
2.  **Mother's Milk:** A baby mooching off its parents is used as a metaphor for a child's natural "right livelihood"—it receives sustenance (mother's milk) through a consented, dependent relationship, causing no harm.
3.  **Sunyata (Emptiness):** A job itself is described as "empty" (Sunyata). It has no inherent nobility or annoyance; its quality depends entirely on what we bring to it.
4.  **Mental Clothing:** When starting a new job, people feel afraid because the "mental clothing" from their old job doesn't fit the new environment.
5.  **You are where you are:** Your environment shapes you. Examples given include:
    *   **The Barfly vs. The Pizza Delivery Boy:** The one immersed in the bar environment (the barfly) is more likely to develop associated habits (alcoholism).
    *   **Language Immersion:** To truly learn a language, you must immerse yourself in the culture where it's spoken.
    *   **Boot Camp:** The army submerges recruits into its culture to shape them.
6.  **Guilt by Association / Accomplice:** Being in a harmful environment or with harmful people makes you complicit, similar to being an "accomplice to a crime."
7.  **The Highway to Hell:** The path to negative outcomes is "paved with good intentions," but if you maintain good intentions and develop skill, you can pass through that hell to a better place.
8.  **Johnny Appleseed:** A person with a joyful, noble attitude spreads it everywhere they go, like Johnny Appleseed planting seeds.
9.  **The Lighthouse:** You can't guide others (radiate joy) if your own "light" isn't on. You must cultivate inner well-being first.
10. **The Fish Out of Water:** Only by removing yourself from a situation (like a fish out of water) can you truly recognize what that environment was like and what it contained.
11. **Bringing a Knife to a Gunfight / The Atomic Bomb:** To counter strong negative emotions in others, you need an overwhelming amount of positive energy (joy/Mudita). A little won't suffice.
12. **A Spoonful of Sugar:** Mudita (sympathetic joy) is like sugar that helps the "medicine" of a difficult interaction or truth go down. Sometimes you need a lot of sugar for one bitter pill.
13. **Competitive vs. Non-competitive Games:** Capitalism is likened to a competitive game with winners and losers, whereas a noble approach seeks "win-win" non-competitive games.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **The Buddha's List of Wrong Livelihoods:** The talk references the Buddha's list, specifically discussing "buying and selling" (as one concept, *vanijjā*) and trades in **weapons, poisons, and intoxicants** (e.g., modern gun manufacturers, polluting companies, bar owners).
2.  **The Mexican Government vs. U.S. Gun Manufacturers:** Cited as a modern example of "wrong livelihood"—businesses causing harm for profit, leading to real-world suffering and legal consequences.
3.  **The Slapdash vs. Noble Assembly Line Worker:**
    *   *Ordinary Attitude:* A worker who hates his job deliberately does poor work ("drops a bolt"), leading to faulty products (jalopies) down the line.
    *   *Noble Attitude:* A worker who brings joy and care to his task becomes "the best screwer in town," ensuring quality and safety.
4.  **The Polluting Paper Plant (Koch brothers):** An example of a company whose leadership's greedy, harmful intention creates an inherently unwholesome work environment and actively damages the community.
5.  **The Potter (Buddha's Story):** A man practices ideal Right Livelihood by:
    *   Using only mud already dug up by animals (causing no harm).
    *   Making pottery and leaving it out to dry.
    *   Putting up a sign: "Take what you want and pay me what it's worth to you."
    *   This story illustrates simplicity, non-harming, non-coercion, and trust.
6.  **Monks' Alms Round (Vendabhat) in Thailand:**
    *   Describes the symbiotic, generous system where monks collect food, promoting generosity in the community.
    *   The specific story of **Wat Chulalongkorn (Wat Tulapatthan)** illustrates this beautifully: monks collect excess food from a slum, eat what they need, and the rest is given to a nearby school, feeding the children. This shows Right Livelihood as a cycle of generosity that sustains the community.
7.  **Traffic Stop:** A story-like scenario where approaching a tense situation (being pulled over) with Mudita—calmly thanking the officer for their service—defuses tension and leads to a better outcome than reacting with fear.

### **Core Narrative Through-Line**
The conversation itself follows a **metaphorical journey**:
1.  **Cleaning the Inside:** The first step is compared to going into seclusion to "clean the mind" and develop inner joy and nobility (lighting your lighthouse).
2.  **Returning to the World:** Only with this inner stability can you return to the "rain" of the world without being extinguished.
3.  **Transforming the Environment:** You then assess your livelihood from this clear perspective. You can either leave a toxic environment or, more importantly, **bring your cultivated nobility into it**, transforming the job through your attitude and actions, and spreading joy like Johnny Appleseed.

These metaphors and stories collectively shift the understanding of Right Livelihood from a rigid list of "good and bad jobs" to a dynamic practice of **bringing a noble, harmless, and joyful mind to one's work and environment.**
