### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Yeah. Hey, Akshat, if you don't mind me asking just a quick thing before you— well, I started recording already. I was gonna ask you if you mind speaking a little bit about that experience of yours. If we— if you could ask a few questions about that, even if it's on recording.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's fine. I don't really care, just go ahead. Yeah, I can change the topic.

**Speaker A:** I want to talk about what Dhammarato was talking about.

**Speaker B:** We can get back to what I was talking about, but—.

**Speaker A:** It's a great topic, because as I was, if you recall last week we talked about, I asked about a series of videos, so where I could maybe get the hang of all of the things you've been doing lately. And you suggested that I would see your series of videos on YouTube. You recall that? And from this, from last week to now, I've seen about 5 videos of the 10 that are available. And I saw a clear difference between your personality from the first videos and the one I saw last week. It was so clear to me, the difference, that I immediately conceptualized that you must have touched Nibbana somehow, because the difference is very, very much perceptible, you know. So, I was planning to ask about that to you today. And when I come into the group, you were talking about that.

**Speaker B:** Well, in the videos, the clear difference that you see is, the only difference between the first videos and the difference that you see in the other videos, is not some unattainable magic thing that happened to me, but simply getting into a wholesome state with Dhammarato and getting on the same page as him and literally being in a state of mind that is free of craving and totally happy just to be right here in this call right now. And all of you guys, all all of you guys can do this, like right now with me. Like, if you can just sit here, listen to me talking, ask questions or whatever, but just be totally satisfied with the experience of just being on a voice call, and there's nothing to worry about right now, and just get on the same page as me, then you have access to that same experience of being free of Dukkha. And it's not special or extraordinary. So literally anyone can do it. And there's different tools and tricks, right? But the main thing that did it for me was just the enthusiasm around the Dharma. So my interest. Also, it's clear to see It's clear to see whether or not someone knows what they're talking about from all the signals and cues of that person. And I would say the main defining factor of whether you're in Jhana or not for most of the time is just the absence of restlessness. So can you sit here and just relax? It's that simple. Like, can you sit here and just be totally comfortable in your own body? Take a deep breath, right? That's why we do Anapanasati. You're literally breathing to relax the body. And if any problems come up, feel free to ask a question. So this is the simple instruction of what to do. Take deep breaths. If there's any tensions in your body, physically relax the tensions. So it's like when you go to bed at night, you have to go through a progression of relaxation of the body getting more and more relaxed, right? It's the same thing for meditation, except for we're fully awake during this process. So There's a big difference between sleepiness and tranquility. So tranquility, you have the full capacity to be hyper-aware of your immediate sensory experience. So in meditative states, instead of thinking about, oh, that guy at work, or You're, oh, that ex-girlfriend, she left me, or whatever it is that's making you feel bad. You're literally just hyper-aware of your immediate sensory phenomena. Like, an analogy I like to use is like a skilled hunter. So a skilled hunter walking in the forest, totally aware of his surroundings to the extent that he can hear a twig crunch in the leaves 20 yards away.

**Speaker A:** So that's not— and the Forest Ear Buddy is Ear Buddy.

**Speaker B:** And the what?

**Speaker A:** The forest is an analogy for your body.

**Speaker B:** Your body and all of your experiences.

**Speaker A:** So I can hear— Your mind too.

**Speaker B:** I can hear the rain hitting the windowsill behind me. I can see all of your faces. I can see the light coming through the window over there. I can feel the sensation of my butt against the seat, the feeling of my breath, my tongue, my forehead. All of these are the twigs in the forest. So you're the totality of your experience. And this is not quite the same as concentration, right? Because you're not just aware of one thing. So there's many things that are, quote unquote, the object of meditation. And the object of meditation is literally just the current experience that you're having. So whatever is going on in your mind is the object of meditation. Whatever is going on in your visual perceptual field is the object of meditation. Whatever is going on with the sensations of your breath is the object of meditation. Whatever is going on with the sounds is the object of meditation. Whatever is going on with any of your sensory experiences is meditation itself, as long as you don't conceptualize a past and a future. And you just stay here. And if there's Dukkha that comes up, analyze, analyze how that happens. Did you think about something in the past or the future? Because it can be very tricky. So you might think that you're doing meditation, but now you're thinking about doing meditation in the future, or whether you did meditation in the past. And that's not meditation, right? So that the idea that you're going to experience Nibbana sometime in the future if you only would just meditate correctly, or I need to get back into Jhana, or I'm going to experience the Jhanas in the future if I improve my meditation, is an illusion. That all is a fabrication of your own mind, because there is no Jhana in the future and there is no Nibbana in the future. If there's Nibbana, it's in the— it's right now. So that's why Nirvana is Samsara. It's just that you're either awake or you're asleep, but it's never in the future. And you can gladden your minds around the fact that you don't need to worry about anything. In the past or the future. So this is a wholesome thought. I could just sit here and be happy with absolutely nothing, not a care in the world. How amazing is that? What all the, all the lengths I went to to find satisfaction, and it turns out I don't need to do anything to be satisfied. I could just sit right here and be happy. That's the only trick. That's the only game of the universe. There's nobody more enlightened than you. There's no Buddhas. There's just the experience of reality as it unfolds moment to moment. And this experience operates by certain rules and certain causes and conditions that either produce dissatisfaction or produce satisfaction. The funny thing is I don't really know what First Jhana is. I can experience First Jhana, but if I try to think about what it actually is, That's just a concept in my mind. It's either the experience of first Jhana is the knowing of first Jhana. I can try to think about past experiences of Jhana, but that's just an afterimage I'm creating in my mind. And to realize the way that I got into Jhana to begin with was to let go of all of the striving, all of the wanting things to be different, and just stop. Just stop here in this moment and pay attention. Pay attention to what's going on. If you catch the mind making problems that aren't actually there, problems that aren't here in this room, you know that the mind is going off course again. I see you, Mara. Okay, it's playing tricks on you. Mara tries to play tricks on you to get you stuck in the cycle of it. Because he's very entertained by everyone going on the hamster wheel of Samsara. So to adopt the right attitude of a Noble One is to essentially take off the costume and stop being a clown for someone else's entertainment, and to find satisfaction, and to renounce all of the ways that don't really lead to satisfaction. All of the sensual desires, all of the pleasurable experience, even Jhanas, are all impermanent. So the only way to truly be satisfied is to stop wanting anything at all whatsoever, either spiritual or physical, mental or bodily. If anyone has a topic they want to talk about, we can continue to sit here in meditation. There's no agenda for this call, but If anyone has a question.

**Speaker A:** I'd like to ask a question, if you don't mind, about yourself. As I said, I'm on video 5 from this series of 10 on you. And I'd like to know if you don't mind saying it, when did you have this experience of changing of personality? Time-wise, I mean.

**Speaker B:** It gets kind of complicated because I have many experiences of changing personality because my personality changes all the time. I guess I don't really have a personality. So this is actually the first fetter. The first fetter is literally called personality view. Okay. And the personality view is the idea that you do have a continuous personality. Which, if we take a look at our actual direct experience, you will see that your thoughts and feelings and your personality isn't the same one moment to the next, let alone one day to the next, let alone one week to the next. So for me to pick out a change in personality is like, it's like taking a drop out of the ocean, doesn't really make sense. But, but there was a first time where I got into I got into Jhana through the method that Dhammarato prescribed to me. Up until that point, I was just doing do-nothing meditation. So completely passive. I wouldn't do anything about the activity of my own mind that was causing dukkha. And when I first called Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** He.

**Speaker B:** Gave me the practice to simply talk myself into it. So, and that's essentially what I do every Wednesday on a Sangha call. When I'm teaching you guys, I'm literally just talking myself into a wholesome state of mind. So it's beneficial for me and hopefully beneficial for other people too. But there's total indifference with regards to whether something lands.

**Speaker C:** Scott, you said earlier you don't know what it is, but you just explained what it is.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's You know, but I can't just— it's not as straightforward. It's not like a straightforward— especially in the beginning, you have to kind of trick yourself into being happy almost. Because you've been tricking yourself into being miserable for so long that it feels like a trick to actually just be satisfied. So because you've been talking yourself into feeling bad for so long, you have to start talking yourself into feeling good. And one day I was walking in the park, full of sorrow, lamentation, as per usual. And then I was like, you know what, let me try it. Let me try what he told me to do. And so I just talked myself into feeling happy. And then that initial rush I got from the realization that it's possible sort of developed like a feedback loop that just kept growing and growing. So it's almost like an empowerment rush. So it's the realization that You have the power within yourself to feel how you want to feel, and that's extremely liberating. And you become your own master. So you no longer have a God, you no longer have a master. And in that moment where you can be happy with nothing, you are the Emperor of the Universe. In that moment, you have what everyone wants. And nothing anyone does can take it away from you. And all the kings, all the richest people in the world, when they're not happy, don't have anything. And it's nothing compared to the direct experience of your own satisfaction.

**Speaker A:** So when was that?

**Speaker B:** I think it was after like the first or second call. I don't know, like you can look on the date it was published and it was around that general time. But I was saying beforehand, I had been practicing Advaita and like non-duality for probably like 3 years. So it wasn't like as if I'd never meditated before. But the maiden meditation I did was, oh, it's all one reality. And like, there wasn't really the right effort in the equation. But it did. I wouldn't say it was fruitless. So a lot of times practicing the idea that everything is non-dual, okay, there is no separate individual self. It can lead to similar themes, and there's definitely parallels between the Dhamma and Advaita. But the problem is the Advaita takes the self or your true nature to be a permanent, lasting ground of being that's continuous. And this is a barrier to Nibbana. So because there's just going to be some clinging for some self-identification left over, but it can get you into— if you really do Advaita to the full fruition of Advaita. It can get you into boundless Jhana territory. But you would mistake the boundless Jhana for enlightenment. But the boundless Jhana is not enlightenment because it's still something happening within. It's still a creation of the dream. It's still happening within the fabricated reality. So it's fundamentally limited. And there's nothing— these states are good states to be in. But the problem is it's impermanent. So when it's gone, you're going to be bringing up the past and clinging to the past, and you're going to, you're going to be identifying with it and wondering why the same results aren't happening. So you'll be, oh, I'm the self, I'm God, why am I suffering? And you'll be in a state of denial, and you'll just keep telling yourself the same lies over and over again. Nope, I'm God, there's no separate self. And you could see people, if you interact with most of these people in the community, they'll just get into lengthy arguments and stuff about it. And there's a lot of like mental gymnastics that goes into it. When actually the practice is so simple of literally just purifying your mind, relaxing the body, and not creating Dukkha for yourself unnecessarily. It's so simple. Just breathe. Just breathe and be here. All of this other stuff is just extra baggage. You're not trying to gain anything, you're trying to lose stuff that's weighing you down until you don't own a thing. So not owning anything Mentally, physically, in whatever way you can think about it, is a path to Awakening. I don't own your thoughts, don't own your feelings, don't take ownership of your body, don't take ownership of anything in the world, don't take ownership of any of your senses. And it will become clear to you that these are all impermanent, constantly changing, dreamlike almost.

**Speaker A:** Are you familiar with the 6R technique? That is some technique to help you let craving go.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I've heard of it, but.

**Speaker A:** At.

**Speaker B:** The end of the day, 6R, like.

**Speaker A:** It is understood as a kind of right effort, right?

**Speaker B:** Right. But I don't know all the Rs, but like, I don't think that you need that many Rs. You just need one. There's only one right effort. And the thing is, right effort isn't a formula that I could give you like a list of right effort things to do and check off the list. It doesn't really work like that. So it's like you kind of just do it. Sorry to say, but there's a story with the centipede, like this, somewhere in the sutta, and I haven't read it, but I heard Dhammarato tell it to me. And so they asked the centipede with 1,000 legs or 100 legs or whatever, How do you know how to move all your legs in perfect coordination? And which time do you move all the legs? And he's like, and then he says, I don't know, don't ask me that. I just do it. So the centipede doesn't know how it moves all the legs. It just moves the legs. Right effort is the same. So it's like nothing about 6 Rs or a step of things to do ever pops into my mind. It's just the simple act of breathing and practice being satisfied. There's some suttas that get into more detail about the Eightfold Noble Path. I forgot the title of the sutta, but The one that talks about how Right View comes first. So Right View is stopping and looking. So it's kind of like wakey wakey to things. You stop and you have to stop and look what's going on in order to make any changes about it.

**Speaker D:** I've heard of the 6 Rs before. I think there are some items that can be helpful. If you're not clinging to them, you know, and like, oh, have to follow the formula exactly. Again, like resmiling, smiling can be quite helpful, especially if you can just enjoy smiling for smiling's sake, if you will, or whatever. Just smiling right now in this moment is enough. You know, that can be quite helpful. I think there's some mind-body connection stuff going on with that as well that can be quite useful. With like the breathing, that can be quite marvelous. Yeah, in terms of gladdening both, you know, smiling with the body, gladdening up with the body, but also smiling with the mind, gladdening the mind, that can also, you know, kind of hitting both.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, just practice having a smile on your face. Try it. Even if you don't feel happy, just smile. Okay, just even the slightest smile is fine. Just make sure the ends of your— Arin, make sure there's a slight upturn on the ends of the mouth. And it requires— yeah, it just requires— sorry, go ahead. Yeah, it just takes a little bit of effort, right, to put a smile on your face. But then, before you know it, you actually are smiling, like you feel that you're smiling, you're happy. So it's the same thing we do with the thoughts. So it seems like, oh, I am, I'm not happy, like I'm, I'm not satisfied right now. But we just fake it to you, just think happy thoughts. And then eventually, uh, you get on a roll, one wholesome thought after another, and, uh, develops its own inertia. And that inertia becomes genuine and authentic. And, uh, when you cross that threshold, uh, now it's just a matter of being on the lookout for the first unwholesome thought that's going to take you out of it. So you watch, you're watchful, ever watchful, making sure that everything is going according to plan right now. And if an unwholesome thought pops up, you get better at sidestepping it, sideslipping like a boxer. Okay. And it just comes with practice. But yeah, it does take a little bit of effort. And that's what was missing with Advaita. So I started practicing doing this and the changes have been remarkable. And I, and also I've never looked back since. Because once I started getting the results, I realized this is the only way. This is the way. So that's kind of the end of doubt or going beyond doubt of, oh, is this the right thing to do? Is this the path?

**Speaker C:** How about this one? So You fold a paper airplane, right? You make it so its form is the way you know it will work, right? But then when you let go of it and it's flying, there's nobody folding it while it's flying.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** But it's still flying.

**Speaker B:** So that's a good one. Another good one is getting a car rolling from a dead stop. So let's say your car battery died. And I don't know if anyone drives a stick shift, but there's a way that you can get the stick shift to start simply by getting the car rolling, putting it into first gear, and then releasing the clutch and it starts the engine actually. So it takes a lot of effort to get that car rolling. But once you get rolling on like flat or slight slope, you hop in the front seat really quick and you just ride it. Jhana works the same way. So don't let up on the pushing until there's enough energy. So you have to keep applying and sustain wholesome thought, apply and sustain to build those wholesome feelings. Okay. Just push a little bit and hop in. It's going to stop very quickly. So you have to be relentless and keep going until there's an avalanche of good feelings. And when there's an avalanche of good feelings, you can just go, whoo! And just like slide, ride it out. Right? How high, how good can you feel? How high can you jump on this thing? It's, it's an, it's like a form of athleticism almost. Yeah. So yeah, shorten the goalposts too. Even the only goal should be to enjoy the next— this breath. So yeah, if you have some goal way off in the distance to enter into some Jhanas or have some experiences or whatever, that's missing the point of the practice, is to simply be satisfied with this one right here. And then the next one. That's why I like at the end of the call, sometimes someone says have a good day to Dhammarato and he says have a good moment. Right? Yeah. What the fuck is a good day? Like, You're only going to have a good moment or a bad moment. So make your choice about how this moment is going to be.

**Speaker E:** What if the thought is still lingering like the Dukkha? Like it feels like this whole talk I've been just doing the breathing and feeling great. But there's still like 5% of Dukkha doubt. This can't be real. I'm not allowing it.

**Speaker B:** Right. What's that? Don't pull on that thread. So there's that little bit of Dukkha there. Just don't go in that direction. Just keep up with the wholesome thoughts. Don't pull on that thread. So it's like a thread. So it's like you have a blanket or a coat and there's like a thread coming off of it. And that's the little bit of Dukkha. And if you pull on it, it's going to unravel the whole thing, right?

**Speaker E:** So I can just let it drop away.

**Speaker B:** Let it drop away and just keep applying a sustained wholesome thought. Don't go down the— like, I don't know if you've ever went on Reddit and you're browsing the comment section and there's an unwholesome thread. Don't open the thread and go down the million lines of unwholesome thoughts. When you go down that way, does that make sense? You just keep scrolling past it. So you keep applying sustaining thought. So it's the little bit of dissatisfaction, the little bit of Dukkha that's there. It's not really of interest to us. What's of interest is how good this breath is right now, in this moment.

**Speaker E:** So was this little rest Dukkha? It's okay that it's there. You just kind of ignore it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, pretty much.

**Speaker D:** Another thing that I would like to add too is that it might not be that it is always there too, right? This is very much like impermanence. It's there for a little bit when we become aware of it, but then it just kind of slips away, right? So there might be this idea that there's this constant string of Dukkha, but really, it's not there. It's just there when it arises, and then it ceases. But when it arises, we think, oh wow, it's been here this whole time, and then the idea of time comes up and all this jazz. But when we see it like just now, it's like— and we pop it off right now. That's not an issue. Also.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I'll say, um, Wait, let me get the English in my mind. Yeah, I kind of, I get that totally like conceptualized, but experiencing it actually still creates doubt, because it's kind of like, I can't say that I see this, you know what I mean?

**Speaker B:** That's why I'm not saying do any of the complicated things like notice impermanence of whatever. Just apply the sustain the wholesome thoughts. Okay, this is what I did. And it works. And after the fact, when you're already in Jhana, then you can, you can really be aware of certain characteristics of reality. But trying to artificially take yourself out of Dukkha by looking for the prescribed characteristics of reality doesn't work. But what does work is putting a smile on your face and taking satisfying breaths. And stop thinking. Stop thinking about the stuff that makes you unhappy. Just be stupid. Just be a stupid idiot. You don't need to know anything about the Dharma. You don't need to be an expert.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I don't think it's that complicated though. It's like literally just noticing, okay, when we throw in like a thought of like, oh, congratulations, like that was spotted, don't have to step in that. Noticing that there is already change, like impermanence isn't complicated, it's immediate. It's like not conceptual at all when you directly are looking at it. Like it's just that's what it is, right? But it can be like just seeing like, oh, okay, congratulations, it's already, it's already changed. Like that's already changed. We're already, you know, changing. This is already it.

**Speaker B:** You know? Yeah. So doing the apply, sustain, wholesome is just a demonstration of impermanence.

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** But you, um, so the ability to change the mind and then the feelings is the realization of impermanence by doing, by doing it. Realize impermanence experientially. By changing how you feel.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, we're not waiting for change like that kind of change to come on high. Like we're not waiting for it to be hit by, you know, the Kamma machine, you know, in that sort of way that, oh, well, we'll be blessed by that. It's like, no, actually just apply the right effort. We practice the mindfulness, the Sati, remembering, the looking, that again discerning, is this wholesome, is this unwholesome? Very, you know, easy peasy. And then just applying that effort, apply and sustain, run that around in circles. Bada bing, bada boom, there's confidence. We've seen this so many times, so many times that there isn't like, there isn't, there isn't a shred of doubt. It's just like, okay, we see it. This is how it is, right? And then the mind's unified. It ain't fighting. It's just, hey, we can just chill out.

**Speaker E:** Okay, so So maybe the practice is more like— so the practice isn't to like not let Dukkha thoughts come up, but more like just dodging by seeing.

**Speaker B:** Make wholesome thoughts. So don't worry about the Dukkha thoughts, just make wholesome thoughts. Make your own wholesome thoughts. Apply and sustain.

**Speaker E:** Talk about a wholesome thought. Could, can be like, oh nice, I was able to dodge that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, definitely. Um, yeah, the, the, a big misconception is the idea that something is magically going to change without you changing it. So nobody's coming to save you. You got to save yourself, sadly enough. There's no cosmic Shaktipat coming to magically give you grace from Dukkha. There's nothing I can do to save you. You have to do it yourself. I did it for myself, and I can tell you how to do it, but you have to be the one to do it. And it turns out it's really fun when everyone's doing it at the same time, because we can all just sit here and smile and shoot the shit with each other and just appreciate that friendship and the power of any group, any amount of people gathering together and just appreciating the moment, this moment together, and not worrying about anything else.

**Speaker E:** So if you think about it, aren't all concepts that you make in your mind are dukkhas, then? Because they most of the time make you think about past or future and take you out of present.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I would say Concepts aren't necessarily bad, but I'm just going to say yes to that, Marcel, because I don't want you to be thinking about anything right now. So just drop your concepts. That's one way to get rid of wholesome thoughts. That's one way to get rid of unwholesome thoughts. You can shove them out by thinking wholesome thoughts, wholesome thoughts, wholesome thoughts. But you can also stop thinking altogether. Stop conceptualizing things. That's why I said be just a stupid idiot with a grin on your face. There's no need to think about things right now. There's nothing you need to do. There's no danger in your immediate environment. What's the problem? That's what I'm saying. What's the problem? There's no problem. It's all good.

**Speaker E:** What about body stuff? Like, I don't know, for example, I've been trying to get my neck in a good position lying down for like 50 minutes now, and it's still annoying me.

**Speaker B:** Well, I don't know, try doing like— try rolling your neck around. Just like let it— let your neck stretch like this. There's some tension on this side. Just let it hang for a little bit. And just feel the stretch. And if there's some tension in the back, let it hang forward. Even do some of this a little bit, just really gently. Take some deep breaths.

**Speaker C:** And the body is going to die, and you might die after your next breath. So you're going to have to let that go too.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the body's gonna die. But we can experience a relaxed and happy body right now. I don't see any immediate threats. But an asteroid could come through the atmosphere and strike us here. So that's all the more reason not to worry about anything, right? As Aaron pointed out there. Yeah, it's, you know, I'm here for a good time, not a long time. Okay. We're going to die. Everything you think that matters doesn't really matter that much in the grand scheme of things. I know you've heard that all before.

**Speaker C:** And you don't even get to own the good time. You know, it's like What can you take with you? Do you have a skill that will survive through the portal of wherever the change leads?

**Speaker B:** If you have a good time right now, that's enough. So you're never going to have a good time in the past or the future. And Having a good time right now doesn't mean you need to own having a good time, because here it is, right? If you're not having a good time and you're thinking about the good time in the past that you owned, and now that's causing you Dukkha, right? So you can only try to own a good time in the past.

**Speaker C:** The Buddha said that. He said in the good time, there's only the good time.

**Speaker B:** Right. It just, it is what it is. In the good time, it's just a good time. There's no person having a good time. It's just a good time. It's so simple. There's nothing to worry about. There's nothing to cling to.

**Speaker E:** Would you say that tension in the body is an indicator for Dukkha or Dukkha you missed? In the sense of like right now I feel totally relaxed and once I stop paying attention like for 10 seconds I'll notice, I don't know, my leg getting more tense.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so tension in the body is Dukkha. It doesn't— if you're experiencing tension in the body, you're dissatisfied. So if there's tension in the body, the right effort is to take a deep breath and relax the tension. The body and the mind are one system. A happy body is a happy mind and vice versa.

**Speaker E:** What if it doesn't work?

**Speaker B:** Well, that's— you have to do it. So what if it doesn't work, right? That's in the future. You just do it, okay? It's like you can worry about whether it's gonna work or not. Like for the rest of your life and not do it. I recommend doing it. So I can, like when I go snowboarding, I could say, oh, what if I can't do the jump? I just do it. I don't know what else to tell you, dude. Like that's the same way meditation works. I mean, you learn by doing. You might fall down, you may not do it, but it doesn't mean you don't stop doing it. Okay, forget about that one. Just never mind, start again. Let me give another shot. Every moment is a new moment. Every breath is a new breath that can be enjoyed.

**Speaker C:** Um, I mean, but at no point while you're alive is there going to be no tension in your body, you know?

**Speaker B:** That's not true at all. You can experience a tension-free body, a.

**Speaker C:** Totally sit up straight and not have tension. That's what your muscles do to keep you upright. Like, it's a literal physical force keeping you from just flopping over, you know what I mean?

**Speaker B:** Well, um, you can— your muscle can— your muscles can still be working without, without being tense.

**Speaker C:** Like, well, I guess tripping over the word tense, like, if I pull a rope tight, there's tension there, right?

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker C:** And that's what would hold up a stick, would be if I have a leaning stick, right, and gravity is trying to pull it down, but I have a string on the top of it and that string is pulled tight by the gravity of the stick, it's tense, and that's what's holding the stick up. If you add a bunch of rope suddenly to, to that distance, the stick's just going to fall because there's no tension. From the end of the stick to whatever's holding the other end of the rope. So I mean, it's— there's no need for more tension than what's holding the stick up, right? The added tension would not be necessary. Wouldn't be necessary to have a really heavy stick and then a super strong metal cable, right? Your stick is what it is. It only requires as much tension as it needs to be in the angle it's in.

**Speaker E:** In.

**Speaker C:** So you don't need to like press on it more and, and say, why is there so much tension here? And like try to get rid of the fact that you have a stick under tension. The body is a living thing. It's like you don't control every single cell inside it, right? It's like you don't like the tension. You don't like this realm of things you can't control and you're tripping over, that's where you're upset. You're upset that I'm supposed to be able to fix every problem that I'm perceiving in my body. But I mean, good luck with that. How about just fix not being a— having an attitude where it's like, these problems are mine and I'm going to be the one who solves them for me.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, oh yeah, I don't know if.

**Speaker C:** That lands, but so if you guys.

**Speaker B:** Are interested in experiencing Jhana, you have to get rid of the tensions in your body. There's no other way. In the suttas, it says directly in the Anapanasati Sutta, as I breathe in long, I know that I breathe in long. As I breathe in, I relax the bodily tensions. In the suttas it says it's directly translated to tranquilize bodily formations, tranquilize bodily formations. But really what that means is you relax the tensions in your body.

**Speaker C:** But what I'm saying is like, if you were sitting there in any posture other than lying flat on the ground and someone came up with a tranquilizer you would see what tension you had in your body, whether you were in Jhana or not. Like, you would fall, gravity would take you and go, and all the tension would be gone. Because it's tension that holds you erect.

**Speaker B:** I'm not talking about the concept of your body. I'm talking about the direct experience of your body. And in Jhana, in the direct experience of And your body is not actually a permanent thing either. It's just changing sensations. So I'm only experiencing the current sensation of my body. And it is possible in your direct experience to not be experiencing any bodily tension whatsoever.

**Speaker C:** In fact, it's— but your experience is not the body. The body is there, and therefore you can have an experience.

**Speaker B:** So So, Arin, this is a good, this is a really good point.

**Speaker C:** If you didn't have a body, you would not be having an experience of no tension.

**Speaker B:** So you have your direct experience of the body, and then you have the concept of what the body is. And in meditation, we're not interested in our concept about the body, we're interested in the direct experience of it. So the direct experience of whether or not there's Dukkha or not. I don't care conceptually.

**Speaker C:** But the word tension is like a physical thing, right? Which I mean, are you denying the existence of causes and conditions that create the physical realm? Like there are causes and conditions, no?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Whether we experience them or not, they're there. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** I mean, you could call that a.

**Speaker C:** Concept, but it's— We know it's true, right? It's our knowledge.

**Speaker B:** But the only causes and conditions the Dhamma really cares about is the causes and conditions of dukkha and the cessation of dukkha, right? The Buddha said time and time again, I teach one thing and one alone, dukkha, Nirodha.

**Speaker C:** But Vedana was talking about the body, right? Does the body have to go away for Dukkha to go away?

**Speaker B:** I'm not trying to get in an argument with your ontological presuppositions about reality.

**Speaker C:** But the fact that the body exists is a presupposition about reality.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's a presumption, actually. You don't know it exists apart from the direct experience.

**Speaker C:** But why don't we address Vedana's presumption about the tension in his body?

**Speaker B:** The tension is the tension. So it's not a presumption. Where you're either—.

**Speaker A:** It'S just experience.

**Speaker B:** You're either experiencing tension or you're not.

**Speaker C:** Okay, so we're talking about the tension in his experience, not in his neck.

**Speaker B:** So you can have a tension that we call neck tension that is really just a sensation, right? It's a sensation that we've categorized as neck tension, but that sensation is not satisfying sensation. It's a Dukkha sensation.

**Speaker C:** But it's the not satisfyingness that makes it Dukkha. It's not the tension, because like I said, you can experience the tension in anything. I can grip a baseball and experience that tension. That's an experience of tension.

**Speaker A:** Right?

**Speaker E:** So the difference is the judgment, right? So there's tension, but if I experience this as unsatisfying, it's tension. If I experience this as satisfying, it's just a bodily sensation.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** So labeling attention and not wanting it. Sensation that exists obviously in this world, my body.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so if your body is uncomfortable, the right effort is to relax your body. Now, if you would like to sit and be uncomfortable and have a tense body, by all means be my guest. And whatever justification you have for it, nobody's stopping you. But I have a recommendation for a different way to meditate. To actually relax the bodily tensions in your body so that you can experience a more clear state of mind, undistracted and unagitated. Yes, DJ, you're going to say something?

**Speaker D:** Oh yeah, no, so this is quite useful though, discussion just talking about, again, delving into the tension and what we mean by that. But also I would like to say like Really, yeah, it's sort of like, again, putting in the right effort to relax the tension is very helpful to take those breaths, to breathe into the sensation and just, yeah. But I think what is really helpful too is to, again, when that sensation, when that arises, right, is also to not be averse to it when it comes up, because that will just perhaps cause the tension to clench even more, if you will, like to really go into that, right, to become averse, because again, disliking, there can be the disliking of the tension, like maybe the tension you could almost say, oh, this is an unpleasant sensation, right? But then if that becomes aversion, then we start to get the attachment and all that stuff, and then Dukkha gets born, right? But again, if we can— again, putting in the effort to relax the tension is very helpful, right? And it's a lot easier to do if you have the confidence of like, oh, okay, cool, that's just the a little sensation here, and we can just breathe into that, and oh, it's so nice, and enjoy the process. Because if we have conceptualized too some kind of perfect, far-out-there supreme relaxation, right, and that's not here, and we're like craving after that, guess what? Dukkha's back, baby, because it's born through the craving, through the lusting after it, lusting for experience to be different. But again, we can still put in the effort to change, to make it so, yeah, it is more pleasant, it is relaxing. We can really relax the body. And so again, it's kind of that nice little balance there, right?

**Speaker B:** That's a good point.

**Speaker C:** So there's a limit to that, right? There's a limit to how much, you know, if somebody's injecting you with testosterone and, and, you know, like, whatever, that's going to like turn you into some like walking zombie where you can't control your limbs. There's only so much you can do about that, right?

**Speaker B:** You might be a little bit more aggressive, a little bit more horny, but I don't know if testosterone turns you into a zombie per se.

**Speaker D:** But yeah, yeah, no, but actually do the opposite.

**Speaker C:** I picked the wrong chemical.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. But the point I was going to make is When your mind is happy, your body is happy, whether you realize it or not. So when you're talking yourself into a wholesome state is the same as relaxing bodily tensions. So you can attack from either angle. If relaxing— so yeah, don't get stuck to one method. If relaxing the bodily tension doesn't resonate, and you find yourself fighting with your body, and it makes the tension worse, Well, then just, yeah, you can just think, okay, I'm totally fine with that tension. I can be happy anyways. And so you talk yourself into a satisfied state. And talking yourself into a satisfied state and thinking wholesome thoughts, before you know it, just like a headache, you don't even notice when it's gone. The tension is gone. It's completely gone in your body.

**Speaker E:** This idea really creates craving for me because every time I sit down to meditate, I have like really cramping in my face, like noticeably. I can, if I film myself, I see my nose twitching.

**Speaker A:** And.

**Speaker E:** That would mean I was never able to get into a good satisfied state during meditation, but I believe I did.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I have a question. Do you spend a lot of time interacting with people's faces and like having to perform for them?

**Speaker E:** No, I'm like IT and sitting in front of my computer and not having to interact with anyone in my life.

**Speaker C:** That's interesting.

**Speaker B:** Well, so, um, geez, I lost my train of thought. Yeah, so the facial tension comes from the mental tension. And oh, yes, Marcel, thinking about a past meditation that wasn't going good is what we're trying to get rid of here. So instead of thinking about whether you did the meditation correctly, or whether you're going to do the meditation, try it. Just try it. Do it with us right now. Try to relax. Try to think wholesome thoughts right now. Don't think about the problems that's come up before, or the problems that might come up, because those can never be solved. The only solution is actually doing it in this moment. But yeah, you can get creative. Sometimes I have some tension in my face, just scrub it out a little bit. You know, like, it's not like you have to be stuck to one formula of how to get into a wholesome state or one method or one thing. Oh God, I think the thoughts I got to do the breathing, or I got to do it. The point, the result is better than the technique. So.

**Speaker C:** And there's causes for the tension, right? There, it may be what you do, it may be something that you don't have control over, you know, whether you can discern what's causing it or not. What you can do is pay attention to it and see if there's thoughts associated with it, or you can see if it's driving you. Like you said, it's making your meditation difficult. If it's making your meditation difficult, maybe that's part of the meditation that you need, is to figure out whether or not that's a problem? Like, what is it about it that it's a problem? Is it because you think you're supposed to have ultimate power over the facial muscles? Is that the problem? Like, why you don't like— The problem.

**Speaker E:** Is like, like, that it makes me believe that that meditation, that the path, which I believe is like the right way to do, is kind of difficult to get or whatever, or to do in the moment because of this facial shit going on. And that the Dukkha creates the sensation.

**Speaker C:** Maybe the meditation isn't something that, you know, takes one of the aggregates and like melts it into like candle wax, you know, maybe the meditation is something that says, you know what, fuck this facial twitching shit, I'm fine. What's, you know, what's my big toe doing? I don't care.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you can just go somewhere else. Like, like you can, if something's bothering you, a thought, a sensation, you just think about something else. You just, yeah, what is my big toe doing? You weren't paying attention to your big toe, right? Also practice smiling, okay? Just a slight smile. Not a lot, just a little. Just a smooth drip. It's like a drip, like a drip of morphine, just one drip after another, just smooth drip it.

**Speaker E:** And thinking about it, like the last hour you talked, it wasn't even always there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, of course it wasn't. It's only there when you're thinking about it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, man. What you guys are talking about right now is actually reminds me of a sutta called the Relaxation of Thoughts sutta, where the Buddha lists 5 ways you can relax distracting thoughts. It's exactly what you're saying right now. You can either pay attention to something else, or you can just think a wholesome thought instead of it, or you can relax the bodily fabrication associated to the thought. Or you can even crush mind with mind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** The fifth way. Like a last resort. When you have no other last resort.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** It's actually the same thing you guys are talking about right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** It's the clenching of the teeth, right?

**Speaker A:** And putting the tongue against the root of the mouth. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** I asked Dhammarato about that one and he said Like, it came up that like, yeah, that's for like really dangerous thoughts that you really need to get rid of, right? Thoughts of harming yourself or other people, or you're just, you're going full time at this thing and you become absolutely determined and nothing's working. Last resort type of thing. But, you know, I wouldn't recommend doing that method off the bat. But yeah, if that's what stops you from thinking about killing someone or something terrible or something like that, then by all means do it. But I think that's a good note to end it on. If anyone has any other thing that they want to pop in. Any closing remarks, please? DJ, this is it. This is it. And Lurie, is that how you say your name?

**Speaker A:** It's Iudi. It's an I.

**Speaker B:** Ah, interesting. Okay, it was good to see you.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. I'd like to say thank you. Thank you guys for the exchanges and your time and valuable thoughts. Thank you very much.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, thank you guys for showing up. Really appreciate it. And it's really good to see you, Aryan, as well. Marcel, thanks all. Bye. Hi, bye-bye everyone.

**Speaker C:** Hi guys.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, the core teaching is about **accessing a state of freedom from suffering (Dukkha) here and now through simple, direct effort**, rather than striving for distant spiritual goals. Here is a summary of the key points:

**Main Theme:** **Nibbana (enlightenment/freedom) is not a future attainment but a present-moment possibility accessible to anyone.** The shift in the speaker's (Speaker B/Scott's) demeanor noticed by others came from applying this.

**Core Practice & Instructions:**

1.  **Be Satisfied Now:** The fundamental "trick" is to **stop wanting anything to be different** and find total satisfaction with the present moment—even with something as simple as being on a call. Happiness doesn't require any external conditions.
2.  **Use "Right Effort" - Apply & Sustain Wholesome Thoughts:** Actively talk yourself into a happy, wholesome state. When an unwholesome or stressful thought arises, don't fight it; instead, **"apply and sustain" a positive thought** to sidestep it. Build a momentum of good feeling.
3.  **Relax the Body:** As in the Anapanasati Sutta, breathe to **relax bodily tensions**. A calm body supports a calm mind. This isn't about achieving a perfect, tension-free body conceptually, but about easing the *direct experience* of discomfort.
4.  **Be Present & Hyper-Aware:** Meditation is **hyper-awareness of immediate sensory experience** (sights, sounds, bodily sensations, thoughts) without getting lost in past/future conceptualization. The speaker uses the analogy of a skilled hunter aware of every twig snap in the forest.
5.  **Let Go of "Personality View":** The idea of a fixed, continuous self is an illusion (the first fetter). Your thoughts and feelings change constantly. Don't identify with them.

**Important Clarifications & Warnings:**

*   **No Magic, No Savior:** The change is not a magical event. It's a skill built through practice. **You must do it yourself;** no one can do it for you.
*   **Don't Get Lost in Concepts:** Techniques (like the 6Rs) or complex doctrines can become baggage. The practice is simpler than that: **breathe, relax, be happy now.**
*   **Jhana is a Byproduct, Not a Goal:** Jhana (meditative absorption) is the natural result of this relaxation and gladdening of the mind, characterized by **the absence of restlessness**. Don't strive for it as a future achievement.
*   **Distinction from Advaita/Non-Duality:** While similar, the speaker notes that systems like Advaita often posit a permanent, true Self. The Dhamma path here emphasizes **impermanence and not-clinging** to *any* state, even boundless or blissful ones.

**Practical Advice from the Q&A:**

*   **On Distracting Thoughts/Sensations:** Don't pull on the thread. Gently redirect attention (e.g., from a tense neck to the big toe) and maintain wholesome thoughts. The "five ways to relax thoughts" from the suttas are referenced.
*   **On Bodily Tension:** It is an indicator of Dukkha. The effort is to relax it, but if fighting it makes it worse, **change your attitude:** be happy *despite* the sensation. A happy mind will often relax the body naturally.
*   **On Doubt:** If there's a lingering 5% doubt ("this can't be real"), **don't engage with it.** Keep applying the wholesome thoughts. Confidence comes from repeated direct experience.
*   **The Attitude:** **"Be a stupid idiot with a grin on your face."** Stop overthinking. There is no immediate danger. Just be present and satisfied.

**Conclusion:** The path is about **letting go, not gaining.** By purifying the mind through present-moment satisfaction, relaxing the body, and abandoning the craving for things to be different, one can experience freedom from suffering immediately. The group call itself is a practice session where everyone can "talk themselves" into this wholesome, unified state together.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, Speaker B (the main teacher) uses several **metaphors, analogies, and stories** to explain meditation, Jhana, and the path to satisfaction. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Metaphors & Analogies:**

1. **The Skilled Hunter in the Forest**  
   - **Usage:** To describe heightened, non-conceptual awareness in meditation.  
   - **Explanation:** Like a hunter attuned to every sound and movement in the forest, a meditator becomes hyper-aware of immediate sensory phenomena (breath, sounds, bodily sensations) without getting lost in thought.

2. **The Hamster Wheel of Samsara / Being a Clown for Mara’s Entertainment**  
   - **Usage:** To describe the cyclical, unsatisfying nature of unawakened life.  
   - **Explanation:** Mara (the personification of distraction/temptation) is entertained by people chasing desires and creating their own suffering. Awakening is “taking off the costume” and stopping the performance.

3. **Pushing a Car to Start It (Stick Shift)**  
   - **Usage:** To illustrate the effort needed to enter Jhana.  
   - **Explanation:** Initially, you must push the car (apply wholesome thoughts/effort) until it gains enough momentum to start on its own. Once the “engine” of joy is running, you can “ride” it.

4. **The Unraveling Thread**  
   - **Usage:** To warn against engaging with small bits of residual dissatisfaction (dukkha).  
   - **Explanation:** Pulling a loose thread on a garment can unravel the whole thing. Similarly, focusing on a minor negative thought or sensation can undo your meditative peace.

5. **The Paper Airplane**  
   - **Usage:** To explain the relationship between initial effort and effortless flow.  
   - **Explanation:** You fold the plane (apply right effort), but once it’s flying, you don’t keep folding it—it glides on its own. Similarly, meditation becomes self-sustaining after correct initial effort.

6. **The Centipede Story** (referenced secondhand from Dhammarato)  
   - **Usage:** To describe how right effort is intuitive, not a mechanical checklist.  
   - **Explanation:** When asked how it coordinates its many legs, the centipede doesn’t know—it just walks. Likewise, right effort becomes natural through practice, not over-analysis.

7. **A Drip of Morphine**  
   - **Usage:** To describe the gentle, cumulative effect of cultivating wholesome states.  
   - **Explanation:** A smooth, consistent drip of medication brings relief. Similarly, a slight, sustained smile and wholesome thoughts gradually build satisfaction.

8. **The Avalanche of Good Feelings**  
   - **Usage:** To describe the self-reinforcing nature of joy in meditation.  
   - **Explanation:** Once wholesome thoughts gain momentum, they create an “avalanche” of positive feeling that you can “slide” on effortlessly.

### **Stories & Personal Anecdotes:**

1. **Speaker B’s Own Transformation**  
   - **Story:** He describes being “full of sorrow, lamentation, as per usual” while walking in a park, then applying Dhammarato’s advice to “talk himself into feeling happy.” This created a feedback loop of empowerment and liberation, leading to a lasting shift.

2. **The “Emperor of the Universe” Realization**  
   - **Story:** Upon discovering he could be happy with nothing, he felt like the “Emperor of the Universe”—having what everyone seeks (inner satisfaction) which no external power can take away.

3. **Advaita vs. Dhamma Comparison**  
   - **Story:** Speaker B shares his prior practice of Advaita (non-duality), which he says can lead to boundless Jhana but mistakes it for enlightenment because it still posits a permanent, underlying self. This is contrasted with the Buddha’s teaching of non-self and the cessation of dukkha.

### **Key Conceptual Metaphors:**

- **Nirvana is Samsara:** Enlightenment isn’t a future destination; it’s being awake to the present moment, free from craving.
- **Meditation as “Being a Stupid Idiot”:** Letting go of complex concepts and simply being present with a smile.
- **Owning vs. Not-Owning:** Awakening involves not claiming ownership of thoughts, feelings, or sensations—seeing them as impermanent and not-self.
- **The Body as a Forest:** The totality of your sensory experience (sights, sounds, bodily feelings) is the “forest” you attentively inhabit.

These metaphors and stories collectively emphasize **simplicity, direct experience, self-empowerment, and the immediacy of peace** available through letting go of craving and conceptual thinking.
