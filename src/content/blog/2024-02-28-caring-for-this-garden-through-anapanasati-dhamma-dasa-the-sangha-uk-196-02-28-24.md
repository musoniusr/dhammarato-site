### Transcript


**Speaker A:** But you never know. So it says it's recording. Do you see a little recording light on top there? Does it say it's recording? I think it is, it always does.

**Speaker B:** All right, yeah, yeah, I see it now. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Oh, great.

**Speaker B:** Good.

**Speaker A:** So, Carl, I guess I'll start off with Do you have any questions at all? Because usually I just, if nobody's talking, I'll just kind of go into a little Dhamma spiel.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, actually I have a— I'm just, you know, I'm kind of new to this particular kind of teaching. So I'm more— I have plenty of questions. I just— my first time pulling the Sangha up, so didn't really know what to expect. But I guess there will be questions as we go along, you know. What do you think?

**Speaker A:** Oh, I'm sorry, somebody tried calling me as you were speaking, so I didn't hear what you said. Can you repeat please what you just said?

**Speaker B:** No, no, I said it's my first time I'm calling to the Sangha, so I'm not really sure what to expect. So I don't have any particular question right now, but I'm sure it will pop up if you take the Dhamma lead.

**Speaker A:** Sure. So I guess we'll start with some basics because in my opinion the basics are where it's all at. Because I tell a lot of people, a lot of friends, that the Buddha was interested really And really only one thing: Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Those are words from the— I mean.

**Speaker B:** I know Dukkha, but Nirodha?

**Speaker A:** Dukkha means— you probably know Dukkha, but.

**Speaker B:** I don't know Dukkha, Nirodha.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Dukkha means suffering, but a better translation, like Dhammarato always talks about, is Dissatisfaction. Yeah. And Nirodha means the cessation.

**Speaker B:** Aha. All right.

**Speaker A:** The ability, the ability to change that Dukkha from dissatisfaction into satisfaction. And that's the only thing the group is interested in.

**Speaker B:** I teach sorrow and the end of sorrow.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Yeah. Yeah, I teach dissatisfaction, the end of dissatisfaction.

**Speaker B:** Ah, got it. So I always wondered what Narada meant. So it's cessation then?

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, cessation, a kind of dissolving or changing or getting rid of, ceasing to be. There is Dukkha, and there's also the possibility to get rid of it, not only for ourselves but for helping others get rid of it. They'll get rid of it themselves ultimately, but we can always help them get rid of it. And So he, the Buddha, went through a lot of stuff. His body— he left his family, his body became emaciated, he spent time with ascetics in the forest. He did a whole bunch of work for us that we don't have to do, and it doesn't mean that we don't— especially for beginners, solitude is great. I'm a big proponent of solitude, so is the Buddha. So you don't have to go crazy with it, but it's good for a lot of people getting interested in it. Spend some time alone, observe the body, observe the breath, observe the mind, observe what things come and go, how they come and go. Observe it and do a little bit of self-investigation is always good. And the more time we do that, the more time we'll be learning about how our mind works, how our body works in relation to not only our thoughts, feelings, emotions, but also how it works in relation to our actions, how certain actions can affect the thought, feelings, and emotions, how certain thought, feelings, and emotions, if we give them attention, can also affect things in the physical reality as well. But if we do this, if we spend some time alone, we'll discover that if we look at the mind— the mind, I tell people, is always like this: happy, sad, medium, medium, bored, happy, sad, bored, bored, feeling okay, feeling happy, sad. For most people, that's what our thoughts, feelings, emotions are like, to sum it up in an extremely simple way. We could get— What's that?

**Speaker B:** A lot of Dukkha there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, a lot of Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** You know, bored, sad, stressed.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and that's generally speaking for people. For most people, it's like anger, hatred, delusion, anger, hatred, delusion, maybe a glimpse of some sensory pleasure, anger, hatred, delusion. Maybe a little bit of fear of not knowing what it is.

**Speaker B:** And that kind of instability itself becomes a kind of a, you know, even if you have a glimpse of a good, stable, nice moment, you know, you just remember that I was irritated and, you know, I'm stressed about missing the, you know, whatever. So, you know, you look at yourself as a wiggling worm, you know.

**Speaker A:** Yes, due to Sankhara's bad habits. It's kind of like our Kamma too, our bad habits. Our bad habits lead to bad fruits, to bad ends, and our good habits lead to good fruits and good ends. And each moment is a mind moment, just like we were talking about. See, and I like moving my hands in particular ways. One, because it feels good. And the other because I'm a visual learner. So you're going to see my hands move a lot, and I'm only mentioning this because I know Dhammarato has talked about this, but it's not that I'm unaware of my hands. I'm doing it when I say delusion and I go like this. It helps me, and my son has autism, so I'm always naturally kind of pointing to things and helping him because he's nonverbal communicate. So that's a little Okay, a little PSA I got out there for myself and others.

**Speaker B:** Who don't understand. Okay, well, I do that too, so— right, but is it a bad habit?

**Speaker A:** No, it's wonderful. But when Dhammarato mentions that, and I'm not going to speak for Dhammarato, but he can tell me if I'm right or wrong, but— or you rather, or me, whatever. But he mentions these things because a lot of times we're not aware of what we're doing in the moment, right here, right now. And when he says things like that, I take from it— I could be wrong, but this is just my opinion— I take from it what the teacher is saying is— and he doesn't like to be called a teacher, but that's another thing. I don't mind, I like calling him a teacher, but that's just me. But he prefers wise friend. I respect and agree with that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no, but I noticed he doesn't like to be called a teacher, but.

**Speaker A:** Then again— Yes, it's because he's awesome.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, yes, he's humble because he's humble. But then again, in other points, he's saying that he's teaching the Dhamma, so that makes him a teacher. That was his call by his Yeah.

**Speaker A:** You have to walk a fine line sometimes when you— when there's so many people listening to you speak. Whether you can call yourself a teacher, a master, a nobody, a pile of dirt, but at the end of the day, the points he gets across are amazing with whatever he's teaching. Like he says, you know, I'm just a wise friend. And that's wonderful. But he's— in my opinion, he's— I can't speak for him. Again, you'd have to ask him, which he's readily available. But I get from that, it's like, it's like, hey guys, let's stay on track, you know? Let's, let's, uh, keep in mind that I'm— he likes to be called a human, he says sometimes. Like, he's very down to earth, he's very non-magical. And this is what he helps to convey to us through his words. He tries to convey to us the Dhamma, reality. And these words like master this, and when he says talking with the hands, you see a lot of people on video, and I'm guilty of it in the past myself, you get scratchy, you get like this, you know, and it comes from not being satisfied. It comes from not being, not not remembering to look at the breath or our body in the moment. So there's a lot of good things that can come from him reminding us to be present, to be the masters of our body, not have our bodies be the master of us. So if we move, I would recommend moving intentionally. If we're speaking, Choosing our words wisely. And that's interesting, that's interesting that you pointed that out because I was thinking about that. There are these rules that humans are used to as we grow up, especially in school, our educational system, particularly in the West. Do this, don't do that, sit in your chair, better get a good grade for this, better get a good grade for that, listen to the teacher, sit quietly. And all the child wants to do is run around like a chicken in the garden. He doesn't want to sit in a chair, you know what I mean?

**Speaker B:** Of course, the system is really crazy.

**Speaker A:** Yes, and also with religion in the West, we're used to that. We're used— what I'm basically saying is we're used to being told what to do like dumb animals. Yeah, used to say, you sit there, you sit down, you shut up, and you do this and this and this. That's what we're used to. And we carry it over into certain philosophies, religions, practices, even sports. Whatever we get into, we carry these bad habits usually with us. But in Buddhism, there's guidelines. There's not these harsh rules. Sure, if you take a vow as a monk, as a monastic, to live the monastic lifestyle in Thailand or Japan or China or wherever, Sure, you're telling them that you have an objective and an honorable objective and you're going to fulfill it. There's no problem with that. That's different. That actually might be closer to rules instead of God. But for what they call the layman, yeah, there's— and both for the layman and monk as well— there's precepts. There are certain guidelines, but a lot of beginners with Buddhism, because of our Samskara, because of society's brainwashing, we're very good at sitting still and being told what to do. So it's no different in Buddhism. When we get into Buddhism, at first we might read a book, we might hear of some of some precepts. We might have a teacher, we might have a wise friend, we might have a master who tell us certain things to help us. The Pali Canon is filled with beautiful things to help us, but because we still have a lot of the Sankharas from the Western mindset, we take these to be gospel and don't— we don't yet haven't developed the wisdom, the natural wisdom that's hiding, I always say. But we haven't quite cleared off our glasses enough of ignorance, Avidya, to see clearly. For example of what I'm talking about, there's an old Zen story about a particular master who is walking along a river with his student, and for whatever reason, the temple or wat or whatever they call it, or whatever they call it in Japan. Temple, sure. They have a rule that the master especially and the aspiring monks are not to touch women. Your hand is not to touch the flesh of a woman. I don't know if that's commonplace in Buddhism, I don't care, but in this story that was their kind of guideline rule. In their temple that was taken very seriously. So they're walking along a river, and the master and the student, they hear screaming, and they hear a drowning woman who's fallen into the river trying to cross it to deliver fish to her family. She's fallen in and she's screaming bloody murder. She doesn't know how to swim very well. It's a very powerful river. Rivers are dangerous. So the student, he looks in shock, sitting there like a dumb animal with his mouth open. And the master takes his robe off, dives into the river, thereby saving the woman, bringing her to shore. She's thanking him appropriately. He says, no problem. And the woman goes off happy that the master saved her. So they're walking for a few more miles with the student. He puts his robe back on. They're walking, and the student looks at the master. He says, master, you've broken one of the most sacred rules at our temple. How can I even call you my master? Your hands were all over that woman. I even saw your hand kind of skim over her breast. What's wrong with you, Master? And the Master just sits there quietly and says, he says, you know, don't fall in love with the finger pointing at the moon because you're going to miss all that beautiful glory. You're going to miss all the fruit of the moon. He's gonna see— he says, you know, we have these guidelines, so it's meant so you can use your brain, so you can use your heart. He's like, according to you, if I'm following the rules of your Dharma practice, so-called practice, I'm to let a dying woman drown when I have the complete ability and ease to save her? You're saying if I'm a good Dhamma master, I should let her die? He says, you see, this is why the Zen masters smack their students sometimes in the face for these stupid ways of thinking. He says these guidelines are put in place so the monks are not running around thinking of sex all day, going after women, getting women pregnant, getting involved in things that aren't in line with our little temple here. Like, it's meant to get you away from the chasing, grasping mind at the temporary sense pleasures of the world. It's not meant to to put in place so a drowning woman fucking dies, moron. So this is why I tell people, God gave us a brain, we have to use it. There are all kinds of precepts, all kinds of guidelines, all kinds of things that people often mistakenly look at as rules, but there are no rules in Buddhism. There's guidelines meant to help us turn our Dukkha into Sukkha, help us change our dissatisfaction into satisfaction. Of course, if somebody is in bodily harm, you must save them. And I like saying this as an example because it shows people, yes, study the Pali Canon, yes, listen to your master teaching or wise friend, whatever it may be. Don't forget to use your brain. God gave you a brain, you know. You don't want to work like the dumb animal working all day listening to bosses, and you also don't want to follow people's rules like a dumb animal. Well, I can't save this woman because I was told not to touch women. Use your head. You're not gonna let these things take over you. You're not The Dhamma and Dharma practice is wonderful, and these guidelines are a wonderful tool. But just like any tool— fire, for instance— fire can be used to keep you warm at night or to burn down somebody's house. Use it wisely. Don't fall in love with the finger pointing to the moon. The finger's guiding you, you know? So look out, don't forget to look at the moon once in a while and see all its beautiful luminescent qualities, you know, effervescent light shining. That's what we're after. We're not after the finger. The finger is our friend. The finger is meant to help us. But a lot of people, due to their ignorance, they mistake the finger for something else, and they try to— it's, you know, they get too attached.

**Speaker B:** They make it another neurosis. Yes, like another Dukkha. Yes, the rules, the precepts, maybe.

**Speaker A:** Yes, and the precepts, these guidelines, they're meant to help us. They're meant to help end Dukkha for ourselves and others if possible. They're not meant to cause more dissatisfaction. They're meant to help us find satisfaction through the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path. That Dhammarato likes to call the Eightfold Noble Doorway, and I agree with him, because a path would imply more of this Western mindset of I must get somewhere that I'm not, I must run the race, climb the mountain. But a doorway, particularly on the tip of the nose with our breath, is a doorway to the ever-present peace. We're thinking of bills we have to pay, getting all anxious, getting all of these delusions going. And then we have to change— remember, first we have to remember, because you can't change what you don't remember to look for. If I'm walking on a trail and there's dog shit everywhere, if I don't remember to look for it, I can't gently step aside it in a beautiful little dance, walk around the dog.

**Speaker B:** That's very telling, because here where I live in south of Spain, they're very bad at picking up their dog poo, you know. So you gotta keep that attention when you go out for a nice walk.

**Speaker A:** Same in the US, probably.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah, here it's terrible. But yeah, I wish they could have been as— they were very good at giving you fines if, you know, during the— after the lockdown, you know, when you were let out. But you know, now the cops should apply the same, you know, fanatic to the— because there's a lot. Anyway, what are the Five Precepts? Can we go through them?

**Speaker A:** Five Precepts? Oh, well, I'm not a scholar, but basically, generally speaking, and I'm sure I'll miss some, and this is not my specialty, but it's along the lines of not killing, Not stealing, not lying, not lusting after women. But when they say the lusting— sexual misconduct. But I don't mind saying lusting because it kind of also gives the lusting for the material objects as well. But sure, sexual misconduct. And.

**Speaker B:** I don't know, intoxication.

**Speaker A:** Intoxication. There you go. And, uh, yeah, so I would recommend not drinking alcohol. Not smoking is a wonderful way to be. Not killing, wonderful way to be. Not stealing, being honest. Nothing wrong with the precepts.

**Speaker B:** But then again, killing is easy. I don't kill, right?

**Speaker A:** But sometimes people can take it too far. They'll accidentally kill a mosquito. And their whole day is ruined because they broke a precept. And it's like, it's like, oh my God, I've done this. But it's like, it's a general guideline so you're not running around like a madman killing all these beautiful creatures, killing your fellow brothers and sisters. Exactly. It's right. People get crazy with it. Oh, you eat meat, you're a killer, you do this. And you could easily just point to them and say, you're wearing rubber shoes. The rubber shoes How is that made? With oil. What does oil do? It gets spilled all over the world in the oceans. Kills all kinds of animals. So what are we to do? Just not move? Just sit there like the Buddha statue? Which wouldn't be too bad. But it reminds me of Ajahn Chah said, you know, I think it was— wait, I may be misquoting, I don't know. It was either Buddhadasa Bhikkhu or Ajahn Chah. Forgive me. I know I should know who this is, but anyways, one of those two men, they said something that was wonderful. They said, you know, I think it was Buddhadasa Bhikkhu, but he said, I've seen chickens roosting for hours, for days, for weeks, sitting there, the chicken, you know, not moving.

**Speaker B:** Oh, right.

**Speaker A:** As happy as can be. And he's like, are we to believe that they're the Arahants, you know? He's like, but the students, sometimes when they start, they get the idea of, well, in the books, in this, we get the general idea that we're supposed to sit here and just, you just chill, you know, and that's what we do. And that's good, and there's a lot of truth to that. But what Buddhadasa was saying was like, yeah, we're not— I think Ajahn Chah said this— we're not just rocks, we're not just Buddha statues sitting there, and this is— we're practicing the Dhamma. No, it's about changing the heart. We're alive. These precepts are guidelines. This culture within Buddhist communities is guidelines. If you don't have satisfaction in your heart, like Dhammarato says, if you're not reading the book that I actually am a great scholar of between the ears, then you're going to be following somebody else's words like a tape recorder. You're going to be practicing somebody else's practice that isn't really changing the Dukkha and the Sukkha. It's just going to be fulfilling some ego desires. So we have to be careful, we have to use discernment in these particular energies that come with different groups of people. But now that we've talked about some of the meat and potatoes, Do any questions or anything come to mind at all? This is not just a group where I'm like some kind of preacher, but I'm hosting this group, so anybody can talk, anybody can take over. It's no problem.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Yeah, I think that the precepts, exactly, they're quite universal and, you know, they're not meant to be taken literally, but they're good guidelines, like good good advice to kind of— but, um, I think.

**Speaker A:** For example, how much, how much is there? How much precepts is there altogether in the Mahayana? Is it like 187 or something crazy like that? Actual precepts? In the— when the monks in, uh, Thailand actually get ordained, I think it's.

**Speaker B:** Something— I don't know. I, I don't— I, I'm, I'm— but I— yeah, can you tell me a little bit about that? Because, uh, I, I'm not familiar with—.

**Speaker A:** I'm not I'm not sure how many precepts they have, but I think it's something about 187 or something. I could be wrong. I don't know.

**Speaker B:** All their, you know, there's all kinds of like how they— practical stuff as well, no, that they have to— I don't know.

**Speaker A:** I'm sure, I'm sure. And I'm sure they're there for very good reasons, you know. But I'm not a monk. So you'd better ask Dhammarato about anything to do with that type of lifestyle.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** He would know more than me. Most people in the Sangha would know more than me when it comes to scholarly things, when it comes to what had the goings-ons of different cultures and different wats and things like this. Everybody else is better to talk to. But the one thing I can help with, I believe, is the satisfaction, is the changing, is the Eightfold Path.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** Which is, you know, in the Eightfold Path, we're remembering. So that's the Sati, you know, to look. And that's the view, you know. We're remembering to look, and then remembering with the right, the right amount of effort. What's the right amount of effort? Just the right amount of effort. To change. So we're changing with our speech and our actions, and with the right unification, with the right attitude, we develop a right livelihood. You know, so all of the Eightfold Path can be summed up into beautiful things like don't worry, be happy. Because if, for example, Dogen Zenji in this beautiful movie that I've seen— I don't know if this is historically accurate— but he was eating noodles one day at his temple, or he was about to eat noodles, and one of the students came to him and said, "Master, we're in huge trouble. There's no more noodles here. We're all run out. There's a war going on on the east and no supplies have come in. We have nothing to eat." And the Master Dogen just smiled and said, "Oh, no problem. We'll just eat warm water. We'll pretend it's food. We'll drink it, but we'll pretend we're eating the warm water." See, that's the Noble Eightfold Path.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** It's encountering something that usually would cause us dissatisfaction, having the ability to remember to look and to recognize it as Dukkha. And to change it, you know, just the right amount of effort. Not a whole bunch of effort that's going to cause more Dukkha, but what is the right amount of effort? Just the right amount of effort to turn that Dukkha into Sukkha, which is joy. And then after a while, a wholesome thought, a wholesome action is to remember the breath right here, right now. There is no problems. We're just on a video call. There's nothing to sweat about. There's nothing— there's no— like Dhammarato says, there's no Russian police after us. There's no lions coming to attack us. There's no monsters. And we're reminding ourselves as we come back to the breath and we get in what I like to call the little Samadhi. We get into Samadhi, a calm mind. That's basically what Samatha is. It's a calm mind. Sure, there's more technical definitions, but people will get very disheartened when the Samadhi comes to an end. When the Samadhi, the sunshine and rainbows, peaceful feeling comes to an end, they think, am I doing something wrong? What's going on? But this is natural. I was telling my friend the other day, we're planting, we're tending to the garden of the mind.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that's a good analogy. Yeah, your mind as a garden.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and it's also a good analogy because a garden requires and can require a lot of physical work, a lot of mental work, but for the gardener who knows that he's going to have fruits after his work, it doesn't become work. He doesn't even realize all the physical activity he's doing. He enjoys it. He's having fun gardening, and that's what the Dharma is. It's not work. Sure, it requires a little effort, a little discipline, a little, a little this, little that, but it's really just playing. When you love what you do, you love the Dharma, this is not difficult, this is enjoyable. And then the fruits, the fruits will reveal themselves to you. But don't just— don't get discouraged like I was talking about. Baby Dukkhas, like Dhammarato says, little baby plants, little baby dissatisfactions will always come again after the calm Samadhi. And like the gardener, we gently take them out before they become big oak trees, big thick oak trees, and they're a little bit more difficult to come out. But when they're little babies, we get in the habit, the good mental habits of tending to our garden. And for the beginners, it could be overwhelming because they're starting off with a plot of land that's covered in brambles, covered in thorns, covered with snakes and rabbits eating all their stuff. But the wise seasoned gardener says, no, no, no, you will be a great gardener. This is how it all begins, but you have to start somewhere. And they start removing some of the Dukkha here. The master helps, the little gardening handbook helps, the Pali Canon helps, his neighbor who's a seasoned gardener, the master, he helps. You know, but then eventually what happens? He's still friends with the master. He still picks up that gardening book or reads a new gardening book every once in a while, but he's been doing it, she's been doing it for 20, 30, 40 years. And they, yes, they like the book. Yes, they still love and respect the master and are so thankful, but now they are the masters. They are the kings of their plot of land. And actually, it doesn't take 30, 40 years. It's here and now. We only think that it's all this trouble, think that it's a process. And that maybe is the only thing in that example that is not perfect, is that you don't actually even have to get to this Garden of Eden. It's born within you right now. The gardener's already done all the hard work. You just got to take care of.

**Speaker C:** It.

**Speaker A:** And build momentum throughout our day. It sounds easy. It sounds like, oh, this is so simple, and it is. But you got to remember to do it. If you don't remember, the siren call of Mara, Maya, whatever you want to call it, she will be calling you back with her beautiful tone. Come back to the world. Come back to society. Come back to worry and anxiety and fear.

**Speaker B:** Anicca. Come back to the samsaric struggles.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Those are fine, fine mud.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. And actually, the dukkha we're talking about that we're so afraid of is nothing to fear. Just like you said, it's the fertilizer for the garden. The little baby, the little baby Dukkha is the little dog shit. It's no problem. Walk around it, throw it in the garden. Yeah, yeah, the lotus flower born from the mud, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the thicker the mud, you know, it's still—.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so it's just satisfaction. It's just remembering to look. And I love how Ajahn Chah says we're gently resting in the way things are. Yes, there's this one part. Oh, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** No, yeah, it reminds me a little bit about also that they often say in some Tibetan lineage in Sochen, it's just rest as things is, as it is, you know. It's very just rest in the now. We forget to do that because our head is taking us on trips all the time, you know.

**Speaker A:** Am I— Yes, it's a practice of remembering to look and change, and then it becomes easier over time, just like anything else, just like gardening, just like weightlifting. You can't go to the gym and pick up the 200 pounds right away, try to bench press it. No, you start small, you start with the bar, add some weight over time, but it's not impossible. It's very practical. It's very doable. And that's another point that's good with talking about the Dharma. The Westerners, we look at enlightenment, we look at Nibbana, which just means a cool mind. They used to use that word for the food to take it off the fire and to let it cool down. And that's what we're doing with the mind. It's not an impossible task. It's quite enjoyable task. But sometimes it could take 20, 30 years to learn how simple it is. If you have ignorance, if you don't open your eyes to the here and now and the breath right here, right now. We're always meditating sitting down to what? Why do people sit down to what? What's that?

**Speaker B:** What did you say? We're always meditating to sit down to—.

**Speaker A:** We're always meditating in what? Quote, regular people, when they're practicing, they're always sitting down meditating to what? To get something that they don't have, to get somewhere that they're not at. And that is the root cause, the Buddha told us in the Four Noble Truths, of all Dukkha, of all dissatisfaction. Instead, you should sit down and relax, breathe in this beautiful air, smile. You are the Buddha. You're enlightened right now. It's only our delusions that's telling us we're not. It's getting us focused on the on the Anicca, Dukkha, and Arhat that we can't control. But the one thing we can control is this between our ears. And controlling is even a bad word— or not bad word, it's the wrong word. I would say more we're not controlling the mind, we're helping to form a beautiful relationship gently with the mind. We're helping to nourish it. Like a lovely plant, right?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** When we see the Dukkha on the ground, the shit on the ground, we're not freaking out that there's dog shit on the ground. We're not saying— we're not calling the police that there's dog shit on the ground. No, we're gently walking around it. A lot of spiritual schools will tell you, no, roll around in it, smell it, eat it, put it all over your face. And this is a lot of the Western psychology too, which I can be a fan of in some sense. It's not all bad, but But Dhammarato does have a point. It does get a little— it does have a tendency to over-intellectualize everything.

**Speaker B:** The psychology or the Western mystery schools? Both. Okay, okay. Yeah, I noticed that. That's what I also— I kind of like to follow these teachings. They are really refreshing. In a way, the fact that they don't, you know, it's actually gives you a different angle to the Dharma or the Dhamma, you know. This also building up the wholesomeness is a new approach from, you know, for me, which is quite interesting.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and it's ironically, it's not— oh, hi buddy! Hey, how's it going?

**Speaker B:** Hello, how's it going?

**Speaker C:** Doing fine.

**Speaker A:** Good to see you. Nice to see you. Good, good. We were just chatting about the Dhamma, per usual, but unfortunately I'm gonna have to go in about 5 minutes, just to let you guys know. Usually I'll even go over an hour of the group meeting, but today I have to leave a little earlier, and because it's recording, I don't believe you could go on. But in the Discord, you guys might be able to continue live chatting or on the live option there. But just letting you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no worries. I'm a little bit under the weather, so it's just nice to get introduced to the Sangha, you know. Really such a pleasure. Carl. I'm Brett. Nice to meet you, Brett.

**Speaker C:** Nice to meet you.

**Speaker A:** Hello. That's awesome. Yeah, he was just— Carl just was mentioning about Tibetan Buddhism, and you know, it's funny, it's not— I like how Dhammarato says, it's not my teaching, it's not my style, it's the Buddha's. He's the originator of it, which is wonderful. And I often find when I'm reading about Tibetan Buddhism, although the cultures of Thailand may be different, all other cultures of Nepal and in Tibet, these cultures are very different. And yeah, they all put their certain style in it, but I find— I don't know if it's just because I just have a tendency to look more at what binds us rather than what dissolves us. But I think they all are very well aware of the Buddhist core teachings, especially if you find the right guys talking about it. I was just reading about— I was just reading this book called The Gates to Buddhist Practice by Chagdud Tulku. I believe he's a Rinpoche. I'm not sure. It should say Rinpoche on there. But anyways, I was surprised at just how, just like Dhammarato, he was sounding It's very simple, very practical, you know, just gladdening the mind here and now, returning to the breath, the nurturing wholesome breath that everything's okay here and now. He was saying exactly that in so many words. Sometimes they're a bit more poetic or imaginative, but the same thing.

**Speaker C:** I've often found that in the teachings of Tai Situ Rinpoche as well. And he's one of the first actually writers in the Dhamma I encountered way back in 2011, just when I was reading, before I had really sat down and started following the breath consecutively.

**Speaker A:** I'm not sure if I ever read him.

**Speaker B:** That simplicity, I get that from some Sotchan teachers as well, very much as that kind of rest in the now. And I really, that's That's kind of why it also attracts me to this particular Sangha and teaching. So I look forward to going deeper. How often do you do Sangha.

**Speaker A:** Calls? Dhammarato does his on Friday and DJ does his on Saturday. I do mine obviously on Wednesday. Usually it's 1 o'clock. I had to push it forward an hour today for doctor reasons. But, and also Dhammarato does a UK one that I'm not as familiar with because it's at an early time when I'm sleeping, right? But yeah, Friday, Saturday, and Wednesday, and whatever you might have to investigate or ask Brett what the UK one is that Dhammarato does, what times those are. I believe it's at 3 in the morning for me or something like that. That.

**Speaker C:** But yeah, I think it's at 4 in the morning for me, or possibly— yeah, I think it's possibly 4 in.

**Speaker A:** The morning for me.

**Speaker C:** I did pop in there once, and something funny too, and I know that, you know, we can appreciate Dhammarato has an excellent sense of humor. It's part of his style, and it's effective, and it reaches me. But I just— the only— I think the only time I recall popping in that one— I keep using that phrase, and we're coming to— he was just talking about a spoonful of sugar. Arya Poppins, and serendipitously.

**Speaker A:** I showed up. Yeah, you're the spoonful of sugar, Brad.

**Speaker C:** The funny part too, well, the funny part is all the lights were out in the house because my family was asleep. It was 4 AM, and I did not realize it was just a black screen. I thought I was showing up, there was a light in the kitchen behind me, and but it was just a black screen. And then when I watched the video later It was a black screen. And so not only was Dhammarato on it, I was the always, it was a sense of humor, but I, through random stochastic serendipitous coincidence, I added to the punch. I was the— I punched the punchline, I guess, or my appearance or whatever.

**Speaker A:** That's awesome.

**Speaker C:** Let us say.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah, because I was following the YouTube the kind of the text in the YouTube profile, and that says 3 calls, like 3 timings, like Friday, US Friday, and then Wednesday. Are these the same? Is he calling in on Friday? And when was the other UK? Is it Sunday?

**Speaker A:** Could be Sunday.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay, so those are the 3 times.

**Speaker C:** Probably.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, if you pop in on, in a couple days on Friday to Dhammarato's, if you're able to see that, he'll clear out all that time organization for you because I'm not the best person to talk to about scholarly advice or times or locations. But the Dharma of the heart, I'm pretty good at.

**Speaker B:** That is very good. And that can be a topic that we talk a lot about mind, but you know, we need to talk more about heart as well.

**Speaker C:** Oh yes, the mind likes to talk. Sorry, it's the mind's tendency. The Citta likes to talk, the mind likes to talk.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But you know, I was with some, you know, in some other teachings, in some other context, and they brought up that we always discuss the mind, you know, in the Dharma. And, you know, and we— I think more and more is bringing forward the heart as part of the— I agree. Even also in non-dualic, you know, that we have to really— it's an important aspect, you You know, can be very mind-focused, and I think that's very good because it's what you do like this.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's a unification of the Gardener's Manual, your next-door neighbor who's the seasoned gardener, and then eventually you just have to get into the garden and do it yourself. And you're not throwing away the seasoned gardener, you're not throwing away the manual like we discussed. But you are stepping on your own two feet and you're building confidence and you're getting the fruits of the Dharma, your first tomato, your first pumpkin, and you get the wow factor of, yes, I can do this. I can change Dukkha into Sukkha. It's not a magical practice. It's coming back to reality, the breath, the wholesome nurturing reality, realizing that these things in our mind are natural and they're not very important. Not too— nothing to worry about really. But on that note, dudes, maybe you guys can stay and chat. I don't know if I leave, if you guys can stay and chat, but unfortunately I have to get going.

**Speaker B:** That was lovely to meet you guys. I'm really very nice to be part of the Sangha, and I'll— I'm gonna take off as well. I'm a little bit unwell, so it's really good.

**Speaker A:** Well, you're not unwell, you're perfect.

**Speaker B:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** Well, thank you so much.

**Speaker C:** Nice to meet you, Carl.

**Speaker B:** Nice to meet you. Thank you, guys. Cheers.

**Speaker A:** Thank you, guys.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key themes and teachings discussed:

**Core Topic:** The practical application of the Buddha's core teaching—understanding and ending *dukkha* (dissatisfaction/suffering).

**Main Themes & Teachings:**

1.  **The Heart of the Dharma:** The discussion centers on the Buddha's primary concern: *dukkha* and its cessation (*nirodha*). The goal is to transform dissatisfaction into satisfaction (*sukkha*) in the present moment.

2.  **Guidelines vs. Rigid Rules:** A significant portion of the talk critiques the tendency to turn Buddhist precepts (like the Five Precepts) into inflexible rules. Using a Zen parable about a monk saving a drowning woman, the speaker emphasizes that precepts are **guidelines** to reduce suffering, not commandments to be followed blindly if they cause more harm. The key is to "use your brain" and apply wisdom and compassion.

3.  **The Simplicity of Practice:** The path is presented as simple, practical, and accessible. It's about:
    *   **Remembering to Look:** Developing mindfulness (*sati*) to notice *dukkha* when it arises.
    *   **Applying Right Effort:** Using the appropriate amount of effort to gently change dissatisfaction into satisfaction, not by striving for a distant goal, but by adjusting one's relationship to the present.
    *   **Cultivating the "Garden of the Mind":** The mind is compared to a garden. Practice is the gentle, joyful work of tending to it—removing the "weeds" of unwholesome states when they are small and nurturing wholesome states. The "fruit" is inner peace.

4.  **Present-Moment Focus:** Enlightenment or *nibbana* (a "cool mind") is not a distant achievement but a quality accessible here and now by returning to the breath and the present reality. The problem is the delusion that we are not already whole.

5.  **Building Wholesomeness:** The approach favored in the talk is to build up wholesome, satisfying mental states rather than over-analyzing or "rolling in" negative ones. This is contrasted with some Western psychological or overly intellectual spiritual approaches.

6.  **Community & Guidance:** The value of the Sangha (community), wise friends (like Dhammarato, who is mentioned frequently), and teachings is highlighted as supportive—like a gardening manual or a seasoned gardener neighbor. However, the ultimate aim is to internalize the practice and "step on your own two feet."

**Context:** The conversation is a friendly, informal Sangha meeting hosted by Speaker A (Carl). A newcomer (Speaker B, Brett) joins, and they are later joined by another member (Speaker C). The tone is practical, down-to-earth, and occasionally humorous, emphasizing a non-dogmatic, experience-based approach to the Dhamma.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used in the talk:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The Mind as a Wiggling Worm:** Speaker B describes the unstable, fluctuating nature of the untrained mind as being like a "wiggling worm."
2.  **The Finger Pointing at the Moon:** Used to illustrate the danger of becoming attached to rules, teachings, or methods (the finger) and missing the actual goal or truth they point to (the moon). The rules are guides, not the truth itself.
3.  **The Mind as a Garden:** This is a central, extended metaphor.
    *   We are **gardeners** tending to the garden of our mind.
    *   **Dukkha (dissatisfaction)** is like **weeds** or **fertilizer (dog shit)** that can be used for growth.
    *   **Practice** is the gentle work of tending, pulling out weeds (negative thoughts/habits) when they are small before they become big, stubborn trees.
    *   **Teachers and texts** are like a **gardening manual** or a **seasoned gardener neighbor**—helpful guides, but you must do the gardening yourself.
    *   The **fruit** is the result of the practice: peace, happiness, wisdom.
4.  **Dharma as a Tool (like Fire):** The teachings are a tool that can be used wisely to warm yourself or carelessly to burn down a house. The emphasis is on wise application, not blind following.
5.  **Enlightenment/Nibbana as a "Cool Mind":** Likened to taking food off the fire to let it cool down. The goal is to cool the feverish, agitated mind.
6.  **The Breath as a Doorway:** Speaker A prefers "Eightfold Noble Doorway" over "Path" because a "doorway" implies something ever-present and accessible here and now (like the breath on the tip of the nose), whereas a "path" implies a long journey to somewhere you are not.
7.  **Mara/Samsara as a Siren Call:** The distractions of the world, worry, and anxiety are likened to a siren's call, luring the practitioner away from peace.
8.  **The Lotus Born from Mud:** A classic Buddhist metaphor mentioned in passing: beautiful growth (the lotus of wisdom/peace) arises from the mud of suffering and difficulty.

### **Stories**

1.  **The Zen Master and the Drowning Woman:**
    *   **Plot:** A Zen master breaks the monastic rule against touching a woman to save her from drowning. His student is horrified at the rule-breaking.
    *   **Moral:** The master chastises the student for being attached to the rule (the finger) and missing the compassionate purpose behind it (the moon). Rules/guidelines are meant to be applied with wisdom and heart, not followed with blind literalism that causes harm. This story directly supports the "finger pointing to the moon" metaphor.

2.  **Master Dogen and the Warm Water:**
    *   **Plot:** When told the temple has no food due to a war, Master Dogen simply suggests they happily "eat warm water" and pretend it's food.
    *   **Moral:** This exemplifies the essence of the Eightfold Path: encountering a potential source of dissatisfaction (hunger) and using right view and effort to change one's relationship to it, thus transforming dukkha into satisfaction (sukkha) through attitude.

3.  **The Chicken "Meditating":**
    *   **Plot:** Referencing Ajahn Chah or Buddhadasa Bhikkhu, the speaker mentions chickens that sit perfectly still for long periods.
    *   **Moral:** This pokes fun at the mistaken idea that the goal of practice is mere physical stillness or inactivity. True practice is about internal change of the heart, not just imitating the outward form of a statue or a roosting chicken.

**Overall Theme:** The metaphors and stories consistently emphasize **practicality, wisdom over blind rule-following, and the immediate accessibility of peace through present-moment awareness.** They warn against dogmatism, intellectualization, and mistaking the method for the goal.
