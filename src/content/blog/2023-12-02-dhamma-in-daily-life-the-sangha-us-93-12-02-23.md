### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, looks like it is going now. So guys, welcome to the Friday evening call in the US. Uh, here it's, uh, 9 o'clock on Saturday morning, and today we're going to talk about, uh, incorporating the Dharma practice in our worldly lives. Now, to start off with, I'd like to say that the Buddha— well, hello, Corey. Hello, good to see you. Um, in the time of the Buddha, uh, he was quite successful at getting people to understand, um, how to change their lives. And that it looks like that by the time of the death of the Buddha, there were like 20,000 monks, 20,000 Bhikkhus, and about 10% of them by then had gotten it completely. But there's also a great deal of indication that most of his students in fact were not actually ordained. That they lived lives as ordinary people. The word that was used was householder, and the word householder actually has some connotation of those who own property, hold a house, because the Sudras, those who had no property, they had possibly nothing, much of a good job or anything, those were the ones who would go ahead and ordain and go live out in the woods happily. But the people who owned property found that it was difficult for them to— in fact, someone today had just posted about the Antrapitika, or the Anapanasati Anapanasati, who was a very famous banker who took care of most of the banking issues that the monks had. And so I'll put a little point on that, and that is that in modern-day times, we use the example of Anthropitika for banking, that Arahant Janissaro has said that because of the the fact that any money, any small amounts of money that were donated to a monk, that would be kept by the banker, and that all they needed to do was to write a little note, a little chit, saying, "Oh, give this money so that this robe or this bowl or this item could be purchased." And so that gives freedom to the modern monks, so that they can have bank accounts, and that a check would be exactly the same thing, writing a check to your bank. Would be exactly the same role that Anthropythica did for all of the monks in the time of the Buddha, and that he was quite famous for his devotion to the Buddha. And there have been other lay people who were quite famous for being able to teach the Dhamma. And so don't see it as a black or white kind of issue. See it as more of a convenience issue, or whether or not you're going to ordain or live in a wat, or whether you're going to live the life out in the world. But even if we're living the life in the world, we can still practice the Dharma in a beautiful way, that we can live a happy wholesome, healthy life out in the world. And all of it has to do with your change of attitude, that you can actually go and do anything that you want to do, so long as you're not harming yourself or harming others, so long as you can do what you're doing happily. Now, getting into that, one of the points that I would like to make is is, is that at any point in time throughout society, society has been bad, it's been messed up. An example of that is, is I don't think that there's ever been on the planet Earth an actually good government. Every government that we've ever had, every President of the United States, any kind of government that we've ever had in Europe has all been flawed. Not a good one has ever happened. But the question is, is can the Dharma dudes handle that? Because we can't go and fix the government. But in fact, if you decide to go and make your own government and start running the show, becoming a dictator or whatnot, you will probably screw it up, then at least half the people will hate you. One example of that would be Rome, that I had, because of history lessons and interest in Latin and all kinds of stuff, have done quite a lot of study about Rome, from how it got started, what happened with the wars up until Caesar, how Caesar became an emperor, how he got stabbed to death for it, up through Nero and all of the emperors. And we could go to say that no matter how big Rome got, it was messed up year by year, time after time. Not one good thing really happened that lasted. And finally, the whole empire fell apart. It got so decadent. So nowadays Everybody is complaining about how bad it is, or how bad it's going to get. We've got global warming, we've got population decline. In fact, the news is that one country like Italy is really in a mess. Their global warming is really going to affect the Mediterranean. And Venice is already getting flooded to the point that the city is almost unusable. Miami is the same way. But one thing that we can understand is that cities born, get raised up, get to be great big things, and then they die. A city has a lifespan. That in fact you could go so far as to say that New York City has been in decline for quite a long time. They go bankrupt, corrupt politicians, all of that kind of stuff. Now, when I was a monk staying at Wat Thai, Washington, D.C., one of the things that— it was kind of a political thing, but the monks were invited to go on various tours. One of the tours that we took was of the Library of Congress. They took us down into the basement to show us all the library stuff of ancient Buddhist literature, which basically meant that they had gone into the temples in Asia and robbed them of artifacts and took back and put into the Smithsonian Institute or put into this museum or that museum and kind of worship the relics of old times. And one of the things that I saw when I was visiting some of the offices in Washington, I kind of noted that this happened over and over again, and that was that they would have a Xerox piece of paper that had a line drawing on it. And that this was posted on many bulletin boards at the time. It was kind of like a fad that just went all over Washington. And what it was is it was a line drawing of a guy standing waist deep in water of a pond, and he was surrounded on all four sides by alligators. And that the caption of this was, when you're up to your hips in alligators it's hard to remember that your original intention was to drain the swamp. I think, in fact, this is the place where that whole idea of draining the swamp in Washington, D.C. came from, was this picture. And that everybody who goes to Washington goes to Washington bright-eyed, bushy-tailed, they become an assistant this, or a little bit of that, a lot of it is volunteer work, so that you can get close to the Senators and judges and all of that kind of stuff. And so everybody goes, young people go, with the idea that they're going to fix the place, they're going to drain that swamp. And within a few years, they become one of the alligators that is preventing the next generation of young people from draining the swamp. Now we have actually to point it out, Pedro has now gotten into school, and he's probably gotten into a class where the teacher is very environmentally oriented. And I can imagine that that's really the case in Italy, because Italy is facing a lot of severe problems with their population decline. Well, actually, There's no real problem with population decline. I mean, at one time they were worried about the population explosion. Back in the 1970s, in most of the Third World countries, all of the women would have 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 kids, hoping that 1 or 2 of them would grow up to adulthood. And then the UN came in with the World Health Organization and started giving out contraceptives and getting good medical care. And then all of those babies that were born, some 7, 8, or 9 kids to each woman, grew up into adulthood. And there was a population explosion, especially in India, Indonesia, and several other countries. And so then they started worrying about that. Oh, we've got a population explosion. So the first they worried about, oh, too many children are dying. Then they started worrying about the population explosion. But meanwhile, the women themselves started having fewer babies. And so now in Italy, they're down to like 1.7 or something like that, which means that for every woman that goes to adulthood, she only has like 1.7 babies on average. And that means that the population is going to start declining precipitously. That's also the case with China, because of their one-child policy, etc., like that. But meanwhile, in India, it's still like 2.5 or 2.3, something like that. And so India is still growing, while other countries that in fact, in the indigenous population of the United States, It's also declining, but a lot of immigration keeps the population high. Now, the reason that we can look at this is to recognize that at any particular point in time, we always look back into the back old times and talk about the Golden Age, the Golden Age of Rome. Well, I'll tell you what, there was never a Golden Age in Rome. Anybody who lived in Rome didn't like what was happening right now and wanted to make it better. And here we have now, this particular age that we're in now, we don't like it, we want to make it better. And when we make some changes, and so they say, "Oh, global warming," and so now we've got electric automobiles, but because of the electric automobiles, now we need lithium, and now we've got new lithium mines putting even more And so the human race is actually, in their efforts to help things and improve the world, we often make things worse, even with the very best of intentions. This is the issue, is that when are any of us going to start understanding that it is not the world that needs to be fixed? That what really needs to be fixed is our own mind. We can't fix the world. You could not become the president or the mayor or the emperor or the king of any nation or any country and fix it. You're always going to have a whole bunch of people who were against you. For instance, if you clean it up and clean out the corruption, all of the people who have corruption in their mind is not going to like what you're doing, and they're going to try to stop you. Meanwhile, if you are corrupt and all the people around you are corrupt, which is probably the predominant number— I mean, everybody would be corrupt if they had a chance, thinking that they could get away with it. Then all the clean-minded people are going to be against it. So you're always going to have a conflict in society. You can't please everybody. That, in fact, that reminds me of the statement that Abraham Lincoln made, that you can fool some of the people all the time, you can fool some of the people all the time. You can fool all the people some of the time, but you can't fool all the people all the time. So we can change that into: you can solve some problems all the time. You can solve some of the problems, but not all of them. You can't fix the world. The only thing that we can fix is our own mind. And so once we fix our own mind, we've got a better chance of fixing some of the world, the world that is around us, what we can actually do for ourselves. Can we do that happily, or do we have to be miserable at it because we're dissatisfied with the results, we're dissatisfied with the way things are? And we want to make them better and better. That's in fact what happens with each one of us, is what they call starry-eyed or bright and bushy-tailed, and we go off on our own personal crusade to go get something done, and we wind up being the villain. We go into the swamp to drain the swamp, and within a few years we become one of the alligators. Why is that? It's because it's always about self-preservation, that we want to survive, we want to fix things, we want to make life easy for us. And so if we continue that way, we're always going to be one foot in one side and one foot in the other, of yes and no. You can't find an actual good solution to anything because things are just way too complicated. The question is, is can you solve your own mental problems so that you can come into a state of happiness? That's the way to look at it. You can in fact go and learn about global warming, maybe put up some solar cells on your house, or buy a Tesla, or any of that, but that's not going to solve any of your problems. In fact, if you do put solar panels up on your house, you're going to have to maintain it, you're going to have to wash the solar panels, you're going to have to repair it when it's broken. It's not going to give you the return on your investment that you wanted, and you'll wind up being dissatisfied whether you put up solar panels or not. The same thing with the car. If you buy a Tesla, it's going to get in a wreck. I heard, and in fact, that the problem with Teslas is because of the way that they're manufactured, with having so much of the frame done in one press. They're not. It's not possible. Once you wreck it, it's completely wrecked. It's going to take almost as much money to repair the car as it took to buy it in the first place. Batteries wear out. Everything. This is one of the major teachings of the Buddha, Anicca, Vana, Sankhara. Everything that is put together, any activities, anything that we do It's going to fall apart, sometimes right in our hands. So, the question is, can you in fact enjoy making something when you know it's going to break? And then, can you happily repair it, knowing it's going to break again? This is the whole point about the teaching of the Buddha, is to see how we manufacture dissatisfactions within our own minds, because we don't like it when things are different than we're told that they should be. So we always have this idea of a set of standards that, "Oh, Italy should not flood." "Oh, Miami should not flood." "Oh, we should have better cars." "We should not use oil." We should do this, we should do that, and in the airwaves that we have, all of the news media and the outlets are setting new standards on a regular basis for us to live up to. And sometimes we don't like those new standards, and sometimes we do like the new standards, and then we don't like that the new standards are not being kept up. And so almost all human behavior is done from the perspective of not liking things, or wanting things to be different than they are, and we're not ever satisfied with the way things actually are. And so we're out there working and slaving and doing and going to school and taking courses, and we wind up being dissatisfied. Or we can get a meditation practice, get it going, and then we become dissatisfied with our meditation practice because we're not getting anywhere with it. And the answer to that is, yeah, that's the whole goal. Let's not try to get anywhere with our meditation. Let's be satisfied with the way that it is. This is the real issue, is that we become dissatisfied with any and everything that we can see. Anything that you look at, you can become dissatisfied with. An example of that is that everybody hears about how wonderful New York is, and so they go for a visit, but then when they see what's really there, they don't want to stay there. You've heard probably the cliché, "It's a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there." Well, you can apply that little metaphor to any place. Any place is nice to visit, but you don't want to stay there until you come into your own mind that where I am is good enough. When you see that where you are is good enough, that means that you allow yourself to feel at home.— that we don't have to keep visiting, looking for something better and better. What we can do instead is change our own mental attitude so that we can see things the way that they really are and recognize that that's good enough. Dhamma Dasa, I've been seeing that you've been nodding your head a lot. Do you have any comments to make? No, I just agreeing with you. All right, how about you, Corey? Do you have any comments to make?

**Speaker B:** Not at this stage.

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato. All right, how about anybody? How about, uh, um, Eamon, do you have anything to say?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I do.

**Speaker A:** It's kind of tangential. You.

**Speaker B:** Know, in trying to remain satisfied, I mean, there's no trying in it, of course, but desire is something very subtle and very.

**Speaker A:** Sweet.

**Speaker B:** It causes Dukkha, but at the same time, when it comes up, it's very sweet at.

**Speaker A:** First. Right. So what I'm saying is not that we can't go do anything. We can't do anything about global warming. We can't do anything about a government. But basically, we can do things But we're more successful when we enjoy what we're doing. And yet in our society, we have been trained to do things from the perspective of: it's broken, we need to fix it. We've lost our Golden Age, we've lost whatever, and that right now the whole world is going to hell in a handcart. Well, things have been going to hell in a handcart at any stage along the way. You've got a majority of people who are dissatisfied with whatever is happening right now. Whatever is happening, we don't like it. So how can we begin to change this? This is the whole point of The practice of Anapanasati is to become satisfied. Now, the easy way to do that, the Buddha talks about it, is the easy way is to gain, to get away from it all, to get ourselves into seclusion so that the only thing that we really have to deal with now is the old input, the old stuff that we've been carrying in the mind. So that we're not going to have to deal with any new stuff that's coming up. We're busy just dealing with the dissatisfactions that we've got as a habit pattern, all of the old stuff. And so what we can do is practice throwing out all of that old stuff, coming into the reality of right now, which is actually pretty good. Almost all of your problems, almost all of the problems that you ever had to think about or care about or do something about, was either in the past or in the future. Problems that needed to be solved are problems that weren't solved. And in fact, that's how we use the past, is we use the past to look at how broken it was and say, well, that means that it's got to be fixed in the future. And so we spend all of our time at the extremes of in the past and in the future. And the past is gone, it can't be fixed, it's dead already. You can't dig up the past, give it cardiac jolt with lightning or with the machines that the doctors use, and bring the past back to life. People die, but your past is dead, and yet we carry it around like a badge. The phrase from old ancient Rome is, "Don't rest upon your laurels." Yeah, you did something in the past, and when somebody got some goal or something, that they would have a little crown of laurel leaves. But those leaves die. Nobody wants to wear an old crown of laurel because it's not green and beautiful anymore. It died. We throw out flowers. You know, it's very romantic, and every girl loves to have flowers given to her. But then within a week, the flowers are dead. So when we begin to recognize that most of life's problems come from digging up our own past, and then trying to fix it out into the future is where all of our problems lie. But the reality right now is that you don't have any problems except those that you can dream up. Corey, all of your problems are either in your past or in your future, but right now, in this very moment, while you're sitting here on this call, you've got no problems. Is that correct? It is. Yeah, right now you've got no problems. So if we can stay in the present moment, there are no problems to fix. Pedro, right now, do you have any problems? I mean, I know that you've been studying global warming and everybody in Italy is really afraid about sea level changes and population and running out of money. But right now, aren't you okay? Oh yes, yes, yes. Right now we're okay. This is the whole point about it. Can you actually see that right now is okay? Even if we become scatterbrained and we can't concentrate and we think that our meditation practice is going to hell, let it go to hell, that's okay. Can I be satisfied that my meditation is no good? Rather than always wanting to make it better. It's not good enough now. And we can come back to making that one big change in attitude from being the victim. The victim is the one who wants to make things better because they don't like it. The way that it is, that they are being oppressed, suppressed, attacked. And basically all of that suppression and all of that attacking is from our own rule systems about how things ought to be. And when we stop attacking ourselves and start nurturing ourselves instead, instead of being critical of ourselves, we can nurture ourselves and say everything right now is all right, everything is okay. And we can practice that over and over again in seclusion until we begin to let it sink in. But yeah, it's not the swamp out there in Washington that needs to be drained, it's the swamp in the mind that needs to be drained. Yes, it's not the sea level rise out there in Italy in Venice. The sea level rise is right here in our mind, and we can change that when we see it. That's the whole point about practicing Anapanasati. You see, all of the stuff that we have going on with the world is generally an unwholesome thought. We want to make the world better so that we will feel better. And the question is, why can't we just feel better without having to fix anything in the world? You could just feel better, just start feeling better, just saying everything is already okay. I don't have to worry about anything. I'm not in danger right now. And if we can develop that habit so that we can feel good whenever anything happens, then even the worst thing that could possibly happen, we can still feel good about it. Even if you get stopped by the cops, you could still feel good about it. Whatever happens is okay if we can manage our own mind. Now, just like we would begin as a beginner, we want to get away from all of the heavy stuff until we get some skills. The example that I generally use is going to the gym. Almost everybody goes to the gym saying that, "I need to pump iron," or whatever. And then they go to the great big heavy dudes, the big dumb barbells that weigh 100 pounds or so. And really what we need to do is to take just 1 little kilogram, a little dumbbell, and do it over and over and over and over and over again, get some reps going. Build the muscles very slowly. So we need to build the muscles of our mind very slowly, one thought at a time. So Pedro, every time that you think about global warming, that's a little dumbbell that you can pump up a little bit and says, I'll do global warming later. Right now my job is to clean out my mind. So anybody who has any problems with any government at all, instead of having a government problem, realize that it's only a thought of the government that's your problem right now. The actual government is not an issue. What's an issue is, is that you don't like it right now, which is a very little thought, nothing to it. Can we change that? Can we pump that and say, okay, I don't like the government, but I can be happy right now because I can't change the government right now, but I can change my mind right now. I can change it. This is the practice, is right now, whatever thought that you're having that's bringing not liking to you, you can change it. So that you can feel better right now. This is the way. Now there is a thing called Western Buddhism, and that it looks like that it's becoming quite distinct because it's got Western culture as its base, as opposed to Tibetan Buddhism. In fact, there is no such thing as Tibetan Buddhism. What there is instead is Buddhism in Tibetan culture. There's no such thing as Thai Buddhism. What we have instead is the teaching of the Buddha that's been, let us say, saddled up beside Thai culture. And now we have a kind of Buddhism that is immersed in Western culture, and the culture often defines things rather than the actual practice of Buddhism. And so when people get really deeply into the Dharma and really like it a lot, they want to become teachers, they want to talk about it all the time. And so they begin to think, well, I'll become a Dharma teacher. And then the old stuff comes up, the old rule: you gotta work to eat. And so they see now teaching the Dharma as a job to do, rather than as a pleasure to share. And they wind up charging money for it. In fact, Western Buddhism is more in the model of psychotherapy than it is in the old teachings of the Buddha. When all that needed to be ordained was, "Oh, come, eh, eh, Pasiko, come see for yourself, come check it out." 'Come live in the woods with us and enjoy your life.' But in the Western Buddhism, we have the Western model of client and therapist. You got to pay for it. And then if you pay for it, then you have the point of, 'Well, I paid the psychologist for their services. Fix me.' And no psychologist is going to be able to fix anyone. What the psychologist can do with the Dhamma especially is to begin to point out to the people that they can fix their own mind, that they can change, that they can see their problems as temporary, in the moment, no big deal, and that we can change that right here, right now. We can come out of our dissatisfactions and start counting our blessings. Everything is okay right now. I'm still breathing. That's an important point. Yeah, I can still breathe. No matter how bad my past was, no matter what kind of troubles there were, it didn't kill me. I'm still alive. Let me rejoice at being able to survive my past. Didn't get me. So here I am, all happy and everything. And these are very little weights that we can pick up and start carrying, start pumping little weights. The little weight of the just enough effort, right? Noble effort means just the right amount of effort to make a change. And the only change that we need to really make is to stop being unhappy and disgusted with the world and get our minds back into good shape, being happy with the way things are. But we can find all kinds of things to complain about. Corey, how many different things can you find to complain about? I could probably complain about it quite a bit if I tried. Yeah, right. So how many things can you feel really good about? Probably not as many, but a few. All right, so let's stay with those few that I bet— and in fact, if you start practicing thinking about all the good things, you'll begin to add new ones— that you can count your sheep, or not count your sheep and all their problems with the sheep, you can count your blessings. You can remember everything is okay right now, not a problem in the world, then in fact it's an important kind of point to recognize that the amount of good is very small, but the amount of things that go bad is enormous. Same thing is true with truth versus lies. Versus falsehoods, right? Um, let's play an experiment. Corey, how old are you? 42. All right, now lie to me. How old are you? 24. Lie to me again. How old are you? 36. Okay, so there is only one particular age And it depends upon the range that we're having of accuracy, as you can give it by a year, or you can give it a year and months, or you can give it years, months, and days, maybe even down to the moment. But there's only one age that we have, depending upon the accuracy. But how many lies can you tell me about how old you are? Quite a few. All right, now let's then say that the reality is actually in a way small as compared to the amount of delusions that we can come up with about it. How many lies can we tell ourselves about how bad things are, where in fact there's a whole lot fewer things to have to say about how good things are. So that actually makes it easier, doesn't it? Because look at all that heavy lies that we tell ourselves. All of them together makes it a great big burden, something like Atlas carrying the world around on his shoulders. That's the situation that Petro has gotten himself into, is carrying all the burdens of the world, or at least all the burdens of Italy, to where in fact the reality of the situation is actually quite lightweight. So let's set down the burdens, let's take the effort to drop all of that stuff and recognize that we're already okay. And when we get ourselves okay, then we can find some toy to play with, like global warming. Yeah, let's build a bridge, let's build a dam, let's have fun doing it, rather than doing it because it needs to be done. Going back to the analogy of in the pond, we're in the pond to drain the swamp. Well, if we were in the pond to play, then we can play with the alligators. We don't have to do anything, we can just enjoy what we're doing. So if you're writing a website, the question is, can you enjoy doing it? Or if it comes to the point of, oh, it's true, I can't solve that problem, it's too much, and I don't like what's going on, go take a break, get your mind back in clarity, and when you come back to the issue, you can probably solve it. But we get stuck in trying to get something done and work and slave and do all the stuff that we can do, and we're still dissatisfied. So the real practice of the Dharma is to get our mind back into a state that everything is all right right now. Let us say that you were a psychotherapist and you've got a client sitting right in front of you, and that 'Your client will not understand what you're trying to say to him.' The answer to that is, 'That's okay. Let me be pleasant and happy. Maybe he can see the pleasantness and the happiness that I have as an example, rather than me being miserable trying to get him to understand what I'm saying. At least he can understand that I can be happy while we talk about his problem, because it's really not a problem right now anyway. It's just a concept that he's dealing with. So this is actually, this Dhamma applies everywhere we go. There is not one problem that the Dhamma does not have a great impact on, because really it's not the problem, it's our attitude about the problem, and that their attitude is obviously not in the best shape because we're calling it a problem, when in fact it's not a problem. The problem is our attitude about it, and if we can change our attitude, then it's no longer a problem, it's no longer an issue. Now it's just a toy to play with. Let's have fun with it. Pedro, can you have fun with global warming? Can you have fun watching Venice flood? Have fun watching the economy of Italy fall.

**Speaker C:** Apart. Do we need to have fun, or we just can look at it? Why we need to be happy about it? We just can observe it. It's about this equanimity stuff, right? Why to have fun? It's maybe it's a wordplay, but why fun?

**Speaker A:** Well, it is a wordplay. Let's play with the words so that we can come into a nice, comfortable, happy position about the words that we're using rather than making ourselves miserable with them. This is what the whole teaching of the Buddha is about, and we have to do it in a two-step operation. The first step is to make it as easy on ourselves, keep practicing, doing it over and over and over and over and over again until we get pretty good at it, and then we can start adding some weight to it so that we can handle the weight easily. The example of that would be, if I can get myself into seclusion, begin to feel really good about myself, then I can feel really good about myself and others. If I can make friends with myself, then I can make friends with anybody. If I criticize myself and say, "This is this rule and I have to keep this rule," then when I find people breaking that rule, I don't make friends with them. I rub their breaking my rule in their face. Christianity is really good at that. They don't keep their own rules, but they'll sure try to make everybody else suffer because they don't keep the Christian rules. But as Buddhists, we don't proselytize, we don't try to convert people, we don't try to make them have babies or not get abortions or whatever like that. We're happy with whatever happens in the world because our disposition already has been trained to be happy. So when somebody else has a problem, to me it's not a problem. It's some toy to play with. Can— in fact, the real issue is, is can you change your mind rather than solving the problem? But if the truck needs a new battery, I can fuss and fume and not like it and have all kinds of trouble because the truck won't start. I can just happily say, oh, the truck doesn't start, it needs a new battery, we'll get one. And then we get a new battery happily. Oh, it's too much money, it's $150 for a battery. And then I feel bad again, rather than, hey, I've got enough money, I can afford it, I'm not going to miss any meals because the battery was expensive, so let's just play with it, just put a new battery in and feel good about it and go on our way. So, whatever the problem is, it's our attitude about it, not the actual issue. This is why we need to train the mind in seclusion, is so that we can make it easy to change our attitude. Because right here in the present moment, you've really got no problems. The only problems that you have are the problems that you think up. And when you see that you're thinking of a problem, you can say, hey, it's only a mental problem that I've made up. Let's change that into being happy right now. Let's throw those unwholesome thoughts out. Let's throw those doubts out. Let's throw those worries out. Let's throw those desires out. And come back and say everything is all right, everything is fine, not a worry in the world. And wow, what a relief it is. There's no troubles, no traumas, nothing. And if we keep practicing that over and over and over again, it will seep into the deepest levels so that we can feel good about whatever happens. And then, we can go out and deal with that mess of a world out there, knowing that it's broken, we can still be happy. That's the real issue, is let's get the mind to the point that we can be happy, and then we can deal with all everybody else's worries and troubles. But we don't see it as worries and troubles, we see it as just another toy to play with. So Alex, do you have anything to say?

**Speaker B:** I've been really enjoying— I was reading The Record of Linji. He talks about the businessless person, person who's got nothing to do, just be ordinary. And I'm really enjoying it in terms of I kind of get to reframe my music career as a way to pass the time, right? Yeah, instead of a way to affirm.

**Speaker A:** My self-worth, you know, just play with it. That's what they mean by playing music. Most people, when they play music, they don't really play with the music. They work at it, they struggle, they form. They practice. They don't like it when they make a mistake, instead of just enjoying. Just play music, mistakes and all, misfingering and all. That's okay. And in fact, if you worry about the mistakes that you make, play Gershwin, because Gershwin's got so many tritones and so many off-key notes that even if you play the 'Backseat in Blue' and make 100 mistakes, nobody's going to know it, because the mistakes were written right into it. So let's learn to play with life. If you're a psychologist and the client is not getting it, that's just a toy. Just play with it. No reason for you to feel bad because the client's not getting anywhere. At least you can be in a good joyful mood, and when you're in a good joyful mood, that will help the client get into his own good joyful mood. But in fact, that's really how we teach the Dharma, is by spreading the joy. A lot of people say, oh, I want to be a teacher, I want to teach the Dharma. Well, the best way to teach the Dharma is with your smile. To smile, to be happy. To be joyful. And then somebody will ask you, "Well, why are you so happy all the time?" The answer is, is because I don't have any worries. And I can teach you how to not have any worries. But we don't proselytize, we don't try to sell the Dhamma, we don't try to give it to somebody, ram it down their throat. Instead, we just go around as a shining example. Just be happy, and the whole world will start appreciating you for that. Now, I'm not talking about all the people that you don't know. I'm talking about your world, or all the people that you actually contact. And so everybody that you do contact, contact them with your joy, contact them with your happiness, contact them as if they were a friend of yours never mind how many burdens and problems and sufferings they carry around. You don't have any. But we have to practice that in solitude. We have to actually practice that over and over and over and over and over again, so that when the weighty situation of those people come and try to give us their troubles too, if I don't have any troubles, it's a whole lot easier to see what their trouble is, is no trouble at all. But if I've got a whole lot of troubles and they bring their trouble to me, now I've got double trouble. So this is how we learn to deal with the world, is by learning to deal with our own mind in private, in seclusion, making friends with ourselves, nurturing ourselves, taking the rules away from ourselves, all of our shoulds and woulds and coulds, and just be satisfied with the way things are. That in fact, the globe is going to have trouble. Wow, things are going to get really, really bad, according to the ordinary mentality. I mean, AI is really dangerous. What AI is, it's got many dangers, and one of them is the danger of putting everybody out of work. What would happen if the population, let us say the unemployment rate, rose to 30 or 40%? Because it can. What would happen with the planet Earth if the unemployment rate rose to 30%? Well, that means that 30% of the people have no trouble, they've got no problems, they've got no worries. They could go water-ski, or play sports, or sit at home and do nothing. But it doesn't look like that because all those people, those 30% unemployed, are going, "Oh, poor me, I can't find a job. Oh, AI is taking everything away from me," right? And it's all a matter of attitude. So don't worry about the future. The future is going to be just fine. The only problem with the future is people's attitude about it. Knowing that, can you fix your own attitude? Can you get in the swamp and play in the swamp rather than trying to drain the swamp and then eventually becoming one of the alligators? Everything is really easy. If you have the right attitude. So let's get that attitude going, let's get that joy, let's get that lack of fear, because basically what's all the problem is, is that we were afraid. We're afraid of what happened in the past, and we're afraid of what's happening in the future. Can we come to a state to where we feel safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied? You keep practicing safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied, and you can handle anybody else's big deals. Does anybody have any questions about any of this? Anybody ready to go practice so that you can be pleasant and happy? How about you, Anna? Can you be happy with your clients that don't understand anything you're.

**Speaker C:** Saying? My clients are best people, but I am in New York, so, you know, your happiness sometimes makes people triggered and they get pretty aggressive. So if you're smiling on the street, You make me— you can make people.

**Speaker A:** Very upset because— ah, but they— you can't make people upset. You can't do that. You can't upset people, but they can sure upset themselves with a smile. They see your smile and they decide to get upset. You keep smiling at them and they'll get over that upsetness and start to smile too. Okay, but if you smile and they get upset, and then you get upset because they're upset, Now, where are we? But if you can smile and they get upset and you smile back and they get even more upset and you smile back again, eventually their upsetness is going to be influenced by your smile.

**Speaker C:** I was succeeding in it, but then last week I got hit on by somebody because I get too angry. So it was because I was too happy. I looks like I passed it through and I'm happy back. But it was an interesting experience. Because it was just already like too much in my— how do you call.

**Speaker A:** It— in my private space, right? The question is, is can you let them hit you and you still be happy? Then in fact, the real happiness would be that they hit me and it didn't bother me. You can hit me and that's okay. I can still be happy. You can strangle my throat and I'll happily die while you're doing it.

**Speaker C:** So how do we get there?

**Speaker A:** Well, this takes practice. This is what takes practice. Yes, you smile at them, they get angry at you. You have to be able to continue to smile rather than getting unhappy because they are unhappy and they are trying to sell you their unhappiness. They don't want you to be happy because they're jealous of you. But instead, you can teach them to be happy by smiling at them, by not allowing them to make you unhappy. That is your mind that gets unhappy, not theirs. You choose to get unhappy when they're hitting on you. And the answer to that is, well, if they hit me, I have a choice. Am I going to become angry and try to hit them back, or am I going to be able to tolerate and handle that they hit me? That's the issue, is how good are you at keeping your own cool? Cool off, settle down, enjoy life. Aren't you glad? In fact, I got to tell you this. This is— this actually comes from a sutta. And that was that the monk was getting ready to go really far traveling into another country. That actually happened in the time of the Buddha. In fact, in the Buddha's day, they had already gotten into Europe. In Buddha's day, they had already gotten into China. In fact, we know that for sure with China. Is because we've got some Chinese literature that's older than most of the sutras. So this guy was getting ready to go out, and the Buddha says, well, what happens if they start throwing mud clods at you? And he— and the monk says, well, I'll be happy that they didn't throw stones. And the Buddha says, well, if they throw stones at you Then the monk says, "Well, that means that I'll be happy that they didn't shoot me with a bow and arrow." And the monk— and the Buddha says, "Well, what happens if they shoot the bow and arrow?" And the answer that the monk gave is, "Well, at least I won't die. I'll be happy that they didn't kill me." And then the Buddha says, "Well, what happens if they kill you?" And then that monk says, "Whew! What a relief!" Now I don't have any troubles at all anymore. Okay, so this is the way to start looking at it. I notice now, Anna, that you're really smiling, that yeah, they may hit you because they're angry at you smiling at them, but they didn't kill you. And so you've got still something to smile about. And then if they do kill you because they're so angry at you because you smiled at them, wow, what a relief it is! Now I don't have to deal deal with those angry people ever again. So this is the way to look at it, is that you really don't have any troubles. All the troubles that you ever had, you manufactured. And we started manufacturing trouble when we were little kids. We didn't know how to handle trouble, and so we thought that it was a great big problem. Now we can handle trouble really easily, because we know that the troubles are always somebody else's troubles, not mine. They're not my problem. They can't touch me. They can't touch me. I think there's a modern song, "Dhammarato can't touch me." So stay joyful. But in order to stay joyful, we got to get joyful. And in order to get joyful, we got to practice. Because if we don't practice being joyful, we'll wind up being back into misery simply because that's our old habit. So be happy when they hit you. At least you didn't kill you. You can continue to smile and they get even more angry and they'll hit you again. That's okay. Can you see that I'm not angry at you? Can you see that even though you hit me, I'm still all.

**Speaker C:** Right? But somehow I can't do it mentally, but it somehow went to body sensations. So it was, I was kind of shaken inside. I had pain in my body more than in my mind. I am pretty stable mentally, but somehow physically the emotion was shaken more physically, not mentally. I don't know. So it was more physical.

**Speaker A:** Emotion. And you don't like it. This is actually a major point, Dhamma Das. This is a major point that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa taught, that when we are sick or when we're injured, that's the time to practice. Yeah. So, so what if he hit me? I survived. So what if he hit me? I can handle that. It was not all of that painful. Pain, I know what pain is, I've really had pain, and I was able to survive it every time. An example is right now, I've got mosquitoes biting my feet. That's okay, I've had mosquito bites before, I was able to get over it. I'll get over these. I don't have to worry about the mosquitoes biting my feet. They've bitten me before. I'll survive. And if I don't, wow, what a relief that'll be. So you can handle the pain. The problem with not handling pain is because we don't like it. And we can change from not liking it to being able to put up with it. I can tolerate it. There's nothing to it. This is the way that we can do that, but we have to practice it. Now, I'm not recommending to sit there with your feet open letting the mosquitoes bite it just so you can handle the pain, but if you do get the mosquito bites, be happy that they didn't hurt you. But the pain from it is actually me not liking it. So this is the whole teaching, is to be able to handle with a smile anything that happens. And then you will be the master of your own mind and master of your own world, because you can feel the way that you want to feel. Rather than feeling based upon the old habits of not liking to get hit. Here's a point: when kids are playing, oftentimes a kid gets hurt, but they don't mind. If they get hit when somebody's angry at them, "Oh, poor me, I'm in such pain." But if they get hurt the same way when they're out playing, 'Never mind, I'll just continue to play on.' So if you have the attitude that when you're out there talking to these people, just, 'We're playing a game here. Life is just a game. Let's just have fun with it.' And if you get hurt, 'Yeah, well, you know what, let's just go back and continue to play the game.' Corey, I think that you've had that before. Do you have that? Do you have that in your memory bank that There has been times when you got hurt and you just didn't care because you were having fun playing the game. Sure. Yeah. And then other times you get hurt in about the same way and, oh, poor me. Oh, I'm so suffering. Yeah. So it has to do with the attitude. Pain is an attitude. And if you don't like he hit you, then you're in misery. But if you don't care that he hit you, just continue to play the game with him. Continue to smile. Life's a joy when you let it be. So does anybody— any last comments? Pedro, do you have something to say, or did you fall asleep? Alex, how about you? You have any final remarks? No final remarks. Nothing. All right. Nothing's final. Nothing's final. I mean, how about you? I'm good, thank you. Great. Dhammarato, how about you? You okay? Oh yeah, I'm doing good. Thank you for teaching us. Excellent. You guys go have fun in that world out there. It sucks. So what? It's going to get really, really bad. Can you handle that too? Yeah, it's your fault that it's gotten really bad. Can you handle people blaming you for you not doing what they want you to do? Yeah. This is the Dharma. The Dharma is stay out of that Dukkha that everybody wants to sell you. Don't buy it. Keep your cool. Be happy. Practice, practice. Thank you, guys. This has been really a good talk. I really enjoyed this. I see a lot of people smiling. Excellent. Okay, bye. Thank you. Bye.


### Summary

Here is a concise summary of the Dhamma talk with Dhammarato and the Sangha friends:

### **Core Theme:**
The central teaching is that true Dhamma practice is about **changing our own mind, not the world**. We can live a wholesome, happy life as laypeople by shifting our attitude from dissatisfaction to contentment, regardless of external conditions.

### **Key Points:**

1. **Lay Practice is Valid:**  
   - The Buddha had many lay followers (householders) who attained deep understanding. Ordination is not the only path; practice can be integrated into worldly life.

2. **The World is Inherently Flawed:**  
   - All governments, societies, and eras have been imperfect. Trying to “fix” the world often leads to frustration or corruption (illustrated by the “drain the swamp” metaphor, where reformers become part of the problem).

3. **Problems are Mental Constructions:**  
   - Suffering arises from our thoughts about the past or future, not from the present moment. Right now, we are essentially okay.  
   - We create burdens by clinging to “shoulds” and ideals (e.g., global warming, political issues) instead of addressing our own discontent.

4. **The Practice: Cultivate Satisfaction**  
   - **Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing)** is a tool to cultivate contentment in the present.  
   - Start small: build mental “muscles” by repeatedly letting go of unwholesome thoughts and choosing to see that “everything is alright right now.”  
   - Practice in seclusion first to develop stability, then bring that joyful attitude into daily life.

5. **Attitude Over Action:**  
   - We can engage with worldly issues (e.g., environmental work, careers) but should do so as “play,” with joy, not from a place of dissatisfaction or obligation.  
   - Example: A psychologist can be happy even if a client doesn’t understand; joy itself is a teaching tool.

6. **Dealing with Difficulty:**  
   - Even pain or aggression from others can be met with a smile and non-aversion. The story of the monk who remained happy even when threatened with death illustrates radical acceptance.  
   - Pain is often about our resistance, not the sensation itself.

7. **Western Buddhism Caution:**  
   - Modern Western Buddhism can become like psychotherapy—transactional and focused on “fixing” people. True Dhamma is about sharing joy freely, not selling solutions.

### **Practical Advice:**
- **Train the mind in seclusion** to build a foundation of contentment.
- **Shift from criticism to nurturing** self-talk.
- **See challenges as “toys” to play with**, not problems to solve.
- **Spread Dhamma through example:** a joyful, smiling presence is the best teaching.

### **Conclusion:**
The path to freedom lies in **releasing the desire to change the world and instead changing our mind**—cultivating happiness and equanimity regardless of circumstances. As Dhammarato concludes: “Stay out of that Dukkha that everybody wants to sell you. Don’t buy it. Keep your cool. Be happy. Practice, practice.”

This talk emphasizes a pragmatic, attitude-based approach to Dhamma practice for laypeople in a complex world.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on your transcript, the speaker uses several vivid metaphors and stories to illustrate the central theme: that true peace comes from fixing our own mind, not the external world.

Here are the key metaphors and stories used:

### **1. The "Draining the Swamp" Metaphor (The Core Story)**
*   **What it is:** A detailed story about a cartoon posted in Washington, D.C. offices. It shows a person waist-deep in a swamp, surrounded by alligators, with the caption: *"when you're up to your hips in alligators it's hard to remember that your original intention was to drain the swamp."*
*   **How it's used:** To illustrate how idealistic people ("bright-eyed, bushy-tailed") go to fix systems (like government) but inevitably become part of the problem ("within a few years, they become one of the alligators"). The speaker extends this to personal crusades in general.

### **2. The "Lifting Weights" / "Gym" Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** The practice of training the mind is compared to building physical strength at the gym.
*   **How it's used:** To argue that one should start small and build mental "muscles" slowly. Instead of tackling the "heavy dudes" (big world problems), start with a "little dumbbell" (a single negative thought, like worry about global warming) and practice changing your attitude toward it. This builds the capacity for happiness through "reps."

### **3. The "Toy" Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** Problems and worldly activities are reframed as "toys."
*   **How it's used:** To encourage a shift from a burdensome, fix-it mindset to one of playful engagement. Instead of *needing* to solve global warming, one can "have fun with it" or "play with it" as a challenge, without the weight of dissatisfaction. This applies to work, music, and relationships.

### **4. The "Atlas" Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** The burden of the world's problems is compared to Atlas carrying the world on his shoulders.
*   **How it's used:** To depict the self-imposed heaviness of taking on global anxieties (e.g., "carrying all the burdens of Italy"). The Dharma practice is presented as the way to "set down the burdens."

### **5. The "Laurel Wreath" / "Dead Flowers" Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** References to ancient Roman laurel wreaths (which wither) and the fleeting nature of cut flowers.
*   **How it's used:** To illustrate the futility of clinging to past achievements or romanticized ideals ("the Golden Age"). They die and decay, yet we carry them like badges, creating dissatisfaction with the present.

### **6. The "Truth vs. Lies" Analogy**
*   **What it is:** A live demonstration with "Corey" about his age.
*   **How it's used:** To show that while reality is singular (one true age), the delusions and complaints we can generate are infinite ("Quite a few" lies can be told). This makes our self-created mental burden (the lies/complaints) enormous compared to the lightweight reality of the present moment.

### **7. Historical & Modern Anecdotes (Mini-Stories)**
*   **Ancient Rome:** Used repeatedly to debunk the myth of a "Golden Age," arguing it was always "messed up," and to show the cyclical rise and fall of civilizations.
*   **The Banker Anāthapiṇḍika:** The story of the lay disciple who managed finances for the Sangha is used to show that deep Dharma practice has always existed within worldly life, not just in monasticism.
*   **The Monk and the Mud Clods:** A reference to a sutta where a monk, questioned by the Buddha, maintains a joyful attitude even in the face of being attacked with mud, stones, arrows, and death. This exemplifies the ultimate goal of unattached happiness.
*   **Teslas & Solar Panels:** Modern examples of how "solutions" (electric cars, renewable energy) come with their own problems (expensive repairs, maintenance), reinforcing the principle of *anicca* (impermanence) and that seeking satisfaction in fixed outcomes leads to disappointment.

### **8. The "City Lifespan" Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** Cities (Rome, New York, Venice) are described as having a life cycle: born, raised, great, and then dying.
*   **How it's used:** To normalize decay and change, and to argue against the notion that the current state of the world is uniquely bad. It's part of a natural cycle.

### **Overarching Metaphorical Framing:**
*   **The Internal vs. External Swamp:** The talk's central pivot is reinterpreting the "swamp." The real swamp isn't Washington, D.C., or the world's problems; **"it's the swamp in the mind that needs to be drained."**
*   **The Internal vs. External Sea Level Rise:** Similarly, "The sea level rise is right here in our mind." The problem is our rising anxiety, not the physical water.

**In summary,** the speaker uses these stories and metaphors to argue that we mistakenly project our internal dissatisfaction onto the external world, engaging in futile "swamp-draining" projects. The true path is to train the mind (like a muscle) to put down burdens (like Atlas), see problems as toys, and find a joyful, playful satisfaction in the present moment, regardless of external conditions.
