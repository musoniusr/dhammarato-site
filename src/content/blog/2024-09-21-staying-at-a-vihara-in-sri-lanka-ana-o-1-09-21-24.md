### Transcript


**Speaker A:** And we'll do that recording.

**Speaker B:** Okay. So I joined a chanting practice yesterday and it was the first time. So I just sat there and listened to the chants.

**Speaker A:** That's the important thing is sit there and listen. All right. They may or may not have a book that has the chanting in it.

**Speaker B:** No, I didn't get one.

**Speaker A:** All right, then you can go online to our Open Sangha Foundation, go to the PDFs, and key the word for chanting, and you will find chanting books there.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** There's one that's really, really a big one that has almost all the chants, and then there's a smaller one from some wat. So go ahead and get both of the chanting books and look at it. The big book, you might— in fact, they normally do the morning chant and the evening chant as kind of a standard. Okay, the morning chant and the evening chant is in that big chanting book. So the way that I would recommend it, rather than printing it out bridging it out is to read over the morning and the evening chants, then go to the chanting, and then come back and read it over again in the book. Okay, back and forth and back and forth, rather than trying to sit there with the book and listen to what they're saying. And that's a bit difficult.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. It's sort of like learning to read music while you're in a band. Yeah, okay, we're not going to try to learn to read music while we're in the band. We're going to work on reading the music outside, and then when the band is playing, we listen very closely. Okay, you'll begin to pick it up because they say the same thing every day. Don't be hard on yourself because every one of those Bhikkhunis had to go through this process Herself.

**Speaker B:** Wow, okay, yes, yes, you're right. And so I should also make an effort to show up for the morning chanting session, because so far I haven't been able to show up that early.

**Speaker A:** Well, don't bother to mumble along with them, but when they do reach a phrase or a line that you know, then you can say that along with them. And then when they start talking or chanting something that you don't know, it's okay to be quiet. It's much more important to listen to what they're saying than it is to try to mimic what they're saying.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah, all right. And good. Also, I'm gonna be staying here at the temple for 15 days. That's what I was told I could stay, but I don't know, do you think it's possible to stay more days? Well, I don't know how that works.

**Speaker A:** The more you fit in, the better that you like the place, the much more likely they'll allow you to stay. They will tell everybody 15 days in the beginning is almost kind of a test.

**Speaker B:** Oh really? Okay.

**Speaker A:** But that 15 days doesn't mean anything to the Bhikkhunis, but it does put you under pressure.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so I inviting you to come right back out of that pressure.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Don'T pressure yourself over 15 days.

**Speaker B:** Okay, that's good. And I also I don't speak Sinhalese.

**Speaker A:** Sinhalese is the language that they're saying.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So, but they're more likely to learn a little English than you are to learn Sinhalese. Yeah. OK, if you're staying there for a long time, then it might be a good idea for you to start learning Sinhalese. The beautiful part of Sinhalese is that it's an Indo-European language. And easier to learn than Thai.

**Speaker B:** Really?

**Speaker A:** Really. Thai is a hard language to learn because of the Japanese, of the Chinese, the tonalities and all of that kind of stuff. But Sinhalese is actually going to be easier for you to learn or pick up.

**Speaker B:** Wow. Okay, I didn't know that. Sounds very difficult to me. Okay, and so when I was coming here from India, they told me, they gave me a visa for Sri Lanka only for 30 days. And I don't know if you know or you have any recommendation if I want to stay longer Regarding the visa.

**Speaker A:** I don't know much of anything about the Sri Lankan visas, but I do know that many years ago when I got Sri Lankan visas, they were for 3 months.

**Speaker B:** Oh really?

**Speaker A:** Okay, but could be extended. So if you are getting along well and you can make it past 15 days to 30 days, then I'm sure that you can get a paper or something from one of the Bhikkhunis that will put a good word in for you. That will make the visa extensions quite easy.

**Speaker B:** Wow, okay, okay, that's good to know. Okay, and, um, um, yeah, I think those were my questions. I didn't have that much questions at all.

**Speaker A:** That's all right, you got— you're just fine. So you continue to practice Anapanasati like we discussed, according to the Four Foundations of Mindfulness and your walking meditation.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Don't get too focused. If you get too focused, then I'm not sure about it. But in Thailand, they have a walking path that's bounded. It's about 20 meters. And when you get to one end, you turn around and walk back. Oh wow, rather than just out walking and walking and walking and walking wherever, they actually have a bounded place that you walk this far, 20 meters, turn around and walk back 20 meters.

**Speaker B:** Wow.

**Speaker A:** Okay, which is 60 feet. That's actually quite a big amount. Yes, fairly long. But if you're too focused, say, on the nose tip, you can miss that boundary. And just keep walking because you're not paying attention. That in fact what we really need to do is to make sure that you're here now, that you're paying attention to what, what's happening with that walking meditation. You're not stepping on any of the— you're not stepping on snakes or Bhikkhunis or anything like that. You're doing it barefoot, so you got to watch where you're going.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that's that. To repeat that. That's the important thing, is to be here in the present moment rather than thinking about Mexico or thinking about the visa or worried about this, that, and the other thing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sounds good. And I also remember I wanted to ask you, because I'm so new to the practices I don't quite understand the difference between Vipassana and Anapanasati.

**Speaker A:** Well, when Vipassana is practiced well, it is Anapanasati. And for sure, when Anapanasati is practiced correctly, it is Vipassana. Okay, now the word Vipassana You can see the word passage or passing in there. And Vipassana is talked about in the sense of insight. The word vi means in or going into, like the word vihara means in the heart, which is the same thing as in the home. So when the Bhikkhuni are in the bhavana, they're in their home. And so the word "vi," Vipassana, actually does not necessarily mean insight in the way that Westerners think of insight. It's not a very good translation. A better way of using the word Vipassana is to look at what you're doing. Watch what's going on. Begin to get some insight into the nature of reality right in this present moment.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** The Vipassana crowd, they make a great big deal out of Vipassana, as if they work and work and work for days, months, and years, and then they'll have an insight. But that insight, if it took that long, it took way too long because they weren't looking at all. And then the worst part of it is, is that once they've had the insight, they think, okay, I'm finished now, rather than taking that insight and applying it over and over again right here in this present moment.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yes. Oh. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** OK, so really Vipassana is— there's not much to it if you're practicing Anapanasati correctly. You're not missing out on something that a whole bunch of people say they're doing, Vipassana, that in fact, more than likely when they're practicing Vipassana, they're not practicing Anapanasati. And that means that they're not practicing the teachings of the Buddha correctly. They're looking for something. They're looking for insight. Rather than looking for this present moment.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. Good to understand that.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Now, one last thing about Vipassana is that, guess what? It's not in the original suttas in the time of the Buddha. The word Vipassana got famous after that.

**Speaker B:** Oh, wow. I didn't know that.

**Speaker A:** There's a big— there's a big controversy in modern Buddhism between Vipassana and Samatha. But in some of the sutras, it says if you have one and not the other, then go get the other one. And if you don't have either one, get them both together at the same time. Okay, now what Samatha means in that case is at rest, at peace, at home, being calm. All right. And the example of that would be imagine that you've got a video camera. Nowadays they have a cell phone. All right. And the example is, is that these guys with their cell phones are video recording an avalanche. And they continue to record the avalanche until they figure out that the avalanche is right on them, it's coming. Okay, and then the cell phone video is all over the place. You can't watch it, they're not going to hold the camera still, they're too busy running.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so Vipassana in reality can only be done when you are calm. Yes, this is why the cameras are often really good cameras, and really good photographers, they'll put the camera on a tripod for stability.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** So think of Samatha as the tripod and think of Vipassana as the camera. And that's why you have to use them together. The tripod's not going to help you, but the camera moving all over the place is not going to help you. You have to have that stable mind in order to see correctly.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. This is very— it's clear. For me, that out.

**Speaker A:** Okay, would you go have fun with your walking meditation? This is why they want you to walk slowly, is because that will help to develop that stability that we're looking for. Slow and easy.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I like it.

**Speaker A:** Then you can see really well.

**Speaker B:** It seems like they're walking on slow camera, like step in lifting the feet and then you don't have to pay.

**Speaker A:** Too much attention to the rocking of the feet and whatnot like that, that if you're too focused on that, you'll wind up moving the foot correctly and then stepping right on a Bhikkhuni. Yeah, so there's more to it than how you lift the foot. I've heard, in fact, that there is 7 that you lift the heel, then your toe, and then you raise it in the air, and then you move it, and then you put the toe down, and then the heel down. And while you're doing that, you just stepped on somebody.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I, I think that could happen.

**Speaker A:** All right, so we're looking for an open awareness that we can focus and see what's real, as opposed to having the mind just all over the place. Because it's possible that you're not watching how you're moving your feet and still step on the Bhikkhuni because you're not watching anything at all. Yeah, that's the normal life that people have. And so by focusing, we wind up having to focus on what's real, including the Satipatthana. You have to look at where you're going, what the body is doing, and we can move back and forth between them. The Buddha talked about it in the sense of one by one as they occur. One by one as they occur. Pay attention to things as they come up.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So as you're about to put that foot down, be sure you know where you're going to put it.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Well, Anna, it's really glad for you to be in Sri Lanka. I'm glad you called.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm glad to talk to you, and I hope I can give you another call soon to let you know how I'm doing.

**Speaker A:** Yes, call me.

**Speaker B:** All right. Have a good day, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Yes, you have a good day.

**Speaker B:** All right. Bye. Thank you.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key advice and discussions between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and a practitioner (Speaker B) who is new to a temple in Sri Lanka:

### **Summary of the Dhamma Talk**

The talk focuses on practical guidance for a newcomer to monastic life, clarifying meditation practice, and dispelling confusion about Buddhist terms.

**1. Practical Temple Advice:**
*   **Chanting:** The practitioner is advised to listen first, not to struggle to follow along. They are encouraged to study the chanting texts (available online) separately and then return to listen, comparing the two—similar to learning sheet music outside of band practice.
*   **Length of Stay:** The initial 15-day permission is described as a common "test." The advice is to relax, fit in, and enjoy the practice; if all goes well, an extension is likely possible with support from the monastics.
*   **Visas & Language:** While not an expert on visas, Dhammarato suggests that a recommendation from the Bhikkhunis (nuns) can help with extensions. He notes that learning Sinhalese is easier than Thai for English speakers, but it's not an immediate necessity.

**2. Core Meditation Instructions:**
*   **Walking Meditation:** The primary instruction is to maintain **present-moment awareness** during walking. One should not become so narrowly focused on the mechanics of the foot (e.g., a strict step-by-step process) that they lose awareness of their surroundings and risk stepping on something or someone. The goal is "open awareness."
*   **Anapanasati (Mindfulness of Breathing):** The practitioner is told to continue this practice according to the **Four Foundations of Mindfulness**, integrating it with walking meditation.

**3. Clarification on Vipassana vs. Anapanasati:**
This is the central Dhamma explanation of the talk. Dhammarato demystifies the often-separated concepts:
*   **They are essentially the same:** When practiced correctly, *Anapanasati* is *Vipassana*, and true *Vipassana* is *Anapanasati*.
*   **Critique of "Vipassana":** He cautions against the modern interpretation where *Vipassana* is seen as a prolonged, effortful search for a future "insight." True insight (*vipassana*) is the clear seeing of reality **in the present moment**.
*   **Samatha & Vipassana are Inseparable:** Using the analogy of a camera and a tripod, he explains:
    *   **Samatha (tranquility/stability)** is the tripod. It represents a calm, steady mind.
    *   **Vipassana (clear seeing/insight)** is the camera.
    *   You need both together. A shaky camera (an agitated mind) cannot see clearly, and a stable tripod alone (calm without insight) doesn't capture the picture. True practice requires a calm mind (*samatha*) to see things as they are (*vipassana*) right now.

**4. Overall Theme:**
The overarching message is to **relax into present-moment awareness**. The practitioner is encouraged to let go of pressure about rules, duration of stay, or complex meditation maps. The path is found in simple, mindful awareness of breathing and walking while being fully attentive to the environment, integrating calm (*samatha*) and insight (*vipassana*) naturally.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the conversation, the primary metaphors and stories are used by **Speaker A (Dhammarato)** to explain meditation concepts and give practical advice. Here are the key ones:

### **1. The Music Metaphor (for learning chanting)**
*   **Metaphor:** Learning to chant by alternating between reading the text and listening to the group is compared to **learning to read music while in a band.**
*   **Explanation:** Speaker A advises against trying to read the chant book while the group is chanting, just as one wouldn't try to learn to read sheet music for the first time during a live performance. The better method is to study separately (practice reading music) and then listen intently during the group session (play in the band).

### **2. The Camera & Tripod Metaphor (for Vipassana and Samatha)**
*   **Metaphor:** The relationship between calmness (*Samatha*) and insight (*Vipassana*) is compared to a **camera and a tripod.**
*   **Story/Example:** This is elaborated with a story of people trying to film an avalanche with a cell phone. When the avalanche gets too close, they panic, run, and the footage becomes shaky and useless.
*   **Explanation:**
    *   **Samatha (calm, stability)** is the **tripod**. It provides the necessary steadiness.
    *   **Vipassana (insight, seeing clearly)** is the **camera**. It is the tool of observation.
    *   The point is that you need a stable, calm mind (the tripod) in order to gain clear insight (get a usable video). Without calm, any attempt at insight will be chaotic and unfocused ("all over the place").

### **3. The Walking Meditation Anecdote (for focus vs. awareness)**
*   **Story:** Speaker A recounts a specific practice from Thailand where walking meditation is done on a **bounded path of about 20 meters**.
*   **Explanation:** This story serves as a cautionary tale about misapplied focus. If you become **too narrowly focused** (e.g., only on the sensations of the nose or the intricate mechanics of lifting a foot), you might **"miss the boundary"** and walk right past it, or even **step on a snake or a Bhikkhuni**. The lesson is that meditation requires **open, present-moment awareness** of your entire environment, not an exclusive focus on one small detail.

### **4. The 15-Day "Test" Metaphor**
*   **Metaphor:** The initial 15-day stay permitted at the temple is framed as a **"test"** or a **period of pressure.**
*   **Explanation:** Speaker A suggests the 15-day limit is not a rigid rule for the nuns but a deliberate device that "puts you under pressure." The advice is to mentally "come right back out of that pressure" and not let the timeframe become a source of anxiety. The metaphor implies that how one handles this initial period is part of the evaluation for a longer stay.

### **5. The "Home" Linguistic Analogy (for Vipassana)**
*   **Analogy/Story:** Speaker A breaks down the Pali word *Vipassana* by relating its prefix *"vi-"* to the word ***"vihara"*** (monastic dwelling).
*   **Explanation:** *"Vi-"* means "in" or "going into." A *vihara* is a "dwelling" or "home" (being *in* the heart/abode). By extension, *Vipassana* is about **"seeing into"** or **"looking closely within"** the present moment, not about achieving a distant, special "insight." This story reframes Vipassana as an intimate, present-moment investigation rather than a grand, future goal.

### **Summary Table of Metaphors & Stories**

| Metaphor/Story | Used to Explain |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Learning music in a band** | How to effectively learn group chanting |
| **Camera on a tripod / Filming an avalanche** | The interdependent relationship between calm (*Samatha*) and insight (*Vipassana*) |
| **Missing the boundary while walking** | The danger of excessive narrow focus vs. open awareness in meditation |
| **The 15-day "test"** | The psychological purpose of the initial stay limit |
| **Etymology of *vihara* and *"vi-"*** | The true, present-moment meaning of *Vipassana* |

These metaphors and stories help translate abstract Buddhist concepts and practices into relatable, everyday experiences for the novice student (**Speaker B**).
