### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So David, you're in, uh, up in the north, and that, uh, pönza is about to be finished. In fact, pönza finishes before the kathen ceremony. Kathen happens immediately after the pönza, uh, or the rains retreat. It's also called vassa. Okay, if you think about it just a little bit, the word pond, panza, gives us the English language word for pond, and vasa or wassa is the same thing as water. And it's the end of the rains retreat in Thailand because Thailand's rain retreat follows the monsoon season in India rather than the Thai So as you're saying that it's now the rainy season in Thailand and yet they're having Vipassana or the Anapanasati, the kathin, now before the rain is finished, I find that so curious that the Thais were so stuck in their Theravada ways that they would not change the calendar according to reality. They had to keep it the calendar according to the time it was in the Buddha. In another place. And that I've seen Abaya Gary change their range retreat to the dead of winter in January, February, and March, which should be exactly the right way to do it, so that the monks actually do a range retreat during the rainy season instead of as soon as the rainy season starts, Vassa is over. So you were asking me where to go after this, and the answer would be, as you could imagine, come on down. But in fact, right now we have Rick, we have Daniel, and we have Katal right here on the island. Well, actually, they, uh, Rick and Daniel are going over to do the Deep of the One retreat starting on the 11th, and then they'll probably be coming back here. And Kathal has been staying at Wat Ruesipha Siangtong, but he wants to move into the Inside Walking Wat and is doing what he needs to do to get in there, and that is that you have to visit the place. Now, you're already fully ordained, or are you a Samadhi?

**Speaker B:** Fully ordained monk.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so all you need to do, because you're, uh, already fully ordained, is just merely ask permission from your Upaya or your Achan. Does the Upaya that you ordained with, is he available to you? He should be.

**Speaker B:** You're his responsibility. Yeah, he's at a different wat. I'm actually not even at a wat. It's like a Samnak. It's not— it's just like a training center for monks. It's not really officially a wat. Yeah, this is why I want to leave. Here after the Katina is just to like go to a real wat and explore that.

**Speaker A:** All right, now the thing of it is, is that because you're already fully ordained, there is a little book that you have called a Wat Paisuti. Do you have such a book?

**Speaker B:** Wat Paisuti?

**Speaker A:** It's a little yellow book the size of a passport. Okay, you should get that. It should have been given to you when you ordained. In fact, it should have been filled out by the Upaya at the end of the ordination ceremony and given to you. And that will be your passport into basically any wat you want to go into.

**Speaker B:** Okay, should get that.

**Speaker A:** All right. And if you don't get that, you still have to get your Upaya's permission to travel. And so it would be wise of you to be able to tell him specifically where you're going.

**Speaker B:** Right. I don't know that specifically yet though.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I think that's probably why you called me. I've actually given the name of the wat, Wat Ruesipha Siangtong. Now once you arrive It would be good. Okay. All right.

**Speaker B:** I've already stayed there one week.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So you can easily move right back in there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And maybe stay a week. Yes. Ajahn Maitri.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. I met him just one day and then he left for travel. So I don't know if he remembers.

**Speaker A:** Me or anything, but he'll be in and out. Guess what? The orange robe will mean something to him, and he might remember you if you mention that you were there before you ordained. Also, because you're fully ordained, you could stay at Wat Khao Tom, which I think would be a really good place. You've got several really, really good options depending upon what you want. Do you want heavy-duty training? No, because you're in a training wat and you want to not be there. Do you want something in the middle? Because that will be what you'll find at both the Insight Walking and also the Wat Ruesi. But if you want loosey-goosey where nobody's saying much of anything to you, not keeping track of you at all, Wat Khao Tom would be the right place to be, right? And from there you can travel around because we've got 2 motorcycles here on the island. You can hop a ride and go all over the place. It's not recommended that you drive yourself on the motorbike. The Thai people don't like the monks doing that, but you can hitch a ride on the back of a motorbike and go most any place that you want. So how are you going to get here? Well, you've already been here, so you know about, uh, Lumphraya and Raja on Khao San Road, spending the night on the bus. Or if you've got some money, you could fly into Surat Thani— I mean, probably with real money, uh, Koh Samui.

**Speaker B:** Right. I'm not that far ahead in the planning yet. I'm just trying to figure out where I'm going.

**Speaker A:** There's a good wat in Udon Thani. There's a good wat in Roy Ett. There's a lot of good wats that I don't know about. Yeah, and you have that Wat Bai Suthe, you would be welcome in every one of them.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, one thing I said here to one of the monks here of 2 years, he said it could be an issue if I get transferred to another Wat that they don't know the Abbot, they don't have a relationship with. Because if I try to transfer to like a Wat, like Wat Khao Tam, they might ask like, well, how was he ordained so quickly? Because I was ordained like— No, they're.

**Speaker A:** Not going to ask you that.

**Speaker B:** Or they might ask like, well, what is his training? What is his practice? Like, what did they teach me?

**Speaker A:** No, they're going to ask you, do you have a Wat Vaisuthi?

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** That'S what they're going to ask.

**Speaker B:** So you don't think it'll be any trouble to go to Wat Khao Tam or anything?

**Speaker A:** None at all, absolutely none. I can think of 5 wats here on the island that you can walk in with no fear of having a problem.

**Speaker B:** Don't the abbots have to, like, communicate with each other?

**Speaker A:** Yes, and that's why you want that Wat Baissuthi. All of that information in that Wat Baissuthi that you can't read, they can.

**Speaker B:** The abbot is a Taywat, the abbot of Wat Khao Tom. What's his name?

**Speaker A:** I don't remember, but I know that he's the nephew of Achan Po, but I don't remember his name. But if you walk in there with words like Achan Po and Deepa Bhavana and you've got a Vajrayana sutra, you got no trouble.

**Speaker B:** Nice. All right. I'll mention that in the coming days here.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's the travel document that they use in Thailand. They also have a travel document that's almost identical to that for Laos.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Now when you get old monk, you don't have to carry the Wat Vaisuthi anymore because you already are well known where you go. So nobody will ask for it. But a Westerner, for sure, just showing up in the robes without old-school behaviors and mannerisms— I mean, anybody can walk into a robe shop and put on a robe and walk into a wat. But that Wat Baisuti, that has the actual Upajaya's name, the date of the ordination, the place where it was done, all of that information.

**Speaker B:** Do you know who is there right now at Wat Khao Tom?

**Speaker A:** The story is, is that the— they're actually— this is not that uncommon in Thailand. That there is property that's not part of the wat but is associated with the wat. For instance, at Wat Khao Tom, there is a meditation retreat center that is right beside it. In fact, the main path walking up from the kitchen to the meditation hall, that path splits the boundary line. Is that— is that integrated? Okay. Now, uh, the— that property known as the Meditation Center has just been sold, uh, to, I understand, some Israelis. And that they have some Burmese, uh, workers there fixing up the place. Now, I know enough about Thailand and whatnot like that, that if these guys wanted to turn that place into a professional— I mean, a commercial place— they couldn't do it. It wouldn't have been sold to them. The AMPo wouldn't like it. The only thing that that property can be used for is a meditation retreat center, and that you have to pass through the meditation retreat center to get to the wat, right? Unless you know the back door, which is a dirt road or dirt path that you have to climb a steep hill with. So let's not talk about the back door. Let's talk about the only entrance into the wat is through the meditation retreat center. So 99%, surely, positively, that place will be used as a retreat center. And I think that that's a really good thing.

**Speaker B:** But that retreat center, I heard, is not like specifically Buddhist. They want to turn it in, uh, that they're building there at Wat Khao Tam. They're rebuilding the retreat center, right?

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** And the one that they're rebuilding is not specifically Buddhist.

**Speaker A:** What do you mean by that? Of course it's specifically Buddhist. It's specifically Buddhist with a Buddhist temple. It's specifically Buddhist with all of the people who will go. I mean, all of the teachers who have ever been there, like Prajna Root, who was a Buddhist monk, or Anthony Markwell was teaching there. Right now, and what you're saying is, is that whatever teacher that comes that the Israelis are choosing to have as a meditation teacher, she not— she may not be specific to in her own mind, Buddhist.

**Speaker B:** Right. I was there when they were discussing the Israeli Guy was discussing this with Tukita. It sounded like he. He had in mind some kind of eclectic tradition retreat center, like yoga.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Hinduism, but it wouldn't be Islamic or Christian in the sense of no Buddhist allowed.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** It is mostly going to be Buddhist because that's the community that they're in and it has the monks there. So it's obvious to anybody who walks in there that it's got Buddhist flavor. I wouldn't say that that's an issue at all. It's something that's an interesting point of conversation, but it certainly should not be part of your decision-making process?

**Speaker B:** No, it's interesting. We'll see how it turns out, I guess.

**Speaker A:** And being a monk, you're more than likely going to stay on the Wat property rather than at the retreat center property, to where the other guys that I've just mentioned— Kat and Daniel and Rick— they could have a choice, either one, I think. That they would probably be possibly located in the retreat center because there's a whole lot more accommodations in the retreat center than there is in the wat.

**Speaker B:** Although if you stay in the retreat center, Tukata charges like 500 baht a day.

**Speaker A:** Tukata is out of the picture completely.

**Speaker B:** Oh, currently. She's not currently.

**Speaker A:** She has not been since the time that you were talking to her, which was months ago. And now that she does no longer own or have any say-so about the property, she's got no say-so at all, and she knows that.

**Speaker B:** So people are just staying at the retreat center for free now?

**Speaker A:** Uh, let us say that the retreat center has been empty for so long that that there are nobody right now staying at the retreat center and haven't been since COVID The Wat Khao Tam has never recovered from COVID.

**Speaker B:** When I was there, I was there a few months ago, like in April, and yeah, there's a few foreigners staying there. There was still retreats going on. Tokata was there and like she was charging money to stay in her retreat center. I stayed there a few nights There's some other foreigners staying there.

**Speaker A:** Okay, but now that I hear that the property has been sold, she doesn't have any say-so anymore. It'll be the whoever, the people who bought it that were going under our current label of Israeli, because that's all we know about them. So you've got a lot of options, and Wat Khao Tom is one on the top of the list.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you'd be most welcome down here. You've got a lot of options down here. Most every place else that you want to go to, you will not have any already made friends.

**Speaker B:** Right. Yeah, I would like to go and go try it. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Okay, well, you're welcome. I would really like it if you were here on the island.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it'd be fun. One thing I want to share, one story that happened about a month ago. I told you we went, our temple here, or like training center, we all the monks here went to Bangkok, or to the main temple, Wat Damakai. We went for 5 days and then we came back. And on our way back, on our way back to the training center, we stopped at a wat called Wat Tham Khao Wong near Khao, about 2 hours outside of Bangkok. And it has a huge cave, like a huge cave, like an amazing cave. Apparently someone in the past was killed over this cave because someone else wanted it for themselves. And there's the Ajahn there. He's been a monk for 35 years. And he's supposed to be like this meditation master. He spends 3 nights a week in meditation. He doesn't sleep 3 nights a week. He just meditates. In the cave.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And, uh, as we were leaving, like, he only speaks Thai, and he was talking to, like, my mentor, my mentor monk. And as we were all leaving, there's like 9 of us, he says, uh, he says in Thai, take good, good care of the foreigners, especially this guy, and he points to me. And I'm like, that's kind of weird though, don't you think? Like, why is he saying— I never said anything. No one, none of the foreigner monks said anything to this guy. We just stood there. But he's saying, take good care of me.

**Speaker A:** Okay. All right. Made you feel good, huh?

**Speaker B:** No, it made me feel Like, what is this about?

**Speaker A:** Like, maybe it made you full of trepidation and fear and, um, uh, doubt about why me, etc., huh? Well, you had the option to feel the way that you wanted to feel. Why would you choose to feel that way when you could have chosen to feel, hey, I feel accepted and warm fuzzy?

**Speaker B:** I just thought that was interesting.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but it's typical.

**Speaker B:** But it's weird because none of us ever said anything to him. We just stood there. So why is he saying— why is he pointing at me?

**Speaker A:** Well, why are you asking why? Why are you asking why?

**Speaker B:** It's a good question, I think.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it is a good question. Uh-huh. Why are you bothered with that?

**Speaker B:** It's like, just accept that he's got.

**Speaker A:** Eyes and he can see. He's got senses and he sensed something nice in you and he mentioned it. No big deal.

**Speaker B:** I think, yeah, it's like if you meditate like that, if you're a monk for 35 years, I think maybe you can see something.

**Speaker A:** Well, anybody who looks can see that.

**Speaker B:** People, I think, yeah.

**Speaker A:** But all you're doing is you're indicating that he, he can look and see. Most people in the West can't look, they can't see, they don't know. But with skill, you can look and see. By the way, going back to a point, you use the word mentor.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, mentor monks, we call them.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, okay. A better word for him is that he is your acharya. Arya, in a way, that's what the word acharya means. It's better, more mentor than it is, you know, sitting on the throne teacher. All right. He obviously knows the Upajaya personally.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they're both in the Dhammakaya tradition.

**Speaker A:** Well, that doesn't mean much anymore. A monk is a monk. That's like saying, well, Baptist and Presbyterians.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, he probably does know my Upaya.

**Speaker A:** Well, by the way that things are done, he should. Now here's an actual important question. Was this mentor monk that you're talking to, was he at your ordination? Or better still, an easier question, would be, did he take part in your ordination? Did he participate in any way in your ordination? That should be an easy question.

**Speaker B:** Yes, my mentor monk took part in my ordination.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so it's okay to call him your Achan.

**Speaker B:** I guess. Yeah, teacher.

**Speaker A:** Right, so you need to talk to him right, about talking to the Upaya about getting your Wat Vajrayana or Wat Vesuti, your monk's ID. And so that's the, that's the path that I would take if I were you, is to ask him about that document.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so it's called Wat Bai Suti.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, something like that. It's either Wat Bai Suti or Wat Bachaichon, but I think the Wat Bachaichon is actually ordinary people's ID and the Wat Bai Suti is the monk's ID. Okay, and it looks like a passport. I don't think it's got photos in it. But it is a yellow book, and on the front of it will have a Dhamma Chaka.

**Speaker B:** Okay. All right, that's good. I'll, in the few— in the coming days, I'll mention that to my Ajahn. That I want to move. Yeah, I've told some monks here already that I'm probably gonna move, and now I want to.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, you can actually tell him that you have some time here in the south of Thailand, that you already have friends here, that you know the, the wats here, that you've got a specific wat to come to with other what's possible. So make a very, very positive presentation rather than, I want out of here. That's not the right— the right way to do it is you've got someplace to go.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** And it's easy to remember Ajahn Maitri.

**Speaker B:** Right. I don't think I want to go to Wat Phra Sangtam though, because I feel like there's so much chanting they do there.

**Speaker A:** Well, maybe one or two days. I mean, even if you tell them where you are that you're going there, that doesn't mean that you have to stay there.

**Speaker B:** Oh, so I just go there for a few days and then say, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Just go in and check in and then go wherever the other guys are. But I mean, we're still kind of up in the air right now about, uh, uh, what's going to be happening at Wat Khao Tam. It's not settled yet what's happening. In fact, uh, uh, as I said, Katha really wants to go to stay at the wat that's next to the Insight Walking Meditation Center. But there are other— there are other wats on the island too, but right now we've got 3. Uh, Matuan— Wat Matuan is kind of full right now, and that everybody recommends to not go to Wat, uh, uh, see to new, because that's kind of a training center like you want to get out of. So the least amount of effort and the least amount of responsibility and the least amount of difficulty getting in, all of those come under wat khao tom.

**Speaker B:** Or Wat Vassangtam, because I've met the abbot at— that one's easy too, except.

**Speaker A:** That that one doesn't— that one's got more structure that you're kind of wanting to get out of.

**Speaker B:** But I never met the abbot at Wat Khao Tam. I don't think he was present when I was.

**Speaker A:** He's not there a lot.

**Speaker B:** He's not there a lot.

**Speaker A:** As I have mentioned several times, the problem is, is that to go on Bhandabhat is quite a hike down the mountain. And so the monks, unless there's someone to, to, uh, to drive them back and forth to Bhandabhat They don't want to stay at White Cow Town unless it's got its own kitchen open, which it did for years. There was a Meiji who stayed there, and I don't think she's there anymore. If she was there, you would have known it when Dukkha was there.

**Speaker B:** An.

**Speaker A:** Old fat woman dressed in white, a Meiji. Living right there at the kitchen. Nope, nope, she's gone. Probably during COVID time she left.

**Speaker B:** And.

**Speaker A:** So they don't have a cook. And then there is Indira, but I recommend that you don't go there because you're a monk. That's a meditation retreat center. Arya. There's also the possibility of staying at the wat this next— they're building actually now a wat next to Deepavuwan Meditation Center. So there's 3 places that we know of that have a wat beside a meditation retreat center. Deepavuwan, Wat Khao Tom, where you are, and Insight Walking all have 2 different properties side by side. And so you've got many opportunities down here.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that sounds good.

**Speaker A:** So when are you planning on moving? The Vajrayana sutra should not take that long. Yeah, it's not yet, so we're talking about what, December?

**Speaker B:** I know we're doing the Khatin ceremony next week, and then after that I'm free. If I want to leave, I can suggest to my Anagami that I want to do that.

**Speaker A:** You need to tell him before. You need to go to Vajrayana right away. Okay, today, tomorrow.

**Speaker B:** Okay, do you think I— because, uh, do you think I have an easier chance going to Wat Phra Sangtam first or Wat Khao Tam?

**Speaker A:** Uh, I'm not sure about Wat Khao Tam yet. I know that the door is open, at least cracked open, but I do know that Wat Ruesi Pasianthong, the door is for you is wide open.

**Speaker B:** And if I go there and I don't necessarily want to stay there, is it easy for me to change?

**Speaker A:** Easy enough. Easy enough.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Once you get out from under the thumb of your mentor and your Upaya, you only need to check in with them occasionally.

**Speaker B:** And you don't think it'll be a problem going there because I ordained in.

**Speaker A:** My— you— all of the problems are in your mind. Don't give those problems to other people for their minds too.

**Speaker B:** Because I was talking to one monk here of 2 years, he said another foreigner monk wanted to go to a different temple like myself, and it was a problem for him because the temple he wanted to go to asked him a bunch of questions like, well, what's his training, or how long has he been ordained for, or how did he get ordained so quickly? Because normally in Thailand you have to.

**Speaker A:** Take— but all of it, you were not there. You do not know what happened in that meeting with those questions. All you know is the stories that possibly had feelings wrapped up with them, that he felt afraid because he was being interrogated, and he possibly— you don't even know whether he showed up with his Wat Pachaitan are not. So they questioned him because he may have not thought— or not known that he didn't have the right documentation to answer all of those questions. Also, it's changing. Things are changing in Thailand. That when I became a monk, it was easy enough, but in that process, during those years, they were really cracking down because Westerners don't make good monks just walking in off the street. And so they proposed that you become a Samanin for a year. That in fact, Kamasitu was Samanin for a year. All right, and you fully ordained? Well, Eric fully ordained, but he's under the thumb of Achan Santi in Royette, but he's actually in Laos. And so Ajahn Santi probably organized him going into Laos. I haven't even talked to Eric about that. But in any case, an interrogation is no big deal, unless you're afraid of the interrogation. And since you've already met Ajahn Maitri, it's not likely that he's going to be doing a whole lot of interrogation.

**Speaker B:** He might not remember me really, because—.

**Speaker A:** Right, but even if he doesn't, him— you reminding him that you've been there before will answer a whole lot of his possibly questions that you're thinking about when you heard this story. That more than likely, even though they interrogated him, they didn't kick him out and tell him, tell him you can't stay here. They were just wanting to know. I've been interrogated before too. Okay, but in fact, a lot of it has to do with how you handle the interrogation. If you think there's nothing to the interrogation, and there's nothing to it. If you get all afraid and can't answer their questions and start acting like Donald Trump on the witness stand Then, then you're making it a big deal and giving it as a big deal back to the monks who are asking you the questions. Now, getting back to the story, that what happened was, is that for many, many years they required a year of Samanen. This was done out of the Bureau of Religious Council, which is actually a government organization run by a group of monks. But it also has a bureaucracy of paperwork that's run by laypeople. All right. And so it was well-known knowledge for 30 years or more that we don't want to ordain Westerners, that we want them to go through a program first. But since COVID has happened and other things, that whole point has been relaxed. The rules have changed. And so that story that you're telling may either be an old story or it may be a new story with old monks who hadn't heard that times have loosened up. And again, it all has to do with your relationship with Upaya and that document, that if you've got that Upaya's document, you've got his signature That's your key into the door, as more so than the robes itself. Yeah, it's really not as hard as you think it is. Okay, and don't mind the difference, and don't even bother to tell people the difference. In fact, don't say the word Dhammakaya, don't say the word Dhammayu. Don't say the word Mahanakaya.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it shouldn't matter.

**Speaker A:** Doesn't matter, but until you make it matter.

**Speaker B:** I feel like some monks here think it does.

**Speaker A:** Some monks, it does matter.

**Speaker B:** Even some senior monks, I think it may matter.

**Speaker A:** Well, for some senior monks, that's because they were junior monks that didn't get over it over time. But don't make problems that don't really exist. It's not a problem for you, then it's not going to be a problem for them. But if you make it a problem for you, then you're going to give them your problem. Yeah, and now you've got a problem with them. Yeah, you're sharing a mutually shared problem that really doesn't exist.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I agree. It's not a problem. Okay, well, that's good. It's easy enough, you say, so I'm happy. Yeah, I will look into coming to the island.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, keep me in touch. Let me know when you're coming. I'll have some new data by the time you're ready to come.

**Speaker B:** Nice. You said Daniel and Kat, and who else are there?

**Speaker A:** And Rick. Rick's gone back to Koh Samui because he's getting ready to do the retreat, which starts in a couple of days. And Daniel's got a hot footed over there, but he's been sick. They're— by the way, they're both here at the house right now. Daniel, Come say hi to David. He's dressed in that Halloween costume.

**Speaker B:** The Halloween— the orange man.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, I've seen David in that.

**Speaker B:** Costume because I visited him in iMonastery. Uh-huh.

**Speaker A:** Remember that, David? Oh, he's shy. He turned his camera off.

**Speaker B:** I'm trying to— yeah, I'm still here. Yeah. I'm free to leave. I'm free to leave now, so I'm thinking about going to the island.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, come on down. We got plenty of room for you.

**Speaker B:** Excellent. Yeah, yeah, be fun. Okay. I see you.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, let's finish now and we'll see you.

**Speaker B:** Keep, keep in touch.

**Speaker A:** All righty.

**Speaker B:** Okay, thank you so much, Dhammarato. I'll keep in touch with you. Okay, take care. All the best.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** Have fun.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk is a practical and advisory conversation between **Dhammarato (Speaker A)** and a **newly fully ordained Western monk named David (Speaker B)** who is currently at a training center in northern Thailand.

### **Summary of Key Points:**

1.  **Context & Timing:** The discussion occurs near the end of the Buddhist Rains Retreat (*vassa* or *pānṣa*). David is planning his next steps after the upcoming *Kathin* ceremony.

2.  **Primary Advice: The Monk's "Passport":** Dhammarato's central and repeated guidance is for David to obtain his official monk's identification booklet, called a **"Wat Paisuti" or "Wat Bai Suti."** This yellow, passport-like document, issued by his preceptor (*Upajjhāya*), is crucial for seamlessly transferring to other monasteries (*wats*). Without it, he will face more questions and potential difficulties.

3.  **Destination Options:** Dhammarato encourages David to come to Koh Samui, where several friendly Western practitioners are staying. He reviews potential *wats*:
    *   **Wat Ruesipha Siangtong:** An easy initial option where David has stayed before. The abbot, Ajahn Maitri, is familiar with Western monks.
    *   **Wat Khao Tom:** Presented as a "loosey-goosey" option with less structure, ideal for independent practice and easy travel around the island. Dhammarato reassures David that having the proper document will prevent issues about his quick ordination or training background.
    *   **Other Centers:** Mentions Insight Walking Meditation Center and Deepa Bhavana, noting they often have adjacent *wat* properties for monks.

4.  **Navigating the System:** The talk provides a "how-to" for a monk transferring monasteries:
    *   Speak respectfully to your current teacher (*Acharya*) and preceptor.
    *   Frame the move positively (e.g., "I have a community and a specific place to go") rather than as an escape.
    *   Use the *Wat Paisuti* to answer administrative questions.
    *   Avoid creating problems by emphasizing sectarian differences (e.g., Dhammakaya tradition); a monk is a monk.

5.  **A Dhamma Lesson Within Logistics:** David shares an anecdote about an old cave-dwelling meditation master who singled him out for special care. Dhammarato uses this to offer a brief Dhamma teaching: **David had a choice in how to interpret that event**—with doubt and fear, or with acceptance and warmth. The lesson is to observe one's own mind's tendency to create uncertainty.

6.  **Practical Logistics:** They discuss travel to the island (overnight bus, flight) and the changing situation at Wat Khao Tom, where an adjacent retreat center has been sold to new owners (likely Israelis), but its use will likely remain meditation-focused.

### **Overall Tone & Purpose:**
The talk is a mix of **mentorship, logistical coaching, and reassurance.** Dhammarato acts as a knowledgeable guide, demystifying the Thai monastic system for a new Western monk. He alleviates David's anxieties about transferring monasteries, emphasizing that with the correct document and a confident, problem-free attitude, the path forward is open and welcoming. The underlying theme is to handle practical affairs with mindfulness, without letting the mind create unnecessary obstacles.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the conversation, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **"Passport" / "Travel document"**: Speaker A repeatedly refers to the monk's identification book (*Wat Paisuti*) as a "passport." This metaphor emphasizes its function as essential, official paperwork that grants access and permission to travel between monasteries (wats).
    *   *Example*: "And that will be your passport into basically any wat you want to go into."

2.  **"Under the thumb"**: This metaphor describes being under the strict control or authority of one's teacher (Upajaya or Achan). It conveys a sense of restriction that the speaker (B) wishes to move away from.
    *   *Example*: "Once you get out from under the thumb of your mentor and your Upaya..."

3.  **"Loosey-goosey"**: A colloquial metaphor used to describe a wat with a very relaxed, unstructured, and informal atmosphere with little oversight.
    *   *Example*: "But if you want loosey-goosey where nobody's saying much of anything to you... Wat Khao Tom would be the right place."

4.  **"Door is open / cracked open / wide open"**: This is a metaphor for the ease or difficulty of entering a wat. An "open door" signifies a welcoming, easy entry, while a "cracked" door suggests some uncertainty or conditions.
    *   *Example*: "I know that the door is open, at least cracked open... but I do know that Wat Ruesi... the door is for you is wide open."

5.  **"Halloween costume"**: A humorous and slightly irreverent metaphor for the monk's orange robes, used when a third person (Daniel) appears on camera wearing them.
    *   *Example*: "He's dressed in that Halloween costume... The orange man."

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Story of the Calendar and Vassa**: Speaker A tells a brief historical/cultural story about how Thailand's "rains retreat" (*vassa*) follows the ancient Indian monsoon calendar rather than the actual Thai rainy season. He uses this to illustrate how traditions can become rigidly stuck in the past ("so stuck in their Theravada ways").
    *   *Purpose*: To highlight a curiosity of Buddhist practice in Thailand and to contrast it with more adaptable approaches.

2.  **The Sale of the Wat Khao Tom Retreat Center**: This is an extended, unresolved story about change and uncertainty. Speaker A recounts how the meditation center next to Wat Khao Tom was sold to Israeli buyers, creating speculation about its future use (eclectic vs. Buddhist). The story serves as a practical consideration for Speaker B's plans.
    *   *Purpose*: To give context about a potential destination, illustrating the fluid and sometimes commercially influenced reality of some meditation centers in Thailand.

3.  **The Cave Monk's Prophecy**: Speaker B shares a personal, mysterious story about visiting a cave-dwelling meditation master. The monk, without any prior interaction, pointed at Speaker B and told the group to "take good care of the foreigners, especially this guy." This story carries an almost folkloric or mystical quality.
    *   *Purpose*: It reveals Speaker B's introspection and search for meaning. Speaker A's response reframes it as a lesson in perception and choosing one's emotional response ("you could have chosen to feel, hey, I feel accepted and warm fuzzy").

4.  **The Story of the Interrogated Monk**: Speaker B recounts a second-hand story about another foreign monk who faced difficult questions when trying to transfer to a new wat. This story represents Speaker B's **fear and anxiety** about the process.
    *   *Purpose*: Speaker A deconstructs this "story," arguing it may be outdated, misinterpreted, or dependent on the monk's own demeanor. He uses it to teach Speaker B not to borrow problems from others ("all of the problems are in your mind").

5.  **The Evolving Rules for Ordaining Westerners**: Speaker A provides a broader narrative about changing institutional policies in Thailand—from requiring a year as a novice (*samanen*) to a more relaxed post-COVID approach. This is a "story" of bureaucratic and cultural shifts.
    *   *Purpose*: To reassure Speaker B that the landscape has changed and his quick ordination may not be an issue, especially if he has the proper "passport" (the *Wat Paisuti*).

**Overall Theme**: The metaphors and stories collectively paint a picture of a journey—both physical (traveling between monasteries) and internal (managing doubt and perception). They highlight the tension between **institutional structure** (passports, rules, thumbs) and **personal freedom** (open doors, loosey-goosey places), while the anecdotes offer lessons in navigating this spiritual landscape with practicality and a calm mind.
