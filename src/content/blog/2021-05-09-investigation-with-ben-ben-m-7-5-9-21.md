### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Oh good, it's been— Ben, it's good to see you again. Been a while to see you.

**Speaker B:** Yes, good to see you too.

**Speaker A:** You've been on travels to Manchester and whatnot.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Uh, you brought up also a question that was phrased something in the sense that often you have music or old songs that will come to mind and that you begin to put together that if you start to control your breathing and put the gaps in the breathing, that actually the music will stop also. And I wanted to take a point to congratulate you for that, because that's good knowledge for you to use eventually when you're ready for it.

**Speaker B:** Okay, that's good to hear. Very good to hear.

**Speaker A:** Yes. And so let's look at the foundation of that. And so the first thing that we should look at then is to understand that the mind is very, very much like a ship. Or a boat in the sense that the ship has rudder but it doesn't have brakes,

**Speaker B:** right?

**Speaker A:** Big ships don't have brakes, which means that the captain of the ship or whoever is steering the ship has to look out in advance to make sure that things are clear, right? And if there's not, then he has to be ready in advance to do something about it. So as to steer the boat, for instance, to keep it from crashing into the harbor, you want it to gently be placed in its berth rather than for it to crash in at 3 or 4 knots.

**Speaker B:** That wouldn't be good. That would be quite disastrous.

**Speaker A:** Even at walking speed, if you walk a big ship into a port at walking speed, you're going to do tens of thousands of dollars of damage. And so, in that way, we have to start watching this. Now, the analogy is that even a rowboat doesn't have brakes.

**Speaker B:** Very true.

**Speaker A:** And the human mind also doesn't have brakes. In a way, you wouldn't even want many of the functions of the mind to have brakes, because putting the brakes on is the same thing as death, in the sense of putting the brakes to the part of the brain that does the heartbeat.

**Speaker B:** That does the breathing, that does the heartbeat.

**Speaker A:** Right, the breathing and the heartbeat happens mostly automatically, and you want those functions to keep going. The same thing is true about the part of the brain that we would refer to then as the conscious— uh, not conscious, let's call it the verbal dialogue or the talking mind. Because the Western society has mostly gotten into— let us say the primary mode of operation is either hearing or seeing, and that's why we have television. Television seems to satisfy us because it has the two primary things of seeing and listening. But visualizations normally come in the sense of flash images that will flash in the brain that last only one mind moment.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Where constructed thoughts that have dialogue to them will take a number of mind moments to put those things together. All right. For that reason, the number of mind moments spent in discursive thought is fairly high. We spend more time in talking to ourselves than we spend in any other kind of mind moment. And we want to make some changes to that. But the number one thing we have to understand is the change that we're not intending to make is the intention to stop it. Yeah, that's not our intention. No, our intention is to guide it.

**Speaker B:** You don't want to try and force— forcing the stop will just make the noise louder, make it more abundant.

**Speaker A:** The switching of the brakes before the crash is not useful.

**Speaker B:** Very true. Very true. Yeah, you don't want to try and force something like that at all, exacerbate. Whatever it is that you're experiencing.

**Speaker A:** This is where we have then those concepts of changing the mind from the critical mind into the nurturing mind. Let's not head off into the high seas of the ups and downs of every different decision that we can make and find the safe harbor where things are really easy. And so we can use so many different analogies. The analogy that feels really good for me, partly because of the psychotherapy, is the analogy of the critical mind versus the nurturing mind, or the critical parent versus the nurturing parent. But the Buddha focuses on the quality of calling it the distinction between unwholesome thoughts and wholesome thoughts. Well, we're talking about the same thing. And the Buddha also talks about the unwholesome thoughts in the sense of being hindrances to the mind being in a wholesome state.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** So this is the whole place now that we've got to go with, is that above all else, no matter what object of meditation we take or what we call is meditation, or no matter who what teacher teaches it, there's this number one job that needs to be done that is so obvious and so simple that people just miss it completely. It's almost like the saying that if you want to learn to play the piano, you've got to learn a few chords and scales. If you don't learn the chords and the scales, you're not going to be able to play music, and you're not going to learn new music fast. Because all the music that you ever played was going to be some adaptation to either an appreggio, which is a scale with strength notes in it, but the whole point about going up and down the keyboard is what we've got to do, either in groups or in quick fingering. So this is also the same thing as we need to develop those skills of the mind in order to put the mind to work.

**Speaker B:** Fundamental.

**Speaker A:** It's got to be fit for work. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa is really big on this. In fact, I didn't quite understand what he meant for a long time about when the mind is fit for work, and he equates that with the mind is fit for work is when there is wisdom at the point of contact. Now we'll discuss what that means over time.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** But in reality, we're talking about a particular place in the sequence of events in the mind where whatever it was that we were either thinking or looking at, we have now fully processed it in the processing that is called perception and come up with an internal understanding of that which we see.

**Speaker B:** Right, right.

**Speaker A:** That is what contacts us. Reality does not contact the human mind; the human mind's construction is what contacts the human mind. Interesting, huh?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, very. That's a very, very interesting take. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well, you can see it when you recognize that the mind works in a particular way. That we, in order to perceive something or to understand it or to cognize it— cognize it, cognition, cognition. Uh, and in fact, the right way of thinking about it correctly is recognition. Recognition. What does recognition mean? It means that we have seen it before and we've stored it away in memory And now when we're perceiving it, when we become conscious of it and perceive it, we add the old stuff to it so that we now recognize this as Sister Susie or the dog that we know or whatever like that, because it's all based upon the past. And then that is the newly constructed item of the mind. That newly constructed item of the mind now is like the five senses, because you cannot think outside of the five senses. You can think in the sense of touch, taste, smell, seeing, and hearing, and then thinking. But all of those things have to do with your thinking thoughts of words you've heard. You're having visual images because you have been able to see in the past. People who were completely blind from birth don't see in visual images. Their spatial contact has to do with touch.

**Speaker B:** That's— yeah, that— I mean, obviously I'm not blind, so I can't imagine that.

**Speaker A:** But it's exactly with the way that people play the piano when they're good at it. Very beginners look at the keyboard.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Intermediate musicians look at the sheet music. Professionals look at the audience.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's impressive. It's impressive. I, I myself play the drums, and,

**Speaker A:** and you know, at one time you used to look at the drums.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I used to look at the drums, and it's just like, oh, and

**Speaker A:** now you don't look at the drums anymore.

**Speaker B:** Exactly, exactly.

**Speaker A:** Why that's true is because you convinced yourself that you know where each drum is. You set the drum set up in a certain way, and there they are, just like the keyboard keyboard on a computer and people learn to touch type.

**Speaker B:** The touch type. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Then they don't have— and then they don't have to look at the keyboard anymore until they get a new keyboard that's a slightly different arrangement or in a slightly like, um, slightly longer. Big computers have big keyboards and your fingers have to adjust to the distance of the keys.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But we still do it tactically rather than visually. But in the beginning, we do things visually. But once we see it, now things click visually very fast. Okay, but when we think logically, or putting things in a row, or building a concept, that's language that we use to do that. And that takes a much longer period of time. So guess what? That means that we spend a whole lot more time talking to ourselves than we do painting pictures for ourselves. Because of the nature, the way that the mind works. Okay, so what we're getting at now is, is that this verbal thought has gotten to be a major habit. Yes, because we spent so much time talking to ourselves trying to figure things out. Okay, and so in this regard, in the Paticcasamuppada, we begin to understand that things are at two levels. We hear, we see at two levels. One is that we see what the eye sees, and then we see it internally in the sense of understanding. And we can use the same word, oh, I see what you mean, and we're not looking with the eyes at all.

**Speaker B:** Your understanding.

**Speaker A:** We're doing an understanding that's based upon conceptualizations that may or may not have visual images in there. Yeah, but oftentimes we can see things with a visual image and get it. Yes, it's like they say, a picture is worth a thousand words, and that's conservative.

**Speaker B:** That, yeah, that, that makes a lot of sense. That's that saying, that use of that saying. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So now that we know how important this verbal talking is, we can begin to investigate it a little bit, because mostly what we tell ourselves, how we talk to ourselves, is the way that our parents talk to us when we were kids, right? Not when we were tiny kids, not when we were infants being carried around. That's Gucci Gucci stage. No, we didn't spend much time in Gucci Gucci.

**Speaker B:** No, we did not.

**Speaker A:** We started about the age of 5 or 6 into you got to grow up, you got to be older than you are. Kids that are 6 and 7 always add time to their age. They want to be older so that they could be more grown up and get the benefits of being grown up, not recognizing that the benefits of being grown up are very meager compared to the number of orders that you've got to follow in order to be grown up in that world.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** And so what that means then is most of the talking that we do to ourselves is talking about what should be done, how things ought to be, comparison— this is good, this is better, I like that even better than that— and we get into a judgmental way of thinking.

**Speaker B:** Judgmental.

**Speaker A:** Now, that judgmental way of thinking, in fact, built our society. And people, some people will say, wow, isn't that wonderful? We've got a society here. And other people will scratch their chin and say, and that's how this, all this crap came to be.

**Speaker B:** It's very true. Very, very true.

**Speaker A:** This hubble wasn't good enough. I wanted a bigger hubble. And when I make my hubble big enough, I could put the word Trump Tower at the top of it.

**Speaker B:** The Trump Tower.

**Speaker A:** That's how we think. We think in names and images and big deals and things like this as part of that critical thinking.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Which boils down to basically, I like this and I don't like that. And when we like this and we don't like that, What is the this and the that are not the actual realities? The this and the that, so what we made of it, our own concoction becomes the this or the that that I don't like.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And if the what— what this concoction is that is— that I liked or I didn't like was actually used information from the past. So the likelihood is, is that if this reminded me in any way of something that I didn't like in the past, that's going to get part of the mix, and I'm going to automatically program myself to not like this thing that's impacting me. When we begin to recognize these kind of influences that we have on ourselves, this would then be called the wisdom at that point of contact. When we bring this stuff up, when we say, look where this came from, this is a bunch of crap, and I don't have to feel bad Because I can see through it now. I can see that this stuff was concocted in the brain under duress in a way. And the duress was the duress of the past. And so, an example of that is that if you're in one political party, when you hear the name of a person at the top of the other political party, we automatically don't like him because of all— we can't take Donald Trump as a brand new Donald Trump today. We've got to see it the way that he was back in the 1990s, or how bad he screwed up 10 years ago, or how bad he screwed up last year, or whatever like that. Always in the past and never being able to see things like they are in the present moment. That's why the hatred is so strong against him, is because of people living in the past. If they would hear what Donald Trump has to say right now without figuring all that other stuff fit, uh, uh, figuring all of that stuff into it. He's quite a comedian.

**Speaker B:** He is an entertaining gentleman.

**Speaker A:** He is an entertainer. And if you allow him that point, you can give him what he's due. He's due the fact that he's a really excellent entertainer. Never mind the past. We have to take it at base value. Okay, so guess what? Well, you and me from time to time put ourselves in that position of being the Donald Trump in our life, in the sense that we can't take ourselves and accept ourselves the way we are right now. We've got to go add past crap to it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, think of things from the past, think of things that you are not

**Speaker A:** happy with, and then we're not happy now.

**Speaker B:** Then you're not happy now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You slap past grievances on the present, and then you're living in the unhelpful, unpleasant, unwholesome emotions of the past in the present.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so now that we're beginning to understand this teaching of the Buddha of Paticcasamuppada We begin to recognize how important this point is, at that point of contact, to be aware, to be mindful at that point. Why? Because that's the point when we can make a decision over, is this stuff I just made up a bunch of crap or what? And when we can see that this is a bunch of crap, that I've just manufactured out of my own pile of shit, out of my own dirtbag, then I can say that's unwholesome and

**Speaker B:** we can throw that Anagami out of here.

**Speaker A:** Get out of here! Out you go! This is the crap that we keep coming up with that keeps us unhappy and miserable, that we keep repeating the errors of the past and we don't learn anything from them. We need to be able to learn something from a past event, and this say fine, that's not who I am anymore. I'm something brand new now. Let the old go. Let the dead bury the dead, literally. Yeah, okay, we don't even have to plant corpses or anything because we don't expect new corpse flowers anyhow. Yeah, so this is the rationale now

**Speaker B:** behind

**Speaker A:** This whole idea that the Buddha had that he was so strong about, about removing the hindrances from the mind. We have to get the mind in a really wholesome state because the unwholesome states will ignorantly take us into Dukkha. And so we wake up to this point. This is the wisdom. This is the investigation of one's right view is to reference, is this thought wholesome? Or what?

**Speaker B:** Is this wholesome?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Well, then you can stay around. Is this wholesome? No. Then get out of here.

**Speaker A:** Get out of here. Right, exactly. Out you go. And this is what then creates that wholesomeness in the mind. One wholesome thought after another after another. And we know that they are because every thought that comes by is being checked. Do you get in or not? Just like the bouncer at the bar.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** Now, okay, every thought that comes to mind, we're going to say, are you wholesome or what? Are you wholesome or what? And when you get to the point that you can recognize, wow, this is pretty nice because we got one wholesome thought after another after another, now is the time we can relax and go into other things that's worth noting. But guess what? Here's the thing that's really brilliant. This is something that dawned on me only recently, and that is that once we get the mind in this wholesome state, then any noting that we're going to be doing, or any awareness practice that would be called meditation by anyone who teaches meditation, except that they are saying to look at what's there. And now we're saying, now we're saying, look at what's there, because the only thing that's there is wholesome. There is no unwholesome stuff there.

**Speaker B:** We've gladdened the mind into a very wholesome state. So when you know, it's just pure wholesomeness.

**Speaker A:** Yes. So let's now get a list going of what are the things that are worth looking at that are wholesome.

**Speaker B:** Things that are worth looking at that are wholesome. I mean, wholesome thoughts. You know, thoughts about wholesome, wholesome events. No. Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay. You're heading in the right direction. The wholesome events that are happening one by one as they occur in this present moment.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And also we're talking about the events, not that the door slams shut with the wind. But rather the events that are going on in the wholesome mind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Ah, now we're beginning to look at something. Okay, the events in the wholesome mind that are going to be wholesome things, the wholesome events. Well, we have just placed ourselves into this state. So this state is something that should be investigated. This wholesome state is worthy of investigation. And we find that the state in fact has various components to it, and one of the components is that we got ourselves into this state by investigation. Therefore, now we can turn the investigation on to the investigation with asking the question, "And how's my investigation?" Wow, my investigation is improving! I'm beginning to see things now I couldn't see before. All right, so this is the area that we're going in. Another thing that we can do then is we can add just about all the items on the Eightfold Noble Path. How is my Sati? Is my Sati getting quicker? Is my Sati getting stronger? Is my Sati getting quicker in two ways? One is that it comes up quick, and then the other, while it's dropped, how fast is it? Can you see things at a tenth of a second yet? Because that's down there where the level of the mind works, and you can begin to see how the mind works at this momentary level if we're quick enough to watch what's going on. So these are the questions: How fast is the mind right now? How is my Sati? Okay, another one would be right effort. How is my right effort? Do I have the right effort that it takes? The next one would be, how is my attitude? In fact, by going over and reviewing these things in the mind helps them grow. It is almost like playing the notes of a particular song and you play those notes over and over again, hearing that song. What is my song? Sati, awareness, mindfulness. Investigation, right attitude, all of that stuff is kicking, right? It's like a well-oiled engine hitting on all the cylinders, and we keep checking. Yeah, listening to that. Do we hear it? Because if one of the cylinders is not working, it's going to start knocking.

**Speaker B:** Yes. And then you stop and then you rejig it a little bit. You tune it up, you do some minor repairs, you start again, and then Exactly. All sounds good. Lovely. A little bit of repair work and we're on our way.

**Speaker A:** Exactly so. So then another list that we could work with besides the Eightfold Noble Path that is happening right here now is that we've been able to use these skills to place us in this state of mind that we're calling the first Jhana. So let's go look at all of the Jhana factors. In the sense of, how is my satisfaction right now? Am I really satisfied? Yeah, yeah, I really like this. This is real satisfaction. Another way that we look at it then is, how is the enthusiasm or exuberance? Enthusiasm and exuberance are very, very closely related, but exuberance takes a little bit more work where enthusiasm actually makes the work smaller. Exuberance is kind of over the top, and when we recognize that my feelings are quite over the top, that I'm in too much of a wow, I can settle that down and just be exuberant. I don't have to be elated.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, so this is the way more controlled. Uh-huh, more control beginning and more relaxation. Yeah, the more controlled it is and the more relaxed it becomes. That is literally like a wild animal that has no control. He is all over the forest.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** But if you can tie the dog to a tree, he may tug and pull for a while, but he's going to lay down and rest.

**Speaker B:** He's going to lay down. He's going to lay down in the sun, going to enjoy himself, going to relax, going to get a quick nap in, going to feel nice and warm and good.

**Speaker A:** Doing this, right? So we put these controls on the mind so that they don't have the dangers to go wander off in. Because if they wander into dangerous territory, now they got to deal with a bunch of dangerous stuff. If we're not out wandering anyplace, now we can stay relaxed. This is the whole idea then, is to stay out of dangerous territories of the mind and stay in really wholesome states. In this regard now, what we mean is that we can actually watch and see the ability to apply the mind to the wholesome and sustain it there. That also is something that becomes a lot of work, especially when we get the mind to the point that we can sustain, sustain, sustain. So now there's no more effort in the sustaining. We only need to apply and sustain when the mind is wavering and waffling around. But when the mind gets really stable, now we can leave off the applied and sustained thought. And what we mean by that is now we can begin to put some gaps between the wholesome thoughts. And these wholesome thoughts, in a way, are very much like music to our ears. Now you can hear where this is going, that with the breathing, we can begin to control the mind's wholesome thoughts. Once we have the mind fold into the wholesome. So as we breathe in, we breathe in joy, and as we breathe out, we relax, we relax. And at the end of that out-breath, we can leave some space, and so we don't have to have any thoughts or anything happening during that out-breath until the body needs air again. And so we're going to start pinning the breath and the thinking mind together so that the mind is going to stay quiet until the breathing starts again, or vice versa. Whichever comes first, the other one is to follow. So when you breathe in, you'll start thinking again automatically, but if you start thinking again, then that's the time to take a deep breath anyway, because it's normally by the count of 3 or 4. We're talking only about a couple of seconds of gap in there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** But in that gap, what are we going to do with that gap? Uh, we could get lost in the elation of the fact that we've controlled the mind and gotten it quiet.

**Speaker B:** The fact that it's quiet, you can try and remain there, right?

**Speaker A:** Right. Uh-huh. So you can investigate what quiet is while it's quiet, knowing

**Speaker B:** that when A quiet mind. What is this? Let me take a closer look. Ah, lovely. And then you're like, oh, I gotta breathe again.

**Speaker A:** Now here's the thing that makes this so different than Western meditation is because Western meditation thinks that meditation is going deep and that the no-mind is getting closer and closer to sleep, which is true. What we're doing is going in exactly the opposite direction. We're so alert and so awake, we don't have time to think about what we're doing. We're too busy doing it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, this is about— and this is actually, you can see it creeping into our language in the sense of some martial arts and other sports have the quality of the flow, the flow state, a flow state. This is exactly what we're getting ourselves into without the boxing gloves or the years of getting punched around or the million-dollar Ferrari. We don't need that car to get in this flow state. We could just sit there and pay close attention to what we're doing and get into that flow state of really paying close attention to what's going on, and we can do it even faster than the boxer or the martial artist because he's got to react to what he's seeing, so he's spending part of his time watching and part of his time reacting or defending himself with what his partner is doing. Here we can spend all of the time not defending because everything is wholesome.

**Speaker B:** We don't have to worry about getting punched in the face.

**Speaker A:** Right, we don't have to worry about getting punched in the face. Ourselves in the face, that we've got those blocks already built up.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Because in fact, this state we could get in and still be subject to hindrances. We do in fact slug ourselves in the face without even recognizing that that's what we're doing. That's why it's so important to get out of the hindrances so that we can basically get in the flow state while shadowboxing.

**Speaker B:** Shadow boxing. Yeah, yeah, you haven't got a risk of being punched in the face if you're doing that.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, no risk of getting punched in the face. And so the shadow boxing basically is even the shadow of a shadow, in the sense of everything is happening inside the mind. That in fact, the Buddha uses the shadow in the sense of talking about the internal states that we were talking about. And here he likens it to a tree, a real tree with real roots, really big trunk, really big branches, leaves, the whole nine yards. And then that tree is standing in the sun, and the sun and the tree together create a shadow of the tree. The shadow of the tree is even more, let us say, unstable than the tree itself. Yeah, the leaves blow in the wind of the tree, but tree's going to just stand there to where the shadow itself moves all the way around the tree.

**Speaker B:** And then what happens at night?

**Speaker A:** The shadow is gone. Exactly.

**Speaker B:** If it's a cloudy day, the shadow becomes, you know, weaker, I suppose.

**Speaker A:** So in that regard, the reality of the situation for ourselves is the tree itself, and those mental images that we construct is like the shadow. And it has stuff behind it that keeps us from being able to see the actual tree. We keep looking at a shadow. Now we're beginning to wake up through these wholesome states. We're beginning to see, wait a minute, what I'm actually looking at is a shadow. That's what's been running my life all my life. Let's start looking at the real deal for a while. Okay, this is when we get the mind really sharp and focused so that we can back it up even quicker in time to go beyond that level of feeling and perception down to just bare consciousness. Because that bare consciousness does not have to be evaluated, understood. Comprehended, cognized, or a story told about it. Because that storytelling takes us away from the actual experience.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Now that experience we're also looking at is the fact that things happen pretty

**Speaker B:** fast, happen very fast.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but the human mind is very slow because we see something, then we dig up out of our past, we process it, we turn to a conclusion. That conclusion impacts us, and so finally we have a result of feelings.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and those feelings are a lot of Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** That takes time in there. Okay, if we can back up the mind to get it faster and faster and faster, when our Sati is getting faster and faster, that means we could see how the mind creates this mental image, how perception actually works. And we can get right down to the level of consciousness to just get in the flow, literally, and just be in it. This is what they actually mean when they use words like being at one with nature, making one with everything. Why is that? Because we're not going through the secondary process of trying to figure it out. We're just letting it be.

**Speaker B:** Just let it be.

**Speaker A:** Very sharp level where the mind is really sharp.

**Speaker B:** Sharp.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, not deep in meditation, but it is really sharp in recognizing exactly how the mind does function and does operate. And this is all very wholesome, and this can all be done in the first Jhana. This can all— you can actually see consciousness, you can see how the mind actually works, you can see these feelings. And the place that we're going to work with those feelings for the while, to gain up the skills that I'm talking about, because this is a bit process of building skills is to make sure that at that point of contact that we've only wound up with a wholesome thought. That's the thing we're going to start working on it over and over again so that we're going to start tweaking or tweedling this old Sankhara to not bring up old dirty past laundry. We're going to get a brand new suit every day.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that's the way. Always everything is new, everything is brand new. I don't have to spend so much time trying to make what I see new into something old that I hated once. I can leave this new thing as it is new without adding my old perceptions and anger and frustrations and not liking and all of that kind of stuff.

**Speaker B:** Trying to force yourself to understand something when you don't need to. It sounds like a very, very Western thing to try and understand everything. Very, very well.

**Speaker A:** They just experience it rather than just— exactly, exactly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. Trying too hard to understand and to know everything rather than just letting it be, seeing it for what it is and just experiencing it. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But in order to do that, this is a skill that has to be developed.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And part of the skill has to do with several things. One of the most important ones is the speed of how quick can we wake up, how fast can we see what is happening. Yeah, do we have to let 4 or 5 mind moments go before we wake up in a mind moment? Or we can have a mind moment and wake, and a mind moment and wake, and a mind moment and wake. That's about the best we could do. Yeah, is to wake up to this is what's happening. Got it. This is how— got it. This— got it. Okay, but in the process of this In this discussion, or while we're sitting in that wholesome state, watching things as they occur, one by one, wholesome things, we not only watch them arise, but we also watch them pass away.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** you don't consecutively— together. And so when this arises, it's going to pass away. When this arises, this is going to pass away., then when this arises over here, this is going to pass away. And so we have this arising and passing away, everything keeps littering from one mind-moment to the next. There's always this up and down motion of the living and the dying of every event that is part of this cycle of Anicca, or this cycle of cause and effect. This caused that, okay, but this causation now is gone. And this is the result, but now that result becomes the cause, and so it causes the next thing to arise, and then that one dies away. This stuff happens so fast that we don't even know how fast. I mean, it's way beyond the speed of science. All of our measuring equipment is far too slow to catch how things— because like a very, very high-speed camera that does a billion frames a second, in that one billionth of a second, how many causes and effects from the eye, the lens opening, the light hitting the back plane, let's see, what is it, a charge-coupled device.

**Speaker B:** Got it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. The charge-coupled device has to send electrons down an amplifier, which is going to pick those pixels up, rearrange them into an order so that it could store an image someplace.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. How many causes and effects are in that? Loads. Okay. So can we get all of that going down to the point of can we do a whole camera with all the stuff a camera's got to do in one cycle of cause and effect? It's impossible.

**Speaker B:** Not a chance.

**Speaker A:** Not a chance. And so there is a hole in physics because we don't know how fast things happen, because we can't measure how fast things happen because the measuring takes so much longer than the thing happened.

**Speaker B:** That's crazy to think about, that is.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's how— well, no, this means that now we've got a job to do. We're going to say we can't do causality, but we can certainly watch the cycles of the mind. That in fact, generally in computer science, if you take a degree in computer science, one of those courses is going to be very close to the hardware. Yeah, where you've got to actually understand this instruction does this, and you like load, add, store, branch on condition. All of those little, uh, instructions are similar to the way that the mind works also. Okay, that there's little bits and pieces down at the level of the instruction set, which would be one machine cycle. Well, in the human brain, we call that a mind moment. The machine cycle. What's the fastest that you could do? Okay. An example of that would be on the internet. You can go look for this, and that is that there are tests for reaction time.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And they will have a red screen. And then as soon as the screen turns green or blue, you click the mouse. Yeah. And then your computer with the software that's in the HTML will calculate how long it took for that turn, that screen to turn green before you click the mouse. Yeah, most people can get it under 300 milliseconds. Most people can get it under 300 milliseconds. Generally, women are a bit slower than men. On average, men are about 220 milliseconds, but you can get it down faster. They say, in fact, if you can get it down to 200 milliseconds, you're in the realm of black belt karate.

**Speaker B:** Really?

**Speaker A:** Okay. And if you can get it down to about 180 milliseconds, that's Olympic champion, world class.

**Speaker B:** Oh my goodness.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Okay. So we're talking about a range of things. These mind moments are not like computers that have a very heavy-duty clock that keeps that thing kicking. Yeah, some mind moments are long. But if you're right on top of it, you can get that click down to about 200 milliseconds at black belt level, which means two things. One, it means you saw it. And number two, you click the mouse. Yeah, that's two mind moments. 200 milliseconds is right down there where everybody estimates a mind moment lasts about a tenth of a second. And this reaction time system will, will prove that exactly how fast, because it's only a very simple thing. Now let us say that, that they could change color 2 or 3 times, but only when this current screen goes completely green do you click the mouse. That will take longer. Yes, because you have to take more mind moments to make decisions in there about is this This is not green, this is blue, don't click. This is yellow, not green. It's not just that something changed, it's now you have to make a new discernment, which is going to take a new mind moment in

**Speaker B:** there. There's layers to it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. So there's many layers to it. And so by understanding these kinds of things and playing these kinds of games on the internet, you can begin to test yourself, see how your mind operates and things like that. With this ordinary stuff that ordinary people do, so that then when you go into these really wholesome states that we're talking about, into this Jhana, now you can actually begin to understand directly of how the mind

**Speaker B:** works.

**Speaker A:** We can understand directly what are these skills that we're developing, and we can understand these Jhana states. We can see what is exhilaration, what is enthusiasm, because we have already started building enthusiasm. As we grow in our skills, our enthusiasm grows while our euphoria kind of melts away into a satisfied Sukkha, so that we're completely at rest and completely alert at the same time because the enthusiasm is there. It's almost like a jack-in-the-box, you know, where you turn the crank and it plays a little song about Pop Goes the Weasel and whatnot like that. Okay, most of us are like the jack-in-the-box, except that after we turn the crank and the door opens, we got to go in there and grab the jack-in-the-box and pull him out.

**Speaker B:** The Arhat, but nothing pops out.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Nothing pops up. Okay, well, after we develop the skill, then it's like the jack-in-the-box. When we turn the crank, the lid pops open, the jack-in-the-box pops out, the whole sub-pops just pop right up.

**Speaker B:** Just pops right out, no effort.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so we need to notice that also, that how's my effort? My effort right now is bring loaded. That's my

**Speaker B:** effort. Spring-loaded effort.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, spring-loaded effort. So as soon as the trick goes off, we don't have to get up, get dressed, and go to work. It's spring-loaded, they go, and so we just automatically start taking those deep breaths. We automatically start gladdening the mind and go right into the wholesome. So there it is. And so this is also something to look at. How is that effort? Work? Is it actually energy now? This is just getting dead easy now. This is getting completely easy because even the effort now is almost a surprise at how much little effort it actually

**Speaker B:** takes. Yeah, it may take a lot of effort at first, but after, as time goes on, the effort is less and less and less to get the same result.

**Speaker A:** Deep inside, we begin to see this being in a wholesome state is so much better than being in the ordinary state of up and down and back and forth and critical and yes, I like this and no, I don't like that, into this completely wholesome state. I see everything is just so good. And so naturally now, you know, well, what are we going to do when we get that into that state? We're going to do an

**Speaker B:** inventory. How is my sati. How is my attitude, my effort? How is all of that, huh? Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick,

**Speaker A:** tick. Right. And that starts to build up our confidence even more.

**Speaker B:** Alliance confidence.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yes. Alliance confidence. We've got all the tools. Right. So another analogy we can use is being like a night watchman on rounds. Okay, and this can be used in the sense of the word concentration, because a lot of people think that what we're doing in meditation is building up concentration. Concentration then would be like the guard sitting at his guard desk reading a Hoochie Goochie book. He's really focused and concentrating on it, but he's not doing his job, doing his job.

**Speaker B:** He's not aware of what's going on at the facility, the building, right?

**Speaker A:** He's got to go do his job. He's got to go check every doorknob. Okay, this is what we're doing when we're in this, uh, this state of basically the empty building. And here we are, the guard, we're the night guard of an empty building, and it's our job to go make sure that everything is secure and wholesome. And so this is a— this is the analogy. And we go check, yeah, that door's locked, Yep, that was locked. Yep, that was locked. Everything is locked down. I like that. And so we just go through checking things out on guard to make sure that everything is okay. So this is the way that we begin to practice once we get the mind in that really wholesome state. And by the way, all of this is discussed in a particular sutta, number 111 in the Majjhima Nikaya. And the name of it is One by One as They Occur.

**Speaker B:** One by One as They Occur, where

**Speaker A:** the Buddha is talking about Sariputta. And this actually, this sutta seems to be based upon some catchphrases and other things. It seems to be very, very old, an old sutta.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Open in the sense that this wasn't when Sariputta was an old man and the Buddha was an old man sitting in reminiscing. This seems to have been like the year it happened. This is early. And the sutta is talking about the kind of wisdom that Sariputta has, and it uses the typical suspects of sharp wisdom, fast wisdom, but the Buddha also included the word "lapping

**Speaker B:** wisdom." I saw that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I just— I like that one. My favorite kind of wisdom. Sharp wisdom is good stuff, but laughing wisdom, that's the top quality. And then the Buddha says, and this is how he did it. And then it says, for a fortnight, Sariputta practice in this way. A fortnight, 2 weeks, 2 straight weeks, 2 straight weeks. And yet many people in modern times, they'll do 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 6 months of a meditation retreat, not getting much out of it.

**Speaker B:** All

**Speaker A:** right, so here's the question: what was Sariputta doing? Yeah. And the answer to that would be, before we ask that question, let us say what was he already skilled at? What skill did he bring? Because he was already a mendicant, and back during those days, just like the Buddha, Shariputra was probably already skilled in the Jhanas. He just didn't know what to do with them, right? Right, right, right. Okay, and so now this, the next paragraph of the sutta, it starts this way. The word quite secluded is the big term. It starts the sentence: quite secluded from sensual pleasures, quite secluded from all unwholesome states, period. Well, you know, as far as I'm concerned, you can finish the sutta right

**Speaker B:** now. That's it. That's all you need to know.

**Speaker A:** That's it right there. Quite secluded from the unwholesome states. And then it immediately says he entered in and abided in the first jhana. Well, this is the whole point— getting the mind into these wholesome states, and the jhana factors arise and come. When he gets there, then it's one by one as they occur, not in the sense of one by one as they occur in the writing of the sutta. When we read, we read this word, that word, this word, and that word. But here we're saying one by one as they as they occur in the mind or as they arise, as they take advantage of the mind-moment and come to mind. And so this is where that list is that I was telling you about. This starts off with the Jhana factors, the Eightfold Noble Path, adds a few things from the Sambojhana including equanimity and enthusiasm and paying attention, all of those really wholesome things that we are going to be paying attention to. And then it says that as Theraputta was paying attention to this, he paid first attention to the arising of these states, and then he began to pay attention to the arising and the passing away, that when this one arises, that one passes away, when this one arises, that one passes away. That's the way that we begin to see that everything is in turmoil and everything is in flux. And then after that, when we see everything is just flickering away, by seeing that, Vincenzo says that he knows that there is an end to all of this. And with constant practice, he began to say for sure, I know that there is an end to this. Yeah. Okay, that's how we— and so all of these other suttas that talk about these various things. Here the Buddha is packing it into a package deal. But like I said, the way that the sutra is written, it looks like it's actually quite old. And so this has been the teaching of the Buddha all along, all along about getting the mind cleaned out so that we in fact can do the evaluation of the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Noble Path. How's this? How's that? What is the Third Noble Truth? Are we free from suffering yet, Daddy? Are we there yet, Daddy? Yeah, we're there. Here it is. Yeah, we're free from suffering. This is it. Okay, so this is something that we have to examine, and by examining it, we can recognize that there is an end to this suffering. Here it is. This is the practice. We can bring ourselves to this end by focusing on only the wholesome things. Yeah. And so that's what this sutta is about. The whole show is basically them, him going through the suttas or going through the jhanas. But as he does so, he's only removing the factors of the first jhana that are not there in the second. So as we go higher in the jhanas, they're just merely less and less to notice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** At no point do we ever go into anything like a dark night of the soul of fear, misery, despair, disgust, and strong desire to get out, which is, by the way, I think steps 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 of the, uh, uh, um, the 16 stages of insight that Mohasi has, right? Right, right, right. And here's the distinction is the Mahasi starts them noting but they don't really become dedicated to the noting until after they go through despair and this great desire to be free from suffering. It's only then when they take it up, and they could have been practicing for 20 years wrongly before they finally figure out that we've got to clean the mind, we've got to be free from this, we've got to be free from this, we've got to be free from disgust, we've got to be free from all of that stuff, so that we can now see things the way that they are, so that we can see clearly enough to see the end of it

**Speaker B:** all. There is an end. That's the end.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the end of it all is to see how the mind works so that we can begin to take control over it with the same let us say gusto that we started with the whacking of the cows, gusto of actually taking a deep breath, the gusto of seizing the object and taking control of it. We've got to take control of the breathing and then take control of the thoughts to make them wholesome, so that eventually we can take the the control of the thoughts to put blanks and spaces in there where we can really see what's going on in between. But we still have to grab that object too.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I like the analogy with the cows. When I catch myself thinking unwholesomely, I do sort of close my eyes a little bit and then get back in line.

**Speaker A:** Let's go, come on, come on, doggies, let's do this job right. Exactly. So That's such a beautiful analogy, and I'm glad that it works so well for you.

**Speaker B:** It really does. It really, really does. It's a very, very effective analogy.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so now we recognize that that whacking of the cows has to be done even at later stages when the cows are all wholesome.

**Speaker B:** When they're all in the pasture.

**Speaker A:** And they're all in the pasture, or in the sense of even beyond when there's no more cows left, we still have to whack them, because there's going to be a new kind of cow, in the sense of now we're not dealing with just feelings, now we're dealing with perception itself. How does the mind actually concoct the kind of crap that I've been used to feeding myself? Yeah, okay. So this is how— and so we have to actually grab and take hold of perception so that we can begin to make some gaps between consciousness and perception, so that we can see things the way that they they actually really are. And the Buddha talks about it. And in fact, this statement that I'm about to make is one of the things that makes the sutta seem so old, is because this phrase has been also in sutras that we know for sure are very old, like the Sutta Nipata and the Upadana, where this sutta we're talking about now that seems to be old but is in the Middle Length Saying. So that means that it's was put together with the stuff that was put together at the time of the Buddha's death. Okay, so we go back to that old phrase, and this is what we find there, is when the scene is merely the scene and the heard is merely the heard and the cognized is merely the cognized and the touch is merely touched or felt it's merely a touch. Or when we see something, it's merely the scene. It's not taking the perception time to concoct a story about it. It's just merely the scene.

**Speaker B:** It's just purely experience.

**Speaker A:** It's pure experience. And there's going to be a lot of experience when things are— when the scene is merely the scene. Then there's a lot of seeing going on because there's a lot to see with the eyes. I mean, it's amazing,

**Speaker B:** just, um, uh,

**Speaker A:** the gaze into your room, and you can then close your eyes and you recognize there's so much stuff in the room. You can't memorize everything in the room. It is far too complicated, and we haven't been paying attention. But now if we're seeing merely the scene, then we can see what it is. We don't have to name it, but we can see it.

**Speaker B:** You can see it. You don't have to assign it something.

**Speaker A:** This is what can be called photographic memory. Yeah. Why? Actually, what that means is the person who has photographic memory is only looking. He's not telling himself a story.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Because if he tells himself a story, then all he remembers is the story he told, and he doesn't remember what he actually saw. But if we can get down to the scene as merely the scene, then we can actually see it as if

**Speaker B:** it were a photograph. There's no narrative attached to the scene. Exactly. It is just purely a scene.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly. So this is where we're going when the mind gets really, really sharp. I don't expect you to be able to do that yet, But you do know where you're going with it. Yeah. How's my Sati? How's my perception? Can I see myself actually concocting

**Speaker B:** thoughts? Yeah, I think I've had a few instances of where I've been able to see myself concocting thoughts. And then if I've noticed that the thoughts are unwholesome, then I'm like, hey, Arahant, exactly.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, yeah, exactly. So this is the way that we practice now, is that we practice getting ourselves into wholesome states, and then we practice by noting one by one as they occur all the various wholesome states that are associated with how we are right now— these Jhana factors, these path factors. And in a way, uh, the whole show of the Four Noble Truths is there in evidence. And as we do this investigation, one of the things that we're going to look for is, but where am I in all of this? And the answer is you're not going to find

**Speaker B:** it. Oh, the self, the, the, the, uh, absence of the self.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, it's actually When we are in wholesome states, it's absent. When we are in unwholesome states, that's when we become selfish.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** If we can understand the teaching of the Buddha, of anatta and atta and that whole show, the easiest way for an individual to get a good handle on it is by using not the word self, but the word selfish. Are you selfish right now, or are you unselfish?

**Speaker B:** Selfish.

**Speaker A:** If you are unselfish right now, then that's wholesome. If you're selfish, that's not wholesome. And when you're selfish, what does that mean? You're defensive, you're trying to protect yourself. It's dangerous. Okay, when you take something that belongs to me, that's mine, and I'm going to get angry because I'm afraid that I'll lose something. And then so you can see that in fact all the unwholesome feelings that we have have are associated with self. Yeah, when we're completely in the wholesome, there's no self there. And then we say, wait a minute, now we understand the teachings of the Buddha correctly. This is where the self comes from, is that it's something concocted that needs to be concocted in order to be

**Speaker B:** protected. Needs to be concocted to protect it, to be protected. That is, that is stupid. It needs to concoct itself to then be protected. That is pointless.

**Speaker A:** That is human though. That, yeah, that is so human.

**Speaker B:** Very, very human.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so Mr. A and Mr. B are having a conversation. Mr. B says how bad Republican Party C is. Okay. And how bad political party C is, if Mr. A is not in either that party or the opposition party, then he's not going to get selfish about it because it's not his. But if you start destroying his party, then his selfishness will come up and he will have bad feelings because you're hurting his party. But if that party is not his party, then you can trash it away. He'll help you trash it. He don't care. It's not

**Speaker B:** his.

**Speaker A:** Yes. And so, if we stop identifying with political parties, then we stop a whole lot of

**Speaker B:** suffering.

**Speaker A:** If we stop identifying with, "I'm an Englishman," or, "I'm a Tibetan," or, "I'm a this or that," anything that we identify with is going to cause us suffering; that's being selfish. I'm placing myself into that thing, which means that when it burns down, I burn down too.

**Speaker B:** I burn down with it, yeah.

**Speaker A:** But when I'm not in it, it can burn down by itself happily without me. And so this is how we begin to see— this is the wholesome, is to not identify with things. It's unwholesome to identify that I am that. I am a Christian, or I am a Buddhist, or I am this, that, or the other thing. And anything that I can claim that I am will cause me suffering when it's

**Speaker B:** attacked.

**Speaker A:** So don't identify with anything. It's wholesome not to identify. This is the easiest way to understand what self is, is what we identify to. Yeah, identify with anything, then it doesn't matter what you say about it. Or, I mean, the Democratic Party could go belly up this afternoon And only a few people are going to laugh hysterically over that. I want to see it. I want to see

**Speaker B:** it. Yeah, yeah, only a few people.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. But a whole lot of people are trying to keep it upright, and a whole lot of other people are trying to knock it over, and everybody's unhappy.

**Speaker B:** Yes, even if you're trying to knock it over and, you know, you've succeeded or whatever, in the process of trying to do it, you were very, very unhappy because you are identifying with it.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. So this is what we mean by the self, and when we can see things from a purely wholesome place, we can see that that identification is dangerous. I shall not do that, but I'm beginning to see how the mind works, and the way that we identify things is by bringing up the past.

**Speaker B:** Damn the past.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. And so living more in the present moment is the way to go. Yeah, much more wholesome.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it really is. It's a hell of a lot more wholesome. It does seem like pretty much all of people's problems and issues just stem from the past. It's a very human thing to do.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Well, we had the delusion that the world is a very dangerous place and I've got to learn my way around and I got to keep track of a whole bunch of crap going on because it's dangerous. Yeah. But now that we're adults, now that we're fully functioning adults and winners, we can recognize, no, I can handle all of that. There's not an issue, not a problem. But when we're little kids, we feel really overwhelmed. And so we got to keep track of stuff. We almost get into that state of I got to get, I got to get, it because it's really dangerous if I don't. Now we can relax with that. We don't have to do that

**Speaker B:** anymore.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you were successful. Your life is safe

**Speaker B:** now. Yeah, yeah. I mean, it also comes from, you know, like the stony age, the Stone Age stuff, you know. The world is a dangerous place because I got saber-toothed tigers coming after me and giant wolves and cave bears and stuff.

**Speaker A:** In a way, the Stone Age was started because mankind could see things were dangerous and we needed some stones.

**Speaker B:** We needed something to combat the danger.

**Speaker A:** You're right, exactly. This is the beginning of human materialism, is picking up that stone. Now, other animals— I mean, otters, for instance— will pick up stones.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, use it to smash oysters and stuff like that.

**Speaker A:** What does he do with the stone once he smashes the oyster? What does the human do with the stone after he bashes another human skull with it? And so we as humans start collecting materialism Collecting material goods because we find safety in them. Yeah, guess what? That human being that picked up that rock and clung to it, it just all of a sudden— I mean, I don't know how long it took, but that stone turned into a cell phone. But the man is the same.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, man is the same, but the The object is different. The clinging to something is the same.

**Speaker A:** The clinging is the same.

**Speaker B:** The clinging is the same. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It doesn't matter if there's tens of thousands of years of separation. But it's mine. It's mine. Oh, I like this. It's mine. It makes me feel safe.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And you see, the otter doesn't do that.

**Speaker B:** The otter is just like, cool, I've used the utility.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And after the utility is finished, the rock is too. The same thing is with apes, chimpanzees and larger apes will take a reed and poke it down into a hole for the grubs to start eating that reed, and when they can feel the grub eating it, they'll pull it out. What do they do with the reed after they get the grub? What does the American— excuse me, yeah, what does the American do with his reed? He puts it in his breast pocket with all the other reeds that he's been collecting. He's a nerd, you know. Know, he's got a pocket lighter for his

**Speaker B:** reeds. Yes, so the monkey, the chimp, the ape sees utility. He knows that he can get something which will work just perfectly fine when he next needs it, so that's fine.

**Speaker A:** He sees it as mine, and that's where the danger comes in, is clinging to material goods as if they belong to me rather than just I'm just tossing it out because I'm finished with the utility. And then the new student on the block will say, well, yeah, but maybe I'll need that rock later. Now he's in the wrong. You stole my thunder. Yeah, many times students are a step ahead of me. They know exactly what I'm about to

**Speaker B:** say. But yeah, clinging to the past. Oh, what if? What if as well. You said what if. What if thinking, not helpful. Exactly.

**Speaker A:** Because we're thinking about danger. What if the danger? What if the danger is no danger? If I need a rock, there's rocks, plenty of rocks. But I don't need a rock right now because there's no

**Speaker B:** danger. Exactly, exactly.

**Speaker A:** And yet how many possessions does a normal average human being own because they think that it's going to become useful

**Speaker B:** someday?

**Speaker A:** Or look how many, like in America, Why is it the Americas, the American people, it must be the most dangerous place in the world because of all

**Speaker B:** the stuff they've got, right?

**Speaker A:** They gotta buy the guns to protect all the stuff they've

**Speaker B:** got. It's got to be the most dangerous place on Earth, you know. They've got all the stuff that they need, and then they need stuff to protect their stuff. Stuff to protect their stuff.

**Speaker A:** That is— wow. Exactly right. And they all do it in the—

**Speaker B:** in

**Speaker A:** the, um, uh, let us say, under the service of protecting me.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so the underlying feeling for all of this materialism is the feeling of fear. And so we have to learn to find a way of getting fear out of the mind. And the way to do that— the reason that the fear keeps coming back into mind is because of all the unwholesome thoughts of maybe this and maybe that. If we remove the unwholesome thoughts and have only wholesome thoughts in the mind, then there's nothing to fear. There is no danger right now. Yeah. And so that's the new state to get in. Is to get into that state of fearlessness, which is part actually at this point in time is the part of Sukkha, of feeling safe, secure, and satisfied, comfortable. This is the feeling that we can have when the mind is not being selfishly endangered. Yeah. And so even if the Buddha didn't give us anything to do with this state of mind, just being in it all the time is quite a

**Speaker B:** benefit. Yeah, it sounds like a very pleasant state of mind to find yourself in, so I should strive to be in it as much as possible. Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** You have the additional point of how to maintain that and make it improve and even better. Is by now we're going to start intentionally taking care of noting things that are all wholesome that are still left.

**Speaker B:** Chuck out the unwholesome, note the wholesome, and be like,

**Speaker A:** yeah, that's nice. So this is the way that we practice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And this is— and I'm glad today, uh, Ben, that we were actually able to weave in various aspects of the teaching of Paticcasamuppada, because the student needs a bit of the foundation of how the mind works in order to even understand why and how this sutta is set up. Yes, but we're already at the point of now that we have this first Jhana capabilities, we need to know what

**Speaker B:** to do with it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay, so this is what we're going to do with it. We're going to examine how the mind works when the mind is in a really wholesome state.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** We want to examine these skills that we got into it. We're going to examine the features of it, and we're going to see this stuff arising and passing away and arising and passing away. Cause-effect, cause-effect, cause-effect, cause-effect. And it's actually quite a magic show.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sounds very magical. Very, very magical.

**Speaker A:** And so good luck with

**Speaker B:** that. Yes, yes. I look forward to it. I look forward to it.

**Speaker A:** Well, do you have any questions about what we've been talking about today?

**Speaker B:** No, no, no. It's all been very, very comprehensive, very, very comprehensive and very interesting. Testing as well,

**Speaker A:** actually. Well, let us hope you don't have to go die in Manchester again before you call

**Speaker B:** me. Yeah, so when I got back, I had a COVID test and everything, and all good, all good. But it wasn't pleasant. It wasn't pleasant. You have to shove something up your nose, and it felt very strange.

**Speaker A:** Oh, you're talking about a COVID test?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You have to do something on the throat and then shove something up your nose and— well, they know where the COVID stay. Exactly, exactly. It felt very unnatural, very strange.

**Speaker A:** The only way to get in there, instead of drawing a knife directly, they take a long stick and stab it up your nose about that

**Speaker B:** far. It was all It was very odd, but all clean, all healthy. Very good. Very, very good.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Now you know what it's like for the next time you have the test.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. I know what to expect. And hopefully I won't go bleh bleh as it happens. Yeah. But no, lovely to speak to you again today. This has been a very, very interesting, comprehensive, extensive and in-depth conversation. And thank you very much.

**Speaker A:** I'm glad that you found some use of it.

**Speaker B:** Oh yes, yes, plenty of use.

**Speaker A:** All right, Ben, well, we'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, speak again soon. Take care and thank you very much for today.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye. Okay, bye-bye. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) in dialogue with a Sangha friend named Ben (Speaker B), centers on **training the mind to dwell in wholesome states as the foundation for insight and liberation.**

Here is a structured summary of the key teachings:

### **Core Metaphor: The Mind as a Ship Without Brakes**
The mind is likened to a ship or boat that has a rudder (guidance) but no brakes. Therefore, one must skillfully steer it **in advance** to avoid crashing into suffering (dukkha). The key is not to force thoughts to stop (which is impossible and counterproductive), but to learn to **guide** them skillfully.

### **The Primary Task: Cultivating a Wholesome Mind**
The foundational practice, which many overlook, is to deliberately cultivate a mind free from unwholesome states (hindrances like ill-will, sensual desire, restlessness).
*   **Critical vs. Nurturing Mind:** We often operate from a critical, judgmental inner voice (shaped by childhood conditioning). The practice is to shift to a nurturing, wholesome inner dialogue.
*   **The "Bouncer at the Bar":** At the moment a thought arises ("point of contact"), one must act as a bouncer, asking: **"Is this thought wholesome or unwholesome?"** Unwholesome thoughts are recognized and dismissed ("get out of here!"), while wholesome ones are allowed to stay.
*   **Releasing the Past:** Much of our unwholesome reaction comes from **concocting stories** based on past experiences and judgments (e.g., disliking someone because of their past). Wisdom at the point of contact sees this "pile of crap" for what it is and lets it go, allowing us to meet the present moment anew.

### **The Goal: Abiding in the First Jhāna (Wholesome Baseline)**
The aim is to establish the mind in a **secluded, wholesome state**—identified with the first jhāna—free from sensual desires and unwholesome qualities. In this state:
*   The mind is "gladdened," happy, secure, and fit for work.
*   Everything that arises for investigation is already wholesome.
*   This state is **not a dull, sleepy trance**, but an alert, bright, "spring-loaded" flow state of heightened awareness.

### **Practice in the Wholesome State: "One by One as They Occur"**
Once the wholesome mind is established, the meditation practice (based on MN 111) is to investigate the wholesome phenomena themselves as they arise and pass:
1.  **Inventory of Wholesome Factors:** Systematically note and gladden the mind with the wholesome factors present (e.g., the Jhāna factors like joy and tranquility; the Path factors like right effort, mindfulness, and attitude).
2.  **Observing Arising & Passing Away:** See these wholesome states and mental moments themselves arising and ceasing, understanding the rapid, flickering nature of all conditioned things (anicca).
3.  **Developing Speed & Precision:** The goal is to increase the **speed of mindfulness (sati)** to catch mind-moments as they happen, eventually perceiving the process of how consciousness leads to perception and mental concoction.
4.  **Creating Gaps:** By synchronizing wholesome thoughts with the breath, one can create brief, silent gaps between thoughts. In these gaps, one can investigate the nature of "quiet" itself with sharp awareness.

### **Advanced Insight from the Wholesome Base**
From this stable, wholesome platform, deeper insight unfolds:
*   **Seeing Reality Directly:** One can begin to see "the scene as merely the scene," perception without the added narrative—a form of pure, non-conceptual experience.
*   **Understanding Not-Self (Anattā):** In wholesome states, the sense of a solid, selfish "I" disappears. **Selfishness is the marker of unwholesome states.** The "self" is seen as a concoction for protection, rooted in fear and identification (with views, possessions, groups). Letting go of identification ends suffering related to those things.
*   **The Root of Materialism & Fear:** The discussion traces societal materialism and fear back to this primitive, clinging "self" that grasps at things (like a stone or a phone) for security. A wholesome mind is fearless and free from such clinging.

### **Conclusion**
The entire path is framed as:
1.  **Skillfully steering** the mind away from unwholesome states.
2.  **Diligently abiding** in a cultivated wholesome state (first jhāna).
3.  **Investigate** that wholesome mind and its processes to see the true nature of reality (impermanence, suffering in unwholesome states, not-self).
4.  This leads to the direct realization that **there is an end to suffering**, achievable here and now through this practice.

The talk emphasizes that this method is joyful, alert, and builds confidence, contrasting it with approaches that involve trudging through "dark nights of the soul" or trying to force concentration. The essence is **building a happy, skillful mind and then using that mind to gain liberating wisdom.**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this detailed dialogue, the speaker uses a rich tapestry of **metaphors and stories** to explain Buddhist meditation concepts and the nature of the mind. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Primary Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **The Mind as a Ship/Rowboat without Brakes**
    *   **Purpose:** To explain that the mind cannot be forcibly stopped; it must be steered skillfully in advance to avoid "crashing" into unwholesome states.
    *   **Key detail:** A big ship crashing into a harbor at walking speed still causes massive damage, illustrating that even gradual, habitual negative thinking is harmful.

2.  **Critical Parent vs. Nurturing Parent / Critical Mind vs. Nurturing Mind**
    *   **Purpose:** To frame the internal dialogue. The goal is to shift from a judgmental, critical inner voice to a kind, nurturing one, aligning with the Buddha's distinction between unwholesome and wholesome thoughts.

3.  **Learning to Play the Piano (Chords and Scales)**
    *   **Purpose:** To argue that meditation requires foundational skills (like mindfulness and investigation) before one can "play music" (achieve deeper insight or peace). It's about building mental fitness.

4.  **The Bouncer at the Bar**
    *   **Purpose:** To describe the practice of selective attention. One must act as a bouncer for the mind, only allowing wholesome thoughts to enter and stay, while turning away unwholesome ones.

5.  **The Well-Oiled Engine / Tuning Up a Car**
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate the harmonious, smooth functioning of a mind in a wholesome state. If one "cylinder" (like effort or mindfulness) is off, you hear a "knock" and need to "tune it up."

6.  **Tying a Dog to a Tree**
    *   **Purpose:** To explain how control leads to relaxation. A wild (uncontrolled) mind roams into dangerous territory, but a mind gently tethered to a wholesome object (like the breath) will eventually settle and rest.

7.  **The Night Watchman on Rounds**
    *   **Purpose:** To redefine *concentration*. True meditation isn't like a guard zoning out at a desk (focusing on one thing to the exclusion of all else). It's like a watchman actively checking that every door (every mental state) is secure and wholesome.

8.  **The Tree and Its Shadow**
    *   **Purpose:** To distinguish between reality and our mental projections. The actual tree is reality ("the real deal"), while the shadow is our mental concoction—our stories, judgments, and past associations that obscure direct experience.

9.  **The Jack-in-the-Box**
    *   **Purpose:** To describe the development of effort. Initially, effort is clumsy and manual (you have to crank and pull). With skill, it becomes "spring-loaded"—effortless, automatic, and immediate.

10. **Whacking the Cows**
    *   **Purpose:** (Mentioned by Speaker B as an effective analogy from a previous talk). This seems to be a herding metaphor—gently guiding straying thoughts (unwholesome "cows") back into the pasture of wholesome awareness.

### **Stories & Extended Examples**

1.  **The Story of Donald Trump as an Entertainer**
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate how we burden the present moment with past judgments. The speaker argues that if people could see Trump *only* as he is now (a comedian/entertainer), without past baggage, they'd react differently. This parallels how we treat *ourselves* by layering past failures onto our present identity.

2.  **The Blind Person from Birth**
    *   **Purpose:** To demonstrate that all thought is constructed from past sensory experience. A person blind from birth doesn't have visual thoughts, proving that our mental images are built from memory, not direct reality.

3.  **The Evolution of a Musician (Drums/Piano) & Touch Typing**
    *   **Purpose:** To show the progression from conscious effort to unconscious skill. Beginners look at the instrument (external), intermediates look at the sheet music (concept), and professionals interact with the audience (flow state). This mirrors the meditation journey from forced effort to effortless awareness.

4.  **The Stone Age Human vs. The Otter**
    *   **Purpose:** To explain the root of materialism and clinging. An otter uses a rock as a tool and discards it. A human clings to the rock ("mine") out of perceived future danger. This clinging escalates from rocks to cell phones to guns, all driven by underlying fear.

5.  **Reference to the Sutta "One by One as They Occur" (MN 111)**
    *   **Purpose:** This is the core textual story underpinning the entire talk. The speaker recounts how Sariputta practiced by first secluding his mind from unwholesome states (entering the first jhana) and then meticulously noting wholesome mental factors "one by one as they occur," observing their arising and passing away to gain insight.

### **Overarching Themes**
The metaphors collectively emphasize:
*   **Steering, not stopping:** The mind is dynamic, not something to suppress.
*   **Skill development:** Meditation is a practical skill set, like music or mechanics.
*   **From forced effort to effortless flow:** The path leads from hard work to spring-loaded ease.
*   **Cleaning the lens:** The goal is to clear away the "shadow" of past concoctions to see "the tree" of present-moment reality.
*   **Wholesomeness as a safe harbor:** Cultivating a wholesome mind is the prerequisite for all deeper insight, creating a safe, fear-free internal space for investigation.
