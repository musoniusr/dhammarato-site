### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Is it fine to just watch and see what's going on, or like, is there things that you kind of have to pay attention to? Because when I ask myself that, then boom, like I'm back in uncertainty. Like, so then I know, like, I'm like, oh wait, hold up, like, is there something to do here, or just vibe and chill, I guess?

**Speaker B:** Okay, so you're saying the practice is going good. And you got yourself feeling good, right? And then you ask yourself, is there something else I should be doing? Right? Okay, then that would be the first unwholesome thought. Right. All right. Like, just correct me if I'm wrong, if I didn't understand the situation correctly. But so essentially, what I— the practice that you were doing was the wholesome thoughts, right? Thinking yourself into a state of feeling good, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And so you were doing it successfully up until that point where you had a thought, is there something else that I should be doing? Right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** No, that's on the— So then that would just be— So the thing to do there is just wake up to that thought, pooping the party, right? So like, that's what I call the first unwholesome thought is the party pooper, right? So I mean, just keep getting your first Jhana completely strong, like you're like literally in first Jhana all the time. And then like, you can do other stuff, right? You can start to put some gaps in between those thoughts. So if you thought yourself into feeling so good, then it's kind of redundant to just keep thinking those thoughts that you're already feeling good about, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So you can just start to appreciate how good you're feeling without thinking about it. Okay. Yeah. And that would be the second Jhana. But the problem is, if you do that, and your first Jhana isn't strong enough, then you'll just go right back out of second Jhana back into the hindrances. So you have to train the mind's first jhana to be such a habit, like such a force of nature that when you go into second jhana, where you go back into is right back in the first jhana. Right? So you get a little taste of just feeling really good. And then when the thoughts come back up, the first thought that comes back up is wholesome. Yeah. So that's a practice. So it's not that there's not other things that to do or that will happen in the development of your practice is that the thinking, oh, there's something else that I should be doing, isn't it? It's an unwholesome thought. Because there's really nothing else that you should be doing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, just chilling.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, ultimately that's what you're doing is just chilling out. Like, it's the same thing in the beginning that it is in the end. Like, yeah, you're like, uh, it's just different progressions of Nibbana. So, uh, to get from hindrances into first Jhana, the hindrances have to have a cessation. Right. So in that sense, that's a sort of Nibbana to attain first Jhana. And there's all kinds of energy, wholesome thoughts that come along with that. Just because all the tension and all the mental bandwidth that you were dedicating to sorrow, lamentation, and despair, and thinking about the past and future, that tension has been released. So there's a real kind of outburst of Piti and Sukkha that comes along with that, and mindfulness, right? So, um, have you guys taken chemistry?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so like when, when a chemical bond, uh, is broken, it actually releases energy, right? Yeah, it does. So, so like a lot of people think it's, um, the opposite, like it takes energy to break the bond, right? But when the bond is broken, energy is released. So, so that, so that that tension being broken, the tension of any of the hindrances being broken actually releases energy. And that energy comes in the form of joy, enthusiasm, and then relaxation following that, right?

**Speaker C:** So And you get the feeling that you can do that, or I can do this. Of course you'd feel that way because you have more energy now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so like the Piti hit is like kind of like an I can do it type of energy. Like it's like a motivating type of energy of like, yeah, I'm on the right track essentially. Like this stuff works. The meditation is working. Wow, I'm actually gladdening my mind. That's kind of the Piti. And then the Sukkha is like, okay, now that I'm on the right track, and I feel really uplifted, I can kind of let go of some of those, some of those worries and tensions that are stored in my body, right, in the form of some kind of tension and in my chest or tension in my shoulders. And now I can like relax and experience like a pleasant, a pleasant abiding. So in the suttas, it says he experiences a pleasant abiding. And that's so it just means like your body's relaxed, right? Your body's feeling good. So we want to work on both of those with the wholesome thoughts. All right. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Thanks for that clarification because, yeah, I'll notice that that's the party pooper and then I'll be like, I see you too. And then it's just like, just rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah. The trick is there's like, there's a lot of party pooper thoughts that are kind of disguise themselves, right? Disguise themselves as thinking that you're practicing thoughts, right? Because like the party pooper thought in this case was like, is there anything else I should be doing with the practice? So that— so you might not immediately notice it as a party pooper thought. But like immediately following that thought, Yeah, Puja, you have something?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I was wondering if there's any way that you can incorporate that party pooper thought into it, like kind of get that guy to join the party in a way instead of like kicking him out. You know what I mean? I don't know if we should kick him out or join.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So like there's different ways we can skillfully navigate an unwholesome thought. But first we have to catch it. So it's not necessarily like you're trying super hard to kick out of it or get rid of it. You can just reframe it, right? Like, take that thought and be, oh, is there anything else I should be doing right now? Yeah, I should be thinking even more wholesome thought. And then, wow, back to feeling good. Yeah, I should be thinking how great— congratulations of how good my practice is going. And look at this fruit. So like, you can answer the question of, is there something else I should be doing with another wholesome thought? You know what I'm saying? Instead of compiling it with another unwholesome thought after that of, oh, is there something else I should be doing? Oh, maybe I'm not doing the right thing. And maybe, and then all that doubt, that doubt that you're practicing right starts to come in. Because it's really not the first unwholesome thought. It's one unwholesome thought doesn't take you out of it. One unwholesome thought doesn't take you out of Jhana. It's when it spirals, right? It's when it's one unwholesome thought creates another one, creates another one. And then before you know it, there's all these unwholesome thoughts that you can't really pick out the unwholesome from the wholesome, because all these unwholesome thoughts took you out of Jhana completely. And then now, now pretty much you're starting from out of Jhana, trying to get back into Jhana. Right? It's like the analogy of the swing. So it takes a little, it takes more effort to push the kid on the swing when it's going from a standstill. But once the swing is going back and forth, it just takes a little tap. So once you're already into a wholesome state of mind, once you're already in that good mood, that uplifted mood, all it takes is a little tap to keep it going. Like you don't really have to put much effort to like keep the swing going back and forth. Right. So, but then let's say we do get out of Jhana. We go back into hindrances. So the thoughts to think then is not, oh, fuck, I had it. Now I lost it. Now I'm back out of it. Now I'm going to have to do all this work. We go, oh, yippee, we get to learn how to get back into first Jhana again. So it's another opportunity for skill development. So getting from out of Jhana back into first Jhana is probably the best skill that needs developing. Staying in first Jhana isn't as hard, but getting back into it is like the main thing of the practice. Like that's probably like the— going from first Jhana to Nibbana really isn't that hard. It's just how good is your first jhana? So it's just that how— not that you've been in first jhana, how often can you be in first jhana? And how, like, literally how often can you be in first jhana? And how quickly can you get back into first jhana? Because then first jhana going to fruition, kind of just happens on its own, right? It's the same way you're gardening a plant. You can set the right causes and conditions. You can set the fertilizer, you can plant the seed, you can water the plant, you can make sure it's in a sunny spot, but there's nothing you can actually do to force that plant to sprout, flower, become pollinated, and bear fruit, right? You kind of just create the causes and conditions. So the causes and conditions for Nibbana to happen, or fruition of the Dharma to happen, is by development of first Jhana. So that's what you should be doing to answer your question. Okay. Yeah. But then is there any other questions?

**Speaker C:** I have a question. Or you can keep going. Me? All right.

**Speaker B:** Go ahead, Nick.

**Speaker C:** I heard Dhammarato say this before, and I feel like I kind of get it, but it doesn't really click like the rest of the things he says. But I heard that you were like talking with him, Scott, about the whole light bulb having its own consciousness, or the light switch. That little discussion, that seemed kind of to go over my head. I really quite understand.

**Speaker B:** To be honest, I didn't know what Dhammarato was talking about either. Sometimes Dhammarato will type stuff in the chat that like It doesn't really make sense, but like, I, I, that's just like him. Are you talking about one of the messages he typed in Skype?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, earlier today.

**Speaker B:** I didn't get the light bulb analogy. I wouldn't think about it too hard. Just like, take the, take the like sentiment behind it. Um, the thing he wrote about Let me check. The thing he wrote about, about something else was pretty important.

**Speaker C:** Existence is real or something. That part.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Inherent existence is real, just real, but inherent existence is not real. Inherent existence implies permanent, independent. Yeah, all things are interdependent and not permanent. Existence does not exist as a moving target. Nothing permanent, nothing independent. Yeah, so that's pretty important. So like, most people think that existence itself Even through the— hold on, I'm trying to figure out how to get the screen back. Okay, existence itself, like there is something inherently existing, it's just moving. It's like the now, right? People think that the now exists, it has inherent existence, like the present moment is inherently existing. And that's the only thing that inherently exists. And it's inherently existing from one moment to the next, when really the now has no inherent existence apart from its relationship to the past and the future. So it's not that anything inherently exists. It's just everything that exists exists, but it exists by causes and conditions. So it does not exist without causes and conditions. It does not exist without its relationships and dependency upon the proximate cause for its existence. And if you take away the proximate cause for its existence, it no longer exists. And that's the whole idea behind the Dharma. So if you take away The causes. If you take away the causes for suffering, suffering no longer arises. And if you put the causes for the end of suffering, the Eightfold Noble Path, then happiness arises, deliverance arises. So it's like, it's really simple teaching. It's really not like, it doesn't make any claims that are unfounded. So it's not saying like, it's not an absolute ontological existential viewpoint. The whole idea is to get rid of views. And just look at reality unfolding clearly. How it is. So you can see things without beyond a shadow of a doubt, the way that they are. And that's why attachment to views is actually one of the things that are gotten rid of. So your attachment to viewpoints, Right? All of that is replaced with right view. And right view isn't a noun, it's a verb. So it's actually a process of just looking, viewing reality as it happens. And then we could develop insight in that way.

**Speaker C:** Cleared it up a lot. Thanks. Well said.

**Speaker B:** Does anyone have any questions about that or anything to say? Okay. Yeah, but I picked a sutta that's a pretty popular sutta for today. You guys might have heard of it, the Sati Pitana Sutta. And in a way, this will answer Isaiah's question in the beginning of, is there anything else I can do? But then this is kind of like, this comes into handy once that first Jhana is really developed. Okay, because then once you are in first Jhana, There's different ways you can practice the Dhamma besides thinking a wholesome thought, right? You can direct your mindfulness or direct your attention towards certain aspects of your experience. So the actual 3 components of first Jhana is sometimes translated to the thinking and examining thought rather than the applied and sustained thought. Dhammarato says one wholesome thought after another. But another translation of the Pali, along with the Piti and Sukkha of first Jhana, is the thinking and examining thought. So you can be thinking and examining our experience. But instead of doing it as a kind of artificial, kind of try-hard practice, we're thinking and examining our experience because of the clarity of our interest for it. So we've already gotten out of the hindrances, we've already gotten out of the conceptual mind about the past and the future. So now we can take a look around at this interesting phenomena of human experience that's unfolding moment to moment. So with that, I'm just going to start the sutta here. All right, so this is MN 10, the Satipatthana Sutta, the Foundations of Mindfulness. And this is the sutta that a lot of the Vipassana people use, a lot of the mindfulness, a lot of the Western mindfulness people use. So a lot here is misunderstood by Dharma practitioners, and they're not really doing it right, and they're going nowhere fast. But I'm going to read it, so I'll kind of explain it for the world and YouTube so that they can actually practice it correctly. And Another thing is in the sutta, like towards the end, it says if you do this, if you actually do this right, like you will become an Arahant within a week or something. It might be a week or like 2 weeks. So it's a really powerful practice if you do it correctly. Thus have I heard, on one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Kuru country. At a town of the Kurus named Kamma Saddhamma. There he addressed the Bhikkhus thus. Bhikkhus. Venerable Sir, they replied. The Blessed One said this: Bhikkhus, this is the direct path for the purification of beings, for the surmounting of sorrow and lamentation, for the disappearance of pain and grief, for the attainment of the true way, for the realization of Nibbana, namely the four foundations of mindfulness. All right, so mindfulness is a really popular word. I want to ask you guys, like, what does mindfulness mean to you? Like, what does that mean?

**Speaker A:** I'd say waking up, taking a look.

**Speaker B:** That's okay. That's a good understanding. Anyone else?

**Speaker E:** Say for me, mindfulness is seeing things clearly.

**Speaker B:** Seeing things clearly as they are.

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So Oh, go ahead, Nick.

**Speaker C:** I was going to say seeing the mind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, seeing the mind. Yeah, so seeing the mind. Another good one. Mindfulness. Yeah, mindfulness. The word itself isn't exactly like— I don't think it really makes that much sense. Mindfulness. But it's a translation of Sati. Right? So Sati is essentially that kind of— that it's like that hit of remembrance. So if you— when I woke up this morning, 20 minutes before the Sangha call, and then I checked my phone and I go, oh crap, I have a Sangha call I have to do. So that was like a Sati. So Sati is like remembering to look. So remembering to look, remembering to practice. So you may be breathing and not aware that you're breathing. Sati would be the recognition that you are breathing. So it's not that you weren't breathing, but your mind didn't recognize it, didn't notice it. Wasn't mindful. So that's kind of what mindfulness means. Okay, so namely the four foundations of mindfulness. What are the four? Hear, Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu who abides contemplating the body as a body, hardened, fully aware and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the world. He abides contemplating. All right, so that's important. What are the four here? Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body, ardent, fully aware and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the world. So what that tells me is that this guy who's practicing Mindfulness is already in Jhana, right? Having put away grief and covetousness for the world. So people miss that part. So they practice mindfulness without putting away grief and covetousness for the world. So then the mindfulness will be obscured. So the mind will be distracted. The meditation will be done on behalf of a person who is grieving and suffering and a victim and trying to get rid of their suffering by practicing some kind of practice or mindfulness. So that would be grief. And so you have to get rid of grief and lamentation first. And then it's actually describing Jhana. Ardent, fully aware, and mindful. So that's a quality of Jhana. So first, Jhana actually comes with a quality of being fully aware, right? Wide awake. You're totally crystal clear awake to the moment. It's like someone throws a bucket of cold water in your face. Okay, you're going to wake up, right? You're going to be out of like the fog, the dullness, right? So this is why we emphasize first Jhana so much, so that we can do the practice of the Dhamma more effectively. All right, so abides contemplating the body as a body. And the wording is very important too. That's not really that complicated, right? Contemplating a body as a body. It's pretty simple, right? But it's a really powerful practice. So a lot of times, instead of contemplating our body as a body, either overtly or subconsciously, we think this is me. Right? We, there's no distinction between our body and what we consider me or mine. We could think, we could think this is me, or we could either think this is my body, right? Either one is ignorant. So really, it's just a body. So contemplating a body as a body, that this is a body, he abides contemplating feelings as feelings, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away grief and covetousness for the world. He abides contemplating mind as mind, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the world. He abides contemplating mind objects as mind objects, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the world. All right, so feelings as feelings, right? That's really important. So the feelings that we experience are just impersonal events. Okay. Normally there are feelings, right? So grief, lamentation, sorrow, and despair usually comes with a strong sense of self behind it. Oh, how could this person have wronged me? Oh, how bad this thing that happened to me. And why is it always— why does this always happen to me? And oh, I'm always doing this. I always fuck it up or something to that extent. When you're grieving and you're lamenting, it's always your grief and lamentation. Instead of just looking at feelings as feelings, right? Just the same way our body is a body. It is what it is. A feeling is just a feeling. It's arising impersonally, just like the weather. Okay. And that's important for when we're actually in Jhana too. So when we are experiencing good feelings, We're just observing the feelings without a personal attachment to them. So even when you're experiencing really good feelings, those feelings are just feelings, right? Normally we go, oh, yippee, these are my feelings, my Jhana. And that's usually a quick way to get out of it. Yeah, so you're just, it's better just to sit back and let it unfold. And just observe it mindfully for what it is. And then mind is mind. So mind is mind is essentially seeing a thought as a thought. So even more tricky than probably body is body is seeing thoughts as thoughts without thinking that our thoughts are me. So it's probably more, it's easier to recognize this body is just a body, right? If someone chops off your hand, is that hand still yours? Like you'd still be here, but your hand would be gone, right? It wouldn't really be your hand anymore, right? And the same for the rest of the body. But A thought is a little more tricky. Like, most people walking around in the world are fully convinced that they are their thoughts, right? The discursive thought going on, thinking about things through the English language or whatever language that you speak, we're convinced that that's me, instead of seeing that it's just a phenomenal, independently originated event that's happening, that we aren't really in as much control of as we think we are. Right? Thoughts are just happening.

**Speaker E:** Hey, Scott.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** What's the name of the sutta called again?

**Speaker B:** Sati Pitana Sutta. It's just MN 10.

**Speaker E:** Okay. What website was it? I just want to follow along as you're reading it.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I just go on the Bhikkhu Bodhisattva MN PDF. Okay, and it's just the Middle Length Discourses, and you're just gonna have to scroll down. But yeah, I'll continue. I'm taking a long time with the beginning of it here. I don't think we're gonna get through the whole thing today. It's kind of a long sutta, but we can take our time. Okay, so contemplating mind is mind, and then mind objects is mind objects. Mind objects would be the things that you're thinking about, right? So mind would be the process of thinking itself, and mind objects would be what are you thinking about. And really, without mind objects, there is no mind, and without mind, there is no mind objects. So thoughts don't arise unless you're thinking about something in particular. So a thought has to have those two components. So let's say I'm thinking about my ex-girlfriend, right? The mind would be the process of thinking, and the mind object would be the imaginary ex-girlfriend that I construct in my mind that I'm thinking about. Right? It's a mind object. But normally we think, that's my ex-girlfriend. That's who she really is that I'm thinking about. But that's not her. That's just something that I'm constructing, right? It's a mind object. So pretty much anything that you think about the past, instead of actually being the real thing that happened in the past, It's really just a mental construction. It's a mind object that you're thinking about. If I'm thinking about a table, right, I can imagine a table. That's a mind object. So a mind object could be in the form of a thought. It could also be mental imagery, right? It doesn't necessarily have to be like in the form of language. Thoughts also take the form of images. And depending on the type of person you are, you might, you may have more of an image, like if you're an artist or something, you may think more in images than you do in discursive language and logic. But both of these are mind, right? They're not based on any of the senses. All right. So the mind and the mind objects is one of the six sense bases. So for the Buddha, it's categorized the same as seeing, seeing something literally. So the eye comes into contact with the forms that it sees in the same way that the mind comes into contact with the mind objects that it thinks about. So in the same way, it's a sense faculty. Our mind, our sight, our touch, our taste, our hearing, it's all part of the sixth sense basis. Okay, so those are the four foundations of mindfulness. And then the next heading, it gets on to contemplation of the body, and it starts with mindfulness of breathing. And how, Bhikkhus, does a Bhikkhu abide contemplating the body as a body? Here a Bhikkhu, gone to the forest, or to a root of a tree, or to an empty hut, sits down. It says having folded his legs and blah, blah, blah. But I think Dhammarato talked about this. It's not like the right translation. You could just be sitting down. It doesn't— you don't have to be in full lotus or whatever. And established mindfulness in front of him. Ever mindful, he breathes in. Mindful, he breathes out. Breathing in long, he understands, I breathe in long. Or breathing out long, he understands, I breathe out long. Breathing in short, he understands, I breathe in short. Or breathing out short, he understands, I breathe out short. He trains thus: I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body. So I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body. He trains thus. I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body. He trains thus. I shall breathe in tranquilizing the bodily formation. He trains thus. I shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily formation. Just as a skilled turner or his apprentice when making a long turn understands, I make a long turn Or when making a short turn, understands, I make a short turn. So too, breathing in long, a Bhikkhu understands, I breathe in long. He trains thus, I shall breathe out, tranquilizing the bodily formation. All right.

**Speaker E:** Is the bodily formation just the body? Another word for the body?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's a Sensations of the body. So tranquilizing the bodily formation just means relaxing the body. That's all it means. I don't know why they translated like that, but that's literally what it means. So yeah, you first recognize how are we breathing, right? Am I breathing in short or breathing in long? And then so you'll either understand that you're breathing in short or understand that you're breathing in long. All right, that's pretty straightforward. It doesn't say anything about the tip of the nostril. It doesn't say anything about all kinds of breathing meditations that are taught in Western Dharma. It just says breathing in long. I understand I breathe in long. So just the Sati, the mindfulness of our breathing itself, how are we breathing, is the practice. And then you breathe in. The next step is breathing in, experiencing the whole body. So now that we brought the mind's attention to the breath, we've collected the mind to the breath is kind of sensation happening in the body. So now we can bring the mind to the experience of our whole body simultaneously. So what is the posture of our body? What does our body feel like? How does it feel like for the shirt to be touching your skin right now? And as you breathe, what do those little sensations feel like changing all around your body, all on your skin, from your head to your toes, from the sensation of your butt against the seat the little sensations of the fabric moving against your skin as you breathe. You kind of just breathe and experience the whole body, right? And what's the next step? If you find any tensions in your body, You can take, take, continue with the nice breaths that you're taking, and just relax and let go of those tensions. Because a relaxed body is a relaxed mind, right? So having put away grief and covetousness for the world, We stop creating tensions in the body with our mind. And so now the tensions that are still there are already there. We can breathe, become aware of them, and then consciously relax them because we're no longer creating them mentally anymore. And what is relaxing the body do? Well, that just creates more Sukkha, right? So that's just strengthening the Jhana that we're already in. Right? So when you are in Jhana, and you're thinking, what should I do? Well, you can breathe, become aware of your body, relax any tensions that are going on. And then start to enjoy that relief and that pleasantness of your body. And how good does it actually feel? It now goes on to the insight. In this way, he abides contemplating the body as a body internally, or he abides contemplating the body as a body externally. Or he abides contemplating the body as a body, both internally and externally. Or else he abides contemplating in the body its arising factors. Or he abides contemplating in the body its vanishing factors. Or he abides contemplating in the body both its arising and vanishing factors. Or else mindfulness that there is a body is simply established in him to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and mindfulness, and he abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world. That is how a Bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body. All right, so Abides contemplating the body as a body externally. So there's certain parts of our body that are kind of external, right? The external sensations of the body. But there may be more internal sensations of the body, like maybe a feeling in your stomach or something like that. Or a feeling that's in your heart, in your chest, that may not be as external as the feeling of your foot against the ground. The next one, he abides contemplating the body and its arising factors. So you're actually Now that you're in a clear state of mindfulness, and you're staying with the sensations of your body, you're staying with the sensations of your breath, you can actually see that these sensations are arising and vanishing. So the sensation, in other words, the sensations of our body are changing from moment to moment. It's not as if the body is a solid thing that isn't shifting and changing and appearing and disappearing. All the sensations of our body are appearing and disappearing. And then a cool thing is if you can actually appreciate the moments it appears and the moments it disappears in the visceral sensations, you can actually get a taste of that emptiness. Oh wow, there isn't really a solid thing that's me known as a body, but there's just appearing and disappearing sensations. And you can appreciate some gaps in between those sensations even. So that just adds to the relief, right? That reveals their emptiness, their inherent non-existence. Or their inherent dependent existence is another way to put it. And then, or mindfulness that there is a body is simply established in him to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and mindfulness. All right, so that's enough. Just the disidentification from going from this is my body to there is a body, just for the bare extent of mindfulness, so you don't get caught by identifying with it. That's also enough. So you don't even need to see it arising and vanishing. You could just be aware that there is a body here, and that would be sufficient. The Four Postures. Again, Bhikkhus, when walking, a Bhikkhu understands, I am walking. When standing, he understands, I am standing. When sitting, he understands, I am sitting. When lying down, he understands, I am lying down. Or he understands accordingly, however his body is disposed. In this way, he abides contemplating the body as a body, internally, externally, and both internally and externally. And he abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world. That too is how Bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body. All right. So whatever posture your body is in, that could be used as a tool for Sati. So what is my body doing right now? Oh, it's sitting. I'm sitting. Or am I standing? I'm standing. Or am I walking? Okay, I'm walking. Am I lying down? I'm lying down. Right? So throughout the day, whatever our body is doing, we can become aware of what it is doing instead of just having it do that ignorantly. So these are all like Sati reminders, right? Full awareness. Again, Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu is one who acts in full awareness when going forward and returning. Who acts in full awareness when looking ahead and looking away, who acts in full awareness when flexing and extending his limbs, who acts in full awareness when wearing his robes and carrying his outer robe and bowl, who acts in full awareness when eating, drinking, consuming food, and tasting, who acts in full awareness when defecating and urinating, He acts in full awareness when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, and keeping silent. In this way, he abides contemplating the body as a body, etc., etc. Right, so to be fully aware of what our body is doing at any given moment is also another thing that is wholesome. So you can continue with keeping the mind in a wholesome state that way. Right? So if I reach out to grab this cup, just the act of instead of just like doing it habitually, like I already know how to grab the cup. So I'm just going to grab the cup and drink, right? But what if I mindfully grab the cup? And I'm aware of the act of actually going out there and grabbing that cup, right? Or I mindfully get up from my seat. I mindfully drive, right? I'm aware of each little movement that I'm doing, right? So this is what it's talking about. It's a skill of all the things that we do. Sort of on autopilot. We're going to take the mind out of autopilot mode and then bring it into manually doing things. Because what all of our Dukkha is actually created is on autopilot, right? It's the habitual tendencies of our mind that are creating our Dukkha for us. So the more we take the mind out of autopilot mode, into fully aware mode, fully mindful mode of what is going on here in this moment, right? What is my body doing in this moment? That's all the less bandwidth that your mind can be grieving, lamenting, sorrow, and despairing about the past and imagining things that aren't here right now, right? That make us suffer. Okay, this one. I'm gonna be right back. I'm gonna get some more water and I need to blow my nose. But feel free to talk amongst each other while I'm gone.

**Speaker D:** I was gonna ask Scott, like, if someone happens to be addicted to something, And do you think it would help to, like, do that thing while you're— I don't know if anyone's listening, but while you're— okay. Yeah. So, like, do that thing with more awareness, I guess. Like, say if you're a smoker and you're trying to quit, like, instead of habitually grabbing a cigarette, you can put more awareness behind it. And, you know, maybe you can feel the damage that it's doing or something, and somehow that could help you quit that habit.

**Speaker C:** I don't know, probably have the habit of smoking cigarettes because— not because it's good, for some other reason, like it's a crutch. So once you start seeing that, then you can see it for what it is, crutch.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's actually— I was gonna.

**Speaker D:** Say that that's a really good helpful thing because, uh, can help a lot of people quit stuff that they're addicted to.

**Speaker C:** Dhammarato has an interesting story about a chocolate bar, her addiction. Talks about how At every point you could put the chocolate bar down. When you go to the fridge and you pick the chocolate bar up, you could put it down. When you unwrap it and it's here, you could put it down. When it's in your mouth, you could even spit it out. You could take a few chews, put it out. So there's all these little moments of Sati that you could use to wake up and decide that you're gonna not let this addiction take control of your happiness.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I noticed that too, because I'm trying to quit something myself right now. I smoke weed too much, and I'm trying to quit. And I noticed that when I think about every little thing that I do, like in the routine of smoking weed, I I'm less— I don't even want to smoke it by the end of the thing. I'm more like, okay, I'm just going to relax. I'm already relaxing right now and I'm going to keep relaxing. And yeah, so I noticed that myself too.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So the weed addiction is like, it's a psychological addiction because like weed itself isn't really like physically addicted. So the reason why you keep smoking weed, not that there's anything wrong with smoking weed, but if you smoke weed too much, it's because there's that psychological thing, reason why you're trying to solve that unpleasant sensation with the weed. And the thing is, It may work, but smoking so much, eventually it won't work as well. So even let's say you do decide to smoke and then you do actually smoke, be mindful. Am I actually enjoying this high? Like, what is this high like? Experience the high fully. Like, be mindful of the actual experience. Instead of just taking it for granted, the smoking, and then going about doing whatever you're doing. Like, it's a habit, so be mindful. Oh, and then you might notice something. Oh, actually, this high isn't as enjoyable as it used to be, or how it is when I don't smoke all the time, right? So then that, that can— that just being aware, it's not that you need to like stop doing it or force yourself to stop doing it, but just be aware of what is it like to do it, right? Because then that will give you experiential insight that you may say, oh, I don't want to do this anymore, right? You might just like realize that.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, you hit the nail on the head. And yeah, the thing that Dhammarato always says is like, stop making so many rules for yourself. Before, when I was trying to quit weed, I would make it like a really strict rule that I can't smoke weed for this amount of time or whatever. And now I'm more just relaxed about it, and I really feel the addiction starting to disintegrate. So it's really nice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, perfect. Yeah, normally the way people overcome addictions is they become disenchanted with the drug, right? They realize, oh, this isn't giving me the happiness that I'm actually using it for. And it's not as enjoyable as it was. So I'm going to stop doing it, or at least cut back on doing it. So, but that can only— but that's why mindfulness is so important, because we won't actually come to realize the result of our actions unless we're paying attention to what's going on as it goes on. Right. We'll just kind of be in a fog of being high and then we'll continue doing whatever we were doing before without seeing that the weed itself isn't making the situation any better. Yeah. Yeah, go ahead.

**Speaker E:** Go ahead, Scott.

**Speaker B:** No, I don't know. Go ahead.

**Speaker E:** Okay. Puja, is that how you say your name, friend?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, that's exactly right.

**Speaker E:** Okay, cool, cool. You're just speaking. You're just speaking my language over here when you talk about the weed and stuff.

**Speaker B:** I think literally everyone in this call is a fucking major pothead. I know Nick is. Nixon, but the weed.

**Speaker A:** Sucks.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, so this is very valuable. I was going through this actually a couple months ago where I actually found incredible benefit from using weed with my job. I noticed I was in sales and I was booking 2 times the amount of meetings that I usually book being in sales when I took a dab. Before my cold calls. And, what that turned into was taking dabs before going on dates and then taking dabs before I go see my family. And so, I was taking 6 to 7 dabs a day. And, at some point, I started to realize the heaviness of that of like, "Oh, wow, I have to go back to the dab. I have to clean it. I have to take more.

**Speaker C:** I have to—".

**Speaker E:** Pay more, right? It costs money. But it's kind of like what Scott and Nick said. I feel like if you're just paying attention, and it just takes one time of noticing, okay, I got high, but I don't feel as good as I thought I would. Okay, that's interesting.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker E:** And it's kind of like keeping this judgmentalist attitude about it all, right? Like, Give yourself free rein. That's what I did. I mean, it might work for some, might not, I don't know. But I decided to go for it and just do 6 to 7 dabs a day. But little by little, I have taken that down. So it went from like the next week, it went to 5 dabs. The next week after that, it went to 4 and then 3 and then 2. And now it's like 0 to 1 dabs a day. And I noticed I prefer that more. And it just happened from seeing what I didn't like about the experience while being high, or, you know, the fact that it was heavier, or, you know, even like physical things, right? Like, I don't know if you guys feel this, but if I take 6 to 7 dabs, I start feeling it in my head and my body, and I feel stuffy. And it's like, this is And I'm like watching a movie. I'm like so excited to watch this movie high. And I'm like not even paying attention to the movie because this congestion in my face is like way too much.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So it's just like— Yeah, if you're like mindful of your actual body, you'll see that like smoking way too much is actually going to make a lot of dullness.

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** It's going to bring about a lot of like hindrances. And smoking a little weed here and there to just chill out and relax, that's different because then, you know, but if you smoke all the time, it's gonna, it's kind of gonna deplete your energy and your, your, your mind won't be as sharp, right? Your, your mind isn't going to be as clear, right? You're not going to be able to discern things as quickly and see as clearly. Which is important for mindfulness.

**Speaker E:** And I think maybe the advantage that we have as practitioners over someone that might not be familiar with the Dharma like we are is because we have this other thing, this wholesome quality, this wholesome practice that has given us evidence that we can feel good without weed. And so the fact that we have even a glimpse of that, we know that there's this this other thing. So it's like, okay, it's just a matter of time. We're gradually using other things less and less to be okay. Yeah, someone that doesn't have access to the Dharma might be— I don't know, I kind of think back to the time when I used to smoke and I didn't even know anything about the Dharma. I would just smoke and smoke and smoke and smoke, and we would still see those hindrances and those unwholesome qualities, but we would just we wouldn't— we'd be ignorant about it. There's nothing we can do about it because we don't know the Dharma. So I'm just like, oh, well, let's get high again. But like, you just come to realize, okay, it just doesn't feel good.

**Speaker B:** You can get high, you can, you know, like, actually getting into Jhana and getting into these states is, um, it's like getting high. But I would say it's like— I would say first Jhana is closer to a cocaine high than it is like a like a weed high. You know, it kind of wakes you right up. Okay, so I can't. So first, Jhana, it gets you feeling alive. It gets you feeling good to be alive, right? This is why people— this is why Charlie Sheen does cocaine, right? So we're doing the same thing, but we can actually get ourselves into that state. With the power of our own mind, which is fucking amazing. So highly, highly recommend, you know, these types of thoughts of how good does it actually feel to be alive and like, wow, I'm alive right now. Look at this experience. Isn't this amazing? Right? All of this. I mean, you might feel this if you go to some like national park and like you see some huge like waterfall or some magnificent, magnificent landscape, you might have that moment of, wow, I'm alive right now. I'm really, I'm in the thick of nature. I'm like an Anagami, like I'm an animal, just completely in the moment. And this moment is invigorating, right? So these are the kinds of mind states that intentionally we're trying to evoke with the practice.

**Speaker D:** I was going to say, Scott, do you see a distinction in like telling yourself that and actually feeling that? Like, you know what I'm trying to say? Like, I might just say right now, oh, it feels so great to feel alive, but there's some times where I just, I feel that naturally, you know. It's just I'm kind of just saying it in my own head Naturally.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So the thing is, like, when it happens naturally, that's a more authentic version of it. Right. But what we're trying to do is trying to create the conditions for it to happen naturally more often. Right. So yeah, it's not— this experience isn't really foreign to anyone. It's just that us who practice the Dharma get to enjoy it more, right? Everyone has experienced moments of feeling alive, right? And when it does happen naturally, it just kind of comes over you, right? So what we're going to do is actually make sure the mind is wholesome and pure so that this kind of feeling can come over us more. Right? Because what takes us out of this feeling is a lot of the unwholesome activity of our mind that we, an untrained mind, just lets go by and like kind of allows all these kinds of thoughts that actually make shitty feelings come over us go by. So if we, if If we get rid of those thoughts, it's not that we have to artificially create the experience of being alive. We are alive, right? So if we get rid of all the shit that's distracting us from being alive, we can enjoy it more. So I'm not— so, you know, that's the main pitfall of this practice is that people can think it's like an artificial thing. Like, oh, we're like faking it, right? But no, we're just creating the condition. We're creating the conditions for it to happen. Like, for instance, you're going to have a girl over to your room. Like, are you going to want to clean your room for that girl to come over, or you're going to leave all this shit around it, right? Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Creating the conditions.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So like, if you can like create the, like a nice environment, nice room, it's not going to make necessarily that girl come into your room. But like, we want to get the mind nice and clean, nice and uncluttered. And then that— even the body, like.

**Speaker D:** The health and everything that can help the body.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So eat healthy, get enough like movement. Like, what I mean, walking is exercise. A lot of times if we feel dull and like lethargic, well, what did you do all day? Did you move at all? Right. So like a lot of times what creates energy is literally just going for a walk, go for a walk for an hour. And that will brighten up the mind that will start to energize things. So, so yeah, creating the right conditions for the 6 experience to come over us. And then it's going to happen more. So those good feelings are going to come more. And then, yeah, how much can you really lay it on? So when those good feelings do come over you, you kind of just, you stoke, you add more fuel to the fire, right? Instead of like having those good feelings come over and then Oh shit, I gotta do something tomorrow, or what about this, or like that first unwholesome thought that poops the party. We want to avoid those by just really laying it on of how good does it actually feel right now. And ah, this is amazing. So the good feelings aren't artificial, but we can keep the good feelings going. By just like, but by, it's like, you know, like, it's like you hype up. If you like, hype up a dog, right? You, how do you like get a dog really excited? You're like, oh yeah, doggy. And you're like, you get, you come at it with all this energy and like you give it all this like pets and stuff and the dog will just start jumping around and be all excited. So like, we do the same thing with the feelings, right? So we just, we hype them up with like even more wholesome thoughts, like even more, like even better wholesome thoughts. And then you can experience even better states of consciousness. So it's like, you just kind of want to keep that ball, it snowballs, you You want to keep that snowball rolling. Okay, so I think that was good for today. We barely scratched the surface of it, but we've been going for like an hour and 10 minutes now. So unless there's any— is there any other questions?

**Speaker E:** I like that sutta a lot, Scott. Thank you. I got a different understanding of how to bring the mind into a wholesome condition today.

**Speaker B:** So perfect.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, man.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, thanks for coming, dude. And, uh, we'll continue off, uh, where we left off next week, um, because I didn't really get far into it. Um, yeah, but thanks everyone for coming. It was, it was good to see you, Alex. Uh, good to see you, Puja. Uh, nice to meet you.

**Speaker D:** Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Meet you, Puja. Thanks for coming. Nick, do you have any closing words?

**Speaker C:** Have lots of fun, boys. Good time.

**Speaker B:** All right, all right. Good to see everyone. All right, see you boys next time.

**Speaker C:** Bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key teachings and discussion points:

### **Core Theme:** Cultivating and Sustaining Wholesome States (Jhana)
The talk centers on moving from a state of hindrances (worries, doubts, distractions) into a sustained, joyful, and relaxed state of mind (Jhana) through skillful use of wholesome thoughts.

### **Main Teachings:**

1.  **The "Party Pooper" Thought:** A primary obstacle in meditation is the doubting, meta-thought that asks, *"Is there something else I should be doing?"* or *"Am I doing this right?"* This is identified as the **first unwholesome thought** that can spiral and pull you out of a good meditative state.

2.  **The Practice: Think Your Way to Feeling Good:** The initial practice is to actively use **wholesome thoughts** to gladden the mind and create a feeling of well-being (e.g., appreciating being alive, feeling good). This builds the "first jhana."

3.  **Strengthening First Jhana:** The goal is to make first jhana so strong and habitual that it becomes your mind's default "home base." From this stable, joyful, and energetic state (characterized by *piti* - joy/enthusiasm and *sukkha* - happiness/relaxation), further practice becomes possible.

4.  **The Progression:** Once first jhana is strong, you can:
    *   Move towards **second jhana**: Appreciating the good feeling without continuous verbal thought, simply abiding in it.
    *   Skillfully navigate unwholesome thoughts by **reframing them** (e.g., answering "Is there something else to do?" with "Yes, think another wholesome thought!").
    *   The most important skill is **quickly returning to first jhana** after losing it, seeing it as an opportunity for practice, not a failure.

5.  **Mindfulness (*Sati*) in the Right Context:** The group discusses the **Satipatthana Sutta** (Foundations of Mindfulness). A crucial, often-missed point is that true mindfulness practice is done **after** "having put away covetousness and grief for the world"—that is, from a base of jhana or a wholesome, settled mind. Mindfulness then becomes a clear looking at:
    *   **The body as a body** (not "me" or "mine").
    *   **Feelings as feelings** (impersonal events like weather).
    *   **Mind as mind** (thoughts as just thoughts, not "me").
    *   **Mind-objects as mind-objects** (mental constructs).

6.  **Application in Daily Life & Overcoming Habits:**
    *   Mindfulness can be applied to all activities (walking, eating, reaching for a cup) to take the mind off "autopilot" and reduce the bandwidth available for suffering.
    *   This mindful awareness is also the key to working with addictions (e.g., smoking weed). By **paying full attention to the actual experience** of the addictive habit, one naturally becomes disenchanted as its drawbacks and diminishing returns become clear, without needing harsh self-rules.

### **Key Analogies & Explanations:**
*   **The Swing:** It takes effort to start a swing from rest, but only a small tap to keep it going. Similarly, it takes effort to get into jhana, but less to sustain it.
*   **Gardening:** You create the causes and conditions (water, sun, soil) for a plant to grow, but you can't force the fruit. Similarly, you create the causes (strong first jhana) for enlightenment (Nibbana), and the fruit ripens on its own.
*   **Chemical Bond:** Breaking the bond of a hindrance (like worry) **releases energy**, which manifests as joy (*piti*) and relief (*sukkha*).
*   **Cleaning the Room:** You clean your room (purify the mind) to create a pleasant condition for a guest (wholesome states) to arrive, but you don't force the guest to come.

### **Conclusion:**
The path emphasized is one of **cultivation**, not forced striving. By diligently and gently replacing unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones, one builds a foundation of joy and clarity (first jhana). From that foundation, deeper mindfulness, insight into the impersonal nature of experience, and the abandonment of harmful habits arise naturally. The entire approach is framed in a relaxed, encouraging, and practical tone.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Scott, Speaker B) uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain meditation concepts, particularly related to Jhana states, mindfulness, and dealing with unwholesome thoughts. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **1. The “Party Pooper” Thought**
- **Metaphor**: The first unwholesome thought (e.g., “Is there something else I should be doing?”) is compared to a **“party pooper.”**
- **Purpose**: Illustrates how doubt or overthinking can disrupt a wholesome, joyful state of mind (Jhana). The goal is to recognize and not let that thought “spoil the party.”

---

### **2. The Swing Analogy**
- **Metaphor**: Getting into a wholesome state of mind is like pushing a swing.  
  - **From a standstill**: It takes effort to start.  
  - **Once swinging**: Only a small tap is needed to keep it going.
- **Purpose**: Emphasizes that maintaining a wholesome state is easier once established, and returning to it after losing it requires skill (like restarting the swing).

---

### **3. Chemical Bond Energy Release**
- **Metaphor**: Breaking free from hindrances (like worry, tension) is compared to **breaking a chemical bond**, which **releases energy**.
- **Purpose**: Explains the surge of joy (*piti*) and pleasure (*sukkha*) in meditation—not as something you “build” but as energy released when mental tension ceases.

---

### **4. Gardening / Plant Growth**
- **Metaphor**: Meditation progress is like **gardening a plant**.  
  - You create causes and conditions (soil, water, sunlight).  
  - You can’t force the plant to sprout or bear fruit—it happens naturally when conditions are right.
- **Purpose**: Highlights that deepening meditation (e.g., reaching Nibbana) isn’t about forcing outcomes but cultivating the right conditions (strong first Jhana).

---

### **5. Light Switch / Light Bulb (Referenced but not fully explained)**
- **Mentioned briefly** in a question from another speaker about Dhammarato’s analogy. Scott admits he didn’t fully grasp it but relates it to the idea of **dependent existence** (nothing exists independently, like a light bulb needing electricity).

---

### **6. Dog Hype Analogy**
- **Metaphor**: Cultivating joyful states is like **hyping up a dog**—you use enthusiastic energy (wholesome thoughts) to amplify excitement and joy.
- **Purpose**: Shows how to “stoke the fire” of good feelings in meditation by adding more wholesome attention, not just passively observing.

---

### **7. Addiction and Mindfulness (Implicit story)**
- **Story/Narrative**: Several speakers share experiences with weed addiction and how **mindfulness**—paying close attention to the actual experience of being high—naturally leads to disenchantment and reduced use.
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates how mindful observation (rather than strict rules) can transform habits by revealing their true effects.

---

### **8. The Skilled Turner (from the Sutta)**
- **Metaphor**: In the Satipatthana Sutta, mindfulness of breathing is compared to a **skilled turner** who knows exactly whether they are making a long or short turn.
- **Purpose**: Illustrates precise, present-moment awareness in meditation—knowing the breath naturally, without forcing.

---

### **9. Cleaning Your Room for a Guest**
- **Metaphor**: Preparing the mind for wholesome states is like **cleaning your room before a guest arrives**.  
  - You create a welcoming environment, but you don’t “make” the guest come.
- **Purpose**: Emphasizes creating conditions for good states (through wholesome thoughts, relaxation, etc.) rather than manufacturing them artificially.

---

### **10. Chocolate Bar Story (Referenced)**
- **Story**: Dhammarato’s example of eating a chocolate bar—at any point (picking it up, unwrapping it, chewing), you can **pause and choose to stop**.
- **Purpose**: Teaches that mindfulness offers multiple opportunities to interrupt habitual patterns (like addiction).

---

### **Key Themes in the Metaphors:**
- **Recognition vs. Suppression**: Notice unwholesome thoughts without fighting them (e.g., “invite the party pooper to join the party” by reframing).
- **Natural Unfolding**: Progress in meditation is organic, like gardening or a swinging pendulum.
- **Energy Transformation**: Release of mental tension fuels joy.
- **Skillful Conditioning**: Creating the right mental environment for wholesome states to arise.

These metaphors make abstract meditation concepts relatable and practical, emphasizing **awareness, patience, and skillful cultivation** over forced effort.
