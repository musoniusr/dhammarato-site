### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, hello everybody and welcome to the Sunday UK Sangha. And I will be hosting the call today as Dhammarato is still recovering. But before we start, he would like to share a message. So go ahead, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** All right, thank you so much. In fact, I would like to thank you all. This has been, for the past 8 years, we have been developing the Sangha, and that I wanted to send the message that even though I'm in recovery, the mind is still foggy, in a cloud, and that I won't be I will actually, to say it correctly, is that I will be slow coming back. But this is actually an opportunity, and I would like to share that opportunity with you so that each one of you will gain more value in the Dharma by spending more time in the Dharma. Especially with each other, that the Dharma is not really Dharma without the Sangha. And so we've got a new group called One-on-One Dharma Calls, and that I would like for that group to be used actively for two primary reasons. One is that we still have a lot of new students coming on, and that they need a little bit of guidance beyond what I'm able to give. And so what I would recommend is that all the people who have been around and sharing the Dharma for the past 2 years or so, or even less, to please take up that slack and to start calling some of these new people that are on the group and to share your Dharma with them, knowing that the best way— I've seen it in the suttas and I've experienced it myself— the best way to learn the Dharma, the best way to start living the Dharma, is to start sharing and telling other people about the Dharma. That will help clarify it for you, in your own mind. And I would like to see you doing that on both Skype and also the website is pretty well stable now. We have friends, we'll have groups, you can share Suttas, you can share PDF files, you can share your own ideas, and there's also a field called "Tell us about your practice." this would be a good place for you to start keeping a bit of a journal to start tracking your practice. And so I would invite each and every one of you to start doing this. Now, I don't see the guy now, maybe he's moved on or turned his video off, but let me answer one question. That was asked before, and then you guys can discuss it with Daniel's guidance. Daniel's been around for a long time, and I really trust him in the Dharma. But one guy had asked about concentration, and the thing that we could say to concentrate on is to concentrate on having good wholesome thoughts. That we don't take a particular object like a sphere or a third eye or a crystal or water gazing or any of that kind of stuff on the outside. Those are the old things. That what the Buddha taught was to start looking at what your mind is doing and start making changes to the mind. Now also, one more point is that Dietrich had asked about the difference between the inside and the outside. And the easy answer to that is, you've heard about being, let us say, if you take care of this moment, moment by moment, the future will take care of itself. And if you take care of your mind moment by moment, the outside world will take care of itself. You don't need to be concerned about the outside. What you need to be is concerned about how you respond to the outside world. And so this is what the practice is really all about. And to respond to each other, to teach each other, to share the Dharma, and to be awake and aware of what's happening around you, rather than being, let us say, affected by what surrounds you. That in fact, when you're affected by what surrounds you, that's the same thing as being infected. By what surrounds you. So don't let your surroundings control you. Rather, you control your own mind so that you can have your own happiness and gain great benefit from the Dharma. So with that as my message, I would like to hand it back to Daniel and also to say to each one of you, thank you so much for being my friend. I really enjoy that. I enjoy having so many friends. Thank you for staying in the Dhamma. Thank you for not abandoning the Dharma. Thank you for continuing with the Sangha, and that I hope that I'll be back in time so that the Sangha doesn't die altogether, but that you guys can keep it together for me. So thank you all. Daniel, I'll turn it back over to you now.

**Speaker A:** Thank you so much, Dhammarato. So to start and give my personal experience with sharing the Dharma is about half a year ago I went on a retreat with the son of Deirdre and Yeah, he had asked me to help him clarify some points about the Dharma. And when I started preparing that, when I started talking to him about the Dharma, yeah, I can really say that it helped, really helped me to clarify what I had to do for myself in that particular retreat. So yeah, it really is true that teaching the Dhamma really helps your own practice. And yeah, for the next point, Alejandro, I actually had a screenshot of a sutta already in my photos because I thought it was such an interesting explanation on concentration, and I never saw it so clearly explained in any sutta as in this sutta. So I will read a small excerpt from this sutta. It's in the Majjhima Nikaya, and there is a Bhikkhuni called Dhammadina, and she is asked about concentration. And maybe a better word is a unification of mind. So the question goes, Lady, what is Yeah, what is Samadhi? What is the basis of Samadhi? What is the equipment of Samadhi? What is the development of Samadhi? And here she answers: Unification of mind, friend Visaka, is Samadhi. So unification of mind means gathering the factors, gathering the factors of the first Jhana, gathering the joy, gathering the feeling of success, applying the minds to the wholesome, sustaining the minds on the wholesome. And also one other factor that we discussed in a Sangha call not too long ago is One Go, or Ekagata, and it usually gets translated as one-pointedness. But Dhammarato says this is an incorrect translation, and a better translation is One Go, which means to go directly to the wholesome. Don't skip any step, just cool down right now. So gathering together these factors, that is unification of mind. But there's more to say about this. What is the basis of Samadhi? What is it built on? And that is we gather these factors based on the four foundations of Sati, of mindfulness. So we gather these factors on the body, we look for the wholesome in the body, we sustain on what is wholesome in the body, we find joy, we find, for example, comfort in the body, we find success in relaxing the body, and we go directly to the wholesome in the body. And we do that also with the other foundations of mindfulness. So we do it for the thoughts, we do it for the mental attitudes, and we also do it for the feelings. So those are the bases of concentration. So those are the things that we can sense, the things that we can see, that we develop these factors on. And then the sutta goes on to talk about the Four Right Efforts. And the Four Right Efforts are the four ways in which we develop these wholesome states. So the first we can look at is abandoning whatever unwholesome state has arisen in us. If we see any unwholesome feeling, then we will start by abandoning whatever unwholesome feeling has arisen in us. And then when we have abandoned it then we go on to preventing them from arising in the first place. So how can we prevent unwholesome states from arising in the first place? Well, that's by having wholesome thoughts. Everything's all right already, everything's okay. And yeah, we've heard many, many examples on these calls. So we want to give our minds something to do, because if we give our minds a wholesome task to do, then it cannot be in the unwholesome, because the mind can only do one thing at a time. And this is why it's so important to keep applying, keep sustaining the mind on the wholesome. So that's how we concentrate or unify our minds, yeah, on this right effort. So we've covered the two ways of abandoning and preventing the unwholesome states, and then we also have two ways to develop wholesome states, and that is by first by applying our minds to the wholesome. So yeah, just starting to have wholesome thoughts. Everything's all right, everything's okay. We've got nothing to do, nowhere to go. We can just listen to this Dhamma call altogether happily. Just have wholesome thoughts. Being happy to be in the Sangha, to share this Dharma with each other. And then when we've applied our mind to the wholesome, then we want to sustain it again, to keep our minds, give our minds something to do. Because if we let our minds just do whatever it wants to do, then Sooner or later it's going to fall back into the old habits. So we've got to keep it going. And at first it's going to take a bit of effort, but it's going to get easier and easier as time goes on. So, and then to end the sutta here, What is the cultivation of concentration or Samadhi? The cultivation is the repetition, the constant or ongoing development, and the cultivation of these wholesome states. That is the development of Samadhi. So this I find really interesting, that in this sutta it's really, really clear what concentration or Samadhi is. You really don't see it explained so clearly anywhere else. And also one other thing that's really interesting that's mentioned here is applied and sustained thoughts. Is mentioned here as a verbal formation. This is really interesting because many teachers will say that applied and sustained thought are to apply and sustain the mind on the objects of meditation, the object of concentration. For example, they will say, ah, you have to focus on the tip of the nose, that's what it means. It means to apply and sustain your thinking on the tip of the nose. But in this sutta, it's made really clear that no, actually it's a verbal formation, so it actually has to do with thoughts and not with just focusing. So that's one other interesting thing about this sutta. Alejandro, does this answer your your question on the concentration.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, definitely a lot of information there. I think, yeah, mainly positive thoughts. This could be probably the biggest tool that we can— our concentration, which is a challenge.

**Speaker A:** And is this how you've been practicing it before, or how have you been practicing it?

**Speaker C:** No, no, mainly Anapanasati, mindfulness on the breathing. So I try to concentrate on the sensation that has been a bit frustrating, and my concentration is not improving.

**Speaker A:** Sorry, you mentioned your Concentration is not improving. I'm having a little trouble hearing you.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, sorry, the microphone might not be working well. Yeah, my concentration has been not very, let's say, well, it's hard to say without creating expectations, but not very stable. My attention is not very stable on the breath, and it's a bit frustrating.

**Speaker A:** Yes, so yeah, one of the good things to go about it is you don't have to be constantly mindful of the breathing. It's good enough to just come back to it often. So even if you are not constantly aware of the breathing, If you, yeah, whenever you remember to come back to the breathing, that's good. And if you can remember to remember to come back to the breathing, then you can congratulate yourself for that as well. So yeah, you can play with that. Deirdre, I see you've got your— oh sorry, go ahead, Alejandro.

**Speaker C:** No, no, that's— thank you. I tried to instill positive mindset. But it's not easy.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's good. Keep going like that. All right, Dharma, go ahead. Uh, your microphone is still muted.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, got it, got it. Yeah, so I think it's really nice that you add like two because I've been also practicing like doing every day, 6 times a day, at least 5 minutes concentrating on the breath. And then I find it that I get really easily distracted about when it's really busy and there's a lot to do. It's really, oh, and I get all kinds of ideas while doing that. But I think what's a good, what you added now is to keep the mind busy with a wholesome task. I think that's a really nice add to add this because you had to taking time to concentrate on the breath and taking really a break from everyday, from what you're doing and really trying to be mindful and really to concentrate on what's happening or in me. That's a wholesome task, but more like you are teaching now the Dhamma is also like a wholesome task, you see. So it's like more like a life task that will keep you in the Dharma, I think. It's really interesting that if you just work in an office and you don't like your job or whatever, and you just do it because you have to make money or whatever, then then it makes it harder to be living the Dharma, I guess. So I like the add that you say, keeping it wholesome and give it a wholesome task. And what's also interesting is about my question about the inner world and the outer world, you said, no, the first thing Dhammarato ever said to me is when we talked about doing this, living in the Dhamma, that he said, nothing to do, nowhere to go, but then spring will come and the grass will grow. So that's not, I have to do anything for it. So there you have the connection between in and out. So I just wanted to make that remark.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's a really good way of looking at it. And Dhammarato actually talks about this quite a lot, as in time structuring. So how do we spend our time? And yeah, I was actually thinking about this today. I was explaining it to Stan, who was visiting, is that, for example, when I am reading a book. I read books from Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. Right now I'm reading Seeing with the Eye of Dhamma, which is a really good book, right? By the way, I really recommend it for everyone. But the reason that I'm reading this book is not necessarily because I want to gain some knowledge from it. Like, it's a good addition, of course, to what I already know. But the main reason why I read it is because I have to structure my time. When I am having wholesome thoughts all the time, then sometimes I get a little bit tired and I want to go do something else. So one really good way for me to spend my time is to read about the Dhamma. Oh, the leaf blower is behind me. Is it really loud or is it okay? Okay, good. Um, yeah, so that's a really good way for me to spend my time, is to read about the Dharma and keep my mind on the Dharma. And this is also a right effort, like we are giving, um, yeah, we're— I'm giving my mind a test. Do that is wholesome. And yeah, especially when you are living like the lay life, you are, and you have a job, then I think it's really important to, yeah, look on the bright side and see in which ways you can make whatever activity you are doing into a wholesome activity. And yeah, one other point that you mentioned about when the spring comes, the grass will grow by itself. This is a, yeah, this is a really true statement because if we just keep removing unwholesome states and keep applying us to wholesome states, then yeah, the wholesome states will come. And in the book that I'm reading, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about what the Buddha said about this. And the Buddha said that the mind is naturally very pure, very bright, and very happy. So we don't really even need to make our minds very happy. If we just give it the inclination, if we just apply it to the wholesome, then it will reveal itself, like its true nature, as something that is really already very, very wholesome. Yeah, and that's pretty much what I have to say about that. Is there anyone who wants to add something about that? Carl, you always have really good things to say.

**Speaker E:** Not today. You covered it quite perfectly. I feel like adding on top of it would be like adding two cherries instead of one, you know.

**Speaker A:** Oh, that's a great compliment, thank you. Let's see, I think Ben, you had a question about the chi energy, right? Or was that someone else?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that was Edward, and he just left about a minute ago.

**Speaker A:** Ah, he just left. Okay, I see. So actually, it's quite interesting to talk about. I'm not too sure about what chi entails, but I'm guessing that it's about like positive bodily feelings. And yeah, I've been playing with this myself as well here on retreat. And what I've really noticed is that I saw tiredness as a hindrance because we often talk about how sloth and torpor, about how this is a hindrance, right? So I was like, I'm trying to remove this tiredness, but I think somehow I probably missed something from the teaching. So I called again with Dhammarato, and I was like, is this really— is tiredness like really a bad thing? And then apparently I had gotten it wrong all along, and that it's not really about tiredness, it's more about the victim's attitude of being tired, like, oh, this costs so much energy, this is, this is so tiring. And that's when I started realizing that, yeah, actually it's, it's okay to be tired, and I can really just lay down and enjoy being tired and enjoy having nothing to do. And that makes it so simple. And so easy to relax. So that's what I've been playing with over the last week, and I can tell that I've really cooled down because I don't feel the need to meditate in any particular posture, and I'm just getting so relaxed. So that's really good. Deirdre, go ahead.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I want to add to that, that nowadays, since I've heard this before, like tiredness is not a hindrance, it's also sometimes I think it's actually a good thing to be tired because then I'm not so uptight. I'm not smashing energy in something. I have to be a little careful with energy, and that makes me also more relaxed to work with or to get things done in a much easier way or make decisions like, okay, let's not make an appointment, I'm tired, let's hit some things. So there's actually also a value in that desire.

**Speaker C:** Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, like, yeah, basically we have like a rhythm, a daily rhythm of our energy levels. Like, and this is very natural, sometimes we naturally get more energy because there's things to be done. For example, when we have work to do, then it's good to have some energy. And in the evening when we are getting ready for bedtime, like our body automatically knows that, oh, we've had a long day. And yeah, the night is coming, so there's no more work to be done. And it's really, really nice to like settle into that natural rhythm. And yeah, that's a really wholesome way to live your life. Dhammarato also told me like when he was in the hospital, he was like, oh, now I don't have to think about a Sangha call, like people are taking care of that. I can just lay here and the doctor is ordering me to do nothing and to just chill out. And you know what, I'm just gonna enjoy it. That's all right. Everything's okay. So yeah, I agree. This is a really good way to just enjoy how much energy our body gives us. And our mind gives us at any given moment. Thank you for that comment. So David, welcome, I see you've joined. It looks like Kartal is going to be heading to Suamokh very soon, so you'll probably be seeing him there. Oh, interesting. Yeah, he told me he wanted to.

**Speaker B:** Go to Dipapawan first.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, he actually went there, but, uh, he said that there's not, not much, um, yeah, it's not a perfect place to stay for him, so he will be going to, uh, to Suamok. Oh, interesting. Probably, uh, in the next week. Leandro, go ahead.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, because you— sorry, it's windy here, so I'm not sure you're going to hear me okay.

**Speaker A:** Now it's good.

**Speaker C:** Okay, so because you touched on tiredness, which is a big thing for me lately, and a good reminder from Dhammarato to not be a victim and complain about it, so that's, that's a good thing. But at the same time, I do get the let's say the urge of fixing it, right? Of, okay, can I change my diet? Can I take something? Can I exercise more? And I think that goes against— so Dhammarato will tell me, oh, stop that, right? Or don't pursue that, just be okay with the way things are. But to me, that's very difficult. That's very, very, very difficult to refrain from trying to, okay, I'm tired, what can I do to feel better, to not feel so tired, and start planning and doing, which implies suffering of course, because you are not getting what you want. But I find it very difficult to not do nothing about it. So how do you think about that?

**Speaker A:** So one way to think about it is, are you wanting to get rid of the tiredness because you have something to do right now, or because you have something to do later. Because sometimes we will think like, oh, in 1 hour I'm going to have to go into the city, I have things to do, so I want to feel— I want to have more energy already. And this is kind of the same thing that Dhammarato talks about when We are laying in bed at night and we're thinking about all the stuff we have to do the next day. And because of that, we're thinking like, oh, I have to go to bed right now because I need to rest so that I have energy later. So that's one thing to look out for. And the other thing Sometimes there is actually some value, I would say, to like changing your attitudes to having more energy. And one example of that would be like your alarm clock goes off, you wake up, and then you have to get out of bed because you have to be downstairs in 10 minutes. And that's a good way to change your attitude, like, oh, I'm tired now, but, uh, okay, let's, let's do this. I can, I can do it happily even though I'm a little bit tired. And this is what I really learned in the monastery. Like, sometimes I have to get up really early, for example, at like, uh, 2 PM, because I have to hit the gong, and I will be like really tired. And if I just change my attitude, then I will have a lot more energy. But yeah, for you, like, in what situations do you get these feelings? Is it like, do you need energy right now, or do you need energy later?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, well, ideally I would like to have energy all the time. But to me, the frustration is more long-term, maybe, right? That if I have this level of energy, this level of time that I have been having for quite some time, it will be very difficult for me to achieve the things that are important to me, right? To learn these difficult subjects, or be the father I would like to be.

**Speaker D:** Or sort of things.

**Speaker C:** So things I deem to be important are very hard to achieve with this level of energy. Excellent.

**Speaker A:** You cut out a little bit at the end, but I got the gist of what you were saying. And a good way to to go about this is to, yeah, to look at what Dhammarato said earlier in this call, and that is if you take care of your mind right now and just focus on the task that you are doing right now and do that in the most wholesome way that you can do it with the best possible attitudes then the future will take care of itself. And when we are having like hot thoughts about wanting to improve our energy levels, then this is going to actually decrease our energy. Because yeah, the body tires because of the unwholesome thoughts that we are having. And I can really notice this, that if I've had like a so to say, like a really bad day, then at the end of the day I will be really, really tired because it takes a lot of energy to be having those kind of thoughts. So when you get into those kind of thinking patterns, it's really useful. Actually, the Buddha, there's a really good point about this in the sutta. And the sutta is about removing unwholesome thoughts. And the Buddha gives a simile here. He says, why run when I can walk? Why walk when I can stand still? Why stand still when I can lay down? So the meaning of this is It's a lot of energy that you are putting into thinking like this. So see that and consider like how much energy you are putting into having these kind of thoughts. And when you see that, when you see how tired it is making you, then you will automatically decrease the restlessness and decrease the thoughts that you are having about this.

**Speaker C:** Absolutely. I do also notice that when I have unwholesome thoughts, my mind is particularly active. It has a huge impact on my physical sensations of tiredness. So yeah, we need to be careful about that.

**Speaker A:** Great. Yeah, go play with that. That's a good idea. Karl, I see you had your hand raised up for a short while.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I just wanted to say that there's a confusion between tiredness and restlessness. So what we're talking about here is the restlessness of the mind. You're looking to fix so many things. As you said, you want to go on a diet, you have to improve something in your life, and that alone, this process of constantly trying to solve the issues in your mind, it's going to get the body very, very tired because it's not being present, it's not being in a wholesome state. So naturally body exerts more energy because you're trying to fix a million things at the speed of like a second. That's how fast the images, the thoughts, that's how fast things come to you and you keep trying to fix them in your mind. Instead of coming down back to the wholesome state and resting the body, the body moves naturally, regains all the all the energy it's needed to move. As an example, what I would call tiredness is when you go on a hike, you climb up the mountain, and at the top you take this big breath and you're like, finally the hike is over, I have made it to the top, I can sit down at the top and I can rest for a bit. That's tiredness. But when we get to the top of the mountain and we say, oh, now I have to climb down, oh, I now have to go get in the car, drive back home, and then have dinner later, that's restlessness. And that's what we precisely talking here about. It's not so much that your body gets tired, it's your mind tires the body.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I think tiredness and restlessness, they have a really strong connection, that they really strengthen each other. Do you see this way too, Carl?

**Speaker E:** Yes, yes, yes. As I see for myself, tiredness doesn't really exist. It's an attitude. It's an attitude of not recognizing when your body needs rest. Like at the end of the day when you're laying in the bed, you're recognizing that your calves are sore, your shoulders are a bit stiff, your back is a bit— So you're just recognizing the bodily sensations, what we call tiredness, right? So it's just bodily sensations. But restlessness is an attitude when we lay there and we're trying to fix the issues of tomorrow and thinking, well, we could have done better today. It's very close, but it's not even the same thing in a way. Tiredness is more like sensations in the body. Meanwhile, tiredness thinking, I cannot do meditation, I cannot do this, is actually the mind. It's not the body so much because you're spending your time up here instead of in the body. And if you were spending time in the body, you could release the sensations. You can enjoy them. You can enjoy being— your calves having— being sore. You can enjoy your shoulders being a bit stiff, and then you can release them. So yeah, it works. It works together.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, really good. I really agree with that. Thank you for that. Ben, go ahead.

**Speaker E:** I was just going to add with like practical things in relation to tiredness. Things like, just as long as you can sort of be satisfied with this moment, but also just consider like, have you drank enough water? Have you eaten?

**Speaker A:** Have you slept?

**Speaker E:** And if you haven't slept and you're physically tired and you have the chance to, just have a nap. You don't need to overthink needing to having something to get rid of, just lie down and have a nap afterwards. You might be brighter. Simple practical things you can do for the physical tiredness if you can.

**Speaker A:** Right, like, yeah, like we discussed before, managing your energy and going along with the rhythm of your energy is a really A really good way to go about that if you want to get stuff done. And yeah, changing our attitudes about the work is also really going to help the amount of energy we have to expend. If we think it's a really difficult task and it's going to be really yeah, it's gonna give us a lot of trouble then. And we look like, oh, I don't really want to do it, like I need a lot of energy for it. Then that automatically increases the efforts that we need to do it. And yeah, Dhammarato of course talks about this a lot, like, uh, yeah, having the attitude of a victim versus having the attitude of a winner. Like, if you have the winner's attitude, like, things become so much easier in life, and that really applies to everything. Carl, go ahead.

**Speaker E:** I was going to just say what we're talking here about, it comes back to the question of the chi. It's essentially the same thing that we're trying to cover. Other than that, the chi is associated with a lot of magical terms. Meanwhile, real practice, real wholesome state is an actual thing. You can actually feel your body releasing the tension. You can feel yourself being more relaxed. And that's what people usually misinterpret for energy inside the body, for chi. It's just complete relaxation of the body. You're becoming more present of your breath, becoming more present of sensations. Mind is becoming more unified. That's what the question of the chi, I feel like, was answered as well here.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's relaxing the body, as you say. Imagine how much energy we expend by being so tight. It's literally costing our body energy. To be like that and causing us all sorts of difficulties. And I agree with you, it's not a magical thing. Thank you for that. And yes, Dhammarato also says the first Jhana is just a state of being really, really, really restful. You just feel at ease all the time. So whatever needs to be done, like, yeah, you can do it. And Bhikkhu Buddhadasa also talks about this in his book, that we have the path and the fruits of Anapanasati. But he says that there's also a more general path and fruit in life, especially for lay people, like for the farmers, for the fishermen. And that is to really focus on doing the task that we need to do in the most wholesome way possible, and that this also has a path and a fruit. And the fruit is that we can do anything that we want to do happily. And Dhammarato talked about this lately, about the art of archery. And this is basically when, back when Japan was a really militarized state and you had a lot of trained archers Around that time, all the wars stopped because the country got unified. And this was around the time that the Zen Buddhism got really popular in Japan. So what they started doing was, instead of trying to hit the targets with archery, they started to focus really on How can I do archery in the most beautiful way possible, in the most wholesome way possible, without trying to hit the target? So they made a whole art out of archery, and when they release the arrow, they don't even look back to see if they hit the target. So the whole drawing they do very, very slowly, very mindfully. And then, well, I don't really know about how archery works, but anyway, they do it in, yeah, in the best way possible. And then you would have like a jury that would look about how you are performing this archery, and they would not judge you on if you hit the target or not, but how much your mind is like immersed into doing the archery. And I think this is a really beautiful way in how we can go about doing anything in life, about how you can go about doing your job. If you're— and this is like an age-old saying, like, don't focus on the destination, but focus on the journey. And that's what we're really getting at here, just like enjoying the journey of the work you are doing. That's where you really get the rewards, and not at getting to where you— yeah, getting to the destination. And yeah, when I look back on like many things that I did in my life, it was often like being in the process of getting there. Like, it's still unwholesome in a way because I wanted to get somewhere, but I did get a lot of benefits out of like just really enjoying the process. Yeah, like for example, going to the gym, like going through the motions, like lifting the weights, eating the food. Like, yeah, maybe that even got me like more satisfaction than seeing myself grow, seeing my body change in the mirror. So I think this applies, yeah, to a lot of different, yeah, things in life. And yes, go ahead.

**Speaker E:** Would we say that everything becomes essentially practice of the Dharma? So we start to see the Dharma in the world, we start to see the Dharma in our actions and in our attitude coming to dealing with the things. So we really, the work doesn't become work anymore, the work becomes the Dhamma, the work becomes the practice and the fruition of your wholesome state. So the work itself stops mattering in a way, and then it becomes kind of like a fun play because now you're making yourself feel wholesome while doing it. So it's becoming a joyful thing. Everything's becoming like a play-like quality.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, like we just try or we stop getting anywhere. We get in the habit of just arriving and being at home.

**Speaker E:** And for people who ask, like, how do you get into like a flow state? That is what we call the flow state, essentially. This is when everything becomes like a play-like motion instead of having this hardness to it. Everything is just going by itself.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, exactly. Just Yeah, that's really the first Jhana, is like being in a state of flow, like reading a good book, watching a good movie, but then in a wholesome way, of course. And it's an interesting point that you brought up, and Bhikkhu Buddhadasa made the following point, and he said, life is the Dhamma and Dhamma is the life. Or developing life is developing Dharma, and developing Dharma is developing life. So that's a really beautiful way, yeah, to put it. Alejandro, go ahead.

**Speaker C:** I'm curious. First of all, thank you for all the details you are sharing, both Ben, Carl, Daniel. It's very, very helpful. But I'm curious to know, Carl, have you said that, and you Daniel also, If you can get into that state of deeply being in the moment and enjoying the small things without having developed that concentration or that strong mind through meditation, it's just a matter of being aware of, okay, it's just about my restlessness is causing this tiredness. It's just being cognitively aware of it enough, or do you have to have this a certain kind of Anagami concentration to be able to enjoy.

**Speaker A:** It? Sorry, I couldn't really hear it that clearly. Is there anyone who could hear it clearly?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, he's asking if without having the right concentration, can you still be in that wholesome state? And I think I'll add it quickly. Before Before needing to be concentration is already putting you out into unwholesome state. So the concentration comes from getting yourself into a wholesome state. It doesn't work the other way. First you need to see that you're getting yourself out in the unwholesome state. Then you drive all the tools, the skill set you have yourself into a wholesome state. And then concentration comes afterwards. You're already in the wholesome state. What you're talking about is not seeing. You're not— I think the word is Sati. You're not seeing, not seeing the unwholesome states, and you're not seeing the thoughts that your mind is providing or images it's providing, and you're getting yourself into restlessness where your mind is running and telling yourself, I'm not a good meditator, I'm not concentrating, and you're trying to fix all these little things instead of bringing yourself back into remembrance this relaxed state and letting the mind take care of itself, letting the mind put you in that flow state as we're talking about here. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I'm sorry, go ahead, Alandra.

**Speaker C:** I see that theoretically, I don't know, I find it very hard to relax when the mind is consumed, which again is an Anapanasati thought.

**Speaker E:** Well, can you take a breath right now and just like—.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, let's all take a breath, a deep breath right now.

**Speaker E:** Can you take another one? And then another one and just keep going. And then another one. And now take another breath and just feel that breath. Just keep taking the breaths. That's what we're focusing here. Just keep taking deep breaths. Do you feel better? You already feel a bit better, right? So that's what we're trying to focus on, the sensation of this pleasure, to drive the mind into that nice and wholesome state. And if you see something come up, you just take another breath and don't worry about it right now. Tell yourself not to worry about it. Just take another breath.

**Speaker A:** One thing I would like to add, what I have been experimenting with myself, is that when I feel mentally tired, and this is usually a result of like a hindrance, like I'm bored, I'm disinterested, anything like that, then a really good way to get yourself up out of that state is to count your blessings, because this really helps to get the, yeah, the positive feelings going. Because when you're in that disinterested state, I find that personally, like, I can think like, oh yeah, everything's all right, and things like that. But that, in that state, it's maybe a little bit less effective than counting my blessings. Because when I count my blessings, then I start to realize like, oh, actually it's not that uninteresting this moment. Actually, this moment is good enough. So what I do is I start thinking like, well, at least I'm not sick right now. Because being sick, that's really, really awful. Or at least I don't have to use public transport right now. 'At least I'm not on a journey right now, a really busy bus ride.' Or 'I'm alive.' Yeah, sometimes that's good enough. Yeah, 'At least I'm not dead.' Like, this is better than being dead. And yeah, for me, this really, really helps to get that positivity going again. So like thoughts like everything's all right already, like that's why we say to play with it. Like it's not really like you have to use this thought in this situation and that thought in that situation. But sometimes, yeah, you find out for yourself that some thoughts help better in some situations than in other. Like everything's all right already, that really helps me when I have like this free-floating anxiety, like just this general feeling that something is wrong, like a sense of impending doom, that if I don't do something, then something's really gonna go wrong. So yeah, you can experiment with that for yourself and see maybe if that helps. And your question that you asked before, what I would like to add is that just because we're not paying attention doesn't necessarily mean we're in an wholesome state. However, it means that if we just let the mind do its thing, it will end up in an wholesome state for a while. I kind of lost my train of thought where I was going with that. Ah, but yeah, if you develop the four kinds of right efforts, yeah, this will get you into a wholesome state for sure. And when you notice that you're not paying attention that's the moment that you wake up. So congratulate yourself for waking up, and you can make a change. But sometimes we find that actually we woke up, but we were having really wholesome thoughts, and then we can go— yeah, so then we can see like, oh, I was having really wholesome thoughts. So Yeah, sometimes we really get into that habit of like, oh, we should be paying attention, but we were not paying attention. But actually, if you can see that you were having wholesome thoughts, then you can just congratulate yourself for it. And then you're like, wow, I wasn't even paying attention. And even though I wasn't paying attention, like, I was apparently already in a habit of being wholesome, at least in that moment. So let me celebrate that, let me be really happy that I found myself in a really happy state, and let me continue that. So yeah, that's how I use it. Is there anything else that someone would like to share today? Anything else to add to this topic? How is the focusing on the tip.

**Speaker E:** Of your tongue, how is that technique going for you?

**Speaker A:** To be honest, I haven't really needed it. In the last week because I've been feeling really, really good. But I've been, yeah, it's been really effective for me. Yeah, like in the past. So have you given it a try since it's stuck in your mind? Maybe you've given it a try. I've just tried it throughout the day, but not during like some big hindrance. I don't feel too many big hindrances these days, so I have to see.

**Speaker E:** If it works or not. But I'm not sure how it would work.

**Speaker A:** But yeah, actually, this is, uh, I'm glad you brought this up because Alejandro, if you are having a lot of unwholesome thoughts about wanting more energy or about needing to get work done, then this is a way that I found that's really, really helpful in calming your minds and also getting energy. And actually, the monastery that I am at right now, there's a teacher here, a Thai teacher, and he's been a monk for like 30 years. And he says that when your mind is like really restless, then try this. And I tried it and it really, really works for me. And basically what you do is, and you only do this when you're like really restless, is you sit down, you just focus on the tip of your tongue. You don't have to place it anywhere in particular, just somewhere where it's comfortable. Some people like to put it at the roof of their mouth. Some people just kind of let it float. And when you are focusing on that, this place of the tongue, this tip of the tongue, is a really coarse, like a really big sensation. So it's really easy to keep your mind there. And if you do it for a few minutes, then you will see that still these unwholesome thoughts are coming up. And what you will do is you just, whenever an unwholesome thought comes up, you just think, I don't have to think about that right now. Let me just pay a little bit of attention to the tip of my tongue. And a little bit, this is an important point, because if we try to focus like really hard, then we are tiring our minds and we are getting ourselves into a state of fight or flight. Like your body associates this really intense focus, I can associate that with the fight or flight, and this can cause some adrenaline to come up. So you just focus really lightly on the tip of your tongue, and whenever hindrance comes up, you just don't have to think about that right now. And then within a few minutes you can feel the Piti and the Sukkha coming up. So when I've gotten myself into like a really, really restless state, then yeah, this helped me get out of it in just a few minutes. And I just do it like just enough to get out of it, and then I start practicing like I do normally. So the Buddha recommends, for example, for really strong, like, unwholesome states, to clench your jaws and like, yeah, bite down and press your tongue into the roof of your mouth and like tense up your muscles. So this is also something you can experience with. Like, for me, that I don't really like doing that, so this is what I do instead. So you can, yeah, you can experiment with these, with this technique. And I will share this sutta because there's actually a few other things we discussed today that are also mentioned in the sutta. For example, the simile of like why run 'When you can walk, why walk when you can stand?' So in this sutta there are 5 ways mentioned to get rid of these unwholesome thoughts, and 2 of them we have not discussed here, so it's really good to read through this sutta. So I will share this after the call. So if— is there anyone else who would like to add some final things, some last things before we end the call? Okay, so nobody has anything to add, so then I think this is a good time to end the call. So thank you very much, everybody. I really enjoyed this, and really good seeing you all here today. Thank you all so much.

**Speaker C:** Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** All right, take care everybody. Bye-bye.

**Speaker E:** Cheers.


### Summary

Here is a summary of the key points from this Dhamma talk:

**Main Themes:** The importance of Sangha (community), sharing the Dhamma, and correct understanding of concentration (samadhi) and wholesome practice.

### **Key Points:**

1.  **Dhammarato's Message (Speaker B):**
    *   He is recovering and will be slow to return, but sees this as an opportunity for the Sangha to grow stronger.
    *   **Core Teaching:** The Dhamma needs the Sangha. He encourages experienced students to guide newcomers through one-on-one calls and the website forum, emphasizing that **teaching others is the best way to clarify and deepen your own understanding**.
    *   **On Concentration:** It is not about focusing on external objects (like a candle or crystal). True concentration is on **cultivating wholesome thoughts** and changing the mind's habits.
    *   **Inner vs. Outer World:** Don't be controlled by external surroundings. The practice is about **mastering your response to the outside world**. If you take care of your mind moment-to-moment, the outer world takes care of itself.

2.  **Daniel's Explanation of Concentration (Speaker A):**
    *   Shares a sutta (MN 44) where the bhikkhuni Dhammadinnā defines *samadhi* as the **"unification of mind."**
    *   This unification is the gathering of factors for the first jhāna: applying & sustaining the mind on the wholesome, accompanied by joy and a feeling of success.
    *   **"One-pointedness" (ekaggatā)** is better understood as **"One Go"**—going directly to the wholesome without delay.
    *   The basis for this concentration is the **Four Foundations of Mindfulness** (body, feelings, mind, mental qualities).
    *   It is developed through the **Four Right Efforts**:
        1.  Abandoning unwholesome states that have arisen.
        2.  Preventing unwholesome states from arising.
        3.  Giving rise to wholesome states.
        4.  Sustaining and perfecting wholesome states that have arisen.
    *   **Crucial Note:** Applied & sustained thought (*vitakka & vicāra*) are **verbal formations** (thoughts), not just silent focus on a physical object like the breath.

3.  **Practical Discussion & Q&A:**
    *   **On Frustration with Breath Meditation:** The group advises not to strive for constant focus. It's enough to **gently return to the breath often** and congratulate yourself for remembering. The primary task is to give the mind a **wholesome task** (like cultivating positive thoughts) to prevent it from wandering into unwholesome patterns.
    *   **On Tiredness & Restlessness:**
        *   A key distinction is made: **Tiredness** is a natural bodily sensation, while **restlessness** is the mental attitude of anxiety, planning, and trying to "fix" things.
        *   **Restlessness tires the body.** The solution is to change your attitude—be okay with the present moment, enjoy the rest, and see tiredness as a signal to relax, not a problem to solve.
        *   The mind is naturally bright and happy; by removing unwholesome thoughts, this natural state reveals itself.
    *   **On "Chi" or Energy:** This is reframed not as a mystical force but as the result of **deep relaxation and release of bodily tension** that comes from a unified, wholesome mind.
    *   **Integrating Dhamma into Daily Life:**
        *   The goal is to make everything part of the practice. By doing any task with a wholesome, mindful attitude, **work becomes Dhamma**.
        *   This leads to a **"flow state"** or a play-like quality in action, similar to the first jhāna.
        *   The example of Zen archery is given: the focus is on performing the action beautifully and mindfully, not on hitting the target (the outcome).
    *   **A Practical Technique for Restlessness:** When the mind is very agitated, gently focus on the **sensation at the tip of the tongue**. This provides a coarse, easy-to-hold object. When unwholesome thoughts arise, lightly note, "I don't have to think about that now," and return to the sensation. This can quickly calm the mind.

**Overall Conclusion:** The talk emphasizes a community-supported, wisdom-oriented path. True practice is about **cultivating wholesome mental states moment-to-moment**, sharing that understanding with others, and integrating this mindful, joyful attitude into all aspects of life, rather than striving for rigid concentration on a single object.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used in the talk:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **Mind in a Fog / Cloud:** Speaker B (Dhammarato) describes his recovering mind as "still foggy, in a cloud," illustrating mental haziness and lack of clarity.
2.  **Infection:** Dhammarato equates being negatively "affected by what surrounds you" to being **"infected"** by it. This frames external influences as a contagious disease that can harm mental well-being.
3.  **Spring and Grass:** Referenced by Speaker D, this metaphor (attributed to Dhammarato) means: if you tend to the causes (spring comes), the results (grass grows) happen naturally. It illustrates how cultivating wholesome inner states naturally leads to positive outer outcomes without force.
4.  **Adding Cherries:** Speaker E (Carl) says adding to Daniel's explanation would be like "adding two cherries instead of one," a metaphor for unnecessary embellishment on something already complete and good.
5.  **Flow State / Play-like Quality:** Used by Carl and Daniel, this describes the experience of work or practice becoming effortless, joyful, and absorbed, like being in a state of "flow" or engaging in "play."
6.  **Victim vs. Winner Attitude:** Daniel contrasts these two attitudes toward tasks. The "victim" attitude sees work as a burdensome struggle, draining energy. The "winner" attitude approaches tasks with a sense of capability, making them easier and less draining.
7.  **Arriving and Being at Home:** Daniel uses this as a metaphor for the practice habit of settling into the present moment with a sense of ease and belonging, rather than striving to get somewhere else.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **Sharing Dharma Clarifies for Self:** Speaker A (Daniel) shares a personal story of how preparing and explaining the Dharma to someone else on a retreat **helped clarify his own practice** and what he needed to do.
2.  **Hospital Recovery as an Opportunity:** Dhammarato tells a brief anecdote about his time in the hospital: instead of worrying, he saw it as a chance to be ordered to do nothing and **"just chill out,"** modeling acceptance and finding the wholesome in a situation.
3.  **The Art of Archery (Zen Story):** Daniel recounts a story about Japanese archers after the wars ended. They transformed archery from a martial skill focused on hitting a target into a **meditative art (Kyudo)**. The focus shifted to the beauty, mindfulness, and mental state of the performer, not the external result. This illustrates the principle of focusing on the wholesome "journey" rather than the "destination."
4.  **Monastic Alarm Clock:** Daniel shares a personal experience from the monastery: having to wake up at 2 AM to hit the gong while very tired. He found that simply **changing his attitude** from resistance to willingness gave him more energy to do the task happily.
5.  **Thai Monk's Advice for Restlessness:** Daniel shares a practical technique passed on by a senior monk: when the mind is very restless, **gently focus on the coarse sensation at the tip of the tongue**. This acts as an easy anchor, allowing unwholesome thoughts to subside. He contrasts this with the Buddha's more forceful advice in the suttas (clenching teeth) and presents it as a modern, gentle adaptation.

### **Key Simile from the Suttas (Referenced)**
*   **"Why run when you can walk?..."**: Daniel references a Buddhist sutta (likely the **Vitakka Santhana Sutta, MN 20**) where the Buddha gives a step-down simile for abandoning unwholesome thoughts. The progressive nature (run → walk → stand → sit → lie down) illustrates **conserving energy and reducing effort** in dealing with restless thoughts.

**In summary**, the talk uses metaphors of nature (fog, spring), health (infection), and attitude (victim/winner) to explain mental states. The stories are primarily personal experiences and a historical Zen tale, all serving to ground the Dharma teachings in practical, relatable examples of putting principles into action.
