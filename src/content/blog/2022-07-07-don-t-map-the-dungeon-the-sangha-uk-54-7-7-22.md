### Transcript


**Speaker A:** It seems like I watched a little bit of the beginning of a previous Sangha talk, and it was— this is a similar thing with Scott talking about procrastination and how there are two types. Like, we can either— well, I think it's helpful to look at it from this perspective, that there's the verbal Sankhara, the rights, rules, and rituals that we have and we learn from society. And then there's the wise doing of things that we would like to do and we think would be wise to do. So there are those two sort of things. The wise doesn't have to always be something we'd like to do, but rites, rules, and rituals. You should do this thing. And there is also things that we know are wise and we do them for the sake that they're wise, not to get some far-out outcome that we are told we should get. And then there's our relationship to both of those, right? That's the relationship to the Sila. You should do this one thing. This would be also the third fetter of Silabhatta Paramasa, clinging to rights, rules, and rituals. Not understanding why we follow the rites, rules, and rituals, that rules or Sila or precepts do have their benefit, but they're often misunderstood in the ordinary mind to having some other benefit of some better rebirth, some whatever it may be, that making merit has some benefit in the future where the benefit is not immediate here and now. That, for example, mindfulness of eating practices, that there will be some enlightenment or magical thing that will happen, or that you're a good boy for practicing mindfulness of eating, where the real benefits of mindfulness of eating are found here and now when we see, say, craving arise, or Tanha, or wanting arise for food. And we can relax into that and glide the mind into that. So Sila and rites, rules, and rituals, they can have their benefit when they're just seen as such. And these two categories of wise things and Sila, they don't really— they're not really mutually exclusive, that there's the rules that we cling to, the things that we cling to, they're the things that are wise to do on the other side. And then in between that, there are things that other people think we should do. And maybe we do them because we think it's worthwhile or easier to do what they want us to do, out of compassion for them, not to upset them. And so it's— there's these ways of that we have duties in the world. And originally, when before coming to the Dharma, the ordinary person relates to these duties in a way of clinging, a way of wanting, a way of I, me, and mine. And now we can begin to relate to these duties in a more skillful way once we can see beyond the aversion to doing things or the liking or disliking. We can realize the impacts that our actions or the way we spend our time has in the world. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah, a lot to unpack there, but Something that just sprung to mind about duty is that, well, really, now that you're on the path, everyone here is on the path, everyone here has discovered the Dharma, discovered the teachings of the Buddha. Your only duty is to the Dharma, and there is no other duty. So, and what does that mean? It's not some sort of like moral, ethical, like set of rules that you need to adhere to. No, it just means your only duty is to the liberation from suffering, or essentially happiness. So the number one goal, you should dedicate as much time as you possibly can in your life to simply just being happy. And, oh, there's nothing to do and nowhere to go. And just because, how long are you really here for? You're not here, you're not going to be alive for very long. So the number one duty of being alive is to enjoy it. That's the number one duty. And that's, to me, synonymous with the Dhamma. So the Dhamma is the breath of life, the enjoyment of being alive, like The experience of really being awake, like that's why they call it awakening, because it really is like you have woken up. There is a brightness, there's a clarity to like seeing the real immediacy and and potency of your sensory experience. And just like the mystery of it all, as it unfolds moment by moment. So any society, any societal duty that you had, is kind of just like a conditioning to be let go of. Really, the only duty there is, is to the Dharma itself, which is life, enjoying it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, and they're to be let go of mentally, let go of in the terms of clinging to the duty as I, me, or mine. That I am a dishwasher for a living, I am whatever the job may be for a living, understanding it in a more wholesome sense of maybe the broader picture, or understanding that it is wise to acquire food, shelter, adequate housing, and medical care. And there are actions that we take to do that, but not clinging to those actions as I, me, or mine, that they're just those actions, just the intentions.

**Speaker B:** And to understand that the— those actions, um, or another way to call them is rites and rituals, is that they're not going to lead to Nibbana. So they aren't the path to Nibbana. So nothing we do as a rite or ritual, or like, um, sort of, sort of like a formality of things, like nothing we do on that basis of just repetition is going to lead to Nibbana. But, uh, Actually, just the repetitive waking up out of that process is what leads to Nibbana. So not to confuse the repetitive nature of practice, practicing the Dhamma, with the repetitive nature of, you know, societal organization and societal functions. So frameworks that our life is given to sort of like the same way, like at a cattle ranch, they'll have the little paths for the cattle to walk through. They're fenced in and they have to walk through. Those are like the societal rites and rituals. So what you're actually doing is breaking free from those and then go frolic in the meadow. So you're going to frolic and be a happy little cow in the meadow. You're no longer bound by the rites and rituals and the fences and the enclosures of these psychological prisons that you either had unknowingly or knowingly that you have inherited from the culture. And your parents. So it's kind of is like a breaking out of prison type of thing. So it should feel very free and very like open, like, like, uh, not to say we don't have our responsibilities and obviously our relative duties to, you know, to seek the end of suffering, right? So Living under a bridge and living in destitution and not seeking to improve that situation won't help our goal for Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. So it's on a completely practical level of why do we do the things that we do in life? It's only for the sake of Dukkha, Nirodha.

**Speaker A:** I know what you're trying to say, but some people like living under a.

**Speaker B:** Bridge, so— Oh yes, yes, yes. If you can live under a bridge and, you know, stay relatively away from the exposure of the elements and disease, and more power to you. So, you know, there's no, again, like, no formula of the way to do this. But I'm saying the reason why we might do things is for the sake of Dukkha, Nirodha. It's not for the identification of it. It's not for the, oh, this is my job, I'm a big shot, I'm important. Like, no, it's just for the sake of this is the most practical way to end suffering and for myself and others. And I guess like we can talk about it in that kind of way of ending suffering, but that's even kind of like, that's a little like downer. Like, that's a little like, you want to think about it on the side of, no, actually, just we get to enjoy this life. We get to enjoy it. Like, like, that's a gift, like, in and of itself. It's not that we have to fight a big bad boogeyman called suffering, which is a mistranslation. Really what it means is dis-ease, dissatisfaction. So that's a much more handle— like, that brings it down to the real scale of it. Whereas what we're really just solving here is a simple little dissatisfaction. That's it. We're just a little bit dissatisfied. We can't sit down and just take a deep breath and just relax. That's the only thing we're solving with the Dharma. We're not tackling these big scary boogeymen called suffering and stuff like that, or dark nights of the soul or whatever. Yeah, so that's the end of my spiel. If anyone wants to jump in or has anything. Thank you for that. Thank you. I really enjoyed listening. Thank you. Thanks for listening.

**Speaker A:** I've been dealing with some Anapanasati. I can't hear you.

**Speaker B:** The connection. Can you hear me now? Yeah, that's fine.

**Speaker C:** All right.

**Speaker B:** So recently I've been struggling with some like social anxiety and that sort of thing. And like today I've really like realized.

**Speaker A:** That.

**Speaker B:** It really is just in my mind. Like situation can be the same because like I was on a train for 6 hours and this guy didn't message me back. And then not 6 hours, like 3 hours. I was like, just like on train. Okay. Okay, you're on a train. I think you broke up. Thank you.

**Speaker D:** It sounds like a math problem. Like the beginning of a problem. You're on train number 3 going 30.

**Speaker E:** Kilometers an hour, 20 degrees to the northeast.

**Speaker A:** When— And then like he did message.

**Speaker B:** Me at the end of it and he was like, sorry, sorry, sorry. And I was like kind of fuming a little bit before he— Oh, is it my connection? Is it really shit? Yeah, we can't get it since— Someone else speak. Someone else speak.

**Speaker C:** I can hear you guys.

**Speaker A:** It sounds like that you were on the train for 6 hours and you.

**Speaker B:** Were heading northeast at about 330 km/h.

**Speaker D:** It's a bullet train, 260 km/h.

**Speaker B:** To be honest, it's like a— It's like a stupid stereotypical Dharma story of like, you know, I was upset and then they said sorry and I felt better. And the situation's the same.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's good that you shared. I think that the people listening to this will benefit from hearing, even though that these stories are the same, we're all humans. So if anyone has stories like this, stuff they're going through, I think it's helpful for the people watching and you to express it and get answers.

**Speaker B:** No, I usually love Robert's, like, what Robert says because it generates such good Dhamma talks. So it's always a joy to hear Robert share, but it's just the only problem— I'm a fuse. The only problem was this time is the connection, so we couldn't really hear clearly what you're trying to say. So I'm on mobile data underground, like a shopping center.

**Speaker A:** Is this the general consensus, or is this the general idea of the story, that you were on the train, you texted someone, you expected a text back, and you didn't hear the text back, and then you got yourself worked up and angry at the person in your head, and then once you got— eventually you got a text back and you were relieved? But it's like the reality of the situation before, Parker, is that you were on the train and and just you were— it was just you on a train with your phone. But the mind will create these mental states and get you worked up into a situation of fear of what do they think of me, that there are these concepts that we're clinging to of our social status and what people think of us and how people respect that social status. And we don't need to get in the nitty-gritty of it. All we need to see is that If there can be Sati and the right view and right effort implemented there, we don't have to go down that thought spiral. That whenever we wake up to it on that train, at whatever moment that thought comes, we can let go and relax however far we are down the spiral. Oh, I don't need to think about that right now. I'm complete right now. And I don't need this. I don't need this other person's permission to be happy.

**Speaker D:** And the conclusion of the story is he had an underground burger at Burger King.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, with a Guinness too.

**Speaker B:** I got two Guinnesses. I got one for each of us, but I guess now I have to drink both.

**Speaker D:** That's a win-win. That's a win-win.

**Speaker B:** Are you at like an airport right now, Robert? No, I'm just in like a shopping center outside the train station.

**Speaker D:** He's in a sewer and he's stacking burgers.

**Speaker C:** Those sewers look like in the UK.

**Speaker B:** We got the mush sewers.

**Speaker D:** Stacking burgers at the— Yeah, it's calm.

**Speaker B:** I'm chilling. Okay, that's— you hit the nail on the head. That's literally all I was going to say, and you explained it better for me anyway. So that was it. That was it.

**Speaker A:** Well, you seem satisfied now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker C:** I feel good on that.

**Speaker B:** It helped me deal with like my fear of like social rejection and stuff. I thought I was being like— that.

**Speaker A:** Fear will come back again. Likely, but you'll want to continue to practice and continue to have this repetition and reflect on times like now where you are satisfied and you are in a wholesome state, that a simple thought like that or simple change in the world can set off these conditions in the mind or habit of getting ourselves into an unwholesome state. So being able to be ready for that and get yourself in a wholesome state when those thoughts arise and see them just as thoughts, as not me, that that person, that Instagram account is not me, that's just an Instagram account where messages are shared that arise in my head, that that response from them is not dangerous. There's no me that it's threatening that response. It's It's just a communication of information. It's what we do with the information that's communicated in the text. If we read that information, we process it as this information applies to something I cling to, this idea of myself that I cling to. And it is then when we feel threatened, then when we feel fear or stress or dissatisfaction arise. But if we can have Sati then, have wisdom then. We can just see the text. We can just see the response and leave it just as that. That, okay, they, that they won't be able to make this meeting at some time, or there was not a response to the text yet. Okay, there's no me there. There's no clinging to anything there. And we can just leave it at that.

**Speaker B:** Well said. Life is beautiful. It really is. It really is all about mindset. It's all about how you view it, you know. Yes. And I'm realizing this more and more that, you know, the percentage of like how much of it is how I view it versus how much of it is innate situation is changing. And it really feels like it's becoming more just how I view it. It's almost 100% how you view it. It's like 90% how you view it. It's 10% of what actually happened. And even, I don't know if we want to go to the— that's even more on a mundane— even on the mundane level of things, it's 90-10%. But on the super mundane level of things, it's 100% how you view it, because everything is dependently originated. So you can actually see in real time the arising of the feeling mechanism and the sense of self with the objects it perceives. And I know I'm trying to use a lot of highfalutin words here as Dhammarato would say, but really, um, the actual— what I'm saying is like there's a skill to be developed that you can see the mechanism, the feeling mechanism, and you can deconstruct it and you can engineer it to feel the way that you want to feel. So it's like an intentional thing. But it's a skill that you can develop. So like, yeah, we are changing the way we view things because that's engineering the mechanism for how we feel about things. So, and that's like, that's the most important thing, like Like, you don't remember what someone said to you. You don't remember what exactly you did. You just remember how they made you feel.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So in any situation, the feelings, that's where the meat of the sandwich is. Okay. Like, this is where the beef is.

**Speaker A:** Like, it's like— delusion, that thinking that— just laughed. The world changing in some way changes the way we feel. That that person texted me, so I feel bad without filling in the steps of the process that that person texted me, I didn't like it because I was clinging to some idea of me or mine or whatever, and then I felt bad. And that process in the middle, the wanting and liking and clinging, that can all be seen and changed if we have the Sati and we take the right effort when we see that those thoughts or those processes arise. This is also sort of related to— there was a talk with Robert recorded maybe yesterday, maybe a few days ago, about the 8 worldly conditions, the 8 worldly winds that are talked about in the suttas: gain and loss, fame and disgrace, praise and blame, and pleasure and pain. And these are all things that are changing around us. These conditions are impermanent. It's how we relate to these conditions that will decide if we suffer or not, if there's dissatisfaction or not, if there's Dukkha or not. That's— go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there— that these 8 worldly winds are all impersonal forces. So if you're gonna take it, if you see them as like someone to blame for them, either yourself or others, then there will be Dukkha. But that's not the way it is. These 8 worldly winds have always been how the world works since time.

**Speaker A:** Immemorial.

**Speaker B:** The dawn of civilization, it has been— what is it— ill repute and— okay, I'm not going to list all of them. Like, Parker knows all of them, but.

**Speaker A:** I have a list here.

**Speaker D:** He's literally ready for any direction the conversation is going to go.

**Speaker E:** Turn it to a poster, put on your wall.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so, you know, people are put in the headlines of the news article, and then, oh, there were a couple weeks before, there were some sort of hero to the public, and then now they're Now they're the bottom of the barrel. So these are the 8 worldly winds, and they just blow around like impersonal, just like the weather. They're winds, right? So you're not going to get mad at a hurricane for being a hurricane. A hurricane just happens, just a byproduct of forces that are operating on a much grander scale than anyone is responsible for, or can even— can even— like, you can't pin a self down to it. There's no— there's no— this whole mixture of things happening, there's no self that like links happenings together as like, that's that person is to blame for that, or even something you did in the past. Like, that is completely gone. And like, every moment is just its own birth, like the universe perpetually giving birth to a Numa. And there's no continuous entity, so it's completely free. That's why Samsara is Nirvana. Like, once you realize this, like the simple truth of it, like the simple Dharma, then you're out of the cycle of birth and death.

**Speaker A:** So the eye of the hurricane. Yeah, so all the Dukkha is going around, around you, but there's no need to jump into the hurricane and cling to any of it. It's like, just get blown away.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker D:** I get a lot of that with my— a lot of my students want to talk about the news and how they're stressed out by these events, these world events, these events in their city or in their country, you know, and I let them speak for a little while, just listen, and I'm like, well, just worrying about it help the problem out? Does it assist it in any way? They're like, no. And I said, do you think not worrying about it is going to make it worse? Well, no. Okay, think about that. Think about that for a moment. It's like, oh, I guess I hadn't considered that before.

**Speaker B:** So yeah, it's most of our griping and comes out of delusion that is not beneficial for anyone.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, like a lot of people feel like they have a responsibility to worry or to be informed, and attached to being informed is this idea of worrying with that. Like, oh, if I'm not informed and if I'm not concerned or angry or upset or dissatisfied somehow, then I'm not paying attention, or I'm somehow failing my duty as this citizen of— Yeah, it's completely— Exactly, exactly. It really is, right? But they've, you know, that's part of their illusion, part of their identity that they're buying into, you know. And rather than say it in an aggressive way, I'm trying to skillfully lead them to the conclusion of that their worry actually only hurts themselves. It doesn't actually assist or alleviate whatever the problem is they're concerned about, right? You know, at all.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, yeah, this is sort of, uh, the same— on the same, uh, wavelength of the poem that, uh, was shared, uh, I shared earlier in the Discord and Skype by Buddhadasa, that the title is Insane for Them to Cheer. There's a lot of wanting to look good But it's much more difficult to do. So they get carried away as if crazy. Aren't we silly? We people creating ourselves, thinking it's right, it's good, following the advice of ghosts. So they lose the path of morality, sunk in the mud beneath the lotus's roots, blossoming all over, not at all fragrant. Not at all fragrant. This makes them push ahead as if crazy, getting upset, revealing their lunacy even more, showing off their very craziness. Boy, it's very hard to do good. Or boy, it's hard to really do good. That this stressful attitude of wishing things would be different, clinging to things, wanting them to be different in our minds, of seeing some news events, not liking it. Getting stressed about it, talking to the friends about it. Isn't this horrible? That has no real impact, no real doing good.

**Speaker B:** And it's like, if you look at your life and you see on the moment-to-moment basis, like, what has changed in my real life? Nothing has changed. And on that level of things, and then so all of this is like a big, like, that, that That's such a good poem, Parker. My interpretation of that is, it's like poking fun at like the lunacy of this show that humans engage in, of like putting our own virtues on a pedestal as like a showmanship thing. So it's like you're not actually living it, you're just thinking, oh, these other people need to think I'm a good person, so I'm gonna say this, or I'm gonna act upset about this. It's all like, it's all a show. It's a game show.

**Speaker D:** It's like a virtuous— it's like a virtuous peacock.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's like you're just— it's like.

**Speaker D:** A big dazzling illusion just to get praised.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you're trying to come— really what you're trying to do is put yourself above others. With extravagant means of like trying societal manipulation, or like trying to fool others into thinking that you're a good person, instead of actually just being a good person and like being an earnest person and living off the fruit of that and the happiness that comes from simply doing good by yourself and doing good by others. Like, that's what— that's the only— that's the only purpose. And like, that's the only good that's gonna come of good intention. Like, it's not for— it's not for like the reward that— or it's not for so you're gonna make— so a bunch of people are gonna think you're a good person. No, that doesn't matter. What matters is the actual direct experience of are you acting from a place of goodwill? And are you— is there good intentions in your heart? And that's where it matters.

**Speaker D:** And all that virtue cueing you're talking about, all that morality cueing that you're discussing actually inflates the sense of self-importance at the same time too. So it actually bolsters the ego and makes it even, even more unmanageable, you know.

**Speaker B:** Right, it's— yeah, it just became disaster.

**Speaker D:** Exactly.

**Speaker B:** And, uh, people become crazy.

**Speaker A:** I'm still suffering from PTSD from listening.

**Speaker B:** To the latest Jordan Peterson, uh, video. Oh yeah, like Jordan Peterson is a good example. Like, the, the, the thing is, it doesn't matter what side of the political spectrum you are, you can see the same truths in every single side of it. So you can see the lunacy that goes on in both sides, like, like, like, um, this rabbit holes, like mental rabbit holes that, um, you can go on. Like Jordan Peterson, um, thinking it's like some sort of like wise philosophy, but like really, you look at him and he's miserable and he's not a happy person. So that's the fruit. So if you want to see, like, does this guy really know what he's talking about, like talking about life? Well, let's see, like, what is he like? Like, does he actually enjoy himself, or is he preaching some sort of like sad, like very nihilistic type of like, I don't know, most of Western philosophy is like pretty downer. It's like, like if you read like Schopenhauer and stuff, like you're gonna want to like, all this stuff is like garbage, and it's not, it doesn't lead to anything good.

**Speaker A:** It's a lot of Sati, a lot of seeing, a lot of conceptualizing.

**Speaker B:** There's Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** There's a lot of suffering. The world really sucks. We can really— without any changing of that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, we can go as intricate as we want to about how much Dukkha there is, and we can talk about— we could write essays and essays about the Dukkha.

**Speaker D:** No, they've already been written. They've already been written, Scott.

**Speaker B:** They've already been written, but that's not interesting. That's not what people— that's not really what matters. What matters is the way out of Dukkha, or the end of Dukkha. And that's the only interesting philosophy, if you want to put it that way, there is. And that's a lot shorter. That's a lot shorter and more simpler way out. Suffering is really complicated, and it gets really in-depth and like The way out tends to be a little bit more concise, a little bit more precise. And that's why the Dhamma is such a beautiful instrument that is— go for it.

**Speaker D:** I've got it. I've got a way to concisely say all that. Let's not map out the dungeon. Let's just go for the exit.

**Speaker B:** Yes, like that.

**Speaker D:** Don't map out the dungeon, just go for the exit. That's it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, perfect. Beautiful.

**Speaker D:** And don't write about your experiences in the dungeon, just go for the exit.

**Speaker B:** Just go to the exit.

**Speaker A:** But the dungeon scholar would go to each room of the dungeon. Okay, this room's that. They'll come to the end. But they won't exit at the end. They'll go back because they missed something.

**Speaker D:** Because there's more, there's more to explain, there's more treasure.

**Speaker B:** They're gonna get Easter eggs.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, it's a completionist dungeon trip. Let's just go for the exit, man. Just go for the exit. It's dark down there. It's cockroaches. So I've been managing a bit of a mild cold for the last 3 days. It's been a tad difficult to sit in formal practice, but it's been a really great experience because having these symptoms, whatever they may be, are really making me aware of the physical form. And it's actually been something, as odd as it sounds, kind of pleasurable to have this experience of feeling tired and, you know, having difficulty speaking. Or especially when I'm speaking as a teacher, I have got to do a lot of talking. And trying to stay focused. But rather than trying to feel annoyed by this, you know, the situation, I've been viewing it as just an opportunity, like another opportunity to appreciate things the way they are, you know, in the moment. And yeah, it's great. I mean, I'm not You know, I'm not experiencing severe symptoms, so it's relatively easy to do it this time, you know. But it's, yeah, it's actually been, I would say, an interesting and pleasurable experience. And after the initial bout of, oh, I can't do exactly as I want to do, I can't exercise the way I want to, I can't sit in formal practice the way I want to, after that like little momentary bout of like, uh, After that, it was just a very time to accept that situation. It's like, okay, let's just take the steps that I need to respect and adjust to what I've got, the situation that's going on. And every time I have to cough or clear my throat, that's an opportunity to wake up, wake up. So it's sort of like finding finding those moments of awareness that the cold is providing to me, rather than trying to resist it and say, the cold is distracting me from XYZ. I'm like, no, the cold is actually showing me what's going on. And that's a good thing. That's a helpful thing. So I want to share that experience with everybody.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that sounds really skillful. But even.

**Speaker D:** Mild illness can be used to stay in the moment, right? To appreciate it, you know? And that feeling of hot soup when you're sick is really great. It's really great. And just to get lost in that, right? Like certain sensations are more uncomfortable, but some sensations are actually more pleasurable as they alleviate that symptom. So, you know, I just figured, oh, it's a good opportunity to tell all my Dharma friends that, you know, it ain't that bad. It's actually, it's actually a great opportunity. You know, when my students ask me, oh, how are you today? I'm not someone who says, oh, I'm fine. I tell them how I am. I'm like, oh, I'm sick. You know, oh, you're sick? Yeah.

**Speaker B:** What's wrong?

**Speaker D:** Oh, I have this and this and this. Oh, I'm so sorry. But I try and push them away from feeling sympathy for me. Yeah, I say no, Don't feel bad. I'm fine. I'm good. Yeah, I'm able to do my job. And I'm able to talk to you. I'm not in the bed. I'm not in the hospital. You know, this is not too bad. You know, I may not speak as quickly or have as many things to say because my mind is a little bit slower. But let's continue, you know, and just keep it going. You know, so anyway, that's my experience I wanted to share with everybody.

**Speaker B:** I like the honesty.

**Speaker A:** Thank you for sharing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like you were saying though, just being like, hey, I am sick, but I'm fine with it. Not just I'm fine, but hey, you know, I am sick. I'm having these physical things happen, but I'm adjusting to it.

**Speaker A:** You would say though, Rick, it sure.

**Speaker B:** Beats the alternative of like taking that approach as opposed to just being like.

**Speaker D:** Oh, you know, really going into this awful— Yeah, like, oh, I've got 5 more hours of conversations with people. How am I gonna make it like that? No, it's just like, no, I've got 5 or 20 conversations in the next 5 hours. And even, even not feeling well, let's see if I can still somehow take the person from a state of discomfort or anxiety and bring them to a calmer, more pleasure, like more happy or happier state. With this 10 or 20 minute conversation, regardless of how I'm physically feeling, because mentally I'm still feeling wonderful, I'm still feeling pleasant, I'm still feeling satisfied. And so that doesn't matter, the physical conditions don't affect the internal what all is going on, and it's not enough to— so, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so that's a good example of It's not necessarily the circumstances or what the information or what is actually happening, but how you interpret it. So if we're feeling a little sick, a little under the weather, and we view that through— are you going, Robert?

**Speaker A:** You're on mute.

**Speaker B:** I hear you.

**Speaker D:** What's up, Robert?

**Speaker B:** My phone's on 4%, so I'm going to have to need it for Spotify on the way back. But it's been a great chat. I've enjoyed it. Yeah, yeah. You guys made my evening.

**Speaker A:** Good seeing you, Robert.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'll see you next time, Robert. Bye-bye. Bye, Robert. So what I was getting to say is, so yeah, if you view you're a little bit under the weather and you view things like, oh, like I have, oh, how many more hours of this do I have to do? And then just get through it and it's going to be like a fight all the way through it. And it's going to— you're going to suffer all the way to the very end. But if you view it, you view and interpret it differently, like you can see it as an opportunity to remember, an opportunity to practice the Dharma.

**Speaker D:** Exactly. That's what I look at it as. It's all just an opportunity, you know. And the students, you know, they want to give me all kinds of sympathy. I'm like, no, look, I've got my coffee. I've got my water. I'm not, I'm not in this. I'm not on my deathbed, you know. It's fine. Now let's do this.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's objects, uh, that we don't like, or situations that we don't like. We can even thank teachers, like, this is a great opportunity to practice being sick. I'm grateful for this. This is a gift.

**Speaker D:** That's Precisely.

**Speaker A:** Similar experiences with people we don't like or we compete with, that I'm very glad I met this person because they showed me a side of me that was competitive or didn't like people or there was some aversion there. That can be a great gift for us in practice to expose these unwholesome tendencies.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, these habits. Absolutely.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Because hey, we're gonna get sick, we're gonna die. So if we can have practice with being sick before we get sick and die, that's a great opportunity. Realizing, yeah, the body is just a body. No one ever promised you that you'd be able to breathe through your nose. That the nose gets stuffy. And there is breathing through the mouth, and there is congestion, and these are all imperfect.

**Speaker B:** Uh, full of seawater in Thailand and just snort it up through one nostril. That's what, uh, that's the Dhammarato solution to stuffy nose. So grab some seawater.

**Speaker D:** It's kind of, it's kind of expensive to get some from Thailand right now. I have to jump through a lot of to get Thailand's— well, the specific.

**Speaker B:** Thailand seawater has like better cleansing properties, so we could actually start a business.

**Speaker D:** Like, there's a Thai restaurant up the road and I'm gonna ask them if they have any sea water.

**Speaker B:** I'm just gonna start mixing some salt and water together and I'm gonna put Thailand on it and I'm gonna start an international business and start shipping.

**Speaker D:** People would buy it. It's good for what ails you.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so on that note, I think I'm going to head out now. It's good to see everyone.

**Speaker A:** Good to see you, Scott. Great seeing you, Scott.

**Speaker D:** Bye, Scott.

**Speaker B:** Bye, everyone.

**Speaker E:** Well, I guess before I head off, I'm going to ask one quick question for the four of you, if you have time. When you all are practicing meditation, what sorts of insights come along and how often do they come along? I'm letting this question be as open as possible just because I'm trying to see how you all interact with your meditation practice on a daily basis, and when or where, if at all, insight states arise.

**Speaker D:** I'll answer for me first. When I'm meditating, and if a thought or an insight arises, I usually just let it pass by or ignore it. I don't actually cling to the insight because I find that that goes back into thinking again, because my goal is not a goal, but my sitting practice is about relaxing in the breath. And so I'm more allowing that relaxation to continue to grow. And spread. So for me, any insights that might arise, I might put a pin in it for later, but I don't want to have that insight or think that insight because it's going to pull me right out of Jhana. It's going to pull me right out of my states that I've been cultivating. So yeah, for me personally, I don't entertain any insights whilst in meditation. No.

**Speaker E:** Fair enough.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, that's my experience anyway.

**Speaker E:** I think maybe my question was a little off then. Rather than distinct thoughts about insights, other than attaining enlightenment and reducing suffering, of course, what are some in-the-moment benefits, I guess? What do you get out of meditating while meditating?

**Speaker B:** Satisfaction.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Right here and now.

**Speaker D:** Nothing to do and nowhere to go. Nowhere to go. I don't know, it's satisfaction. It's the, this breath is good enough. Once you click in, it's just a sustained clicking. There's not a lot of grabbing like meditation prizes. It's not a grab, it's not a catch grab, it's none of that. It's more of this moment is beautiful and so is this, until you no longer even have to name it anymore. There's no discursive thought. And that time you're just literally clicked into a flow, the flow of life, the flow of breathing, the flow of the universe, the flow of the Dharma, whatever. There's just— that in itself seems like such a reward. I can't really conceive of any other ones. Yeah, and if they are there, they make themselves apparent in more— in like the Sati awakening throughout my daily life. Like this thing about feeling sick and like enjoying that experience. Right? But once you've clicked into a flow, then there's— I don't know, there's nothing else, and there doesn't need to be. Again, there just doesn't need to be anything else. That's great. That's just nice. Yeah. I don't know if that answers your question, but that's my experience with it.

**Speaker E:** No, that more than answers my question. I guess I should say then that a lot of my interest in Buddhism has been kind of philosophical or technical rather than epistemological and actually based on experience.

**Speaker B:** Bye, Vedana.

**Speaker D:** Good seeing you.

**Speaker E:** And that's mainly just because I struggle with meditating. A lot of the time when I meditate, it's almost as if my, like, rumination and suffering actually increases rather than decreases. And so that's sort of made me think of meditation almost like this big scary monster rather than like a friend or the best practice possible.

**Speaker A:** Good seeing that, yes, when we look at it, it does increase the sense that it was in the background per se, or we're doing things to avoid those objects. But it's a success to see all that stuff, that it isn't a failure to see all— there's all that Dukkha. That's the step that first— the— that much of the treatment of a disease is the diagnosis of it. That's if you are unable to diagnose the disease, what will the treatment help? So first, seeing the disease of Dukkha. Yes, there is Dukkha. There is dissatisfaction right now. And when we can see that clearly, that's the first step of the process, right? If someone has cancer, and it's diagnosed, say, as what, allergies, and the treatments are given for allergies, that would be of no benefit to the person that Although the seeing the cancer might be— there might be some fear that arises at first, the person would be much better off seeing the cancer and treating it as that. So seeing that, yes, there is Dukkha, there is dissatisfaction. Woo-hoo! I saw it. Now I can change it. Now I can see the Dukkha and talk myself into a wholesome, no problem state and do that over and over again, relax and no problems, that the mind does have the tendency, it is in the habit of conditioning itself into a very unwholesome, unsafe state. And the practice is seeing that, diagnosing that, and then treating it. And the treatment is immediate. The treatment is, oh, no problems. Oh, where is the Dukkha? Where is the tension in the body? Where are the emotions of the body? Can I play with that? And coming out of that state of dissatisfaction, of fear of something into a state of security.

**Speaker D:** Or, you know, to use my dungeon metaphor, which I really enjoy right now, you got it. In order to know where you are in the dungeon, you have to turn on the light to see where you are before you can start moving to the exit, right? And when you turn on that light initially, you're going to see a lot of Dukkha. There's a lot of stuff going on right where you are initially. And as you develop the good habit of moving towards satisfaction, of tossing out those unwholesome thoughts. But until you turn on the light, you don't even know how much they're right, where you are exactly, where your position is relative to the exit, you know.

**Speaker E:** I think I see what you're saying. Honestly, I guess my main interest at this point is just getting into the, what I'd like to call the second step of meditation, if there is a list of steps beyond just sitting and actually experiencing what's going on. I'd like to hear more, I guess, about the treatment aspect of it in your metaphor. Like, what is there to do other than to sit with the Dukkha realize that it's temporary, decline to cling to it, and then let it pass on, right?

**Speaker B:** To—.

**Speaker A:** We need to make sure that we're actually really waking up to the fact that it's temporary and we're above it. Say that there's the idea that it's temporary and, oh, I'll just suffer through it until it's over, compared to— not that the dukkha is temporary, but but the conditions are temporary, that certain things we don't like are temporary. And, oh, I'm sick and I'll get over it, and I'll just suffer through it, compared to, oh, it's temporary and I can be above all this stuff and I can be happy and satisfied.

**Speaker D:** I can be happy right now. I don't have to wait for something to— I don't have to wait for the conditions to change for me to be happy, because that's the same thing, that's the same trap that people get into with, um, I'll like when they're not, they're not interested in the Dharma or they're not aware of it, and they're just like, oh, I'll finally be happy when I get this promotion, I'll finally be happy when I get this married, or whatever, retirement, or first million dollars. It's the same kind of magical thinking in a way, but it's more associated with, um, having like favorable conditions in their life. But if you step back, like one step back, like what we're talking about now Okay, once these clouds part, then everything's cool and I can be happy again. And it's like, no, you can't wait for— don't wait for the clouds to part. That's an external condition that doesn't need to affect the internal condition of the satisfaction of the Sati. It doesn't necessarily need to. And it just takes constant repetitive practice. I mean, it's It's like, I mean, I know it kind of feels like a grind in the beginning, but it's what is necessary, you know, because think about how habitual your thinking is related to that. I'll give you a quick story. I was talking with a student just this morning who was telling me, you know, how difficult it was for her to relax, how difficult it was for her to relax. And she said, and I don't know why. And I explained to her, her whole life everyone's been telling her it's wrong to relax. Like her parents said, don't relax, right? Her school said, don't relax. Her society said, don't relax. And now someone's just saying relax like it's like so easy, like the snap of a finger. And it's not because it's habitual. It's been ingrained. And it's a relaxing itself is the practice. It's a skill that needs— that should be honed and worked on. And so yeah, it can seem like a repetitive grind at times, but it's one of the best ways out of the dungeon.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I think it's helpful to remember.

**Speaker B:** To enjoy the grind as well, like enjoy the process, like, you know. And when one wakes up to those thoughts, like really bringing that congratulations and like really like just like congratulations and.

**Speaker D:** Success and like really, I think especially.

**Speaker B:** Towards like, you know, the beginning, you know, of even a sit or whatever. But like really just that can be very helpful is just to spend some time with that. When a hindrance is spotted to like.

**Speaker A:** Be like, yeah, this is successful, just seeing it, you know, disidentifying from it. And that's part of the process of.

**Speaker B:** Seeing it and just recognize, okay, cool.

**Speaker D:** And don't underestimate the hindrance of doubt. It's both— doubt is one of those things that can be both sharp and momentary and like very like, oh, this isn't working. Yeah. And it can also be like an underlying kind of, like, I don't know, like an underlying feeling too. Of testing and then seeing it's not working, and testing and seeing it's not working. So the doubt is sort of this hindrance that's like this underneath, it's eroding the foundation of what you're trying to do, of what you're doing. So be super vigilant about doubt because it's a big one. That hindrance is a big one, and it really knocks a lot of folks who just find the path right back off again. Right back off. Even after 2 years or 3 years, they're still struggling a lot with doubt because they're testing to see if it's going to work. And that testing to see if it's going to work, to look for that reward— okay, finally, it's, you know, it's, it's like that horse just keeps bucking you and you're like, okay, wait, that's just doubt again coming back up. And I've handled doubt before. I know you doubt. Let's just sit back down and enjoy this breath. Doubt is a big one. And I know it's a lot of times the questions that you may have, that people have, is rooted in that hindrance. And that's not to say don't have questions, but often those questions are coming out of wanting to quell that hindrance when the best way to quell it is to recognize what it is and toss it out as you do. You know, that's a big one.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that's a good point.

**Speaker E:** Thank you. I mean, I don't really have like a perfect catch-all response to that other than realizing that this is probably where I've been personally for the past couple of years in regards to my interests with Buddhism. I've managed to sit here and there, but the main thing I really do is just read the suttas, just because I feel like when I read them It gives me a lot of hope and insight into how suffering works. But what I probably should do a little more often would be Anapanasati, where I will sit with it and experience how it is personally. But I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Not taking it easy and having it, oh, I get the time to relax and take a load off. Because the mind will make it into something, it's a job to do, and I'm not fulfilling my job right now, what a bad student I am. But we can make it, oh, I just get to chill. That's so nice, I get to chill. Then the mind will be like, oh, what about enlightenment? Will I ever get there? What about these things I've been reading about in the suttas? Am I ever going to get there? And the answer is, you're already here, just let go and relax.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, be careful of those shoulds because it sets up a false expectation, it sets up a lot of internal internal pressure about what— about, like, you know, um, idea— like, reality versus, like, the ideal versus a perfection state or whatever. And that's also not reality. That's not in the present moment. So be aware of the should. And yeah, I think it's helpful to try and reframe it, as you said, Parker. Oh, finally, now is a great opportunity to enjoy the breath. For 10 minutes or 15 minutes, not, oh my God, it's 6 PM and I haven't meditated at all today. It's just like, oh, I'm— yeah, I'm not doing it right. I'll never do it right.

**Speaker A:** I'm never going to come like this.

**Speaker D:** Here comes doubt again. Doubt comes right back in. Shoulds, shoulds and expectations set doubt up. Doubt like becomes really, really strong and it pierces through things. Instead of going, oh wow, look at that, I could watch 20 minutes of a show, or I could just sit down for 10 and enjoy the breath. Oh, it's a great opportunity to do that. Why not? Sure, why not? Instead of anything else. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And Caleb, I think this deserves great congratulations, the fact that you can realize that that this wanting to learn or fear of meditation maybe kept you away from it, that that is not something to feel guilty about. That is something to rejoice in the fact that you're able to see that, that we often have the idea that, oh, what a bad person I was for making that mistake for so long and not fixing it. But there's the quote, you can hear the quote, but then you can actually realize it. I don't remember who it's from or what, but the best time to plant a tree was 100 years ago or something like that, and the second best time is now. That this moment— you're smiling, so I see that you get it a little bit— this moment is all that we have. So, right here, right now, and that's the practice. It's immediate.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I mean, our locus of control is ever so infinitely bound to the present. So considering trying to change the past or plan for the future is almost.

**Speaker B:** Fruitless, but we do it anyway.

**Speaker D:** We do it anyway, right? We do it anyway. And one of the great temptations is to, especially with our Western sort of intellectual scientific proclivity, is to like try and map everything out first and say, oh, I know that this is the best thing for me to do because I figured it all out. But I hate to say it like this, but that's procrastination in a lot of ways. That's procrastination. That's waiting for conditions to be right again, or waiting to, oh, I just need to figure this one more thing out and then the equation makes sense and then I can sit down and practice perfectly. It's like there is no such thing. There's no such thing as perfect practice. There's no such thing as perfect anything. Right? Not like that. Not like that. It's going to be in the moment. It's already perfect without any judgments on it, without any categories or labels. And the more you recognize it through the enjoyment of the breath, the more you realize that there's no need for expectations. Right? It's already perfect. It's already sweet. It's already amazing. It's already wonderful. Like, that's it. That's what we got. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** I mean, as long as we can.

**Speaker D:** Remember philosophical— I mean, philosophy and stuff is really fun. It's like, it's like chewing bubble gum with your brain. It's fun. It's juicy, but it's not really sustaining, right? It doesn't fill you up. It will not satisfy you. Philosophy will not satisfy you. It's just, it's a fun game. It's a fun thought.

**Speaker A:** The flavor of the bubble gum runs out. You'll need another stick.

**Speaker D:** Exactly right, exactly right, you know.

**Speaker E:** And then you've been chewing bubble gum for a week and you're starving.

**Speaker D:** Precisely, precisely. And then someone comes along and they offer you a new flavor and say, they say, this will sustain you. Try existentialism. Try this version of existentialism, right? Try this version of, you know, whatever. And you go, okay, I'll try this. This is the one that'll fill me up. This is the one I'm sure.

**Speaker A:** In practice, that was the problem. It was not Anapanasati. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker D:** And then you start chewing again. You're like, wait a second, this is just— this tastes like the other flavors. It's not sustainable. It doesn't fill you up. It doesn't bring you joy and satisfaction long-lasting, you know. It's fun. It's fun like a movie. It's fun. It's a momentary distraction while you, you know, move through that experience, but then, then it's done. And you're still like, oh man, I don't feel satisfied.

**Speaker E:** So you're telling me that all of the suttas are just a long-winded advertisement for sitting meditation?

**Speaker D:** In a way, I think that the suttas are a way of helping people, you know, like practically see that, like help them with Sati, not necessarily in formal practice, but help them see in different situations about that, right? I'm right. It's, it's, it's a way of giving them a kind of like a cheat sheet into, oh, okay, I've seen that other people have seen this exact same situation, and here's their advice relative to that. That's what I think the suttas can be about. Yes, yes, yes, yes. But not necessarily an advertising for meditation, but meditation is strongly recommended. Yeah, actual practice is strongly recommended because then you won't just have to believe it on faith of, oh, it's going to work. You've experienced it, you know it does. There's no such thing as— it's like no one needs to have faith in gravity, do they? You know, it's just a straight-up fact. It's a brute fact of the world, right? It's a straight-up brute fact. It is there, whatever it is, right? I mean, come on, no one's arguing that. No one's arguing against it either. There's no theorizing about it. It's just what it is. So it's the same thing with the Dharma. Once you get to a certain point, there's no debating about it anymore. There's no need for that anymore. It's just a brute fact. It's an experiential thing, though, not an intellectual thing. Not, oh, it makes sense to me. Oh, I can see how that's true. No, no, it You feel it. You just feel it. You move through the world with it. Yeah, you're not separated anymore. You're not. It's not an objective reality, like, "Oh.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah, that's true.".

**Speaker D:** No, I mean, you're like, "Oh man, I am it, and it is me." Like that. Like that. Yeah. Anyway. I hope that made sense.

**Speaker B:** It did.

**Speaker D:** Okay.

**Speaker E:** I think I needed to just have a little bit more of a grounded perspective for how this kind of stuff works. I always thought that if I had read just a little more, I'd find one key little tidbit that would help explain that.

**Speaker D:** That'll tip it. That'll tip it. Now the conditions will finally be right for me to feel comfortable to practice Now finally, but that basket never gets full, does it? It never quite gets full because you're just chewing gum with your brain. Yeah, you're just chewing gum. Yeah, it's all right. I've been there too. I remember, I remember I went to my first foray into university was philosophy. I was sure I was going to figure it out that way.

**Speaker E:** I was a physicist for 2 years in school, but then I decided against that.

**Speaker D:** And then I took one sociology course. It was about social interactionism, and it showed me the link, the symbolic nature of language. And as soon as I took that sociology course, I changed my major from philosophy to religious studies. That one course changed my path, and that's when I discovered Eastern stuff.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, fair enough.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So we all go through this. We all go through this doubt or phase where we're looking for the right practice.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But the key is to see that that itself, that doubt, wanting to know, not knowing enough, that's a sense of dissatisfaction that you need to know more. That there's enough. So we can have guidelines to help us, and those can be beneficial. But needing guidelines is unwholesome, and we actually have to be investigating these guidelines themselves. We have to be using them on our own mind and seeing how does this work, how does— no problems. And when we can practice it and see whether it works or not, it's scientific in that way that that science is practical, that there are tests done, there are experiments done. So instead of looking at the textbook and preparing for the test and preparing for the test and never actually doing the experiment, we need to experiment. And that's the— that is the practice, is looking at reading the book between your two ears. Study that one really well.

**Speaker D:** Hey, Joe.

**Speaker A:** It's good to see you, Joe.

**Speaker E:** I've actually got to go. I'm going to go sit for 15 minutes.

**Speaker D:** Great. Sounds great. Enjoy that.

**Speaker A:** Let it be a time to just relax.

**Speaker D:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Good to see you, Caleb. Bye.

**Speaker D:** See ya.

**Speaker C:** How are you guys all doing?

**Speaker D:** Oh, great. Yeah, I'm dealing with a cold right now, but I'm enjoying that. I'm using that as an opportunity to practice and be aware of the body. So I'm cool with it. Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Cold in the summertime, that's a little odd.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, well, there was a fair amount of you know, moving through crowds and things like that this, like, last weekend because of the holidays. So I'm sure that one of the many people that we probably came in contact with had something, and so it just got passed along. But that's okay. I'm enjoying it. I'm using it as an opportunity to be aware of things. So how about you, Joe? How are you?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I'm good. I had to do some paperwork today. It feels like my paperwork never ends related to my farm. And it was a little bit confusing.

**Speaker A:** And.

**Speaker C:** I just, I kind of like sent an email at the end and I was just like, you know, if I just didn't do this, what would happen?

**Speaker A:** Because like, I just sort of had.

**Speaker C:** This thought, like, because they were like, you need to fill out this paperwork. And I just, I didn't really understand why. And I, and it was such a long thing. It was so many pages. I was like, if I just didn't do it, what, what would happen? And I'm curious to see the response to that.

**Speaker D:** Did you straight up ask them that? Or you just kind of— Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker C:** Because I've been going back and forth for like like 4 months with this person, like, and they just keep sending me paper, you know, it's just how things tend to work when you're dealing with bureaucrats, you know, you like didn't fill out a form and you did fill out a form. So what happened was that I needed to get permission to do something and then I didn't do it at exactly the right time. So then I had to cancel it and then reapply for permission. And I just emailed them and was like, what if I just didn't do that? What if I just don't cancel it and don't reapply? And then when I actually do this thing that I applied for in the first place, like, like that timeframe just comes because it'll take them like a month to respond. And by that time I'll already have done it. And so I don't know, it just is kind of fun playing with them because like their mind is so used to like they're the boss, but they actually don't really have that much power because like What can they really do? I mean, this person doesn't have the power to fine me. They don't have the power to tell me I'm not allowed to do this. So just kind of messing with them a little bit. I'm a little bit tired of paperwork, is all. But that's okay. It's the world that we live in a little bit.

**Speaker D:** It's the dusty world, right? It's the dusty world. And they, and you know, these kinds of forms definitely justify their jobs too, right? If they didn't have forms, they wouldn't have jobs.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Oh my goodness.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker C:** We find a way to make life really, really complicated, you know, and it doesn't really have to be, but it tends to be. I mean, I just, I don't like, I don't feel like I don't feel the sense of authority anymore where I'm scared that something's going to happen in the same way. My reaction is kind of like that where I'm like, "Well, if I just didn't do this, what would happen?" Because I don't actually know what they're going to respond because it's hard to explain. It's like a huge thing. But basically, I have a feeling that I'm kind of right that my original application will just be fine. And if I just like wait, if I stretch out this conversation long enough, my original application will still be valid.

**Speaker D:** You're just gonna wait it out.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, and I'll skip like 20 pages of like saying my name again and my address again and my 2 copies of my passport and my name change documents and all this other stuff.

**Speaker D:** Right, because they are they already have the information they need. That's the thing, they already have it. So I know what you mean, like it seems very empty, like a very futile thing to just give them information on the box they want. It's like, oh, you guys could, I'm sure you could do that. You do it all day. You could do that, can't you?

**Speaker C:** So when they respond in like another couple weeks, my next response is going to be, can I just change the date on the original forms that I sent in because it's going to be the exact same form after I cancel the first one. And then I'm hoping by that time, yeah, the timing will line up. I don't know. I don't really care how it turns out. But it's just insane how much paperwork farmers have to go through. Like, you wouldn't believe it. They make it extremely difficult to do anything on your land because what happens nowadays is they have like drones or not drones, but like they have like aerial satellite pictures of land. And so then they look at these pictures and are like, hey, you like shouldn't be doing this on your land here. This is classified as this kind of land. You're not allowed to plant trees there.

**Speaker D:** You can't have an alligator pond on your land. What are you doing?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah. And I guess it comes from a good place because they want to make sure people aren't just like destroying the countryside. But for people who like actually want to like help the environment and are really into ecology and this sort of thing, it's really limiting because they come up with these strict sort of like, okay, this is land where you grow corn and this is land where you do this. And you're like, okay, well, what if I want to plant trees and grow crops like in between those trees and have like a natural ecosystem that functions kind of like how ecosystems function? And it's just like so far out of their realm of thinking that they're like, how do we track that with our Google Images satellite.

**Speaker D:** It's like, not my— that's really not my problem. Yeah, I could, I could take you some snapshots with my phone and send it in. How about that? Then you could get the sideways view. Oh man. Yeah, it's interesting. That's really interesting that you say like they're trying to err on the side of caution against damage, but they also don't want any progressiveness either. So they're like, in order to protect themselves. Yeah, it's, you know, it's kind of like the immune system of the body, right? There could be like a really awesome substance that could help out the body. But if the immune system doesn't recognize it that way, it's going to kick it out the same way. You're like, no, no, this is something I wanted. And the body's like, nope, nope, sorry, we're just being safe. We're just trying to make sure. Yeah, I hear you.

**Speaker A:** Bureaucrats, that's the way rules are. They limit, and it's not just limiting as intended, that when you draw a box, there are other limits that come with that as well, whether it be the satellites that allow you to— that they don't have a specific category to put you in, so you can't be creative with the farm. So we can just see them. It's about working with them skillfully. With anything, it's about working with it skillfully rather than resenting it, because that's the habit we've been trained into.

**Speaker C:** At the end of the day, they really— they don't have that much power because like nobody has ever— well, there's been a couple people have come out to my land, but not like— like they're not ever going to. And there's so much land that like is just kind of like lost because basically what happens is people die and then they don't really know who inherited the land. And there's a lot of land in the world that just like nobody really knows who owns it. And like somebody's kind of doing something with it, but it's kind of like off the radar. So kind of like the key, like, is to try to stay off the radar as much as possible and just fade into the background because, you know, you're just not— you're not doing anything too wrong. And the main thing is, is like you just have good relationships with your neighbors. Because they're the ones that are going to turn you in for doing something wrong, you know, theoretically. But as long as you have a good relationship with your neighbors, like, you.

**Speaker A:** Know, that's— that's the bureaucrat when they come along. Invite them in, serve them some delicious farm food, make best friends with them.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I grew this right under my trees. So you really don't want— you really don't have a farm, you're trying to convert it into a park with crops is what you're doing.

**Speaker C:** That's pretty much— actually, that is pretty much it. Yeah.

**Speaker D:** You're like, listen, we need to reclassify what I have here. It's not a farm, it's a park with crops on it. Okay, how about that? Do you have a little box for that?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I mean, a lot of people have problems with this. I mean, like, I was just watching somebody talk about a wilding project that they had in the UK Wilding is taking my ideas but even more extreme to where you're just doing nothing. So you take farmland and you just do nothing, and you manage some animals a little bit here and there, but otherwise you cut off all inputs, you just don't do anything, you don't plant anything. The idea is if you have a farm that's losing money and you just stop doing things, then you're not losing money anymore. So whatever you do has to be better than what you were doing before, and it's better for the environment because you're not growing crops and plowing the ground and doing all this stuff. But anyways, yeah, they don't really have a category for this. And a lot of people who are doing this, they run into issues with, yeah, how to classify what exactly is going on, even though that it's clearly like a huge ecological benefit. And if you talk to people, they're like, like, why wouldn't we want unproductive farmland to go back into wilderness? Like, that sounds like a great thing, you know? But it just sort of like blows people's mind where they're like, but how does the farm make money? And you're like, well, the farm hasn't made money for like, you know, year.

**Speaker A:** After year after year.

**Speaker C:** It's just, you know, you just stop not losing money and then, oh, all of a sudden in 20 years you have a place that looks like a park and people want to go to. So this one place, it's kind of like a model in the UK, it's like a 1,200-hectare, 5,000-acre farm that was very unprofitable and they just stopped doing things. Now they run safaris there and they make a lot more money running safaris and having people drive around and look at the wild animals that have moved in there than they ever did growing crops. So, yeah, I mean, there's all kinds of rooms for creativity and stuff like this, but And I think moving forward, I mean, you can feel that people who get into agriculture more and more, they have to come up with new ideas because everybody realizes the systems we have are like just extremely broken. And yeah, there has to be a better way forward.

**Speaker D:** You think that those bureaucratic forms would just have a big box that says N/A. I mean, every form I've ever seen has N/A. Yeah, just mark that. It's not applicable. None of these categories are applicable. So it's just N/A, straight up N/A, or whatever the French equivalent to that is.

**Speaker C:** It's like this everywhere. I think the only place it's not like this is in developing countries where it's still in— if you live in— there's a Thai farmer that I like, and he's lived in America for a little while, and he makes his YouTube videos kind of He's Buddhist and a little philosophical about it. The one thing he said is he's like, "You know, in America, if you want to extend your roof a foot, you've got to go through this massive process. In Thailand, if you want to build a house, you just go up to your neighbor and you're like, 'Hey, can I build a house over there?'" They're like, "Sure." It's just such a different thing that's going on. Where is freedom really? Is it really freedom? Free in America or these places that.

**Speaker D:** You know, have a dictatorship? And I think we know that that was, that was something that's, that's been sold to the American public for a long time now. I think, I think we know that that's, there's a lot of, there's a lot of, um, yeah, it's a very tight definition of that. Yeah, I think it's very obvious about freedom here.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that, um, this is sort of, uh, bringing it back to the Dhamma, the idea of wrong view ordinary right view and supermundane right view, that wrong view is no rules, complete anarchy, nothing. Everyone's thinking unwholesomely, a bunch of monkeys. The middle would be rights, rules, and rituals, people doing things, superstition, clinging to— clinging to if I follow these bureaucratic papers, I'll be OK. And then the supermundane is What's the problem with the world? Problem with it? I can let it grow and be fine and eat off that. So yes, that is unwholesome. It's not liberating, this ordinary view. But we can also sort of be grateful in a way that there are some systems. It's not complete anarchy. Somehow we're able to talk to each other, that some bureaucracy is in place. As dysfunctional as it may be, that gets internet going. And I can talk to you from Arizona to France. So in a way, we can be grateful because in complete anarchy, imagine getting something like internet set up. Even if everyone was noble thinking, people probably wouldn't care enough to get the internet set up, that everything's okay the way it is. So looking at that, each has its pros and cons that for someone who is noble and everyone else is thinking ordinarily, life can be made fairly easy with internet and ordering food and whatever it may be. And it's— you can't really speculate on completely noble societies because there is really no example of that, or if so, it's not very publicized.

**Speaker D:** Uh, but oh, they wouldn't even need to keep records. They wouldn't even need to keep records. Why would they even need a library?

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker D:** So what would be the point?

**Speaker A:** Just a bunch of happy folks. They wouldn't even need to name themselves.

**Speaker D:** No, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's a good point, Parker.

**Speaker A:** We've got grateful that we have some systems. And wow, I can go to a store that, like we've talked about, and I can pick up whatever food I want. Even though the way it's being gotten is probably fairly unwholesome. Go ahead, Rick.

**Speaker D:** No, no, that's a good point. Like, you've got, you know, internet and delivery apps, but we've also got climate change. So, you know, go figure. It's all a balance, right? Incredible convenience and also a lot of consequences for that convenience. So, yeah.

**Speaker A:** This is being able to— this was like the Eight Worldly Winds that we were talking about earlier in the conversation before you were here, Joe, that the list is in front of me: gain and loss, fame and disgrace, praise and blame, pleasure and pain. That the ordinary person, the Puttajanana, will cling to either one of these or want it to be a different way. And there is the cycle of Samsara. I'm famous. Oh yeah, I'm really enjoying fame. The fame isn't permanent, it goes away. Oh, now I'm disgraceful. I don't really like that. I'm clinging to not being disgraceful. And there's the circle. So in the same way, recognizing with worldly conditions that this is sort of pleasure and pain, convenience and inconvenience, that yes, life will sometimes be inconvenient and recognizing it as that, that there is inconvenience, but not wishing it would be different or liking or disliking it either way. That just seeing it as something. And same with convenience. Wow, my life is really convenient. I'm very grateful for that. Just that, instead of it's convenient right now and I really like this and my life, because it's impermanent, it might fade away.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, exactly. It might, it might.

**Speaker A:** That we might go into anarchy. Uh, it's not very likely with all the people that are clinging to all the rules and stuff that are in place. But if we are in anarchy, can you be happy in anarchy? Can you find a safe way to live and satisfied to live, way to live in anarchy?

**Speaker D:** In nuclear winter, can you be satisfied in nuclear winter?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you could enjoy the bomb as it goes off in the big show.

**Speaker D:** It's the flash of a lifetime.

**Speaker A:** I mean, really nice.

**Speaker C:** I think that would actually be on it. That would actually be a moment that would be very easy to because you really would know your mortality, right? Because like one of the issues with why we struggle to enjoy is because we don't know our mortality. But when you're on the brink of dying, like, you know, you kind of, you have to enjoy. I mean, that's my reaction as a practitioner, at least. Like, I guess some people freak out and like cling to life.

**Speaker A:** Depends on how strong the self-preservation instinct is, right? And if we can see it or not.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, but I mean, I've definitely had some moments like I was camping once and I got stuck on the other side of a river with no water and no food. But I mean, we had water from the river because it had— basically I was stuck in a monsoon and I had no cell phone, no food, and I was kind of screwed, you know, like slightly scared about dying because like trees are like falling down and stuff. You know, but it strangely felt like really calm for me. The other person I was with was freaking out a little bit, but for me, I was just like, oh man, like you kind of like quickly like look back on everything and are like, wow, it all could just end right here. And you know, this is it.

**Speaker A:** There's exactly that. There's no me that's ending, that we're not clinging to something. And scared that it's going to go. That all the fear comes from something we're clinging to, and we're scared that by death or whatever coming, that it's going to end. And that's the ignorance. So if we can see that ignorance, that's why it's called deathless. That there is no me, I, me, or mine that is born. So there is no I, me, or mine to die. I'm grateful to have some good friends here and have the internet to connect us and not have a fear of death right now, that everything's okay right now, no problems. You guys are wonderful.

**Speaker D:** All right, gents. Well, I've got to get going. So it's good to see everybody for quite a while today, actually. Yeah. But anyway, y'all have a great week, a peaceful week, satisfying week. And I will catch you on the other side.

**Speaker A:** Great. Good seeing you, Rick.

**Speaker D:** Bye, guys. Bye.

**Speaker A:** I think I'll head out too.

**Speaker B:** That was a good note to end it on.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, likewise. For anyone watching the video, feel free to check out the Discord. Check out these calls. Everyone's welcome to join. It's just a Skype link. Great.

**Speaker C:** See you guys.

**Speaker A:** Great to see you, Joe. Great to see you, DJ.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's good to see you, Parker and Joe.

**Speaker A:** Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato and Sangha friends, revolves around several interconnected themes central to the practical application of Buddhist teachings. Here is a concise summary of the key points discussed:

### **Core Themes**

1.  **Two Types of Action: "Rites & Rituals" vs. "The Wise Doing"**
    *   The discussion begins by distinguishing between actions driven by societal "rites, rules, and rituals" (often clung to out of habit, duty, or expectation of future reward) and actions undertaken with clear, present-moment wisdom ("the wise doing").
    *   Clinging to rites and rituals (*silabbata paramasa*) is identified as a fetter, especially when the immediate benefit isn't seen. True practice, like mindful eating, is for the benefit of understanding and calming craving *here and now*.

2.  **The Primary Duty: Happiness and Liberation**
    *   A central, recurring idea is that for one on the Dhamma path, the **only true duty is to the Dhamma itself—which is synonymous with liberation from suffering and cultivating happiness.** The ultimate goal is to dedicate one's life to "simply just being happy" and awake to the immediacy of sensory experience.
    *   Societal duties and identities (e.g., "I am a dishwasher") are to be understood practically (to secure food and shelter) but not clung to as "I, me, or mine." The path is likened to breaking free from psychological fences to "frolic in the meadow."

3.  **The Origin of Suffering: Mental Proliferation vs. Reality**
    *   Using a personal story (waiting for a text reply on a train), the group illustrates how suffering (*dukkha*) arises not from the event itself, but from the mental stories, fears, and clinging to self-concept we build around it.
    *   The solution is **mindfulness (*sati*) and right view**: seeing thoughts as just thoughts, not identifying with them, and relaxing into the present moment where "no permission from others is needed to be happy."

4.  **The Eight Worldly Winds & Impersonal Forces**
    *   The group discusses the "eight worldly conditions" (gain/loss, fame/disgrace, praise/blame, pleasure/pain) as **impersonal, ever-changing forces like the weather**. Suffering comes from taking them personally, blaming oneself or others, or clinging to favorable conditions. The wise person learns to reside in an internal peace unaffected by these shifting winds.

5.  **Meditation Practice: The "Exit," Not Mapping the "Dungeon"**
    *   Formal practice (*ānāpānasati*) is emphasized not as a striving for special insights or states, but as cultivating **immediate satisfaction and relaxation** with the breath—"nothing to do and nowhere to go."
    *   A powerful metaphor is offered: **"Don't map out the dungeon; just go for the exit."** This means not over-intellectualizing suffering or philosophy, but directly practicing the way out through present-moment awareness and contentment.
    *   The hindrance of **doubt** is highlighted as a major obstacle, often disguised as endless questioning or waiting for the "right conditions" to practice.

6.  **Using Life's Challenges as Dhamma Opportunities**
    *   A participant shares how a mild cold became an opportunity to practice awareness of the body and acceptance, rather than resistance. This exemplifies the attitude of **using all experiences—even unpleasant ones or bureaucratic hassles—as fuel for waking up** and seeing the mental habits of aversion.

### **Overall Tone and Message**
The talk is practical, down-to-earth, and encouraging. It consistently steers away from abstract philosophy toward **direct experience and application**. The repeated message is that freedom and happiness are available right now by shifting one's relationship to experience: letting go of clinging to rules and self-identity, seeing through mental proliferation, and choosing to relax into a satisfied, mindful presence regardless of external conditions. The path is framed as a joyful liberation into the simplicity of being awake.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key metaphors and stories used:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Cattle Ranch / Fenced Paths:** Used by Speaker B to describe societal duties, rules, and rituals. Society is likened to a ranch with fenced-in paths that cattle must follow. Breaking free from "rites and rituals" is compared to escaping these fences to "frolic in the meadow" as a "happy little cow."
    *   **Purpose:** To contrast constrained, conditioned living with the freedom and natural joy of following the Dhamma.

2.  **The Dungeon:** Used by Speaker D (and expanded by others) to represent the complex, suffering-filled state of ordinary, unawakened life. The key advice is "don't map out the dungeon, just go for the exit."
    *   **Purpose:** To emphasize that over-intellectualizing suffering (mapping the dungeon) is less important than practically moving toward liberation (the exit). It critiques getting lost in philosophical complexity instead of practicing.

3.  **The Hurricane / Eye of the Hurricane:** Used to describe the impersonal, chaotic nature of the "eight worldly winds" (gain/loss, fame/disgrace, etc.). The practitioner can learn to reside in the calm "eye," unaffected by the storm of changing conditions.
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate how external conditions are impersonal forces like weather, and wisdom allows one to find peace amidst them without being "blown away."

4.  **Chewing Bubble Gum with Your Brain:** Used by Speaker D to describe intellectual philosophy and over-reliance on suttas without practice. It's "juicy" and fun but not nourishing or sustaining.
    *   **Purpose:** To distinguish between intellectual understanding (which doesn't satisfy) and experiential practice (which does). The "flavor runs out," leaving you hungry.

5.  **Virtuous Peacock / Showmanship:** Used to describe performative morality—acting good to be *seen* as good by society, rather than acting from genuine goodwill.
    *   **Purpose:** To critique the ego-inflation and "lunacy" of social virtue-signaling, which is contrasted with the authentic happiness that comes from true good intentions.

6.  **Engineering a Mechanism:** Speaker B describes the mind's feeling mechanism as something that can be seen, deconstructed, and intentionally engineered to feel a desired way (e.g., happy, satisfied).
    *   **Purpose:** To frame meditation and mindfulness as a skillful, almost technical process of retraining habitual emotional responses.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **Robert's Train Story (shared by Speaker A):** A "stereotypical Dharma story" where Robert (Speaker B) got anxious and upset on a train because someone didn't text him back. When the apology finally came, his mental suffering ended, but the external situation (being on a train) hadn't changed.
    *   **Purpose:** To provide a concrete, relatable example of how suffering is created by the mind's projections, clinging, and stories (fear of social rejection) rather than by the situation itself.

2.  **Rick's Mild Cold:** Speaker D shares how he used the physical discomfort of a cold as an opportunity for practice—awareness of the body and a chance to "wake up" with each cough—rather than resisting it.
    *   **Purpose:** To demonstrate how any condition, even an unpleasant one, can be used as a field for practice and finding satisfaction without needing circumstances to change.

3.  **Joe's Bureaucratic Paperwork:** Speaker C tells a story about frustrating farm paperwork, playing with the bureaucrats by asking, "What if I just didn't do this?" and musing on the inflexibility of systems.
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate the "dusty world" of rites, rules, and rituals (Silabhatta) and how a practitioner can relate to it with playful detachment and skillfulness rather than resentment.

4.  **The Thai Farmer Comparison:** Joe contrasts the heavy regulation of building in America with the simple, neighborly permission process in Thailand.
    *   **Purpose:** To question conventional notions of "freedom" and highlight how societal structures (rites and rituals) can create their own forms of bondage.

5.  **The Student Who Couldn't Relax:** Speaker D briefly mentions a student who found it hard to relax because her whole life (parents, school, society) had told her "don't relax."
    *   **Purpose:** To show how deeply conditioned our habits of striving and dissatisfaction are, and that relaxation is a skill that must be consciously retrained.

**Overall Theme:** The metaphors and stories consistently contrast two ways of being: one is constrained, habitual, and suffering-prone (the cattle fence, the dungeon, the hurricane's winds, chewing gum, the peacock's show). The other is free, mindful, and satisfied (the open meadow, the dungeon exit, the eye of the storm, nourishing food, authentic happiness). The anecdotes provide everyday examples of moving from the former to the latter through the application of Dhamma practice.
