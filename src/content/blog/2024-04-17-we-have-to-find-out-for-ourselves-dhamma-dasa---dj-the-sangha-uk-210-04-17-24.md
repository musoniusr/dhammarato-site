### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, I believe it started.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Yeah, we were just talking about nature and walking, for anybody watching. But yeah, it was great, man. I like to go to the, to different cemeteries, And I don't stay too long usually. I just kind of go in and out.

**Speaker B:** But.

**Speaker A:** Oddly enough, I heard Dolly Parton, an audio from Dolly Parton, say that she liked going to cemeteries because they're well kept and, you know, it's nature and it's interesting because there's history there to see all the graves and stuff and different dates on them. And I couldn't agree more with her. It's just such a peaceful, relaxing place, and there's not many people there. So you got like this beautiful scenery all to yourself. So I highly recommend anybody who wants to spend time in nature, definitely check out the graveyards because it's an untapped resource of peace.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think I remember my mom saying that good place to go for a picnic because of the reasons you, uh, yes, in terms of it being well-tapped.

**Speaker A:** Yes, my mom used to take me, uh, I'd go to work, I'd drive in the car to work with her sometimes, and we would go to graveyards and have lunch there. Long John Silver's, remember that place? I don't know, well, maybe you don't remember, you're from Canada.

**Speaker B:** I remember, um, I've been there like once And that was— oh, it had to be like 6 or 7 years ago now, but back when I was driving a transport truck. So I was going through the states, stopped at Anagami.

**Speaker A:** That's awesome. Yeah, um, earlier last— yesterday and a little earlier today, man, I was having like, um, a Piti experience. That was seemed like different than like, different than before, because I got, I just, and it's funny, like I didn't even care to call it anything. But as I was going through it, I'm like, hey, man, this is like a real Piti experience I'm having right now, like a real, like something was eating at me in my mind. And I just was doing the Eightfold Noble Path practice, and it just went away. And it really— there was something subtly different about it where I really did get a feeling like, wow, like this is real. Like I always said it was real. I always know it's real. But something was weird this time. Because I guess this thing was weighing so heavily on my mind, and then like the fact that I just changed it and it wasn't weighing on my mind, and I'm like, I can be peaceful without needing this thing that I don't have, and blah, blah, blah, you know. And it was really wonderful. It was like a— it was like a— it was different. All I can say is like it was different than the other ones I've had. The other ones were like almost logically like, wow, I can do this. But this one was— I really, inside my, like, essence, was like, man, I— it's— I can really, uh, be content without this stuff. That's really cool, man. Anyways, oh yeah, give me a big boost of, like, uh, Dhamma inspiration.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting. Yeah, when that comes up, and especially like, like you said, like after, you know, you're kind of going through, you know, something, but being able to actually see it, you know, change and like really have that direct insight into that is, yeah, it's really reassuring. Oh yeah, you really can do this. It's, I mean, it's something too. And like, when it comes to any of these experiences, I find like, especially when we're talking about like, the real feeling aspect, because like, sometimes, you know, practicing, you know, if I'm like in seclusion, and I'm working it in, it's just, or it's being worked in, you know, it can feel so good. And one actually, like, it actually feels you know, incredibly pleasant, right? But yeah, that kind of gives like, wow, this really can be done. One can actually just feel really good. And again, this is beyond like the discursive thought. This is more like a direct felt, like, you know, through the body, like kind of thing. And yeah, that kind of gives a degree of like, yeah, you know what, just being able to be content without anything really does give rise to that joy and fulfillment. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** That'S well said, man. Yeah, it's ironically, even though there's like no soul, it's like you almost feel it in your soul. But when Westerners say that, what we really mean is like you feel it in your heart, the heart of your being, so to speak.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it depends, I guess, context of what one means by soul. So yeah, yeah, we do often mean it like heart, right?

**Speaker A:** So yeah, yeah, you feel it in your bones, man. Yeah, and that's great too. It's very tricky to be a human being sometimes because you society just wraps your head around in that. You really do. It appears difficult. It's not difficult, but it can appear difficult to some people, especially if they're.

**Speaker B:** Not in the Dhamma.

**Speaker A:** It's like it really does get you tangled in its spider web of always needing something you don't have, always wanting something you don't have. And there's lots of people who go their whole lives without hearing the fact that like, wait, you don't need any of that. Like, that's not a way to live. That's not a way to be. And so yeah, the fact that you can hear the Dhamma and practice it is such another thing to, in a way, to rejoice over and be joyful over. Yeah, just quite lovely, just really nice. And yeah, just feel pretty happy about all of it, basically.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, to just be content, be okay. And then through that, just being content and being okay, like joy really does arise, that feeling of success.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And yeah, it's interesting too, because like before actually the call for a little bit, you know, in terms of like mood and attitude, things have been, you know, good on my end. But I did was kind of going through a little bit of a sad thing for a little bit. I said, okay, I'm just gonna let myself be sad for a little bit. But it still kind of works it out. Like even when going through that, there's still like this wisdom of like understanding, well, it's a lot of bullshit. You know, yeah, but it is like what you say about like, you know, especially when engaging with like the conventional sort of world, right? There's so much in terms of you need to have this in order to be happy, you need to be somebody in order to be happy, you need to be some idealized version of yourself in order to be happy, right? Or this thing, and you can't be happy without any of these things, right? And so I think for me, it was sort of like coming to also like, yeah, I know, I can be content, I can be happy, you know, without any of these things, right? But there is a sense where like one really It almost did feel like a grieving of identity there and just being like, well, it's okay. So again, it works itself out. But there's like, you know, to a certain degree, there's like these conditionings that one goes through, I guess, but it's just like seeing through them and working through them like one at a time, right? And so But for the most part, I mean, that's again, it's funny because afterwards I was talking to my mom, right? And she was like, oh, you seem like kind of down. And she was talking to me a bit about it. And yeah, I said, yeah, but it's okay, right? And then afterwards, she was like, oh, you know, you're sad about it. I'm like, I'm not sad anymore. Like, you just turned around. Like, yeah, just because I go through a little bit of sadness doesn't mean I need to be sad all day, right? Or And I say I go through sadness. It's really just a process, right? There's some sadness there.

**Speaker C:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like, it's really just the body. It's these conditionings. And like, again, it's sort of like, for me, or I say, it's like looking and being like, it's okay to be sad for a little bit. Right. But then also, over it, I can be glad to like, yeah, and being.

**Speaker A:** Sad can be kind of fun. Yeah, it adds some artistic spice to life. It doesn't have to be something even to run away from, as long as you're not physically acting out on these things to cause more Dukkha for other people. If you can be okay with sadness, anger, fear, delusion being spices of life, then what's the problem? You know what I mean? As long as you're not hurting yourself or others Yeah, it's— but then again, like, but also in that same hand, it's not falling down the whole slope of sadness. Yeah, it's riding the wave of sadness as opposed to letting the wave of sadness crash you into the corals, you know. It's being one with life, even though as cliché as it sounds, it's being one with life. And not, you know, when you hear about the Dharma, when you get into the practice, in this, in almost the wisdom, our natural wisdom that's there from the beginning, once we're hearing of these things, once we're hearing of the Dharma, it almost brings us into an autopilot. Because it's like, just like you were saying, you were sad, it's like the fact that we already are aware of wisdom, in a weird way, it's almost like you don't even need to practice because however you feel, it's okay. It's like there's nothing that needs to be done. It's like just hearing about the Dhammas can almost free one. Like, sure, you have to practice and you'll always be practicing, but that's kind of the practice is like, well, if you're okay with life as it is, then what's there to change? It's like, the person who wants to change being sad is not okay with being sad once in a while. And those are the most sad people. Those are the most depressed people. It's like, I don't like this feeling. I want things to be different. But our natural wisdom is like, just from practicing the Dharma, is like, yeah, you're gonna feel sad. Well, that's chemicals in the body. And It can even be something that's artistic and fun. It doesn't need to be something we have to get rid of. And then you're like, oh, 2 seconds later, I'm not sad anymore because I'm okay with being sad. Like, sometimes it feels good.

**Speaker B:** Like, well, yeah, that's it, you know. And I think like, again, yeah, it's like the balance, right? Where it's like, I mean, most of the time, right, it's like directing the mind towards the wholesome, and really being like chill with that and like feeling good and like, yeah, you know what, I don't have to go there, right? That's most of the time, right? But here, but, you know, sometimes it's just like, hey, you know what, let's go and see that sadness and be like, well, actually, it's not really worth continually going on about this either. Right. So I like, okay, you know what, right now it's safe to do so. We're just going to go in the sadness for a moment and then be like, yeah, it's not really worth it. But there's still again, yeah, that wisdom going on of this doesn't need to ruin the whole day. This doesn't need to be a forever thing. Even the thoughts that come up, you know, they're delusional thoughts that can be seen as delusional thoughts. It's like, yeah, sadness is something that's kind of arising, but it's going, you know, it's not impersonal still, like all this stuff, like even as these thoughts of wanting things and all this other stuff, it's all seen as impersonal, right? It's like really at the end of the day, and like, it's also having that knowledge of like, you know, none of these things really do lead to happiness, right? But it's weird because like, I say it's weird, I mean, it really just is what it is, right? Because weirdness is just a perception that I'm throwing on, or that's being thrown upon it. But in reality, right, it's like, it really is just what it is, what it is, right? But then there can even be a subtle aversion to that, like with that sort of, you know, one could say like empty sort of aspect, you know, how folks are like, oh, I feel empty inside, right? And it's like, I mean, I can notice that with myself from time to time, or even with, you know, practicing this, there's like, that comes up, right? But the problem is, is not that, well, the reason that there's a problem is because there's an aversion to things being, you know, that emptiness, that void, or what have you, like that sort of feeling. It's like, there's an aversion to it, right? Because it's like, oh, well, but what about What about this? What about my— who I am as a person and all these things and making those things important, right? And it's like, oh well, if there isn't that, then there's no meaning or what have you. And then that means that there needs to be an issue, right? But it's the aversion to all these things. When the aversion goes away, when the wanting goes away, then there's no problem, right? And so it's like that understanding of that, which is like really quite I mean, it's liberating in a very profound way because it touches on things that's such a, you know, the heart of the matter where other things might not. They're again, they're really trying to go with the symptoms, right? As opposed to like getting to the heart of the matter here. And that's, yeah, I mean, that's the profound thing about the Dhamma where it's, it's freeing. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And when you say to yourself, like, okay, who needs meaning? Ironically, in a way, in a sense, all this meaning comes flooding in in that moment, and it's always with you if you want it to have it. It's like the kingdom of heaven is there, but we don't see the kingdom of heaven because of bad habits, because of our Kamma, Samskara. We don't see these things. And that's why sometimes in Zen that they put sometimes a lot of emphasis on the physical world, but what they're really saying is just how we do the Eightfold Path with Anapanasati. They're bringing it back to earth, they're bringing it back to the elements, bringing it back to the breath. And it's not that thoughts and feelings, emotions aren't— they're all part of the Dhamma, although the they may be at closer inspection somewhat illusory. It's all the Dharma. And like when you are chopping vegetables, when you are gardening, you know, the Buddha was like, pay attention to these moments, observe these moments, because look at the stark contrast. A minute ago you had all these illusion things in your head. That's fine. But when you're gardening, do you notice how those go away? And that's the same thing as Anapanasati. When you're following the breath, do you notice how there can be clarity, there can be peace? Do you see that? And then you don't take going back— and you always have to naturally kind of have those baby Dukkhas arise, aka thoughts, feelings, emotions that we may see as anger, hatred, delusion, fear, doubt. And when they come up, we're like, oh, but that's okay that they're coming up. That's all part of this whole thing we call life. Then it's just like, oh, I can live with these. Like Dhammarato said, these are your friends, you know. Hello, old friend, you know. It's good to see you again. And it's not taken personally. It's not taken as something to run away from or fight. And it's, yeah, when you see an old friend, it's just like, oh, hey, what's up? You know, it's like there's no problems here.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's if you want to talk about meaning, that's— there's all the meaning right there and right here in this moment of being content, being satisfied. When you go beyond both meaning nor the idea of no meaning whatsoever, That's the true meaning. Who needs meaning? Who cares? Who cares about what meaning? What, I'm going to find some answer and then I'll be satisfied? It's like, no, the feeling of being satisfied is the meaning. It's like the ultimate, not needing anything, not needing to be satisfied one minute or not not satisfied one minute. It's like whatever happens, you're fine.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that's why it's nice to come back to just like being okay, right? So it's like, if sadness comes up, hey, that's okay. You know, if one is feeling joy, right, that's okay, right? But coming back to, hey, it's okay. And then just being able to chill with what is and coming back, yeah, again, to reality, like, like you're saying, it's like it transcends the whole meaning, non-meaning sort of thing, which can get very heady, you know. And that's where, like, yeah, it's like just waking up to what's going on in reality. That's where, like, coming back to the breath frequently is very helpful too, or anything to get out of that, you know, again, over-intellectualization and just being like, okay, no, back to this. And when it's like you know, that's the thing is like, it doesn't matter whether or not there is, you know, meaning or not. If one sees that there is no meaning and they're averse to that, or there is a meaning that they don't like, or what have you, and this is all being fabricated, right, then there's going to be dissatisfaction. But if one's just like, hey, I don't you know, care about that, right? Because in all honesty, the real— again, yeah, the real meaning is, hey, there's dissatisfaction and there's the end of dissatisfaction. And once we see, can't just come back and be satisfied, there you go, right? So then the question doesn't really, um, you know, it's not as potent, right? And it's, it's cool. And I mean, that's the thing, because this— I mean, That's the thing with the Dharma is that it actually leads back to a resolution, if you will, in the way that I mean really other things just can't, because, you know, it's just not the way that reality works in that regard, right? So it's like people can philosophize forever about these things, but, you know, coming back to just being satisfied, coming back to reality and what is really felt, in that regard. I mean, in terms of our experience, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's almost sometimes as if people through society's brainwashing have become accustomed to almost being afraid of peace, of satisfaction, and they label it such things as boredom. They label it as monsters, and it becomes these monsters. They label it as lazy, they label it as sloth, boredom, all these things. And there is lazy and then there's, in a way, one could say like a noble lazy. It's not lazy at all. Like the Buddha, he got so much stuff done. And it's not about doing things or not doing things. It's about when you're practicing, things will naturally happen as they should. You know, yeah, a Buddhist father is not going to neglect his daughter or son. That would go against every— you know what I mean? But he's also not going to drive himself nuts by fixating on anxieties about the future for his children, or, you know what I mean? When things arise, he'll take care of it and do the best he can, and they'll either go the way that they're supposed to or not. And that's the way they're supposed to. They're going to go any way out of his control. So, but, um, yeah, that's all just, uh, man, it's just, I'm just so thankful and blessed that.

**Speaker C:** Uh, yeah, I.

**Speaker A:** Met Dhammarato and I'm able to even practice this stuff because, uh, you really do see how you can be living in a world of illusion if you otherwise haven't. And when you talk to people who don't practice the Dharma, you see it clearly. Like the Buddha said, like, once in a while, check out other people, how they're fixated on all these things, and you're unattached. One, because you're not them, so there's a natural unattachment. But that's why it's a good practice, because look how they freak out about losing their car keys or whatever, and look how unattached you are. But when it's your car keys, then you're the same as them. But see how crazy they're acting from from somebody who has no skin in the game, you can see how maybe they'll find their car keys, maybe they won't, but they shouldn't be freaking out as much as this because it's causing them a lot of Dukkha, it seems, you know. But, um, it's just wonderful that the choice is always there, that you don't have to suffer, you don't have to have dissatisfaction. There's always the choice, you can change it, and that is a profound thing that is easily missed.

**Speaker B:** You know, when you say too, like, the choice is there that you don't have to suffer, that makes me think of like the rules as well, right? Like, there can be from these rules, like, oh, I have to suffer because of this, I have to be dissatisfied, right? And it kind of goes back to sometimes, you know, you're talking about laziness, right? And, you know, even when we're thinking about like the hindrances, right, and there's like sloth and torpor, right? And I think that again is kind of like in regards to, you know, the practice and not applying, you know, sometimes or what have you. But also we have this thing where we can't be restful, right? This is more the issue. Right, where it's like, you know, there's such a thing where it's like you need to be doing more and more and you have to be, you know, constantly doing more and more and this is not enough, right? And you can't just sit down and relax and come to rest, right? Because again, another hindrance is restlessness, right? And so this is again something that's keeping the mind from being able to be satisfied is restlessness, that boredom. That anxiety. And so actually, I think in a way, it's not laziness, but it's restfulness, actually being able to rest, you know, and that's it.

**Speaker A:** The middle way too, it's like, you can be anxiety-ridden about being an overworker workaholic. Or you can sit there, but I think, I think somebody with fresh Western ears who's never heard of the Dhamma, if they hear the rules of things like you know, can't be lazy, no sloth, topor, or whatever. They'll say, oh, they agree with the Western mindset, then we always must be doing something. Well, don't be lazy with your Dharma practice. Yeah, don't be dissatisfied. That's really what that means. And in the middle way, if your kuti is falling apart, it's nothing bad to make some repairs and keep it looking pleasant so other people don't have an eyesore to look at. But at the same sense, You're not fixated on every second, "Oh, I got to make my house perfect. I got to fix everything." It's the middle way.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** It's fixing things when they require it, you know, naturally. And that's the funny thing about the Dharma is when you're practicing it earnestly, there's no questions or rules of how should I, when should I. It all kind of just naturally happens. It's there. That's when we become the adults. We don't need someone to tell us when to fix our kootis, when not to, when to read, when to read the Pali Canon, when not to, when to feel this way, when to feel that. It's like, no, we're in charge. And we're in a balanced way being satisfied and nobody can tell us that we're not. There's no owner of us, like telling us we're adults. And when things arise, We handle them, and the chips and cards will fall where they may, and that's fine. And that's a big problem a lot of people seem to have, or seem to— they've created this so-called problem, is that they have a very psychological Sankhara fixated habit of wanting to control every damn thing. You see it in our Western medicine, you see it in our architecture, you see it in every facet of modernity. Even in people's— it's funny, I was just gardening— but you see it even in people's yards, you know, can't have any weeds, it has to be perfect. You know, it's always fighting nature. Like, I can't have a beard, I have to shave it, right? I have to cut my hair, I can't let that stuff— it's like we're always— and it's not that you can't cut your hair or Dukkha, but my point is we're always— a lot of people in society are always fixated on fighting against what is. You know what I mean? Like, it can't be this way, it can't be this natural way, I must change it, right? Because when I'm changing it, that means that I have some level of control. But really, it's just ignorance. You have a tiny, tiny bit of control. And 99% of stuff is completely just the way things are. And just like the idea of a permanent self, or the self in general, to be honest with you, like Buddha Dasabhikkhu talks about in Heartwood of the Bodhi Tree, like the ego, more so of the self, and it's Yeah, it's there. There's a kind of a self, but it's not very important. It's the fixation on this ego. It's the fixation on the idea itself that's causing the Dukkha. Wanting to make it permanent, wanting to make it special, wanting to make it something that you can build statues to and monuments to after the body dies. Like, this is just silly ignorance. None of those things are necessary. Even the breath is not necessary. When we die, we're just going to be the same old, I would assume, peaceful selves. How could we not be ourself? Because there is just this, you know. But when we have a fixation on a body and identity, then there becomes something to lose, then there becomes something to maintain. But when we go beyond that, we go beyond birth and death in a way, both figuratively and literally. Because if I'm not the body, then who is it that's dying? Who is it that gets sick? Who is it that does anything? It reminds me of the Advaita Vedanta and I love reading about that stuff. I love reading about Nisargadatta Maharaj. I don't know if you're familiar with him. One of my other teachers actually studied with him in India, which is cool. Are you familiar with Nisargadatta at all?

**Speaker B:** I feel like I've heard that name, but not incredibly familiar.

**Speaker A:** No, he's just an Indian saint who like ran a little what do they call those things? Biddis, or yeah, those Indian cigarettes. He had a little Indian cigarette shop, but in the evening he would have basically Dharma talks. He was a cool dude, highly recommend him. Nisargadatta Maharaj. And hello, uh, hello, BV.

**Speaker C:** Hello, how are you? I'm very well.

**Speaker A:** Namaskar. And what's your name, dude? I can't see it on there. Bhante.

**Speaker C:** Bhante.

**Speaker A:** Cool man. How are you doing? Oh, hey buddy, I know you. Hey. How's it going, dude?

**Speaker C:** Hey, DJ.

**Speaker D:** Hey Bhante, am I saying it right, Bhante?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, you're saying it right.

**Speaker A:** I wish we can all have one global name. You know, let's all call each other brother. So much better. Either way is fine, I guess. You want to keep your names, keep them.

**Speaker C:** Is Dhammarato coming to this meeting?

**Speaker A:** I don't believe so. Would be nice. But he's already so busy on Saturdays and Fridays and Sundays. Gotta give the guy a rest once in a while. Yeah, but that would be lovely though, definitely. So is there anything you guys want to talk about? Me and DJ just been kind of chatting about the Dharma.

**Speaker D:** That's great, nothing, no, nothing particular.

**Speaker A:** That's good. When there's nothing particular to chat about, that means that there's usually not that many problems or disturbances in our minds, so that's pretty sweet. But have you guys ever read any Ajahn Samatha or listened to any of his talks?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, Ajahn Sumedho is, you know, like an Arahant. He's a very great master. So yeah, that's, you know, that's an underrated practice for American or Western people who are concerned with the path. You know, there's all these Arhats out there, or Srotapanna, or what have you. That are giving Dharma talks and, you know, people just don't listen to those. And they're really missing out on like constant development in their lives and, you know, being informed by wisdom. So I hope more people will start to do that. But a lot of people just don't understand that that exists, you know, and that that's out there.

**Speaker A:** That's kind of why I mentioned it, because I like to put these wonderful teachers who I could only learn from sometimes in books or YouTube videos. But there's a lot of people, there's such a wealth of wisdom, and sometimes we miss out. And it's a great practice just to listen to their wholesome Dhamma talks. For Ajahn Samadhi, if anybody has Spotify, he has a whole library of podcasts, of Dhamma talks, and they are wonderful and they last long. You know, they'll go from an hour, hour and a half, you know, 2 hours sometimes. So it's a real great blessing to be amongst such wonderful teachers because there's a lot of people who aren't aware of them, and there's a lot of people who may go their whole lives without even hearing about such things. So in that way, we're all blessed to have even heard about the Dharma and the Eightfold Noble Path and the Four Noble Truths of Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, dissatisfaction and ending dissatisfaction, our ability to change dissatisfaction into satisfaction. It's really quite a superpower to be able to change dissatisfaction into satisfaction. And in other videos, I've called it like the holy alchemy of turning lead into gold. And it really is far more valuable than if you could turn lead into gold, because we've all seen people who won the lottery or gotten rich suddenly, and then before you know it, they have family members coming out of the woodwork wanting to rip them off of their money and manipulate them and lie to them. You have people suing them for certain things, so they get a little— everybody wants a little piece of that money. But, and they quickly learn, man, I thought this was supposed to solve everything. And Sometimes it adds more problems, more things to look out for. Reminds me of a story of— there is like, I think it was a Zen monk or somebody had a teacup that somebody gave. I don't know. I don't know if Ajahn Chah told this story or not, but anyways, this beautiful story. He just was talking about a monk who got a teacup and somebody gave it to him as a gift. But when he had the teacup, he didn't have any other possessions. He only had this brand new, very beautiful teacup that his friend gave him. And the whole time he had it, he was washing it and it was very fragile. So he had to, you know, put it in his bag and make sure his arm was always around it in case he bumped into a tree or a branch or something or fell. But after a couple of weeks, he gave the teacup away to somebody and he was just like, oh, so glad to get rid of that rock, that burden. And after he said that, he thought it was funny how this little beautiful teacup at first seemed like such a lovely gift ended up to be such a burden. You know, he almost— you get to a certain point where you almost want it to break so you can be free of trying to protect it. Like, I was perfectly fine before this teacup. Now I have— but sometimes dissatisfaction comes in nice little beautiful packages, you know. And if we're not aware of them, we require— sometimes we will acquire one teacup and then another one and then this and then a jacket and then a car and then a house. And before you know it, you're living a whole life of trying to protect things that are causing you great dissatisfaction when there's no need for it whatsoever, really. I used to watch Zen videos on YouTube, particularly this one called Amongst White Clouds. Have any of you ever seen that documentary?

**Speaker B:** No, I haven't seen that one. Amongst White Clouds?

**Speaker A:** It's called Amongst White Clouds. Oh, you're close to seeing it?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I watched it, like just the COVID like, oh nice, no.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that happens sometimes. Sometimes the covers are more interesting than the actual. But in this case, it was a wonderful documentary. And as I'm watching it, you see these Zen hermits that live in these mountains in China. And they're just kind of carrying on these traditions of hermits who are wearing robes that have been cast off by other monks. They're like building their little huts out of stone. And I would watch this documentary over and over for 15 years. I think that's how long it's been around. And I would find myself asking myself, like, what's fascinating me about this? And what always fascinated me about it was that the ability people have to live in complete isolation in the forest and be completely content. And when I told myself, that's why you're watching this over and over, because when you see a man living alone in the woods who is completely satisfied, it's not even so much about the environment, but just to see anybody who can be completely satisfied with so little is just very inspiring and a very inspiring piece of Dhamma artwork. Great movie, highly recommend it, Amongst White Clouds. So you don't really need too much in this life to be satisfied. Ajahn Chah used to say, if I wake up and I have my bowl of rice, if I have water, then what else could I possibly need? Nothing else need be here.

**Speaker C:** You've got to sacrifice to experience that, you know, otherwise you won't know about it. So find ways to sacrifice, and then you, you know, you experience that for yourself, that, oh, all these things that I think are giving me freedom or pleasure, all these things that I think I need, they are not like actually giving you freedom or real pleasure, just like you know, something like masturbating or eating food, it's not really sustaining for the long term. Well, it's not wrong or right. It just has an effect, you know.

**Speaker D:** I'm just joking.

**Speaker C:** And you may miss out on so much, you know, so much of the real joys of life because you don't sacrifice much. And then what you do is just kind of live in a maze of desires, you know, and then the corresponding fears. So if you sacrifice, then you also give up the maze, and you give up the desires, you give up the fears. And when you're not in a maze, and you're not controlled by desire and fear, then you can have so many interesting experiences concerned with the Dhamma and Buddhism and different places in the world or meditation centers, etc. Because there's like a line that people draw where, yeah, I'm interested in this stuff, but ultimately, you know, I'm going to be a businessman. And the point of the Dharma is that that's not going to work. So, you know, while you're still young and you still have that openness, you know, not too much filial responsibility, you sacrifice and you go outside of your bounds. And then, of course, if you want to come back to it, as a young kind of Western-influenced, intelligent person who knows about the Dharma, you can go away for 5 years and come back and you'll be the same age as you were now, because you won't be so stressed. And then you can do it. So I take the approach like sacrifice as much as you can, as soon as you can, and have experiences concerned with the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha, and then, you know, what you want to do moving forward, you will have more power to do that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, sacrifice. If I was going to sacrifice anything, if I had a choice, it would be sacrificing the idea of an I, me, my mind. To give up wanting things to be different than they are, to give up wanting something that I don't have. That's the sacrifice I want to give, is this craving. I can sacrifice this ego craving to the fire, and that's the only sacrifice I need to do, because anything else is just going to cause me more dissatisfaction.

**Speaker C:** The issue in that is that it's easy to trick ourselves and kind of justify what we're doing. So when you renounce materially or when you renounce the things that you think are unnecessary to renounce or, you know, kind of are useful then you see very clearly the Dhamma of what you have and what you are used to is not permanent and reliable. So when you give that up, then you experience the subtlety of the grasping, the desire. But if you stay in this kind of box that you've created for yourself, and then you think about this highest peace or this highest renunciation, It just, it becomes a way of perpetuating, you know, what you're already involved with and the level that you're already at. And Buddhism is really about getting to a higher level so that you can help more people, so that you can, you know, be more peaceful, be more free from suffering.

**Speaker A:** Who needs to get to a higher level? I don't need to. I'm satisfied right here on the ground. Right here where I am. And if we're satisfied, in my opinion, that's one of the best ways we can help others. Because when we're satisfied, more people will naturally be drawn toward you. More people will kind of naturally want to hear what you have to say, if you have anything to say at all. But getting too wrapped up in the over-intellectualization of it, getting too wrapped up in rites and rituals and beliefs and being and becoming and I, me, mine, it's just more mountain climbing, race running, you know. And I think I don't need to be the best I don't need to be the best Dharma practitioner. I don't need to be the best helper of friends. I don't need to be anything. You know?

**Speaker C:** And to embody that state is to be a Srotapanna or to be an Arahant, etc. But to think about that or like appropriate that understanding, you know, to fixate on that idea as a justification for perpetuating our craving and our desire is more normal than becoming a Srotapanna or becoming enlightened, which is what those teachings are pointing to.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and who needs to be an Arahant or a Srotapanna or enlightened? It's not necessary. Not necessary at all. We don't have to be, we don't have to become anything different than what we already are. We don't need to be anywhere than right here, right now.

**Speaker C:** Sure, and I mean, we can say also that it's not necessary to die, but you know, see how that works out for you.

**Speaker A:** So who is it that will die?

**Speaker C:** Well, it's not someone, it's not someone who's already. So that's having faith in the Dhamma. Right, that there isn't someone who could become anything anyway, right? That's not what Buddhism or becoming a Srotapanna is about. It's not about someone becoming something because that's impossible.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, whether we become something or don't become something or die or don't die, it doesn't really matter. The only thing that matters is being satisfied here and now. Nothing else is of any real importance. But if other people want to chase things and chase ideas and notions and things in their mind, they're more than free to.

**Speaker C:** Well, they're not free because they do that.

**Speaker A:** Right, but they're free to go chase that stuff. In that sense, they're free. Not going to have much satisfaction, but yeah, that's okay. We don't have to be the saviors of mankind.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, because the Buddha already is. In a certain sense.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, in a sense. Yeah, he is a nice man that lived a while ago, and his friends wrote down some very beautiful things.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I remember We were once talking with Dhammarato on a call, and he came up with this question, this crazy question, like, is it relevant if the Buddha existed? Like, would it change anything right now, like, if the Buddha was real or not? So in the end, it's like, yeah, well, I have the Dharma. I only have Dhammarato and the Sangha to thank for— well, Dhammarato for introducing me to it, and my Sangha friends, my Sangha brothers and sisters, for keeping me wide awake and focusing on the breath. And that's like, well, that's the only thing that really matters to me right now, you know? Like, the Buddha might be real or might not be, might not be real. Like, he could be just, uh, like, you know, 5 monks like, okay, we need people to, to practice this shit. It's, it's awesome, man. How are we gonna do it? Okay, let's invent a superhuman being.

**Speaker B:** And.

**Speaker D:** Let'S try to solve that, he would say. But in the end, it's, yeah, it's right now that matters.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Siddhartha was a dude And— There.

**Speaker B:** Are thousands of fighters on my boat. Whoa!

**Speaker A:** Thousands of fighters on my boat. Yes, I'm very thankful that the Buddha existed, because he showed us the correct ways to practice. But like I've said in other videos too, We have Buddha Dasubhikkhu, we have Dhammarato, and like Dhammarato has told us, or what I listened to recently, it's like these teachers, they're nice guides, and he was saying like, but they all at the end of the day still kind of stand on, on clay feet. We have to be adults and kind of take the reins over from just regurgitating, just doing what other people are doing, and find out for ourselves the best way to be satisfied here and now. And when we're listening to these wonderful teachers that have come before us, we're grateful and we recognize their wisdom. But ultimately, it's just words until we look in our hearts and see for ourselves that we don't have to chase these illusions, these cognitive illusions any longer. We can come back to the breath. Come back to reality, come back to here and now, and the ideas of Srotapannas and people who are enlightened and not enlightened, or religious people that do it correctly or don't do it correctly, or black and white, up and down, all these things fade away and they're meaningless. Well, I think we have to be.

**Speaker C:** Quite careful about that because You know, we're so delusional, actually. And we have so many wrong views and subtle, you know, grasping and craving. I mean, are you suffering or are you enlightened? Are you at peace or are you, you know, is your life a mess? Is there a lot of difficulty and errors and things that you'd like to change, right? So subtly in the mind and in our experience, we have our own kind of religion. And so the reason we don't have a faith in Buddhism is because we have so much faith in our own grasping and craving religion inside of ourselves. So Buddhism gives us a system in which to be free from that. So developing faith in the Buddhist teaching and then applying them is how we, you know, kind of don't allow our subtle, complicated, you know, kind of nightmare of our mind to control us and to run our life. Because, yeah, we can talk about things, we can think about things, we can intellectually understand the Dhamma. But it's a very different thing between experiencing the truth or practicing the Dhamma and having an intellectual understanding of it. And the more that you strive to meditate or to practice seriously or be around well-known meditation masters, etc. That's how you kind of test, you know, you see what is my mind. Because it's easy to say I'm at peace while you're in the bathtub, you know, smoking weed or whatever people do. But it's much more difficult to know about your mind in a situation like that, to actually know about your mind. So I, you know, I take refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. I don't take refuge in my understanding about things, because I'm not a Buddha, because I'm not enlightened. That doesn't mean that I'm not practicing to be at peace, or to be content, or it certainly doesn't mean I'm chasing after, you know, like ideals of enlightenment, but it means I recognize how faulty my own understanding is. And so I don't take refuge in that. I take refuge in the Sangha. You know, I take refuge in Srotapanna. I take refuge in Arahants, you know, and that part of the Buddhist teaching is very important because it gives us a standard in which to detach from ourselves. You know, and detach from like people say, hey, I'm wealthy, or hey, I can make poetry, or hey, I can talk about things in, you know, a really interesting way. But do they actually know the truth experientially and do they embody that? And so those labels, those notions are just pointing to the experiential embodiment of the Dhamma.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, gladdening the mind here and now, like the Buddha taught, Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Dissatisfaction and the end of dissatisfaction. That's basically all he taught, or the most important thing he taught. So if you're satisfied, everything else is just conceptual white noise, just conceptual. Like on the TV, they'd show that white noise, that snow, that kind of— everything else is that outside of being satisfied, because Anything else outside of that is just more constructing of wanting to get somewhere where you're not, wanting to be something you're not, become something you're not. But if you're satisfied, it's not very complex. It's kind of simple. Anybody can do it. Anybody can gladden their mind here now. You don't have to take your life so personally. You don't have to take things so seriously. You know, that's why it's fun to say things like, who cares about Buddhism? Who cares about the Dharma? Who cares about any of this stuff? You know, we're just having fun. We're just relaxing. And we learn in these ways of speaking, these wholesome, nurturing ways of speaking, that we come back to reality outside of these concepts that we're holding on to so dearly. We come back to, oh yeah, I can make jokes about the Dharma, I can make jokes about Buddhism, I'm not attached to any of this stuff, I have a lightness about me. And that's where, if there was a true nature, that to me, that's where that would be, in satisfaction and gladdening the mind here and now, coming back to reality, the physical reality of the breath, outside of these conceptual notions that are always going to be part of the body, and that's okay. And we rinse and repeat.

**Speaker C:** Well, congratulations. There's satisfaction. There's satisfaction of Dukkha, Nirodha, and then there's satisfaction of eating cheeseburgers or, you know, taking opiates or things like that. And oftentimes the satisfaction that people talk about in a worldly way is just about pleasantness. It's not about the cessation of suffering. So it's something to watch out for because a lot of people are pleasuring themselves and, you know, feel relaxed after eating a cheeseburger. But I'm not sure that's what the Buddha was talking about.

**Speaker A:** I love cheeseburgers. Well, that's probably where we differ because I would say that's exactly what he's talking about. Not so much going after sense pleasures, But getting to a place of satisfaction where you're not obsessing over rules, you're not obsessing over right and wrong ways to do things. You have an idea, you have a guide, you know, and there's also the idea of the middle way. You know, it's not wrong to enjoy eating a cheeseburger, but you might want to also enjoy drinking water once in a while. You might also want to enjoy a day where you're not eating, you know. But there's nothing wrong with the enjoyment of eating something. There's something wrong in the attachment to it. There's something wrong if you're dissatisfied with not having it. Then there would need to be a change that needs to be made.

**Speaker D:** On the yesterday call, was it yesterday, DJ, or was it the day before? We were talking about this, like the meal and what the Dhammapada says, be indulgent with the food. So I asked DJ and he really enlightened me with that and it was like, Yeah, well, it's not about the sensual pleasure of eating what I'm chasing, but actually knowing that eating nurtures my body and it brings it to a nice place. Like, yeah, it's not the same to eat the cheeseburger 5 times a day than to eat it once, you know.

**Speaker B:** Like— Yeah, it's— yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker D:** One leads my body to to a healthy place. It allows me to practice more efficiently, to say so.

**Speaker C:** It's a good idea, but the Buddha teaches us to develop revulsion and disgust for the body. So this is once again more of like a worldly approach to the Dhamma. The body is unsatisfactory. The body is on fire with greed, hatred, and delusion, with distress, with anxiety. We have to be kind of ready to experience the suffering of the body and the unsatisfactoriness of the body before we can know what the Buddha taught about.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I mean, if you're in a state where you feel as though you still need answers and are still questioning things or feel that you're satisfied or feel that you're dissatisfied, You know, all I can say is the only thing that exists is right now. And can we be satisfied right now or can't we? And if we're in a state where we're saying, well, I can't be satisfied, I need to make more sacrifices and I have to feel guilty about what I did yesterday or this sense pleasure that I do, that's just more Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But if we can— yeah, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** I know if one is like, okay, I want to have, you know, this cheeseburger right now, I want to have this sense pleasure, you know, and various different things, you know, it's— that's to be recognized and thrown out, that the pleasure that is born from sense pleasure is crude. It is not, you know, actually worthwhile really, right? So I think there is— yeah, definitely, if one is you know, consuming food, right? It is to remember that, hey, this is just for sustaining the practice, right? Again, the Buddha is about the middle way, right? So again, we eat the food to sustain the practice, but again, indulging in the flavor, being like, oh my gosh, this is so wonderful, it's actually— yeah, in one way it's better to rather gain the joy from the actual fact that this pleasure is not worthwhile. You know, we needed it just for sustaining the practice, right? So I do find that to help definitely with the consistency of being able to come back, you know, throughout the day to wake up here and now and be like, I can be happy without these things, right? So it is helpful to, I think, guard the senses in that regard, you know. So I think there's definitely something that is, you know, respectable about that. But again, we can do that also moment to moment. Like right now, we can become aware of that, right? Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but there's also kind of a sky daddy sense of help me, Father, tell me what I should and shouldn't eat, tell me how I should and shouldn't behave. Let me give up my autonomy to something that please At some point, those are good guidelines, but at some point we must grow up and think for ourselves.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, no, but this is directly also discerning. Again, it's like, yeah, we have the confidence, right? Or we develop that with the teachings of the Buddha, right? With the Four Noble Truths, with, hey, the Buddha did go out there. The Buddha did do the hard work. Like, he went out there, he practiced extreme asceticism, and he was also on the opposite side in his early life, right, with extreme sense pleasure, like, especially for the time, being a prince, right? And so he goes out, he does the hard work, and he has the middle way, right? And so he shares it with us. You know, he goes through that and he's like, okay, this is how to practice, right? And so we take that upon faith, right? And then that becomes confidence as we continue to practice. So, again, it's not saying if you're eating something and you're feeling shame and guilt and all this stuff because you're eating something, no. Also, if you're like, "Oh, well, I'm eating—" Somebody gives you something, somebody offers you some food and you're like, "Well, this isn't the exact health food that I want for my body because my body needs to be beautiful," and you're not going into the gratitude aspect of it, right? That can also be a thing. So we can have a lot of things when it comes to food like that. But to recognize that the food is just to sustain the body, it's about though not coming from a rule, but from coming from the wisdom that this actually is more fulfilling, right? That the sense pleasures are not fulfilling. I mean, this is a pretty— like, they're just not, right? And so as we continue to practice throughout our lives to see And that's something where like, yeah, somebody like Bhante, right, is a monk and goes off, is really embodying that in terms of actually practicing that. And so if somebody is a householder, right, again, I think it is wise to be on guard. Again, not from a place of constant fear or what have you, but to keep looking, keep discerning, keep changing, right? And then coming back to, I can be happy without these things, right?

**Speaker A:** So it seems like, it seems like a lot of work though, no?

**Speaker C:** Sutta here from the Buddha. There are, Mendicants, these two kinds of happiness. What two? The happiness of lay people and the happiness of renunciates. These are the two kinds of happiness. The better of these two kinds of happiness is the happiness of renunciants. There are arguments against these two kinds of happiness. What two? Sensual happiness and the happiness of renunciation. These are the two kinds of happiness. The better of the two kinds of happiness is the happiness of renunciation. And then it goes on: the happiness of attachments, the happiness of no attachments, defiled happiness and undefiled happiness, and happiness of the flesh and happiness not of the flesh, and noble happiness and ignoble happiness, physical happiness and mental happiness, happiness with rapture and happiness free of rapture, happiness with pleasure and happiness with equanimity, etc. So I think the question becomes, you know, what is renunciation? And how do we practice renunciation actively, you know, towards all the phenomena and involvements that are in our lives? You know, and I speak as a Buddhist, you know, I'm following the teachings of the Buddha. I'm not, I don't really see it as a sky daddy, but more like the true teacher that I follow, you know, as a Buddhist monk and as a as someone who identifies as a Buddhist. And, you know, when I look at the suttas, it seems that this is, you know, the guidance for ending suffering. So that's why I follow it. You know, that's been my experience with it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Well, that's a good— that's very good that you do that. And I would never tell anybody to not do things that is bringing them satisfaction. Because I don't happen to particularly practice that style or that way. So if you enjoy calling yourself a Buddhist and if you enjoy worshipping, so to speak, Lord Buddha, I think that's wonderful and there's nothing wrong with that whatsoever. But for myself, I should have a little tattoo on my forehead or sign around my neck when I start any type of video calls. It's, I'm not the best Dharma practitioner, I'm not the best scholar, I'm not an enlightened person, I'm not— I don't need to be anything. And in that way, I feel very satisfied. And that's kind of my practice. Is that I don't need to be a good Dharma teacher. I don't need to be a good this or a good that. If I'm satisfied, naturally, I don't need anything. So I don't even need to win arguments or debates. So if anybody has their own personal beliefs that bring them satisfaction, I think that's wonderful. And I would definitely tell people to continue doing what they feel in their heart.

**Speaker C:** Well, I don't think that any kind of beliefs bring satisfaction. You know, I think the Buddha teaches us not to rely on beliefs and frankly not to rely on ideas about our experience. But it seems to me that there's a very strong habit energy to conceive about things. That I see or hear or experience mentally or physically. So the training that the Buddha teaches is to not conceive about things. And that's kind of a very intensive and active process, you know, to not conceive. I don't think anyone needs to do anything. But the Buddha found out that you do need to die. And you do need to, you know, deal with sickness and old age as well. And that that's a kind of natural situation that you're in as a human being. And so I don't think the Buddha became enlightened because he needed to, but because he recognized what his body and mind were subject to, and that him being subject to conditions was unsatisfactory. And that the Buddha would not stop until he was satisfied or until he was free, you know, so which led to the Buddha's enlightenment.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, if whatever floats your boat.

**Speaker C:** Well, as long as we can make it to the other shore, we can, we can put down the boat. But if we don't think that there's, you know, another shore, or that we are on the path, then we probably shouldn't call ourselves a Buddhist or represent ourselves as being involved with Buddhism. That may be confusing for people. If someone doesn't believe in the Dhamma, but represents themselves as being a Buddhist teacher or someone who knows about it, That may be more like a Zen thing, I suppose. But, you know, Zen is not really a thriving tradition anymore. And Dhammarato seems to be more involved with early Buddhist texts, the Theravada Sangha, helping people to ordain and get in touch with meditation centers and You know, Dhammarato seems to be very informed by the early Buddhist scriptures and all that kind of stuff.

**Speaker A:** Well, all I know is that I don't know nothing.

**Speaker C:** Only don't know, straight ahead.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and yeah, Dhammarato is very knowledgeable.

**Speaker B:** About.

**Speaker A:** About Buddhist history, different vocabulary words in the Pali Canon. But one of the best things he ever taught me was, don't rely too much on being a scholar or reading certain types of books, but rather he would tell me, the best book to read is between my two ears. You know, so that's what I do and that's what I try to follow.

**Speaker D:** First call I had with Dhammarato, I remember I was like, okay, so I've read the Dhammapada, I've read also Tibetan Buddhism, I've been reading Did Nathan, and I'm starting to read the Pali Canon in Buddhist words. And we're like, wow, okay, wait, can you leave all that apart? Like, oh, okay, yeah, sure. And he just started talking to me and introducing me to these, what I'd say is a more— well, not more, but to the actual practice of somewhere I can take, because Like, I'm not saying that the Pali Canon is not necessary, but well, what I really need to do is to experience it like the Buddha did, like the Buddha experienced the renounce. He started experiencing these things. So what I really, well, in a certain way needed to do was to experience this, and Dhammarato helped me actually guide my mind to this place where I can go like, oh yeah, I can, I can really, um, in a certain way, like in my own ignorance I'm talking, I'm talking, Bhante, but, um, to renounce to all of these things that bring me Dukkha and, and actually experience you can Nirodha and be like, yeah, I can be happy right here, right now. All my life I've been I thought, no, man, I need to go to a monastery and into the mountains and actually experience that life so I can actually feel relieved of this, of Dukkha. And well, Dhammarato just taught me that, well, the practice actually goes inside of my mind. I get my mind is going to be as crazy as it is in the middle of the city or in the the middle of the woods. So yeah, just experiencing right here, right now, for now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's easy to get caught up in the rat race of the mind and the Western, the typical Western mindset of we have to, you know, we have to be like Rambo, we have to climb the mountains, run the race, and only then after we We do these things, we work really hard, then we get the cheese and we get the golden carrot. Instead of looking at ourselves, we should be looking at ourselves as we're enlightened already. We can be satisfied here and now. It's within us. It's all around us. Like Jesus said, the kingdom of heaven is here. But people can't let that go. Yeah, they have to be taught, no, there's differences between this person and this person. This person works hard, therefore he gets the reward. This person doesn't, therefore he fails and starves. It's like, no, it's a game. It's an easy, fun dance. It's not meant to be work. It's easy peasy and it's fun for.

**Speaker C:** A lot of people. For a lot of people, it's not easy. For a lot of people, it's really horrible, and it's certainly not fun. And really, the main principle is cause and effect, and that it does work like that. If you eat poison, you will be poisoned. If you eat the Dhamma, then you will become more free. You don't need to eat poison, and you don't need to eat the Dhamma, but cause and effect are very real. You know, and it's kind of a strange idea that most people don't believe in cause and effect, but it's quite true. And if we kind of are flippant about cause and effect, it's likely that we will spiral into lower realms and have to be there for a long time. Because cause and effect is happening moment by moment in the most simple and general way. You know, you eat, you drink soda, you get diabetes, you drink water and.

**Speaker A:** You— Where's cause and effect in this moment? Where's the hell realms and the heaven realms? Where are all these things? They're in the mind. When we come back to the breath, we're coming back to now, coming back to reality where everything's okay. There's no need to be right. There's no need to be wrong. There's no need to get somewhere other than where we are. If we can't find peace, satisfaction right where we are, where are we going to find it after we work harder, after we sacrifice more? It's just putting the carrot further away when it's right here. We can be happy here and now. We don't need to be so strict and serious with ourselves. We could take a breath and relax.

**Speaker C:** Well, I think there's a lot of different cases and a lot of different contexts, you know. So for someone who's going through serious mental or emotional or otherwise issues, you know, telling them that they can just relax, it doesn't really mean anything. And I think I think it's important.

**Speaker A:** To understand that I've had some people tell me that it saved their lives after telling them to relax.

**Speaker C:** So, well, yes, sometimes it can be—.

**Speaker A:** Maybe it may not work.

**Speaker C:** Sometimes it can be very helpful.

**Speaker A:** But if the intention is good in anything we do, it can't be all that bad.

**Speaker C:** Well, I think that, you know, we have to watch out for this notion of convincing about things. And that the Buddha wasn't trying to convince us of anything.

**Speaker A:** There's no need to convince anybody of anything. If somebody's on fire and they say, hey, I'm on fire, I'm gonna say, oh, there's the water. It's their choice whether or not they're gonna jump in the pond or not.

**Speaker C:** Well, mostly we're convincing ourselves of things. You know, the biggest person that you're convincing of things is yourself. So that's the thing you have to watch out for, right, is not convincing yourself about anything and just experiencing, you know, without conceiving.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but I think that's a little bit over-intellectualizing it. I think it can be explained and there's no need to convince anybody of anything aside from If you want to practice the Noble Eightfold Path, I would suggest— just a suggestion, I'm not saying anybody has to do this or don't— if you hear of the Noble Eightfold Path and you practice it and you're earnest, chances are you're going to get good results. Convincing— I'm not in the business of convincing anybody of anything. People are free to do whatever they wish. But if they're on a Dharma call, if they're interested in what we call a Sangha, then yeah, we're going to definitely talk Buddhism, we're going to talk Dharma, we're going to talk truth, we're going to talk different styles, we're going to talk about all kinds of things. So it's nobody forcing anybody to do anything, it's just things that are naturally arising.

**Speaker D:** I think this cause and effect, well, my experience has been quite polarized when I'm When I started talking to Dhammarato, obviously, because, well, in the West, the Kamma is quite an almost like a bank, like an imaginary bank of actions. And yeah, well, I've been mean with this person, and then in 10 years now I'm going to be scared because my conception of this Kamma will make someone else make the same thing to me that I did 10 years ago. So, um, coming to peace with this conception of karma— well, karma could be, um, like my condition, but my condition is right here, right now. Like, well, yeah, I have everything right now, um, because I've already— or I am actively renouncing to it. I am actively renouncing essential pleasures, to all of these external factors, which then can come like this cause and effect. Bhante Koh, like, to me, the intention becomes the cause thing. Like, yeah, my cause is, well, I have an intention to it, like, yeah, to eat healthy, to it right now. Yeah, I'm gonna eat this fruit so my body can— so this body can be healthy, can age well, and can be right for the things I do right now. Like, I do sports, etc., etc. And so it helps me to.

**Speaker B:** Eat well.

**Speaker D:** So that's the the kind of like the cause I have right now and the cause will bring an effect that's actually, well, positive to my own well-being.

**Speaker C:** You just need to watch out for the imaginary because the karmic bank, right, the bank of cause and effect that we, you know, we can call our body or mind or our conditionality, it's I mean, it's imaginary in the same way that the money in your bank account is imaginary. And look how important that is to you, right? So we kind of have to know how to work in both worlds to stay practical, you know, like continuously practical. Otherwise, you know, it's justifications, it's convincing, it's conceiving specifically. And the Buddha teaches us to train ourselves in such a way where we aren't conceiving about sights or sounds or thoughts or experiences that we have, but just the seeing itself. Right? In the heard, there's only the heard. In the breathing, there is only the breathing. In the experience, there is only the experience. In that idea, there is only that idea. It's not something more.

**Speaker D:** Yeah. It's Natan who said that when I eat, I eat. When I sleep, I sleep.

**Speaker A:** That's quite like— when I shit, I shit. Yeah, I'm drinking water after Taco Bell, I shit.

**Speaker C:** People are constipated. That means they're full of it. So, you know, we have to take the Dhamma so that Dhamma is like a laxative and it clears out all the, you know, all the debris. Yes.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, but people need to be willing to take it, right? Like, the cool thing about the Dhamma is that it's not Well, I think I've experienced two different types of this when I share with people. When I say the word Buddha, they are not— they don't seem to be experiencing aversion towards my words, but they instantly kind of like, yeah, sort of aversion to it. They push back a little, a little, a little more. And when I just talk about my own experience, like, yeah, this is how, like, well, I've done this, I've done this, and this happened, then this, and blah blah blah blah blah blah, like, in, in that way, um, like, um, not in a— I don't know what the word is, but in a less dogmatic way, you know, less, yeah, the sutra and the Buddha said, and more like, yeah, so this thing happened to me and like I was constipated and I did a laxant and it made me shit like crazy, man. I felt awesome. And so that's kind of like the.

**Speaker B:** Way I— Good job, dude.

**Speaker D:** I like to speak to spread the Dhamma and, well, to actually practice it with my mouth and mind all together. Well, I think that's something I like to do.

**Speaker A:** That's good, Ben. In any moment, we can choose A million reasons to be dissatisfied, or a million reasons to be satisfied. The choice is ours. Give up beliefs, give up being and becoming, give up liking and disliking, and just gently resting in the way things are. Well, does anybody else have anything to say? Because I think I'm going to close it up because I got to go get my kids.

**Speaker B:** But.

**Speaker A:** Any last thoughts, feelings, questions? And thank you all for joining. Yeah, thank you. As always, thank you, DJ. Thank you, everyone.

**Speaker C:** Enjoy being with your children.

**Speaker A:** Oh yes, it'll be wonderful.

**Speaker D:** Hopefully.

**Speaker A:** All right, bye.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, Bhante.


### Summary

Here is a summary of the Dhamma talk between Dhammarato's Sangha friends:

The conversation is an informal, meandering dialogue among practitioners, touching on several core themes of Buddhist practice, with a strong emphasis on **direct personal experience over doctrine**.

**Core Themes:**

1.  **Finding Peace in Contentment:** The central thread is the discovery that happiness comes from letting go of craving and being content with the present moment. Speaker A describes a powerful "Piti experience" where, through practicing the Noble Eightfold Path, a heavy mental burden lifted, leading to the direct insight: *"I can be peaceful without needing this thing that I don't have."* This is celebrated as the heart of the Dhamma—the ability to end dissatisfaction (*dukkha nirodha*) by changing the mind's attitude.

2.  **Relating Wisely to Difficult Emotions:** The group discusses how to handle negative states like sadness, fear, or anger. The approach is not one of suppression or aversion, but of mindful allowance and investigation. Speaker B shares an example of allowing sadness to be present, seeing its impersonal and conditioned nature, and not letting it define the day. The attitude is to greet difficult mental states like "old friends" without identifying with them.

3.  **Critique of Worldly Values & The "Middle Way":** There is a shared critique of societal conditioning that equates happiness with acquisition, achievement, and control. They contrast this with the Dhamma's path of contentment. The "Middle Way" is discussed not as a strict rulebook, but as a natural, balanced responsiveness to life—taking care of necessities (like repairing a hut or eating) without fixation or excess.

4.  **The Primacy of Direct Practice Over Concepts:** A significant tension arises between two approaches:
    *   **Speaker A & D** emphasize **immediate satisfaction through letting go**. They advocate for a simple, non-dogmatic practice: gladdening the mind here and now, using the breath to return to reality, and not getting lost in concepts like stages of enlightenment, strict rules, or philosophical debates. Speaker A even playfully questions the necessity of the historical Buddha, focusing instead on the present-moment utility of the teachings.
    *   **Speaker C (Bhante, a monk)** emphasizes the importance of **guidance, structure, and renunciation** as taught in the suttas. He warns against self-deception, stressing that true renunciation and understanding cause-and-effect (*kamma*) are necessary to uproot deep-seated craving. He advocates for taking refuge in the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha as a standard beyond one's own often-deluded understanding.

5.  **Simplicity and Gratitude:** The talk begins and ends with appreciation for simple, accessible sources of peace—like walking in nature or cemeteries—and deep gratitude for having encountered the Dhamma and supportive spiritual friends (*kalyāṇamittatā*).

**Key Takeaways from the Dialogue:**

*   The ultimate goal is **satisfaction and peace in the present moment**.
*   This is achieved through **mindful awareness** of the mind's habits and the **application of the Eightfold Path** (especially Right Effort and Right Mindfulness) to abandon unwholesome states.
*   Practice is a balance between **cultivating wholesome joy** and **investigating negative states with wisdom** until they lose their power.
*   While the talk reveals different stylistic emphases (immediate experience vs. traditional guidance), all participants agree on the core principle: suffering ends when craving ceases, and that this is a practical, verifiable truth to be realized personally.

**In essence, the talk is a snapshot of practitioners encouraging each other to trust their experience, prioritize contentment over complication, and continually return to the peace available right now, beyond concepts and stories.**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by the speakers:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Spider Web / Tangled in Society:** Speaker A describes society as wrapping your head around and getting you "tangled in its spider web of always needing something you don’t have." This illustrates how societal conditioning creates persistent craving and dissatisfaction.

2.  **Riding the Wave vs. Being Crashed:** Speaker A contrasts healthy and unhealthy ways of dealing with difficult emotions: "It's riding the wave of sadness as opposed to letting the wave of sadness crash you into the corals." This frames emotional experience as a natural force to be skillfully navigated, not a destructive event.

3.  **Old Friends:** Referencing their teacher Dhammarato, Speaker A personifies difficult mental states: "these are your friends... Hello, old friend... It's good to see you again." This metaphor encourages a non-adversarial, accepting relationship with passing thoughts and emotions.

4.  **Kingdom of Heaven is Here:** Speaker A uses this Christian-adjacent phrase to point to the immediacy of satisfaction and peace: "the kingdom of heaven is there, but we don't see... because of bad habits." It's a metaphor for the ever-present potential for contentment that is obscured by our conditioning.

5.  **Holy Alchemy / Superpower:** Speaker A describes the core practice as "the holy alchemy of turning lead into gold" and "a superpower to be able to change dissatisfaction into satisfaction." This elevates the practical application of the Dhamma to a transformative, almost magical skill.

6.  **Maze of Desires and Fears:** Speaker C warns that without sacrifice, one can "live in a maze of desires... and then the corresponding fears." This metaphor portrays a life driven by craving as a confusing, entrapping labyrinth.

7.  **Dhamma as a Laxative:** In a humorous, earthy metaphor, Speaker C says, "the Dhamma is like a laxative and it clears out all the... debris." This frames the teaching as something that purges accumulated mental clutter and suffering.

8.  **Clay Feet:** Speaker A, discussing teachers, says "they all at the end of the day still kind of stand on clay feet." This metaphor (evoking the biblical "feet of clay") suggests that even revered guides are ultimately human and fallible, emphasizing the need for personal responsibility.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **Dolly Parton in Cemeteries:** Speaker A opens with an anecdote about hearing Dolly Parton say she likes cemeteries because they are peaceful, well-kept places full of history and nature. This story introduces the theme of finding untapped peace in unexpected, simple places.

2.  **The Monk's Teacup:** Speaker A recounts a story (attributed possibly to Ajahn Chah) about a monk who received a beautiful, fragile teacup. Initially a treasured gift, it became a burden as he constantly worried about protecting it. After giving it away, he felt relieved, realizing "this little beautiful teacup... ended up to be such a burden." This story illustrates how possessions and attachments, even pleasant ones, can create **dukkha** (suffering).

3.  **Amongst White Clouds Documentary:** Speaker A describes being inspired for years by a documentary about Zen hermits in China. The story he focuses on is the "ability people have to live in complete isolation in the forest and be completely content." This serves as an inspiring example of profound satisfaction with very little.

4.  **Personal Anecdote of Frustration:** Speaker D shares a story from his first call with Dhammarato. He listed all the Buddhist texts he'd read, and Dhammarato told him to "leave all that apart" and focus on direct experience. This personal story highlights the talk's recurring theme of moving beyond intellectual knowledge to direct, practical understanding.

5.  **The Buddha's "Market Research":** Speaker D humorously speculates that the Buddha might not have been a single historical figure but perhaps a creation: "5 monks like, okay, we need people to practice this shit... Let's invent a superhuman being." While not a traditional story, this playful anecdote underscores the group's focus on the present-moment utility of the teachings over historical dogma.

**Overall Theme:** The metaphors and stories consistently work to make abstract Dhamma concepts (craving, contentment, non-attachment) tangible and relatable. They contrast the burdens of worldly pursuit with the lightness of peace found in simplicity, acceptance, and present-moment awareness.
