### Transcript


**Speaker A:** That's life, isn't it?

**Speaker B:** That is life.

**Speaker A:** Such is life. Good, good, bad, bunch of positive stuff, bunch of bullshit. And cry as we might, change it as we may want to, it just is what it is. That's kind of like the essence of the Dharma practice for me, is like I think when I was younger, I used to think that I could change things, I could change my mind. And I'm not saying you can't. In a sense, yes, that's exactly the practice, is to make the positive change. In a weird way, it's not changing the mind. It's just changing our attitude, our relationship toward mind, attention toward the mind, like you said.

**Speaker B:** Yes, Simone Weil in a Samanarī Jayasara video with Simone Weil, a Christian mystic. Simone said that sin is— she suggested that her concept of sin was looking in the wrong direction. So that might be suggestive then, is something about our attention or ability to form a perspective in amidst change. Is the way I was understanding you.

**Speaker A:** That's interesting, you talk about Christian mystics. I was thinking today of, uh, of Rasputin. Rasputin. And, um, I was reading a biography on him a while back. I haven't finished it, I still have it though. I got to jump back in it. But as big of a piece of shit as that dude was, like nobody can deny, he did some pretty crazy good and miraculous things. Not always, of course, but I feel like that guy's teaching was kind of like what me and you were talking about today, Brett. Like, he's a big pile of shit mixed with a whole bunch of goodness, like the Buddha nature, but all of that combined is like the yin-yang of existence, so to speak. It's neither grasping nor clinging nor diverting yourself away from either, but just observing the way things are, you know?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And being like, you know, and I'm not saying this like literally, obviously there's good and stuff, but I'm like, I've been telling myself sometimes like, you know, life is shit, life is fucked up, it's chaotic, but that's okay. Everything's fucked up and chaotic, but once we become okay with that, is it still fucked up and chaotic? No, it's like that Dukkha changes into Sukkha. You'll never change the base variable. It's impossible. You can only change our attention and attitude toward it and relationship, so to speak, with it.

**Speaker B:** Yep, that's why the First Noble Truth is primary. There is suffering. The second Noble Truth is what you've skillfully enumerated, that when we stop struggling, acceptance is available here and now.

**Speaker A:** Yes, absolutely.

**Speaker C:** I had a real-life experience of that a few days ago with work. I work I work for a global company, IT company, and a lot of the people I work with are in India. And the time difference, you know, the time difference is kind of a bit— it's 5.5 hours or something behind us they are. And we have a meeting at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, my time. And I've decided, and for no real reason, but I've decided, right, that's it, when this meeting's over, I'm finishing work for the day. There's no And of course we get on the meeting and one of the guys brings up, oh Luke, you know, can you help me with— and oh, the Dukkha, man. And I was even a little bit short with him. Like, I'm usually pretty cool and calm. I was a bit like, oh, you know. And I stayed back and I helped him say for another— it took about an hour, say. So I finished at 5 o'clock and I left the office and walked to the train. And then I was like, what was that all about? Why did I even— like, I've got no plans tonight. I didn't have to finish work at 4 o'clock. It was just that I just got this stuck in my head that that's what I was going to do. And, um, actually the next day I ended up sending him a message and saying, hey man, sorry if I was rude. And he said, that's fine, you know, no problem.

**Speaker A:** That's good.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I thought it was the right thing to do, you know, to apologize, because my perception of it was that I was rude to him. I don't know if how strongly that came across, but yeah, it was just— I was able to— when I left the office, you know, I let it go and I was like It's just control, you know. I struggle a bit with wanting to control situations, you know, and wanting to control rather than just being able to just go, oh yeah, that's cool, I'll just hang, you know, I'll just finish whenever and help this guy. And, you know, I'm doing a good thing, I'm helping someone. But no, I was stuck in that, I've got to finish, I've got to do this, I've got to do that. Yeah, it's just, it's interesting. I was reflecting on it kind of later saying You know, but I was able to let it go, whereas probably in the past, you know, years ago, I would have kind of stewed on that for a while. And yeah, you know, I've been like, oh, this guy, you know, he kept me back at work and I didn't want to be there. Yeah, anyway.

**Speaker A:** Especially as men, we kind of— nature has given us these triggers of anger, more so than women. There is differences between men and women. I mean, only a moron would think that there's not differences. There's a lot of things that are similar as well, obviously, but I know that's a hot debate now all over the world or whatever. But the truth is, men just have a tendency to rage out, and it's like our primordial nature, you know? It's in our blood. And but I think with Dharma practice, we can subjugate that, we can conquer.

**Speaker B:** That.

**Speaker A:** But not completely. You know, like Dhammarato says, try as we might, the Dukkha will still arrive. But if we have a good relationship with the Dukkha, if we just see it as, oh, it's just a phenomenon that arises and falls away, does it still become Dukkha? I don't know. It changes, it transforms. It's only pure Dukkha, so to speak, if you still are like, "Oh, there's more Dukkha! What the fuck? Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!" You know what I mean? But Dharma practice takes a person like you, I would say, and instead of completely raging out when you felt that way against that guy, you're a little irritated. You maybe even said something, you know? But then also with your Dharma practice, you go back and you apologize and you see the faults of your ways or whatever. And that's perfect in my— and I know we shouldn't say I mean my, but it's just a guideline— but in my opinion, I think that's Buddha. I don't think Buddha is a guy who never makes mistakes. I don't think he was a person who just wasn't a human. I think he was a concrete human, and I think he lashed out. Even Jesus in the Bible lashed out, but they did so in ways that were just ordinary lashing out. You know what I mean? Didn't cross that line into, um, real Dukkha territory, you know.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's an interesting way to look.

**Speaker D:** At it, isn't it?

**Speaker C:** And you're seeing the different traditions, the different ways they see the Buddha, you know. Some seem kind of like this perfect god, godlike being who— but yeah, sometimes when you do read the suttas, and it can be a little bit.

**Speaker D:** Um.

**Speaker C:** I'm not sure the word, but sometimes you kind of read it like, oh, you know, he was this great person who could read everybody's mind and know everything. But then you read another sutta where you think, oh, he seems a little bit like not sure in this situation, or a bit, you know, it's sort of, yeah, it's difficult to fathom sometimes.

**Speaker A:** Not to mention, we're not even sure if what we're reading is actually from, yeah, even from a source we can trust. I mean, that's true. That's 3,000 years old, something.

**Speaker D:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Um, maybe there, you know, if you take a guy who's so prolific in his, um, and his ways of seeing the world and, and views on things and expressing them to different people, and he chooses not to write much stuff down, to me that speaks more about his intentions and nature than anything that the students will have to say. You know what I mean? Because you have to be a pretty special person to be that wise and choose not to write anything down, or at least write so little that not many people can even find any original text. You know, they find the original text from the students, no problem.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I've never thought about that before. Interesting.

**Speaker B:** Well, a lot of spiritual traditions all the way from the Gitas and whatnot were passed down primarily word of mouth, was my understanding, but I'm not a historian. But I think just even if it was serendipity that allowed for the Buddha to transmit the methods of the Dharma that way, I still totally agree. I think it was fortuitous for us here now because you could test it, come and see. Yeah, you can, we can test it, or go ahead.

**Speaker A:** Oh no, I was just saying you could keep going. I just threw that in there.

**Speaker B:** I have nowhere to go.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but yeah, we could test it, you know, and that's kind of, uh, when you look at his teachings, and that's what Buddhadasa Bhikkhu was great at, was taking the whole chunks because You know, I'll never learn more.

**Speaker C:** I'll—.

**Speaker A:** Buddha Dasabhikkhu has forgotten more about the Pali Canon than I'll ever learn, or I'll ever remember.

**Speaker D:** Me too. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And if somebody like him, uh, very trusty, amazing, wise person, can read the whole thing and just kind of like, like, oh yeah, it's just like Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, man, you know You know, follow the Noble Eightfold Path. Everything's Anicca, Dukkha, and Arhat, not worth clinging to. Everything arises and passes. And just chill out, you know, chill out with everything. That's so wonderful. And I would recommend, there's a book, I probably showed it a while ago, but I have it right here, but it's called The Truth of Nature from Buddhadasa Bhikkhu. And it's a great book and I recommend it because it's a lot of the questions from students and it's just, it's not like these crazy questions that are hard, it's like questions we all really are thinking, you know what I mean? And they throw it all at Buddhadasa and it's all organized beautifully and he goes into length with his answers and replies to what they're saying and it's a great source. Whenever I've heard any Buddhist teachers say anything that I'm doubtful of or skeptical, I always revert back to that source. Like, okay, I'll just look up a death. Okay, Dhamma. Okay, this, that. And like, what do you think about this? And he'll just go through it. And I have almost the whole book highlighted. It's so beautiful. There's almost no point in highlighting it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's the experience that has occurred here when reading his Anapanasati. I was so impressed that he spent over 300 pages on the first tetrad.

**Speaker A:** Whoa.

**Speaker B:** In that book. Now I've shared that with a few Dhamma friends, and one of the first comments I get is, oh, is that his book for serious practitioners? And maybe that was the subtitle of the book, I don't recall. Um, I knew the book was called— go ahead.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there's a book called Mindfulness with Breathing, uh, and, uh, I thought it said for serious, but I think Dhammarato said that was like a kind of a translation issue or something. But go ahead, what are you saying?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I don't think this is it. It's simply just called Anapanasati, and I downloaded it from the OSF Google Drive, if I recall.

**Speaker A:** I mentioned that it was for serious practitioners.

**Speaker B:** I don't think that's the— I'm not sure, I have to look again, which it's on this phone, but I'll just stay in this window. Uh, and but yeah, it's— I don't think I'll ever have another question about mindfulness with breathing moment by moment on an object again.

**Speaker A:** That's awesome, man. Yeah, because it's not really about questions or answers anyways. I remember somebody was quoting you, Brett, when you were saying like Anapanasati is enough. I thought that was, that was amazing, you know. It really like drives home the point of, um, what we're doing, what we're all doing, you know.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker C:** Mind will go up.

**Speaker A:** Go ahead, buddy.

**Speaker B:** No, go ahead.

**Speaker A:** I was just saying the mind will go up.

**Speaker B:** The only skill is staying present.

**Speaker D:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the only skill is staying present. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was saying something. We'll go Luke and then Ivan, if that's okay.

**Speaker C:** I was just saying it's a great skill to develop, right? Staying present. If you can stay present, then there's the answer.

**Speaker A:** Yes, totally. Arhat, what were you saying, dude?

**Speaker D:** No, I was just saying, uh, Tanhisara Bhikkhu, which I'm sure Brad is familiar with, uh, he said, uh, the present moment is not the goal but it's the path towards the goal, which I suppose is talking about Dukkha, Nirodha, or, you know, any of the very— Sorry?

**Speaker B:** We can simplify that though. It sounds like a paradox, and I think that might seem confounding at first encounter. But if he's saying the present moment is not the goal, Upon listening to hundreds of talks by Ajahn Thanhasaro, what I find is that the present is mentioned quite a bit. So then, if there's a goal, and talking about goals can be sticky because of Tanha, our craving minds, so then what we're training for is, if we want to simplify, we're training for remembering sacred awareness, which is already here now. So the goal is no effort in remembering that, simply languishing in the joy that we're feeling right now. And if we no longer have to remember because we've built the skill of being here now, that's the goal. The goal can happen in one sit, or it can just be appreciated right now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, we're always trying to fix things, you know. Well, at least that's how society kind of has raised us. It's like more, more, more. Fix it, fix it, fix it, even if it's not broken. Yeah, reminds me of YouTube back in the day. Not a lot of people probably recall this, but When YouTube— after the first 3 or 4 years when YouTube really got going, they were great, man. We would do live calls, we would have 10, 15 people, and we would have side private chats, and then we would have normal chats for people to see. And everybody had video, and the algorithm worked so smoothly, it was incredible. They had great art you can make on each profile, was very dynamic, and had different sets and subsets of different ways to change all kinds of things. It was miraculous. And then from then on, it's just like, it's like they wanted to fix it. They wanted to fix something that wasn't broken, and they've created just— yeah, some things naturally have gotten a little better.

**Speaker C:** But.

**Speaker A:** Um, in a way they almost break it intentionally so that they can have an excuse to just do something other than sitting and breathing.

**Speaker D:** Totally.

**Speaker B:** Totally. I think it's— I think they broke it for me, you know. Now I'm older, and if I'm not extremely mindful, set in my ways. And yeah, I used to post science stuff, hobby stuff on a YouTube site, I think starting in 2012 or something like that, really, really soon after YouTube got going. And it just seems like, yeah, it got overly corporate friendly, and it became less personal after those changes that you mentioned.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, they keep trying to find the, like, the golden carrot with their algorithms, and it's like they fail to recognize, like, everybody goes towards a different platform that has more freedom and has more artistic control. And then they're like, oh, we got to be like them, we got to be like this app. And then everybody steals it, everybody monetizes it, And everybody sucks the soul out of it. And they were wondering like, hey, why aren't we as popular as we used to be? Then another little app company comes up, gives you a whole bunch of freedom. Everybody flocks there. And the cycle continues.

**Speaker B:** That's it.

**Speaker A:** Just like society. Oh, there's a leader. He's the best. He's the worst. Anarchy. Oh, there's this guy. He's great. He's the best. There's another guy who's better.

**Speaker B:** Anarchy.

**Speaker A:** This up and down, up.

**Speaker D:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** Whether it's real families or just, uh, republics or whatever, it's all the same shit. It's a different deck.

**Speaker B:** I think we even have— I think we even are ought to be, if we can be, wise and mindful that that doesn't occur in our Sanghas as well, and that we always reiterate, there's another thing I appreciate about, I believe, Dhammarato's paper about teaching, and that we don't pedestalize, that we stay on the level of Sangha, of friendship, and turning that authoritarian teaching model on its end and just doing away with it.

**Speaker A:** That's great. Sounds good.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, you see it in organized sort of— I spend a fair bit of time in a monastery that has both Bhikkhus and Bhikkhunis. And coming from Australian society where, yeah, let's be honest, it's not completely equal between the sexes, but it's, you know, we get— we're pretty good. And I remember once going there was Bhikkhunis and Bhikkhus, and I came in to offer something, and I offered it to the Bhikkhuni first. And she said to me afterwards, oh no, don't do that, you've got to offer to the Bhikkhus. I'm like, why? Why can't I offer to you? Oh no, no, it's not done. It's not the done thing. I was like, yeah, I don't know. Like, there's still that— it's the Thai forest tradition, so there's still that sort of— even though they're Western monks and nuns, basically It's still that sort of, oh, you've got it. And you see, the monks just get treated like this, and the Bhikkhunis get treated like this. And I'm just like, I don't know, I don't get it. But yeah, I don't get it at all. Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Period.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there's like, there's people who are really into those traditions and cultures, and that's fine, you know, whatever. But for earnest practitioners, I think there's some— I think there's people who become abbots and monks and they miss the mark. I believe they're still playing the societal game. But then, yeah, once in a while you get a Buddha Dasa Bhikkhu Ajahn Samadhi, and many more who play the game. They dress up in the robes, they enjoy doing those things, they do some rituals, they do some things like this, but they're not attached to them, and they have a delicate balance between them. And that's like a correct way. But I always— hi, buddy. Oh, hi, Arlene.

**Speaker E:** Hello.

**Speaker D:** Hello. Arahant.

**Speaker A:** But then, you know, I always liked the Zen masters who just would— who could— they could stay in the tradition, some did, but most of their life they spent in isolation. They spent as recluses. They gave candy to children. They said Zen Master Ikku would be found by a river playing hide and seek with children. You know, they always come running to him because he'd give them candy and all this stuff. Same with Zen Master Ryukin. And Ikku, more than Ryukin, really scoffed kind of at the whole institution of Zen. He thought it was becoming nothing more than a money-making scheme during funerals, you know. They pay the monks to go do their rites and rituals, and that's how the monks, that's how the Zen monasteries and whatever, that's how they stayed. That's how they were able to survive in a sense. But these guys looked at that. Ironically, at the end of his life, I think Zen Master Bhikkhu became— he was just old and sick and they're like, "Hey, want to be this abbot at one of your former places?" He's like, "Fine, they'll feed me and give me this," even though he spent a lifetime condemning that stuff. But that kind of, to his credit, that's kind of showing his non-attachment to even his what people would assume strong views about that stuff.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, that's cool.

**Speaker A:** And Ryokan would just spend his days in a leaky hut, you know, writing poetry by candlelight and calligraphy. And somebody entered his hut one time and he was just spinning a bowl on a stick, and he was— they said he was laughing and giggling like a child. And I was just like, Yeah, I don't know, something resonates with me when I hear these stories. It's almost like truth doesn't need a language, it doesn't need— it doesn't even need science, it doesn't even need to be tested in a way. It's like you feel it, it's there. And sure, it's easy to lie to yourself and to deceive yourself, but if there's this earnest loving-kindness and compassion, it's almost impossible to deceive yourself or others. Because you're not trying to get anything. You're just listening to the story, feeling the energy that you're feeling, you know? And when I read those old Zen masters— yeah, there's no, there's no questions in my mind of, oh, was it like that? It's like you could tell from the way they live their life. Like Jesus said, don't listen to what people are saying. You can tell what they are by the fruits that they bear, you know? And I think that's so beautiful. And thank God for that, because otherwise we wouldn't know what the fuck, what practices to do or whatever.

**Speaker B:** Well, the practices within the body, one fathom in length, and the mind that knows it, and vice versa. So what other people are doing isn't much relevant to one's own practice. That's something else. I don't know, a joke I came up with is it's insight, not outside. It's often difficult to see motivations of others from the exterior, man. We fall into judgment.

**Speaker A:** It's like the whole finger in the moon thing, you know?

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Um, it's a useful thing, but it's the yin-yang. You can't concentrate solely on the finger, you can't concentrate solely on— at the beginning, the finger's there, and it's kind of a dance, you know? You forget sometimes, you go back to the finger. Oh yeah, it's pointing at the beautiful moon.

**Speaker D:** That's it.

**Speaker B:** I like that.

**Speaker A:** And that's how life is. We get swept away in it. It's easy to practice Dharma when you're— everything's going smoothly. Yeah, of course. You know, practice Dharma when shit's hitting the fan, like, like Buddha does. Practice Dhamma when you're sick, and if it is benefiting you, aka alleviating your Dukkha, turning it into Sukkha, you're on the right path, you know? You don't need anybody to tell you. If you could go through all that shit and be like, you know, going through all that shit, still kind of kept my head about me, so to speak.

**Speaker C:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** I would— I'm sorry, Luke, go ahead, Luke.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I was just going to say, I was, um, on that call, I think it was Sunday, we had a call and Dhammarato was there and he's been unwell. I think he still is unwell. I've tried calling him maybe yesterday or the day before.

**Speaker A:** It gets better soon.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, sounds pretty nasty. Um, I said to him, oh, you know, 'Oh, you've been unwell?' He said, 'Yeah.' I said, 'Oh, sorry to hear that.' He said, 'Ah, it's a chance to rest.' Like, yeah, it's a good way to look at it. Get to rest.

**Speaker A:** Very good. You know, it's an expected— right, what's that, buddy?

**Speaker C:** I was just saying, he sees the positive in it, right? See the— yeah, the lining of, 'Hey, I get to relax now that I'm not feeling well. I don't have to get up and do this and talk to these people and do that and this and that. I can just rest.

**Speaker B:** And painful sensations, if we're under the— if we're under— if we're experiencing an illness, if we're in the— on a hospital stay, or heaven forbid we're in a mental institution for a while, that's a retreat. That's seclusion in a way. It's not seclusion from painful sensations, but that's Dukkha Nupassana.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely.

**Speaker B:** Be aware moment by moment. It brings us into the present, and it's the lamp of the First Noble Truth that lights the rest of the way. So the operating system that we're building, and when we read, as we practice, as we return to the present, as we remember to enjoy what's here now, is one of wisdom. And the First Noble Truth leads us to the Second Noble Truth, which illuminates exactly what we're doing to struggle. And I think that was the theme of Bhikkhuni starting this topic. I think Dhamma eliminated the very subtle sense of struggle where there can be a painful sensation, but then when we're not okay with those painful sensations, that's a multiplier. And that equals Dukkha. So that's even something that comes to mind that actually I don't know what he's been up to over the last few years, but I remember 8 or 9 years ago I was on the internet watching a Shinzen Young talk, and Shinzen had a simple math equation. And yeah, I know this may not be popular, but it's just a little math equation. Pain times struggle equals suffering. Meaning, so the cause of suffering then is a multiplier for the sensation that's already there and natural. Not being okay with it, the not liking. And that's again, that comes to Dhammarato. I've heard him say in so many videos, so many times, so many group chats that practitioners have asked, or they've complained, or they've engaged in the beginning of a pity party, and he just shunts that back to the truth. So he says, you know, it's the not liking, it's not the sensation itself that's the problem, it's the not liking inherent in that.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes. And we all kind of— that's a cool thing about reality. Whether you have the Buddha or not, it's like we all kind of inherently know this from the time we're born. Like, shit's not— like, when we're born, it's like shit's not quite right. Shit's kind of chaotic. Shit's kind of scary. It's kind of this. It's kind of— sometimes it's heaven, sometimes it's hell. And we spend the rest of our life trying to— like, Ajahn Chah said, change the duck into a chicken, into a chicken into a duck. And we bang our head against the wall trying to do this. It's like We practice the Dharma for a little bit, we go, oh, that's just the way shit is. I don't know why, it just is, and it's great. Like, fuck it, you don't have to make it perfect. Nobody's happy with their body, nobody's happy with their money, nobody's happy with their careers, nobody's happy with this, nobody's happy with that. Big fucking deal, that's great. And when you can accept that, you become happy with all of it. Because it's like, it's the way it's supposed to be, finally.

**Speaker C:** Well said, man.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there's no distinctions between us. We all are, we all are Buddhas. We're all enlightened right now, you know.

**Speaker B:** It's already so. We're just catching up with it sometimes, like it's already in progress.

**Speaker A:** It's only our mind that maybe after the call will go, ah yeah, but I still got to pay this bill, but I still feel inadequate, but I still got these frustrations. Good, fuck it, that's life, bring it on.

**Speaker B:** That's practice.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, everything's fucked. Cool, I'm down. What else? We just live and breathe and eat and shit. What else is gonna happen? We might go to jail, we might get killed, we might— this is it, fuck it. Whatever happens, happens.

**Speaker B:** Then we're gonna die.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, then we die. Who knows what after that? I always inherently imagined it'd be something pretty trippy and cool. That's not popular in Theravada things, but, uh, uh, it is fun to think about, you know. I like thinking about that stuff once.

**Speaker B:** Well, you're free to talk about it here.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, it's just sometimes it can get confusing because a lot of the mundane ways of doing things kind of muddy the water with that stuff. It's not whether it happens, it's not whether it doesn't happen. These metaphysics, they're fun to think about, of course. Philosophy, it's fun to philosophize about stuff, of course. But the Dharma practice is we don't know, and that's okay. You can think and have a belief, it's okay. Just don't become so attached to your belief that it causes Dukkha. You believe all kinds of shit, it's okay. But the point of the Dharma practice is seeing the reality away from these illusions. These illusory things that may bring us heaven one day, may bring us good karma if we light a certain incense a certain way, you know, may help us develop into a spiritual enlightened being if we do things correctly. These are all superstitions, not worthy of our attention. The only thing worthy of our attention is our breath. Is being here and now, where everything's okay, everything's fine.

**Speaker D:** I was just reminded of a very Zen story, just two monks talking. I think they were trying to discuss what is Tathagata, which is here and now, right? Like, I'm not sure what they are trying to discuss. And then at some point, it's like they get frustrated. At least one of the monks got frustrated because it's like, it's like a loop. And then the other monk was like, all right, come have a cup of tea. Then basically the story just ended. Like, I think it's very ironic because it's like the moment is like, okay, here, have a cup of tea. It's basically just here and now.

**Speaker C:** Like.

**Speaker D:** That is no need for those intellectual discussion, which is— I find it very funny, like the story just ends right there. Like, here, have a cup of tea, and it just ends there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the Buddha said, with the sip of tea, I end the war, the war of the mind. You know, yeah, I always have this vision of like this, this like 20-year-old woman in a parking lot whose like life is falling apart. And her friend's life is falling apart, but they're just like eating a Subway sandwich. They're like, man, it's so good. Yeah, totally. And for a second, they move away from their problems of the mind and come towards the moment. And it's like, you can always— that's always available, you know. Only the mind makes it seem not easy, but it is easy. But in a weird way, the mind kind of does everything in its power to get us away from that. Because of bad habits, you know, bad ways of society teaching us certain things. You know, when I go to my— when I go to family barbecues and stuff like this, I was like, so what you been up to? What you been up to? What are you doing? It's like, why can't I just exist? It's like, oh, you have no ambition, you have no drive. It's like, no, I have a lot of it. But it's about, you know, going toward freedom from suffering, from Dukkha. It's not always easy to see because I'm not like running marathons and shit or like climbing some corporate ladder, but, um, what the fuck's the point of that if you can't enjoy it? All the actors and actresses, that's right, yeah, most of them are on drugs. Most of them, you know, by themselves sometimes.

**Speaker B:** They're not happy either, no matter how many drugs or whatever outlets of Moha Lobha Dosa, you know, competition, delusion, gaining. It doesn't do it.

**Speaker A:** It's just ignorance of trying to be comfortably numb. But the best way to be comfortably numb is to follow the Noble Eightfold Path. Remember that everything's okay here and now.

**Speaker B:** There'll still be good feelings that'll come and go through that space. So I wouldn't even say necessarily it's numbness. I mean, maybe to us, but again, the mundane view of numbness might contain with it some foreboding superstition, but it's not that way. It's free. And clear. Beautiful.

**Speaker A:** Generally speaking, numbness. Not too literally speaking, but yeah, same.

**Speaker C:** Dukkha, dukkha, nirodha. Yeah, cool relief.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, addiction. If you want an addiction, that's what Buddha Dasa Bhikkhu said. If you want to— if your ego mind, monkey mind wants something to cling to so desperately, some identity then give it the living Dharma to cling to.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely.

**Speaker A:** And he even recommended on like kind of a mundane— not in the Buddhist sense, but in a regular sense mundane kind of way— of keeping notebooks, studying the Dharma, watching YouTube videos, talking about the Dharma, making art about the Dharma. Become addicted, you become addicted to that. Want to be something, be that. You are that.

**Speaker B:** Excellent. That thou art.

**Speaker C:** Speaking of Buddha Dasa, am I— so I've only just started kind of reading about Buddha Dasa. So with, with the whole rebirth thing, right? He talked about it more sort of being reborn in each moment as opposed to that sort of physically being going to another body. Yes, after death and stuff. Yeah, okay, I'm sure that, that would have caused a bit of a stir at the time, no doubt, in Thailand when he kind of came up with that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, he was, uh, very controversial for a certain period of time, so I hear. Both with his choice to eat meat, his, what I would say, correct view on what the Buddha was teaching, more correct, not complete like, oh, we're better or worse, but just, it just comes down to like, it's almost like a math problem, you know? It's like people are concerned with what you call the number 2 and what is the number 2's essence. And Bhikkhu Dhammarato is just like, 2 2 2 4, dude. You know, I'm not concerned with what you call it. I'm not— it's like, this is what he taught. We can test it, and boom, you got it. And because the Hindus, they did that for years, you know, with rebirth and all this stuff, and the Brahmins. And, um, it's not that it's— it's not something to either— like, it's nothing to recoil from. It's just not what the Buddha taught. The Buddha was teaching Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. People believing in heavens and hells and superstitions and all these things, they're still trying to get to a place where they're not. And the Buddha's teaching was, you are here now. You could either live it in misery chasing these magical fairy tales that don't exist, or you can just relax and chill and have a calm here and now. Then once your mind's calm and you're practicing the Dharma, there's nothing wrong with reading books like we were talking about earlier, studying what happens after you die, metaphysics. It's fun shit. Just don't get it confused with the path, you know what I mean? It's like, do the earnest practice, then play the games, you know? It's like learning to walk before you could run.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, but it's so funny to see the spectrum of Buddhist traditions that have come about, like Pure Land Buddhism. I had a bit to do with that over the years. And that's basically all about the next life, you know, you're chanting, you're doing this and that so that you get this rebirth. And that completely goes away from the present moment, right? It's almost like, well, I mean, in a sense, you're still staying present to chant or to focus on. But it's just, just that spectrum. When people ask me about, like, who aren't Buddhists here, ask me about, oh, you know, something about Buddhism, I'm like, oh man, like, there's this whole spectrum of traditions. It's not just like all Buddhists do this or all Buddhists believe this, or it's like a whole spectrum.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, go ahead, Brett. Well, I just— rituals that are performed with a future grasping occurring so that there's a craving concomitant with or associated with them, yeah, that's not in my view a practice that leads to freedom in the here and now. So, and it's also reifying the second fetter of being, which is the notion that if we perform some kind of rites and rituals that the Buddha taught were inherently empty, that that's going to lead to some future result, and that's going to invariably lead to Dukkha. Yeah, that's going to be painful.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and the practice itself, it's not bad. It's not like, no, don't practice Pure Land Buddhism. You want to practice Pure Land Buddhism, go ahead. But I think it would be nice to get the basic understanding of what we're talking about before you do that. So you can see it for what it is. It's like, because whether we're talking about Pure Land Buddhism or something else, we all practice to a degree rites in these superstitious rituals that we can get attached to, aka money. Money is paper, but we put pretty pictures on it, we give it this value, and based off of how many people are giving it a certain type of imaginary value, it becomes what we call valuable. And it's just fucking paper, stinky paper. It's an illusion. Delusion. You can use it to buy some groceries, you know what I mean? It has its place. It's not the money that's bad, it's the negative attachment to the money that— Sukkha— that makes it something that we should be careful. Um, just like Pure Land Buddhism. You want to practice Pure Land? Go ahead, it's fun. But careful because you might get in this Dukkha realm unintentionally. Yeah, but you practice the real foundation of the Buddha, yeah, then go dance.

**Speaker C:** Around whatever.

**Speaker B:** You want. Yeah, yeah, here in the practice, here attending ceremonies at Watts, which I've attended several, where the laity are happy, they're in a good mood, and rituals are being performed there. And at the same time though, the way I look at that, and especially when I'm visiting another tradition of which I'm not privy to a lot of their history and the background, I'm respectful. But to me, in the practice here, I view it as gladdening the mind, and it does. It's Dhamma Sukkha, it's Sangha Sukkha, it's joy that results from being with others who are enjoying the presence of the monks and they appreciate the value of those keeping Dhamma, Vinaya in the community, and it's a small community, the wat that's closest to me, and so I appreciate that experience, but I do not get caught up into the belief that engaging, smelling the incense or whatever's going on is going to be the means to free me from my pity party or anything. But of course, no insult to any other traditions on our beautiful tree.

**Speaker A:** Of course. And, you know, putting on our clothes is a tradition, is a superstition. Why do we— like, Dhammarato, why do we need clothes? I mean, except if it's cold, maybe there's more logical reason, but most of the time it's like You could walk around naked, but we put these rites and rituals and laws into effect so those things don't happen. And we get these habits. But it's no different than what Brett was saying from going to a monastery or watching or participating in different traditions. You might think, no, I practice the real Dharma. This is— now I'm doing superstitions. No, dude, you were doing superstitions when you opened your eyes, when they started telling you that's choose. That's a tree. This is your name. When you start calling yourself by a name, that's where you started. Oh, true. Yep. So yeah, participate in life. Do all these things if you choose. Whatever you wish, do. But careful not to let it cause Dukkha if you get too hung up on it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** That'S it. Yeah. That's why Zen's cool too, and it's just another name of the same fucking thing. Same rose, different name, whatever the fuck. But you know, there's Christian Zen, atheist Zen, traditional Buddhist Zen, you know, Zen practitioners and Dharma practitioners and Theravadans. It's all just mumbo jumbo names. But like Dhammarato always says, the essence is the same. If you practice, like Ramakrishna used to say from the Hindu traditions, if you practice in earnest, you know, all paths lead to the same place. Yes, whatever. The Dhamma practice is slightly different because in my, in my learning of the Dhamma practice, it's, it's like there's all these trails into the forest, but, but the Dhamma practice taught by Dhammarato and Buddhadasa Bhikkhu and the Buddha are the clearest to me. It's so clear. It's like, yeah, but I could go around there and climb a mountain. But like, why? And if you enjoy mountains, go ahead, but there's the path that's clear. Let's go here, path of least resistance. So that's why I think there can be a little confusion when somebody's like, hey, what about this? What about that? It's like, guys, yeah, you can go do all those things, but why waste your time? You know? Realize, have the wisdom that there's a clear path there. Then if you choose, yeah, go all over these paths, explore, have fun. Oh, hey buddy!

**Speaker B:** Hi Alexander!

**Speaker F:** Hey man!

**Speaker A:** Hey everybody!

**Speaker F:** Sorry for the late show up, but I wanted to come in and show my face and give a wave and stuff.

**Speaker C:** Yeah dude.

**Speaker D:** No problem.

**Speaker A:** Nice to see you all as well. Since we, since we kind of all been talking, was there anything on your mind, Alexander? Anything, uh, you've been thinking about or anything, or no? I just want to give you a chance to have a little bit of a say because we've all been jibber-jabbering already.

**Speaker C:** Thank you.

**Speaker F:** Um, one thing that's been on the mind lately has been, um with regards to practice, like practicing Right Speech has been something that I've been applying and sustaining my mind on quite often, you know, and I'm learning a lot about it just from watching our Sangha interact in all of this. But I would love to hear anything anyone has to say on the topic. I think it would be really helpful.

**Speaker C:** For me. Actually, if you don't mind, I'll jump in. I noticed, and this is directly to what you're saying, Alex, there, remember, you may recall that conversation you had with someone, the guy from Venezuela. I don't know, hopefully it's alright for me, I won't mention names or anything. But he's really suffering, this guy, and your interaction with him was beautiful, man. You just were like, peaceful. Whereas the day before, and I was guilty of it too, had been interacting with him and kind of been resisting what he was saying and trying to change what he was saying. And trying to, and he was just getting more and more worked up. And in the end, he kind of left. But then at the end of the conversation you had with him, he said, thank you, I feel much better for today. I feel like I've been heard. He just wanted to be heard. And we weren't hearing him. We were resisting, fighting him. And, you know, so yeah, that was really beautiful, man. Nice.

**Speaker B:** I enjoyed that.

**Speaker A:** Oh, excellent.

**Speaker F:** Thank you. I think one of the things that I've been really pondering on and finding a lot of value in is that, and I've heard it from a few other practitioners within our Sangha, I really appreciate them letting me in on it, I guess you could say, is that it seems like with Right Speech, a lot of the times it can be very skillful to not speak speak. And I have been really working on that myself because I can be quite.

**Speaker A:** The chatterbox. Me too. Yes, can't we all? Yeah, it's a delicate balance, you know. But like Luke was saying, you know, sometimes people— there's men who go through life, men and women of course, but since we're kind of all dudes here, you know, this— a lot of men go through life, nobody listens to a goddamn word they say. Even though it's not too much traditional Dharma practice, just having a Dharma practice with a group of friends, man, that's just— that could just change somebody's life just to be heard once in a while without somebody bitching at them and making them do shit they don't want to do. A boss, a wife, an abbot, this or that, you know. Sometimes they just want to talk for fucking 3 minutes, you know? Just listen to me, you know? That's what Dhammarato is great at. He's emphasizing the friendship, you know? And no matter if it's me hosting a call or Dhammarato or this guy or this guy, it's like, it should— in my bad at saying this because I'm always like, there's no opinions, but Fuck it, I always have opinions. In my opinion, it's a wonderful thing to have a place where friends can get together and just chill for, you know, an hour here.

**Speaker D:** And there.

**Speaker A:** Thank you, Dhamma. Thank you, guys. Yeah, thank you so much. Thank you, Alexander. We're probably going to get going pretty soon, coming up on an hour. Does anybody else have anything they want to throw out there before we go? The floor is open.

**Speaker E:** I just want to say thank you for everyone. The Dharma is just so lovely. I don't know what to say. Like, some of you might already know, but I started university like about 2-3 weeks ago, and it feels like I'm on a rocket ship because I just get everything done early, easily, and effortlessly. And then people notice. Like, I started staying behind in the department, and then like I study group just naturally formed around me, and I'm like, they're like asking me, like relating back to the right speech stuff, they ask me questions like, how are you so chill? How are you so relaxed? I'm like, it's the Dhamma. If you're interested, I can, you know, discuss, but if, you know, you're not going to be receptive to it, then there's no point, you know. It's not, it's not going to be worth even.

**Speaker B:** Our times.

**Speaker E:** Um, and yeah, I find myself always returning to the breath evening watching Sangha calls, and, uh, I'm just.

**Speaker D:** So grateful. I love that.

**Speaker A:** Thank you so much for sharing that. I appreciate hearing that.

**Speaker E:** I do too.

**Speaker B:** Thank you so much, Arulian.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, maybe, um, I'm thinking next, uh, in January— so in January is when you can create like a new society in the university. I'm thinking if there's interest Perhaps a Reading University Sangha or a Dharma Society. That's an idea.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, it's a wonderful idea. Yeah, of the Dhamma friends.

**Speaker B:** That's wonderful. When we drop the burden of dukkha, we have.

**Speaker D:** More energy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, actually, it was always— it was already there. But we were wasting it in struggle. Yeah, the second truth.

**Speaker E:** So true. And like, it's so ironic because the people on my course have obviously chosen to be here, and yet they're just choosing to suffer as well. And I'm like, I'm just going to enjoy every moment, every lecture, every minute. And it just works. I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Like, yeah, that's what life's all about, dude.

**Speaker B:** Dhamma practice, joy, friendship. The closing thing, last thing I wanted to share, Alexander, was the consequences of speaking when I would have been better off.

**Speaker C:** Being silent.

**Speaker B:** And probably number one is Dukkha. On reflection, but number— that's probably number 2. Number 1 is the possibility that with careless speech, there have been times where I have cut my own practice— cut the practice here off from receiving Dhamma from others. And yeah, we practice a Dhamma that is ultimately no maintenance. Yet noble friendship, it's the whole of the.

**Speaker A:** Holy life. Yes, reminds me of Jesus, like, you have to, you know, forgive. In order to forgive others, you know, you got to forgive yourself first. And forgiveness is, uh, you know, shit happens, you know. Everybody's all right. We're no serial killers here. How bad can we get? And now, fuck it, the past is dead. Let's move on. We are forgiven. We are free here and now. Kingdom of Heaven is here.

**Speaker C:** And now.

**Speaker B:** Fuck it. We know not what we do. That's the Mohayana piece. We wouldn't do greed and hatred if we knew the pain of the hot coal we're holding. That's forgiveness. We know not what.

**Speaker A:** We do. Beautiful.

**Speaker B:** On that note, thank you so much, Brett. Thank you, Alexander, Dhamma, Ivan, Luke, Arillion.

**Speaker D:** Thank.

**Speaker C:** You, guys.

**Speaker A:** Much peace and love, and we'll see you next week or some other call. Much peace and love, dude. Yeah, take care.

**Speaker C:** Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Thanks, guys.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato and his Sangha friends, revolves around a core, practical insight: **the essence of Dharma practice is not to change life's inherent difficulties, but to change our relationship to them.**

Here is a summary of the key themes and insights from their conversation:

### Core Dharma Insight
*   **Acceptance of "Suchness":** Life is a mix of "good, bad, bunch of positive stuff, bunch of bullshit." The fundamental shift in practice is to stop struggling against this reality. As Speaker A puts it, "once we become okay with that, is it still fucked up and chaotic? No... the Dukkha changes into Sukkha."
*   **The First Noble Truth as Foundation:** The discussion consistently returns to the truth of *Dukkha* (suffering/stress). Freedom comes not from eliminating life's pains but from ceasing the inner struggle and "not liking" that multiplies them. Speaker B references Shinzen Young's equation: **Pain × Resistance = Suffering**.

### Practical Application
*   **Changing Attention, Not Circumstances:** The practice is about shifting our **attention, attitude, and relationship** to the mind and to experience, not about forcing the mind or world to be different.
*   **Real-Life Example:** Speaker C shares a story about irritation at work when a colleague asked for help after hours. He observed his desire for control and initial rudeness, but later apologized. The group praised this as exemplary Dharma in action—not being perfect, but using awareness to correct course and let go, rather than stewing in resentment.
*   **Right Speech & Listening:** Speaker F's inquiry leads to a discussion on Right Speech, highlighting the skill of **sometimes not speaking** and, crucially, **deep listening**. They note how simply being heard can alleviate another person's suffering more than any advice.

### Reflections on Tradition and Practice
*   **Essence Over Ritual:** The group values the direct, experiential essence of the Dharma over rigid rituals or institutional hierarchies. They discuss figures like Buddhadasa Bhikkhu and Zen masters who emphasized simplicity and non-attachment, even to religious forms.
*   **The Buddha as Human:** They contemplate the Buddha as a relatable human who may have experienced and expressed ordinary emotions, rather than an impossibly perfect figure. This makes the path more accessible.
*   **Skepticism and Testing:** There's an emphasis on the Buddha's reported choice not to write things down, encouraging a "come and see" approach. The teachings are to be tested personally, not believed dogmatically.
*   **Rebirth Interpreted:** They touch on Buddhadasa's "moment-to-moment rebirth" interpretation, favoring a psychological understanding over a purely literal one, while acknowledging other traditions (like Pure Land Buddhism) focus on future lives.

### The Spirit of the Sangha
*   **Friendship as the Practice:** The call itself embodies the practice. The supportive, non-hierarchical, and conversational atmosphere is seen as vital. It's a space to be heard, to share struggles, and to "gladden the mind" together.
*   **Joy in the Present:** The ultimate goal is framed as remembering and abiding in the peaceful, joyful awareness available **here and now**. As Speaker E illustrates, this practice leads to tangible benefits like effortless focus, calm in university, and naturally attracting others through one's presence.

**In essence,** the talk is a heartfelt exploration of how to live the Dharma amidst daily life. It champions **acceptance, present-moment awareness, and compassionate friendship** as the tools to transform suffering into peace, emphasizing that freedom is found not in a perfect life, but in a wise and relaxed relationship with life as it is.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use a rich tapestry of **metaphors and stories** drawn from Buddhism, other spiritual traditions, and everyday life to illustrate their discussion about Dharma practice, acceptance, and the nature of suffering (Dukkha).

Here’s a breakdown of the key metaphors and stories:

### **Core Metaphors**
1.  **Life as a Mixed Bag:** "Good, good, bad, bunch of positive stuff, bunch of bullshit." This sets the tone for accepting life's inherent duality without struggle.
2.  **Changing the Relationship, Not the Thing:** Dharma practice is described as not about changing the mind or external conditions, but about "changing our attitude, our relationship toward mind, attention toward the mind."
3.  **The Mathematical Equation of Suffering:** Referencing Shinzen Young, one speaker summarizes: **"Pain times struggle equals suffering."** The multiplier of "not liking" or non-acceptance turns pain into suffering.
4.  **The Finger Pointing at the Moon:** Referencing a classic Zen metaphor, the teachings (the finger) are a tool to point at the truth or experience (the moon). The danger is focusing on the finger (dogma, ritual) and missing the moon.
5.  **The Operating System:** Dharma practice is likened to building an "operating system" of wisdom that runs in the background of life.
6.  **Addiction to Dharma:** It's suggested that if the ego needs something to cling to, one should "become addicted" to the living Dharma—studying it, talking about it, making it the central focus.
7.  **Clothes as Superstition:** The act of wearing clothes is used as a metaphor for all the unconscious rites, rituals, and societal habits we adopt without questioning. It normalizes the idea that we are all engaged in some level of "superstition."

### **Stories and Anecdotes**
1.  **The Work Meeting (Luke's Story):** A personal, modern story about feeling controlled by a self-imposed schedule (wanting to leave work at 4 PM). His irritation at a colleague's request illustrates the creation of Dukkha through resistance. His subsequent apology and reflection show the Dharma in action: noticing the struggle, letting go, and repairing the relationship.
2.  **Rasputin:** Cited as a controversial figure who was "a big pile of shit mixed with a whole bunch of goodness." He's used as an example of the complex yin-yang of existence and the idea of observing things as they are without grasping or aversion.
3.  **Zen Masters (Ikkyu and Ryokan):**
    *   **Ikkyu** is recalled for scoffing at institutional Zen, seeing it as a money-making scheme, yet pragmatically accepting an abbot position in old age—demonstrating non-attachment even to his own strong views.
    *   **Ryokan** is described living simply in a leaky hut, spinning a bowl and laughing like a child. This story embodies the joy and simplicity found in being present, representing a truth that is felt rather than intellectualized.
4.  **The "Have a Cup of Tea" Zen Story:** Two monks are stuck in an intellectual loop debating the nature of reality (Tathagata). One ends the futile discussion by simply saying, "Come have a cup of tea." This story underscores the primacy of direct, present-moment experience over conceptual debate.
5.  **YouTube's Evolution:** Used as a metaphor for the human tendency to "fix something that isn't broken," creating complexity and sucking the soul out of things in a cycle that mirrors societal and political ups and downs.
6.  **The Young Women with a Subway Sandwich:** A brief, imagined vignette of people finding a moment of relief and connection in simple pleasure (sharing a sandwich) amidst life's chaos. It illustrates that the peace of the present moment is always available.
7.  **Jesus and the Buddha as Humans:** Both are mentioned as figures who likely "lashed out" in ordinary human ways but didn't cross into true harmful territory. This demystifies them and emphasizes that perfection isn't the goal; mindful relationship to one's actions is.

### **Referenced Spiritual Concepts (Acting as Metaphorical Frameworks)**
*   **Yin-Yang:** Used to describe the inseparable mixture of good and bad, beauty and "shit" in existence.
*   **Buddha Nature:** The inherent potential for goodness or awakening, even in a flawed figure like Rasputin.
*   **The First Noble Truth (Dukkha):** The primary metaphor for life's inherent unsatisfactoriness, which when accepted, can transform.
*   **The Simile of the Duck and the Chicken (Ajahn Chah):** Referenced to describe the futility of trying to fundamentally change the nature of things ("banging our head against the wall trying to change the duck into a chicken").
*   **The Concept of "Fruits" (from Jesus):** "By their fruits you shall know them." Used to argue that the truth of a teaching or person is revealed in their actions and outcomes, not just their words.

These metaphors and stories collectively build a conversation that moves from theoretical Buddhist concepts into grounded, relatable experiences. They emphasize **acceptance of life's raw texture**, the **transformative power of shifting one's perspective**, and finding **freedom not by eliminating problems but by changing one's relationship to them.**
