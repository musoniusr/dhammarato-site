### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, it'll start.

**Speaker B:** Sure. So I think the last topic we spoke about was about gladdening the mind. So not specifically focusing on anything with any particular intention, but just sitting there being happy in the present.

**Speaker A:** And talking yourself into it. That's the gladdening of the mind, using your thoughts to nourish and nurture yourself. Okay. And so, and by the way, it's good to have you as a student, and I wanted to announce that, and glad to see you again. And so The first thing that we can talk about is the statement that you made about trying to do it at night, trying to maintain the posture. Do you remember talking to me about that a couple of moments ago?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, sleeping on the side.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, tell me about that again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so I don't know how to position myself to sleep on the side because I have injuries on both my hands that require me to keep my elbows straight when I sleep. So it's kind of hard for me to position my hands in a way

**Speaker A:** such that there's— You're telling a new story. You didn't say what you said before.

**Speaker B:** Yes, well, that's— that is the specifics of my difficulty.

**Speaker A:** All right, you're still dancing around it. What you said was that you were trying to— remember that part of it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, still trying to sleep on my side. Yeah, and, and, oh, and then I woke up facing the ceiling.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and, and,

**Speaker B:** uh, forgot what I said after that.

**Speaker A:** That it's hard to do.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Where in fact the point is, is that you woke up and saw yourself facing the ceiling, and that was the moment in time of, aha, I see that I'm not sleeping on the side. So you, you woke up a bit, but not very much.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** Yes, you woke up and then had a thought of failure. I didn't do it. I'm not doing it right. Yeah, I failed. I'm not good enough. I've got to make an excuse about elbows and all of this kind of stuff. Yeah, this is what I'm addressing. This is not the gladdening of the mind. Okay, the gladdening of the mind is to wake up and stare at the ceiling and recognize, hot diggity dog, this is an opportunity to lay over on my side. Yeah, yeah, this is the practice right there. That encapsulates the entire practice right in that one moment. But what are we going to do in this particular moment when we catch ourselves screwing up? What are we going to do about it? Almost always we do about it what happened to us when we were kids. We were punished, we were put down, we were chastised. Because that's human culture. We go for punishment of wrongdoing rather than rehabilitation of wrongdoing. Yeah, this is what we mean by critical rather than nourishing. To begin to nourish yourself, and this is a point in time when we do that, is right now when we're waking up and recognize that I'm not in the posture that I had intended to be in, "Hot dog, wake up, I can see that!" And then, we can take the posture and be very comfortable coming back into the posture, that probably I'm even more comfortable after I roll over to my side than I was when I was laying on my back, which I had done mindlessly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so we can see that we can do that every moment. Every moment we have some sort of wake-up into something wrong, and then we dwell on it. Okay, we wake up to thinking about an email that has to be written. How many times has that happened? Every morning. All right, well, every time that happens, you have two choices. Actually, we always miss out on the two choices And we take a third option, and that is to continue to worry about it. But the two options are: one, put it out of your mind because you're not going to do it now, you're having too much fun to think about that email, or we're having too much fun to do the email. Why don't we have enough fun to not even think about it? Why do I have to think about it and mess up this moment when I'm not actually doing the email? Or the other one is, is that when we're thinking about the email, we're actually planning and plotting out so that when we actually do the email, it's easy peasy. Yeah, we could make the email easier while we're thinking about it, or we can actually just go do it. But what we do instead is worry about it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So just like you worried about staring at the ceiling and worrying about rolling over. You could have just rolled over instead.

**Speaker B:** That's true, that's true.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so this is the essence of the teaching of the Buddha, is in this moment, what are we doing? But see, you were plotting and planning way off into the advance of, oh, I'm going to be a good left-sider, I'm going to be a good right-sider, or whatever.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And then you felt like a failure, and it's hard to do because you had expectations of having already done it, when in fact you're not even doing it now. You're punishing yourself right now for not doing it rather than taking the opportunity to practice doing it. That's the habit we picked up as kids—punishment.

**Speaker B:** I don't necessarily feel bad about myself specifically, but there's a general disappointment. Is that the same?

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Okay, that's because you have disappointing little thoughts from time to time, leaving you left with a little bit of disappointment. When you stop having little disappointing thoughts, you won't feel that big disappointment inside anymore.

**Speaker B:** Okay,

**Speaker A:** it's that simple. It's simply a cause-effect relationship. We can think of it as a think-feel. Yeah, because the thinking affects our feelings, just as our feelings affect our thinking. It's a two-way street. An example of that is getting your opponent angry in the competition will put you to the advantage, that if you're clear thinking and watching what's going on and he's all really pissed off and intent on hurting you, he will leave himself open

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay. This happens in chess. It happened in 1972 in the World Chess Championship between Bobby Fischer and Boris Gasky. It happens in the wrestling ring. It happens in the boxing ring. It happens in martial arts, either in the movies or on the streets, not the dojo. It happens on the debating stage. They even have a rule about ad hominem attacks. You can't attack your opponent, you can only attack what his teaching is. But you don't call him an idiot because he's defending an idiotic position. All right, right. So that means that if you can attack him personally and get him feeling bad, then he won't be— then he'll be more— more intent on defending his self and his position than he is on convincing the audience that his side is correct. Isn't that interesting? Okay, when we know that, then we know that we are in this— in the self, in a way, we're going all around defending ourselves against perceived or possible conceptualized dangers. Yeah, when it— when in fact we're not. That that instinct of living in a dangerous world probably started when we were humans still living in the jungle 500,000 years ago, because it was dangerous and we need to keep our wits about us. Well, now we live, uh, in first lean-tos and then caves and then houses and then cities, all in order to make our species safe. And in fact, we've taken over the entire planet, but we still feel unsafe. You're in those cities, we still feel unsafe. We even call it a concrete jungle. But the real dangers in the cities is not from the rats and the sewers and the lions and the panthers and the elephants walking down the street. They're all in the zoos. No, the danger is the humans. And why are humans so dangerous? Because they're afraid of each other. So this is something that then we need to understand, is that fear— then when one is afraid, it puts his thinking in a certain pattern. And when he is feeling good and happy, then his thinking is in a different pattern, sequence. But you can also think about something that happened that will get you angry again over something that you're not— that was a long ago and you don't feel angry yet, but then you think about it and you get angry again. In that regard, we can see that the thoughts manipulate the feelings and the feelings affect the mind. There's a two-way street in there. This is actually pointed out in one of the steps of Anapanasati, to see that interrelationship between our feelings and the mind, because we're going to work with that very strongly in the sense that when we feel something, instead of having thoughts that are associated with that feeling, what we do is we inspect and investigate those feelings instead. Also, with the thought that when we have a negative thought or whatever kind of thought we have, we recognize and see those thoughts rather than taking down the road of the feelings that those kind of negative, unwholesome thoughts will bring up. We have gladdening thoughts or happy thoughts instead, so we don't wind up making ourselves feel bad. But in both cases, it's all about the feelings, because the way we feel is what drives our behavior.

**Speaker B:** Yep, yep.

**Speaker A:** That we are driven by our feelings of anger or disgust rather than thoughts of that's wrong or that's bad. Just a simple thought of it's wrong or it's bad is nothing, but when we really feel bad about it, it is bad. Yeah, that's when we take an action, either whether it's very slight or very subtle or very grand, uh, and, and big and obvious. It's still the same thing, that our thoughts affect our feelings and our feelings affect our behaviors and bodily functions, which also means that the bodily functions will affect our feelings. Therefore, the bodily functions also affect our mind state. Yeah, and there's many, many thousands of examples of that, including getting a broken arm and having it in a cast. You will start thinking about your arm a lot because it's broken.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** But if you're not— if the arm is fine, uh, and working correctly, we forget all about it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah. Have you heard about the pen in the mouth one?

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** Have you heard about the pen in the mouth one?

**Speaker A:** Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** There was a study where they took a group of people, they asked them what their mood was, and then they asked another group of people to hold a pen in between their teeth and ask them what their mood was. And the pen in between their teeth group rated their mood higher. Because they were smiling when they were holding that pen in their mouth. So yeah, I get it. I'm with you.

**Speaker A:** You're correct. In fact, that's a more subtle one, but you will change your mood if you start to smile, just like you will start to smile when you change your mood. That actually smiling will help change your mood. Just like they're— because they're interconnected. It's not a one-way street. It's not like a diode. It's just a wire. Yep, yep. And so when we smile— and not only that, but when I start smiling, getting joking, then the students do also.

**Speaker B:** Yep, yep. All right.

**Speaker A:** And that's natural. It's part of the human connection that we have that is instinctual within each of us. That's that nesting instinct, or going along to get along. But you can actually cheer people up with that. They go along with my laughter to get along with me, but then they wind up being cheered up.

**Speaker B:** Your laughter is infectious. But to go back on one of your earlier points about I think it was the past and the present with regard to this. I've been kind of picking up and filtering my thoughts, and usually it's like, you know, worrying about something in the future. You go, "No, that's the future. Focus on the present," or the same thing with the past. And that's helped with the stress.

**Speaker A:** Well, let's look at that "no" that you have. Because the source of that no is actually written in the language of the Ten Commandments: thou shalt not.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And it's an authoritarian no, which has a heaviness to it. And we're wanting to change even that right away. In other words, that's that critical parent of no, you can't do that. And we're going to change that from the critical parent into the nurturing parent, and the way that we do that is, "Aha, I caught you! I see that!" All right, and that's a completely different reaction than, "No!"

**Speaker B:** Right, right, and that's the Piti, the joy that comes from recognition.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the seed of it, that's the seed of the Piti. Piti gets really big. But that's the very seed of it, that's the start of it, is are you going to, when you have the Sati to see that that thought was an unwholesome thought, why the next thought has to be unwholesome too, even though you woke up? So you saw the— you have the thought, you see it, and now you have another unwholesome thought. Where is that going to take you?

**Speaker B:** Not to a good place.

**Speaker A:** All right, so that means that our Sati has to be strong enough to be able to change it, rather than just say no. And people in fact will go so far as to say, "Oh, poor me, this meditation is so hard to do. Oh, the mind wanders away every time I bring back to the breath, it just wanders away again. I'll just never get anywhere. Maybe I'm doing something wrong." Maybe the teacher is screwed up. Maybe this whole Buddha stuff is just imagination. I mean, they're all a bunch of crooks. All right, that kind of thought system happens in every meditation hall almost every day.

**Speaker B:** I'm sure it does. I have a Dhammarato in my head lounging in the bungalow saying, you don't need it, leave it, leave it, gladden the mind. So I picture you and it's a very happy no.

**Speaker A:** Well, okay, then it's not a no at all, it's an Anagami.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** It's an Arhat. Okay, it's a Gucci, Gucci, Gucci kind of thing rather than a slap.

**Speaker B:** It feels good to notice it. It feels good to notice it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it feels good to notice it rather than to feel dejected in the failure because you saw it. Like laying on the bed and you open your eyes or whatever and you recognize that you're staring at the ceiling. It's the same thing. It's exactly the same thing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. I'm a little bit of a grouch in the morning, so I have to work on that.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's not necessary. No. And when you said, I'm a bit of a grouch in the morning and I'll have to work on that, another way of saying is, aha, yeah, I can see that.

**Speaker B:** I did it again.

**Speaker A:** I know, and I'm listening. Yeah, because I have learned to listen.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so I import that skill to you. Start listening to the thoughts that you have. Yeah, because you can catch them and then you can say, aha, I see that, I can see that stuff.

**Speaker B:** So there's one thing I wanted to ask you about specifically with regards to these thoughts, because I think we segregated it into three main types. So we had the past, the present, And then we had junk thoughts. Where does music fall into that? So when I'm sitting— Your choice. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. That in fact, I just gave a long talk to a musician philosopher about music. And so I'll refer you to that when when it's published. It'll be published in the next few days. But in any case, the Buddha was not against music. Nacha Gita Vatidabha Sukkhadasana is the Western mentality, is no music any. All right, where what the Buddha was referring to is musicals and dancing and basically going to shows. The Vada Sukkhasana, uh, the word Dasa there is slave to Sukkha. In this case, it's talking about sensual desires. So we, we can see that wrapped up in the sense of sex, drugs, and rock and roll. Yeah, right there. The rock and roll is that integral part of sensuality. And going to shows and going to brothels and going to raves and going to discos and all of that because of the pounding music is what the Buddha was talking about. There is a different kind of music, and that would be the kind of music that is uplifting, which is much more of the classical especially starting in the time of the classics. But by the 1950s, it had gotten fairly good in the sense of Zippity Doo Dah and Que Sera Sera and a whole lot of uplifting songs. And if you can take the lyrics of the song and also the rhyme and the meter and the tempo, which is again repeating it over and over again. What makes a good poem, in fact, is the fact that it's dancing around one theme and it keeps talking about it over and over and over again. Okay, like the Ode to Joy, which is Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. It's an ode to joy. So if you just joyful, joyful, joyful, joyful over and over and over again, then you begin to feel joyful. People like that piece of music because it makes them feel so good. The same thing with other particular music is that it makes you feel good. But there's also a whole class of music— a dirge, a funeral march, requiems, all of that kind of stuff are beautiful in their own way, but it takes you into a state of sadness. That music has emotional qualities to it. So armed with that knowledge, you now can choose what kind of music is going to be wholesome and which kind of music is not going to be wholesome. Your choice, once you know. But if you have the idea that music, music, music is all good, or music is all bad, now we're not taking the middle path. The middle path is let's do this wisely and figure out which music is worth listening to and which music is not. Generally, most popular music is not worth listening to.

**Speaker B:** Yep, yep.

**Speaker A:** Because they're just playing the same old chord sequence that they've been playing for 100 years or two.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I agree with that.

**Speaker A:** Sometimes they experiment with stuff, and that's when the music becomes interesting, is because of the experimentation. And something new in it. A lot of people, they don't like new music. Yeah, it's also interesting that with the exception of George Gershwin, and mostly in the sense of— oh, there was quite a lot of them talking about the classical composers that came out of the 19th century into the 20th century All of the classical music got dark. Okay, Bela Bartók and, um, gosh, there's a lot of them at that time. Still did have— and because of, uh, his roots were in black blues and other things like that, he wound up with Wilting Tunes. Okay, so American in Paris and Rhapsody in Blue has a much more uplifting kind of feel than some of the heavier stuff, than in fact we even think of classical music as heavy, or in fact quite a lot of it is uplifting and very bright. And so what is your mind doing when the music is being played? Are you paying attention to it the way a musician would pay attention to it? Can you follow the score on symphony? Yeah. Can you detect when you're listening to a symphony orchestra which music, which instruments are being played, in which particular notes are— well, which particular notes, that takes a deeper skill, but at least identifying the instruments as you're listening to them and knowing and paying attention to what what's going on and appreciating the music, as opposed to just having the music go in the background while the mind is just grinding on with whatever it's going to grind on with.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm a drummer, so I'll be like playing patterns over and over, but I'm wondering, because that's kind of therapeutic in the same way, I wonder if that's a pacifier that's going to be a hindrance if I want to quiet the mind.

**Speaker A:** That's exactly the case that happens with most people. So this is, this is dangerous, right? But in fact, you know for sure that a song can get stuck in your head and you want to get rid of it and you don't know how. Yeah, I don't like it anymore. You liked it for a while, then you don't like it anymore. Notice that you changed. Yeah, yeah, that's an important point. It's not the song that you want to get out of your head anymore, it's the fact that now you don't like it. What changed? You can begin to start playing that song and begin to like it again. You don't have to throw the thing out.

**Speaker B:** That's true, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Or another way is that you can find a better song that you like and sing that to yourself. And then by doing that and concentrating and actually getting the second song, you kind of forget all about the first one. And then maybe bits and pieces of it it'll show up in a tenth or so of a second, maybe a note or two, and that's okay. Yeah, yeah, because now you got even a new symphony.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** But if you don't like it and you want to stop it, now you've created a problem for yourself, and that's what's unwholesome. It's got nothing to do with the music, it's what you're doing with it.

**Speaker B:** Ah, okay. I think, I think I'll stay away from now. For now, I can see myself wanting to calm down and still playing that song again. Like, you know, no, no, knowing that

**Speaker A:** it's better to turn it off. Exactly. That, that happens is if I listen to a symphony, I don't just listen to it for an hour, it plays. I gotta listen to it for 3 days. Yeah, at least that's how it was that one time in my life. Now it's not so much of a trouble. But anyway, yes, but that's just a passing kind of topic. The real issue is what is the mind doing in this particular moment? That's the real issue. Mm-hmm. And this is what we need to start looking at over and over and over again. Again, because every mind moment is a different mind moment, a new opportunity to be here now with this thought right now. Or in the reality where we're not actually doing much thinking because we're too busy experiencing through the other senses. Basically, it's kind of like this, that each sense door with six senses is almost just as an analogy like a six-shooter. Or a revolver, in the sense that we can spin that thing, but it's that the chamber is going to be one of six chambers. Okay. And so at any particular mind moment, we're either going to be seeing, we're going to be hearing, we're going to be smelling, we're going to be touching, we're going to be tasting, or we're going to be thinking. But we can't do all of them at the same mind moment time, but we can spin that barrel, uh, spin the cylinder fairly fast.

**Speaker B:** Uh-huh.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And so it's a good idea to start watching what you're doing, to start noticing when the mind is spinning or when it's chambered with a thought, or whether it's chambered with vision. And so the reason that we're now starting to pay more and more attention to the breathing is because that means that the breath is being chambered, which means that we're in the here-now, as opposed to avoiding that one particular— or actually, that one particular chamber, which is the thinking chamber, and that is thinking about the breath rather than actually watching the breath.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** Or having to watch the breath in the mirror because we don't know how to feel it. But nobody does that. Everybody can feel their own body breathing if you just pay attention to it. But when we're thinking about something else, we're not paying any attention to it. So which are you going to do with this mind moment? Are you going to be in senses? Are you going to be in your own outer space? Or maybe inner space?

**Speaker B:** Hopefully the latter. I want to ask you a question about the difference between— you said watching and experiencing, and I was reading about that as watching is a transition to the kind of automatic experiencing, if that makes sense.

**Speaker A:** We can think of it in the sense of the distinction between gazing and tunnel vision, or perhaps even the distinction between a telescope and a wide-angle lens.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right. Or in listening to music, are you just listening to the violinist playing the violinist concerto, or are you actually listening to the dialogue between the violinist and the timpanist while all of the other instruments are coming in and out and you're watching what's going on all over the place? A lot of people have the idea that meditation is a closing down and going deep into meditation like as if you were digging some hole and getting deep in there. Well, real, the practice that the Buddha has is not to dig yourself a hole, but rather to rise above it all so that you can get a better view of things. This is where the difference between Samadhi and concentration comes in. A lot of Westerners have the idea that they're supposed to concentrate. But if you're concentrating on this, you'll miss out on that. What we're working with is opening things up so that you can be here now with your senses, to be in the present moment, and having what thoughts that you have stay with this present moment rather than dragging you off into the past where you're not experiencing this present moment. Or into the future where you're not experiencing this present moment. And generally we see the future the same way that we saw the past, as dangerous. We saw the past as dangerous, so every time that we go into the past, we might reminisce and have a little fun for a little while, but then we're going to remember something that happened that's associated with that that makes us feel bad. That's why it's not a good idea to reminisce about the past is to stay in the present moment, especially in our own mind. I mean, you can tell a story to somebody and reminisce about the past that way, but when we're sitting there thinking about something that happened in the past, we're not only missing the present moment, but more than likely we're thinking about a problem that we had, and now we've got to fix that problem. We've got to make up something that happened in the past. So one of the best ways of being in the present moment is by not thinking much at all, but rather spending our mind moments in experience of the senses. So in that regard, watching is kind of like the tunnel vision of going deep into the hole, or another way that you can do it is like like focusing on a distant object. Let's say that the farmer is in the field and he stands up and he looks over at the woods and he sees a particular tree. Maybe it's the tallest tree, and he looks at that. Okay, that's a completely different example than the farmer bends up and he gazes at the forest, which means anything that's moving in that distant forest there, he's going to notice it because he's not paying attention to any particular thing. He's paying attention to the whole show. And so if there's enemies behind trees, he's going to see them, not because he's looking for them, it's because he's just looking, just gazing. Just noticing all there is to notice.

**Speaker B:** So is it— so if I'm understanding this correctly, it's not a focused concentration on the breath, nor is it an unfocusing, but a widening of focus, right?

**Speaker A:** It's a widening of focus, but we've got to start doing it someplace, and so we choose the breath for several reasons. One is because we're not focused, and in fact a lot of people want to practice focusing on the nose tip, but that's not in the suttas. What's in the suttas is experiencing the whole body, and that takes a whole lot of looking, and it starts with the breath. And in fact, the important thing is to notice, is this a long deep breath? In, and it's the long, deep breath out. This requires mindfulness because mostly our breathing is shallow. And so just watching shallow breathing, the mind's going to just trot right away because there's nothing interesting there. It's sort of like, have you ever heard of the story of the Dutchman boy that put his finger in the dike that kept the the dam from bursting and flooding the entire area?

**Speaker B:** No, I haven't.

**Speaker A:** Okay, the point is, is that he could have walked right by that leaking hole and not noticed it or paid any attention to it the way that we do with our breath. But actually, he had to come back and apply some effort to stick his finger in that hole But that's all he had to do to keep the whole show from falling down. Okay. And so this is what we mean by that, is to take the right effort to actually control the breathing. Because when we're controlling the breathing, we're controlling the mind. We're actually thinking about making sure that this is a long deep breath and this is a long out breath. But by doing so, we begin to notice the body and its breathing. We can see that it's breathing here, it's breathing here, it's expanding here, it's coming up here. We begin to recognize all kinds of things that are happening because we're actually focused on the breathing, but not just singularly on the breathing, but rather generally on the breathing and also on the thoughts that we have. And also on the feelings that are associated not with just the body itself, like anxiety is almost always felt in the chest area. But we're also paying attention to the kind of thoughts that we have. And so all of the Satipatthana becomes part of the practice, and every and each one of them is skill. A skill to to be developed. A skill of investigating the mind, a skill of investigating and gladdening the mind, a skill of investigating your feelings only in the sense of investigating how to make yourself feel good. Piti, in other words mindfulness of anger, is not in the Anapanasati Sutta. Mindfulness of frustration, Mindfulness of anxiety is not in the sutta. Mindfulness of Sukkha is in the sutta. Or let us say building the skill is actually stated this way: building the skill of Sukkha while mindfully breathing in long, and building the skill of Sukkha while mindfully breathing out long. Long. So you breathe in mindfully with Sukkha, then also means that we can have thoughts of Sukkha, but that's also mindfully gladdening the mind. So I gladden the mind as I'm breathing in, and I gladden the mind as I mindfully breathe out long. And with that mindfulness of gladdening the mind and investigating the mind, we do all of that while we're mindfully breathing in long and mindfully breathing out long. So there's actually quite a lot to do, but guess what? We've got plenty of time. But in fact, every breath, when we begin to slow it down, we're breathing not 20 times a minute, but we're down at about 5 or 6 times a minute. At 6 breaths a minute, that means that we've got 10, maybe 20 seconds.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Between the in-breath and the out-breath, a whole lot of going on in there. What's going on? All of it. Everything happens in that 20 seconds. The thoughts, the feelings, the mind's objects, everything. And so we're working with all of it at one time. This is what we mean by expanding rather than digging a hole. Because normally when people get into digging holes, they forget all about their breathing, they forget all about the way they feel, They forget all about their thoughts because they're too busy digging, trying to get deep into meditation or something.

**Speaker B:** So I'm trying to picture what that would look like in my mind, like as I'm meditating. So, you know, I'd sit there.

**Speaker A:** Okay, as you— here's an example again.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** First off, I remember to take a deep breath, and then I start to take that deep breath, and I begin to appreciate it with with the gladdening in the mind, "Oh, that's a good one, it comes in really nice," and then I breathe out, "Oh, that feels so good," and as I do I relax. Look how much I've already done. I've worked with the mind, I've worked with the body, I've worked with the breath, I've worked with the feelings, I've relaxed the body, it feels so good because I felt it, so I have done step 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 of Anapanasati as and step 9 and 10 and 6 and 7, and he's did all of that.

**Speaker B:** Well, you're certainly a master.

**Speaker A:** So I— you can too. That's the whole point. You can do this too once you begin to pick up looking at what you're doing. Look at these mind moments. Gladden the mind, take a deep breath intentionally gladdening the mind. You can do that with little mantras, in fact in the northeast Thailand they have a mantra of Buddha, with "Bu" on the in-breath and "Do" on the out-breath, but you put those two breaths together and you've got Buddha, that's it! I'm a Buddha, "Buddho." Then we can also use it in the sense of, as I breathe in, I breathe in joy, and as I breathe out, I relax and let it all go. In with the energy and out with the exhaust. In with the good and out with the bad. Let me throw all of that stuff out. So we can develop little mantras that go go that way. All right, and so that's the Anagami of the mind, letting go. And as we do that, we begin to get relaxed and begin to get joyful, especially when we can say things like, this in-breath is safe, and this out-breath is nourishing, and this in-breath is secure, and this out-breath is so comfortable, so relaxing.. And so we can work with Sukkha that way. I am so satisfied with this breath. Wow, this is such a nice breath. This is good enough. Wow, this one's going to keep me alive too. Okay, so these, these are the gladdening thoughts that we can have that wind up or actually go in the process of controlling the feelings through controlling the mind and controlling the body. Okay, I'm happy. And as we do this, we're developing or gathering together the factors. What are the factors? Now, the factors is, number one, that we're working with is removal of these hindrances, getting the mind out of unwholesome states, like the wholesome states of, oh, poor me, or, oh, I've got to look at the ceiling again because my arms hurt and I can't lay, roll over. Or any of those kind of unwholesome thoughts. We can throw all of that out and have the can-do kinds of thoughts. I can do this, everything is all right, all right. All I have to do now that I see that I'm on my back is just roll over and enjoy it. I don't have to fuss and kick myself in the butt because my butt's on the bed. So that's the important point, is to get the hindrances out of the mind. The next one is with the breathing is by breathing we're oxygenating, energizing the mind as well as the body, so we begin to feel more comfortable and more natural because we've got enough air to survive happily, as opposed to being at a minimum. We can actually think better. Also, by removing the hindrances, to do that we had to apply the mind to those hindrances and throw them out when they came, and we keep doing that. And so we're working with both applied and sustained thought, and by doing so we're making the mind fit for work. Also, because we're gladdening the mind and having wholesome thoughts and not hindering thoughts, we're no longer hindering the excellent good feelings that we can have. In fact, we're fostering these excellent good feelings rather than hindering them. And so we begin to feel good. We feel relaxed, we feel comfortable, we feel content, we feel safe and secure and satisfied. All right. As we practice more and more, we begin to get the attitude, I can do this. I can begin to think I am on top of my world right now. I can handle anything. All right. That's the right attitude that is developed to the attitude of a winner. We're no longer a victim. This is where the actual Piti comes in. The Piti is the feeling that you get when you— as they hand you the gold medal for just running the 100-yard dash in the Olympics. I mean, top quality. How good can you feel? To feel like a champion, that you've done it. All right, because what did you need to do? You just cleaned out your mind. The one thing that's the most difficult for humanity to do You just did it, you're a champion. That's Samma Sanghappa, this is right attitude, and that right attitude now is the completion of the ingredients that we need for first Jhana. This is the state of first Jhana, is that champion feeling that I've got it. And we continue to keep that because we can sustain the mind in that feeling and that idea of, "I've got it, this is it." And what have we got? We've got the Dhamma, we've got it, this is it. This is what I've been looking for, I've got what I was looking for, and I feel really good about that. It may not be everything, but it's enough. Okay, this is the point where we start the actual practice. This is the first Jhana. And so the very first thing that we have to do is to get rid of these hindrances and get the mind fit for work. And this being— having the mind fit for work is this first Jhana, different state than most people have, and it's got a huge amount of attitude built into it, where most people go into meditation with the attitude of a loser, with the attitude that this is hard to

**Speaker B:** do. Now I want to ask you a little bit about that too, because I, as you recommended and as the Buddha said, I went out to a park, I went out to the forest, or as close as I could get to it. And it was a beautiful fall day, and maybe I'll send you a picture if I can get a link to it later. But I felt what I think is like the joy that was like welling up, and then it was just like it reached a certain point. I'm like, I'm not allowed to feel this way, and it was just It was quelled in much of the same way that if I were to feel sad and like the feeling of crying would come up and then suddenly it blunts or is suppressed. It was that same type of like somebody reaching into your stomach and you flexing reflexively, kind of.

**Speaker A:** Funny that what you're talking about right now is exactly something that the Buddha said. He said to himself, "Why am I?" I afraid of this joy, that this joy that I'm experiencing right now is not sensual joy in the sense of going to the bar, going to the brothel, going to Wall Street, or going into sensualities or into the world? This is merely a feeling that's welling up inside. Why am I afraid of that feeling of joy? Yes, so the Buddha's had that also. We have to get over that and recognize that it's really, really okay to feel really, really good. The human being is capable of that, but human society can't make any money off of people feeling good. So our society wants everybody to feel bad. It's built in, it's systemic, they call it. Okay, except that human society is not systemically racist against people of color, it's systemically racist against humanity

**Speaker B:** itself.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's true. And everybody is miserable and everybody is in competition with everybody else for what they think of as insecure due to scarcity.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** To where really what we want is not all of the goods. We don't necessarily need to hoard goods, but really would be a good idea to hoard good

**Speaker B:** feelings. I like that.

**Speaker A:** I like that. Yeah, but let's build those up. Go out on that walk and go into that pastoral setting and really just— ah, this is so nice, it is so wonderful. That's why I live in the jungle. I live in paradise.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I thought about moving to Thailand more on more than one occasion.

**Speaker A:** Well, except for one thing. The important point is that the paradise is in here. It's not out there.

**Speaker B:** That's true. I suppose I'm chasing the bullet of taste with my fondness of Thai food,

**Speaker A:** so Ah, but recognize that the food that you do have is good enough.

**Speaker B:** That's good.

**Speaker A:** You can enjoy whatever food that you're getting. You don't have to say, I like that better than this. No, both of them are nourishing. Yeah. And so you can create your paradise. You don't have to come halfway around the world to find paradise. You just told me that you're not a block

**Speaker B:** away. That's true, that's true.

**Speaker A:** And when you get really skilled, it's going to stay right there in the room with

**Speaker B:** you.

**Speaker A:** Working on, working on— ah, playing with it is a better way of thinking about it. Playing with— working on it means it is the desire. Playing with it means it's already okay.

**Speaker B:** Playing with it.

**Speaker A:** Playing with it. Yeah, learn to play with things. You've got a human body. You've got one unique human body all to yourself, and all you have to do is just enjoy playing with

**Speaker B:** it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, it's a marvelous toy to play with. It's even got a built-in human intelligence, which is quite remarkable. Something really nice to play with. Yeah. And what do we do with it instead?

**Speaker B:** Oh man, we write

**Speaker A:** emails. And we don't enjoy them much.

**Speaker B:** No, no, certainly

**Speaker A:** not. Okay, so this is a— it's a change of mentality or a change of attitude that comes with the feeling of, I can do this. And this is what I want to impart upon you, is that you can watch your mind and see these unwholesome thoughts and recognize that these junk thoughts are often unwholesome, but that you can choose how you want to feel. That's the— that, if anything, that is the most remarkable wake-up point that Buddhism has to offer. The teachings of the Buddha have to offer this one thing that's so amazingly surprising, is that you do have a choice over how you feel right now. Because we have lived our whole lives feeling out of control of our feelings, that our feelings run us. Well, this is just the way I feel, and we even identify with this feeling. I am angry, or I am sad. No, you're not sad. You just have the feeling of sadness. How— why does sadness have to consume you completely to the point that you can make the statement, I am sadness

**Speaker B:** itself?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that's delusional. But when we recognize that sadness is often appropriate, it's kind of like a goodbye, a recognition so that we can let

**Speaker B:** go.

**Speaker A:** But we cling to it oftentimes, and people will be sad about something that happened 10 years ago. Every time they think of it, they get sad

**Speaker B:** again. Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, no need. Be sad and let it go. Say goodbye and let it go and be okay. You got along without it before you met it. You can get along without it now, whatever it

**Speaker B:** is. Yeah, that makes sense. I, I, uh, I was taught to think about it like, like food. So, you know, you don't, um, you become the food when you taste it, why they're good or bad. You just kind of taste the food, understand the feeling, appreciate it, not appreciate it, and kind of move on with—

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the important thing, is the moving on rather than you become the food. Yeah, yeah, because you didn't become the food, you just liked it and tasted it and enjoyed it right then, and it went inside and it nourishes you, and you can be grateful for this nourishment. Yeah, yeah. But you don't keep eating. You won't— you do not become that food.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** While you're eating a hamburger, you do not become a hamburger, except in our own

**Speaker B:** mind. Yeah, yeah. Good. Okay, I, I think I get that concept.

**Speaker A:** So

**Speaker B:** now, the— just to summarize, because I think there's been a lot of things a lot of new things from last week. There's, there's, um, when I'm sitting down, looking at the breath, the length of the breath, making sure it's, it's long and the body is, is calm, or at least, yeah. And then, um, looking at the feelings and the thoughts, the relationship between those, and making sure they're wholesome and nourishing thoughts and good feelings, cultivating good feelings, and then building the skill of Sukkha.

**Speaker A:** Building the skill of Sukkha, literally talking yourself into feeling good. Okay. Nourishing yourself is another way of saying it, that you're all right, you're okay already. As the Zen say, you're already an enlightened. There's a little Zen story about that, and that is the young student comes into the big room where the old master is sitting and says, Master, Master, do you meditate to become enlightened? And the old master says, No, I'm just sitting here because I'm already

**Speaker B:** enlightened. That's very nice. That's very nice. Zen has a lot of fun. I like reading those koans, those like

**Speaker A:** one-liners. Quite nice. Yeah, to stop the mind. Yeah, bring it out of the unwholesome into the wholesome. So that's it. Don't meditate to get anything. Meditate because you know how to enjoy

**Speaker B:** it. Yeah, that's I think the first call we had, you kind of knocked me out of the whole like first Jhana, second Jhana, third Jhana, fourth, you know, the hoops, and then you have to suffer in Dukkha to get to each one of them, you know. So it's been an adjustment in perspective for sure.

**Speaker A:** Precisely. And at the deeper level, the real deep part is when you begin begin to see clearly how much control you do have over the way that you feel. And not only that, but you have had that control all along and you were misusing it because you didn't know the power that you had over your own feelings. You thought that the feelings came from the outside. That's why people want to buy things, is to make themselves feel better, you know, shopaholics and all of that kind of stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, so now that we recognize that, no, I can in fact feel the way that I want to feel. I don't need anything in order to feel the way that I want to feel. I can just feel the way that I want to feel because I can talk myself into it, just like I talk myself into feeling bad and talk myself into feeling good. I can gladden my mind, I can brighten my

**Speaker B:** day.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that's the way that we do it, is just pay attention to how we feel while we're cheering ourselves

**Speaker B:** up.

**Speaker A:** I see. And here you've been criticizing yourself for not doing what you should be doing, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I have to bring it back

**Speaker A:** naturally to a natural state. You're already okay. You don't need anything. You don't need to be enlightened. Just relax. Sit down and relax and enjoy the moment.

**Speaker B:** I don't need to be enlightened. I need to sit down. Now that's a large pill to

**Speaker A:** swallow. May you take it in tiny little pilllets. May you not try to swallow it like a goose egg. Just one little breath at a time. Right now I'm okay. I don't need enlightenment right now. I just be okay right now in this particular moment. I don't need to be enlightened, I just need to relax and be

**Speaker B:** happy. I'm going to need— I'm going to need a lot of

**Speaker A:** sessions. Excellent. This has been really a good talk. I'm glad that you've got this. That's Great. Okay, thank you. Thank you too. Excellent. All right, well, we'll finish now, and I'll talk to you in a few days. You go practice a little more wholesome thoughts. Yes. Oh, what a nice deep in-breath this

**Speaker B:** is.

**Speaker A:** I like it so much.

**Speaker B:** It feels great. Well, thank you so much.

**Speaker A:** Thank you again.

**Speaker B:** See you later. Likewise. Take care. Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a student (Speaker B), centers on the core practice of **"gladdening the mind"** and transforming one's relationship with thoughts and feelings. Here is a concise summary of the key teachings:

### **Core Theme: Gladdening the Mind**
The primary instruction is to actively use thoughts to nurture and cheer oneself up, cultivating happiness and contentment in the present moment. This is framed as the essential skill in meditation and daily life.

### **Key Lessons & Instructions:**

1.  **Transform Criticism into Nourishment:** When you notice a "mistake" (e.g., waking up in the wrong sleep posture, mind wandering), replace self-critical thoughts ("I failed") with a joyful, nurturing recognition ("Aha! I see that!"). This moment of awareness is an opportunity to gently correct course, not a reason for punishment.

2.  **Thoughts and Feelings Are a Two-Way Street:** Thoughts influence feelings, and feelings influence thoughts. You can break negative cycles by consciously choosing wholesome, gladdening thoughts, which in turn generate positive feelings (Sukkha).

3.  **The Present Moment is the Practice:** The essence of the Buddha's teaching is found in what you do *right now*. When an unwholesome thought arises, you have a choice: follow it into worry/regret, or use the awareness to gladden the mind and return to the present.

4.  **Meditation as Expansion, Not Concentration:** The practice is not about narrow, forced concentration (digging a hole). It is about **expanding awareness**—being mindfully present with the breath, the whole body, feelings, and mind states all at once. Start with the breath to anchor in the here-and-now.

5.  **Building the Skill of Sukkha (Happiness):** Actively build the skill of feeling good. Use the breath as an anchor while cultivating gladdening thoughts ("This breath is safe, nourishing, good enough"). This combines the steps of Ānāpānasati (mindfulness of breathing).

6.  **You Have a Choice Over How You Feel:** The most revolutionary insight is that you are not a victim of your feelings. Through gladdening the mind, you can directly influence your emotional state. You don't need external things to feel good; you can "talk yourself into" happiness and security.

7.  **First Jhāna as a "Champion" Attitude:** The initial goal is to cultivate a mind free of hindrances, filled with wholesome thoughts and the joyful attitude of "I can do this. I've got it." This confident, nourished, and happy state is the foundation (first Jhāna).

### **Practical Examples Discussed:**
*   **Sleep Posture:** Waking up on your back instead of your side is not a failure; it's a chance to joyfully notice and adjust.
*   **Worrying:** Thinking about a future task (like an email) leads to worry. The choices are: 1) let it go completely for now, or 2) use the thought to plan efficiently. Don't choose the third option—useless worry.
*   **Music:** Music is not inherently good or bad. Be discerning: does it uplift and gladden the mind, or does it feed sadness or sensual distraction? The key is your relationship to it.
*   **Walking in Nature:** When joy arises, don't suppress it out of a societal habit. Allow yourself to feel profoundly good; paradise is an internal state you cultivate.

### **Overall Shift in Perspective:**
The talk moves away from a goal-oriented, striving meditation ("I must achieve Jhāna") to a practice of **playful enjoyment and nourishment in the present**. The message is: **You are already okay. Don't meditate to *get* enlightened; meditate because you know how to enjoy this moment.** The practice is about relaxing into your innate capacity for happiness, one gladdened thought and one deep breath at a time.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this dialogue, the speaker (A, likely a meditation teacher) uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate key points about mindfulness, self-criticism, and meditation practice. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Metaphors & Analogies:**
1. **Sleeping Posture as a Microcosm of Practice**  
   - Waking up on your back instead of your side is used as a metaphor for noticing when you’ve strayed from an intention. The key moment isn’t failure, but the chance to gently correct without self-judgment.

2. **Email Worry as a Habitual Pattern**  
   - Thinking about a future email represents how we often choose to worry instead of either acting or letting go. It parallels the sleeping example: we can either fix the issue now or release it, rather than dwell in anxiety.

3. **Sports & Competition Mindset**  
   - The teacher references chess (Fischer vs. Spassky), wrestling, boxing, and debating to show how anger clouds thinking. This illustrates the two-way street between thoughts and feelings: if you provoke an opponent’s emotion, they become less effective.

4. **Concrete Jungle vs. Ancient Jungle**  
   - Modern life is compared to a “concrete jungle,” where the danger is no longer wild animals but other humans—who are dangerous because they’re afraid. This explains why ingrained fear persists even in safe environments.

5. **Broken Arm in a Cast**  
   - Having an injury makes you hyper-aware of that body part, just as negative thoughts make you hyper-aware of mental suffering. When things are fine, we forget them—so we can learn to “forget” worries when they’re not useful.

6. **Pen-in-Mouth Study**  
   - (Mentioned by Student B) Holding a pen in your teeth forces a smile and improves mood. This demonstrates the bidirectional link between body and mind: physical actions can influence feelings.

7. **Six-Shooter Revolver**  
   - The six senses (sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch, thought) are likened to a revolver’s chambers. At any moment, one is active. Meditation involves noticing which “chamber” is in use and learning to choose the present moment (e.g., breath) over distracting thoughts.

8. **Dutch Boy Finger in the Dike**  
   - A story about a boy plugging a leak with his finger to save the town. This symbolizes the small but crucial effort of consciously deepening the breath to prevent the “flood” of mind-wandering.

9. **Telescope vs. Wide-Angle Lens**  
   - Meditation isn’t like tunnel vision (concentrating narrowly) but like widening your focus to take in the whole field of experience—similar to a farmer gazing at a forest to notice any movement, rather than staring at one tree.

10. **Digging a Hole vs. Rising Above**  
    - Common meditation is misconstrued as “digging deep” into concentration. True practice is “rising above” to gain a broader, clearer perspective.

11. **Food Tasting**  
    - Feelings are like tasting food: you experience them, but you don’t *become* the food. Similarly, you can feel sadness without identifying as a sad person.

### **Stories & Anecdotes:**
1. **Bobby Fischer vs. Boris Spassky (1972 World Chess Championship)**  
   - Used to illustrate how emotional disturbance (anger, pride) leads to poor decisions and loss of strategic clarity.

2. **Zen Story of Enlightenment**  
   - A student asks if the master meditates to become enlightened. The master replies, “No, I’m just sitting here because I’m already enlightened.” This underscores the theme that peace is already present, not a future goal.

3. **The Buddha’s Fear of Joy**  
   - The Buddha once asked himself why he was afraid of meditative joy (pīti), realizing it was blameless. This normalizes the student’s experience of resisting happiness.

4. **Music Examples**  
   - The teacher contrasts uplifting music (e.g., Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy,” Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue”) with “dirges” or repetitive pop music to show how art can cultivate wholesome or unwholesome states. This helps the student choose sensory input wisely.

### **Overall Themes Illustrated by These Metaphors/Stories:**
- **From Punishment to Nurturing:** Shifting from self-criticism (“thou shalt not”) to gentle recognition (“aha!”).
- **Thought-Feeling Loop:** How thoughts and feelings influence each other bidirectionally.
- **Meditation as Play, Not Work:** Approaching practice with curiosity and enjoyment rather than striving.
- **Paradise is Within:** Happiness doesn’t require external conditions; it can be cultivated internally through skillful thinking.
- **Choice in Emotional Response:** We have more control over our feelings than we think, often learned through habitual self-talk.

These metaphors and stories make abstract meditation concepts relatable and memorable, emphasizing a kind, playful, and aware approach to practice.
