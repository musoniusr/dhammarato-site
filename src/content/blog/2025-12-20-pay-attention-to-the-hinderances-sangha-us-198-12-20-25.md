### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So welcome, friends. Today is Saturday, the 20th of December. Some non-celebrated holidays are coming up soon, but like I said, we're not going to celebrate them. So today is going to be kind of a special talk. Is going to be out of the ordinary and that we're going to be doing some out-of-the-ordinary things because the topic of today's talk is the Five Hindrances. And it's not going to be just to talk about the Five Hindrances, we're going to do the Five Hindrances today. We're going to practice correctly. The Five Hindrances today. Now, on the occasion of many of the suttas, the Buddha would start the sutta off with the question of, is everybody going to listen attentively Listen closely, O monks, the Buddha would say. And then the next line in the sutta would be the monks responding, yes, Bhante, we will listen. So with that, I would like everybody to turn their camera on and everybody to turn their microphone on and answer that question. Are you going to be listening closely? Closely today.

**Speaker B:** Yes, we will listen closely.

**Speaker C:** We will.

**Speaker A:** Yes, right. Yes, yes, yes. Edward, how about you? Nick? Alexander? You're going to listen closely today. All right. Now, I would like it, in fact, if you kept both your camera on and your microphones on so that we can ask some group questions.

**Speaker D:** I will.

**Speaker A:** I'll be back now to get started on the Five Hindrances. The Five Hindrances, we're going to talk today about it in 4 or 5 different contexts, and that some of the contexts are absolutely ordinary. Now, most of the people here are finished with school, and so the advice that I have about school may not seem useful or valuable to you, but it's just a point, and we'll talk about it later. Now, what I mean by school— let me ask everybody a question, and that is, who Studies in school. Brad, who studies?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, in school.

**Speaker A:** Of the students who go to class, and let's say that there's an exam coming up, who studies for the exam? The night before, or— yeah, the night before, let's say.

**Speaker C:** Procrastinator.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I got that. How about you, Eddie? Who studies the night before the exam at.

**Speaker C:** School? I don't know if there's an Eddie.

**Speaker A:** Besides Edward, but, uh, student study. A student. Yeah, good energy.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I study the night before. Uh, nerds, we all study.

**Speaker D:** Somebody nervous.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, now you're getting there. Yeah, somebody with some doubt. Yes. Okay, now we're getting some place. In other words, The ones who study before an exam are the ones who were afraid, right? And why would they be afraid? Is because they know that they don't know the material. Is that right?

**Speaker D:** Yes, that's correct.

**Speaker A:** Okay, now what does that mean during class? Who in class then in class who is doing class so that he does not have to study the night before the exam? Brett, go ahead. Why is the people—.

**Speaker C:** The student who's paying attention, who's listening?

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's exactly correct. The one who is paying attention in class. Now, let me ask you this from your own personal experience. How many of you here paid attention in class?

**Speaker C:** Sometimes.

**Speaker A:** Therefore, you studied for the test because you knew that you didn't know the material. Who is it in class that is not listening and not paying attention? Everybody else I know. Students who don't care.

**Speaker C:** The distracted ones.

**Speaker A:** Students who are distracted, precisely. Distractions is a very good definition of the word hindrance. If you are paying attention in class, then paying attention is right effort. In our language, right noble effort to pay attention in class. What is the value of paying attention in class? It would be learning. It would be gaining skills in class. Is that not true, Brad?

**Speaker C:** That is true.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so those who are not paying attention in class, what are they doing? Some of the guys are looking at some of the girls, right? Some of them are looking out the window. Some of them may be thinking about lunch. In other words, the group that I'm talking about now are those that are in the hindrance of sensual desire. They're like, let us say, a beaker of water, maybe a glass jar of water, that has lilac or cinnamon or something to delight, and they're not paying attention and looking through the water, looking through it, but instead they're looking at what's in it. Is that not correct? That's sensual desire. Looking at the girls who wear makeup, looking at the girls who are not fully dressed, looking at all kinds of things that they take delight in. But what about the guys who are angry at the bully. And they're not thinking about what's happening in class, they're not learning anything, they're not paying attention. What they're doing is they're thinking about hurting someone, getting revenge. That's like the water that is, let us say, smoky or cloudy or steamy, or hot and boiling. Then when you're hot and boiling inside, it's hard to pay attention, isn't it, RJ?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, actually, this is— I've been experiencing for the last few months in my office also. Like, there are some sessions which you should listen, and I find myself distracted. In fact, like, a couple of days, like 3 days back, in 1.5-hour session I made it a point to put a dot every time I caught myself completely distracted. And it was 30, like every 3 minutes I was gone completely.

**Speaker A:** So you could stay focused for 3 minutes? I'm proud of you.

**Speaker B:** 3 minutes includes the time I was gone also. I don't know how long I was gone.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you weren't tracking it, were you? You're just estimating. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like when I'm gone, I won't know that I'm gone. Only when I come back, I know.

**Speaker A:** Ah, okay. So when students are paying attention, they know they're paying attention. And when students are not paying attention, they don't even know that they're not paying attention. Is that what you're saying?

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And that worries. And then I go into worry also that I'll be losing attention and I won't understand. So that's another fear and worry comes up.

**Speaker A:** All right, so now let's talk about a third one. We've talked about two: sensual desire, or paying attention to what you like, or paying attention to what you don't like instead of paying attention to what reality of what the teacher is saying. And then the next one is kind of complicated, and we'll go into it in the sense that It's more of the result of what's happening. And in the bad English translation, it's referred to as sloth and torpor, which can be actually boredom, dullness, not paying attention. Sloth goes almost all the way to sleeping. To going to sleep in class, not paying attention at all. But normally we don't get to the sloth and torpor until we're already in one of the other hindrances. Like for instance, you can be in sensual desire and then become bored with what's in class, stop paying attention altogether, and even stop the sensual desire and just go into a dull state. Oh, I wish it were over. Now, in the water analogy— and by the way, these water analogies that I'm giving come from the Samyutta Nikaya, the 46th, which is about the hindrances— and that the third is with water that has plants or algae or water lilies on the top so that you can't see even into the water. And that means that all the oxygen is being sucked out. So the way to handle sloth and torpor is by taking a deep breath rubbing your arms, waking yourself up, come back with intention, with strong determination to start paying attention to what the teacher is saying. But how did we get into that state? Well, normally we get to it through one or the other of the five hindrances. The next one on the list is restlessness, or sometimes translated as remorse or worry. Now, the water analogy for that one is wind, or maybe shaking up, that the agitation of restlessness— that in fact restlessness can be referred to as boredom But there's two different kinds of boredom. One is the boredom of, "I've got to go do something else. I don't like what's happening here." And then there's also the restlessness of, "Why bother?" Also, the idea of remorse is not liking what's happening or not liking what just happened. In other words, we have a thought about the past. Hi, Ivan, I thought that you weren't going to make it today, so I'll ask you this question: what kind of remorse do you have about in class not doing one's homework? Oh, I wish I'd have done the homework.

**Speaker C:** Oh, hello. Yeah, uh, yeah, that sort of remorse. Yeah, like, oh, poor me.

**Speaker A:** I've done it. Oh, I'm going to get a bad grade here. And that kind of remorse then leads into, oh, why bother, I've already screwed up. And so remorse easily leads into sloth and torpor. And then the fifth one is called doubt. Now doubt is all kinds of— it's all over the place. Doubt about the teacher, doubt about her credentials, doubt about what's going to happen after class. The bullies are in the class, so are the girls. What's going to happen after class? And so we start thinking about future. What's going to happen? And so this also, but we'll get into this later, happens with students who are practicing meditation. Oh well, what about this and what about that? Now, um, along with this paying close attention that we're talking about, the paying attention in class also has the quality of discernment. For instance, the teacher may be wrong. Are you aware that the teacher is wrong because you already know the material? If the teacher is wrong, what are you going to do about it? You said blah blah and I know blah blah. So, um, that actually reminds me of a discussion between Neil Bohr and Einstein. Do you know anything about Neil Bohr? He's the one that came up with quantum physics. He's the one who has spooky interaction at a distance, and Einstein just wouldn't buy it. And the reason that Einstein wouldn't buy it is because Bohr was talking about it in the sense of when you check that particle and then you check this particle, you find that they've got opposite spin. How did this one, when you checked it, when you checked the first one, how did the second one know to take the opposite spin? And the answer to that was, is that the spin was determined before they were checked. It's kind of like, imagine that on a ship, what arrives in port.

**Speaker D:** What.

**Speaker A:** Arrives in port What was loaded on the ship is what's going to be unloaded at the dock. The stuff on the ship didn't magically appear, that it was already loaded onto the ship. Okay, now this is an important point in the sense of paying attention, because the knowledge that the teacher had was already old. She didn't make that shit up. She learned it. She's not making it up now, that this is old data, but you, the new student, are picking it up only if you're paying attention. So this is where the doubt comes in that has some value to it. Because now we're going to listen closely at what's being said so that we can determine whether it is correct or not based upon other information. Now we also have to deal with confirmation bias, that maybe the teacher said something that's right, but I believe something different than that because I learned it at church. But that happens often when the students get into a biology class and they begin to talk about evolution, and the child goes nuts because the teacher is disagreeing with what he learned in church. So that's kind of confirmation bias. But if the student will continue to investigate continue to search, continue to listen, and gain other information, he may in fact be able to come out of his confirmation and bias, but it all has to do with investigation, investigation, investigation. At the same time, we see that also, using the water analogy, that Doubt often, in fact in this sutta, is referred to as murky or muddy water. So we have lilac and scented water, we have boiling water, we have water that has water lilies and algae and stuff in it, we have water that is stirred up, whipped by the wind, etc., like that. And then we have muddy water. These 5 kinds of waters are the 5 that are associated with the 5 hindrances. And where I learned them first was out of the Visuddhimagga. But I'm not using the Visuddhimagga. I would rather use the suttas because of the Visuddhimagga. Guess where they got it? Out of the suttas. Okay, so now that we have talked about school, let's go to the next one, and that is actually just reading. Now, when we're saying reading, we're talking about reading a book, reading an article, reading a newspaper. Now, how many of you have found something that you like, that you want to read it, you start reading it, and by the second paragraph you're lost. Why? Because when you saw the— uh, you began to read, you read something that you liked, and so you started thinking about what you liked. The eyes will continue along the page, but guess what? The eyes are taking in the data, but the mind is busy somewhere else. If you're lucky, you'll see that and recognize, oh, I've gotten to the end of the page here, and I don't have a clue about what was on that page. Let me go back and reread it. Do it again, over and over again, until I actually understand what's on that page. And generally, 2 readings or 3 readings will be enough unless we go back into hindrances. And this is quite possible that you can read a page over and over and over and over again and never get anything out of it, because every time you go into that page, you go right back into hindrance. I think Brett and Alex know exactly what I'm talking about. So this is how You will have the hindrances. You can't even read a page without hindrances coming up. You can't sit through a class without hindrances coming up. Now, we could go a little bit further than that about the reading and take something else. What about our Discord group? How many of you read the first paragraph of something that somebody says and immediately you don't like it? Oh, I gotta answer that. Oh, I've got to put and you haven't even read it all yet. So what's the right thing to do then is to recognize that we've got a responsibility to read and understand and take all in what someone on our group has said, and only then will we formulate an answer to it. But most of us don't do that. We'll read one word we don't like and all of a sudden we're all frowning on them. Okay, such are the kind of hindrances. And on our group, we should be free from the hindrances when we're talking about the Dhamma. Yeah, so go ahead, Alex.

**Speaker D:** Oh, I was just agreeing. Yeah, coming out of the hindrances makes it so that we look at and see what's here and remember it and recall it again later. If we're in the hindrances, there's not really a chance it's going to be very much help later on.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So one of the values of paying attention is we're making a payment and we're getting something in return, like a business deal. What are we getting in return for our paying attention? Knowledge. And when we keep referring to it over and over again, we begin to correct that knowledge so that we begin to get correct knowledge. And if we keep looking, it will be turned— it will return to noble right knowledge. But we have to do it over and over and over again because these hindrances are going to prevent you from getting it the first time. Now, the next group that we're talking about is— what about, uh, Ivan, you mentioned this— what if you're in a conversation with someone? Normal conversations have the following quality: is one person is talking while the other one thinks about what they're going to say. And as soon as the first one shuts up, the second one starts to talk. And while he's talking, the first guy is not listening. He's trying to figure out what he's going to say next. We don't listen to each other. Why is that? Because of the hindrances. We're not paying attention. We either heard something she said that we liked, or she said something and we didn't like it, or she said something and we got bored with it, or she said something and we got into, oh, she's blaming me, and we get into remorse. Or maybe she said something and we're doubting it, and we wind up not listening to each other. So, um, one of the things that I will present to you here, the part of the cure for that, and I'll give it to you in the way that I would see things, especially my relationship to Tam, is, is that when I interact with her, I do so in a way of generosity. What can I give her? What can I give her to make her feel good? The most recent thing was, is that, uh, she tried to rent the room of her new apartment and the guy didn't come, or he changed his plan, and she didn't like that. And I says, whatever it takes, be okay. If you need some money, I'll give you some money, no problem. That's one of the reasons why she says she loves me, is because my interest is to not get anything from her, but rather to help her in every occasion. So this would be the way, Brett, that you can start dealing with your wife, is instead of wanting something from her, spend your time with her in the sense of what can you give her that she will like, What kind of verbal gifts can you give her that she will enjoy?

**Speaker C:** Verbal, or space, or give her her—.

**Speaker A:** Give her her attitudes, give her her opinions, right? To be really— she's going to hate you for it because she's not paying attention.

**Speaker C:** Been down that rabbit hole before.

**Speaker A:** You've heard that before, haven't you?

**Speaker C:** I've been down that rabbit hole.

**Speaker A:** All right, so this is the way that we would handle that. Now, how much time do we have left? Okay, so the next one then with these hindrances— first off, if you look at it We're talking about ordinary reality. We're talking about going to school. We're talking about reading a book. You can also put this onto watching a video. If you're watching a video, you know, that video is just going to continue on, or the audio is going to continue on whether you're paying any attention to it or not. How many times have you started an audio or a video and it's just playing on and you're just blah blah blah blah blah up into hindrances, and you don't even know it because you're not paying attention. So what we're going to be getting out of this talk today is the quality of it's your responsibility. In fact, it's your job. In fact, it's the only job that you will ever have. The only real work that you'll ever have is to pay attention, to look at what's going on, and to keep looking what's going on over and over and over again. The Buddha calls this right noble viewing or right noble investigation. That's the job that needs to be done, and we've talked about it many times in the talking about the Eightfold Noble Path, that we talk about remembering to look, to investigate, to see, and then to change. Now that change is right noble effort. But let's introduce it like this: doesn't remembering take some effort? Doesn't the actual investigation and the looking pay, uh, require effort? Doesn't paying attention to the teacher require effort? Doesn't listening to the video— I mean, you started it, you must have wanted to watch that video. Why are you playing it, not paying attention to it? It takes some effort to keep paying attention. So the same thing now With the Eightfold Noble Path and actual right practice, the only kind of practice that would be called right noble practice is, guess what? Paying attention. Pay attention, wise noble view, to look, to see. In fact, in the Sābba-Asava Sutta that we covered the other night, we kind of glossed over it, But the knowledge is gained by looking for the Dukkha. Look for the Dukkha, recognize the Dukkha, see the Dukkha, and then change it. In other words, and when you're in class, can you recognize that you're not paying attention to the teacher? And then you take the right noble effort to start paying attention to the teacher. Wouldn't it be nice if you could push some button in the air and the teacher would rewind 10 minutes? Teachers don't rewind, but the video does. So you can rewind it and start paying attention. But guess what? Reality is much like the teacher. Reality and your mind just goes on. There is no button for you to push to rewind your mind. So it's time for you to start paying attention to what the mind is doing right now, to look, to pay attention, to see, and to see what the mind is doing. Now that's hard. It's actually— when I start with the teacher and paying attention in class, that's actually kind of easy to do. Especially when the teacher turns around and looks at you and points at you and says, 'Johnny, pay attention.' Guess what? Your mind is not going to do that. The book is easy enough because if you can catch yourself that you haven't been paying attention, you can back it up. Same thing with a video. But in a conversation, you can't back it up. And almost always, not only are you in hindrance, but so is the person whom you're talking to, and you're not even aware of that. That in fact, the general thing is, is that you think that, oh, she's paying attention to me and I'm paying attention to you, and neither one of you are paying attention to each other. So now we're talking about the practice of the Dharma. That's the most difficult of all. Can you in fact start a practice of actually looking at what the mind is doing with right noble view and then begin to continue to do that, knowing that you've got a job to do, and your job is to pay attention to what the mind is doing, and if it wanders off into a hindrance, your job is to bring it out of the hindrance. Now, a lot of people will say, "Well, so what? So what? Why should I—" Mr. Ben! Why should I come out of hindrances? I mean, I've been in hindrances for all of these years and I'm okay. Why should I come out of the hindrances?

**Speaker B:** I think so. Hindrances, like I've been in hindrances for years, but I'm not okay with them. I can see at least that, like, they're causing big problems in my life.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, then in fact, our problems is the root cause. The hindrances are the root cause of all problems.

**Speaker C:** All problems.

**Speaker A:** All problems. Every problem that you ever had is caused because you're not paying attention. You're not paying attention to what you're thinking. You're making shit up. You're confused, you're in doubt, you're worried, you're caught in sensuality, and you're angry. All of this stuff is caused because we're not paying attention, either on the inside or the outside. Now here's the value: if you start paying attention to what's happening on the inside— it will in fact rub off so that you can pay better attention on the outside. But it works both ways. If you have the strong determination that you're going to start listening to your spouse and listening to your friends, if you have the strong determination that you're going to actually pay attention to what people are writing in the Discord group and respond to it wholesomely, then that will rub off on your internal process. Is that not.

**Speaker D:** True?

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's very true. Yes, it's true that if you practice one, it'll rub off on the other. So we need to practice both, but we actually do need to actually practice practice the Eightfold Noble Path in the sense of looking. And that if we do this practice— you've seen me talk about it before— that if you come out of unwholesome thoughts, the hindrances, the distractions, and come into wholesome thoughts, that actually begins to build up as kind of a strength. So that we become comfortable, we become happy, we become lack of fear because we're not in doubt. Fear actually comes from doubt. And when we're paying attention, we don't have so much doubt. In fact, we have none at all because we can see. And if we have doubt, we've got just the tool we need. Pay attention so that you can come out of the doubt. You can reevaluate, look again, over and over and over again. So now it's time that we do the last part of it, which is actually part of Sutta Number 39. Now, I'm not going to go through the whole sutta, but there is a passage in that sutta about the benefits of coming out of the hindrances. The first one is sick, like you're in the hospital. They didn't use the word hospital, but they used the word sick. What happens when you're sick? You don't feel good. Oh, poor me. Oh, my belly hurts. Oh, my head hurts. Oh, my toenails are too long. Oh, there's just all kinds of problems. But when you start to feel good again, you stop paying attention to all the worries and all the feelings, and you begin to feel good. Hey, I feel good! I'll tell you what, have— who here has actually been in the hospital? All right, what's the very best thing about being in the hospital? Being discharged from the hospital, that's the very, very best part of being in the hospital, is getting out. All right, so the very best part of the hindrances then is getting out. You feel better. Feel good. Now, the next analogy is being in jail. You're bound up, you're in a cell. What's the best part about being in jail?

**Speaker D:** Getting out of jail.

**Speaker C:** Release.

**Speaker A:** Getting out of jail. Getting out. Okay. The next analogy is being a servant. Now, many of you are— we don't say all you're indentured servants, but you certainly are servants to your job. You got to go in, you got to stay there, you got to be in hindrance, you got to suck up to the boss and all that kind of stuff because you don't like the job. But what's the best thing about the.

**Speaker D:** Job?

**Speaker A:** When the job is done. Out of it. When the job is done, right? And yet most people, when they lose their job, they're miserable rather than recognizing that's the best thing that ever happened. Now I don't have to go back to that place. You start singing Anagami, Anapanasati, song, Take This Job and Shut Up. So now we can have freedom. Well, guess what? Don't we give ourselves an awful lot of work to do? Don't we buy things? We see it, we have the— oh, I like it, therefore I buy it, and now I've got to pay for it. Wouldn't it have been better that you didn't buy it at all? Because if you don't buy it, you don't owe anything, and now you don't have to go to work to pay for the stuff that you.

**Speaker C:** Bought.

**Speaker A:** So you can actually say that in fact going shopping is a hindrance to being happy. And yet look how many people are shopaholics. They think that they gain their pleasure by shopping, to where all they're doing is making a bunch of misery. Now then, the next one, um, does anybody have any questions about that? Okay, so the next one is, um, that you're in debt. But in fact, that's the whole point. You can see that being in debt and being a servant are almost identical. Indentured servitude meant that you owed money anyway. Debtor's prison, etc. And so this is an important one. And if you are free from debt, Alex, if you are free from debt, wouldn't you feel a lot better? Oh, I don't owe anybody anything. Oh, wonderful. The mortgage is paid, the car is paid.

**Speaker D:** Off.

**Speaker A:** Nothing to worry about to make because I don't have any long-term payments. I'm free. Well, what about when you're free from the hindrances? You don't owe anybody anything. In fact, all the problems that you made up aren't there anymore. Paid those debts. That's the job that we need to do, is to pay off those mental debts. And now the last one is imagine that you're in a desert. Maybe you're a camel jockey, that you've got silks and salamanders and robes and perfumes and all kinds of things on your a camel, and then you get to your destination, and you get there with all your goods, and you can wind up and relax. You can't relax out in the desert, not at night. It's cold at night. Robbers are out at night. But when you get home, then you feel comfortable and safe You can get somebody to unload your camels and they can feel safe and secure and at home. So these are 5 analogies, but these 5 analogies, not like the water— each one of the waters has a particular analogy for a particular hindrance— but these 5 all have the quality of relief. Losing the job, getting out of the hospital, getting out of jail, getting out of debt, and getting out of your journey. It's all a matter of getting out, and it's all feeling really good. This is the quality that we're looking for, is being free from debt, the debts that we meet up, being free from the journey. What journey? The ones that were on in our mind, the restlessness, the going and going. But when we're free from the hindrances, then we're free from debt, we're free from the journey, we're free from the job, we're free from prison, and we're free from the hospital. Wow, what a relief it is! This is the value. This is why I asked Ben, what's the benefit? What's the benefit of being free from the hindrances? Wow, life is easy now. It wasn't easy when the mind was full of hindrances, but now that the mind is free from hindrances, life is easy. What about reading a book? If you read a book without the hindrances, the book is actually easy to.

**Speaker C:** Read.

**Speaker A:** How about in class? If you're paying attention to what the teacher is saying, then you're ready for the exam because you already know the information. How easy is that? The only reason students need to study is because they weren't paying attention in class in the first place. So enough of this. Nick, what do you have to say about.

**Speaker B:** This?

**Speaker A:** Sorry, give me a second. I was just putting.

**Speaker B:** My, uh, um.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I agree with you. Well, it's not a matter of agreeing with me. I mean, I'm just quoting sutras. I've gone through 3 of them today. Well, ask me a specific question, I'll give you a specific.

**Speaker C:** Answer.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay. Uh, how determined are you to come out of your hindrances? Very determined. That's the whole point of this talk, is to give everybody the determination to come.

**Speaker D:** Out.

**Speaker A:** To come out of the hindrances, to come out of the hindrances when you're in class listening to someone else talk, when you're reading, when you're watching a video, when you're in conversation with someone. Come out of your hindrances and pay attention to what's happening. And mostly when you're sitting alone with nothing else to do other than watching what the mind is doing, doing. Watch what the mind is doing. Don't just let it go off and spin around, because there's no rewinding. Look at what you're doing. Pay attention. Come out of your own mental hindrances, and that will be of great fruit, of great benefit, of great value. Naved, what do you have to.

**Speaker C:** Say? I was about to write this down before I forget it.

**Speaker A:** No, you don't need to write this down. You need to remember.

**Speaker C:** I just realized that. I just realized I took the attention away by doing that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, writing stuff down, you pull your attention away from it. In fact, you can say that taking notes in class is a hindrance. While you're writing, you're not listening. If you pay attention, it'll come in. The value of paying attention is, is that the data comes in and you receive it, and you know that you've got it. Therefore, you don't have to go into the hindrance of I need to study. All right, I need to write this down so that I'll remember. No, you don't need to write it down. You need to remember. This is the reason why I'm giving this talk today. This is why I'm so tough teacher.

**Speaker C:** Today.

**Speaker A:** I'm having a ball being tough teacher today. You don't need to write stuff down. You need to remember. And how can you remember is by paying attention and letting the data come in in the first place. And repetition over and over and over again. But the repetition doesn't mean that you got to read your notes. But rather going over it and over it. 1, 2, 3, 4.

**Speaker B:** 5. Dhammarato, one question.

**Speaker A:** Yes, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** So I was actually struggling with the same problem in my office that there are sessions where somebody is giving some knowledge. And for the last 10 years I have been noticing that I don't get much out of them. And for a long time I believed that this is just how I am, like I'm not able to focus, things like that. But after this practice at least I understand that it can be handled and I can learn that skill. So, I tried something intentionally that I want to focus and I want to come back. And in that, actually taking notes, not so that I can come back and read them, but more for just as an anchor of staying there. I used taking notes also. It seems to.

**Speaker A:** Help. Well, we can say that taking notes would be, let us say, a beginner's.

**Speaker C:** Crutch.

**Speaker A:** Because if you are taking notes, you have to listen to a little bit in order to write the notes down. Look at it like this, like a bicycle, that in order for a child to learn to ride a bicycle, we need training wheels. Yeah, and sometimes we need to keep those training wheels on that bicycle a year or two until the student feels very comfortable at riding a bike. But if he's very good at riding a bike, he wants those training wheels to come off because he recognizes those training wheels actually get in the way. I mean, how many of you have ever seen the, um, Le Mans or the bicycle races they have in France, the Tour de France or whatever, and You see somebody out there on a bicycle, this guy training. Yeah, so see the, uh, taking notes as training wheels to get you to focus and pay attention. But once you can focus and paying attention, the wheel— the training wheels come off, and now you're riding high. You're riding fast. You're very good at what you're doing because you have trained the mind to pay.

**Speaker D:** Attention.

**Speaker A:** And I can drone on and on about the Eightfold Noble Path and the Four Noble Truths, but until somebody actually practices it, they're not going to get any value out of it. So this is what it's all about. You must practice. That's why I asked at the beginning of this talk, is everybody going to pay attention to what I'm saying? Because if you are paying attention to what I'm saying, perhaps that means that you're also going to start paying attention to what you hear, what you read, what you think, and start paying attention to everything. Not all the time, but whenever you can remember. And then make remembering a skill. That's part of the right noble effort, is to remember. So, Timo, what do you have to say? Not much, or nothing at the moment. I'm just paying attention rather than talking. Okay, how about you, Ivan? What do you have to.

**Speaker D:** Say? Ivan says he can't.

**Speaker A:** Speak. Can't speak. Are you taking notes, Ivan? Tom, what do you have to.

**Speaker C:** Say?

**Speaker A:** Oh, good stuff. I'm paying attention here. All right, how about you, Edward W.? Are you paying attention? Can you hear me? Yes, yes, I think I'm paying attention. Excellent. How about you, Eric the Potato? Are you paying attention? He's not paying attention. Yes, thank you, Dhammarato. Okay, but now you're here. All right, Sheep, this one's for you. Maybe a little bit late. But don't you recognize that the trouble that you've been having in school is because you haven't been paying attention? Hello.

**Speaker C:** Sheep.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker C:** Hello. I see.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, we need to practice. Yes, you need to start practicing. Practicing listening, practicing meeting, practicing having wholesome thoughts when you put stuff on Discord, but mostly you need to practice having wholesome thoughts in the mind. Practice, practice, practice over and over again to throw those hindrances out. I think I've talked to everybody. RJ, you have something final to.

**Speaker B:** Say? I think this is something that I was struggling very recently, and I was even discussing with Amit. He also joins from the UK time. I was discussing with him, like, what should I do, how to handle this? And I think this talk is very useful to.

**Speaker C:** Me.

**Speaker A:** A way to handle it. This talk should be handy for everybody here, beginners, adepts, enlightened ones, old fat men, every one of.

**Speaker C:** Them.

**Speaker A:** All right, does anybody else have something to say? Brett, do you have.

**Speaker C:** Something? Every teaching on the Nivarana, on the five hindrances, is exceedingly practical. It's refreshing. Thank you. It's like the way the Dharma was seen here was through again and again through the disappearance of the hindrances. And it's always a wonderful feeling.

**Speaker A:** Seclusion of the.

**Speaker C:** Mind. Yeah, it is.

**Speaker A:** It's better than that. Yeah, it really is. Now here's one thing about that, getting out of jail. How many people feel really wonderful getting out of jail, or don't they continue to be angry with the.

**Speaker D:** Jailer? They never let themselves out.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, they never get out of jail because they won't let themselves out. They've got to get rid of those.

**Speaker C:** Hindrances— restlessness and.

**Speaker A:** Remorse. Exactly. So, Mikey, why don't.

**Speaker E:** You take it home? Gladly, yes. This was a splendid call to pay attention.

**Speaker A:** To.

**Speaker E:** Also, I'd like to point people here to the YouTube channel, the Dharma Friends YouTube channel.

### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A), is a practical and interactive exploration of the **Five Hindrances** (Nīvaraṇas), framed as obstacles to paying attention in daily life and meditation.

### **Core Theme:**
The central message is that **all problems stem from a lack of attention** caused by the Five Hindrances. The path to freedom and happiness is to consistently recognize and abandon these hindrances through "right noble effort"—the deliberate practice of paying attention.

### **Key Points & Structure:**

1.  **The Call to Attention:** The talk begins by emulating the Buddha's style, asking all participants to verbally commit to listening closely, setting the tone for active engagement.

2.  **The Five Hindrances Explained Through Analogies:**
    *   **Sensual Desire:** Compared to being distracted in class by something appealing (e.g., looking at others), like water colored with dye.
    *   **Ill-Will/Aversion:** Compared to being angry or planning revenge in class, like boiling or cloudy water.
    *   **Sloth & Torpor:** Compared to boredom, dullness, or sleepiness in class, like water covered with algae.
    *   **Restlessness & Remorse:** Compared to agitation, worry, or regret about the past/future, like water churned by the wind.
    *   **Doubt:** Compared to skeptical uncertainty about the teacher or material, like muddy water.

3.  **Practical Contexts for Practice:**
    The hindrances are examined in everyday scenarios:
    *   **In School/Learning:** Not paying attention in class leads to last-minute, fear-based studying. Paying attention is "right effort" that leads to true knowledge.
    *   **In Reading:** The mind wanders due to hindrances, causing re-reading without comprehension.
    *   **In Conversation:** We often plan our response instead of listening, a failure of attention rooted in hindrances. The antidote is generosity—focusing on what you can give (understanding, space) to the other person.
    *   **In Meditation/Dhamma Practice:** This is the most crucial application. The "job" is to pay attention to the mind itself, recognize when it is in a hindrance, and apply effort to come back to a wholesome, attentive state.

4.  **The Benefits of Abandoning Hindrances:**
    Using similes from the suttas, Dhammarato describes the relief of freedom from hindrances as akin to:
    *   Recovering from sickness
    *   Being released from prison
    *   Completing a burdensome job
    *   Being freed from debt
    *   Safely completing a dangerous desert journey
    The result is ease, happiness, and a life free from self-created problems.

5.  **The Method: Right Practice**
    *   The essence of practice is **continuous investigation** (right view) and **remembering to pay attention** (right effort).
    *   This skill is developed through repetition in all activities, creating a positive feedback loop: paying attention externally improves internal awareness, and vice-versa.
    *   Tools like note-taking are "training wheels"; the ultimate goal is to develop the innate ability to sustain attention and memory without crutches.

### **Conclusion:**
The talk is a forceful and encouraging call to action. The hindrances are not abstract concepts but the direct causes of distraction and suffering. The solution is to cultivate the determination to "come out of the hindrances" in every moment—while listening, reading, conversing, and especially while observing the mind—leading to a life of ease, clarity, and freedom.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors** and references a few **stories** to explain the Five Hindrances.

### **Key Metaphors:**

1.  **The "Water" Metaphors (from the Samyutta Nikaya):** Each hindrance is compared to a different state of water that obscures clear vision.
    *   **Sensual Desire:** Water colored with dye (like lilac or cinnamon) — you focus on the pleasing color/scent, not what's beneath.
    *   **Ill-will/Anger:** Water that is boiling, hot, or smoky — agitation and heat prevent clear seeing.
    *   **Sloth & Torpor:** Water covered with algae or water plants — a dull, suffocating cover that blocks vision and oxygen.
    *   **Restlessness & Worry:** Water churned by the wind — stirred up, agitated, and unsettled.
    *   **Doubt:** Water that is muddy or turbid — clouded and unclear, you can't see through it.

2.  **The "School/Classroom" Metaphor:** This is the primary extended metaphor.
    *   **Paying attention in class** = Right Effort, leading to learning (skill/knowledge).
    *   **Not paying attention** = Being under the influence of a hindrance.
        *   Looking at classmates (sensual desire).
        *   Thinking about a bully (ill-will).
        *   Being bored, falling asleep (sloth & torpor).
        *   Worrying about grades or not doing homework (restlessness/worry).
        *   Doubting the teacher or the material (doubt).

3.  **The "Relief from Burden" Metaphors (from Sutta 39):** These illustrate the benefit of being free from hindrances. Each is a state of bondage or difficulty, and the joy is in release.
    *   **Recovering from sickness** and leaving the hospital.
    *   **Being released from prison.**
    *   **Being freed from slavery** or servitude.
    *   **Getting out of debt.**
    *   **Completing a dangerous journey** through a desert and arriving safely home.

4.  **Other Practical Metaphors:**
    *   **Reading a book/article:** The mind wanders off (into a hindrance) while the eyes keep moving down the page.
    *   **Conversation:** People don't listen; they just plan their next response while the other talks (a sign of hindrances at work).
    *   **Training wheels on a bicycle:** Taking notes can be a beginner's "crutch" to aid focus, but the goal is to ride without them (to pay attention directly and remember).

### **Stories & Anecdotes:**

1.  **The Einstein-Bohr Debate:** Briefly referenced to make a point about knowledge and doubt. The story of their disagreement over quantum physics ("spooky action at a distance") is used to show that doubt can have value if it leads to investigation, but also that knowledge (the teacher's lesson) is often "already loaded on the ship" — it's not being made up on the spot.
2.  **Personal Anecdote with "Tam":** The speaker shares how he interacts with his partner with generosity, focusing on what he can *give* her (like reassurance about a rental issue) rather than what he can get. This is offered as an antidote to the hindrances that ruin relationships (like ill-will or sensual desire).
3.  **Listener's Anecdote (RJ):** A participant shares his real-world experience of tracking his distractions during a work session, finding he lost focus every three minutes. This serves as a concrete, modern example of the hindrances in action.

### **Overall Narrative Arc:**
The talk itself follows a **story-like structure** moving through increasingly personal contexts:
1.  **School** (a relatable, external example).
2.  **Reading** (a more individual activity).
3.  **Conversation & Relationships** (interpersonal dynamics).
4.  **Meditation/Mindfulness** (the internal, fundamental practice).
This progression shows how the hindrances operate from broad life situations down to the core of one's own mind, arguing that **"the only real work you'll ever have is to pay attention."**
