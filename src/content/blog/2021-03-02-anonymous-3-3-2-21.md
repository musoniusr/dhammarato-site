### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So you were saying that you have seen a video that was done by a well-known famous monk, and that basically what he was saying was, is that forget concentration, that you need to develop wisdom instead. Is that basically what you're hearing?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, and it's like the focus was give up concentration. Okay, you have to give it up.

**Speaker A:** Um, well, let me ask you this question as a start-off. Do you think that everybody who uses the word concentration, everyone all together, all of us, understand what the word means and that everybody's using the same word the same way every time?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no, people have different understandings of what concentration is because there is the right concentration and— All right.

**Speaker A:** So let's— Okay, so let's not get too hung up on a word, but rather look at what he's talking about because he may be talking about a kind of concentration that is in fact not as beneficial as wisdom. And yet you're thinking about a kind of concentration that is extraordinarily valuable.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:DHAMMARATO] Yeah.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:BHIKKU] Okay. If we can understand that, then let's go through and define concentration in its various uses. And to start off that, I will say occasionally I use the word,

**Speaker B:** okay,

**Speaker A:** in the sense that today we're using it, okay. But there is something to it, um, in the sense of one person can say, uh, concentration is merely paying attention. In a way of someone just watching, like for instance, watching television. That's a form of concentration, it's paying attention, that people are not getting distracted from it. And then there's a different kind of concentration that's really, really, let us say, so focused that nothing else can get in. So that it is possible for someone to get so concentrated on some aspect of a television program that even though their house is burning down and the room is beginning to fill with smoke, still they don't catch on. Yeah, because they're not paying attention. They're too concentrated. All right, so perhaps what we're going for then is the understanding that maybe we need to pay attention or to watch some things and get used to and develop the skill to be able to focus and stay concentrated on something, and yet not discard other things that may be valuable and wholesome coming in. Just like having that smoke come into one's nose would be a very valuable thing to alert you to that something's amiss, something's wrong. That you want to, you know, take care of the situation. Yeah, and that's the way of looking at it, that that smoke from the fire that the guy watching television, because he's too concentrated, he doesn't pick it up. That's like saying that we can in fact practice meditation in a way that gets us so concentrated that when Dukkha comes by, we don't see it. And because we don't see it, we don't pick up on it.

**Speaker B:** But if we don't see Dukkha, how can we say that it's there? Is it there? Maybe it's not there. The mind is in something else. The Dukkha, where does it arise? It arises in the mind. So the focus of the concentration, when it is the mind, if there is Dukkha, there should All right, let us

**Speaker A:** say in the sense then of seeing the Dukkha coming. Yeah, maybe it's not there yet. Maybe the guy is so concentrated on whatever he's doing that a Zen master walks up behind him, raises that Zen stick, and in that moment of time there is no Dukkha. But as soon as that Zen stick comes down about 1 second later on his shoulder, hard, fast, loud, Now there's Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so we would say then that wisdom would be the ability to see the danger or to see Dukkha coming.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so we can see that in fact there's no reason to have two good things fighting with each other, that concentration and wisdom actually work together.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they can work together.

**Speaker A:** But it takes a certain amount of concentration to pay attention.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because usually the mind is just wandering about in everything. It doesn't pick up on anything. Dukkha arises and he is somewhere else. He is not paying attention. So when we bring the attention to the breath and to the mind, we can see the Dukkha. Saying that concentration, you have to give it up. You're walking on the air, you're not walking on any ground, solid ground. It's just wasting the time, really.

**Speaker A:** Yes, okay. Now what about this situation, going kind of real, and that is that someone is, let us say again, concentrating on the television, and that instead of having smoke in the air, They have anxiety that occasionally while they're watching television, they also have a random thought about they ought to do their homework. And so while they're watching television, a bit of anxiety builds up and they're still not aware of it because they're concentrating on television. So if they're not aware of that anxiety, does that mean that the anxiety is Dukkha or not Dukkha?

**Speaker B:** It's still Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** It's still Dukkha. Okay. All right. I just wanted to make that clear. Now let's go to the Eightfold Noble Path for just a moment, because you did mention that before we started the recorder.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's not a Sevenfold Noble Path, it's an Eightfold Noble Path. That concentration is— Ah, so

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] Let's talk about that Eightfold Noble Path, not in the way that most people see it or in the way that it's normally presented, but let's look at the Eightfold Noble Path in the way that the Buddha describes it in Sutta 117 in the Majjhima Nikaya. And in there, what he actually says was, Listen carefully, monks, because I'm about to teach you right noble unification of mind with its seven supports and requisites. Okay, that's how he approaches it. And that he doesn't really go too much into right unification of mind right then and there. But you can imagine that this translation of the Eightfold Noble Path, the Samma Arya Samatha, actually is pointing at a unification of mind, where all of the constituent components that are necessary come together to make a new system, and that the results of that system is something that's greater than the sum of the parts. An example of that is when all of the parts of an automobile come together, you have an automobile, and the result is that is transportation. And transportation is not there in the seat or the driving— or this, excuse me, the steering wheel or the motor or the tires, but the driving or the transportation is when all of those things come together, right? So this is what the Buddha means by the right unification of mind, is when all of the really important factors come together as a whole. An example of that would be like, uh, you, you've probably seen them in from time to time, the grandfather clocks, the great big clocks that they had 200 to 100 years ago with a big pendulum swing and all of that. You know what I'm talking about? Yeah, yeah, a grandfather clock. Okay, now there's two ways that we can Samadhi that clock. One of the ways that we can Samatha a clock like that is by putting it back together in the sense that all of the parts and, and pieces of it are there in place, making a unified whole so that the clock functions correctly, right? And there's another way we can concentrate that clock or give that clock Samadhi, and that is we can take a hammer to it and beat it into the smallest little thing that we can make.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:DHAMMARATO] Okay, so it's broken.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:BHIKKU] Then it's broken, that's right. So do you want a very concentrated clock or do you want a Samatha clock? Okay, this is, I think, is what this monk is pointing to, is that many, many, many people misunderstand what the Buddha would use with the word Samadhi. That Samadhi means bringing things together as a unification or a unified whole, and yet because that word has been translated into concentration, Many Westerners just see the word concentration and don't understand the underlying Pali behind it and what the word Samadhi actually means. And because of that, they get a misunderstanding of how to practice. And this monk is warning people about that. Do not spend your time trying to make the mind so concentrated that you can stop your thoughts. A lot of people try that, I did myself, or to try to make the mind so concentrated that it can get past life experiences and things like this. This is where a lot of Westerners go wrong, they're using actually their practice of concentration to get something out of that concentration.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right?

**Speaker A:** They're future-oriented. They'll say, "If I can get enough concentration, then I can blah blah."

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. I understand that. But this is like a wrong type of concentration. It's not the right one that leads, that the Buddha teaches and that leads to the fruits. But it is still a type of concentration. And yeah, you basically really described it really well.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Yes. So this is basically what we're talking about then is you're right, spot on. And that is that there is a wrong concentration and Westerners practice that wrong kind of concentration quite often. I'm not saying everybody does it. Obviously not everybody. Does it. So there's no reason to be superlative about it. But it is common when people want Jhana, when they want past life experiences, when they want something out of meditation, then they work really hard at it. They go really, really deep into it. Now let's look at it as an example of a pictorial example. Imagine for some reason that this hand that I've got here is what we're concentrating on, okay? And that the mind is normally like this, a little bit of— you can see it a little bit, but the mind is all over the place. In fact, mostly what happens is that the mind goes like this.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, now what I mean by that is that the mind sees the object and then thinks about it. That this is in fact how we often read a book. As we start reading the book, we can get an idea from the book, or reading a newspaper article, or a blog or something, and we get an idea in that first paragraph or something, and then we go off someplace and we don't stay on the reading. And so basically, the training is going to be for us to spend more time just paying attention to or looking at the object or having mind moments about the object rather than having mind moments all over the place.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's not as beneficial as when it's focused.

**Speaker A:** Right, and yet the kind of concentration that this monk is warning about is the kind of concentration of this. You see what I mean? The concentration of trying to get into the object to affect the object, to to grasp the object, to cling to the object. That's another kind of concentration. In the beginning, look at the kind of concentration you see, I don't even touch the object, I just am looking at it or paying attention to it, and that's the kind of concentration that is the Samadhi that we're looking for, not the pushing on it or the poking at it.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] Yeah, but there will come at one point where the mind just wants to stay on the hand, it doesn't want to wander all around and wants to stay.

**Speaker A:** Ah, yeah, but here it's still this, but then it's very gentle.

**Speaker B:** Very gentle, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Very gentle.

**Speaker B:** The mind by itself is very gentle.

**Speaker A:** Right, just so gentle, everything is relaxed and everything is just paying attention, just watching what's going on, but most people when they think of concentration, they want to push. And that this monk is warning them about that, to not push.

**Speaker B:** Well, maybe, I don't know what he's talking about, but to me concentration is really important. And I recall somewhere— Samma, Arya, Samatha

**Speaker A:** is important, and you're using that in the word of concentration. So we should have then always used the word, then the term, right noble concentration. Yeah, as opposed to the meditator's concentration.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay. I just want to say that I recall somewhere the Buddha said when someone is young He either develops wisdom, he can develop wisdom and virtue, and so he doesn't waste his years. Or he can develop wealth, he can work and he can develop money and have something in the world, and he doesn't waste his time basically. Or he can just do anything and maybe enjoy pleasures or whatever he does, and he gains nothing. And I think this can apply also to some level to concentration. At the top there is the right concentration. When someone develops concentration and he gets the Arya concentration and he understands the Dhamma, or he can put his concentration in something in the world and he can get something in the world. So some sort of power, or he just can let his mind wander about. Let go of the concentration and just pray for wisdom to appear and it will not appear by itself and he just waits his time. So either way concentration is better.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely, so what you could say is in that analogy of the Buddha that one person in fact can bring all of that to meditation in the sense of gaining wealth, By concentrating, or, and that's a way of practice, is working too hard and expecting some result. And in fact, maybe your people don't get as wealthy as they want to be, but they're striving for the wealth. And in fact, that happens in the real world. When people get wealthy, they still don't have enough wealth. They want more. Yeah, okay. And then the other side of it, the ones who are just out after the sensual pleasures or the sensual desires, they're the ones that are not putting in any effort at all, no right effort. And for that reason, they have to then chase their sensual pleasures, because the sensual pleasures are not coming by themselves.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so if we can think of this middle path then, is just the right amount of effort, to put the right effort in so that we can bring the mind into a really great state without trying to force it into that, that there is in fact no real work to do, the working is working too hard, that right effort is not work, right effort is just doing it. And you just do it and then there you are, as opposed to striving and struggling and working and whatever after some result or some reward that you don't have yet. That if you take the right effort, then you get the reward immediately. Ah yeah, I don't have to think about that. I see you, Mara. Okay, so I think I've told you this story before, but this is the story also of the— or the analogy or the metaphor of— imagine that you're standing in the road and that a big lorry, a big truck, is bearing right down on you coming down that road. And there's three things that we can do about it. One is we can just stand there and let the thing run over us. Now in that regard, whether you saw the truck coming or not doesn't mean anything because you didn't do anything. That in fact, uh, you have an extra level of fear, and that is the fear of watching the truck hit you and then have the truck hit you. And so you got both. If you didn't see it coming, then all you got to deal with is getting hit. And so seeing it coming, being mindful, didn't help very much. Not much help, not much mindfulness. Okay, so the next one is this kind of concentration that we're talking about is like Popeye trying to stop that truck. Uh-huh, I see that truck coming, I'm going to stand right here and I'm going to force it to stop. Guess what? He gets run over too. And so both of them wind up being disappointed. But the right effort would be noble Samadhi, would be just to merely stand out of the way, to get out of the road, just to move a little bit, to take the effort to move out of the way of that stuff. To recognize it. Aha, I see you, Mara. And then just note it well and let it pass. In fact, you might want to just give it a little shove to help it on. And we take and change what's in the mind. Okay, so in that regard, what that monk said was actually correct, but the way you heard it was incorrect, because it actually takes a kind of wisdom— excuse me, yeah, it does— it takes a kind of wisdom to get the right kind of concentration, and it takes the right kind of concentration to gain wisdom. They're like two wings of a dove. They also talk about that in the sense of Vipassana, Samatha. Which is exactly what we're talking about here. And what he's doing is he's saying, "Make sure that you pay enough attention to the Vipassana without going off into the Samatha too deeply." And I'm saying, "No, going into Samatha at all, 100%, is the wrong way to go. Don't do this concentration stuff." That that's wrong effort, you're not going to get any advantage out of it at all that way. That in fact, the only way to get that turkey to fly, is with both wings.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's like walking with two legs. You cannot cut off a leg, my leg, you tell me, no, you don't need concentration, tell me walk, or, you know, cut off, be like discernment, and you tell me you can walk. You can't. People walk on two legs. Let me walk on my two legs.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. So you're walking on two legs and my two wings of a bird is exactly you know, two analogies of exactly the same thing, that it takes both. It takes both Vipassana and Samatha, and

**Speaker B:** that they are both qualities of the mind, really. Samatha and Vipassana, they're both qualities of the mind. They're not just work. Okay, I'm going to do Vipassana now and I'm gonna go away. And something that he mentioned is that he mentioned that he said that other religions there are other religions that only teach Samatha and calming the mind, and that the Buddha's religion, maybe he means that it came with Vipassana, that it's something new. And I don't think so, because for example, in the Judeo-Christian religions, we have that sense that there's someone watching over you, that you have to be that you have to have an ethical conduct, that there's going to be heaven and hell, and your actions will determine where you go. So it's kind of a Vipassana, really, it's kind of a Vipassana teaching. It's that quality of mind that you watch over your mind and your actions. So no, the Vipassana and Samatha teachings, they were like a little bit spread over other religions, they have a little bit of that too. It's not only calming the mind.

**Speaker A:** And yet Jesus spent 40 days in the wilderness and Muhammad frequented going to a cave outside of Mecca.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's true.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so that means that both of them were having some sort of combination of Samatha, Vipassana. And yet, if you look at the actual teachings of Jesus, you can see that he actually tried to teach both and was a failure at teaching both. And that the one can be seen in the parables, the wisdom part, and also the wisdom and the value of compassion and taking care of the poor. The poor, and all of that kind of stuff. And Islam has that, too, except that Islam has it in the sense of practicing it narrowly. But Christianity does that, too, in the sense of they would rather take care of someone and convert them to Christianity so that they're taking care of a Christian. And so they have that quality of trying to control as well as doing the teaching. But the teaching for both Christianity and Islam is more, let us say, focused on the Vipassana, and yet without any Samatha at all. The people are incapable of doing the very Vipassana that they harp on. Isn't that interesting? So again, it's back to, we've got to do both.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they're both like two qualities of the mind, the calmness and the investigation. If you're not calm, for example, someone who is angry, he cannot understand or do work properly because he's angry. The state of mind is in such turmoil that he does not become sensitive to the Dukkha, and he doesn't gain anything. And also, if the mind is a little bit calm by itself and there is no investigation, he's not improving, it's not going anywhere. So these two qualities of the mind, they're both needed. If someone tells me you don't need this one, you just need one of them, that's so wrong. It's not the right practice.

**Speaker A:** Let's use the example of a camera for a moment. And you probably have seen pictures of, photos of very ancient cameras, the cameras that they had 100 years ago, the film that they used was not as good as the film that eventually got developed. In fact, one of the improvements or development of photography over the last 100 years or so has been in the speed of the development, so that now with digital we've got instant turnaround, but also it has to do with the speed of the lens. Now here's what I'm talking about. In the old days, old cameras had to be set on a tripod, that before handheld cameras could be useful, they had to get them up to a speed so that the jerkiness of one's own hands did not interfere in the picture. But if you've got to leave the camera lens open for half a second or so, then if you don't have that camera on a tripod, it's going to give you a blurry image. You get what I'm talking about? Yeah. Okay, so the quality then of photography has to do with the speed of the film. And naturally, in the old days when we had 100 film, that was the cheaper film, and then we could buy more expensive film, 400 film, which would be faster. And then we'd even have a very, very high-speed film, would be the 1600. So what we're talking about is that the mind is very much like that, that our training is such that our Vipassana, or our ability to take shots or to see what's going on, is interrupted by the shakiness of the mind, especially when we have— it takes time to figure things out when we're slow in the beginning. And so what we want is we want to start off with working on stability so that we can at least take a few good shots with a very slow camera. Okay. And then as we progress in our practice, Then what we want to do is to speed up that process so that the Samatha, or the stability of the camera, is not so important, so that eventually we can actually get up off of the cushion and go practice Anapanasati out in the world, where things are moving pretty fast.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:DHAMMARATO] Yeah, that is definitely more difficult.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so in fact you could say that for the way that I'm describing it, Samatha would come first and then Vipassana, but that's not exactly what the Buddha said. In fact, in one of the sutras that I know of, he says to do it like this: that if you have Anapanasati, then you should develop Samatha, which means that even if you could see what's going on, you need to develop the Samatha so you can speed things up and see things earlier in the process of Paticcasamuppada. And if you have Samadhi without Vipassana, then you should develop Vipassana. And if you do not have either Vipassana or Samatha, then you should develop them both together. Now whether or not that word, how strong that word together is, I'm not sure, because everybody in our conversational world here starts off with very little Vipassana and very little Samatha. And that the way that we practice Anapanasati is basically working them together, that the Eightfold Noble Path that we mentioned does have this quality. Let's look at the way that that Sutta and go back and visit it for a moment. And that is that the Right Noble Samadhi or the Right Noble Concentration that we need is developed with the supports and requisites that it has. And one of the supports and requisites that you did mention was that We may not be able to figure out wisdom, but sometimes people can dump it right on us, just give us a load of it. And what that means is that a few rules that we are taught are actually quite valuable, that some wisdom is really easy to pick up. Right speech, right action, right livelihood should be part of the mix along, but eventually, as I say, that when the mind is noble and that the mind is unified, then the right behavior and the right speech are quite natural. That in fact, the correct way of looking at it is that one can only have right speech when in that instant his mind is noble, and when the next minute, when his mind is not noble, that's when he's going to let it go. So how long can he keep the mind noble? Because if he keeps the mind noble, he can restrain himself.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there would be no reason to speak wrong speech.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so the real issue though is not Sila, because Sila can be seen as the result of that noble mind, even though the person will go in and out of noble mind and in and out of noble right speech, that when the mind is noble, they will in fact have right speech. So, let's go back to the training wheels then. The training is right view, right Sati, right effort, and right attitude. And when we bring those four things together, those four things together then are the condition of the unification of mind. In other words, the mind is unified when we do in fact see things correctly, investigate have that right attitude, and that right attitude is also an attitude of joy and an attitude of relaxation. So, the Eightfold Noble Path, the right attitude and the right effort to get there and the right Sati to remember to do that, and the right investigation along the way to get there is what brings us to that unification of mind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, which is really important. Which is really important. Just saying that that unification of mind is really important. It's not something that we can say, bring it to the unification of mind, and we can just pass by and go to something else. It's really important. We need it. It's something that leads to the insights.

**Speaker A:** It is the path.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it is the path.

**Speaker A:** And that's why the Buddha taught it that way, is the right unification of mind with its supports and requisites. So we have to see the other factors as supports for this unification of mind, which then puts the unification of mind as that mind then which is now free from suffering and fulfilling all of the rest of the Eightfold Noble Path— excuse me, the Four Noble Truths, in the sense of can see Dukkha, understand the cause of it, and use the path to come out of it, and now the mind is free of it. Only a unified mind then, according to what we're talking about, could be in that Third Noble Truth, completely free from suffering. Though it's time, it's possible, quite easy in fact, for many people to have a bit of unification of mind, or have a complete unification of mind for short periods of time throughout the day. That we do have good moments. Life is not 100% shit. If it was, everybody would be actually looking for some pill to take. The fact is that some parts of life are actually enjoyable.

**Speaker B:** And that's how we keep on living.

**Speaker A:** The question is, why can't we make much more of our time enjoyable? Why do we have to spend so much of the day in misery and only a small part of time in great joy and relaxation?

**Speaker B:** That nurturing that you told me about, to nurture the happiness that comes from inside.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. And a lot of people don't like it when I use the word manufacture, but how else are you going to— I mean, we can use conjure if they like magic, we can say we can conjure up our joy, we manufacture joy, we create joy, we encourage joy to arise, and we have the kind of wholesome thoughts that will allow that joy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and it helps on walking the path, really. I don't understand why some people have trouble with this, that tell you, "No, don't do that, it's bad." I mean, it helps on the path. If the mind is not having some pleasant feeling, it will go somewhere else. It will go to sensual pleasures, to get his happiness.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:DHAMMARATO] I don't know about all countries, but I do know that in the Western way of looking at it, because of the influence from Christianity, that and the oppression of both the religion and the governments in prior centuries, The idea then is that salvation comes through suffering. If you suffer enough, then something or someone will have pity upon you and give some mercy to you, if you suffer enough. Now you can see that in fact even in meditation, when the students have the idea that, oh, and I've seen some people actually write it on Reddit and advertise it, advertise it, "Oh, I've done 100,000 hours of meditation," as if that meant something. That the Kamma machine is going to come in and make them happy because they spent 100,000 hours now of misery and suffering and they suffered enough, now they can be happy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's when the moment when someone realized that you don't have to suffer, that you have the choice to be happy, you don't have to suffer, that's when it comes.

**Speaker A:** Got it, okay. So let's look at those practices that work so hard that they get themselves into a really bad state of suffering. It could be so bad, a state of despair so bad, it could be called a dark night of the soul. Now there's only two possibilities, and that is for the person to come out of that dark night of the soul, or they're going to die in it. Those are the two possibilities. I can't think of either anything other than that. And I can tell you that some people, especially Christians that we know, die in it. Mother Teresa, after they posthumously published her memoirs, it was quite evident that she was in a really deep dark night of the soul. With the kind of words like, 'Why has thou forsaken me?' That God didn't answer her prayers, okay? And she really suffered because she really wanted to make contact with Jesus. And Jesus says, 'Not you, lady.' Yeah, okay. But meditators can do that too. They can get themselves into this ferocious state that's so deep that they can finally see the Dukkha and they can wake up out of it. And they can come out of that state with the idea that, "Hey, if I can handle that dark night of the soul I just put myself through, I can handle anything." And now they start practicing correctly.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] Yeah, and if someone is not sensitive enough to see it, it's just wasting the time. It's so necessary that when someone tells me, "You don't need to do concentration," I just cannot trust that person, because it's really necessary to see the Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] Well, you have to understand, he may be using a different word than you are, or he's using the word differently rather, is a better way of saying it, because there's various levels of concentration. All concentration is not the same thing. Here's an example of that. There is frozen concentrated orange juice, I use that example. I don't know if there's other frozen concentrates, but orange juice is very common. And if it gets concentrated enough, it's into a powder form that they call Tang as a product that's sold. Now, as far as I know, nobody eats Tang. And as far as I know, no one eats frozen concentrated orange juice. Yeah, it has— what almost everyone does is put a necessary ingredient back into it. So then the Tang or the frozen concentrated orange juice are not Samadhi, they're not complete. And in that regard of what I just said, then Samatha and concentration are exact opposites. Where we think of concentrate means to take all of the unnecessary ingredients out, but Samatha is meaning make sure that you've got all the necessary ingredients in.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I really get it because there are different misunderstandings about it. But I think it's like a general theme in nowadays society. Like we see on Facebook, on Instagram, all those social media platforms, they shorten the attention spans, the media, the advertisements, they want to feed your greed. They don't want you to be concentrated, they don't want you to be grounded, to be aware of what's happening. Nobody wants you to be aware. So someone tells me, yeah, someone tells me, go with whatever happens to the mind, reactive, having a reactive mind, all that sort of stuff. It's just the wrong way to go, really. So it's better to feel grounded, to be aware of things and not react to them. So yeah, it's like a general theme in nowadays society. Nobody wants you to have a strong concentration. Nobody wants you to have a strong mind, because if you do have, you will be led, the church can lie to you, anyone can lie to you with their religions, and you don't know truth. From false.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] That's right, that it takes a bit of time to put two and two together, is a way of saying it. And so we're talking about a kind of concentration then, that is not strongly working really hard on something, but rather has a quality of steadiness to it. In other words, taking the time to put 2 and 2 together to come up with 4. And then you put 2 and 2 together again several times, and you keep looking. You get 4 boxes, and you put 2 of them here, and you rig around until you actually proved yourself beyond a shadow of a doubt that 2 2 4. And that takes a bit of time. So if they can keep you scatterbrained then they can sometimes put 2 and 2 is equal to 3 and you might miss it. Then 2 and 2 is 5 and you might miss it. And now they can lie to you because you're not paying attention. You're not concentrated. You're not focused on it or staying on the object. If you stay on it, They don't want that. They don't want you to stay on the object because then they can't lie to you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly. Do you know, Dhammarato, when that thing started? I know that in the Vishuddhimarga, I think there is a mention of the dry Vipassana, Arahants and something like that, that Arahants that don't do Samatha with dry Vipassana. I mean, when did it start in Buddhism exactly? That notion that you just need to do Vipassana and that's it, like when did it start, how did it happen?

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:DHAMMARATO] I don't know, but I think that in the time of the Buddha and with the Buddha, because of the way some of the suttas are written and whatnot, that the Buddha was a pretty happy dude and that joy was a major part of his teaching It's part of the Eightfold Noble Path, it's part of the Seven Factors of Enlightenment, it's part of the Anapanasati practice, it is part of the two kinds of thought and all kinds of stuff, to be joyful, to be happy. But somehow over 2,500 years, that's been kind of wrung out of it. The joy that the Buddha teach is somehow wrung out of it, almost as if you could say the same thing with Christianity, because they talk about the Gospel. The Gospel is good news, right? The teaching of Jesus should be very liberating and very joyful, and yet here they are, "How much can we make you suffer?" And so, I would say that the same kind of thing that's happened to Christianity has happened to Buddhism, too, is that the real joy the real value of the religion had been wrung right out of it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, just to mention it, I've been reading some old gospels of the Christians. I think they found it in the 20th century with the Anagami Library. They're like very, very old gospels of the first centuries of Jesus. So they were not really changed a lot, and it's really amazing what they talk about. I think one of them is the Gospel of Saint Thomas or something. But yeah, he talks about the Kingdom of God and like God, which is inside. Yeah, here it is. Yeah, here it is. Yeah, here it is.

**Speaker A:** He talks about good stuff, really. Marvelous

**Speaker B:** stuff too. Yes, some of those old Gospels that somehow they were stuck in history and they just recently found it, they were not changed too much and they speak some

**Speaker A:** interesting stuff. Well, you kind of answered the question then. Why by the time the Vasudhi Marga comes by that we're talking about dry. I don't even know about dry, but I do know that if people are practicing incorrectly, then they are dry. They're working too hard or not working hard enough. So we need that— perhaps the best way to talk about it is that sweet spot. The middle path. And that middle path is very, very comfortable, very nice, not too hot, not too cold, just comfortable, not too big, not too small, just right. That's why we call it the middle path, and the Buddha was spot on. That was the very first thing he ever taught. In the Dhamma Chakrapavanta Sutta, in the first talk that he had, the first part of the dialogue was to talk about the middle path. And so we need to learn to practice the middle path in everything. Middle path in concentration, middle path in joy, middle path in wisdom, all of it. And when we get it all tuned together, fine-tuned together, now we have a unified mind. But if we are at one of the extremes or the other, then we look at it as good and bad. Oh, this extreme here is better than that extreme

**Speaker B:** over there. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's true. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, I just want to ask you about this stuff because it's really, disturbing when I hear that something which is in the Eightfold Noble Path, that something that the Buddha did teach, and someone tells you to give it up, you don't need it. It just, yeah, it just bothered me for a little bit.

**Speaker A:** So, well, don't let it bug you because we have spent now an hour talking about the fact that concentrated is one word that has many different values and uses, and that he was right in warning the students against the wrong kind of concentration, the Samatha only, if you want to call it that way, or cutting off one leg.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there are some teachings, I think in the Vishuddhimarga, that they teach concentration on a candle and concentration on— they were like Hindu meditations that got their way in Buddhism, really.

**Speaker A:** You would expect that to happen. I'll tell you another place that it happened. Jewish culture and Greek culture got mixed into Christianity Arab culture got mixed in, right? And Arab culture got mixed into the teachings of Muhammad, and Hindu culture got mixed in with the teachings of the Buddha. The answer— the question is, why did that happen? The answer is, is that, well, where did Buddha get his people? When they came to him, they came to him through all of their bullshit, so they carried it in with them. And there was a time in— it was a period of time that lasted from about 300 BC to about 250 BC. During that time, King Ashoka, or Emperor Ashoka, had come to power and had become Buddhist and was doing all of the really good things that he was doing, like building roads and putting up markers and actually putting inscriptions and stone things up for the various places. In fact, he actually put one up for Lumbini that wasn't discovered until 1986. That before 1986, the Buddhists really didn't even know where the Buddha was born until they dug up Lumbini pillar that Ahsoka had put down. And they trusted that Ahsoka must know where Buddha was born. So these are the kinds of things that he did, but he also supported the monks with robes and bowls and medicines and all kinds of stuff, as well as housing and accommodation. He built monasteries. For this reason, there was a great influx at that time with all of the various mendicants and religious people from all over the place. Came to Rajgiri to become ordained as Buddhist monks so that they could get all of the benefits of being a Buddhist monk from the king. And they overwhelmed the faculty of old monks who really knew the teachings of the Buddha. This is the place where too much concentration, too much magic, too much this, that, and the other thing came into the teachings of the Buddha, from other religions brought in by insiders. And so they taught each other because there wasn't enough faculty. It would be like a university that, let us say they had 10,000 students, and the faculty of 500 could manage 10,000 students. But all of a sudden, the state changed their laws or whatever, and now, whomp, all of a sudden that university has 200,000 students. They're running all over each other, and every class has got too many students in it, and the teachers are just not enough to go around. They're overwhelmed with all these ignorant students who don't have a clue about what's going on, and the students want to learn, and so they set up their own show. That's exactly what happened in the time of the Buddha. The monks who were new and didn't know what was really going on, they set up their own show. They were jealous of the monks who really did know what was

**Speaker B:** going on.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. All right, so this is how that stuff happens. It happened in a very specialized kind of way within Buddhism, but you can see that it happens to all the religions. The very, very best part of the religions is often suppressed, and that the worst part of the religion is exalted. In Christianity, the suffering of Jesus is exalted, so the Christians, they just really suffer. OK, to where Muhammad was a champion, he was a warrior, and so now that's kind of overemphasized Islam. Yeah, that's true. So this is how it kind of goes. Every religion, uh, goes astray in his own unique way, but they always keep going to the same place wrongly, and that is into too much magic, too much concentration, too much of this and that and the

**Speaker B:** other thing. Yeah, instead of taking this little path Yeah, I think nowadays it's going the other way, where society tells you, you don't need concentration, just go with whatever you want, let your desires rule you.

**Speaker A:** I know, I bet some students can listen to what I would have to say and say, oh, Dhammarato says don't do concentration, because I keep talking about the word concentration in English is not the same as the word Samatha

**Speaker B:** in Pali. Yeah, I think that people have some reserves on talking about some words like concentration, like happiness. Like people are afraid to be happy, but it's like the true meaning of happiness, just that well-being. If you understand like the true happiness is the peace, the well-being, the true health, you're not afraid of the word happiness anymore. The same way when someone understands what the word concentration means. He's not afraid of concentration, he understands that it's a good thing, that it's part of the path, and that's it. So we don't reject happiness, I mean, the search is to find that true well-being. And in the same way, we should not be afraid of concentration. If that's the thing, we should understand what the true concentration is, what does it mean, what is it about. And just do it, and that's it, right? I mean, being afraid will not lead anywhere. When someone says don't be afraid,

**Speaker A:** no, just— that's correct, that's absolutely correct. Well, I hope that you feel better now about what you heard the monk say, that he was talking a little bit about different kind of concentration, I think, than what you had heard him talk about. But I bet if you had a conversation with him, you and he personally, he would, and you would come to the agreement that yeah, that there's no reason to cut off one leg and hop around, that a bird can't fly with just one wing. Yeah. Yes, but it

**Speaker B:** takes both. Yeah. Oh yeah, thanks, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. All right. Well, I'm really glad to see you again. We'll see you again, hmm? Okay.

**Speaker B:** All right. See you next time.

**Speaker A:** See you. Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, primarily between **Dhammarato** (Speaker A) and a **Sangha friend** (Speaker B), centers on a debate sparked by a famous monk's teaching to "forget concentration" and focus only on wisdom. The discussion clarifies the meaning of "concentration" (*samādhi*) in the Buddhist path.

### **Core Summary:**

The talk is a nuanced exploration of **Right Concentration** (*sammā samādhi*) as an essential part of the Noble Eightfold Path, distinguishing it from misguided or "wrong" types of concentration that some practitioners may pursue.

**Key Points:**

1.  **The Problem of Terminology:** The discussion begins by acknowledging that the word "concentration" is used in many ways. The famous monk was likely warning against a **misunderstood, forced, and narrow concentration**—like being so absorbed in TV you miss your house burning down. This type leads to ignoring *dukkha* (suffering) rather than understanding it.

2.  **Right Concentration vs. Wrong Concentration:**
    *   **Wrong Concentration:** Is grasping, forceful, and future-oriented (e.g., striving for jhāna or psychic powers as a goal in itself). It's compared to beating a clock with a hammer—destroying its function in the name of focusing it.
    *   **Right Concentration (*Sammā Samādhi*):** Is part of the **"right unification of mind,"** a gentle, steady, and relaxed awareness that unifies all factors of the path. It's like a well-assembled clock that functions harmoniously. It is characterized by **paying attention without pushing or clinging**.

3.  **Wisdom and Concentration are Interdependent:** The central conclusion is that **samatha** (tranquility/concentration) and **vipassanā** (insight/wisdom) are like **two wings of a bird or two legs for walking**—both are absolutely necessary. Concentration provides the stable, calm "camera" needed for wisdom to take a clear "picture" of reality. Wisdom guides concentration to be mindful of *dukkha* rather than oblivious to it.

4.  **The Role of Joy and the Middle Path:** The speakers critique approaches that wring **joy** (*pīti/sukha*) out of practice, linking it to a misguided "salvation through suffering" mindset. The Buddha's Middle Path includes cultivating wholesome joy and relaxation, which nourishes the path and prevents the mind from seeking happiness in unskillful places.

5.  **Historical Corruption of the Teachings:** They briefly discuss how authentic teachings can become diluted over time. In Buddhism, this happened when an influx of new monastics after King Ashoka introduced non-Buddhist meditation techniques (e.g., concentration on a candle) and an overemphasis on dry striving, overshadowing the balanced, joyful path.

### **Conclusion:**

The talk reassures the concerned student that the famous monk was likely warning against a **distorted, extreme form of concentration**, not the **Right Concentration** of the Noble Eightfold Path. The true path requires a balanced, unified mind where calm stability (*samatha*) and investigative insight (*vipassanā*) support each other on a joyful, middle-way journey toward the end of suffering.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors, analogies, and stories** to explain the relationship between concentration (*samādhi*) and wisdom (*paññā*), and to warn against misunderstanding "concentration." Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **Key Metaphors & Stories**

1. **The Person Watching TV While the House Burns**
   * **What it illustrates:** A person so intensely concentrated on a TV show that they don’t notice smoke filling the room—a warning against a type of concentration that blinds you to important signals (like *dukkha* or suffering).
   * **Purpose:** To distinguish between harmful concentration (narrow, oblivious) and beneficial attention (aware, inclusive).

2. **The Grandfather Clock**
   * **Two ways to “concentrate” the clock:**
     1. Assemble all parts so it works harmoniously as a unified whole (*right samādhi*).
     2. Smash it with a hammer into a compact lump (“concentrated” but destroyed).
   * **Purpose:** To explain the Pali term *samādhi* as “unification” or “bringing together” (like a functioning system) vs. the Western idea of “concentration” as forceful narrowing.

3. **Walking on Two Legs / A Bird with Two Wings**
   * **What it illustrates:** Concentration and wisdom are both necessary, like two legs for walking or two wings for flying. You can’t discard one and expect progress.
   * **Purpose:** To argue against teachings that say to “give up concentration”—both factors support each other on the path.

4. **Popeye Trying to Stop a Truck**
   * **Three responses to a truck bearing down on you:**
     1. Do nothing (get run over).
     2. Like Popeye, try to forcefully stop it with muscle (still get run over—representing wrong effort/forced concentration).
     3. Simply step aside (right effort—mindful, wise, effortless action).
   * **Purpose:** To depict “right effort” and “right concentration” as intelligent, responsive, and non-forced, in contrast to striving or brute-force meditation.

5. **The Camera and Tripod**
   * **What it illustrates:** Early photography needed a tripod (stability) to compensate for slow film and shaky hands. As film speed improved, handheld shots became possible.
   * **Purpose:** To explain how *samatha* (calm/stability) supports *vipassanā* (insight). Initially, you need stability to see clearly; with practice, insight can happen faster even in dynamic situations.

6. **Frozen Orange Juice Concentrate vs. Complete Juice**
   * **What it illustrates:** Concentrated orange juice (powder or frozen) is not the complete, drinkable product—you must add back what’s missing (water).
   * **Purpose:** To highlight how Western “concentration” often means *removing* elements (narrowing focus), while *samādhi* means *including* all necessary factors for a unified, wholesome mind.

7. **University Overwhelmed by Students**
   * **Story:** After King Ashoka’s support, many non-Buddhist ascetics ordain as monks for material gain, overwhelming the genuine teachers. They start teaching their own methods (like Hindu-style concentration), diluting the Buddha’s teachings.
   * **Purpose:** To give a historical analogy for how misinterpretations (like overemphasis on forced concentration) entered Buddhism.

---

### **Recurring Themes in the Imagery**
* **Right Concentration vs. Wrong Concentration:** Often contrasted as *unified, relaxed, aware* vs. *forced, narrow, oblivious*.
* **Middle Path:** The “sweet spot”—not too tight, not too loose—like a well-tuned system.
* **System/Unification:** *Samādhi* as a harmonious system (clock, automobile) where all parts work together.
* **Everyday Technology:** Using TV, clocks, cars, cameras, and orange juice to make abstract meditation concepts relatable.

These metaphors collectively clarify that the criticized “concentration” is a **forceful, narrow, goal-oriented striving** that dulls awareness, while true *samādhi* is a **relaxed, unified, inclusive awareness** that works synergistically with wisdom.
