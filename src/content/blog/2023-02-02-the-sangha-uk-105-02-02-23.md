### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, the blue button is pressed. Hello everyone. Hello friends. So we're doing the Wednesday Sangha call. And yeah, Scott's not with us today. He's off snowboarding. So we're just going to have a fun little chat, a little bit freeform, probably not going to go into suttas so much today. But I was thinking about talking a little bit about gladdening the mind. Step 10 of Anapanasati. But the cool thing with it is we don't have to work through like all the steps in sequential order. We can just come on back to gladdening the mind, which is a key ingredient which is sometimes missing. So yeah, does anybody out there have any thoughts on gladdening the mind or any pointers on how one might do that? I know, Alex, I think a great pointer is the smiling, actually. And what's beautiful with that— I heard in one of Dhammarato's talks, he brought up— or I think one of his students brought up the smiling of the mind for like gladdening the mind. But what's kind of interesting with that is like we can actually get almost the physical component with it as well, like by bringing in the smile, right? That helps to gladden the mind, but there's a physical component to it. So it's kind of like wonderful. I think that does actually have some benefits. Smiling, gladdening.

**Speaker B:** One of the ways that I've heard it talked about recently, I'm listening to an audiobook while I go about, I do some food deliveries and such, and I let the little audiobook play and listen to it, kind of like another way to entertain the mind with Dhamma. And one of the things I'm finding in this book, Fast Thinking Thinking, slow thinking is this individual, they talk about the physiological connection between the mind and the body being the brain. And when we talk about it in this way, and we see evidence of things like when you prime someone, say, for example, you're going to present them with some information and you— where's the pencil at?

**Speaker A:** Here we go.

**Speaker B:** So here we have a pencil and we put it in the mouth even. What they find is just that simple movement gladdens the mind, you know, because it's just such a quick connection, such a way to— and that when we hold it like this, all of a sudden we get a little frown, you know. And so they find that priming individuals in this way physiologically, it helps the mind to respond positively to this flow of information that we have that's always coming and going, you know, and rising and passing and whatnot. And I love the idea of talking about gladdening the mind through the physical ways through the smile like we're talking about. And I love to hear others talk about it like that too. Like when we hear just even the pencil thing, it just makes me so happy to know that there's such a way, you know, it's always accessible for us, always there in each and every moment. And all it takes is just remembering to look and see, hey, which way am I holding the pencil right now?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. So there's that Sati, that like waking up to it. And seeing. And that's the interesting thing too, like that can be a wonderful bell, is like, you know, what's going on with the mouth? Are we smiling, right? So yeah, it's really— I've been enjoying playing around with that, just like even on the in-breath, you know, kind of almost playing a bit of a note, but you know, just smiling like on the in and just gladdening the mind with that because it's smiling. Yeah, there's that like neurological, physiological connection going on, like mind-body, which is kind of beautiful. And that works too with the idea here with mindfulness of in and out breathing and kind of that pincer movement between the body and the mind. So then we're going to hit the feelings, right? So again, it's really wonderful to bring the breath into it, really smile into that gladdening. And then again, it It comes together. So the feelings then actually become, oh, we actually are joyful. Feeling that joyful success and satisfaction was beautiful too, because really the gliding also works with the wholesome sort of thoughts. These are wholesome thoughts because it's coming back to just being satisfied with just being aware that you're smiling. It's like we don't need anything else. Just the being aware that we're smiling right now is enough. Coming back to just a dabble-do-ya of satisfaction. And so that's a wonderful way to like glide, especially. Yeah, just a dabble-do-ya.

**Speaker B:** I love that, EJ.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, no, I've, well, I've heard that, you know, other students, and I believe Dhammarato say that when it comes to satisfaction is, you know, just the tiniest bit, right? Just this is enough. Because, and it's funny though, because, you know, I've stumbled upon this in practice, right, is when you hit just the dab and you have just enough satisfaction, again, it's just satisfaction in a way that it feels complete. It's whole. It's without lack. And that kind of comes back to the whole idea of wholesomeness, right? Which really does work into the Four Noble Truths and Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. And, you know, the end of dissatisfaction. Yeah, it's just wonderful. But yeah, it's interesting really coming back to the wholesomeness and that wholesome quality. There isn't, you know, that feeling of lack because we're just like satisfied with being aware of the smiling or, you know, of the breath. Oh, well, just being aware this is a long in-breath right now. This is enough, right? And on the out-breath, it's just like, oh yeah. And there's an abundance too that can come, an abundant joy, you know, and it's wonderful. And just to be able to return to this here and now as I'm talking, as there is talking going on. Yeah. That's sort of a fun thing to play around with though, as we talk in Sangha calls, or, you know, if anybody is out there listening or in the future, what have you, you know, is to come back to this, you know, this breath, this moment, even when you're like listening to talks or calls and just to return. And that's the beautiful thing is we, like, as I think practitioners, it's very helpful to have that time to get into seclusion, to get into a safe place, and to really work on cultivating and developing developing these skills, but then when we're kind of out, or if we're in talks or calls, any like little bit when we just remember, we return, right? And we come on back home to this breath, to this smile, you know, into this gladness. It's like, okay, this is it. And just that over and over and over again. You know, Dhammarato talks to, you know, about the shampoo Dharma, rinse and repeat. But that's it, right? And so you might hear some phrases and it's like the same thing repeated over and over again, but this is a good test because we often have in our minds, you know, the idea that we need something new. We need like that new thing to like get the fix, right? But if we can kind of come back and be satisfied with the repetition, that means we're going to be able to find satisfaction a lot easier because we can just come on back. You know, the restlessness doesn't come up. And I think it also works quite well, one, discussing things with people too, because sometimes, you know, maybe a little bit of that super.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary:

The talk, led by Speaker A in the absence of Scott (Dhammarato), focuses on **Step 10 of Anapanasati: Gladdening the Mind**. The discussion is practical and experiential, emphasizing that this step can be accessed at any time, not just sequentially.

**Key Themes and Practices Discussed:**

1.  **The Physical Gateway to Gladness:** A primary method discussed is using a **physical smile** to trigger mental gladness. Speaker A references "the smiling of the mind," noting the powerful mind-body connection where a physical smile can induce a joyful mental state.

2.  **The "Pencil" Experiment:** Speaker B shares a scientific analogy (from the book *Thinking, Fast and Slow*) about priming: holding a pencil horizontally in the teeth (forcing a smile) can gladden the mind, while holding it with the lips (forcing a frown) has the opposite effect. This illustrates how accessible and immediate the tool of physiology is.

3.  **Cultivating Satisfaction ("A Dabble-Do-Ya"):** The speakers connect gladdening to generating **satisfaction** (*santutthi*). The goal is not a huge euphoric state, but a subtle, complete sense of "this is enough." Examples include finding satisfaction simply in being aware of the smile or noticing the quality of the breath (e.g., "this is a long in-breath"). This satisfaction is "wholesome" because it lacks craving or a sense of lack.

4.  **Integration in Daily Life:** The talk emphasizes applying this practice **off the cushion**. Whether listening to a talk, in conversation, or doing daily tasks, one can "come back home" to the breath and a gentle smile. This repeated return is the practice—like "shampoo Dhamma: rinse and repeat."

5.  **Overcoming the "Need for New":** The repetitive nature of the practice is framed as a beneficial test. Finding satisfaction in repetition helps counteract the restless mind that constantly seeks novelty, thereby reducing *dukkha* (suffering/discontent).

**Core Message:** Gladdening the mind is a readily available skill. By using the physical act of smiling as a trigger, one can cultivate a small, sufficient, and wholesome feeling of satisfaction in the present moment. This practice can be continuously revisited, transforming routine activities into opportunities for joy and contentment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several metaphors and stories to explain the concept of "gladdening the mind":

**1. The Pencil Metaphor (from Speaker B):**
This is a story about psychological priming. The speaker references an idea from the book *Thinking, Fast and Slow* (likely by Daniel Kahneman). The metaphor is that **holding a pencil horizontally in your teeth (forcing a smile) physiologically gladdens the mind**, while holding it with your lips (forcing a frown) has the opposite effect. This illustrates the direct, accessible mind-body connection.

**2. The Smiling of the Mind (from Speaker A):**
This is a **conceptual metaphor** where a mental state (gladness) is compared to a physical action (smiling). The speaker elaborates that you can "smile with the mind," and that this has a physical component—actually smiling with your mouth enhances the mental state, creating a "neurological, physiological connection."

**3. The Dabble-Do-Ya / "Just a Dab" (from Speaker A):**
This is a **metaphor for satisfaction**. The speaker uses the phrase "just a dabble-do-ya of satisfaction" and "just the tiniest bit" to describe how a small, complete, and wholesome feeling of satisfaction (e.g., from simply being aware of a smile or the breath) is enough. It counters the idea that we need a large or dramatic experience to be content.

**4. The Pincer Movement (from Speaker A):**
This is a **military or tactical metaphor** used to describe the method of *Anapanasati* (mindfulness of breathing). The practice works like a pincer movement, approaching experience from both the **body** (the breath, the smile) and the **mind** (the feeling/gladdening) simultaneously to capture the totality of the present moment.

**5. Shampoo Dharma: Rinse and Repeat (attributed to Dhammarato):**
This is a **humorous, modern metaphor** comparing spiritual practice to the instructions on a shampoo bottle. It emphasizes that the path isn't about constantly seeking new information, but about the **repetition** of core practices ("rinse and repeat"). The test is to find satisfaction in that repetition instead of restless seeking.

**6. Coming Back Home (from Speaker A):**
This is a **common journey metaphor**. The breath, the smile, and the present moment are described as **"home."** The practice is framed as repeatedly "returning" or "coming on back home" whenever you remember, emphasizing safety, familiarity, and ease.

**7. The Wholesome Thought as Gliding (implied by Speaker A):**
The speaker connects gladdening to "wholesome thoughts" and describes it as a way to **"glide."** This suggests a metaphor of **effortless, smooth movement** (like gliding on ice or air), contrasting with the struggle and friction of unwholesome or dissatisfied states of mind.

In summary, the talk uses metaphors from **science (the pencil experiment), bodily experience (smiling, a dab), household chores (shampoo), military strategy (pincer movement), and journeying (coming home)** to make the abstract process of "gladdening the mind" tangible, accessible, and practical.
