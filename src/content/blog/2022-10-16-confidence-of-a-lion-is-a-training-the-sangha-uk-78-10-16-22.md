### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Well, everybody, welcome to the Sunday Dhamma chat. Today we're going to talk about doubt. At least I think we'll talk about doubt. I still have a little doubt about that. And the way that it was asked actually was more from the other side of trust. But let's look more in-depth at what doubt is, because this is actually the position that we existentially find ourselves in as a way of attitude. And so the child starts out with I need help. I can't do it without help. We start out kind of with that existential position. It's got a base of reality in it. I can't find that tit on my own. It's got to be plopped in my face. Okay, so we start from that very moment of we need help in order to survive. It's a survival issue, and people who don't deal with that by being nurtured when they're infants wind up with really severe mental states, one of which of the diagnoses is separation anxiety, abandonment. They say they have an abandonment issue because they won't let anybody that's around them leave, because they feel terrified when somebody moves away from them. They're completely dependent upon being around other people. Okay, uh, so that's kind of the worst case of it. But we can also see that that probably happened very early in life, that kind of post-traumatic stress disorder, um, but that we all eventually get into that feeling of having been abandoned when mommy stops nurturing and starts telling us what to do. We become mommy's little helper rather than mommy's tender infant. There's kind of a changeover that happens, and I don't think anybody ever gets over that. Okay, so suddenly we're out in the world of, uh, I can't do it. Which is just slightly different than "I can't do it on my own," or "I can't do it without help." But the other one, worse kind of, is that it can't get done, and help or not. And that this kind of state of mind of not being able to help oneself, not getting what oneself wants, lead people into despair. That's basically what despair is about, is feeling all boxed in with no way out. God above's not going to help, and I can't help myself, or Mommy's not going to help, or the society is not going to help, or the bill's not— we all get into that state from time to time, uh, state of despair. Got doggy society happening right now. Two big dogs are blocking the door, but here comes the magic human to straighten it out. So anyway, back to the point about doubt, and that is that we start off in this existential position of being a failure. And we're either a complete failure, or we're a failure unless we get somebody to fix it for us. We need grace, we need mercy, we need salvation, we need something to help us out, we need a card up the sleeve. We need a tricky way out, something that we could do and get away with it, to cheat, to hide in a baggage car or something like this. This is the kind of mentality that we develop of trying to get along when we think that we can't get along in society. So actually, that means then that this is a practice that we have to move through. Is to move out of the state of doubt about who can I get to help me. In fact, that's one of the first hurdles that everybody has that they call religious, because they're looking for someone to help them out of the misery and suffering that they've gotten themselves into. And so we have to get out of that into the state of, now I can't get any help, There's no one to help me. Can I do it myself? Am I capable of doing it? That's what really we're getting into with Anapanasati, is beginning to get the sense of success over and over and over again. Because look how much doubt that we've been going through. It's kind of filled up our bucket. So we have to kind of grind this in, of getting into the state of knowing, wait a minute, I can do this. I can grow up and be a human and be a full adult and get along in the world, not just getting by, but one of the winners here. This is part of the reason that the Buddha was known as a lion or a bull, okay? Guys that knew what they were talking about and got their way from, in a way, not just sheer force of knowledge but sheer force of personality and just 'there it is' kind of thing. And when you associate with those, you become like them. There's a fire that goes off when you recognize that they've got it, they can do it, so can you. That's the spark, okay? And we have to keep practicing that first three things over and over and over again. And that is, is that we got to get the Sati, we got to remember to keep practicing Keep remembering to do this over and over again. Keep remembering to look at what you're doing. Look at whether or not you're creating a victimhood for yourself. Look at the kind of language that you use. Look at the words like "long" and "tired" and "heavy" and "work," "try." Start looking at how we put words together when we're speaking and thinking to ourselves that already are loaded with victimhood. So we begin to change our language intentionally out of being the victim that is suffering because he can't get what he wants, into being the lion who is quite satisfied with the way things are right now. And the situation can be exactly the same. The difference is our attitude, and that's what needs to be changed. And in fact, none of us are, let us say, so messed up that we get locked up. We're all out there capable of living our lives in society. So the question would then be, well, why can't we go live that life as if we own the darn thing, because you do. Not a victim, you're the champion here. One of the ways that we talk about it is, is that, uh, everyone, each and every one of them, even the ones who were really messed up, every one of us is an emperor of our own personal pile of dirt. We all own our own dirt. And that's what we've gotten. You're the emperor of that pile of dirt. The question is, are you going to be buried under your pile of dirt? You're going to be scrambling your way out of that pile of dirt? Are you going to sit on top of your own world? It's a matter of an attitude. Now, the best and interesting part is, is that that dirt— what is that? That's the past. And so if you let the past define you then you're giving away your own power. That really, the power comes from the being able to be here now and wake up and see what's going on and know that you can do that, to trust that you can see what's going on right now and get a big load out of it. And that you can do that next time, you can do that again. Then you get the attitude of no matter what happens, I can take care of it happily. Doesn't matter, I can get arrested and joke with the cops. A little tighter, please. And so If you recognize that you can handle anything, then guess what? With partly the wisdom, we stay out of those circumstances because we know we can handle them anyway. There's actually a kind of a law, a kind of a secret law, because it's kind of hard to understand, but we manifest the things that we think about. So if you're afraid of something, you're going to bring it to you. Okay, so since I don't think about cops handcuffing me, the likelihood of that happening is very low, especially since I live in a country where cops don't carry handcuffs. And so I would have to invent the handcuffs in order for that to happen, you see. And we can recognize that that's the case. Now there's something really important that got hidden away in the verbiage that I was just giving, and that is that you come to a state that you know, no matter how obstructed with hindrances your mind gets, you can throw that stuff out and come back to this present moment and see the truth and reality of the way things are right now. That's the first part of the paragraph. It's in the Majjhima Nikaya 48, the Samyans. The next part of the path, uh, uh, the statement or the paragraph is that one who knows, that's the first step. That's the first knowledge into nobility, and it is supermundane. The knowledge that you can sit on top of your own pile of dirt, any time you think that you're capable of doing that. It is supermundane in that way, above the world, on top of the world. It is a factor of the path. And it is noble, it's noble-minded to know that you can handle anything. You can handle a bar fight if you know where the back door is. Okay, so you can handle anything. That's the attitude. And here's the important point about it, is that it's not this attitude is not held by ordinary people. The vast majority of people do not think at the bottom and depths of their heart they can handle everything. We always feel, going back to the bottom line, is that we're a victim. When things are hard, got to work hard, got to play hard. Hard work here, really working. And so this is part of the society. If you actually know that you can handle anything quickly, easily, and enjoyably, then all of the world is out of sight. This is why it's referred to as, um, the job that needed to be done has been done. What was the job that needed to be done? Is getting out of the obstructions. Okay, so are the hindrances. And this sutta is actually called Obstructions. But this is just the first knowledge, but it is hardcore number one item that a student must learn through practice of Anapanasati, is get yourself to the state that you know that, wow, not only this is hot diggity dog good, but I can do this every time. That's partly what makes it so hot diggity dog good, because you know you've got it now. You've got it. You can handle it. That word is the Samma Sanghappa, that first knowledge, knowledge that you can fix your mind. But you can this time, at least this time I can walk across that gravel road barefoot. I will get to the other side. That's just an example, been there, done that one. And pretty soon after the, uh, uh, Vindhibhat, I began to like going barefoot. That's one of the reasons I don't want to go to town. I go to town about now, down about once every 3 months. I do at least put on some slippers and a shirt because I got to. You can't get out of the house without it. But that's the only time that I wear it. So I can go about 3 months and wear the shoes for about 3 hours, about an hour a month. But it was a training for a while. Now it's just, that's the way the feet work. All right, so if we can see that it's that way, that's the attitude of, oh, I could do anything, I could go to town if I wanted to barefoot. I just happened to, in this case, will wear the shoes because that's what's expected. I find it really funny to put on the shoes, walk across the street, and then take the shoes off when we go into the bank, and then come out of the bank where we spend all of our time, put the shoes on just to walk across the street to get in the car, and then take the shoes back off. And so the point of that is that it's a joke, that it can be played with, that I've got this wired, that there's no issue here other than the issue that this is just an old toy or a new toy to play with. That's that attitude, "I can handle it, do it." That's the Samma Sanghappa. The other word in Pali is the word Shraddha. And the word Shraddha actually has been so royally and grossly mistranslated that I think that it was translated badly for a very long time. Even high monks tend to not understand it. But the wrong translation is faith. Now what faith is, is faith is taking something that we didn't have good evidence for and take it in as, let us say, an unfounded belief. We've been doing that our whole lives. We've been taking a lot of stuff on faith. Most of the stuff that we learned from our parents, we just took it on faith. We didn't know that we evaluate all that stuff. And so now, we don't take it on faith, we investigate instead. So, this concept of the Shraddha is not a faith, it's actual confidence. But that confidence still has to be weighed with, or balanced with, several other things, including you keep investigating. Once you get that whole system going, that you've got to have the Sati that's balanced with the Investigation, which is balanced with the very little Right Effort that's needed anymore, because we've got this very heavy, weighty Samma Sanghappa sitting there for us. And so, that stuff, when we add confidence to it, that balances and rounds things out. So that we can have a very joyous, happy life every time we remember that, hey, we could do that right now if we just remember to. And one of the— back to that statement of this is the first knowledge that is noble— what that actually means is the Buddha here is defining the first step of Srotapanna. This is the first knowledge step to the path, the Noble Path. I thought that I would fill that little detail in there for you because that's actually quite profound, that if you want, if you're going into becoming a Srotapanna, the first thing that you got to get is a pocket full of confidence. And that can be handed over to you by your teacher, a handful at a time. And in fact, one of the ways that that happens is that they put the younger monks on the spot. They do that actually as a formality in the Mahayana, the Vajrayana traditions of Tibet, because they have set arguments that they go through, whatnot like that. And you got to kind of know what you're doing there, and so that kind of builds confidence. There's other things like putting on a robe and drying it out, and if you're in Tibet in the wintertime, that can be quite a trip. But we do it in Thailand all the time, put the Wet. I mean, what else are you going to do, hide in the woods until they dry? Why do that? Put them on wet. Um, so this is the— another one that happened was, is that, uh, I was asked to assist Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. In a talk, and he got just a little part of it started in Pali, or in Thai, uh, Thai, let us say his Thai-ish, and, uh, asked me to take it from there. And so it was about the Four Noble Truths, so I introduced the Four Noble Truths and said this, that, and the other about it, and then go back to him, and he says, no, you take it from here. He put me on the spot. I wasn't even a monk yet. He had me teaching right in front of him. Now, you're either going to grow some balls right then and there, or what? Do you have the idea, yeah, I can do that? Yeah, I know that I can do that. He thinks I can do it. I'm not going to fall on my face. Look at— he's not my judge, he's my teacher. He's my teacher, he's my master, he's putting me up to it. And that happens actually in universities, it happens in business, it happens in many places, but that's the kind of mentoring and then the leg up that we wouldn't do for ourselves. In fact, when guys just say, "Oh, well, I'm good enough to go be a meditation teacher, let me go charge $500 an hour for it." then that's not an easy way to get that kind of confidence, because he doesn't have much backup. So that's part of the quality that I'm talking about, is that I feel fairly comfortable that Ajaan Po would say yes to and agree to anything that I would say, because I've done it before. That makes me feel really good that I've got that backup, even though it's mental, in my mind, it's that solid foundation. I've got it. I've got it backed up through Ajahn Koh and through Vipassana, right back into the hierarchy in Thailand, all the way back to the Buddha, this tradition. Has been alive. Part of it is a little bit of baptism in fire. And guys who sit on the floor in their house for how many hours a day don't put themselves through this kind of test, and if they do, they're crazy. Actually, if we could take a side note on that, just to make the point: have you ever heard of ayahuasca and peyote ceremonies? Why is it done in ceremony? It's because you want to make sure that the guide is there, so that if somebody really freaks out, the guide will know what to do and how to talk to them and whatever like that. And so the people who go into the ceremony to do this stuff, then already have that confidence built in. That's why they're there. So they're unlikely anyway to go off and be nuts about it. So that's another example of what we're talking about, and this is part of what there is of Sangha. And I'm really pleased to say that right now Eric His stage of the path is he's up in Moyet right now, occasionally sending photos back of the various, let us say, smiles that we see as he's doing his various things. And in fact, there's quite a lot of cleaning that he's doing with a high-pressure water hose. I saw several photos of that. And I recognize every table. They haven't even moved the tables since Bhikkhu Buddhadasa died. That's not done at his new one. He's put in a whole lot of monsoonal moke in there, too. But I thought that I would mention that, that it's not closed to Westerners. It's that they have to kind of meet halfway, and often Westerners are not willing to go through what it takes. I think in fact, living in India for about 3 years off and on, basically from '75 until '79, that I kind of learned enough about how to get along at Wat Soan Mokkhaphan. When I arrived there anyway, been in a lot of Thai temples and whatnot. And so it's kind of like you have to become Asian in a way to get into an Asian wat really well. I think that that was part of what Eric was doing because he spent, oh, 6 months at one time. This was the problems with COVID and he couldn't get into one of the wats because it was closed, and the people who closed it were the building, but lay people would have been fine if he came in. But lay people said no, no, there's a— The Thais, by the way, are still really strict about it. And so With Eric, he's actually fitting in now really, really well, and I'm really glad to see that. I can see it because of one example is there's a photo of him actually reading walking meditation that's done at Wat Soan Mokkh every week, probably more people trailing along behind Eric. That's kind of a sign that he's being, you know, put to work, assigned those duties. Not just spray washing furniture— concrete furniture, by the way— but he's actually being given some Dharma duties. And so that fits in with what talking about it. But in fact, one of the things he said, that it was like I with Achan Po. Achan Po in 1983 didn't know very much English at all, but he sure knew the Dharma. That's what Eric says, that this guy that he's with, he doesn't know English much, but he sure knows the Dharma. And he's the abbot of the wat at, uh, at Loy Et. And they met By the way, down here at Wat Chonpo, he is now currently— actually, he's back and forth. So Achan Po is now 83— no, 93— and he is still the abbot of Wat Soen Mokkh, though most of the actual abbot duties are done them. So it really feels comfortable to have that lineage, to know that you're part of that group. And also, from my mother's perspective, the highest quality of human beings on the planet Earth, that we live up to the standards that any religion tries and fails to live up to, because we can help each other do it, rather than fuss at each other when we fail. That's an actual key quality. That's a really key quality, that we're open and confess our own problems, and when we get into trouble with a whole raft of it back, in the sense of it— on one occasion I criticized one of my fellow American monks at Wat Soen Moon because he didn't know how to meditate. Well, he'd just arrived at the Wat employed as a Peace Corps volunteer. At a refugee camp that was breaking up at the time. And so he heard about Bhikkhu Buddhadasa way up there and he came down here. So it was really unfair for me who had been practicing meditation in what, 10 years. That's really, really interesting. Like a 2-year-old dog just tears into a brand new baby puppy for no reason at all. And that's how I feel about it now. But then it felt good. I'm better than he is because I can meditate and he He can't, haha. Well, it didn't take very many hours before a whole delegation of monks, some of whom I knew and some of which I didn't— there was probably between 9 and 15, I didn't count— they filled the place, only to make sure to tell me that monks don't criticize one another. That was the first opportunity, and I've seen that at play very strongly ever since. So I learned that lesson well, and I learned it a second time by mistake. I knew it immediately that I'd made a mistake, and I ruined my relationship with that monk because he was smoking. At that time, I had thought that, well, like everybody else, smoking is bad. Now I know, because I know the Vinaya very well, that smoking was allowed by the Buddha. He even allowed a pipe. I don't even know what they were smoking because they didn't have tobacco, but that's one of the secrets of the Vinaya. Okay, and that was wrong of me to mention that he was smoking because it wasn't even against the rules that I had in my mind. So, if we can learn it like that from a group of friends who really want to help us to shut our flap, then we learn well to not criticize others. And that's a really, really big foundation of the Sangha. Now, the extreme example of that would be that if a monk misbehaves and no one but he or the Sangha know about it, then they will keep quiet and not tell anyone. But if the community knows and they have a whole lot to say about it, then he is their business now. That the monks don't fight back or pay off debts or loans that monks make, anything like that. But if there's something in the Sangha like this one of criticizing another monk, that's kept within the Sangha. And the reason for that is if the young boy's family finds out that he's made a mistake, they'll haul him out just to save face and he won't out by his family, they have permission to do that. In fact, we actually see the other way around. We have to actually have permission from my mother to join. She's dead. Patriarchal society. I think that's the Thai tradition. It's not in Vinaya, but it's really strongly a Thai tradition. You don't ordain without your mother's permission. But it's exactly the other way around because it's the mothers who were going to be dragging you and get into the wat anyway. So, this idea on the other side is that you don't also want to let the crowd know who has attained anything, that it's not their business. And what happened with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and other monks that become famous, is that the monks then have to protect Anagami from the lay people who want something from him with a magical mind. One of the examples of that is that on Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's birthday at Wat Soi Mokkhin, they still hold the tradition that they do not serve any food and the monks do not go out for pindapat on his birthday. Why? Because everybody in town wants to be there lathering him with food in order to make an Arahant on his birthday. So we put a stop to it. I had not only him fasting, but the whole wat fasted. If you don't want to fast, go home with these lay people that have all this food they want to use. Um, and so, uh, the lay people kind of figure it out anyway, partly because they know what they're So monks who become known for being able to keep the Dhamma and the Vinaya together are actually— a lot of them are quite famous in Thailand. Various people, various wats will have photos of several famous monks in their homes because they want something from the picture. And if all they want is an inspiration and a memory, a point of Sati, then that's a good thing to do. But there's a lot of magical thinking, and because of that, a lot of what happens in the Sangha is quasi-secret. It's intentionally secret, but it becomes quasi-secret because it's also a revolving door. In the sense that men can ordain and then disrobe, and then ordain again and disrobe, and ordain again and disrobe. And that generally has to do with a young man's mother. She wants him to work in the fields now. He's out of the robes and in the fields. She doesn't need him anymore, she can get rid of him and put him back in a wad. So this becomes quite convenient And the tradition is up to 7 times, because that actually happened in the time of the Buddha. I was in and out of the temple 7 times. So that's the tradition. I think in some places they do it a little tighter. I've heard some places in Thailand, 3 is enough. But the other side of that is that if a guy's been in and out for that, the fourth or fifth time that he joins, he's already a valuable asset to the Sangha right then and there on his ordination day. He probably already has completely memorized the ordination ceremony. He didn't have to get it hand-fed to him like a beginner. I think that we've been dancing around that that issue of what you were talking about in the first place, and that is that we've got to find a way of trusting that everything's going to work out just fine. And all I have to do to bring that about is watch what's going on, take note of it, and stay out of the way of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. Stay out of it. And the first place to learn how to stay out of it is by staying out of the fights that we have between our ears. Just to come out of it and just come back to the state of peace. Practice that over and over and over again. I can do this, I can do this. Ah, this is good breath. Over and over again become Anapanasati, and slowly, slowly, like a drop in a bucket, it begins to fill up that confidence. I can do this. I am one of the world. I see myself in a way as worth. I can do this. I belong to this group of people who are very high-class people. I belong to this group. I'm in. That's kind of a confidence that I can't quite describe to you. Being one of the old boys, being one of the insiders, being accepted and acceptable. Know that you are, that you earned it. What have you earned? Actually, you've just earned what you needed to earn by stopping what needed to be stopped. So when there's nothing much left, there's no place to go and nothing to do, and you just hang out with your buddies. That's all there is to it. That we just kind of stop doing. That's what's the quality of evil anyway. Evil is a deed, evil deeds, Kamma, unwholesome or dark Kamma, which is action. If you don't take any actions, you're not doing anything wrong. Can you just sit around happily? Can you? How about you, Vedana? Can you just sit around happily? Is it easier to do when you're sitting around with others who were sitting around happily?

**Speaker B:** Can you hear me?

**Speaker A:** Yes, I can hear you.

**Speaker B:** Okay, of course. That's the thing. Yeah, that's even the answer to every other question on the mundane side with other people in the Sangha. They're having other imaginations of how things should be. If you're sitting there just dwelling in goodness And they just can't stand it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that confidence, that's a nice, nice feeling. You're above it all. It doesn't matter anymore. There is a phrase, right? It's all mind over matter. If you don't mind, it don't matter. It's all mind over matter. Your mind is in control. The mind is the forerunner. And if you don't care, then you're not creating anything, especially creating problems. So it really is that little phrase, mind over matter. We're the ones who are making it matter because we care, grasp, we cling, we want, like it. You see that process going on mind. That's, by the way, the teaching of the Paticcasamuppada. I just gave it in reverse. See, first off, I don't care a whole lot about stuff, and if we would stop caring, then my wanting of it would be very low, and I'd wind up being satisfied without it. The fact— the problem was, is that it's not that I liked it and I wanted it, it's that I cared too much. And when I stopped caring at all, And I'm just satisfied without it, whatever it was. Same thing, money, glory, a new laptop, a new girlfriend, getting rid of an old one, whatever it is that we want. Probably not going to get it anyway. I just be satisfied with the way things are. Because look, all my buddies are satisfied. They've got No problems with your dreaming up in order to solve. Why should I? Thank you for repeating it. Pardon?

**Speaker B:** That— thank you for repeating it.

**Speaker A:** Well, it has to be repeated because it's so foreign. The first time we hear it, you don't quite understand it, but when I start giving it to you over and over and over again, it begins to sing. Wow, I really was stupid at the age of 3 when they put me to work. I thought that was the right thing to do at the time. And I've been thinking that stupid thought ever since. And now I can recognize, no, I don't. I can sit down and enjoy a moment or two or three or a year. But you don't have to have this restlessness of, I got to get up and go do something.

**Speaker B:** Where comes the lion's roar in with this?

**Speaker A:** Say again?

**Speaker B:** Where comes the lion's roar in with this?

**Speaker A:** Topic. The lion's roar comes in when we keep recognizing that we can do it, we can throw this thought out of the mind, we can clean up our act right now. I can get out of it, I don't have to get stuck into it over and over again. That's what most people are worried about. In fact, I hear it still on Skype of, "Oh, poor me, I keep having these thoughts, how do I get rid of these thoughts?" thoughts. And that's the way to do it, is to stop having thought. How do I get rid of these thoughts? And say, hi thought, I see you before. Here, sit down beside me and let's do nothing for a little while. But no, we're constantly in a conflict within our own minds. The answer to that is come out of the conflict and sit down and enjoy it often enough that you can begin to recognize that you can sit down and enjoy it anytime you wanted to. To do. In the beginning, it was a training. A way to think about it is music. Okay, music is that you have to train, have to practice that violin, you have to practice that piano over and over and over again. And the kids who wind up being really good at the piano is the one who enjoys his practice. But the kid who is practicing only because Mommy told him to practice is probably going to be quitting piano lessons within a couple of years, and too soon for Mom and not soon enough for him. But if he's enjoying the piano, then he might become a real pianist. So, once he becomes a pianist, part of the pianist process is to do recitals, getting thrown in the fire once or twice a year. Having to perform in public. Eric, we'll see you later. Okay, so just as so then, when we first start performing in public, it is a performance. But if you performed now over and over and over again, let us even say the same simple song, you know it so well that now it's really playful. You can play all over with it. So, this issue of practice, performance, and play, that you can see that one of the reasons why so many professional musicians are in fact so loved, is because they're not performing music anymore, they're playing it, they're having a ball with it! They're dancing and jumping all over the stage with delight with their music. And you can learn to do that with your life. You have to learn to play with it. It's a toy to play with, but you have to learn how to play with it. That's first the practice. We have to keep practicing over and over again. And then after we're skilled, we know that we're capable of performing above it. We can do it. We got that thing. Okay? And then after that stage comes the playful one. Anicca part is when it's so in there, so rehearsed and so practiced that your natural state of being is going to be joyful. Yeah, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Can I ask a specific question?

**Speaker A:** Certainly.

**Speaker B:** So, because I see that the happiness of being around other practitioners is something that is something by itself, and it's, it's beneficiary for the overall practice. I go to a place where people are that are practicing more of the Mahayana, I guess, Tibetan way, and it's, it's drenched in magical thinking and in so much clinging and so much unsatisfactoriness because of it, that it starts to influence certain parts of mood that are coming up for me.

**Speaker A:** All of those people though are there for the same reason that you are. The question is, are there other people there that they come to see? Who are the nobles? Who's the Abbot of this place? Don't judge a place by the commoners that you see so that are so commonly. It's like, don't look at the 99 sheep that are dirty. Go find where is the clean one. It's got to be a clean one there someplace, otherwise the dirty ones wouldn't be there walking around.

**Speaker B:** We'll see.

**Speaker A:** Just a bunch of dirty sheep, huh? That's common too. They're all thinking that there's a clean one there and there's not.

**Speaker B:** I mean, that's just over my practice in certain moments.

**Speaker A:** Well, it may be worthwhile to go back and take a second look now that you know more about what you're looking for. Look for the one who keeps laughing.

**Speaker B:** That would be me.

**Speaker A:** One who says we're here to learn to be happy.

**Speaker B:** I keep looking.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay. More than likely he's dressed the part in robe, and generally the Abbot of a wad has been a monk for 20 years, which means that that's enough time for Dhamma to rub off, practiced or not.

**Speaker B:** Rubs off after so many years. Is there any, is there a tip or some kind of, let's say.

**Speaker A:** Little note? This is Tibetan, you probably know more about the place than I do. If it were Thai, I'd give you a bunch of tips.

**Speaker B:** It's not It's not so much, maybe, yeah, it's human, it's not about culture, it's about human nature.

**Speaker A:** Every society is crazy and every other society knows it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the finger is always pointing.

**Speaker A:** Every religion is crazy, and all the religions but that one know it. And that's just an interesting, happy way to see reality as it is. Hey, I can handle the fact that everybody's crazy out there. The only people who are sane are the ones who don't know that they're crazy. Me too, I'm crazy. At least I know it and happy about it. Been there, done that. Yeah, it's okay. Enjoy being crazy. And my wife is there laughing. In fact, here at the house we have a game. In Thai language, the word is ba, okay? And, uh, means drunk. Ba is easily translated as crazy. And so when Kitty is acting up and having fun, they say, Kitty, you're crazy. Everybody, oh, you're crazy, and everything is just all over the place. And so this is a really crazy household, and we love it. So that's the whole idea. It's not that we could hide from the craziness and say, oh, everything is okay, there's no problem here, while we're lying to ourselves and we know it. The answer is to be joyfully aware you're doing, knowing that that's your choice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Want to do something different, you can do it. Because you have that choice. And that's power. That's real, real power, much different than the power that people have, like throwing laser buds at each other or what they do in the— but that's kind of a child's mentality of power, is, is active strength or kinetic energy. What I'm putting out is, is that no, the Real power is in potential energy, the quiet energy. That energy is the energy of knowing. It could get noisy if you want to, but you choose not to. I'm not lying here. You can roar, just ignore it, or in the way of, I don't care. It's not ignore in the sense of I can't see it. It's I can see it clearly, choose not to do anything about it. I don't care. And to do that first in our own minds, that's where it really needs to be done. We need to practice it in our own mind. Practice it. But at the end, you can practice it with.

**Speaker B:** Perform.

**Speaker A:** So in fact, that's the whole point about the teaching of the Buddha. This is all about friendship. See what's clearly there, accept it as it is, and refine it and change it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the refining part.

**Speaker A:** Purification process, but you got to start with what, what's there.

**Speaker B:** Dhammarato being, being very, very clear and delicate with it in the way it needs to be dealt with.

**Speaker A:** As if it were dealing with a tender infant who didn't grow up first time right. How to give it a second chance. Starting with tenderheartedness. Got to care for yourself.

**Speaker B:** So much, so much violence going on.

**Speaker A:** That's the Buddhist teaching. Get ourselves in that state, then we can do that with others and we can nurture others, each other to smile and giggle. Well, one out of three wasn't bad. Two smiles and one giggle.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that was the one that was referring to my first comment about the lion's roar in combination with all the mundane social cultural interaction thing mixed in with some kind of pseudo-Dharma, not only not only accepting the Sugru Dhamma, but seeing what clearly goes on for those people and in the situation and inside of me, and making it smooth and tender and not imposing their lives easy.

**Speaker A:** By not disagreeing with them. That would be, that would be.

**Speaker B:** Worthy of getting shot. I'm not even in the— I'm not even near this. And it's— I.

**Speaker A:** Hear that victimhood. You guys hear him being a victim all of a sudden?

**Speaker B:** No, I didn't mean it that way.

**Speaker A:** You said it that way. I'm nowhere near, and I don't I know where that's going. Yeah, and I thought I'd pick you up and dust you off and say, hey man, you can't— remember, you can do this. You're worthy. You're on top of your own world. Of course, you're not far enough away from anything. The door to paradise is right in bloody front of you. All you have to do is to know the key. The key is Sati, to remember to turn the crank and push. Yeah, take a look at what's going on. Turn that crank and push that door open. That's the right effort, and right into Paradise you go. Yeah, folks, it's close by. In fact, you look like you're right in it right now.

**Speaker B:** I always think about Angulimala in this situation.

**Speaker A:** Like, I always stop. When the Buddha says, I have stopped, you stop too, right? Stop thinking I can't. Exactly. So let's not do the Angulimala story. We'll do that another time. Ah, Jassen, you have anything to say? You've been over there smiling happily.

**Speaker B:** Not much to say. I'm enjoying the conversation.

**Speaker A:** Uh, you know, what about you? I think it was, I think it was beautiful. I think it was beautiful the way it worked out, and you being around lions who are noble, able to nurture you by a lion. How beautiful is that as an example? That's really well, and then I really like it. And then becoming the lion yourself Even by being thrown in front of the lions by lions. Wow. That's a way to grow confidence. I get it. I get it. I'm glad. I'm glad you got it. That's great. Keep remembering this. Practice it well. Yeah. Okay, guys. Well, thanks so much. This has been a really great talk.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, guys. Thank you. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A), centers on overcoming **doubt** and cultivating **confidence (shraddha)** through meditation and community support. Here is a summary of the key themes:

---

### **Main Themes**

1. **The Root of Doubt**  
   - Doubt stems from an early existential feeling of helplessness—the infant’s need for help to survive.  
   - This can evolve into victimhood, despair, and a belief that we cannot handle life without external salvation.

2. **From Victim to Champion**  
   - The practice is about shifting from a victim mindset (“I can’t do this”) to a confident, “lion-like” attitude (“I can handle anything”).  
   - This change is not about circumstances, but about **attitude**: seeing yourself as the “emperor of your own pile of dirt” (your past/karma) and sitting on top of it, not buried under it.

3. **Building Confidence Through Practice**  
   - **Anapanasati** (mindfulness of breathing) is key: repeatedly experiencing small successes builds confidence.  
   - The first “supramundane” knowledge on the path is realizing **you can always return to the present moment and see things clearly**, no matter the mental obstructions.

4. **Shraddha as Confidence, Not Blind Faith**  
   - *Shraddha* is often mistranslated as “faith,” but it means **confidence based on investigation and direct experience**.  
   - This confidence is balanced with mindfulness (*sati*), investigation, and right effort.

5. **Role of the Sangha and Teacher**  
   - Confidence is nurtured by the **Sangha** (spiritual community) and teachers who “throw you in the deep end” (e.g., asking you to teach publicly) to help you grow.  
   - The Sangha supports without harsh criticism; it’s a safe space to learn and confess faults.  
   - Example: Eric’s integration into a Thai monastery shows how immersion in a practice community builds confidence and belonging.

6. **From Practice to Play**  
   - The path moves from **practice** (effortful training), to **performance** (ability to apply skills), to **play** (joyful mastery where life becomes a playful, effortless dance).  
   - Like a musician who first practices, then performs, then plays with delight.

7. **Dealing with External Challenges**  
   - When around others who are stuck in “magical thinking” or negativity, look for the noble ones—those who are joyful and embody the Dhamma.  
   - The real power is **not reacting**—choosing peace and clarity over conflict, internally and externally.

8. **Non-Criticism and Compassion**  
   - A core ethic in the Sangha is to avoid criticizing others; instead, support each other with tenderness, as if nurturing a child or healing one’s own inner infant.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Doubt is overcome by building confidence through direct experience** in meditation and daily life.  
- **Change your language and attitude** from victimhood to ownership and capability.  
- **Community and wise teachers** are crucial for nurturing this confidence.  
- **True power is in peaceful, mindful presence**, not in force or reaction.  
- The goal is a joyful, unshakable ease where you can “handle anything happily.”

The talk blends psychological insight, meditation advice, and community wisdom, emphasizing that liberation starts with trusting your own ability to be present and free.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on your transcript, the speaker uses a rich tapestry of metaphors and stories to illustrate the path from doubt and victimhood to confidence and mastery. Here is a breakdown of the key ones:

### **Core Metaphors**

1.  **The Pile of Dirt / Emperor Metaphor:** This is the central, recurring metaphor.
    *   **The Dirt:** Represents your past, your kamma, your accumulated problems and mental baggage.
    *   **The Emperor:** Represents you, the individual with agency and ownership.
    *   **The Choice:** The key question is your attitude toward your "dirt." Are you **buried under it** (a victim), **scrambling out of it** (struggling), or **sitting on top of it** (in control, with perspective)? This symbolizes moving from a victim mentality to a sovereign, confident one.

2.  **The Lion (and the Bull):** Represents the confident, noble, fearless practitioner.
    *   The Buddha is described as a lion or bull—someone with sheer force of personality and knowledge.
    *   The goal is to transform from a helpless victim into a **lion** who is "quite satisfied with the way things are right now." The **"lion's roar"** is the confident knowledge that you can handle any mental obstruction.

3.  **Fire & Spark:** The transmission of confidence from teacher to student is likened to a **spark** that ignites a **fire**. When you see someone who "has got it," that recognition can light a fire of confidence in you: "they can do it, so can you."

4.  **Music: Practice, Performance, Play:** This metaphor describes the stages of mastery on the path.
    *   **Practice:** The repetitive, disciplined work (like Anapanasati).
    *   **Performance:** The ability to apply it under pressure (like being put on the spot to teach).
    *   **Play:** The joyful, effortless mastery where life becomes a toy to play with, not a problem to solve. The professional musician dancing with delight is the ideal.

5.  **Potential Energy vs. Kinetic Energy:** Real spiritual power is **potential energy**—the quiet, knowing energy of choice and non-reactivity. It's contrasted with **kinetic energy**—the noisy, forceful, childlike power of action and reaction. True power is choosing not to engage, not because you can't, but because you see clearly and "don't care" (in a non-attached way).

6.  **The Door to Paradise:** Enlightenment or peace is very close. **Sati** (mindfulness) is the **key**, and **Right Effort** is turning the crank and pushing the door open. It emphasizes accessibility.

7.  **Dirty Sheep / The Clean One:** When in a spiritual community, don't judge it by the many struggling practitioners ("dirty sheep"). Look for the accomplished one ("the clean one") who inspires them, implying that the presence of seekers suggests the presence of a true guide.

### **Key Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Infant's Existential Position:** The talk begins with the story of human development: we start life as helpless infants needing nurture. The trauma of moving from being "mommy's tender infant" to "mommy's little helper" creates a foundational sense of inadequacy and need for external help, which forms the root of doubt.

2.  **Being Put on the Spot by a Teacher:**
    *   **With Bhikkhu Buddhadasa:** The speaker recounts being asked by the renowned teacher Buddhadasa to take over a talk on the Four Noble Truths in front of him. This "baptism by fire" was a deliberate method to **forge confidence**—forcing the student to realize "I can do this."
    *   **With Ajaan Po:** Eric's current experience mirrors this. He is given responsibilities (leading walking meditation, cleaning) by a teacher who "doesn't know English much, but he sure knows the Dharma." This inclusion and testing build confidence and a sense of belonging.

3.  **Learning Through Correction in the Sangha:**
    *   The speaker tells a story of criticizing a fellow American monk for not knowing how to meditate. In response, a delegation of 9-15 monks came to him simply to say, **"monks don't criticize one another."** This was a powerful, non-aggressive lesson in the core Sangha virtue of supportive friendship, not criticism.
    *   A second story involves wrongly criticizing a monk for smoking (which is actually allowed in the Vinaya), which taught him to be careful of judgments based on incomplete knowledge.

4.  **Protecting the Community's Integrity:** The story of **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's birthday** illustrates the Sangha's protective wisdom. To prevent laypeople from engaging in "magical thinking" and overwhelming the monk with gifts to "make an Arahant," the entire wat would fast and not accept food. This shows how the community manages external projections to maintain a sane environment.

5.  **The Revolving Door of Ordination:** The explanation of why men in Thailand can ordain and disrobe multiple times (traditionally up to seven) serves as a story about cultural integration and practical wisdom. It shows how the Sangha accommodates societal needs (a mother's need for farm labor) and how a returning ordinand becomes a valuable asset, already knowing the rituals.

6.  **Ayahuasca/Peyote Ceremony Analogy:** This is used to underscore the importance of a **guide** and a **container** (Sangha) for intense spiritual work. The guide provides the confidence and safety net that allows for transformation, paralleling the teacher-student relationship in Buddhism.

7.  **Personal Anecdotes as Illustration:**
    *   **Going Barefoot:** The speaker's preference for going barefoot for months, only putting on shoes as a playful concession to social norms ("a joke... an old toy to play with"), exemplifies the "play" stage and non-victim attitude.
    *   **Handling Arrest:** The quip about being able to get arrested and joke with the cops ("A little tighter, please") illustrates the ultimate confidence of "I can handle anything."
    *   **The Crazy (Ba) Household:** The story of his household in Thailand, where being playfully "crazy" ( *ba* ) is celebrated, models the attitude of joyfully accepting the inherent craziness of life rather than resisting it.

### **Overall Narrative Arc**
The talk itself **uses a story-like structure**: it begins with the **origin story of doubt** (the helpless infant), moves through the **struggle** (being buried in dirt, seeking external saviors), describes the **training montage** (practice, being tested, learning Sangha norms), and points toward the **confident climax** (becoming the lion, the emperor, the musician at play). All the metaphors and stories serve this arc of moving from victimhood to sovereign, joyful confidence.
