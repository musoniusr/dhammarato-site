### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Today, Anicca, you want to share your joy. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** So,

**Speaker B:** okay, so after you told me yesterday, right, that it's about when I notice irritation, after I am saying, wow, present moment.

**Speaker A:** Wow.

**Speaker B:** When I noticed that irritation may occur sometimes after that, the practice is to make that irritation my friend, is to regard that irritation with the same way that I regard being in the present moment, to appreciate that irritation in just the same way. And to play with it. I remember you said to play with it in your body and the sensations and stuff. And I was laying down last night and I was like, you know, watching a movie with my girlfriend. I was, you know, I noticed going into the stream of thoughts and I was like, wow. And then I was like, oh, irritation. There it is again. How do I play with this? How do I do that? How do I actually make this my friend? What does that look like? And, you know, I'm just kind of like playing with it. And the image I gave to Dan today when I talked to him was that it's kind of like playing in a puddle. It's like, oh, I don't really know, you know, I don't really know how it works. I'll just splash a little there, splash a little there. I'll try to move this sensation. And, you know, and so I just was experimenting. And when I woke up this morning, there it all was again. Wow, irritation. Wow, irritation. And as I got further into my morning, I noticed that the irritation became much more subtle. It became much more gentle. And it was like, oh, irritation. Oh, wow. Present moment. And it was like, easy. It was easier. And I was starting to feel like how I feel when I get out of Samatha sits when I get out of the seclusion sessions. It was starting to sustain itself, these wholesome thoughts, great feelings. I felt so good. Oh man, I felt really good.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And there were other things, you know, like when I would notice your anxiety or doubt, I started You know, I realized I could be like, ah, I see you doubt, or, oh, that's okay. Oh, no, no, I'm being present right now. Thank you. And just like, you know, just letting it all be and being more—

**Speaker A:** I

**Speaker B:** don't know, there's just a lot more compassion that was there for myself and for all of it.

**Speaker A:** Perhaps a way of saying it is being less.

**Speaker B:** Being less? Yes.

**Speaker A:** You said being more, being more, and then you didn't have a word for it. So I think just being less.

**Speaker B:** There was less of stuff. And I was noticing, like, even when I was saying wow throughout the day and coming to the present moment, I could see that it was not as— I said that already— was not as irritating. But I also saw that it wasn't as big of a thing. It wasn't as like I needed to remind myself so much. It was more just like, oh, wow. And I noticed that there could be thoughts going on. And I could still be okay. I was still in that state. And that's what you were talking about when you say it's not the content of the thoughts that that's the problem. It's the dissatisfaction with the thoughts, with the content, with the phenomena. So I'm proud of myself. I congratulate myself. I've had huge success today. I did 5 seclusion sessions. And throughout most of the day, I was feeling good. I was in a good state of mind. I had the right attitude. I was talking about it with Dan and he's like, to me, it sounds like you got the whole Eightfold Noble Path in your back pocket. They were all the parts were together. Now, I wanted to start off saying that because I don't want to, sell my success short. You know, I want to acknowledge success, right? But now what I am coming— what I am experiencing now is one, very, very tired. Very, very tired. I was curious if you had— The

**Speaker A:** new bird, when it falls out of the nest and begins to fly, It gets tired. It's new wings. Yes.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Okay, good. I'm honestly just saying that made me feel a little bit more like I could understand what's going on with me, made me feel better because I noticed that I can't, I don't want to stop doing this either. I don't want to stop this momentum. I don't want to stop these good feelings, the sustaining itself, everything that's been happening for me. I don't want to stop it. I want to keep seeing doubt and irritation. I want to keep seeing, oh, wow, the present moment.

**Speaker A:** That's the enthusiasm.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Let the enthusiasm now be the grand assistant or the ally of right effort.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So the enthusiasm becomes the right effort. In the beginning, right effort is a struggle of an escape.

**Speaker B:** Say it again, please.

**Speaker A:** I said in the beginning, right effort has this— has the trouble of escape. We're trying to escape from something. But what you're beginning now, just beginning to get, is the joy of running rather than escaping from something.

**Speaker B:** Joy of running, huh?

**Speaker A:** In other words, the joy of having your mind correctly functioning.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** See, before, you working to get the mind to function correctly. Now that the mind is functioning correctly, you can enjoy that. Yes, but the tiredness is going to come back. But don't let the tiredness break your machine. Okay, don't let that go take you back down. Okay, I'm tired. Look at the tiredness. Yeah, I can see that too.

**Speaker B:** Right, right, right, right, right. And I've been doing that as well. Yeah. Good, good, good, good. So the relationship to practice is changing, is what I hear. So it's becoming more of an ally for me. I've spent the past 2 days like pulling, pulling, pulling, pulling, going, going, going, going, going. And now I can actually get that, okay, I'm on my feet. There's a speed that's going here, and I can trust— I can trust that that's with me. It's not like something I need to worry about holding on to.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's exactly correct. In fact, the trust would be a useful operative. Well, the Pali word is shraddha. And Shraddha is almost always incorrectly translated as faith. And the reason that I say that it's incorrectly translated is because the Christians own that word. They know what it means. Okay, you're not developing faith, you're developing confidence. Okay, the confidence that you know that you can do this. Yes, that's the Samma Sanghappa. That's the attitude that's becoming developed, the attitude of the winner rather than the attitude of the loser. So the attitude of the loser, the first right effort is an escape. We're trying to get out of the Dukkha. That's what victims do. They're trying to escape. Okay. But there comes a time when we are at our attitude begins to change in the sense of that Dukkha that we used to run away from and try to escape. Now we recognize more and more with more and more certainty that it can't catch us. Mm-hmm. And when it shows up, I see you there.

**Speaker B:** But yeah, I got you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly, exactly.

**Speaker A:** So this is all a matter of the path, and that many, many people over the centuries have been successful at this. And it's the same process for everyone, and it's there. That's the Eightfold Noble Path, where that fourth item, that Samma Sanghappa, the right attitude or the right way of thinking rather than one individual thought in this moment. Now we're getting a new way of thinking, a new way of looking, a new attitude about how we look at things is beginning to develop from that. I'm trying to get out of it. I'm trying to escape from it. Yeah, I can. I can escape it. I can get out. Wow. I don't have to do that right now. I don't have to do it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Now I do want to say that sometimes throughout the day today,

**Speaker A:** a lot—

**Speaker B:** I don't want to say a lot because that's making it into something, but there were many sensations of anxiety coming up through my stomach and in my chest. And I treated it the same way. I was like, ah, Anxiety. I see you. And I felt the anxiety and I tried to move it up and down and to the side like you've suggested. I even tried to see if I can move a spiral or like make it dance to a song.

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly. That's an interesting way of talking about it. See if you can get it to dance with a song.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, all this kind of stuff. And I was like, I don't really know what it is to play with this. I'll just try this and I'll just try that. And I got to say, I don't— there is some level of uncertainty with actually how to grapple with the anxiety or irritation when it is that intense. It does sometimes grab me still, because here I am like sustaining these good, good, good wholesome feelings and thoughts, right? And then there's like this It's like a showdown. It's like, what are we going to do now? And sometimes I just don't really know. I get a little lost in how to actually take care of that.

**Speaker A:** Okay, first off, those kinds of, let us say, episodes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that's a good way to put it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, they come and they have been coming, and that sometimes they come and you don't even know it. It comes, sneaks up behind you and grabs you, and you don't even know it. It's almost like your handcuffs are tied behind your back, but you don't even know that they're— that your hands are tied until you try to move them later. And then you found out. Okay, so, but now what's happening is that you're beginning to wake up in that process of getting tied up.

**Speaker B:** I'm beginning to see it very clearly before it happens, while it's happening, during, and also my attempt to, you know, dismantle it as well. Right.

**Speaker A:** Well, can stay with the congratulations that you can see it.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that's the way to do it. And another way of thinking about it is, is that this stuff only has weight through repetition, that in fact all a mind moment can only have weight when that mind moment is repeated over and over and over again. And so your choice is to whether or not to repeat wholesome thoughts or to repeat unwholesome thoughts. And before you started practicing, you didn't even know that you had a choice, and you didn't even know that it was a good idea to look to see that you had a choice. But most of us grow up in the delusion that what we think is who we are, and that's just things are and that we are our thoughts. Yeah. And that we don't recognize then when, let us say, mishap befalls us.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** That we don't make the connection between it was the thoughts that we had and the incident or the befallment that happened. And so in confusion, the human mind will say, well, it must have been something outside of me because I'm okay. It must be something outside of me that caused the problem because I'm okay. Well, that's the victim's position, that something outside has done this to me. Now you're beginning to wake up and recognize you've been in control all along and didn't know it. That basically the reason that your boat bumps into other boats is not because other boats are in your water, is because you're not watching where you're going. It basically—

**Speaker B:** yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so now you're waking up. Congratulations. Continue with that congratulations to continue to wake up to it. Now, this issue about the repetition is an important one in the sense that what we tend to do is we tend to struggle in a big way for a short period of time thinking that struggling has weight to it. Well, it only has bad feelings, basically. It doesn't have any weight. That what weight is, is the repetitive piling on and piling on and piling on and over and over and over again. And so in that regard, we have in fact been talking ourselves into feeling bad our whole lives, not recognizing that the the thoughts that we have are, let's say, a contributing factor to the way that we feel. Now that you're beginning to see that the way that you're thinking and the way that your attitude, etc., do contribute heavily to the way that you feel, now you have the new intention to start repeating that over and over and over again, to give that positive some weight. And whenever we see that we're having negative thoughts, then we don't want to repeat them. We want to stop those thoughts so that they don't pile on.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** OK, so if you have a thought that gives anxiety, if you have that thought again, it'll bring more anxiety. If you have it a third time and a fourth time and over and over and over and over and over again, that anxiety is going to build up. And so now that you're beginning to see not just that process of happening over and over again, but also you're beginning to see that you could come in and interrupt that process so that it doesn't keep piling on and piling on, that in fact you're going to start changing it so that you're going to be doing your piling on with this mind moment and the next mind moment One mind moment after another, a wholesome thought. One mind moment after another. And begin to let those pile up. That's the way that we practice. Okay, so that piling on is rhythm. That is music. The piling on of just junk is just noise. It's just, you know, we keep piling stuff on. We have this bad thought and that bad thought and this one. Over here and oh, it's his fault and all those Republicans are bad and all those Democrats are a bunch of crooks, they're liars, the Christians are no good. And, you know, we just go around thinking about all of these various things and with put-downs to it. And we don't recognize that that actually has great physiological damage. To us, that we— people do literally talk themselves into being sick. That, um, very, very many different examples of that. And one of them, which is the most spectacular, is spontaneous remission of cancer. That it just— I mean, they change their attitude, or they recognize, wait a minute, I'm doing something wrong, I got to stop doing it. And all of a sudden, the cancer just ended The doctors are surprised. The cancer goes away and nobody knows what's happening. Okay, so there are many things that are like that. There's actually an old joke about it. The guy goes to the doctor and he says, Doctor, every time I bump my elbow, it hurts. Why can't I? You know? And the doctor says, that means that all you need to do to get your arm to stop hurting is to stop bumping your elbow.

**Speaker B:** Stop doing that. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Doing it, right? Exactly. Whenever I do this, it hurts. Well, the answer is, well, stop doing that, okay? So it's not one bump that hurts the opal, it's the bumping and the bumping and the bumping and the bumping and the bumping and the bumping and the bumping that we keep doing, okay? So the things that go bump in the mind, we can put a stop to that in this present moment rather than continuing it on and on and on, to interrupt those thoughts. So if you're having a thought about one friend and you want him to do something, or you're trying to get him convinced to do something and you wake up to that, you can say, I'm going to stop talking about that to myself right now. I do not have to think about that guy. I do not have to think what I want from him at all. I can just stop that and recognize that right now I don't need whatever it is that I want from him. I'm okay right now. Maybe eventually I'll want it, but maybe eventually that time will get in, I'll start worrying about it again, and I'll have the wake-up thought, well, then I don't need it now either. Okay. And so now what we can begin to see that we actually create ourselves misery by wanting things that we don't have, and we're not going to get them from these people. So why do we keep thinking about what can I say? An example right now, this This is a really easy example for many people all over. I imagine that there are tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of people right now in the United States in the past 24 hours that are in their head writing to Joe Manchin to tell him what they think about him, that he doesn't keep his word, that he's a liar, that he's a crook, all of these kinds of words. And guess what? Almost none of those messages, none of those emails will get read. But many people are just spinning their minds and burning their minds and burning their minds. Oh, I don't like it because you did this. And, you know, okay, so that we do that. So look how many spinning mind moments of dissatisfaction, literally tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people, are going through when they don't have to. Because Joe Manchin is not going to change his mind no matter what you say to him. So why are you talking to him in your mind? You're not going to convince Joe Manchin in your mind either. Hmm. But we want and we want and we want and we want. And so we compose and we say, I'll say this and I'll say that. And who can I say it to? And who can I send a message to that will make sure that Joe Manchin actually hears what I want? Yeah,

**Speaker B:** okay, can I share an example with you?

**Speaker A:** He doesn't care about what I want. So now let's say, well, what can I do myself? So this is what we mean by repetitive piling on and piling on and piling on negative thoughts. So what we need to do is to recognize that that in fact much of the anxiety that people do have is because they get into repetitive thought patterns of wanting something that they don't have. And so when we begin to see that pattern that we're piling on, wanting something and wanting something and wanting something, we can now change that pattern to begin to interrupt that by having thoughts of I'm okay, I'm okay without that. We'll be fine even though John Joe Manchin doesn't do what we want him to do. I'll survive. I'll be okay.

**Speaker B:** So, so something that happened tonight that directly relates to this. Okay. After work, I did a seclusion session. I haven't gotten a text from my girlfriend in about maybe 2.5 hours. Okay. She was out at the movie. She was out with hers.

**Speaker A:** Gone. You lost 2.5 hours. Well, you'll never hear from her again.

**Speaker B:** I know it sounds ridiculous. Well, here's the thing. So we have a little bit of a history with her, like with drinking and being out late. She used to be a bartender. And at one point, it was a long time ago, but she was out with a guy, one of her friends. She came home very late in the night and I saw them you know, either kissing or hugging or whatever. I don't know what they were doing, but it looked like they were. And she didn't remember it at all because she was so drunk. And we weren't even dating then, but we were close to dating. And it really, really just— it hurt. It hurt a lot.

**Speaker A:** No, you hurt a lot.

**Speaker B:** I hurt a lot. Yes, I did. I heard it a lot. Yes.

**Speaker A:** And it was your choice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, see, so that's probably why I

**Speaker A:** still— And it wasn't that it hurt a lot. It's that the thought hurt. And then the thought hurt again. And then the thought hurt again. That it was the repetitive thinking about it that began to pile up the hurt.

**Speaker B:** So you're saying it's not what I saw, it's the thought that I had?

**Speaker A:** And it's the repetitive thought. It's not what you saw, it's that you saw it in your mind a thousand times after that. You repeated it over and over and over again. And every time you did, it hurt just a little bit. And so now you walk away from that whole episode saying that it hurt a lot, where really what happened is it hurt a little bit often.

**Speaker B:** I don't fully see that clearly, and

**Speaker A:** that's probably why you will when you begin to recognize that the only feelings that you can have are about the feelings that are associated with the thinking that you're having. And when you change your thought, you will change the way you feel.

**Speaker B:** Okay. So today I know, so she was out, so she was out with her sisters, right? And, you know, we live together, so we don't really go many periods throughout the day where we don't talk. So I hadn't heard back from her. I asked her what she was doing, and my mind was going, it was going like, oh, she had a party. Oh, did she drink? Is she with the guy right now? And I just noticed the thoughts, every single one, and I saw them. I saw them. I was like, ah, I see you. I see you, irritation. I see you, fear. I see you. No, I see you, anxiety. And I laid down and I sat with the sensations. I tried to move it. I did another seclusion session. I eventually just called her. Her, right? I called her, and what she told me is that she was in the movies with her sisters. It was a movie that her and I were supposed to see, so I was jealous and butthurt. And then I was going off in my head like you did. I'm like, oh, greed. Ah, oh, ill will. You want to be upset with her. I even told her on the phone, I was like, well, there was a little bit of a flame, but it's gone now. It wasn't true though. I was still a little upset. I was still hurt. But you know, because I've been developing this practice, I thought I could let it go.

**Speaker A:** No, I think that you were correct, in fact, when you told her that it wasn't anything, because in that moment it wasn't. It became something later when you started thinking about it again. Maybe, maybe you brought it back up. This is the point that we're, that we're making. It's the repetitiveness of the thought that, that gets us into bad feelings. That in fact, you mentioned that when you were thinking about where was she and what was she doing?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And you were dwelling on it.

**Speaker B:** And then after we got off the

**Speaker A:** phone— yeah, and then after I got

**Speaker B:** off the phone, I started thinking about it more, and I thought, well, wait a minute, hold on, let's stop here. You thought she was drunk, you thought she was with guys. It wasn't any of that. She was at the movies with her sisters. They got surprise tickets. It's not like she just went to the movie in spite of you. Like, chill out, dude. And then, hey, success! Congratulate yourself because you saw this. It's good that you're seeing this. Then I— and then I— and then I went downstairs and went to do my laundry, and then I noticed it was there again. I was like, ah, I see you, ill will. Like, literally wanting to question her, wanting to interrogate her, literally thinking she was lying to me, that maybe her sister didn't get her surprise tickets. Maybe they all just decided to go to the movie without me. And it was like, I was like, I see you, I see you, I see you, I see you. And I was doing it, I was doing it. But Dhammarato, it didn't, it didn't work. It didn't work to let go of it.

**Speaker A:** It worked when you were doing it. It was working when you did it, but working one time and you did it doesn't mean that you have solved the problem. As Dan had said, you've got the Eightfold Noble Path in your hip pocket, but you need it to pull out of the pocket sometimes and to plug it in. Okay, that— that's— you're giving exactly the sequence that goes. Yes, you will wake up and stop doing it, and then you can congratulate yourself for waking up and stop doing it, and then a couple of minutes later you're back into it again. That's the habit pattern of the mind. Are you going to continue that and only have occasionally waking up and feeling good and then spending most of your time back in and saying, oh well, I, I talk myself out of it and I'm back in? Of what the hell? Okay, in other words, you become a victim again. Now you're victimized by your own mind instead of, oh no, I don't have to think about my girlfriend at the movies right now. I can wait till she gets home. I can wait. I don't have to think about that. Let me think about laundry right now. Let me do an exquisite job of laundry rather than a half-assed job of laundry and a half-assed job of girlfriend.

**Speaker B:** Oh, man. But, but Dhammarato, what about when it's, it's so It's like the episodes, it's

**Speaker A:** so— No, it's not so. You're doing the 'it's so' because you're trying to describe to me how bad you feel. And the answer to that is, is the only reason that we feel bad is because we keep bumping into the same wound. We keep knocking the same wound over and over again. Better thing is to let your relationship with your girlfriend heal by stop thinking about her. Stop bumping on it. Stop this repetitive issue. Get that stuff out of your mind and start having your mind moments over and over again of the things that you like about your girlfriend. Or about how well you can handle her going to the movie. I can handle that.

**Speaker B:** So you're really saying like sometimes it just comes down to like kind of like having like a debate with that darkness, that darkness, my old friend, just having a debate with them. No, I can do that. Oh, I see you. I gotcha. Oh, I got you there too. Oh no, I see you. No, I'm okay. I don't need to think about that. Like, no matter how intense it feels here, how— no matter how intense it feels here, because it's here. It's here when it becomes the problem. It's not in my head. It's here.

**Speaker A:** Ah, but you talk yourself into those feelings. You talk yourself into those feelings, and it's done through two sets of glands, the pituitary and the pineal glands, which are in the back of the head here. And they have, let us say, a neurochemical pathway directly to the adrenaline gland. Now, the reason that the adrenaline gland is as far away from the pineal gland as it is, and this is the lymphatic system This is a communication system and it communicates through chemistry. And so the pineal gland turns on and says, okay, Mr. Adrenaline Gland, go do your thing. What does the adrenal gland do? Because that's an important point. Where is the adrenal gland? It sits on top of the liver and is beside the kidneys. The liver is that part of the body that cleans the blood. Which means that the ingredients, the magic ingredients that the adrenaline gland is going to use to manufacture the adrenaline, is coming right out of the kidneys. The poison right out of the kidneys is put together in the adrenaline gland to make, I think it's cortisol and adrenaline. Now, cortisol will stay longer in the system It builds up. But in fact, it's quite known that as people get older, cortisol builds up in the body. What that means is, is that those people who have cortisol building up in their body as they age spent a lot of their time in their earlier in their life with adrenaline in their system. But the adrenaline will break down sometimes very quickly. In fact, the adrenaline is what we need to give us the energy. It's a high-pump energy. That's why we call it anxiety and tension, is because we're wired with this extra ingredient of fuel. I mean, it's like we got high-octane gas in the engine for the moment with no place to go, all driven up, all charged up with adrenaline. That we got with spinning the mind. So when you feel anxiety, by making friends with it, you're immediately changing it so that you begin to turn that adrenaline back off again. So think of that. Every negative thought that we have will put one more drop of adrenaline in the system. And by building and by building and by building with those thoughts, one thought after another, we get very tense and uptight. We can feel it. We feel restless, we feel disturbed. We feel like we've got to go do something, that we feel, you know, agitated. You've heard all of these words. Now we're beginning to understand that we got into that state because we talked ourselves into it. And sometimes it doesn't take much, but in fact, sometimes it happens and it took whatever it took to get ourselves there. We weren't really paying attention to it. An example of that is, is that you're waiting for— this is a clear example of it— you're waiting for your wife or your husband or your mate or your daughter or someone in the family to come home, and you're getting worried about them. It's not that, oh, where's Johnny? And then an hour later, oh, where's Johnny? And then 2 hours later, oh, where's Johnny? No, it was that during that first hour, where's Johnny? Where's Johnny? Where's Johnny? Then we begin to answer that with all kinds of fantasies. Oh, he's been in a wreck. Oh, he's gotten arrested. Oh, he's in the hospital. Oh, he's this, he's that. And then the next hour we do it again. Where's Johnny? Oh well, Johnny must have gotten into the mob. Oh, Johnny's been arrested by the IRS. Oh, the bears have eaten Johnny,

**Speaker B:** you know.

**Speaker A:** Oh dear, what can the matter be? Dear, dear, what can the matter be? Johnny's so long at the fair. You hear that? Okay. And, and it's not just one thought about where's Johnny that causes the anxiety. It's the fact that we keep dwelling. Where's Johnny? Where's Johnny? Where's Johnny? And we grind it in. We turn that adrenaline tap on. One drop at a time, one drop at a time, one drop at a time, until we work ourselves up. And we don't recognize that. So now, as a meditator, you can begin to recognize, oh, I get myself into these anxiety states because I talk myself into them, which means that if I stop talking myself into anxiety, the anxiety will go away. But so long— so, oh, I'm anxious. Oh, I've got all of this anxiety. It's just the kind of thought that's going to keep the anxiety there. When we become anxious about our anxiety, that in fact someone who listens to their heartbeat— oh no, the heart, something's wrong, my heart is pounding, I can hear it so loud. Okay, if they have those kind of thoughts, their heart will pound louder. And it will have even higher blood pressure. But if they have the thought, oh well, never mind, the heart's just beating right now, let me listen to the rhythm, then they can soothe themselves back down again.

**Speaker B:** What about the anxiety? What do we say about the anxiety?

**Speaker A:** Well, the anxiety, as I said, we talk ourselves into the anxiety. And if we don't like the anxiety, we keep it going because we're doing Because the anxiety is a reflection of not liking something. So if we don't like anxiety, we're going to become anxious about our anxiety. So let us think instead the nurturing thoughts of Johnny will come home soon. I don't have to worry about him. He's a big boy. He can take care of himself. He's at the movie with his girl. Girlfriend or whatever. Just leave it alone. Don't worry about it. That in fact, the exact same thinking happened, did happen with the dog. Lucky doesn't look like she's feeling good. She did not eat supper last night. But I'm not going to worry about it because just a few minutes ago she hopped up and walked out, ran out into the yard with the other dogs. To look at something. So now that she's back mopey again, I don't care because she's already proven that she can get up and go when she wants to get up and go. And I don't have to worry about taking her to the vet. I can relax. Okay. But under other circumstances, I say, oh no, she's still sick. Oh, we've got to take her to the vet and have all of this worry and anxiety about the dog. When the dog's got no worry or anxiety. She's just doing what she wants to do. And we have projected because she didn't eat supper last night and we can see her lethargicness. Well, dogs are lethargic. They sleep all day. But this time, because I see her lethargic and she didn't eat supper last night, we can put stuff together. And begin to build up a trip. You see, this is how we do it. And every time I think about, oh, that poor dog is sick, we got to take her to the vet, that's just one more drop of adrenaline that comes into the system. Or when you're looking for somebody to come home— what about this? You keep thinking about it.

**Speaker B:** What about this?

**Speaker A:** Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Sometimes these thoughts, it's not as— it's not so It's not as simple as just seeing, oh, I'm talking myself into anxiety, there's the thought. Sometimes it's that they're seductive, they're very, um, they're very convincing.

**Speaker A:** Yes, which means that you're paying attention. Yes, but they've always seemed legitimate. You have always been a fool convinced by your own lies. Everybody's like that. There's nothing special about about you. We all talk ourselves into believing that, oh, it was right for me to be worried about Johnny. Oh, it's correct for me to be worried about the dog. That worry is exactly that repetitive negative thinking over and over and over again, which then builds up into restlessness because we're building up anxiety. That's why anxiety, or let us say worry and restlessness, are put together in the Buddhist Suttas, is because those repetitive thoughts build up into anxiety. Or we can choose to have different kinds of thoughts. Now here's the point, because I'm having

**Speaker B:** a little trouble, right?

**Speaker A:** How— here's the question: how many thoughts did you have of, oh, poor Johnny, where is Johnny? I want Johnny to come home. How many times do we have those thoughts before we wake up to where, oh, Johnny can take care of himself, I don't have to worry about him?

**Speaker B:** But Dhammarato, I woke up right away to it. I said, oh, I don't— I see that. No, no, I don't want to do that.

**Speaker A:** How do you know? How do you know that you woke up to it immediately? When you woke up, you woke up to what was happening right then. But what were you doing 3 or 4 minutes before that? We have to give ourselves the benefit of the doubt that we're not mindful all the time.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Because this is a new skill that we're developing, and that is okay that you're not mindful because you never have been and you survived. But now we're improving things. You're becoming mindful. And so we're waking up, and when we wake up, we wake up to what's happening right now. And so now is the time to change the repetitive thoughts. Over and over again, you'll begin to see that it wasn't just one thought about the girlfriend and where is she, is that you had that same thought over and over and over and over again. You were dwelling on it. You were worried about her. And it was the worrying about or the repetitive thoughts over and over again that caused anxiety. Such as now it can be just one. Here's an example of just one thought. You're on the way to an interview, you're driving your car to the interview, and immediately you are halfway to the new office. You realize that you haven't brought your resume or something critically important. Maybe you forgot your cell phone and that means that you can't get into the building, or you forgot your ID or something like that. And here you are driving, going to a very important event like an appointment for an interview, and you have lost something or that you didn't bring something that was a key ingredient. Another example would be that you're going to make a presentation and you forgot to bring the PowerPoint or you forgot to bring your laptop, you know, this kind of thing. And that's just one thought. And that's enough to start that anxiety then. So now the way that I would have done it years ago is that I would have turned around the car and raced back to the house to get the item that I had left and then raced back to all the way to try to make up for the time that it took that I had lost because I had forgotten the item. Yeah. Okay. Making the entire road dangerous for everybody, including me, because I'm so uptight and anxious and in a hurry that I'm driving too fast for conditions.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And the real conditions is not the conditions on the road. The real conditions is the condition in the mind of I'm in a hurry, I'm anxious, I'm Uptight. OK, but the anxious and the uptightness continue on because I continue while I'm driving the car back to the house. I'm thinking about, oh, I'm going to be late. Oh, I've got to go get that thing. Oh, this is terrible. And those kind of thoughts over and over and over again work that anxiety up and keep it going. But when we can start to see, oh, wait a minute, I'm going to be late for that meeting and that's okay. I can explain to them that I forgot something and I turned around and went to get it and I'll be all right. I can handle it. Or we can say, I can go ahead and go do that meeting and it's okay that I didn't bring the stuff. We'll send it to them later. Okay, so in other words, we begin to convince ourselves back again with repeating it over and over again. Everything's going to be all right. I'll be able to make this trip. I can go home and get the item, and I can drive safely. But I have to keep remembering that, because otherwise I'm going to get myself back up into— tied into knots because I forgot something.

**Speaker B:** So you're really saying that the power is in repeating the wholesome thought exchange,

**Speaker A:** as opposed to taking the power away from the repeating unwholesome thoughts that have the power of making us feel bad. Is how do we spend this mind moment?

**Speaker B:** So I think this probably makes sense, right? Because thoughts are faster than feelings.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely.

**Speaker B:** So exactly, if I'm having an anxiety thought, I can bet my bottom dollar that I'm going to feel it here, right?

**Speaker A:** Eventually, within— if you're awake, right? Right. But, or you can run around tense and anxious and driving your car fast and not even know it, right?

**Speaker B:** Right. No, I mean, I don't know if you remember me telling you, but for the past 2 years, all I've been doing is allowing experience, allowing feelings, concentrating on it, focusing on them, noticing them, seeing them. So I've cultivated a lot of seeing with it. So I don't think there's ever really much of a second where I don't know what I'm feeling. Maybe not. Maybe, okay, maybe, maybe not that good. But about 90 to 95%, I probably, I'm pretty aware of my feelings. But what you're saying is that when I have a negative or unwholesome thought, that most likely is going to create something manifested in the body. So and it's going to come after that thought. Now that's important to get, because if I then start— if I catch it early and start saying positive, wholesome thoughts, like, I can do this, like, or even this could be one, right? Oh, I see you. I see you. Like, that could be a wholesome thought.

**Speaker A:** That is a wholesome thought. Okay, exactly.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I see you. Oh, I'm glad. Okay, I concentrated on seeing what I'm seeing, and I acknowledge myself for it. There's another one. Oh, okay. So we're capitalizing on what can I find about this moment to congratulate myself on, to find success with, to appreciate, so that that feeling eventually is going to rewind itself back and out of my body. Like it's going to resolve itself.

**Speaker A:** It does, right? And the question is, Well, how long does it take to come out of the body has to do with how much of it that we have built up while we were not mindful. So unmindful and drip, and unmindful and drip, and it starts to build up. And then we can see, wow, look how— and it's just thought. Let me change the thought. And now I'm having happy-go-lucky thoughts, and now it begins to dwindle back down again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that was happening today.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so an example of that would be a top or a gyroscope or something like that. You know that we spend the time winding it up with the thoughts and then we pull the string and the thing just spins and spins. But if we don't keep putting more energy into it, it will spin down. Okay, so the same thing happens with the adrenaline. The adrenaline will spin down if we stop giving it any juice.

**Speaker B:** Okay, can you hold on one second, Dhammarato? I'll be right back, one second. Okay, so, all right, so That being said, I have a question. Is—

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Is Does this process of waking up and becoming more mindful of your moment-to-moment experience cause feelings, certain feelings that maybe weren't there before or noticed as much, to come up?

**Speaker A:** When we begin to investigate, we begin to see things that weren't— we didn't see before, and we see what was there in new ways. That's the answer to that question, that as we investigate, we will see things that we didn't see before. And one of the things that I'm inviting you to do now is to investigate how repetitive thoughts, unwholesome repetitive thoughts, build up anxiety. Just like thinking about, where's the girlfriend? Where's the girlfriend? Where's the girlfriend? Is like one more drop of adrenaline, one more drop of adrenaline, one more drop of adrenaline. That's what we're putting in, is that's the thing that you begin to see, is that my negative thoughts influence how I feel one drop at a time until I can work myself up into feeling bad. If that's the case, then wholesome thoughts means that I can have one wholesome thought after another, and the drops of dopamine the drops of whatever is the anti-adrenaline. In fact, I think the anti-adrenaline is merely the lack of the adrenaline.

**Speaker B:** Hey baby, my girlfriend just got home. Oh, that's so sweet. Thank you. Do you want to meet Dhammarato? This is Abby.

**Speaker A:** Hello, Abby.

**Speaker B:** Oh, he says hi. Okay, she also is a good friend of Dan's.

**Speaker A:** Good. Yes.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I'll be out a little bit, babe.

**Speaker A:** So, all right, well, I'll let you go. Let's stay with this one point then, as you begin to see that that you talk yourself into the way that you feel, that it's not just necessarily or generally one word, that it's the fact that we keep thinking about it over and over again, and that you can interrupt that at any time.

**Speaker B:** Okay, good. And how does this fit into the WOW practice that I've been doing with noticing the present moment?

**Speaker A:** But that's the way of talking yourself into the wow. Which would you do? Would you rather talk yourself into the wow or talk yourself into, oh no, my girlfriend's gone to the movie and I'm stuck? Okay. Which one? Your choice.

**Speaker B:** Present moment. Present moment. For sure.

**Speaker A:** Present moment. Being joyful and happy will take you into that wow state. But then the wow. Relaxes.

**Speaker B:** Now, what about what I could imagine here as a possibility is that in looking at the anxiety and looking at how it starts as one thought may require or may bring on anxiety in a way.

**Speaker A:** Me, right?

**Speaker B:** Because I'm coming face to face with it. I'm choosing to stare at, you know,

**Speaker A:** if you don't like it, if you

**Speaker B:** don't like it, which that— I mean, how do you like anxiety? How do I like my anxiety?

**Speaker A:** Well, you like it in the sense of you recognize that you can see it, as opposed to having it grab you and you have been— now you're the victim of it. Are you going to be the victim of this anxiety? Are you going to be the champion of it?

**Speaker B:** Well, I was experiencing that today where I could be, ah, irritation. I like seeing irritation. It's not so bad. Now I got to work on that with anxiety. But what's the next part of that?

**Speaker A:** You don't have to worry about the next part. It'll take care of itself if you keep having wholesome thoughts one after another. This is actually a very simple process.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And it gives really good results in a hurry. Okay. It's only because meditators are practicing wrongly and not getting rid of these unwholesome thoughts that their meditation practice takes years and years, because they haven't gotten this one point. This one point is, is that we have to come out of the repetitive unwholesome thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** That's what the whole business of the dark night of the soul is, is when you give yourself a whole lot of really negative thoughts while you're being very, very mindful of all of these negative thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Well, see, that's so interesting because I've heard people talk about the dark night of the soul like it's a necessary and essential part of the path, that

**Speaker A:** deep pain— if you wind up in the ditch, if you keep winding up in the ditch over and over again, you begin to get the idea that, hey, I'm a success at getting in the ditch. It must be an important part of the path.

**Speaker B:** Okay, that's happened for me many times.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, that's something that Dan Ingram and I were discussing on the Guru Viking, but we didn't get that point across so well. But he's made it before, another point, other times, and that is that the Dark Night of the Soul is optional. It depends upon how you're practicing. The longer and the longer you practice, the more likely you are going to have not just one but multiple dark nights of the soul, because you're not taking these unwholesome thoughts out of the mind, but you're developing the skill of Sati. So you're really good at seeing the garbage, but you're not good at removing, removing the repetitive nature of it.

**Speaker B:** It.

**Speaker A:** Huh. Huh. That in fact there is no place in any of the suttas anywhere that talks about a dark night of the soul. The word, the whole concept, is a Christian concept. And Christians have a very good reason for having dark nights of the soul, and that is because they trusted in God. They had a friend called Jesus They trusted in Jesus to get their troubles finished, and Jesus didn't do the job for them. If Jesus doesn't do the job for them, then who can they get to do it? And so they go into the dark night of the soul of failure because, number one, they don't have the ability to come out of their sin by themselves. And number two, God's not doing his job. God has forsaken me. Oh my God. 'Why hast thou forsaken me?' is in fact the dark night of the soul. But the very famous nun named— she's called Mother Teresa. Years after she died, her memoirs came out to show that she was in a long-term dark night of the soul, and that directly influenced how she spent the money that was donated to her when she became famous, that in fact she was there to help the poor in Calcutta. But when she got a huge amount of money, she didn't help the poor in Calcutta. She said, oh, their suffering is beneficial for their spiritual growth, just like all of my suffering is beneficial for my spiritual growth. So what does she do? She goes and builds a nunnery in her own name so that she can get a whole bunch of other nuns to go suffer as much as she suffered.

**Speaker B:** Wow, wow.

**Speaker A:** And they canonized her for that. But she had quite a number of people, uh, journalists in fact, who were pointing out what was really going on. Uh, what was his name? Um, oh, he's still alive. Uh, no, Christopher Hitchin. That's the guy. He's just died, I think, but he was very— he wrote books about her. But anyway, here's the dark night of the soul. Whether it's Saint John of the Cross or a Christian, the dark night of the soul comes to those kind of people. The meditator doesn't have that, that the meditator, even if he has a kind of a mini dark night of the soul, the point of it is, is that it redoubles his effort. To remove the hindrances.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, yes. Okay, I understand. So, I mean, haven't you— I mean, I'm sure you've heard of this. Haven't you ever heard of like, you know, enlightenment is all about going through all of your pain? You'll cry all your tears. You'll go through all of your disillusionment, your disorientation, your— you know, there can

**Speaker A:** be such a— haven't you already done that? When are you going to get over that? How long do you have to go into that kind of crap before you give it up? What is your rock bottom?

**Speaker B:** Well, that's what I'm wondering. Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** My rock bottom is just the surface. As soon as I hit the surface, I don't have to go all the way to the rock bottom. I can just say, wait a minute, that's enough. I just hit the Dukkha. Let me not go into it any deeper than this. So

**Speaker B:** It's just, this boggles my mind because I was with someone for about a year and a half to 2 years on the Discord server. And he expressed pretty, pretty heavily that it is all about allowing your internal experience, everything. You must allow your resistance, must allow your hatred, must allow your sadness.

**Speaker A:** That's what everybody else, that's what everybody, that's all the ordinary people. So he's giving you ordinary people's advice that ordinary people do all the time, and they continue their suffering. When are you going to stop doing it?

**Speaker B:** Well, no, the distinction is that most people suppress those things. Most people ignore their pain. They suppress or are ignorant to their sadness, to their depression, to their hatred. To their arrogance. They're not honest about it with themselves or with other people. So you see, okay, I understand.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I have a little story about that.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** So imagine that you're standing on the highway, okay, and you look down the road and you see a big truck, a semi or a lorry or something like that. And not only that, but he's blowing his horn, here I come. You have 3 choices. One choice is the choice that you're talking about now. I see that truck coming and I'm going to stand there and let it run over me. That means that I've got 2 problems. One is, is that I got hit by the truck. And number 2, I had the anxiety of getting hit by the truck before I saw it. And it may have been better for that truck to have hit me having even seen it come. There's another possibility, and that is what I call Popeye. We instantly grab a can of, I guess, power juice or spinach or something, and then we try to stop that thought. And it runs over us anyway. Okay, this is the hardcore, really struggling meditation. Okay, and that doesn't work either. But in fact, it's better to just let it run over you rather than getting a really strong stance so that when it does run over you, you really get hurt, right? Okay. All right. But there's a third way, and that's the way of the Buddha, and that is the third way is just to step out of the road, let it miss you.

**Speaker B:** So is everything that I've been taught a lie?

**Speaker A:** Mostly, yes. And that's something that we have to come to conclusion about, that in fact the Buddha talks about that. And the Pali word for it is sila bhanta paramasa. Sila bhanta paramasa means that we attach to rights, rules, and rituals that basically wound up being lies. Okay, any rule that is passed will find exceptions to it. This is why people want mercy from the court, and there's all of that kind of stuff. This is one of the main reasons why so many people are against capital punishment, is because once you kill someone, you can't undo the damage that you've done to them. You can put somebody in 30 years in jail and then let him out, and if he was really free, and you might give him $1 million or $2 million for his effort. But if you killed somebody and he was innocent— and now they're beginning to understand that maybe 20% or more of the people on death row are innocent. And so, that's the issue. So, coming around to that, most people— and by the way, there's an issue about that point about suppression. We do not suppress feelings, we suppress behavior. You cannot suppress feelings. We do suppress behavior. An example is you see two guys fighting. Let us say that for some reason you're in a bar and now you have a bar fight. What are you going to do about it? Normally people will say, well, I'm going to put a stop to that bar fight and I'm going to just get right in the middle of it. If you walk into another fight, you're going to get hit. If you try to break up two dogs from fighting, one of them, even your dog, is going to bite you. Okay, so we suppress that and we stay out of that fight, but we still have a lot of feelings about it. Right? Okay. Now, back in the 1970s, when all of this issue about suppression got started, this stuff came from a very famous psychiatrist called— his name was Fritz Perls, and he was at the Esalen Institute. He was very famous. He was the one who had the empty chair where no one's there, but you talk to the chair. So you have three chairs. You have the therapist, you have the client, you have the empty chair, and the client then talks to the person that they are having trouble with in their mind, and they put an image of them in that chair and have a talk with mommy or whatever. That deteriorated into pillow bashing, that if the guy is really angry at his mom and he's got to let that anger out, and so he bashes the pillow. Oh, I hate you, Mom. You were so terrible to me. Okay. That then evolved into the next thing, which was eventually they called them encounter groups. And there was a whole industry that was built up with batons and heavy gloves, boxing mitts, helmets, all the kinds of stuff that you would see in a boxing ring for training boxers. But they were bringing all of this equipment into the psychologist therapy office for people to stop suppressing their feelings, thinking that it was anger. Or maybe they would— another example of that is having a whole box of Kleenex anicca, Anapanasati, Anicca, Anagami, 5 packs per session, so that the woman, the client, is going to just cry and cry and cry and cry and cry and let it out. Another example of that, stop suppressing your feelings. Here's what happened with that: People were getting angry in the encounter groups and going home and starting up new domestic violence. People who were not violent before became violent. They started the violence in their therapy session, getting permission and protection from the therapist. In other words, they were bringing on a new mommy into their mind, saying that it's OK to be violent in the therapy session. Therefore, it's OK to go home and be violent. There is no call. OK to be violent with the cops. OK to be violent with your boss. It doesn't matter. Let your feelings out. Don't suppress. Funny thing, the psychologist figured that out by 1980, and that whole business of encounter group equipment Anagami went out of business. Nobody uses that stuff anymore. But the new modern group of young people have been left with this word called suppression, thinking that, oh, you're not supposed to suppress your feelings. To where in fact, that's exactly what we want to do. We want to suppress these feelings. And the best way to suppress them is to stop giving them the energy that keeps them going. We do want to suppress our behavior. If you have the thought, oh, I hate that guy and I want to kill him, we need to suppress those kinds of behaviors. If we see a bauble in the Walmart and we think that it's too expensive, maybe it's batteries or maybe it's a microchip or something small like that. And so we have the thought, well, I'll just put it in my pocket. All right, we need to suppress those kind of behaviors.

**Speaker B:** I've also heard that feeling is healing, allowing your feeling, allowing yourself to fully experience that feeling and those sensations.

**Speaker A:** And then what, get over it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no, let it— well, let it go. Well, let it go. Do it again.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the whole point, that that doesn't work. That in fact, if you— how to say it— if you practice something over and over again, you'll get fairly good at it. And we are all very good at feeling bad because we've been doing it over and over again.

**Speaker B:** This is interesting because the friend that I'm telling you about, who I've been studying basically for the past year and a half, what he did did is he went through all of his misery, all of his pain, until he got very, very, very tired of it. And then once he got so tired of it, one day it was gone. So it's interesting.

**Speaker A:** Here's a question, here's a question for you. How long is it going to take for you to get tired of it? Exactly, exactly. How long is it going to take before you said, I've got enough of this? You're right. And then start to make a change. You don't have to go to rock bottom to do that. You can begin to wake up to the Dukkha quickly. You don't have to wallow in it. You don't have to go so deep into it that it stares you in the face. You can see it at a distance and avoid it at a distance.

**Speaker B:** And through that process, you can still wake up. You can still let go of the illusion, illusioned self, you can still— way

**Speaker A:** of saying it is— no, no, no, no, no, that's not the way to look at it.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** That in fact, the correct way to say it is, is that so long as someone is letting their feelings out, they're not making any progress. Why don't you start making some real progress right away? How long does a boat have to be sailing along before the captain recognizes that all the anchor has been weighed and I've been dragging the anchor across the bottom of the ocean, slowing us down all this time? How long does he have to do it? Does he have to go all the way through the whole journey? And then lift the anchor when it's time to set it down. How long are you going to drag this crap around?

**Speaker B:** So what about this whole— like, and I don't really think about this that much, I don't really look at this that much because it's not really useful, but like self-realization and stream entry and, um, and, uh, what do they call it?

**Speaker A:** These are all attainments that people have to get over wanting. You have to stop wanting that stuff.

**Speaker B:** I know, no, I know, I understand. But this person that I'm talking about that did a conversely different approach to what you're sharing with me had these— has these attainments. In his own experience, he said he has gotten these attainments, but he doesn't describe it as an attainment. It's— he says actually, like, describing as an attainment is the problem, like what you're saying, the wanting. It's a byproduct of the process. It's not, uh, it's not a means. It's not a means to— it's not

**Speaker A:** like— so ask, instead of continuing on trying to convince me that he did the right thing, I'm not trying— he was successful at it. Ask yourself, do you want to go through the same mess that he went through? I don't. I don't. And how long are you going to stay in your mess before you recognize that you've had enough of it?

**Speaker B:** I've had enough of it now.

**Speaker A:** All right. Well, this is the issue about basically mentioning this. The Dark Night of the Soul immediately brings up the 16 stages of insight. Which is something that's out of the 5th century AD from the Visuddhimagga. Perhaps you know about the 16 stages of insight to where— No. Step 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 are that sequence that we're talking about here. And that is the meditator sees the fear. He sees the fearfulness. He sees his own misery. He sees his disgust. He sees his great desire to get out of this.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And then he makes the strong determination that he is going to get out of this. And that strong determination to get out of that means that now he's going to start practicing correctly to remove the unwholesome thoughts that are causing it. Now here's the point: if the students are not taught correctly, that means that it's possible for them to go 20 years slowly going into the Dark Night of the Soul, and that the Dark Night of the Soul is not necessary at all. The question is, when can you wake up to the Dukkha and then put a stop to it? Are you— how long do you have to dwell on it? And if you have the idea, oh, I have to fully experience it, all of that, then that's a long, slow, difficult process.

**Speaker B:** So you're saying stage 8— would you say you said stage 8 through 11 is the process in which the meditator wakes up and realizes that he's going to put an end to. He's going to put an end basically to this process that we do to ourselves.

**Speaker A:** Right. And so why don't we start that way? Why do we have to spend 20 years in meditation before we figure out that what we've been doing all along in our meditation is not removing the hindrances?

**Speaker B:** Well, what is stage 1 through 7?

**Speaker A:** Um, really not so important, but in fact it only gets important in Step 12. And Step 12 is the real doozy. What is Step 12? Is, um, the Eightfold Noble Path, which is basically where we start in the Mahasi Method. Said it's 20 years into your meditation practice before you ever start for the Eightfold Noble Path and the Four Noble Truths, rather than starting at that. Okay, see the Dukkha and throw it out, remove it, get rid of it.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay. And then what is, what is 13 through 16?

**Speaker A:** Well, number 16 is especially important because 16, which seems to be the end of it is actually a place to begin, and that is ongoing investigation to find out what's left. Well, that's where we should be getting. So doing it in a particular order is not very useful or valuable.

**Speaker B:** Ah, okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** That in fact there's a much more natural approach or a natural way of doing it. And you can already— you've gotten enough of what we're talking about here to recognize, no, this is the better way to do it.

**Speaker B:** I know.

**Speaker A:** Well, in those bad feelings, let's start cleaning them out instead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay. All right, awesome. Okay, well, I'm gonna let you get to that call.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, we'll talk to you later then.

**Speaker B:** All right, thanks, Dhammarato. Appreciate you.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay, okay, we'll see you. Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a student named Anicca (Speaker B), focuses on a pivotal shift in meditation practice: moving from **struggling against** negative mental states to **making friends with them**.

Here is a summary of the key themes and progression:

### Core Insight & Practice Shift
The student reports a breakthrough after being advised to **"make irritation my friend."** Instead of resisting or trying to escape feelings of irritation, anxiety, or doubt, he learns to:
*   **Acknowledge them playfully:** "Wow, irritation. I see you."
*   **Engage with bodily sensations:** Experiment by "playing" with the physical feeling, trying to move it around, or "making it dance."
*   **Change the relationship:** See these states not as enemies to defeat, but as phenomena to observe with curiosity and compassion.

### Results of the New Approach
The student experiences significant changes:
*   **Reduced Intensity:** Irritation and anxiety become more subtle and gentle.
*   **Increased Sustainability:** Wholesome thoughts and good feelings begin to sustain themselves throughout the day, similar to the calm after deep meditation.
*   **Compassion:** More compassion for himself and his experience arises.
*   **Shift from "Escape" to "Joy":** Dhammarato reframes this as moving from **Right Effort as an escape** (the struggle of a victim) to the **joy of having a correctly functioning mind**. Practice becomes a positive pursuit, not a frantic avoidance.

### The Mechanism: Repetition of Thought
Dhammarato explains the underlying psychology:
*   **The Power of Repetition:** Mental states gain their power and intensity through the **repetitive piling on of thoughts**. One anxious thought is a drop of adrenaline; dwelling on it creates a flood.
*   **We Talk Ourselves Into States:** Anxiety, worry, and hurt are built by repeating negative storylines in the mind (e.g., "Where is she?" "That hurt me.").
*   **The Practice is Interruption:** The core skill is to **interrupt unwholesome repetitive thoughts** and consciously choose to repeat wholesome ones (e.g., "I'm okay," "Present moment," "I see you"). This starves the negative state of energy.

### Practical Application & Challenges
The student provides a real-time example: anxiety about his girlfriend being out late. He successfully uses the "I see you" technique but finds the old thought patterns seductive and repetitive.
*   Dhammarato's advice: **Congratulate yourself for waking up to the pattern each time.** Don't expect one interruption to solve it forever. Gently but persistently redirect attention to the present task (e.g., doing laundry well) instead of feeding the worry story.

### Critique of Common Misconceptions
Dhammarato strongly challenges several popular meditation ideas:
*   **"The Dark Night of the Soul":** He argues this is **optional** and stems from incorrect practice that develops mindfulness (*sati*) without removing unwholesome thoughts. It's a Christian concept, not a Buddhist one.
*   **"You Must Fully Feel/Allow All Pain":** He critiques the idea that healing requires wallowing in or "letting out" negative feelings (like rage or tears). He argues this just reinforces the habit of feeling bad. The Buddha's way is to **"step out of the road"**—to see the suffering (*dukkha*) and stop feeding it through repetitive thought, not to let it run you over.
*   **The 16 Stages of Insight (Visuddhimagga):** He suggests this traditional map can be inefficient, putting the crucial insight (that we must stop creating our own *dukkha*) at stage 8-11, after years of practice. His approach is to start with that insight immediately.

### Conclusion: The Path Forward
The talk concludes by emphasizing:
*   **Confidence (*Shraddha*):** Developing trust in your ability to do this, moving from a victim's mindset to a winner's mindset.
*   **Simplicity:** The process is simple (though not easy): spot unwholesome repetition, interrupt it, choose a wholesome thought, and repeat that.
*   **Immediacy:** You don't have to hit "rock bottom" or endure years of purification. You can start disentangling yourself from suffering **now** by changing your relationship to thoughts and feelings.

**In essence,** the talk is a guide to transforming one's inner life from a battlefield into a space of mindful, playful observation, where the power of repetitive thought is harnessed for well-being rather than suffering.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, here are the primary **metaphors and stories** used in the talk to illustrate the teachings on meditation, mindfulness, and dealing with difficult mental states:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Playing in a Puddle:** Speaker B uses this to describe the initial, experimental approach to working with irritation—splashing around, trying things out without a fixed plan, learning through playful interaction with the sensation.

2.  **The New Bird with Tired Wings:** Speaker A uses this to normalize Speaker B's fatigue after intense practice. The "new bird" has just learned to fly (use new mental skills) and its unfamiliar wings are tired—it's a natural part of the learning process, not a failure.

3.  **Joy of Running vs. Escaping:** Speaker A contrasts two modes of "right effort." Initially, it's like the exhausting effort of *escaping from* a threat (Dukkha). With progress, it becomes the *joy of running*—the pleasure of a mind functioning correctly and freely.

4.  **Bumping Your Elbow:** Used to illustrate how we cause our own suffering through repetition. If it hurts every time you bump your elbow, the solution is simple: stop bumping it. Similarly, if repetitive negative thoughts cause anxiety, stop repeating them.

5.  **Boat Navigation:** The problem isn't that other boats are in your water; it's that you're not steering your own boat (mind) attentively. You've been in control (of your thoughts) all along but didn't know it.

6.  **Piling On / Giving Weight:** Negative or positive mind states gain "weight" and power through repetition. Unwholesome thoughts pile up like bricks, creating heaviness (anxiety). Wholesome thoughts can be piled up just the same to create stability and joy.

7.  **Noise vs. Music:** The repetitive piling on of "junk" thoughts (complaints, judgments) is just **noise**. The rhythmic, intentional piling on of wholesome thoughts is like **music**.

8.  **The Wound & The Bump:** Anxiety or hurt is like a wound. We keep "bumping" it (revisiting the painful thought) and then wonder why it still hurts. Healing comes from stopping the repetitive bumping.

9.  **The Spinning Top / Gyroscope:** Negative thoughts wind up our anxiety like pulling the string on a top. If we stop adding energy (more negative thoughts), it will naturally spin down and come to rest.

10. **The Adrenaline Tap / Drip System:** Each unwholesome thought is like one **drop** of adrenaline (or cortisol) added to the system. Repetitive worrying is like leaving the tap on, drip by drip, until you've worked yourself into a state of anxiety.

11. **Dragging an Anchor:** Holding onto negative patterns while trying to make progress is like sailing a boat while dragging its anchor across the ocean floor. It slows you down immensely, and the solution is to simply lift the anchor (stop the negative pattern).

12. **The Three Ways with the Truck (Story-Metaphor):** Speaker A presents a three-option story to critique common approaches to difficult emotions:
    *   **Option 1 (Allowing/Being Run Over):** See the truck (negative emotion) coming and just let it hit you. This results in both the impact and the anticipatory anxiety.
    *   **Option 2 (Suppression/Popeye):** See the truck, tense up massively, and try to stop it by force. It runs you over anyway, and you're more hurt from the rigid resistance.
    *   **Option 3 (The Buddha's Way/Stepping Aside):** Simply see the truck and step out of the road. Let the negative thought pattern pass by without engaging with it or becoming its victim.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Story of Speaker B's Girlfriend:** This is the central, real-life story used to deconstruct anxiety and jealousy. Speaker B narrates his process of noticing anxious thoughts about his girlfriend being out, applying his "making friends" practice, and then seeing the thoughts return. The dialogue uses this story to explore how repetitive thought patterns, not the external event, create and sustain suffering.

2.  **The Story of Spontaneous Cancer Remission:** Used to illustrate the profound physical impact of a radical change in attitude and thinking, suggesting that the mind can talk itself into or out of illness.

3.  **The Political Rant Example (Joe Manchin):** A modern anecdote to illustrate how millions of people spin their minds in repetitive, negative, and ultimately powerless thought patterns about political figures, creating personal anxiety that changes nothing externally.

4.  **The Forgotten Resume / Presentation:** A relatable story about the single thought ("I forgot my laptop!") that can trigger immediate anxiety, and the two possible paths: fueling it with more frantic thoughts or interrupting the cycle with calming, wholesome ones.

5.  **The Dog (Lucky) Story:** Speaker A uses his own experience with his lethargic dog to show how he could choose to build a "trip" of worry and anxiety through repetitive negative projection, or choose to interrupt that pattern based on evidence (the dog ran outside when it wanted to).

6.  **The Mother Teresa Anecdote:** Used to trace the origin and potential pitfalls of the "Dark Night of the Soul" concept. The story suggests her prolonged personal suffering (dark night) led to a philosophy that justified not alleviating the suffering of others.

7.  **The 1970s Encounter Group Story:** An anecdote from psychology history to argue against the idea that one must "let feelings out" or "not suppress." The story concludes that this approach often led to increased violence, and the equipment for "pillow bashing" therapy fell out of use because the method was flawed.

### **Summary**
The talk is rich with figurative language. The **metaphors** (puddle, bird, anchor, truck, etc.) are primarily **tools for understanding** psychological processes—making the abstract (mind habits, anxiety) concrete and relatable. The **stories and anecdotes** (girlfriend, cancer, politics, dog, therapy history) serve as **evidence and cautionary tales**, grounding the teachings in real-world scenarios and historical context to persuade the listener of their validity and practicality.
