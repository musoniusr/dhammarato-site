### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Uh, since you, uh, you say your name, uh, yeah, okay, uh, Ashiya, the— you, you've been listening to some of the videos already, so that means that we can sort of skip forward just a little bit. And so where we can skip forward to is actually right into the Eightfold Noble method and start looking at it that way because you've already started some practice. So the very first and most important skill is Sati, to wake up, to literally to be here in the present moment is what that means. Now you can be sitting and studying and somebody could walk in the room and say they want to sharpen their pencil, do you have a pencil sharpener? That at that point you have to come out of whatever you were doing before, reading a book, studying, worrying about the past or the future or whatever. And everybody comes into the here-now quite often. There's all kinds of triggers and things like that. But coming into the present is not enough. That in fact there's a strong coming into presence and then a weak coming into the present moment. And most of us do it kind of absent-mindedly, like you would say to the guy who was looking for the pencil sharpener, 'Oh, it's over there,' and that's all the attention you pay to it, and then you go right back to whatever you were doing before. Okay, if you were completely mindful in that case, that you would stand up walk over to the pencil sharpener and say, hand me the pencil and I'll sharpen it for you. That's when you're really awake. So this is the first point, is that there's a weak coming into the present moment and a strong coming into the present moment, developing it as a skill so that when you do wake up and come into the present moment, you really come into the present moment. Right. And so we start paying attention then to that coming into the present moment with gusto. We come into the present moment as if you were waking up after a very, very long sleep and you're very happy to be alive.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Because in fact, having thoughts about the past, having thoughts about school that's going to give you anxiety, that's kind of a death. And when you wake up into the fully present moment, that's like becoming alive. And so we need to really, really wake up so that we can then do the investigation that we need to do. Okay. And so those are two points on the Eightfold Noble Path, or the Eightfold Noble Method, that is common in most meditations, but they don't make a point point of how important it is to really fully wake up, to really come into the present moment rather than sort of doing it slapdash, like the example of the guy wanting the pencil sharpener. Or another example of that is the student who is sitting there doing his homework, let us say, writing some code on his laptop in his bedroom. His dad comes into the room, maybe opens the door and comes right in and says good night to his son. His son is so absorbed in the code that he doesn't pay any attention to his dad at all. Yeah, right. He does not wake up to the fact that his dad is there to give him some love, and so he does not return that love, and that ticks the dad off. Yeah, he does not get the response from his son that he actually deserves. Why? Because the son did not wake up into the reality of the moment. Yes, still caught in his mental state about writing code that hasn't even run on the computer yet, or he's debugging something or whatever like that, but he's not in a real world right now. He's in his thought world, he and just the computer, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and I actually had a situation like that.

**Speaker B:** Paying attention. All right, this is also the reason why automobile accidents are so high, is because people are not actually paying attention to their driving. That when we first learn how to drive, we pay close attention to it because we got to learn how to manipulate everything. But then after we learn how to operate the clutch and the gas and the steering wheel and the brakes and all of that kind of stuff, Then we kind of put it into memory and operate the car on automatic pilot. A really, really good driver is going to be paying attention to the road. Yeah. And in fact, one of the jokes that I know about is, is that very, very wealthy people who have a chauffeur, they want a particular kind of person who had— for being their chauffeur. You know what they want? They want race car drivers.

**Speaker A:** Hmm.

**Speaker B:** Why do they want race car drivers? Because if a race car driver has raced enough and then retired and survived being a race car driver, that means he knows how to pay attention to the road. Mm-hmm. Why? Because when you're racing, you really got to pay attention. If you don't, you're going to die.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so there are various skills that we can learn that's going to help us to wake up, to be in the present moment. And those skills then can be very, very useful for people who practice meditation. Martial arts is a good one. Why? Because if you're thinking about Aunt Susie while you're in a match, you're going to get your face busted. But if you're right there for it, you're watching what's going on, then you can counter with anything that goes because you're there in that present moment.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And this has to be stressed because most people don't get the concept. Yeah, I'm in the present moment because I'm listening to what's happening, but then they're not because they're back and forth. And what we need to learn is to keep coming back because the habits are that you're going to go back into the past. And so you have to keep coming back intentionally, coming back to the present moment to see what things are going on. Which is the second item on the Eightfold Noble Path, to really take a look at what's happening. And that means that we need to use all six senses. Then in fact, you could kind of take an inventory. Mm-hmm. How's my breathing? How's my anxiety? How is my depression? How is my thoughts? What am I thinking about? Can I think better thoughts than this? So now we're beginning. Can I think better thoughts than this, or can I make the body more comfortable? Yeah, that if we wake up and check out the body, we'll find out, well, maybe the left hip is sore in the chair because we've been sitting so long. So all I need to do then is rearrange so that I can get comfortable again. This is the quality, is that we're looking for comfort.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And if you cannot gain comfort, we need to look at what's the reason why we can't be comfortable. And one of the main things in Western society is that we've got something to do. And the bottom line of it is, is that there is something to be afraid of. Yeah, so we are resistant to writing an email that we know that we have to write, but we don't want to write it. And now we're in a state of struggle because I've got afraid if I don't write that email, something bad is going to happen, but I don't really want to write it anyway. Okay, and so when that kind of stuff happens over and over again, that's what anxiety actually is, is fear. And depression is trying to get rid of that fear. In other words, let's turn this machine off because it's running too fast.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** That's why depression and anxiety— they've actually found that they're the same thing. It's the same mechanism, that everybody who is depressed also has anxiety, and anybody who has anxiety also has depression. They look differently clinically, but it's the same mechanisms inside the mind. Yeah. Okay. And the mechanisms inside the mind means that we are thinking unwholesome thoughts that make us afraid, brings up fear, brings up adrenaline, brings up anxiety, brings up all of this stuff. And many people have those things on a regular basis, but they don't know it. Mm-hmm. Only when you go to the doctor and complain about this, that, and the other thing is when you're going to get diagnosed.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And then sold some pills.

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker B:** But basically, the right cure for depression and anxiety is wake up and take a look at what you're doing and stop doing that. That's the right effort again, to wake up and take a look and then make a change. The right noble effort is to make a change out of the unwholesome into the wholesome.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** So this is what has to be practiced over and over again. And so then the students will say, well, I don't even know what the difference is between wholesome and unwholesome. And the correct answer to that is, is it's a skill to be developed. That, uh, you can ask somebody, do you like jazz or do you like classical music? Well, if he's skilled in classical music, then he'll like that more. But if he's skilled in jazz, then he'll like that more. And how it's skilled in, in that kind of music or the other is because we pay attention to it, we listen to it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, we know what to look for too.

**Speaker B:** And we know what to look for, right? So in this understanding of what is unwholesome and wholesome, it goes into 3 groups. Things that are absolutely beyond a shadow of a doubt are unwholesome. And when I recommend, or when I mention some of these, you'll say, yeah, that's for sure unwholesome. You'll agree with me, but you haven't really looked at it before. Mm-hmm. Okay. And then there are things that are absolutely wholesome, without a doubt. We know that those things are wholesome, but we don't think of it in the sense of, oh, well, I should stop having unwholesome thoughts and start having wholesome thoughts. Yeah. And then the third category is the big one, and that is the something that's in between, that the beginner thinks that is wholesome when in fact it's not wholesome. And so as we build our skills of discrimination, we begin to see more and more those things that I thought were okay or wholesome now are not wholesome. I can see they're not wholesome. And so I'll put those on the list of unwholesome items that I will start to see and then change. Mm-hmm. All right. So let's look at some of the thoughts that would be downright unwholesome. The one that I put at the top of the list because it's so common— a lot of people don't understand this because they think that, oh, I don't do that very much, when in fact we do it probably 100 times an hour. And that is take revenge. We have thoughts of revenge. We see something wrong, we don't like it, and we want to fix it. That guy hurt me, therefore I've got to go hurt him to get even. Yeah, so, or, uh, it can be done with a laptop or with a book or anything like that. But when we don't like something, then we want to fix it. In a way, that's taking revenge. For instance, if, uh, let us say that whoever it is that offended you, they don't want you to fix them. So if you come to try to fix them then they will see that they don't like you trying to fix them, and so they will go into revenge for you, and then you go back into revenge for them. And so you get into this pattern of revenge, saying that there's something wrong with him, or he offended me, or I don't like this, or whatever like that. And now we've got a job to do, the taking of the revenge, to make— to set things right, to get our justice. Mm-hmm. Okay, then in fact, uh, uh, that when a family has someone in their family who is murdered, everyone in that family wants big, big punishment for the killer. Yeah, right, they want big punishment. Okay, just caught, that's not enough. Then in fact, his whole lifetime in prison is not enough. We want to kill him. Because he killed my family member, right? Yeah, they're all to revenge. Uh, but very occasionally you'll find some family that will forgive the offender. It's okay that you killed my brother. I can handle that. I don't have to take revenge upon you. So anytime that we have thoughts of pain, thoughts of cruelty, thoughts of revenge, thoughts of taking something, doing something wrong, robbing someone, doing something to gain an advantage. All of those are unwholesome thoughts. So our wholesome thoughts— in the wholesome thoughts would be everything is okay, there's no problems. No worries, friend. Got this wired. Everything is all right. My bad, just, uh, okay. So having thoughts about this present moment rather than thoughts about the past— anytime that you're thinking about the past, more than likely you're thinking about something that's broken, it needs to be done. And now we're going to put all of those kinds of thoughts into the category of they're unwholesome, at least for the time of sitting. Let us say that we're talking about a meditation session or just sitting for a little while. That's the time to absolutely have wholesome thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker B:** That everything is okay. I could smell the air. I can smell and feel the moisture in the air, feel the wind and the touch. And so we come into the present moment, which means come into all of our senses. The mind door we've just talked about— what kind of thoughts are we having? But also the body, in the sense of what are the eyes doing? Are the eyes looking, or are the eyes just sort of not in gear? The motor is running, but you're not going anywhere with the eyes. You're not actually looking. So we can actually then put the eye door in service and look around and see what's around us. We can also begin to listen to what is sounds around, that in fact, if you are doing something, uh, whatever and all of a sudden you hear a really, really loud noise, like maybe a gun goes off or a tree falls or lightning and thunder, anything like that. When we hear a noise, we almost always come into the present moment. Yeah, because we listen to it. Okay, but if we do it instinctively, then we will have a reaction to it. We can call it a startle reaction. Mm-hmm. Right. But if we're listening already and then we hear the loud noise, then we're unlikely to be startled by it.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So in a way, what we're doing is, is that we're figuring out how to not get startled because we're already in the present moment. Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Thinking wholesome thoughts. And the wholesome thoughts that we're thinking have to do with what's happening right here in present moment.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So if there's already— what is the nose doing? What is the breathing like? What do I hear? What's going on inside the mouth? That's especially true when we're eating, is to pay attention to what's going on inside the mouth as we chew and roll the food around and things like this. So basically the process that we're talking about is coming into reality, which means coming into our present senses in this moment, remembering what we saw last week, but using the eyes to see right now. That's what the real practice is all about, and taking the effort to come into the present moment. And to see what's going on and then make some changes. One change that we could make is that normally when we're settled, we're not breathing very well, especially meditators will get drowsy when they're sitting a long time because they're not breathing well. So we have to make sure that we're breathing well. We call this, by the way, Anapanasati, mindfully breathing well. Mindfully we breathe in long, or we're paying attention to it is what I mean by mindfully, or Sati. So we're taking a deep long breath, and we can also talk to ourselves about that deep long breath. Wow, that's a really nice deep long breath. Wow, I really enjoy that. Wow, this breath is keeping me alive. Okay, so we begin then to have wholesome thoughts. That's the process that we're going through, and the more skills you gain, because the more often you practice, the more discrimination you'll have about, is this thought worth having or not? In fact, we could say it this way, that any thought that you could have, any thought possible you could have, most likely that thought could be improved.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** If you're thinking bad things about your dad, you can improve that to think happy thoughts about your dad. Mm-hmm. Okay. Now, there's one possibility I would say is that it's possible to wake up and recognize that the thoughts that you were having were absolutely wholesome. Mm-hmm. What happens? What do we do then? Hey, congratulations. That was a wholesome thought. Yeah. Okay. So we're looking at, in fact, the waking up, taking a look, making the effort that it takes to make a change. And then after we make that change over and over and over and over again, we begin to gain the confidence that we could do this. Mm-hmm. And that's where the fourth element comes in, that confidence that you're no longer a victim, as you were saying, about your— to the anxiety. Now you become the boss of that depression and anxiety. You're the man here. And how do you deal with anxiety? Well, let me ask you this question. How do you know that you have anxiety? You say you got it. How do you know you've got it?

**Speaker A:** Normally, if I'm lucky, I catch the thought, like worrying when I don't have to, when there's not a need to.

**Speaker B:** That's not anxiety yet.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but when it is anxiety, it's normally like the stomach starts to churn. I feel sick to my stomach, like I'm about to puke. My muscles are all tense. My heart's beating really quick. I'm like shaking.

**Speaker B:** And, um, okay, that's pretty heavy duty.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So one was before it happened, and then all of a sudden you're in heavy duty. But when you're sitting there, then in fact, and it starts to arise, it normally can be experienced in the chest, and you don't have to get the whole body tensed up with all of that adrenaline, that you can in fact begin to notice it. And when you begin to notice it, now the thing to do is, well, let's see if we can change it. Let's see if we can modify it. Let's see if we can change it with our breath. Can I make the anxiety bigger when I breathe in and then smaller when I breathe out? Can I actually just breathe out that anxiety, just breathing in and breathing out and kind of letting it go? Because Breathing is a purification process, taking in new oxygen and throwing out old carbon dioxide. So if we're doing it in a mediocre kind of way, then that means in a mediocre way we're taking oxygen and in a mediocre way we're throwing the poisons out. But if we really think about it and practice it with long, deep breathing, That means that we're taking a lot of good oxygen in, oxygenating the body, making it vibrantly alive, and then on the out-breath, we relax and throwing out all the old carbon dioxide and other amino acids that accumulate in the blood, and we breathe that stuff out. That in fact, if you have a good breathing system going, then you take a lot of pressure off the kidneys and the liver. That if we're ordinary breathing the way most ordinary people do, then that puts a whole lot of extra weight on the kidneys and the liver to do the cleaning process that should be done in the lungs.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so if somebody's got kidney troubles or liver problems like that, the best solution for them is to take a break, not work those organs so much by using the breathing instead. Okay, because whatever anxiety that you do have that you were talking about, that doesn't stay all the time. No, it has to go someplace. Where does it go? For most people, it goes into the kidneys and the liver for processing. Yeah, but what we're going to do is start breathing it out right away. Mm-hmm. See, if you can control that anxiety, because before you thought that it was controlling you, that you were a victim to your feelings. Now you can start to control those feelings through the breathing and through the thoughts. Oh, there's anxiety. I don't have to feel anxious. I can throw those kind of anxiety-producing thoughts out.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And come back to this present moment with some joy. Wow, I caught that anxiety. What a relief it is to know it's there before it gets big and takes over. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Because right now is good.

**Speaker B:** Pardon?

**Speaker A:** I was like, because, because right now is good. There's no need to be in the moment as long as there's nothing dangerous. It's fine.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and things right now are not dangerous. But if we get in the habit of thinking that we're being chased or that we've got work to do, or somebody's looking over our shoulder, if we have those kinds of thoughts, then we're going to have that anxiety produced. But if we have feeling there's nobody here monitoring me, and I've got plenty of time, there's nothing important, then I can just relax.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And in fact, there is nothing important much. Here's a way of looking at it. Suppose you were dead. Now, whatever it is that's important, is it still important to you after you're dead? No, not likely. So in fact, then the only really important thing is to stay alive, to be alive. Congratulations, you're still alive.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** All of the anxiety and all the depression and all the bad thoughts and all the bad deeds that you've ever done are of no consequence because you're still alive, you're still here. So you can kind of forget about the past because it's not really important. It's got no effect. What's affecting us with this present moment, and it's the thoughts that we're having now that cause the depression, and therefore the— or the anxiety, and therefore the depression. So if being alive is that important, then staying alive is all there is to do.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Now, one thing about it that most people don't like it when I hear that, when they hear me say this, but you're going to die. Yeah, absolutely. Without a doubt, no question about it. Medical science is nowhere near doing any magic. Yep, there's nobody being raised from the grave. People don't come out of the cross, off the cross, and walk around. There are no dead men walking. You're going to die, that's for sure. Guess what? It's even worse than that. You're going to die within 3 to 5 minutes from now if you don't take this next breath. In fact, the breath is what's going to keep you alive. And you can go without food for 30 days, you can go without sex for years, you could go out without sleep for 80 or 90 hours, but you can't go without air for 3 or 4 minutes. You've got to breathe. Yeah. If that's the case, then we can begin to understand in this context that breath itself is important, because without the breath you're going to die. And then whatever else you thought was important, is not important. Nope. So keeping your breath going— well, if it's that important, then why do we pay attention to it? We thought that Aunt Susie and the arguments that we were having with Aunt Susie were important, but it's not. Okay, so why should we be thinking about an old argument that we had with Aunt Susie when the important thing is to take a deep breath and enjoy the fact that you're still alive? Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, because when you hold your breath, it does cause anxiety. Like the— if you— like, I've held my breath under the pool and, and it does produce the same feeling of the tenseness, like panic.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but when you're well aired, when you're breathing well, then the anxiety is— well, even if you're having a few thoughts of anxiety, the anxiety is not going to stay in the blood because we're using the breathing to distribute and exhale all of those things, as well as paying attention to where the anxiety is. Now, most people will feel it either right there in the solar plexus, right here below the tit line, or right about the tit line. And other people will feel it as a sinking feeling in the stomach or an empty feeling. Sadness is often in the stomach, to where anxiety is generally a little higher up, which is where the blood is collected. There's a huge amount of blood with all of those organs around and the heart and the lungs and everything. There's a huge pool of blood in the center part of our body. And so when we start paying attention to that pool of blood area and start purifying it, you can recognize that you can take a lot of the pressure off. You can throw all of that amino acids and all of the anxiety-producing drugs like adrenaline and cortisol. Mm-hmm. Just throw that stuff out. Now, why do we have that? And why does the body go through those chemical reactions?

**Speaker A:** Because they were evolutionary beneficial at one point, right?

**Speaker B:** They were evolutionally beneficial at one point, that we needed to be on our toes because otherwise we're going to be eaten. Yeah, okay. And so, uh, that adrenaline gets us ready then for the danger. Okay. And so there's a sequence, and that is, is that, uh, freezing or stop breathing and just freeze is natural, especially when you see a gorilla or a rhino off at a distance. Or if you see a snake on the grass, you'll freeze, you'll stop. Yeah. But then the adrenaline kicks in, and now it has two things to do: either fight or flight. You're either going to run away or you're going to get into a fight or survival. Okay, now let's put it to the, uh, present moment situation. And there the guy is sitting behind his desk in the office. And he looks up and he sees the boss coming down the hall.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And he has that same reaction that we had 20, 120,000 years ago to the rhino, except that we're not about to fight the boss, nor are we about to get up and let him see us running away from him. I want to sit there, but we still have all of these bodily chemicals. Chemicals for that fight or flight. Yeah, it's sort of like, what are you going to do with all of this new energy that the body has produced getting ready for something really big? And there was never anything really big anyway, because all we do, all we did was saw the boss coming down the hall. Mm-hmm. Why did that fear turn into terror? Yeah, right. Well, we're supposed to be afraid of the bosses. Our whole society built on being afraid of the boss. You got to do what you're told to do whether you like it or not.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so that's part of the society imprinting, that it's not actually a rhino coming down the hall, it's just another boss, another person, and he's not going to harm you. Why do we feel like we're in great danger is because of those old bad habits that we have that are instinctual, but they've been programmed the wrong way. So we need to reprogram. And what is the program? There is no danger. The boss is my friend. I'm glad to see him walking down the hall. He's not dangerous. Okay, so these would be wholesome thoughts. Yeah, the unwholesome thoughts would be, oh no, he's coming. And the wholesome thought would be, oh, he's coming. Yeah, same words, but one's unwholesome and the other one is wholesome. One is productive to friendship and the other one is productive of competition. Thank you. And so we actually need to intentionally practice having the kind of thoughts that are wholesome, happy, nurturing. Nurturing thoughts. Well, I say the word nurturing because most of the time our thoughts are not nurturing at all. They're critical. Yeah, they're critical in the sense of comparison, judgment. This is good, this is bad, this is better, this is worse. Okay, and that whole mechanism of comparing things means that at least part of it is going to be unwholesome because you're comparing that to wholesome and it's not up to scratch.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And if it's not good enough, you're not happy or satisfied.

**Speaker B:** Right. OK. And so we need to change that critical mind of comparing things into nurturing mind where everything is already OK. So we practice then one of the wholesome ways of thinking is to nurture yourself. Everything is all right. Wow, I feel good right now. Wow, there's got nothing to do and no place to go. And wow, I'm just satisfied. Okay. These are all the kind of nurturing, wholesome thoughts that we have that are useful and are conducive to us feeling like we're the champion. So the kind of thoughts that we want to have would be, there is nothing dangerous here, I am safe, there is no boogeyman, there are no cops, there are no mommies, there are no bosses coming down the hall, and I can— there's no alligators on the floor. Yeah, there's nothing, no problem. And so we need to talk to ourselves about that to reassure ourselves, because if we don't, then those old habit patterns of things are dangerous will keep coming back. You see, things are really dangerous for a little child. Yeah, baby is dependent, and if it's not nurtured, it will die. But by the time we're 4 to 6 years old, especially by the age of 6, because that's when we're put into school Now we've got to perform. Now we're no longer the baby that's being nurtured and cared for and played with. Now we're taught we're mommy's little helper that have to go and do what we're told to do. Clean your room, close the door, do your homework, shut up, go away. Okay, and all of these rules keep coming in from all the adults around us, but we as little children don't have the discrimination, so we just take in everything, wholesome or not.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And later we tend to make rules out of all of that stuff, all of that imprinting and all that stuff that we picked up. We decide what's right, what's wrong, and then we set up a set of standards or rules. Now we have to follow our own rules. And most of the rules we set up, you can't do— they're more like goals than they are rules.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So we're constantly in a state of failure because we don't match up to our own rules, which are being critical. So we're critical of ourselves, we're judgmental to ourselves. We need to catch those kind of thoughts also, change them from critical thinking into nurturing Nurturing thinking. Oh, everything is all right. Oh, what a cute baby you are.

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker B:** Are you just so cute and cuddly? Let me give you a hug. You know, that's the kind of thoughts that we want to engender for ourselves so that we can come out of that anxiety that was produced by the critical thinking and become relaxed and free from anxiety because we feel nurtured and cared for. Feel like a winner, in fact.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so the kind of thoughts that we want to have is feeling safe, secure, comfortable, and then satisfied. You can't feel satisfied if you're not comfortable. Yet a lot of meditation teachers teach the students to sit for a long time and become uncomfortable. Yeah, I want you to be uncomfortable. I don't know why, but they want you to become uncomfortable. But you can't have a good session when you're uncomfortable. You have to be comfortable. Yeah, because if we're uncomfortable, we don't like it. We're dissatisfied. That's what we mean by uncomfortable. It's not satisfactory. Yeah, but if we have thoughts of safe, secure, and comfortable Then we can have thoughts of satisfaction, the thoughts of everything is okay, everything is fine. Let me take a look at the body. Yeah, it's still comfortable. No, wait a minute, that butt hurts again. And you readjust the furniture. Okay, that kind of thing. Sit up straight. Let's not have any tensions in our back or whatever. So we're actually going to look at the body, to scan the body, to find out where in the body there is discomfort, where in the body is there any tension. That if in fact the neck is tense, you can give the neck a massage a bit, you roll it around your head, get comfortable. Because if you can get yourself into the state of feeling safe, secure, and comfortable, then you can become satisfied, and that's an important point. Okay, that safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied is actually the definition of the Pali word Sukkha. And Sukkha is exactly opposite of the word Dukkha. Yeah, dissatisfied, right? Being uncomfortable, being afraid, being insecure. So insecure, uncomfortable, and dissatisfied is the state that most people are in most of the time, because they talk themselves into it since childhood. Yeah, we're going to intentionally spend the time with our right effort and our strong awakening and our investigation to have feelings and thoughts of comfort, security, safety, and satisfaction. Now, the Buddha talks about it like this, that those three elements— the waking up, taking a look and making a change, begin to run around each other, supporting each other, building up each other as a skill. So if you have a strong Sati and really wake up and really see what's going on, then making a change to it is easy. But if our Sati is weak and our investigation is weak, then it's going to take a lot of effort to make the change. Yeah, okay. So one of the examples that I use is, uh, an adult pushing a child in a swing. You know, a swing where they get on, sit down, the chains like that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, go back.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so the adult pushes the swing that's sitting at rest because of gravity where the child gets on the swing, but that first push is hard. Just like in our practice of Anapanasati, we can call it meditation. At the beginning, it takes a lot of effort to get started. But once the child is swinging, now the adult can stand back and only push when the swing is right in front of them. When the swing is here now, I can push a little bit and keep it going. If I stop pushing, then the swing will stop and I'll have to take a lot of work to push it, but if I can keep it going— so this is the way that we think about it. Yeah, it's going to take some effort to get the thing going, but once it gets going, it has some, uh, inner, uh, it's got, uh, momentum built up.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So the amount of effort is not quite so strong, but these three things run in circle around each other. So that our awakening and our investigation are getting stronger, doesn't take quite so much effort anymore. Yeah, once we get the swing moving, once we've got a flow going, now we can begin to say, yeah, I can do this, I can push that swing off and get it going, and I can keep pushing, I can keep going, and regain this confidence That confidence is in the Eightfold Noble Path, is called Samma Sanghappa. Samma Sanghappa, the fourth item on it is the right attitude. We all come to life born as a victim. We need the nourishment because otherwise we'll die. We can't take care of ourselves, we can't eat, we can't change our own diaper, we can't walk. Can't do anything. We're completely dependent or completely a victim. But as the child grows up, now that victimhood is really deeply imprinted because now he's being ordered around and he can't do what he wants to do. I have to stop playing with my toys and go do my homework. Oh, poor me.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so we keep that attitude of being a victim. And look at how many things we're victimized by. We're victimized by the governments. Whatever country you're in, you're a victim of that government. Yeah, religions— we're all victimized by religions. Christianity, the example is, is that you can't do it on your own, you need a Jesus. If you don't have a plastic Jesus on the dashboard of your truck, you're going to crash your car into a tree. Yeah, that's just how it is. That's what they teach, okay? You have to have Jesus. You have to take Jesus as your savior in order to be saved. You can't do it on your own.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Teach.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** So you're a victim of God. Mm-hmm. You're a victim of government.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Another one, a really new one now. This has not been, uh, the old ones have been there for quite a long time, but there's a new kid on the block. It's called big business. And yeah, victimized by big business. Oh, you have to buy my car in order to get that girl.

**Speaker A:** Yep, yep.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so that's the way that it works. We have to go buy those products in order to feel good. We can't just feel good on our own. What we see, we have to buy.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and those structures don't allow you to feel satisfied, so you keep coming back.

**Speaker B:** No, you— they want you to keep coming back because you continue. Even though if you bought it one time, if you buy one box of Kleenex and everybody only bought one box then Procter Gamble would go right out of business. No, they have to keep you buying Kleenex every day, every month. You have to keep buying Kleenex to keep them in business, which means now they teach you that you need the Kleenex. You can't wipe your nose on your sleeve. You've got to buy Kleenex to do it. Yeah, right. Okay. So there's another one, and that is that we are now also victimized by education. You don't get education, you're going to be dumb. Oh, you have to know that. Oh, you have to come to our school. Oh, we have to stay in school and pay us, or the government's going to pay us, until you get a piece of paper. But that piece of paper is not enough. You need another piece of paper. Yeah. And another piece of paper, right? You need to keep needing more paper because you're always a victim of that educational system that you're in. So these 4 things I call the GREB: government, religion, education, and business. We are all victimized by those things, and it's intentional. Propaganda and all of that stuff is to keep people dissatisfied. Yeah, people who are satisfied don't vote. Yeah, I vote. I don't care who wins. I mean, the Democrats or the Republicans are, you know, one's this and one's that. But look at the celebrations that are happening and the feelings of defeat. Everybody is feeling really good or bad. But even some of the Democrats are feeling bad and some of the Republicans are feeling good. But it's a mixed bag. Yeah, the Republicans can't get anybody to vote unless they're afraid. And so they have to demonize the Democrats to get people to vote. Yeah, to bring up territory. Oh, those are Black people. Those Black people are coming after your job. You have to hate them and vote against them. And the Democrats like Blacks. Okay, so here's that whole show that's going on, and we live in that pond. That society is— we live, and it is designed to keep you uncomfortable, afraid, and dissatisfied. That's the job of the culture, because if you're not dissatisfied, if you're completely satisfied, you're not going to produce much. You're just going to hang out and enjoy your life. Yeah, they want you to.

**Speaker A:** Work. I used to care a lot about politics. I'd read up on it, and then I'm like, well, I wake up tomorrow, I feel the same. Maybe I could feel better. That's not going to change who wins, who loses. How much social theory I read doesn't change nothing. I was like, in fact, it just—.

**Speaker B:** After the election, all of the people who were involved in politics, well, what do we do next? Now we got to go do this, that, and the other thing. Now that we've lost, we've got to go do this, or now that we've won, we got to go do this. And so in fact, the winning or the losing of the election doesn't change the feelings of fear and anxiety, depression, dissatisfaction. Discomfort. They stay the same. We have to actually practice rewiring our own mind, change some neurons in there. Yeah, start seeing when that anxiety comes up that, oh, I can deal with that. Yeah, take a deep breath. I don't need a Xanax. I could just sit here, just take a deep breath and open the lungs, open the chest, and let all of that energy that's built into the adrenaline kind of dissipate. Yeah, go back to a state of rest, back to a state of peace. This is the practice of Anapanasati, and we have to practice it over and over and over and over and over again. It's all about repetition. So you have your whole life as they say, is the story. You have spent your whole life repeating, repeating over and over and over again thoughts that made you feel bad. Yeah. Now it's time for you to repeat over and over and over again thoughts that make you feel.

**Speaker A:** Good. Positive, positive feedback loop.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, give yourself some positive feedback. Exactly. That we're going to actually create a positive feedback loop because we've been operating in a negative feedback loop because of all the negative thoughts that we've had, all the dangers, all the discomforts, all the lies we've been told. And so we spend our time thinking about all the stuff that we've been thinking about for years. So now we have to take the effort to change the way that we think. And also, we're actually not going to just change the thought themselves, but we're going to change the state of the mind. The state of the mind is in fact what we want to look at, and so we have to also not just look at the thoughts that we're having, but investigate, well, what state of mind am I in? Is the mind drowsy or is it sharp? Is it scattered or is it together and unified? Is it down or is it up? Is it gladdened or is it depressed? Okay, the state of mind. And what we're going to intentionally do is to gladden the mind or brighten the mind. But having wholesome thoughts, we could gladden and brighten the mind.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And it is pretty easy because my old habit was I would track my moods during the day and I'd see, oh, it's so low. And I'd be like, wow, it's so low. But never did it occur to me, oh, I could just try to make it better. And then boom, oh, I'm good for most of the time now, is the best thing.

**Speaker B:** Ever. So this is the way that we practice these four things. Wake up, strong waking up. Investigation, take a good close look. Number three, take the effort to make a change, to change what that thought is. And if that old thought comes back again, instead of, oh poor me, and becoming a victim by the second or the third— I mean, you can remove a thought and remove thought and remove a thought, and then it comes back again. And your ordinary uneducated beginner meditator will have, oh, poor me, oh, this is a monkey mind, oh, I can't control it. But they did for 5 or 6 or 7 times, they're able to control it. But the next time they let the old stuff come back. But you can catch that too. It's just, aha, I saw that. I saw me being a victim to my own mind.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's a fun game instead of a chore.

**Speaker B:** It is. You have been blessed with the most marvelous toy in existence, the human body with a human mind. Make it a toy to play with. It's a marvelous toy to play with. Yeah, but our society doesn't want you to play with it. They want you to— they want to put you to work. Yeah, that's for sure. They want you to produce, they want you to learn. The education wants you to learn, the business wants you to buy, the religion wants you to pay, and the government wants you to vote. Yep. And so they all are lying to you, giving you all kinds of propaganda to keep you dissatisfied, to keep them in business. And our job is to be happy. And if they go out of business, that's their business. Yeah, my.

**Speaker A:** Problem.

**Speaker B:** No, don't hate them. Yeah. So when we keep doing these things over and over again with right effort, over and over and over again, we begin to develop the attitude of I could do this. And eventually we get the attitude, hey, it doesn't matter how messed up my mind gets, it doesn't matter what the circumstances are, I can clean that out with a breath or two and come back to the reality of the moment and be here now and see the right things. Yeah, let me state that again. No matter how the mind is obstructed We can change it. That's an attitude. No matter how much it is, I can fix this. I could come out of it. Now, that statement, the Buddha says, is the first noble knowledge. The first noble knowledge is to come up to that level of sankhara of I can do this. This is, by the way, you've heard the lion's roar.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, I've heard you mention it.

**Speaker B:** That's what we're teaching you, is to become a lion. Yeah, roar, to be powerful. Yeah, okay, with that attitude of I can do this, I can make myself happy right now, I know I can do it, I've done it so many times before, I can do it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so the Buddha said that this is the number one first knowledge, the first noble knowledge that we get. This knowledge is noble, it is supramundane, which means above the world. World is trapping us on top of us. But this is super, super mundane. I can get out of it, and it's a factor of the path. This is part of the Eightfold Noble Path, is to have that confidence, this Samma Sanghappa. And then the last item they have, which is kind of an important one This knowledge is not held by ordinary people. Yeah, ordinary people have the attitude of being a victim. Mm-hmm. They spend their whole life being a victim. I mean, look how victimized Donald Trump is. You'd think in his status that he would be on top of his world, and he's not. He's a victim. He's complaining and blaming this, that, and the other thing solidly. So is Donald Trump. So is Putin. So Vladimir Zelensky. And all of these politicians are dissatisfied, feeling like a victim, and they got to fix things. Yeah. But here you are figuring out that you don't have to have that kind of position, that you can have the position of, hey, I know how to fix this problem by fixing the problem. Here's the problem is the ears is not out there in the politics. Yeah, no problem, no problem, no worries, no problems, mate. So you keep practicing this way to come up with that attitude, that attitude of a winner, the attitude of a lion, attitude of strength, the attitude I can handle this. Yeah, that's the same kapha. And if we have that, we add one new additional element to it. That is the element of wealth. I'm not talking about being rich with money or power. I'm talking about the wealth of joy. You've got so much joy that it just leaks out all over the place. You can't help but be joyful when you're around friends. Everybody who talks to me winds up having a moment or two of joy. Yeah, because it spills out. Okay, that's wealth.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so enough to share.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, then you can— but you know you do it, you got it, you've done over and over and over again, you've got the competence now. By the way, the word competence, the Pali word is shraddha or saddha. Okay. Which is translated often as faith. This has got nothing to do with faith. This has to do with evidence, solid, strong evidence.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and because I've practiced before, I know. So it's just to remember and keep remembering and keep replacing and get the feedback loop of good feelings going and going and going when I can and when I.

**Speaker B:** Remember. All right, well, I think that we've gotten somewhere today. Thank you. Keep practicing the way that you're practicing now and call me in a few days or a week, something like that, and we'll continue on with it.

**Speaker A:** Thank you, I appreciate your help.

**Speaker B:** All right, okay, well, go talk to Parker. He's a really good guy for you to become friends with.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and he's right there. So yeah, I'll send him an email. Well, I'll get in contact because he seems like a good dude.

**Speaker B:** All right. He would make an excellent friend for you.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Thank you, Dhammarato. I was just wondering, because I know you record the videos, then they get uploaded to YouTube. If this one could be uploaded like anonymous. As a— okay, if it— if you decide to or not. Um, yeah, but thank you. I appreciate your help.

**Speaker B:** And we have now, because of circumstances that we've kind of figured out, we put out one video every day. Yeah, but I talked to more than one person today. Okay, not all the videos get loaded. All right. A worse thing is, is that they're really backed up about a month in advance.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay, thank you so much.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we can list this one as anonymous, no problem. We don't have to use your name. Your name— nobody looks at the names anyway.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I know. Yeah, I guess some— a little Dukkha, I guess.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I know. And that's a good way to look at it. As I talk to students, in fact, that's part of the reason why we should have the videos on YouTube. Is that gives people a chance to say, oh yeah, I don't mind at all, or you're going to put my video on YouTube.

**Speaker A:** You know what, keep the name then. I'll let it go. Let it go. I don't have to worry. I don't have to worry.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Okay, so one last point. I'd like to introduce you to my friend Robert. He's been sitting right here.

**Speaker A:** Hi, how are.

**Speaker B:** You? Yeah, he's leaving today to go over to Deepapawan to do a retreat starting today. Wonderful. So anyway, we'll see you later.

**Speaker A:** Okay, see you.

**Speaker B:** Have a good evening.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye. Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) with a student (Speaker A), focuses on the practical application of the Eightfold Noble Path to overcome anxiety and depression and cultivate genuine happiness. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: Taking Charge of Your Mind**
The central message is that we are not victims of our thoughts and emotions. Through deliberate practice, we can rewire our mental habits from ones of dissatisfaction (Dukkha) to ones of well-being (Sukkha).

### **Key Teachings & Practices:**

1.  **Powerful Mindfulness (Sati):** The first crucial skill is not just weakly "checking in" to the present, but **fully waking up** with gusto and appreciation—like being happy to be alive after a long sleep. Examples (like responding to a parent or driving) illustrate the difference between being absent-minded and fully present.

2.  **The Threefold Core Practice:** The heart of the method involves continuously cycling through three factors of the path:
    *   **Strong Awakening:** Vigorously coming into the present moment.
    *   **Investigation:** Using all six senses to take inventory. Check your breath, body sensations (comfort/discomfort), and thoughts.
    *   **Right Effort:** Actively making a change from the unwholesome to the wholesome.

3.  **Wholesome vs. Unwholesome Thoughts:** Happiness depends on learning to discriminate and choose our thoughts.
    *   **Unwholesome:** Thoughts of revenge, criticism, fear, comparison, and dwelling on the past/future. These create anxiety (energy arousal) and depression (shutting down that energy).
    *   **Wholesome/Nurturing:** Thoughts of safety, comfort, satisfaction, and "everything is okay right now." The goal is to create a positive feedback loop of good feelings.

4.  **Anxiety & Depression as Habits:** They are two sides of the same coin—anxiety is fear-based arousal, and depression is the attempt to shut it down. The cure is not a pill, but the threefold practice: wake up, see the unwholesome thought pattern, and change it.

5.  **The Primacy of Breath (Ānāpānasati):** Breath is life's most immediate need. Conscious, long, deep breathing serves two vital functions:
    *   **Purification:** Oxygenates the body and expels stress chemicals (adrenaline, cortisol), taking pressure off organs like the liver and kidneys.
    *   **A Tool for Mastery:** You can use the breath to directly manipulate anxiety, making it smaller on the out-breath, proving you are the "boss" of your state.

6.  **Cultivating the Attitude of a Winner (Sammā Saṅkappa):** Through repeated practice, you build **confidence/competence** (saddhā)—the evidence-based knowledge that "I can fix my mind." This is the "lion's roar," an attitude that breaks victimhood. It is the first "noble knowledge."

7.  **The Goal: Sukkha:** The ultimate aim is to cultivate a state of **Sukkha**—feeling safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. This is the direct opposite of **Dukkha** (insecurity, discomfort, dissatisfaction).

8.  **Societal Conditioning (G.R.E.B.):** A major obstacle is our conditioning by societal systems designed to keep us in a state of Dukkha so we keep consuming:
    *   **G**overnment
    *   **R**eligion
    *   **E**ducation
    *   **B**usiness
    The practice is about freeing yourself from this ingrained dissatisfaction.

### **Practical Advice Given:**
*   Treat your mind and body as a "marvelous toy" to play with, not a chore.
*   Constantly scan the body for tension or discomfort and adjust for comfort—you cannot be satisfied if you're physically uncomfortable.
*   Replace critical self-talk with nurturing self-talk (e.g., "Oh, everything is all right").
*   Remember that in the present moment, if there is no immediate physical danger, you are fundamentally safe and can choose to relax.
*   The most important thing is to be alive and appreciate it. Everything else is secondary.

### **Conclusion:**
The talk is a pragmatic guide to self-liberation. By tirelessly applying the simple formula of **waking up, investigating, and making a wholesome change**, you build the skill and confidence to master your inner state. This transforms you from a victim of external forces and internal habits into a self-reliant source of joy and contentment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate the principles of mindfulness, the Eightfold Noble Path, and the nature of anxiety and depression. Here is a breakdown:

### **Metaphors and Analogies**

1.  **The Pencil Sharpener:** Used to illustrate the difference between a weak and a strong "coming into the present moment" (Sati). The weak version is an absent-minded "It's over there." The strong, truly mindful version is to stand up, walk over, and say, "Hand me the pencil and I'll sharpen it for you."

2.  **The Student Coding:** A story about a student so absorbed in writing code on his laptop that he fails to notice his father entering the room to say goodnight. This illustrates being lost in a "thought world" instead of being awake to the reality and relationships of the present moment.

3.  **Driving on Automatic Pilot vs. Racing:** A metaphor for attentiveness.
    *   **Ordinary Driving:** After learning, we drive on "automatic pilot," not fully paying attention.
    *   **Race Car Driver:** The speaker tells a story/joke about wealthy people hiring retired race car drivers as chauffeurs because their survival depended on hyper-vigilant attention. This represents the level of focused presence one should cultivate.

4.  **Martial Arts:** Used as an example of a skill that forces presence. "If you're thinking about Aunt Susie while you're in a match, you're going to get your face busted." This shows the necessity of being in the present moment for effective action and safety.

5.  **Musical Taste (Jazz vs. Classical):** An analogy for developing the skill of discriminating between wholesome and unwholesome thoughts. Liking one genre over another comes from paying attention and knowing what to listen for, just as recognizing wholesome thoughts is a developed skill.

6.  **Pushing a Child on a Swing:** A central metaphor for the effort required in meditation (Anapanasati).
    *   **Initial Push:** Starting the practice requires significant effort, like getting a stationary swing moving.
    *   **Maintaining Momentum:** Once the swing (your practice) is in motion, less effort is needed to keep it going—just a small, well-timed push (consistent, gentle effort) is sufficient. This illustrates how the factors of the path support each other.

7.  **Breathing as a Purification System:** A physiological metaphor.
    *   **Shallow Breathing:** Puts extra "cleaning" pressure on the kidneys and liver.
    *   **Deep, Mindful Breathing:** Takes in good oxygen (vibrant aliveness) and actively expels carbon dioxide and "anxiety-producing" chemicals like adrenaline and cortisol. It's portrayed as actively "breathing out" anxiety and purifying the blood.

8.  **The Boss as a Rhino:** A story to explain misplaced anxiety. Seeing your boss walk down the hall triggers the same ancient fight-or-flight chemicals (adrenaline) as seeing a dangerous rhino, but there's no actual threat. This illustrates how societal conditioning and instinctual habits create unnecessary anxiety that needs "reprogramming" with wholesome thoughts.

9.  **The Human Body/Mind as a Toy:** A reframing metaphor. Instead of seeing the mind as a burden or a "monkey mind," the speaker suggests: "You have been blessed with the most marvelous toy in existence, the human body with a human mind. Make it a toy to play with."

10. **The Lion's Roar:** A metaphor for the confident attitude (Samma Sankappa) that results from practice. It represents the "first noble knowledge"—the powerful, unwavering confidence that "I can do this; I can change my mindstate no matter what."

### **Conceptual Frameworks (Extended Metaphors)**

1.  **Weak Sati vs. Strong Sati:** The entire talk builds on this foundational metaphor, contrasting a drowsy, automatic, and partial awareness with a vigorous, intentional, and full presence—"waking up after a very long sleep and you're very happy to be alive."

2.  **Thoughts as Alive/Dead:** Thinking about the stressful past or future is "kind of a death." Waking up fully into the present is "like becoming alive."

3.  **Anxiety & Depression as a Machine:** Depression is described as the mind's attempt to "turn this machine off because it's running too fast," framing them as two aspects of the same overactive fear mechanism.

4.  **The GREB (Government, Religion, Education, Business):** This acronym is a conceptual story framework. The speaker portrays these four societal institutions as systems designed to keep people in a state of victimhood, dissatisfaction, and fear so that they continue to consume, vote, pay, and produce. The practice of mindfulness is framed as liberation from this "pond" of cultural conditioning.

5.  **The Pool of Blood:** A visceral metaphor for the central torso area (solar plexus, chest) where anxiety is often felt. The speaker describes it as a "huge pool of blood" that can be "purified" through mindful breathing, releasing the accumulated stress chemicals.

In summary, the speaker uses relatable, everyday stories (pencil sharpener, dad saying goodnight, boss in the hall) and vivid analogies (swing, race car driver, rhino) to make abstract Buddhist concepts like *Sati*, *Sankappa*, and *Dukkha/Sukkha* tangible and practical. The overarching narrative is one of moving from being a **victim** of one's thoughts and society to becoming a **confident, playful, and joyful master** of one's own mind.
