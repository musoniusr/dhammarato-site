### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Way.

**Speaker B:** Like, I'm not like, oh, I'm a hardcore, you know, secular or what have you. But yeah, I would say, yeah, it.

**Speaker A:** You know, it is difficult to be really into the supramundane Dharma and the practice based off like direct insight into the liberation of suffering here and now, and then go somewhere like, you're like, oh, Buddha's like this, this stuff works. And then you go somewhere and then you see it's pretty much just like the Buddhist form of the same Christian church you came from. They're worshiping people, they're doing, it's very ritualistic. They're like, they're kind of just like worshiping the Buddha as if it's like some kind of god, just the same way as if like there'll be a statue of the Buddha, just the same way as if there's a crucifix of Jesus, and you know, you'll bow and like pray to it. And I'm like, whoa, this is just the— this is just the Buddhist form of Christianity. It's like nothing new. Uh, but, but then there's like, you know, this— you'll still find like within that like authentic spiritual practice and stuff. Like, that's just like the outer packaging. But yeah, it's hard to relate to some of it. That's why I tend to be more secular, you know, I don't really do the worshipping deities that I can't see and stuff like that. You know, I mean, especially Mahayana, it's even worse, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there can be a lot of that, but definitely, yeah, like with the rules and stuff, that can kind of, you know, come in and maybe obscure things a little bit. Yeah, for sure. I was going to say though, Scott, I don't see you. I think your webcam is off.

**Speaker A:** Is it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah. There we go.

**Speaker A:** You can see it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I can see you now. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, perfect. All right, well, hello everybody. Welcome to the weekly UK Sangha call. I've kind of been on a hiatus, but I'm going to try to start coming and starting these up every Wednesday and with some material prepared, maybe some suttas to read or maybe not. Depending on what the audience is. But we have me and DJ here, longtime friends. And we picked out some, some short suttas here, like a couple of them to just kind of shotgun and then see what comes up from that. How's that sound, DJ?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, sounds great.

**Speaker A:** All right, all right. So the first one I'm going to read is from the Samyutta Nikaya 47.5, A Heap of the Wholesome. Okay, so this is the Samyutta Nikaya. It's not the Majjhima Nikaya, which is a different body of work. Okay, here we go. At Sāvatthī, there the Blessed One said this: Bhikkhus, if one were to say of anything A heap of the unwholesome. It is about the five hindrances that one could rightly say this, for this is a complete heap of the unwholesome, that is the five hindrances. What five? The hindrances of sensual desire, the hindrance of ill will, The hindrance of sloth and torpor. The hindrance of restlessness and remorse. The hindrance of doubt. All right, so this is just good stuff, man. These are 5 primordial hindrances that every single incarnated— I shouldn't say incarnated, this is Buddhism— every single living being born as a human deals with. So, and it's saying, oh yeah, this is the root problem. This is the problem for everyone. But if we look at— so if we look at Western medicine's point of view, like They'll say, oh, this hindrance is a mental illness, right? You're mentally ill when you're experiencing literally one of the root problems laid out by the Buddha thousands of years ago for everybody. I mean, you know, obviously there's gradients to this type of stuff. How intense is the hindrance, right? A little bit of restlessness, versus a lot, and then you say, oh, you have a lot of restlessness, you have anxiety disorder or something. No, actually, you're just dealing with one of the five hindrances, right, that literally every living being deals with unless they have entered into first Jhana or beyond, you know. So Yeah, stop thinking of yourself as mentally ill. Start thinking of things as how the Buddha categorized it. And then this will lead to much more effective and clear-sightedness on how to actually deal with these obstructions and how to actually transcend them ultimately.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's clear, right? And it's simple and it's precise and it's manageable when we recognize that it's about dealing with the hindrances that have arisen, you know, now. So yeah, sorry if you— Yeah, no.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, no, I really appreciate you jumping in whenever you want to. The— Yeah, and there's only one of these five too. If you ever like look, take an honest like self-reflection play-by-play, why do I feel terrible right now? Why do I feel like shit? It's either one of these 5 reasons. It's never not either some desire, sensual desire. And people, and these are umbrella terms. So sensual desire covers a lot of different types of desires. A lot of different types of wanting something that you don't have. You know, it doesn't have to— like, if you think sensual desire, you might think, oh, like, maybe you are only thinking about like a sexual desire or something like that. No, it's any desire that has to do with sight, touch, taste, feel.

**Speaker B:** I.

**Speaker A:** Said touch and feel, but those are the same things. Sight, hearing, taste, feeling, and even thinking, cognizing. Right? So desiring something that you're thinking about, desiring something that you see, desiring something that you want to touch, or are touching, desiring something you want to taste, you know, food. All of this, all of the five senses.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. And it's what I find very beneficial about the sutta is that it points to, okay, what is wholesome, what is unwholesome. Like, yes, we do the investigation, but it's very clear here when the Buddha is talking about the five hindrances, right? This is unwholesome because when we have sensual desire, we feel a sense of lack. We don't feel whole. We don't feel complete right now. So when we spot that and we were like, oh, okay, cool, we can drop it. We can come back to feeling whole, complete, without lack. Okay. Right. But any of these hindrances make things feel un-okay. Right. So.

**Speaker A:** Right. And it's usually a mixed bag of the hindrances. So usually along with the central desire will come some restlessness and so on. Yeah. So it's usually it's not like, oh, I only have this one hindrance now. It's usually like a It's a party of the hindrances.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, all part of the same, like Dukkha pie. Yeah, they come together.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. The next one. Yeah, the next one, ill will. So for example, I'm not getting that, that woman that I want, or I'm not getting that thing that I want. So now I hate the reason, I hate the person that's stopping me, or I hate the thing that's preventing me from getting that thing. So that would be ill will. You know, yeah, a lot of the, I mean, almost all, if not a lot of the ill will is connected to sensual desire. Right? Why would you be angry? Because you didn't get what you want. And you'll find the culprit, or that's the reason I didn't get what I want. Right? So if you don't, if you don't really desire anything like How would you hate somebody when you already are satisfied, right? When you already have what you want, when you don't need anything else? There's nobody, there's no villain or enemy in your story that's making you the victim to direct some kind of ill will at. Yeah, and the ill will can be anything from as small as annoyance to full-blown hatred, right? And, and yeah, so like, you can literally hate a group of people because you read something in the news, right? And just take, like, to have some self-reflection. That those things that you read in the news, first of all, the news may not even be an accurate depiction of what's actually happening, may not, maybe only a piece of the puzzle. But all that stuff is not, it's not here in the reality of your experience. So you're actually just dreaming yourself up into a state of hate, into a state of hatred and ill will. So you're sitting there in your room suffering because your mind is going into places, unskillful directions, that is actually creating internal suffering. No matter how good you think it feels to be angry and to hate, to be righteously indicative, you look at your bodily sensations and you develop mindfulness, you'll see, oh, actually there's a lot, there's some, there's a lot of tension in my chest, and I'm, I don't know, I'm all, I'm all tensed up, and I'm actually in a state of ouch, this hurts, right? So realizing the pain, the pain and the Dukkha of, of these hindrances is is pretty important. It's pretty important in order to actually want to get rid of them, right? A lot of people don't even want to get rid of them. That's the first step, is like realizing, realizing the problem and then wanting to get out of the problem, right? If you don't, if you don't even think it's a problem, then you're just going to keep being stuck in it. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yes, so there can be kind of a half-heartedness sometimes to it, which can kind of go into a bit of like the sloth and torpor with that kind of half-heartedness, as well as even the doubt. You know, we doubt the teachings, and then we also doubt our ability to, you know, engage with those teachings to make that change, right? They all work together.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and so this is why the Buddhist teaching is so important. Because, again, like you said, with the sloth and torpor, a lot of other teachings will be like, oh, well, this is just what's coming up. Just accept it. This is a good thing. Like, you know, don't do anything about it. Just let it be the way that it is. And I mean, that can be a skillful equanimity. But it can also be a rationalization to not actually take the right effort to get the mind out of this unskillful directions, to actually go in a direction that is conducive to authentic joy and happiness. And delight that will lead to your unbinding ultimately and freedom from these hellish states, hellish states of mind. Yeah, so the good news is, everybody, there is a way out. You're not doomed to the cycles that you're stuck in. There is a practice that is leading to the way out of these things. And no, you don't just have to sit there and suffer and churn through your karma until hopefully the magical Shakti pot will come down and save you from it. No, the good news is you can right now do it for yourself and pull yourself out of this heap of garbage and into a better place of mind. And we all have access to do that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So sloth and torpor, you know, feeling dull, feeling sedated, feeling like, I don't want to get out of bed, or like, I don't want to do that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm too tired to, you know, change from the unwholesome to the wholesome. So I'm just gonna like you know, be, I guess, you know, yeah, just not changing it, not making that like right amount of effort, right? I'm too— I can't make the right amount of effort. I'm too tired. I'm too exhausted, right? Yeah, seeing that and waking up to it. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Or it's like you're scrolling your phone and you feel like, I just can't do anything else. And like, I'm stuck in this. These are all illusions. So like, your body is actually full of all kinds of stores of energy that it may seem like you're really tired and dull. But there is a way to get that kind of innate energy within the body to start releasing out and energize yourself into a state of brightness and clarity. You know, if somebody came and.

**Speaker B:** You.

**Speaker A:** Heard a huge knock on your door and your door was slammed down and there's a SWAT team coming in, chances are you're not going to be feeling very dull, like, right? You'd be like, what is going on? You know, so that's just one example of, uh, you're not stuck in any of these types of ways that you're currently feeling. Like, you know, there's ways to change it. Um, there's ways to like kind of like hack, uh, how your body and your mind is feeling.

**Speaker B:** Um, yeah, yeah, sometimes it's as simple as just changing the breathing.

**Speaker A:** Changing the breathing, that's a big one. Yeah, so things are wandering off into ill will, wandering off in desire. Well, in that moment, you could just breathe, you know, even just count your breaths, like, okay, I'm breathing. One breath, two breaths, three breaths. Okay, this is much more enjoyable than what my mind was doing before. Let me just breathe. So it doesn't have to get to the point where it's so bad that you're like, damn, I need to get out of this. Right? You can catch it before it gets to that point where you're like, oh, shit, I got to do something about this suffering. I'm in a, I'm in a very bad state of mind. Now I got to do something. Right? Sometimes it takes that to start doing something about it. But we can catch, oh, there's a little bit of restlessness, there's a little bit of, oh, something's not quite right here. Before I go and try to fill the void with all kinds of vices that would just make it worse and worse, I can be like, oh, I see that little bit of restlessness, that little bit of Dukkha. Let me just take some breaths, realize Everything's fine. You know, I'm here. I'm alive. Safe. So why do I feel afraid then? What is there to be afraid of? Yeah, it's an irrational fear. Okay, I feel good enough again. Let me go back to my same like shitty tendency. Yeah, you know, so like we'll go through these cycles, right? So, but the trick is, the trick is wake, uh, the just developing the habit of waking up out of it, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you know, like developing the skills to like wake up and, you know, break that cycle, make that change.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, sorry.

**Speaker A:** No, no, go ahead, please.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I was just gonna say, did you get through the first paragraph there of the sutta, or— I'm not even.

**Speaker A:** Through the first paragraph.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we just got to the hindrances and then we're starting.

**Speaker A:** No, I do. That's why I love these suttas, because it's like it really spurs on useful things to talk about, you know. I mean, I could just robotically read the whole thing, but I think this is— yeah, I think this is better.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no, I was just thinking about like the later part of it, you know, because we were covering a lot of the wholesome and coming back to the breath and the body and all that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So let's keep going. Yeah, so sloth and torpor, restlessness and remorse, and then doubt. All right, so doubt is a big one. So a lot of times I think you'll be practicing the breath or something. Am I even doing this right? And what is this really going to help me? Like, am I really meditating? You'll go in this like mental circles of like Okay, am I practicing Dharma? Like, is this right? I don't feel better right now. What's going on? Like, I'm all doubtful and confused. So that's another hindrance that you need to like, nope, forget all that. Just breathe and relax. Right? Without doubt. No.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I find— yeah. Oh, sorry.

**Speaker A:** Doubt is the very reason why it's not working.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I find it helpful with doubt is to be like, yeah, if you can see the doubt, like if the practice, you know, part of it is spotting those hindrances and gladdening the mind, right? If I'm like, oh, I see your doubt, you know, that overcomes it a lot, right? Because it's not like I can doubt that I'm doubting. Right? So that's sort of the thing is it's like that sort of catch thing of like really brightening up. Oh, I see a doubt. And then it overcomes it, right? Because we recognize we aren't doubt. Right?

**Speaker A:** You know, there is a triumphant, there's that triumphant hit of joy where it's like, ha, there's that doubt again. I caught this. There's the snake in the grass. Let me grab that fucking snake by the, by the head and be like, here's the doubt. And here's what's trying to sabotage my practice. You know, so there is that like hit of joy that you get from spotting these hindrances.

**Speaker B:** Aha, I see you, Mara.

**Speaker A:** I see you, Mara. There's that hindrance. Got that one. So you start to develop confidence in the Dhamma because you realize, well, this is the exact one of the hindrances that he was talking about. You know, instead of it all just being confusing and you don't, you feel bad, but you don't know why. No, you feel bad because it's one of these 5 things. Which one is it? Categorize it. You know, congratulate yourself for spotting it. And then you can return to the true practice that actually works. You don't believe it works? Well, you're not doing it. You're not trying it hard. You're not actually doing it. You know, you're doubting. You're, oh, does this actually work? You're like pussyfooting around it instead of doing it. You know, I can tell you, I mean, here, like, here's the living proof. DJ right here. Here's me. I could tell you for a fact it works. You know, I'm sick of, like, I got sick of the whole being a victim, all life sucks. Let's find a way to get out of this shit. And okay, there's this guy named the Buddha that has a whole mythology and a whole broken down science how to get out. Let me practice this like as if I'm going to the gym and practicing getting bigger and stronger. All right, so I go to the gym once. Lift some weights. Oh, I'm not, I'm not ripped like the next day. Oh, it doesn't work, right? No, you go keep going, you know, keep practicing. It does work.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And it's like directly verifiable. Like you're like, okay, yeah, I know this does work, you know, right? And, and developing, yeah, that confidence of just doing it over and over again, rinse and when the hindrances arise, that we see them, and then we triumphantly go, Aha, you know, I see you. And yeah, it works in that wholesome feedback loop. You know, whereas before, you know, we get into the hindrances and just follow that, right, and continue with it. Now we know how to break the cycle. Now we know how to get out of it, and we just keep practicing it. And returning back home and enjoying that feeling of being whole and complete.

**Speaker A:** It's beautiful, man. And a lot of the things that it says in the suttas, like, magnificent, Master Gautama, magnificent. The Dharma has been made so clear in many ways, as if he was turning upright what has been overthrown. Revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who is lost, holding up a lamp in the darkness for those with eyesight to see forms. Right? These kinds of things start to hit you when you realize how actually it works. Wow, there is a way out of my misery. You know, it's It's all of the confusion. It's turning upright what has been overthrown. It makes sense. It's not, oh, believe in Daddy God and worship Jesus, and maybe he'll save you and have mercy on you if you're pitiful enough and you put yourself low enough. No, this is the way, and it's for you to see for yourself. You know, save yourself, become your own hero, triumph through the darkness. You know, that's what matters in this life. It doesn't matter how much money, power, esteem you have. It matters what's inside. Have you found it? If you're happy, you're the richest man in the world.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's just it. Like, when I think about it, I'm like, you know, I could have all the money and all the fortune and all the wealth and all the fame. And I would not trade that. I would not trade that for the.

**Speaker A:** Dharma in a second.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, for the Dharma, for the non-dualization of this. No, no, not for a day.

**Speaker A:** That's the illusion of the world. That's the illusion of the— they say, oh, all these things, oh, these shiny objects, these are where the happiness is. But it's never in the objects. It's in the very essence the suchness that all of the objects arise within, right? So this is the illusion that we're all waking up out of, that we're put into here in the Samsara. And I wanted to share a little Nisargadatta— he was like, I don't know, he was like a quasi-Advaita guy— but a thing that Katal shared on Instagram, because This is kind of relevant to what we're talking about, or what I just said. So Nisargadatta Maharaj says, your outer life is unimportant. You can be a night watchman and live happily. It is what you are inwardly that matters. Your inner peace and joy you have to earn. It is much more difficult than earning money. No university can teach you to be yourself. The way to learn is by practice. Right away, begin to be yourself. Discard all that you are not. Go even deeper. Okay, so like, forget about go even deeper, because that's a— we don't want to say that here in the Dhammarato Sangha. Saying go deeper is a taboo, it's a no-no word.

**Speaker B:** But.

**Speaker A:** Discard all that you are not. So seeing no self— oh, I'm not this, I'm not my thought. The self cannot be found in the thought, in a feeling, in a bodily sensation, and so on. Just as a man digging a well discards what is not water until he reaches the water-bearing strata, you must discard what is not your own till nothing is left which you can disown. You will find that what is left is nothing which the mind can hook onto. So nothing that you can cling to, nothing that you can grasp to. That's what's left when you realize everything that you're not. You're not even a human being. You just are a point of awareness coextensive with time and space. And beyond both. The ultimate cause itself uncaused. If you ask me, who are you? My answer would be nothing in particular, yet here I am.

**Speaker B:** Nothing in particular.

**Speaker A:** Nothing in particular, yet there is something. Something is being experienced. There is suchness. There is a That-ness, there is a Dhammakaya, there is the Dhamma. You know, there's no 'me' to be found in any one of the pieces, but there is the Dharma which is unfolding perfectly and according to according to natural order, natural unfoldment. Isn't that nice? Not take it personally, not worry about it, you know. Be not afraid. There's nothing to fear.

**Speaker B:** What I find so helpful time and time again too, in terms of coming back to the teachings of the Buddha, right, is in a way it's not even so much, you know, about gaining something in a way, but it's more the absence, right? So it's like the absence of Dukkha. Right? That is where true satisfaction is. Right? So it's not in any of the particulars. Right? But it is with, you know, the absence of that craving or wanting things to be different. Right? And recognizing that and letting go of it. You know, that's where the true, you know, reliable, you know, you can call it satisfaction, but whatever it is, just okayness. You know, there's a relief to that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's like satisfaction is just the natural way that things are. And Dukkha arises as a byproduct of mental constructions that are actively being created by one who does not realize that these constructions are the source of their own Dukkha. And so because of these Dukkha that have been created by destructions, they will always be seeking an end to that Dukkha by creating more constructions rather than just stopping the constructions that created the Dukkha to begin with. Right. And I hope that makes sense to people who maybe if they're not familiar with Buddhism, hear that. Yeah, so it, you know, I could say that to you, DJ, and it makes perfect sense. But I think a good practice to have— Dhammarato likes to do this a lot— try to say the thing, the Dhamma, the superman name Dhamma, in a way that like any Joe Schmo who hasn't been introduced to these types of things can hear it. But us nerds who like really like the technical Pali terms, we can all sit here and have a laugh about and, and, and reap the joy that comes from knowing the technical precision of the Buddha, because it's a lot, it's a lot more, it's a lot more well-balanced and fully encompassing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And it's funny though, because it really is like pointing to something that's quite simple in terms of the Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, or dissatisfaction and the end of dissatisfaction. Right. It's like, why are we dissatisfied? It's because we want something that we don't have. Right. Because of course, when you want something you don't have, you're dissatisfied. That's like the definition of being dissatisfied. Right.

**Speaker A:** Right. So yeah, so just to riff off that, so if you're in a Buddhist circle and you've been practicing for a long time and you want to have a Jhana or you want to have a Nibbana and you don't have it, well, you're dissatisfied.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Stop wanting that.

**Speaker B:** No, that's it. Yeah. And so like kind of going back to talking about the hindrances for a second, right? And when it's talking about like the heap of the unwholesome, right, is the five hindrances like that is what is getting in the way of satisfaction in a way is those five hindrances. So with the absence of the five hindrances, with the, you know, being able to overcome them, being able to see them and recognize them, right, and then being able to drop them, then Piti and Sukkha will arise, right?

**Speaker A:** Because there's a wellspring of Piti and Sukkha just waiting to burst out as soon as those hindrances subside, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** As soon as the mind is not occupied with any of one of those hindrances, every breath feels good just to be alive. The simple joy of just being here and breathing. Wow, you know, I'm alive. I'm still alive. I made it this far and I'm not dead yet. After all the snowboard jumps that I went off of and all the probably stupid things I've done in the past, all the reckless driving, here I am, I'm still alive. Wow. Or even if you're not as reckless as me, you know, you could have been hit by a car anytime you went to work. But we're still here. What a way, what a celebration to have. I can breathe. I can feel, I can see. Look at this marvelous experience that's just appearing. You know, you don't have to take acid to realize this. I mean, you might, but you can get into this sort of state of magnificence and Aww, you know, if you can spot the obstacles that the Buddha laid out here. Yeah, I really like taking our time with these suttas because it's so rich. The wisdom is so, so rich. And you can read it like a formula and you can just be like, okay, 500 says blah, blah, blah. Yeah, you get right up. But no, what is the hindrance? Like, what does that mean in my experience?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, exactly. And I mean, that's the way too. It can be good to, you know, a wholesome thing to go over, right? Like the five hindrances and be like, oh wow. Like sometimes I'll enjoy playing with that, which is just the appreciation of the absence of the hindrances, you know. Oh wow, it's nice to, you know, not have any sensual desire, not want anything right now, right? Right. But then, so this is where I find it fun, because then, like, if any of the other hindrances come along, like, you know, like doubt, like, oh, well, you can't say you're free from, you know, whatever. Aha, I caught you doubt. That's that one arises. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Oh, I'm no, I'm no, I'm no Arahant. I couldn't possibly be liberated, or I'm no, I'm no advanced practitioner. There must be some sort of hindrance around here. Let me find one, right? That isn't there, right? So yeah, doubt in yourself, doubt that you can be liberated, self-rightly liberated here and now. Doubt is like, oh no, maybe, maybe if I keep practicing another 10 years, maybe I'll get into it. No, the Dhamma is immediately effective to be investigated, to be seen here and now. Yeah, it's immediately fruitful. There is no if, ands, or buts about it. You know, oh, but I'm not that good of a practitioner. Maybe if I keep studying about it, maybe if I keep— I need a teacher. No, anyone watching this video, if you never had a teacher in life, if you do, if you recognize the wisdom in this, you can apply for yourself. You could even read it in a book and fully comprehend it right there. Okay. There is no teacher of the Dhamma. There's just the Dhamma. The Dhamma is inherent to the way reality is. The teacher is— life is the teacher.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And it may happen because of causes and conditions, you end up in a person who is, quote unquote, teaching. But that's just life. The circumstances of life have synchronized for that encounter to happen. And the teaching and the wisdom arises in that moment. But the teaching is never in the person who's even talking it. It's not in the body-mind. There is no perfect gurus. Oh, this is the perfect guy. Dhammarato is just a normal guy. I've met him in person. He has weird flaws and he gets— you might get pissy about something. He's like anyone else. But the interactions that I had with him because of the cause and conditions have perfectly synchronized for wisdom to arise from that moment because the Dhamma is is all, is ever present. The Dhamma is always there, you know. It's all available.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, when you remember and you wake up, there it is.

**Speaker A:** There's Dhamma in the Dukkha. There's Dhamma in the liberation of Dukkha. There's Dhamma in— it's all a beautiful story that's unfolding, like, you know, all of the, all of the bad stuff is part of the perfection of the dharmakaya. It's part of nothing, nothing can escape the causes and conditions by which the universe unfolds. You know, that's what, that's why the Buddha is called the Blessed One. But really, it just means the lucky guy. So The Buddha was in the right place in the right time. And he was lucky and fortunate enough to discover the Dhamma. You know, the Buddha was not an individual chooser, individual entity who, who chose and had choices. And no, all of that just spontaneously arisen as the Buddha. You know, and it's all still spontaneously arising for everyone. There is not a single separate entity. There's not a single separate person apart from the Dharmakaya. There's not a single separate self in the entire cosmos. There's not a single separate person. There's only the beliefs that are arising within each localized point of consciousness that I am a separate person. And the belief is arising and passing away because of causes and conditions, and that Dukkha is arising and passing away because of causes and conditions. And if you have encountered the Dhamma in this lifetime, somehow you stumbled in here, consider yourself a lucky guy. Because that's the conditions for the path out of it. All right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that's it.

**Speaker A:** But one way or another, it's all leading to it, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. When we kind of recognize, you know, how fortunate we are to have, you know, stumbled upon the Dhamma, to be able to practice it, to be able to, you know, wake up and lay down the burden, if you will, you know, that just fills the mind with an immense amount of gratitude, with an immense amount of appreciation when we truly recognize this, you know.

**Speaker A:** And gratitude and appreciation, and it can even come with an immense amount of power and confidence. Yeah, to that, whoo, you know, the confidence in the Dharma.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we can do this.

**Speaker A:** The realization that this is the Truth with a capital T. This is the way. So the mind develops confidence, okay? Doubt is annihilated. Okay, so I'm going to continue with the sutta. I really love these sidetracks though. Yeah, me and you sit with even one noble friend and so much good can come of it. The— what is that quote that I think was it Alex posted in chat? The antidote that is the same for all five hindrances, our five enemies, is to have noble friends and noble conversation. Truer words have never been spoken. I could have been in a hindrance 5 minutes before this call, but here I am having a noble conversation with my noble friend, and goddamn, I feel good right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right. No, it's wonderful. Yeah. And yeah, it's like you were saying before, it's like necessary, that power of Sangha, right?

**Speaker A:** You need all 3. So you need the Sangha, you need the Dhamma, and you need the Buddha. That's why it's said we take refuge in the Dhamma, we take refuge in the Sangha and the Buddha. And you got to catch them all. Okay? You can't just have the— there is no Buddha. So they're interdependent, they're codependent arising, you know, to use that word, to bring it back to Piti, Samuppada. The Buddha does not exist without the Sangha. Sangha does not exist without the Buddha, and the Dharma does not exist without the other two either. You know, they're actually one and the same thing. So you can't pull one out of it, right? The Sangha of noble friends comes along with the awakened mind. So the way that I'll I'll talk about the way that I'll talk about Buddha is like, yeah, okay, the historical Buddha, right? Gautama. But the Buddha, you know, awake, the awakened mind, right? The eye of wisdom that awakens, you know, when this stuff is comprehended, there is an inner awakening, the eye of wisdom that sees dependent origination that sees perception and feeling. And I'm not talking about just understanding, okay, we have perceptions, we have feelings, but no, sees the very moment that a mental impression arises of a perception and the moment it passes, the moment a feeling arises. So the very deconstructing of our experience, which leads to the real thing, Nibbana. So Dhammarato will be like, oh, Nibbana, just cooling off. Yeah, yeah, that's true. But Nibbana, the cessation of craving, the cessation of all formations, and then the realization of unsurpassed emptiness to be experienced by the wise. Practice the Dharma. Right? Not just the monks, okay? Anybody, anybody who listens, anybody with little dust in their eyes, you can do it too. Okay? It's not It's available to everybody. The Dhamma is everywhere and within everything. All right. Right. So sloth and torpor, restlessness, reward, doubt. I think we covered all those pretty well. If one were to say anything, a heap of the unwholesome, It is about these five hindrances that one could rightly say this. For this is a complete heap of the unwholesome, that is the five hindrances. If Bhikkhus, one were to say anything a heap of the unwholesome, it is about the four establishments of mindfulness that one could rightly say this. For this is a complete heap of the wholesome, that is, the four establishments of mindfulness. What for? Here, Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body, in the body, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world. All right, this stuff gives me goosebumps, but I'm going to translate that into normal person speak. I really like that. Is this the Bhikkhu Bodhi translation? Oh yeah. I really love Bhikkhuni, man. The way he writes this stuff. Gets— it lights a fire under me. But let me translate that. Okay, go ahead. Wait, what were you going to say?

**Speaker B:** That's very wordy, but I do like it. It points pretty clearly, man.

**Speaker A:** I love this stuff so much. This— these sutras really— this is why I'm going to start doing the Wednesday calls again, man. This stuff is so good. Such so good for me and my practice. Having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world. Okay, so what does that mean? And in simple terms, that means you're not thinking about your boss. You're not thinking about anyone here who's not in the room. You're not thinking about your ex-girlfriend. You're not thinking about, oh shit, like what? Like that conversation I had earlier. Did I say the right thing? What do they actually think of me though? Like, what did they mean by that? They said that, but I kind of felt a weird connotation from it. What did that person think? So all these mental circles will go into it is thinking about the world or like covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world. So thinking about, oh, how can I position myself in the hierarchy? What could I have said better in that position? Oh, now I finally knew what I should have said in that argument. Finally, I got that right answer. You know, like Dhammarato says, the whole Aunt Susie thing, right? So that's what this is talking about, covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world. Stop thinking you're alone now. You're alone, you're here. It's quiet, it's still. Stop thinking about your boss. Stop thinking about your work life. Stop thinking about your wife. Stop thinking about the girl you're talking about. Stop thinking about, oh, what could I have done better? What did I do wrong? Or reminiscing on a past thing of, oh, like, I made those people laugh. Let me keep returning to that memory over and over until I suck all the joy out of it. It's like covetousness and displeasure with regard to the world. So the world is all of our interpersonal interactions that have happened in the past or could happen in the future. You know, that's what the world means to people. The world is other people. Other people is the source of our mental Dukkha, constant thinking, what do they think about, right? It's always other people in our minds that we're thinking about. Not other people that we're talking to face to face. That's its own beast. That's Dharma. That's reality. How do I skillfully talk to this person here and now? That's practicing Dhamma. I'm all alone now. I'm thinking about those people. And I'm getting all worried, all feeling really bad about myself, creating all kinds of false, false boogeymans in my own mind. No, that's all delusion. You know, that's all delusion. And so that's what that means. Having put away— let me bring the tab back up. I lost it. I have so many tabs open right now. Okay, that's what it means. The covetousness for the world and whatnot. Okay, let's see. If Bhikkhu is one were to say anything of the heap of wholesome, it is about the four— okay, the mindfulness. For this is a complete heap of the wholesome, that is the four establishments of mindfulness. This is the same sutta, right? The Heap of the Unwholesome.

**Speaker B:** The Heap of the Wholesome. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Oh, okay. It is about the four establishments of mindfulness that one could rightly say this, for this is the complete heap of the wholesome. All right. So the four establishments of mindfulness. What for? Here Bhikkhu's Arahant, the Bhikkhuni dwells contemplating the body in the body. All right, so I'd like to hear your translation of that. I mean, it's pretty straightforward, but what is dwelling contemplating the body in the body, my noble friend DJ?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so there's a couple ways of seeing it. I mean, one, there's the non-self part of it, which is just seeing the body as the body, right? The body is non-self. So there's that aspect, right? And I would say too, it's also, you know, in terms of directing the mind, right? It's waking up to what's happening in the body now as well, right? So this is why, like, it's kind of like where to direct the mind towards the wholesome. Well, it's with the body. So that's with the breath, right? So coming back to the breath, coming back to the sensations of the body, right? Being aware today, it's such a wonderful anchor to bring us back to what is happening here now. And in a way too, When talking about the four foundations of mindfulness, you know, sometimes people be talking about here and now and all that stuff, and it can be kind of vague. If we point directly to these four foundations of mindfulness, or the four establishments, whatever, the Satipatthana, that's what's happening, you know, now, right? These are all things that are going on now that we can look and investigate. And part of that, though, is seeing the body is just the body. The body is not I. Yeah, and.

**Speaker A:** Exactly true. And also to bring it into a more technical practice instruction, literally feeling the sensations of the body. So when's the last time you felt this? Since you like directed mindfulness to the sensations of your diaphragm, you know, You're always experiencing your diaphragm, but like, like you kind of deconstruct the experience of the body. There's the experience of your diaphragm, there's the experience of your gut, there's the experience of all these internal organs, more or less, you know, obviously you can't— there's no nerve receptors on most of your internal organs, but you are feeling sort of sensations in the belly. You're feeling sensations in the diaphragm, you're feeling sensations in all parts of your body that normally you don't even pay one second of mindfulness to. So you just— it sneaks in as me. Right? So if we're directing our clear mindfulness, ardent mindfulness, sensations of the diaphragm, sensations of the chest, sensations of the face, sensations of the hands, sensations of the legs, sensation of the body. This is seeing the body as a body, right? So it's kind of like, you can kind of sharpen the awareness to realize that this whole thing is actually a transparent set of sensations that is appearing within. It's one subset of sensations that's appearing within a larger subset of sensations, right? So that the sensations of the room and the sensations of the body is all on equal footing. You know, if we're like fully aware of as it happens, you know, like the body is like a bag of beans, as they say, you know, it's just like this thing and the body is inanimate. There's no awareness hiding in the body. There's no awareness behind the eyes. This is all just sensory phenomena that's arising. And then also, I like the thing that Daniel Inger and Frank talks about, is there's actually a speed to this thing. So you can develop how fast, how many sensations can you catch, you know. The speed is actually, is actually part of the practice, you know, skill development. How fast can you catch all of the rapidly changing sensations? Right? And that's just one thing. That's the body. So there's so many toys to play with here, guys. If your practice has become dull, then you're not realizing all of the practice that is available, you know. Okay, so contemplating the body as body, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard for the world. Yeah, so you can't be like lamenting about somebody who's wronged you in the past if you're actually paying attention to the reality of the sensations here and now of your body. And a lot of times the body is a little bit too difficult to do. It's too advanced. So for most people, it should just be the breath. You know, start with the breath, the sensations that you're always breathing, and it's always obvious that you're breathing. And it's always obvious that— so you could just be experiencing the sensations in the breath. If the body is too— that may be too advanced. Literally just breathe. Okay, I'm breathing. One breath. Two breaths. I know that I'm breathing. Well, breathing is actually not so bad. Breathing actually feels good. Feels a lot better than all the bitching and moaning I was doing in my mind. Right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly. Breathing is wholesome, you know, and with that too, coming back to, you know, the body is wholesome. But yeah, the breath is one of.

**Speaker A:** The— okay, yeah, this is a really condensed sutta. So if we were to get into the Anapanasati sutta, it would start with it. So yeah, the body is the next step. If your mind is not, you know, kind of collected, ardent, fully aware enough, The body is kind of a, it's too big of a thing to like, yeah, really the breath.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because yeah, if we were going to the Anapanasati Sutta, right? And sometimes, yeah, we don't necessarily have to take the steps in sequential order. But we start out with like, you know, breathing in long, I know I'm breathing in long, breathing out long, I know I'm breathing out long, and then the short breath. And then it moves on to like, that's the first two steps. The third step is becoming aware of the whole body. And then the fourth step is relaxing it, right? So it's actually also, yeah, when working with the body, that's also it too, is relaxing, right? So all of that's wholesome is working with that. And that's sort of a good direction. But oh yeah, we might want to move on to the second Foundation of Mindfulness there though.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes. Okay. Oh, hold on. I need to adjust something real quick. Yeah, you can, if you want to continue reading it, I'll be right back.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, no, I don't actually have it up with me here.

**Speaker A:** Oh, okay.

**Speaker B:** But I know that it's going to go in the order of feeling because that's the second foundation of mindfulness there, right? So that is like, on one hand, it is like the, you know, liking, disliking, not knowing, right? So actually, if we're kind of continuing with the Anapanasati, you know, sutta, is that is really when we're working in, when we dropped away, you know, the hindrances and what have you. And we're, we're talking about that here. If we come back to the breath, well, there's really, if we're aware of that, No, there's the absence of the hindrances, right? If we're present with that. And as we relax the body or what have you, Piti and Sukkha do arise. So it's becoming aware of that feeling of— so, you know, putting it in non-Pali terms, right? We have that feeling of joyful success come up and we have a feeling of satisfaction of everything being okay. So there's that element of that too. To, right? But the main thing is, is that, you know, sometimes we look at these and it's like, okay, there's one part and then it's the second, but they're all interlinked as well in terms of like the four foundations of mindfulness. So it will cover, you know, feelings. And then also we're going to get into mind as well. So that's another foundation of mindfulness. So one of that is being aware of the state of the mind. So like gladdening the mind and what we were talking about before with like, you know, when we spot the hindrance and we like are like, okay, glad to see you, or, you know, aha, I see you, Mara, and we're working with that, right? That works to help gladden the mind, though I will say when it comes to that brightening, that gladdening of the mind, it does go a bit beyond just using language and words and like wholesome thoughts in there. There's sort of a substrate with that, but that does help. Right? It does help to work with that.

**Speaker A:** So, couldn't have said it better myself, buddy. Sorry, I have a really small bladder, as you know, so I have to go pee a lot. Always. Yeah, so you can go to the restroom and mindfully pee. Yeah, you know, you can always practice the Dhamma.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And, and yes, guys who— anyone's reading this recording, join these calls because, wow, is this a hit of Sati. Okay, I'm not a guru, I'm not an enlightened being, but talking about this stuff, reading these suttas, implementing it, I experienced the immediate fruit that is available for the Dharma. Okay, and I haven't been here for a while, and it definitely things have gotten a little bit more unwholesome, but I can bring it back to the wholesome by coming back to this stuff because this is the way, man. Like none of that other— so it's like, okay, this is the thing about Dhamma practice is we'll go through phases of wow, we found this stuff and then we'll go through phases of like disillusionment, disenchantment. It's like, ah, Fuck that shit. I'm not interested anymore. But then so then we'll go down back into the path of dukkha. And then until— so we look, oh, shiny object. Oh, women. Oh, money. Okay, actually, I want that stuff more. So we'll go back until the dukkha gets bad enough. And then we're like, oh, damn, the dukkha has gotten so bad. I should start practicing again. Right? So it's kind of normal to go through these cycles of being interested in practice and then having a lot of enthusiasm and falling out, you know, and coming back to it. And until I guess when you become an old dog, you realize that nothing else is really worth being interested about but the Dharma. And then maybe that's time, maybe like, okay, it's time to be a monk. Or maybe you're just a layperson, that's fine too. But like, always, it's always the Dhamma at the heart of your interest, you know, you have a girlfriend. Okay, let me put the Dhamma on the side, like this person's more interesting to me. No, still, it's still the Dhamma, even within the midst of that relationship.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I can relate to what you said, though, in terms of that, like falling off for a bit, then you get back in, you know, and you kind of become more aware of the knuckles as time goes on. Yeah, right. Yeah, I want to say too though, yes, how you're talking, it's like how fast-acting it is though, like the Dhamma. And when you get back into it, you're like, wow, you know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you're like, wow. Yeah, so, so, so, so, so, um, don't think— never expect yourself to be perfect or, um, things to be perfect. And don't, don't expect someone who's teaching you Dharma to be perfect either. Because none of it is perfect. Okay. It's, it's, there's this, there's a sort of beauty in imperfection. I was listening to a different talk unrelated to Buddhism. But yeah, like, if you look at like a handcrafted piece of furniture, for example, that handcrafted piece of furniture isn't going to be as technically perfect as one built by a machine, right? But there's something more beautiful about it. There's something more beautiful about that little imperfections and flaws, right? So like, there's a beauty in the imperfection of life and the fuck-ups and in the falling in and out of practice. It's a beautiful story. And it's beautiful to go through these kinds of cycles, to these losing your way and then rediscovering it and whatnot. And it's all based off causes and conditions. Maybe because of the causes and conditions of your birth, maybe you become enlightened as a 12-year-old, and because you realize death fully in that moment, so you lie down and accept death fully, and then you go off and you go to a temple and sit there residing in just like constant bliss for the rest of your life because you realize that nothing else is worth clinging to and nothing in the world is interesting. So like, that could happen too.

**Speaker B:** I wonder who you were talking about with that.

**Speaker A:** I mean, you probably know who is it.

**Speaker B:** What, Ramana Maharshi?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, I'm talking about Ramana Maharshi. Yeah. So it's like, yeah. And then also, here, at least, at least I'm not, I don't know about other people. I'm not a Dhamma fundamentalist either. So I'm not like, my school, there's no enlightenment, there's no Dharma to be found in other ways. I just think that anyone who becomes awakened through other means or other circumstances have realized the Dhamma. It's just that their tradition has different packaging, different methods, different explanations. But the teachings of the Buddha is it's more well elaborated, and it's more precise, and it's more effective. And maybe it takes some other traditions to kind of get you ready for that tradition. And then maybe in those traditions, you're actually, even though the pointer might be different, what you're actually doing is coming out of the hindrances and doing right effort and so on. It's just that the way that they tell you to do it is different. And then maybe within the Dharma practice, you're trying to practice the Dharma, but you're not doing it at all, you know. So it's not as black and white as people make it to be. Yeah, we are not Dhamma fundamentalists. We're not going to proselytize, go to war, argue with other sects, you know. Um, let's see, where did we leave off? The heap of the unwholesome.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** What, so, so, so, so, so did we stop at the body? Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so we were moving on to feelings.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Yeah, mindful, removing, removed covetous displeasure for the world. Okay, he dwells And do you have like somewhere to be after this? Because I'm really enjoying this. I'd like to keep going.

**Speaker B:** Well, yeah, I probably do want to wrap it up. I'm going to be having dinner fairly soon.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** So yeah, probably like 10 minutes or something. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So let's just finish at this, at the end of this sutta then. We didn't even get to the other ones. That's okay. Okay, he dwells contemplating. Yeah, and thanks for starting this up, DJ. Really enjoyed this.

**Speaker B:** We had no— and thank you for joining. Yeah, pleasure. Yeah. And I had a feeling, I had a feeling we might be able to go on one sutta for like over an hour.

**Speaker A:** So that tends to happen, doesn't it? Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Even one that's like 2 paragraphs like this, but there's so much in there.

**Speaker A:** There's so much in there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so he dwells contemplating feelings and feelings, mind and mind, phenomena and phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world. If one were to say anything, A heap of the wholesome. It is about these four establishments of mindfulness that one could rightly say this, for this is a complete heap of the wholesome. That is the four establishments of mindfulness. Okay, feelings as feelings, feelings and feelings, mind and mind, phenomena and phenomena. Feelings, you know, what are they? They're obvious. A lot of time they're ambiguous, you know, ethereal, not fully recognized. But a feeling is kind of like a texture, a quality of experience, a general ambience, a general It's sort of like a nebulous cloud that's appearing in our experience somewhere, right? Often connected to a bodily sensation.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. That's the interesting thing too, when working about with the Four Foundations of Mindfulness is how they all kind of come together. And I know when talking about practicing, you know, Anapanasati, or just in general, you know, the mind and the body— and Dhammarato has brought this up— can have a pincer effect on the feelings, right? So when we, you know, direct the mind towards the wholesome and the body, then the feelings will come up. You know, in terms of that Piti and Sukkha, which are going to be, you know, still pleasant feelings, right? So that would be more in the line of the pleasant feelings if we're looking at it in terms of feelings as like, you know, pleasant, unpleasant. And I don't know if it's pleasant or unpleasant, right? So the three different feeling tones. But yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** A way I don't know if this is— I'm not a lineage Thai forest monk, but the way that I think about it is the mindfulness, like the acute awareness of the feeling may be unpleasant, but the mindfulness of it is pleasant. So does that make sense? Yeah, I know what I'm— obviously, you know what I'm talking about. Of course you do. It's like there's the feeling, but it's like the clearness of seeing it, like that in and of itself is like a quality of consciousness, a quality of mind that sort of like, if you identify with the feeling, if you are the feeling, then you feel like shit. But if you are the seeing of the feeling, then it's like, that feeling is just an appearance. It's just a cloud. It's a nebulous cloud that may even be evaporated by the sheer power of that awareness. So it's like, the awareness is the sun shining on the cloud until the cloud dissipates. And the cloud, the cloud, the cloud, the cloud can no longer withstand the heat, the clarity of the mindfulness that you have developed of deconstructing these feelings, of really looking at them.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah, I see what you're talking about. In terms of like, you know, when the Sati, you know, when we wake up to it and we see, oh yeah, this sensation or this feeling is not, you know, self. And we see how it morphs and it changes and it can be like this beautiful dance, you know, even between like, you know, tension and release, if you will, right? This kind of coming and going and it's this beautiful thing. And when we're non-attached to it, we can just enjoy the show. You know, enjoying the show.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, precisely.

**Speaker B:** And that's very much— yeah, the seeing the feelings in the feelings, right? Like not going in and being like, oh, this is my feeling and I have it and I need to hold on to it. No, it's so wonderful. It's just like, no, we can see it, we can enjoy the show.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the seeing is much faster. It's happening. So like the seeing of things is instantaneous The thought or the feeling comes like a mind moment after. Yeah, it's like you're seeing the thought and the feeling, but the thought and the feeling.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there's like almost like an oscillation, right? Like it's going back and forth, right, between like thought, feeling.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, um, and it's so rapid. That's why this is fun.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, exactly. It's fun, you know. Yeah, it's a fun, you know, can be a fun, playful, you know, investigation. And that's like the beauty of like looking into these, you know, four foundations of mindfulness. This is why it's like wholesome. It's available.

**Speaker A:** The heap of the wholesome. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And then too, yeah, with like the mind, right? And investigating you know, the mind states looking into that, you know, part of that is changing from, you know, the unwholesome to the wholesome. So part of that can be like, okay, we're changing the actual content. If we're still working with verbal thought, right? Like, oh, okay, everything's all right right now or whatever, right? Oh, it's so nice to be taking this, you know, breath right now, you know, things like that, you know. But then it's also changing that. And this works very close to the feeling, I find. But that underlying sort of tone, you know, and the mind comes more into harmony, into unification. So also, you know, working with the mind, we come into more of a unified mind state, whole mind state, harmony, unified.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And then the more unified the mind state becomes, the more harmony starts to appear in the thoughts and the feelings. So the thoughts and feelings begin to flow with a sense of harmony and order and collectedness. Like, you know, thoughts and feelings aren't bad things. Like, a lot of times when we're having a more unified, more stable, like, arousal of feelings connected with good thoughts, you could be thinking like one wholesome thought after another. And then, oh, isn't that nice? And isn't that nice? And like, and there's nothing to get out of it. Like, be like, you already get, you already arrive just by being aware of it. Like, just by like, that's the, that's the practice. Like, that's the destination is the clear comprehension. Like, there's nothing beyond, there's no goal to achieve beyond waking up and seeing it clearly. Like, it's not like you're going to level up and level up. Like, you've already arrived just by the fact that you're looking. That is already the enlightenment. Just by looking, you're enlightened. That's waking up. That's the awakening of the eye of the Dhamma, or the awakening of the eye of the wisdom. The very fact that you're here trying to do something about suffering, or like waking up to the problem of suffering, waking up to the path to the end of suffering. There's no other path. No, going over there and getting getting that snack, or looking in the fridge, even though you've looked in the fridge 1,000 times, and you already know what's in there, walking back to the fridge and looking at it again is not going to solve your suffering. Or playing a video game that you're kind of sick of, but maybe if you just keep playing it, maybe you'll get some suffering. Some happiness out of it, or scrolling Instagram Reels and you're not enjoying it, you know, it's unfunny reel after unfunny reel, but you keep digging, maybe you'll find a funny meme. That's Dukkha, you know, seeing, oh, what am I doing here? I'm craving something. I'm craving something that will be gratifying to look at. That will be gratifying to listen to. That's suffering. So once you see that craving, you see, oh, that's not going to lead to happiness. But simply looking at it and understanding it clearly is, wow, okay, congratulations, this feels good. Like, let's celebrate, you know, maybe I'll play a song. And enjoy, really enjoy that song because I'm happy, you know. So you get— it's not saying like, don't— you don't have to renounce the world, you don't have to become an ascetic, but the, the, the direction of the seeking of happiness changes, uh, it flips. So you're start— you're starting from happiness, and everything you do, everything, every person you interact with is just a celebration of that happiness. Wow, music sounds so much sweeter. Wow, even interacting with the cashier, or random people you meet. Oh, how's your day going, man? Like, pretty good. Like, it's like everything is just the birds chirping outside. They're just singing the song. It's like it all kind of synchronized together to like sort of like the triumph of awakening manifests in Samsara rather than the defeatism of ignorance manifesting in Samsara as unpleasantness, problems, Dukkha. Yeah, so this is like kind of a law of attraction type of thing, but like, yeah, you start from what is the foundation of my happiness, what is the foundation of life, what is the true meaning of life, what is the true way to life. And everything else is just a byproduct emerging from that. It flips your life inside out entirely. And all the shit that you think is important really isn't that important anymore.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And, and, and you are the wealthiest man in the world. Like, you, at that moment, you're happy, you're satisfied, you are the emperor of the universe. I mean, I heard Papaji say this, so I don't want people to think like I have some kind of like grandiose like delusion complex. Papaji said like, yeah, when you are happy, you are the emperor of the universe. Like there's, yeah, like you are, you are unsurpassed. The happiness, it's all, it's all the, the activities of the world are not, you're not invested in the game. You're not even playing the game. You've already won it. It's beautiful. No matter what your circumstances is, You're a cashier, you're a night watchman, you own a cigarette shop, you referee water polo. That's what I do. I'm not rich.

**Speaker B:** But.

**Speaker A:** Life is so— life is good, man. It's beautiful. You know?

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah, it's like the beauty of this is it's like cutting directly, you know, to the source. It's cutting out that like middle, you know, man, you could say of like, oh, I've got to get whatever thing.

**Speaker A:** I got to get this and then I'll be happy. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** No, it's funny. Yeah. Yeah. It's cutting out the ignorant thirsting, you know, letting go of that. Letting go of that ignorant want is what's going to quench it. And it's much more reliable to quench it than, oh, I get that thing and then I'm satisfied for 5 seconds and then it's on to the next thing, you know. And this is how people will live their entire lives. But when we recognize this, we're like, wow, you know. And so that's the beauty of it. It's not like we have to be like, you know, an ascetic all the time or what have you. We can go out into the world and we can like things. I really like that story, you know, about, you know, the two monks there, and they were talking, and I think it was one of the, you know, big days, and all the women were dressed up and what have you. And the one monk says to the other, like, what do you think about this? And he's like, oh, I like, you know, it, but I don't want it in terms of that. So the point is, is if you're following that and you're like, oh my gosh, I need to like lust after all this or what have you, that's a problem. But if you can just sit back and be like, okay, I like this, I like this conversation that I'm having, you know, with this cashier, but I don't want it. I don't need to have that. I don't need to keep pining for it. When I come back and sit down into seclusion, I can feel that same amount of joy. I can feel that same amount of satisfaction, right? I can— one of the phrases I come back to fairly repeatedly is just, I can be happy without it. Whatever I think it is, I can be happy without that. You know, be happy with just this, just this breath, just being aware of this breath.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And actually having it is the obstacle to your happiness.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Because you think you have it and it, even, even when you're happy in it, when you have it, like you have it right in your possession, there is the— you're afraid to lose it.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Yeah, that's true.

**Speaker A:** So there's still Dukkha even when you do have it. Having things is what causes us mental agitation and Dukkha. Even while you have the 10 out of 10 girlfriend, oh, what is she doing right now? Is she talking to other guys or is she going to leave me? Or Like, even when you have it, you're suffering because you have it. It's better just to have nothing. I mean, spiritually have nothing. Now, I'm not saying sell your car or whatever, but to spiritually have nothing. It's— you don't have any sort of bondage that's causing you worry, like, oh, I need to worry about this. That's why the monks really don't have any possessions too. Like, it's like the outward, like full-on, uh, to the extreme that. But no, to spiritually have nothing. Yeah, like even, even if you have a wife and kids and, and, and, uh, you can be such a good part of the community and make people's lives so much better being a layperson. But, but, but that, but that happy that happy father does not have anything.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** The only thing he has is God, you know, which is nothing. So the realization that you don't need anything to be happy. In fact, needing things is the only reason why you would be unhappy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no. And what's funny too is this is making me think about the guru thing. Who, because if you're like, oh, I'm a guru, I'm this super, you know, enlightened being and all that stuff, and you're holding on to that as self, as I, that's not reliable. You've got to defend it. Now I've got to defend this.

**Speaker A:** You gotta defend it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I can lose this, you know, and all that stuff. If we're grasping on to that, that's why it's like, okay, letting go.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you don't have to have enlightenment. It's like, that's why a lot of these, uh, these gurus or Rinpoche, they end up doing some kind of weird perverse behavior because it's like there's like a split personality. There's like the, oh, I'm this enlightened person that I present myself to other people, but that's not really what's going on inside of me. You know, it's better to realize, you know, I'm kind of a degenerate. I have weird, weird fetishes and desires. It's better to be honest with that and just realize, okay, these weird desires, I don't need to have those. You know, these are just things that— intentions, mental impressions that are arising. Why are they arising? Because I'm a little bit restless and I'm desiring some sensual pleasure that I don't have right now. And but that sensual pleasure is illusory, false. It's Dukkha. Even the sense pleasure, even the thing that feels really good to the body, it can deceive us into thinking, oh, this is happiness. But even that is Dukkha. You know, the happiness is super mundane. It cannot be found in something.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it goes beyond the particulars.

**Speaker A:** It goes beyond. It's like even when you're experiencing first Jhana or happiness, there may be— that's why it says it's accompanied by Piti and Sukkha. So the Piti and the Sukkha may be felt somewhere in the body, right? But the supermundane level of happiness cannot be found in anything in particular. Like it cannot be found somewhere. And then that's why the the delight of that, not finding happiness in anything, not even the Piti or Sukkha. That's why ultimately the quote says it leads to Nibbana. So the path leading to Nibbana, that is where the mind delights. So the mind delights in it, in this path. All right, well, I think that's a good note to end it on. I don't want to hold you any longer.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no, that's a good place to end it. And I really enjoyed this chat, Scott. It's been really good.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, man, it's really good to see you, friend. Yeah, and I'm really happy to have this wonderful, wholesome friendship that we've developed over the years. It's really good. So yeah, I mean, I hope if you can make it next week, that would be cool. But if not, I'll see you another time.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah. I probably should be able to, but yeah.

**Speaker A:** Anyway.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** Take care, friend.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by **Speaker A (Scott)** with participation from **Speaker B (DJ)**, is a conversation within a small online Sangha. The discussion centers on a sutta from the Samyutta Nikaya (SN 47.5, "A Heap of the Wholesome") and expands into practical, accessible Buddhist practice.

Here is a summary of the key themes and progression of the talk:

### **Core Themes & Summary**

1.  **Critique of Ritualistic Religion:** The talk begins with a personal reflection on the difficulty of relating to traditional, ritualistic forms of Buddhism (and religion in general) that can resemble "the Buddhist form of Christianity," focusing on worship and ceremony rather than direct insight and liberation.

2.  **The Central Problem: The Five Hindrances:** The heart of the discussion is an in-depth exploration of the **Five Hindrances** (*nīvaraṇā*), which the sutta calls "a complete heap of the unwholesome":
    *   **Sensual Desire:** Any craving related to the senses (sight, sound, taste, etc.) or thoughts.
    *   **Ill Will:** Anger, hatred, or annoyance, often stemming from frustrated desire.
    *   **Sloth & Torpor:** Dullness, lethargy, and mental heaviness.
    *   **Restlessness & Remorse:** Anxiety, worry, and guilt.
    *   **Doubt:** Skepticism about the teachings or one's own ability to practice.
    *   The speakers emphasize that these are universal human experiences, not personal failures or modern "mental illnesses." Recognizing them clearly is the first step to freedom.

3.  **The Solution: The Four Foundations of Mindfulness:** The sutta presents the **Four Foundations of Mindfulness** (*satipaṭṭhāna*) as the "complete heap of the wholesome." The practice involves:
    *   Contemplating the **body** in the body (e.g., through breath awareness).
    *   Contemplating **feelings** in feelings (pleasant, unpleasant, neutral).
    *   Contemplating the **mind** in the mind (its states and qualities).
    *   Contemplating **phenomena** in phenomena (mental objects, like the hindrances).
    *   This is done with ardent awareness, putting aside "covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world" (i.e., stopping rumination about past/future social interactions).

4.  **Practical, Accessible Dharma:** The entire tone is one of demystification and empowerment:
    *   **Immediate & Verifiable:** The Dharma is presented as a direct, here-and-now science of mind that anyone can test. Happiness is found not in gaining something, but in the **absence of dukkha** (suffering/stress) created by the hindrances.
    *   **Self-Reliance:** They stress that you don't need a perfect guru or years of study. The Dhamma is inherent in reality; a teacher or friend is helpful, but the truth must be seen for oneself.
    *   **Simple Techniques:** The primary tool is **returning to the breath**. When a hindrance arises, one can simply notice it ("Aha, I see you, Mara!"), feel the joy of that recognition, and return to mindful breathing to relax the body and gladden the mind.
    *   **Joyful and Playful:** The practice is framed as a fun, investigative play—enjoying the "show" of sensations, feelings, and mind states without identifying with them.

5.  **The Result: Freedom Here and Now:** The talk culminates in a description of the fruit of practice:
    *   A profound shift from seeking happiness *in* things to finding happiness as the **foundation** from which life is lived.
    *   A sense of being the "wealthiest" or most fulfilled person, regardless of material circumstances, because happiness is internal and independent.
    *   A deep gratitude for encountering the Dharma and the supportive friendship of the Sangha.

### **Overall Tone & Message**

The talk is informal, enthusiastic, and relatable. It seeks to strip away cultural and religious baggage to present the core of the Buddha's teaching as a practical, effective, and immediately rewarding path to end suffering. The message is one of hope and confidence: the hindrances that cause misery are clearly defined, and a clear, wholesome path (mindfulness) is available to overcome them, leading to genuine peace and happiness.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several metaphors and stories to illustrate their points about Buddhist practice and the hindrances to enlightenment. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors:**

1.  **"Buddhist form of the same Christian church" / "Outer packaging"**: Speaker A uses this to criticize ritualistic, devotional practices in some Buddhist settings, comparing statues of the Buddha to crucifixes and bowing to prayer. He suggests the core "authentic spiritual practice" is what matters, not the "outer packaging."

2.  **"Heap of the unwholesome" / "Heap of garbage"**: This is a direct metaphor from the sutta (SN 47.5) for the **Five Hindrances** (sensual desire, ill will, sloth & torpor, restlessness & remorse, doubt). Speaker A elaborates by calling it a "heap of garbage" one can pull themselves out of.

3.  **"Dukkha pie"**: Speaker B uses this playful metaphor to describe how the hindrances often come mixed together as part of the same experience of suffering (*dukkha*).

4.  **"Snake in the grass"**: Speaker A describes spotting a hindrance (like doubt) as seeing a "snake in the grass" that you can triumphantly grab by the head. This turns the hindrance from a saboteur into a conquered enemy.

5.  **"Aha, I see you, Mara"**: This is a common Buddhist metaphorical personification. **Mara** represents temptation, death, and obstructive forces. Spotting a hindrance is likened to seeing and overcoming Mara's tricks.

6.  **"Going to the gym"**: Speaker A uses this metaphor for the Dharma practice. You don't get "ripped" (enlightened) after one session; it requires consistent practice and effort to see results.

7.  **"Holding up a lamp in the darkness"**: This is a reference to a classic simile from the suttas (which Speaker A paraphrases). The Dharma is like a lamp that illuminates the truth for those who are lost in the darkness of ignorance.

8.  **"Bag of beans"**: Used to describe the body when seen with clear mindfulness—not as a self, but as a collection of sensations, an "inanimate" aggregate.

9.  **"Sun shining on a cloud"**: Speaker A uses this to describe how clear awareness (mindfulness) acts on negative feelings. The awareness is the sun, and the negative feeling is a cloud that dissipates under its light.

10. **"Pincer effect"**: Speaker B mentions this metaphor (attributed to their teacher Dhammarato) for how focusing on the mind and body together can "pinch" or resolve feelings.

11. **"Emperor of the universe"**: Speaker A references Papaji's saying to describe the unsurpassed, independent happiness that comes from inner fulfillment, regardless of worldly circumstances.

12. **"Cutting out the middleman"**: Speaker B uses this to describe how the Dharma allows happiness to come directly from letting go of craving, rather than through acquiring external objects.

### **Stories & Anecdotes:**

1.  **The Illusion of News-Induced Anger**: Speaker A tells a story about how reading the news can create ill will and hatred toward groups, even though those events are not part of one's direct experience. It's a story of "dreaming yourself up into a state of hate" and suffering as a result.

2.  **The SWAT Team Knock**: To illustrate that sloth and torpor are not permanent states, Speaker A gives the hypothetical story of a SWAT team breaking down your door. The sudden adrenaline would instantly cut through the dullness, proving the energy is latent within.

3.  **The Reckless Driving/ Snowboard Jumps**: Speaker A uses his own personal history of risky behavior as a story to highlight the gratitude and joy of simply being alive and able to breathe in the present moment.

4.  **Nisargadatta Maharaj's "Night Watchman"**: Speaker A quotes Nisargadatta's story to emphasize that outer life and status (like being a night watchman) are unimportant compared to inner peace, which must be earned through practice.

5.  **Digging a Well**: This is part of the Nisargadatta quote used as an analogy for discarding all that you are not (thoughts, feelings, etc.) to reach the pure "water" of your true nature—awareness itself.

6.  **"Aunt Susie"**: Speaker A briefly references a common teaching story from Dhammarato about ruminating on past social interactions (e.g., "What did Aunt Susie mean by that?"), which is an example of "covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world."

7.  **The Two Monks and the Women**: Speaker B references a well-known Buddhist parable (often about monks and a woman at a river) to make the point that one can appreciate beauty ("I like this") without craving or clinging to it ("but I don't want it").

8.  **The Fall and Return to Practice**: Both speakers share the relatable story of their own cyclical journey: finding the Dharma, getting enthusiastic, falling away into worldly pursuits, suffering, and then rediscovering the Dharma. This is framed as a normal and even "beautiful" imperfection in the path.

9.  **Ramana Maharshi's Enlightenment**: Speaker A alludes to the story of Ramana Maharshi's spontaneous awakening as a teenager, triggered by a sudden, intense fear of death. This serves as an example of enlightenment happening outside the Buddhist framework through other causes and conditions.

10. **The Handcrafted Furniture**: Speaker A uses the image of handcrafted furniture having beautiful imperfections to argue for the beauty found in the flaws and cycles of a practitioner's life, as opposed to a notion of sterile, machine-like perfection.

These metaphors and stories collectively serve to demystify Buddhist concepts, make them relatable to modern experience, encourage practice, and warn against dogmatic or purely ritualistic approaches.
