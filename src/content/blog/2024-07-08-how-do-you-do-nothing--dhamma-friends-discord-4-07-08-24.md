### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, so it's another conversation between Pooh and Christopher Robin, and Pooh is expressing to Christopher Robin how the best thing he likes is visiting Christopher Robin. And then so Christopher Robin says, I like that too, said Christopher Robin, but what I like doing best is nothing. How do you do nothing? asked Pooh after he wondered for a long time. Well, it's when people call— it's when people call out at you just as you're going off to do it, 'What are you going to do, Christopher Robin?' and you say, 'Oh, nothing,' and then you go and do it. 'Oh, I see,' said Pooh. This is a nothing sort of thing that we're doing now. 'Oh, I see,' said Pooh again. It means just going along, listening to all the things you can't hear, and not bothering. So that's the whole little section I wanted to read to you guys. Really reminds me of the way that Dhammarato teaches the Dharma. So I have some thoughts on it, but if anybody had some thoughts on that little quote, I'll invite you guys to share that first. Can you repeat it? I can, sure. I'll read a little faster this time. All right.

**Speaker B:** So.

**Speaker A:** Pooh tells Christopher Robin his favorite thing is to visit him, and then Christopher Robin says, I like that too, but what I like doing best is nothing. How do you do nothing? asked Pooh after he wondered for a long time. Well, it's when people call out at you just as you're going off to do it. What are you going to do, Christopher Robin? And you say, oh, nothing. And then you go and do it. Oh, I see, said Pooh. This is a nothing sort of thing that we're doing now. Oh, I see, said Pooh again. It means just going along, listening to all the things you can't hear, and not bothering. It's a good poo Dharma. And the reason that it— well, that's— it's funny because my wife actually gave it to me and I was like, that's perfect. But the reason I thought it was perfect is because everybody who approaches the Dhamma comes to the Dharma, you know, really bringing all of the worldly habits that they've already had with them. And, you know, the way of the world is doing things to get things, placing your happiness in some object, right? When I get the house, when I get the car, when I get the job, when I get my college degree, I guess going back and further, when I finish kindergarten, when I finish elementary school, when I'm done with school, then I'll be happy. So happiness is always at the end of some goal or some achievement. And then we come to— and so that's what Buddhadasa called materialism, right? The way of materialism, where we believe that happiness or freedom or joy comes at the end of some material pursuit, some concrete objective pursuit in the world. And then we encounter either an experience, we we have some kind of painful experience or suffering to a certain degree, or we have some kind of big mystical experience, or we just encounter a teaching and it gives rise to a non-material feeling, and then we start pursuing that. And then the teaching tells us, yeah, the world is not where happiness lies. Here are these things that we can offer in the case of Buddhism. Things like Jhana, things like stream entry, things like Arhatship, things like Nibbana. And then we take that through our worldly mind and we turn those ideas into objects. And then we then seek those things, we seek those non-material things. And we basically go from a material pursuit to a spiritual material pursuit. So we call that spiritual materialism. And then we come to a good teacher like Dhammarato, and he tells us actually, this path that you're on is a path made up of nothing, leading nowhere, and then there's nothing at the end of it. And what's really at the end of it is just being satisfied with things as they are, right? And he tells us like not to make things up, not to take our experience and make something out of it. You know, we take our experiences, and we make it good or we make it bad. And then we want to keep experiencing the good and avoid the bad, but then we're stuck in this cycle of craving and clinging. And what, you know, Christopher Robin is saying is simply settle into experience itself and don't bother it. Like Ajahn Chah says, right? Says the sound doesn't bother you, you bother the sound. Not bothering is just another way of saying not craving and clinging. And really, that's the whole practice. That's the summary of the Dhamma. It's just to let things be exactly as they are. Don't cook them up, as Ajahn Buddhadasa would say. He would say that, you know, we take the phenomena of the world and we cook it up, we turn it into something. And if we just leave it as it is, then everything is okay exactly as it is. And that's what this path of satisfaction is all about. It's about letting things be as they are without having to turn them into anything, without having to objectify them into a material pursuit or into a spiritual pursuit, without having to figure out exactly what it is that we are or what we're looking for or what achievement is going to make us happy. It's really just about giving all of that up and stopping right here and being happy right here where we are. And that's the super mundane Dharma. Supra mundane Dharma, not super mundane. Those are my thoughts on Puja. And I'll leave it there for now. If there's any questions or comments in the group.

**Speaker C:** Oh, well, the quote was basically he likes to do nothing, right? And when meditating, a lot of times you're trying to do something, like you're trying to achieve a state of meditation, or you're trying to meditate, or you're like— but it's all about not doing anything and just like experiencing and being. And it's like when you're trying to do something, it's something that'll be achieved in the future. But it's more about being happy the way things are right now. So like when you're not doing, that brings you closer to being, right? So that's sort of like a meditation sort of look on that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I would say that that's accurate the way you put it. There's mistakes that people make in what they call like do-nothing meditations, which I'm not sure if that's what you're describing, but the mistake people make is in doing nothing, right? Because then you're still doing something. You're trying to do nothing, but really what it takes is just a shift in perspective. Which is to understand that if we just allow things to be as they are, then things settle into a natural state of peace and happiness. So we don't have to do nothing. We can do whatever we want as long as we allow things to be what they are and keep watch over the mind. Essentially, how is the mind responding to the activities of nature? I like to think of everything as the activity of nature. The Buddha talks about the khandhas. The Five Khandhas, these are five categories of experience, or five ways we experience experience. I just like to think of it as nature. And if we have an attitude of just allowing things to be as they are, seeing things through the lens of dependent origination, through, you know, understanding that there's nothing static or stable in nature, everything is part of a dynamic process that's constantly changing. The second that we have a craving or a clinging, we try to solidify nature into an object, and that object is already no longer there, because it's only a concept in the mind that we've made. And that's where Dukkha comes from, trying to solidify or objectify this dynamic process of nature. So that doing nothing is really an undoing of our habits of objectifying the world and accepting that things are sort of just happening. Everything in the body is happening. The blood is flowing. The air is coming in and out. You know, thoughts are arising and passing. Feelings and sensations are arising and passing throughout the body. Sounds are arising and passing, arising out of silence and settling back into silence again. They rise, they endure, they cease. Thoughts arise and endure and cease. And having that perspective of not grasping and clinging at one particular sight, sound, sensation, thought, or feeling, essentially just allowing everything to continuously be as it is, then no suffering is created. The term Sukkha Aditti, that first fetter that the Buddha talks about, the actual word itself means the belief in something permanent in the five aggregates. Essentially, it's a little bit interpretive way of looking at it, but the reason the Buddha teaches the five aggregates and the four foundations of mindfulness is when we look at these different groups of experience we can see that they're each independent processes. They're all constantly changing. None of them are stable or static. And allowing the world to be that way, you know, makes everything okay exactly as it is already right now. Because the now is this constant unfolding. And So if you think of Nibbana or Jhana or Srotapanna or Sakadagami or Anagami or Arhat as something in the future, then though these terms do refer to actual sort of differences in experience that you can look back on, if you make these things goals, then you are only generating craving towards concepts that you've created in the mind. So that's the mistake that we make a lot in practice.

**Speaker D:** The fetters become sticky.

**Speaker A:** What's that?

**Speaker D:** The fetters become sticky like flypaper in those cases. Time.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I guess I can jump in now. Something I like to mention is letting things be as they are is inseparably linked to a term in the Pali that's pretty much the same phrase, but the beginning is different. So yatha bhutta nirodha, jnāna-dās��a. And the translation of this is knowledge and vision of things as they actually are. So knowledge and vision of things as they actually are is like a fancy way of saying seeing clearly now that there's no problems, nothing to worry about. So as a byproduct of that knowledge, that everything's okay. Everything becomes okay. My boss is calling me.

**Speaker D:** Sorry.

**Speaker E:** That's okay.

**Speaker A:** Good demonstration of Anicca.

**Speaker F:** Impermanence. I have something to add about the do nothing technique. Well, It's a technique. It can be looked at that the instructions that I got from Shinzen Young, he says whenever you have the intention to change your attention, drop that intention. And the second thing to do is let whatever happened happen. So it's like a non-doing, but there's a little bit of doing involved with that particular technique. I think there's different ways to do non-doing.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I think Anapanasati is non-doing.

**Speaker A:** The do-nothing is really misleading because we do a lot of doing here, right? We, in fact, the element of choice, as I see it in the Buddhist teaching, is very heavy on karma, not in the sense of the magical karma machine, as Dhammarato likes to, as Dharma likes to call it, the Kamma machine in the sky. But that we actually do have the ability to make choices.

**Speaker C:** But.

**Speaker A:** Choice is something that is on a sliding scale, essentially. For one, it's not completely free, right? We can only choose out of the pool of experiences and knowledges that we've had in our conditioning. And every time a new concept comes into the mind, a new choice is then available. But it's dependent on that concept or understanding. But the ability to actually choose, the ability to actually change one's relationship to the world, to change your attitude, to make the decision to be happy now, despite what circumstances arise, that's something, you know, if we look at it through the Pali text, that's something that actually comes with stream entry, right? Before stream entry, if we're going to use that framework, just for the sake of conversation at the moment, we live our lives at the mercy of unconscious evolutionary drives that the Buddha calls craving. Right? The mind runs towards what is pleasant, it runs away from what is unpleasant, and it spins around what is neutral, or what is neither pleasant or unpleasant, because it's used to chasing what feels good and running away from what feels bad. It gets confused and indecisive about what is neutral, it gets doubtful. And we're completely subject to our conditioning, because we don't we don't have enough mindfulness and wisdom to know that we can actually, you know, take a look and make a change, as Dhammarato puts it. The Noble Eightfold Path that follows the, you know, the first three of the Four Noble Truths comes about from seeing conditionality, right? And this is that knowledge that allows us to start choosing. But we have to know sort of where we can make a change. And we can't change nature, but we can change our internal response to nature. Pretty much all of the Buddhist teachings are about internal phenomena. So when the Buddha talks about renunciation, he's talking about renouncing craving and clinging towards an object. When you renounce craving and clinging towards an object, the object naturally falls away. You don't actually have to If you keep your craving and clinging and just deny yourself the object, then as Dhammarato says, you try to keep the rule and then you resent it. It builds more Dukkha. There's not much freedom in that. So yeah, the point I'm making here is that we are continuously making choices in this practice. We're no longer allowing ourselves to be dragged around by craving and clinging, by greed, hatred, and delusion. Instead, we're using the knowledge that we gain from these interactions, from talking to Dhammarato, from reading the Dhamma, from reading the suttas, from our practice, from talking to our Dharma friends. We use the knowledge that we gain to add to that pool of choice. And then we use mindfulness to remember that knowledge, and wisdom or discernment to know exactly where and when we can apply that knowledge. You know, and then to put it simply, it's just to continuously remind ourselves not to make problems out of the way things are, to continuously remind ourselves that every problem that we have, every negative feeling that we have, every belief that we carry as a hang-up is something that we've been convincing ourselves of our entire lives because somebody else convinced us of it. And not only do we habitually convince ourselves of that because somebody else convinced us of it, also that with which we identify. We identify with our stories and our narratives, and we don't want to give them up because that's where our identity is. Identities like, you know, you know, I'm my— my— one of my bosses hates Pearl Jam. She can't stand to listen to Pearl Jam, you know. She'll never listen to how good Pearl Jam is. Anyway, that's a minor example. But the point is, is that we see how the stories we've been telling ourselves our whole lives that we grasp and cling to because it's part of our identity, or because a part of our cultural narrative, or because we don't know that we can't do otherwise. We see that As Dhammarato puts it, we've been talking ourselves into feeling bad our whole lives. This is one of the biggest challenges he gets from new students. If I tell myself everything's okay, if I tell myself, you know, it's a beautiful day, everything is fine, not a worry in the world, no problems, aren't I just lying to myself? Well, no, you're not lying to yourself. You've been lying to yourself your whole life into making yourself feel terrible, feel like you can't be happy or shouldn't be happy until you get what you need to, what you think you need. And now you're introducing sort of a counter-narrative to undo all of those lies. And the idea that everything is already okay brings you much closer to the truth of reality. And then when you get to the point where you start feeling that, yeah, everything really is okay, everything is okay exactly as it is, you're sort of right there, right there in a very calm, clear, happy mind. And then even that thought, it is no longer necessary. Essentially, you just can allow things to be as they are. Then you get these nice gaps where you're just resting with things as they are. You don't have to keep cultivating these wholesome thoughts. But then when the hindrances come back up, all those negative mental habits, talking ourselves into feeling bad, comes back up again. We remind ourselves, no, no, no, everything's okay. No worries, no problems. The spring comes and the grass grows all by itself, that kind of stuff. And then the mind settles back down, becomes clear, and then you can allow things to be as they are again. So, so there's a lot of choice in that. That's the main point I'm making here.

**Speaker C:** I just had a quick question. You talked about remembering to stay present and to be kind to yourself. Do you ever practice forgetting everything that's not present until all that's left is what is present?

**Speaker A:** Great question. And the way you put it is interesting. What you're describing is what in early Buddhism is called Sunyata, right?

**Speaker E:** Right?

**Speaker A:** In early Buddhism, if you look at the Jula Sunyata Sutta, the Buddha starts by saying, you know, when a monk comes to a forest, and he sits down, and he just pays attention to the forest, I'm paraphrasing, he pays attention to what is not there. And this is the disturbance that was dependent on what is not there. So when you're sitting in a forest, you notice the absence of the village because they have come back from alms, right? So when the monk comes to the forest, he notices, okay, there's no village here. And the disturbance that was dependent on the perception of village is also not here, right? And that's his first entry into emptiness, is what the Buddha says. And then it goes through layers and layers and layers. It starts on the outside, and then it goes, you know, through perceptions of different aspects of the body, and then different activities of perception. But what the Buddha is saying is that emptiness in that regard— uses emptiness in one other way, and they released it— does. But emptiness in that regard is what in modern times we call radical phenomenology, meaning that the mind only tends to the presence or absence of phenomena. So our normal way of being is that we're always carrying experiences outside this moment in this experience, and the disturbance is dependent on those experiences. So if I just walked into this garage to have this Sangha call, but previously, you know, I got into a fight with a family member and Anicca, a non-emptiness would be I'm talking to you guys, but I'm sitting here thinking about that, and I'm experiencing the Dukkha that depends on that perception. But the emptiness of that perception is I'm not thinking about that, I'm only paying attention to what I'm saying to you guys, and I'm noticing that since that perception is absent, the Dukkha dependent on that perception is also absent. So you're training the mind to notice that that experience is only made up of phenomena, right, which is what the mind has constructed in experience, and that we habitually include irrelevant phenomena in our experience from the past, from the future, carrying the past, worrying about the future, goals in the practice, judgments about ourselves, judgments about the world. That's all that non-emptiness, right? So emptiness is quite radical in early Buddhism because what it is, is it's an extreme presence, as you put it, of forgetting, right? Meaning that the mind is not holding what's not here. It's an absence of what's not here. And that is a really, really powerful practice. So that's how I would respond to that. Go ahead, Brett.

**Speaker D:** There can be an experience too where the mind acquires a subtlety, either temporarily or after some time, where it will just spontaneously drop objects that aren't necessary for the present moment. So you might be sitting at the table waiting for food somewhere or just at the dinner table, and you'll just perceive just the tabletop. There are things we'll just simplify on whatever sense door is prevalent. I don't know if this is something you can speak about. It's lovely though.

**Speaker E:** I've gotten a bunch of more new—.

**Speaker G:** So normally whenever I go to the supermarket I always have like a routine where I like buy the same stuff.

**Speaker D:** Over and over again.

**Speaker G:** I don't know if this is related, but I normally get the same type of herb tea, and I've noticed that like, I don't know if like habits cause or like a form of craving or something, but I've always, I've sort of just started noticing stuff like that more. And now whenever I go to the supermarket, I actually get a new thing of tea every time. So it's been very fun. I've been noticing that like I actually don't have to do the same routine every single day. And I've been switching it up, but like sometimes it's been really drastic. Like I was about to sit down to like watch TV and I was like, wait, this is craving. I like chucked my remote at like my sofa.

**Speaker H:** And.

**Speaker G:** Like it's been interesting. People think I'm weird now. It's like the bottom.

**Speaker E:** Line. Yeah, there's many, many people that think it's insane to be happy, satisfied.

**Speaker B:** Weirdly enough, the world is miserable. So you'll stick out like a sore thumb.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, everyone thinks I'm weird now.

**Speaker G:** It's so sad. I mean, it's not really like sad, but it's just interesting.

**Speaker B:** Who cares what the world's gonna say? Because you know, they're gonna say it anyway.

**Speaker A:** You know, you know how Dhammarato says.

**Speaker B:** 8 worldly wins, uh, gain and loss, fame, or is it 4?

**Speaker A:** Praise and blame, praise and repute, fame and disrepute.

**Speaker B:** So these are the wins that are going to go up and down, and no matter how good, no matter how good of a person, how good you do owning up to your mistakes, you people are going to love you, all of a sudden they're going to hate you.

**Speaker A:** Okay?

**Speaker B:** And this is not self, not me, not my problem. You know, something to remember. You're in this world, but you're not of the world.

**Speaker A:** Um, you know how Dhammarato says— this used to drive me crazy, and maybe I'm making up my own interpretation here, but I think it's correct. Um, you know how Dhammarato says he challenges the narrative, those who don't work don't eat. Here's how I interpret that now. People believe that you can't have anything without having earned it. And the number one thing that people don't believe that you should have without having earned it is happiness. If you walk around being happy for no reason at all, it's going to offend everybody you meet. And if you tell people that you're happy for no reason at all, it's going to confuse them, it's going to catch them off balance. Um, Anagami, with suspicion. Um, yeah, but also I think in the beginning when you start to feel this freedom and this happiness that is causeless, because really in my opinion that's what the Dhamma is, it's, it's the understanding that true happiness is causeless, that, you know, as, um, Anya Kundanya realized is the first one to express that phrase. When the Dhamma eye opened, that anything arising from a cause is subject to cessation. So that basically just that one insight, if it's full and complete, the mind will completely put down the world because it'll realize that nothing whatsoever is worth holding on to, because nothing that arises from a cause lasts for more than a second, really. And not just that, but the pleasure that you have towards an object is extremely impermanent. So that one insight is the core transformative insight in the Dhamma. All things that arise from a cause, including your pleasure towards an object, is subject to cessation. All things subject to arising are subject to cessation. And the realization of the Dhamma is the deathless, the birthless, the timeless, right? It doesn't arise from a cause. And when we put down our craving and clinging and we see what's left, we see that there's just this deep upwelling of happiness. But it's not the happiness that we've been talking about our whole lives that comes when you gain a desired object. It's just this completely unreasonable, causeless joy, delight, sense of lightness, right? Desirelessness, this freedom. There's no tension in the body, there's no tension in the mind. Whatever you do, you do because you need to do it, not because you're being pushed towards it by desire. And that's the delight in the Dhamma. And that's not the way— that the reason that this is so profound is is because that's just not the way that the world has worked all of this time. It's not the way evolution has designed us. Right. And, and so it confuses people. But what I was going to say in regard to what you're talking about, Shamile, what came up is that at first when we experience this, we kind of want to like splash it around, you know what I mean? And that can be kind of rude, actually. That actually can be kind of rude. And because we eventually need to get to a point where we don't need to like splash our happiness all over people, we need to kind of, you know, we can be happy and not allow ourselves to be pulled into other people's Dukkha, but we don't have to make a show about it. And that we can sort of be sort of like a calm open space people are comfortable around that, right? They're comfortable around a sense of spaciousness. But, you know, it's totally normal in the beginning when you've sort of been a slave to moods and habits and you start to experience that freedom to really want to show it off, you know. And I think that's sort of the stage where you start to get negative reactions from people. But that starts to subside And you'll find that everywhere you go, people are comfortable around you. People are smiling at you. People want to talk to you. They want to be around you. Dogs want to be around you.

**Speaker B:** Dogs is the funniest one for sure.

**Speaker A:** Especially— yeah, I'll leave that.

**Speaker B:** That's usually just want to fuck off and have nothing to do with you, but they might even come up to you and circle around your legs, purr a little bit.

**Speaker D:** They might come when you fall. Some cats.

**Speaker B:** Some cats, yeah.

**Speaker F:** My cats know when I'm meditating and they come up to me.

**Speaker B:** They know, right?

**Speaker A:** Right, yeah.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, they know when I'm in a meditative state, they want to be around it. But that's weird about state. Like an alternate state of consciousness, how I view. Sometimes I'm in a meditative state and other times, you know, I'm not. And then there's like craving for it. But then I laugh that away. I guess that's part of the path. Maybe with time it'll go away.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, in the past I've fantasize that California was a meditative state, maybe attain some state, but nah.

**Speaker A:** States are things that are subject to arising and therefore subject to passing away. So states are not things that you want to identify with or cling to, you know. You don't— I think of it as standpoint. They have this concept in social science of standpoint. It's sort of where the locus of your— it's where your sense of self is, kind of. But Ajahn Chah talks about this, and I'm trying to remember what talk it was. I think it was either The Path of Peace or The Way Things Are. But Ajahn Chah talks about, you know, mental states are part of those Eight Worldly Winds that including meditative mental states that Scott was talking about, you know, the last one being happiness and sadness. Any positive experience falls under the category of happiness or pleasure. I would say pleasure and displeasure is a better translation because I think of happiness as being what we experience when we actually understand the Dhamma, being that causeless joy. But yeah, states, mental states, meditative states, are things that are subject to arising, that things that are conditioned. You know, this is the fourth tetrad of Anapanasati. You spend the first tetrad calming the body and realizing that the breath is the body conditioner, and by tranquilizing the breathing, you tranquilize the body. And then that gives rise to pleasant feeling, Piti and Sukkha. And then that pleasant feeling calms and clarifies the mind, and then you'll get the realization that feeling is the mind conditioner, right? That's the first 3 tetrads now. And that's where we start to understand how to sort of purposefully give rise to certain conditions in the mind. But where the insight comes is in that 4th tetrad. And that's what the whole path of the Buddha is in the Anapanasati Sutta. And that 4th tetrad The 13th step is to contemplate Anicca, and that is understanding that everything that's subject to arising is subject to cessation, knowing things, knowing that whatever arises due to a cause is subject to cessation. So the tranquility of the body, its relationship with the breath, the breath itself, different feeling tones in the mind, the Piti, the Sukkha, you know, just the whole relationship between all of those foundations of mindfulness. And when impermanence is understood deeply, that's sort of the doorway into the Dhamma, right? That's the doorway into understanding dependent origination, understanding that nothing that arises due to a cause is permanent. And so that's the perception of Anicca. And that gives rise to dispassion. That's the 14th contemplation in Anapanasati. Dispassion is when you no longer have passion for something. Passion is what gives rise to the sense of self. It's what gives rise to the world. So that dispassion leads to cessation, Nirodha. That's the cessation of clinging. And the Buddha summarizes suffering as these five aggregates are constituents of experience afflicted by clinging. So dispassion leads to the cessation of clinging that leads to nature just being nature. And then that finally leads to renunciation. Buddhadasa calls it throwing back. That's when the mind gives everything back to nature. The way he describes it is we realize we've been thieves our whole life. We've been assuming our experience, taking it as ours, right? And we realize that everything belongs to nature. Nature is this dynamic, ever-changing process. We give it all back. And then that giving it all back leads the mind through the seven factors of awakening, culminating in knowledge and deliverance, which is that final liberation where all the burdens are put down, just the fetters being broken. So that's what the Buddha is referring to when he talks about the deathless. It's when the mind doesn't generate any type of craving or clinging. So it doesn't matter what worldly mental state arises and passes. It doesn't matter what Jhana or meditative mental state arises and passes. It doesn't matter if someone says something nice to you or something terrible to you. Everything is always already okay exactly as it is. And that's that coolness, that coolness of Nibbana. It's when you've just put everything down. There's no questions that need to be answered. There's no objects that need to be acquired. There's no meditative state that needs to be cultivated, there's no attainment on the path that needs to be gained. All of it gets put down.

**Speaker C:** So what you're talking about, there is not a state?

**Speaker A:** What the Buddha refers to as the deathless is when the mind doesn't bother, the mind doesn't make things, it just allows everything to be as it is. So I mean, nature continues to flow as it is. It's, it's, and states continue to come and go, of course, it's just that the clinging, the the clinging that doesn't arise. What's referred to as birth and death in the Dhamma arises out of craving and clinging, right? So when craving and clinging no longer arise, that's what— that's what the— I mean, there's, um, in the Udana, when the Buddha talks about the unborn, there's another Udana soon after that where he defines the unborn as non-greed, non-hatred, and non-delusion. So it's when, um, I mean, it translates best. I mean, these things can sound kind of cryptic, but really it amounts to being okay with things as they are, right? Not wanting things to be different than they are, not wanting things to be, you know, not wanting to get rid of what is. The mind remains in a state of sort of perfect kind of peace with the way things are. But because of that, because of that level of satisfaction, no Dukkha arises. So then everything actually is okay. You know, that makes sense.

**Speaker D:** Thank you, Michael. I wanted to rewind, if I could, us back to the arrival of Piti, Sukkha, and the first Jhana. And the reason why is In the experience of some practice, some students may find it useful to note, as Dhamma Vidhu did, that we may not know Dukkha until we've experienced its disappearance, even temporarily, when the mind rises above the five hindrances. And that experience of Vipassana, of seclusion, can be a unique one. In fact, it can be the first time we feel that in our entire lives. And in the experience here, and I cannot speak for everyone or anyone else, but perhaps someone could say some things, but in the experience here, the Arisal of Piti, Sukkha coincides with the joy of the disappearance of those five hindrances, those irritants, because they are irritants. And we may not realize that if we've been living for decades as feeding off our own mind's deception and pain. And again, you know, I'm attempting to describe the unfolding of practice. Which we might experience as we train the mind. It might not be—.

**Speaker A:** What you described, right, is that it's accurate, obviously, because this is why Piti is so intense and it doesn't last very long, you know. It's, it's The Buddha uses several similes for Piti, which is like being free of debt, being let out of jail, right? Um, that's the hindrances. When the hindrances cease, there's this feeling of rapture, this feeling of bliss, a feeling of success, as Dhammarato says. Um, when we've been able to put the hindrances down or put them to sleep, um, there's this, there's this experience of strong joy, liberation, you know. It's like, yeah, you know, like when you're a teenager and you get let out of school at the beginning of the summer and you're like, yeah, you just start running, you know. That's Piti. And then it settles down into Sukkha, and then the hindrances come back and you're like not enjoying your summer.

**Speaker D:** School's out for summer!

**Speaker A:** Hell yeah, right?

**Speaker D:** That song, maybe it's, maybe it's just my generation.

**Speaker A:** No, yeah, no, I'm familiar.

**Speaker F:** Rock on, brother.

**Speaker D:** Ghoul's out, and you can't rock on harder than that.

**Speaker A:** Well, I'm looking at so many icons without specific questions, I can just continuously fill in the void with my voice. So I would love, especially if there's any new friends here, to hear if there's any questions, like, you know, specific questions about practice that anybody wants to kind of put out for all of us to comment on that could be helpful to anybody here.

**Speaker C:** I'd love to know your opinion on recommendation on how to increase your mindfulness? Like, would it be mostly meditation, or do you follow certain practices? Or like, what would be like if I wanted to increase my mind, like baseline state, what would I do?

**Speaker A:** I felt like Michael Clark was going to answer that one. I don't know if I was just looking too hard there.

**Speaker E:** I was looking to see who our new guests are. I'm going to call you guys out here. We've got Kit, The Fiend, Eddie's kind of new still. Yeah, if any of you, you know, any rude— if any of you guys have questions or topics you'd like to talk about. Yeah, go ahead, bring them up. Don't be shy now.

**Speaker A:** But yeah, so Dream Destroyer asked a question about mindfulness, how to increase mindfulness. It's a good question. This is a good question for me since, um, despite many decades of practice, the ADHD-ness of this brain is still quite strong. But, you know, mindfulness, properly translated, is memory, essentially. And so memory functions at different levels of experience. The world is wiggly, right? Nature is just They say that 50 million bits of information pour through the senses every second, but we only consciously experience 50 of those, right? So that's a very small percentage. So the organism is processing all of this data from whatever reality is, and based on, you know, in Buddhist language, craving, that's what's selected as experience. But what stitches together sensory experience— Dhammarato likes to use the example of the old movie reels, right? It's like, what is it, 12 frames per second, the old ones? And then the new ones are like 24 frames per second to make it look like a moving picture for us. So our senses are taking in bits of information, and then it's the function of memory sensory memory, they call it, that puts that together. So that sensory memory that gives solidity to sensory experience, and then working memory is what gives continuity to experience. It's working memory is what makes it so that when you take a step, you don't forget the last step, like you're not constantly lost. Essentially, without working memory, you'd be constantly lost. The kind of thing that gets degraded in certain diseases with old age. And then long-term memory is what stores experiences in certain narratives in your mind and gives you a sense of continuity throughout your life. So mindfulness, or Sati, it refers to memory. And in the beginning, it's a little bit more like working memory. Where we're adding more attention to what we're doing, right, to what the body is doing, to what feeling, the realm of feeling, is doing, to what mental states are happening, and to what thoughts are appearing and disappearing in the mind. So just as an example, I have a family member who's very unmindful, I'll say. He's extremely moody. He doesn't notice the negative thoughts that lead to the bad moods, and he doesn't notice the negative words and actions that come out of his bad moods. And he doesn't notice the fact that he's doing this in a cyclical way. So mindfulness is necessary to sort of break our habitual tendencies, right? The fact that if somebody insults us or challenges us, we'll get angry. They say, "He pushed my buttons." The fact that we have buttons is because we're unmindful. If you're properly mindful, if you have enough mindfulness and wisdom, all of those buttons will go away because you'll notice that you have these triggers. And instead of unconsciously allowing these to be buttons or triggers, then you'll see sort of the patterns of activity that are like when you stub your toe and you get angry. If you're mindful when you stub your toe, you'll notice the sensation. Maybe it actually feels like pain, some tension in the body. You'll let it go. You don't let it turn into anger. You won't beat the hell out of the chair that you stub your toe on. If you're a parent and your kid's not listening, going back to my family member who— you'll let yourself get in a bad mood and then start speaking terribly to your child. And going in and out of these moods. So mindfulness is sort of remembering to pay attention to what the body is doing, to what the feelings are doing, to what the mind is doing, the mental states, the thoughts, so that we're not just unconsciously being driven by these patterns. So to increase mindfulness, you know, you just keep reminding yourself to pay attention to what you're doing. But at a certain point in practice, this mindfulness changes to not just that, but to remembering the Dhamma, especially after stream entry. It's remembering the vision of the Dhamma, because you can actually forget it. It'll go deep inside you, but you can forget it. You have to bring it back to mind. So in the practice here, that level of mindfulness would be remembering that everything's already okay, constantly reminding yourself that everything's already okay. When you start to feel like you're in a bad mood and, oh, I'm not practicing well, just, oh, wait a minute, that's just a mental state. Actually, everything's okay. That's mindfulness. You're reminding yourself of that. And so to strengthen it, to answer your question more specifically, it's to do it whenever you remember to do it and to remember not to punish yourself when you forget. And, you know, so it's just a A continuity of remembering, remembering what you're doing, remembering to look at how the mind is responding to what you're doing, remembering to look at how the mind is responding to experience. If you go to work and the boss yells at you, remember to watch how the body and the mind are responding to that rather than just reacting. When you eat too much food and you get tired, remembering to watch what the body does instead of letting that tiredness just turn into a bad mood. Right? It's becoming conscious and continuously remembering to be conscious of what's happening. Go ahead, Brett.

**Speaker D:** And to do so and to remember not to pass judgment while you're doing that and not to create extra tension to become hypervigilant in your awareness.

**Speaker A:** That's an important point, remembering not to pass judgment.

**Speaker C:** Okay, thanks. I appreciate your explanation.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, when you look at the Satipatthana Sutta, it makes it look like it's object-oriented, like, but really the foundations of mindfulness are just like mnemonic devices. So when the Buddha is like, you know, be mindful when standing, when bedding, when reaching, sitting, when urinating and defecating. It's not like, it's not like you have to be aware of every sensation that happens as the body moves. It's just that in each of those activities, mindfulness is present. When the breath is coming in and going out, when the body is moving, when it's standing, it's remembering to, to bring wisdom to the point of contact. This is the way Buddhadasa explains it, that mindfulness goes and fetches wisdom. You have a store of wisdom, you go and it fetches it and brings it to the point of contact. And when mindfulness brings wisdom to the point of contact effectively, that's Sapanasati, that's clear comprehension. So just an easy example would be, let's say you have an old habit that you broke. Okay, let's say you got really drunk on your 21st birthday and you woke up the next day completely hungover, and the whole day you had a headache and you could barely see you straight. It was just awful. And you said to yourself, I'm not going to drink again, that was an awful experience. And a couple weeks later, you've forgotten about that awful hangover, and your friend calls you and says, do you want to go to the bar? Do you want to go to the bar? That's the point of contact. Remembering the hangover is mindfulness, going back and fetching that wisdom and bringing it to that point of contact. And then not wanting to go to the bar is that Sampajañña, it's that clear comprehension where Oh no, I actually don't want to because I remember that hangover. That's how mindfulness, wisdom, and self-pajñña work together to create what the Buddha Dassa calls quenching at the point of contact, where instead of desire arising or aversion arising, it's just a coolness that doesn't allow desire or aversion to arise. It just allows you to have freedom. Essentially, that's what that coolness is. It's the freedom to be okay with or without whatever is pulling at you, essentially. But that's how mindfulness functions, to make you more free, essentially.

**Speaker C:** Okay, thanks. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I think I understand a bit better.

**Speaker F:** Do you think that free alcoholics Like Alan Watts, for example. Uh, he was a known alcoholic.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker F:** And, but there's like other people too. Yeah. It's a funny, it's a funny topic. What do you think?

**Speaker A:** It's an important question and I've thought about this for probably 12 years at least. Um, and I've had different perspectives on it. On the one— here's one perspective. Alan Watts had extremely strong wisdom, right? And but he didn't have very much restraint, I guess you can say. So I guess you can say he's a good example of why the Noble Eightfold Path has to be complete to lead to full liberation. Because if Alan Watts was completely cool and satisfied, he wouldn't need to be drunk, right? Though he had developed a perspective that everything's okay, but that the universe is sort of like just a play, whatever. But yeah, I mean, it's sort of like it's sort of a place you can get stuck in the middle of the path in a way, I think, like if you don't have the sense restraint to accompany the wisdom. So yeah, I just, I don't know, it's hard to talk about that.

**Speaker D:** Were you trying to say something? Can I say something or no?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, go ahead.

**Speaker D:** We awaken where we are, and I don't know anything about Alan Watts' personal predilections, But I do know, I mean, listen to a lot of his speeches, and what I don't know, but he did, he had a beautiful voice, he was a beautiful speaker, and he enjoyed his talks because they went on for hours.

**Speaker A:** Entertainer. Yeah, there is such a thing.

**Speaker D:** Sorry, go ahead.

**Speaker A:** No, no, go ahead and finish.

**Speaker D:** Not what I did find, and I just kind of hesitant to mention this, but the interviews that I read with some of his family members were at least a more— they were more helpful, helpful to me on the path.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So yeah, I mean, if there, there's such a thing that the Buddha called a negligent Sotapanna. So a Srotapanna has already seen the Dhamma, right? You know, but they haven't uprooted craving and ill will and the higher five fetters. And there was actually one example in the suttas in the Pali canon of a Srotapanna who was like an alcoholic. He was drunk all the time. And the other monks were like talking to the Buddha like, you know, what's up with this guy? Are you sure he's actually a Srotapanna? The Buddha was like, no, yeah, he is a Srotapanna. He's just negligent, you know. And it was sort of like a cautionary tale of, you know, dropping the practice too early. You know, it's sort of like you're in the raft and you're halfway across the flood and you're like, maybe you just kind of lay down in the boat instead of getting to the shore. But or maybe you just get off the boat and sink. I'm not sure. But yeah, I mean, the best way I like to respond to the Ananda Watts question is like he's a good example of the path factors not being in balance. Too much wisdom, not enough virtue. Not, you know, not enough— maybe not enough Samadhi either, because Samadhi really comes when the wisdom and the virtue come together. They culminate in Samadhi. And a mind that has all of the Noble Eightfold Path working in balance is not going to move towards something as gross— G-R-O-S-S— as alcohol, for sure. You know.

**Speaker D:** It'Ll figure it out.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, maybe he lived longer, he would have stopped being an alcoholic. Who knows? Perhaps.

**Speaker A:** I mean, Nisargadatta said that he continued smoking because the body was addicted to it. Well, he used his own language for that, but these types of spec— these types of questions used to occupy a lot of my time.

**Speaker H:** But I think he quit towards the end.

**Speaker A:** Though. Did he?

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Oh, interesting.

**Speaker F:** I didn't know that.

**Speaker H:** I found that out a couple years ago.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, he said the spirit of the tobacco was in his body or something like that. But, you know, the body can be addicted and the mind can be free.

**Speaker F:** I know it is negligence, but I think that's not the only thing. And as a community, we should talk about this more because communities can definitely help people get out of that negligence. So it's like a behavioral issue and a communal issue and a negligence, maybe some other things too.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I mean, like, this idea that someone can't have seen the Dharma and consume alcohol or break the precepts, that's definitely not supported in the suttas, because, you know, it's only the lower three fetters that are broken at stream entry, which is a belief in, you know, something permanent in the five aggregates, the self and the five aggregates. You know, attachment to rights, rules, and rituals as a means of liberation. And then doubt about what to do or what not to do, what is the path, what is not the path. Um, but, you know, craving and ill will are the next two fetters. And as long as craving is present, you know, in the experience, which it is up in— if we're looking at, if we're looking at that traditional model, um, as long as craving is present, um, then even with all of that wisdom, you know, anything is possible. So I don't think it's necessary to sort of judge, but I don't think it's useful for somebody who's like early.

**Speaker D:** If you're judging an outside practice, you're already in a trap. You're already solidifying, you're already objectifying, you're already doing what we avoid at the outset of the conversation.

**Speaker A:** Speculative, and also, right, we can use it to be like, well, Alan Watts drank, so I can, you know, I can still make progress in the practice. Um, and, you know, I mean, you don't want to get super caught in, caught in that trap of judgment, essentially. But it's not conducive, I would say. That's my best answer I could say.

**Speaker H:** Yeah, it reminds me of, like, if somebody— I feel like there's different levels to the— just to respond to the Alan Watts question, it's like if somebody— I say like the first level would be like your ordinary people And if they come, let's say, across like a pile of candy, the typical people in this example would just like jump all over the candy like dogs, you know, like hungry ghosts.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker H:** And then like a second level up would be somebody who comes who's like very spiritual, very disciplined, and and they want the candy, but they don't take it. And they can sit there their entire life and not take the candy, but inside they really want that candy. And then there's another higher level up still, which is somebody who comes across the candy and looks at it more like something that they may need at particular times. And then they might take a little bit of candy, but— and they're like a very, very disciplined person, but they don't allow themselves to enjoy the candy while they take it. They might just need it for sustenance, you know. But I think, in my opinion, it doesn't matter about the quantity of what you're taking. What matters more is your relationship to it. So to me, the highest level would be somebody who comes across the candy and just seize the Dhamma. And what is the Dhamma in this instance? It would be, oh, it's just food. It's not gold like the hungry ghost thinks it is. It's not another spiritual step on the ladder, you know, to gain more spiritual materialism or spiritual status. It's just food. So if he's hungry, he'll eat it and he'll even enjoy it, or he might not touch it if he doesn't feel like it, depending. So I feel like that's the highest level. It's not a matter of should we or shouldn't we. It's more like a personal choice and where you are seeing reality as it is. And it kind of reminds me of Buddha Dasa Bhikkhu. And they made a big fuss because he was eating meat. And they had this big get-together of people, you know, of, uh, other monks and stuff. And he was just like, I'm just eating food, you know, I don't know what the big deal is. And that reminded me, I'm like, wow, that's, that's, that's the highest level. It's like he saw reality as it was. He didn't see it as a religious thing. He didn't see it as gold. He didn't see it as shit. He saw it as food, as what it was. And that's the Dharma here and now, you know.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And beautifully stated. Thank you. I was thinking while you're saying that, um, when, um, when I was 15, that was my first vision of the Dhamma, and that was before I knew anything about Buddhism. And the way I saw everything was as sunlight. I just saw everything as sunlight.

**Speaker D:** Um.

**Speaker A:** You know, no matter what it was. And, uh, I don't know, made me think of that, kind of reminded me of that perception.

**Speaker H:** Nice.

**Speaker A:** So I'm wondering if there's any more questions from some of our newcomers here. It's always helpful to ground the conversation in practice-based questions, or even not just the newcomers.

**Speaker D:** As we practice and as we age in the practice, we will find out, and many of you will, I promise, discover that the reality of what we navigate with the Dharma, with our lives, and then when we actually, when these things unfold, they're much more nuanced than the maps. And things are the Citta, the mind, it's actually simple. But what we will have to navigate It's not always going to be theoretical. It's not always going to tell like a nice story.

**Speaker C:** How much time would you recommend doing a practice like meditation, spend doing that compared to studying? Like spiritual teachings? Would it be like 50/50, or what was your— what's your opinion on that?

**Speaker D:** Is the question for me or Michael?

**Speaker C:** Either. If anyone has an opinion on that.

**Speaker A:** I feel that that question is a bit related to what Brett just said. Because it really is personal. You know, everything comes back to whatever quenches dukkha, whatever brings dukkha to cessation, whatever brings about the most insight into reality as it is. So my practice has taken different forms in different times. When I lived in Thailand, I was meditating 6 hours a day. I'd sit for 2 hours watching the breath, getting into very, very, very pleasant abidings. And doing those 2-hour sittings 3 times a day, connecting those states to one another, it was almost impossible to speak. There was no sense of craving in the body. There was no sense of self and experience. And this went on for a very, very long time. And When I started to participate in the world a little bit more than that, with working and things like that, and started to read more teachings and things like that, that continuity of that pleasant abiding started to become less so. And defilements were still there, hindrances were still there. And nowadays I almost never do formal sittings, I would say. And instead what I do is continuously remind myself that everything is okay. And this allows for a much, I would say, more workable version of that sense of pleasant abiding in all aspects of my life. As you know, I teach high school, I have two other jobs, I have two kids, I'm married, I have a house. The remembering of the Dhamma works much better for living an active life than having to sort of create those states and hold on to them. I described this once before in a talk actually with Dhamma Dasa, that long sitting practices where you cultivate strong, pleasant meditative states, it's like getting drunk, you know, like in a way, because when you go and get a beer, if you like to drink, You feel very content, not when you're drunk, just when you have the beer in your hand, because everything that you've been craving and wanting is right there in your hand. You're not thinking about the past, you're not thinking about the future, you're not thinking about— you're just enjoying your beer. So there's no craving in that moment, right? It's sort of temporarily ceased because the object of craving is in your hand. And as you drink and you get a buzz and it starts to feel good, All of a sudden now you have something that you have to maintain. And so then you have to drink more to maintain the buzz. But inevitably there's a point where it can't be maintained. It starts to go negative. It starts to come down. It starts to turn into sickness. Perhaps it makes your behavior go in the wrong direction. And so that's a funny comparison to cultivating long sittings. But when you cultivate long sittings and you cultivate like Jhana states and you try to maintain them throughout the day, you're sort of giving yourself a burden to carry in a way. You're like trying to maintain it. Whereas when you take Dhammarato's advice, which is to do 6 10-minute sittings a day where you just kind of stop and remember that everything's okay, and then you remind yourself of that, whenever you remind yourself to have wholesome thoughts, you're not really giving yourself a whole lot to manage and maintain. You're sort of bringing the mind closer to reality more continuously in a less dramatic way, I guess I would say. And how much listening to Dhamma, how much reading of the suttas or whatever you want to read, that you need to help you remember that, to do that. That's sort of like, it just depends on you really. I can't really tell you how much you would need to do, but you do whatever you need to do to keep the mind remembering to come back to the present moment and keep the mind remembering that everything is okay, that, you know, all problems are make-believe essentially. So that's not really a specific answer, but that's kind of the best answer I can give. From experience. So I mean, invite anybody else to kind of share their advice on that question because it's a really good one.

**Speaker C:** Okay, thanks. Yeah, because I'm usually feeling— I feel pretty good most of the time. I feel satisfied. I've found sort of like you, while working, then it's hard to remember because you contemplate— or you're not contemplating, but like conceptualizing so many things that it sort of takes you into a dream while you're working. So it's kind of hard to keep remembering and to stay mindful during that time. That's something I'm trying to figure out, is how to create that satisfaction. Like when I'm driving my car to work, I feel great. Like I can just like drive and relax. But when I'm working, it's like 10, like 100 times harder. So yeah, that's something I'm trying to figure out.

**Speaker H:** Whatever your first priority is, you become, as Robert Adams said. So when you're on your way to work, you're probably in your best Dhamma kind of state, you know. And when you get to work, you're in your kind of boss's mental state of hurry up and get stuff done, you know. And that becomes your first priority. That's why not working is ideal, but a lot of people have to. So yeah, just do the best you can, I guess.

**Speaker F:** I don't know.

**Speaker C:** And then also having a priority in your mind is also something you're conceptualizing as well. So that can be sort of hinder your satisfaction as well.

**Speaker H:** Well, if it's a priority that's not causing dukkha, that's the priority you want to lean towards.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that's right. Okay, I appreciate your advice. I'll think about that.

**Speaker H:** No problem, bro.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, don't have to take the work seriously. Can have fun at work instead.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, like it's like sketching with a pencil. You don't have to bear down to do your sketch. Your moments of mindfulness can occur with a light touch, with like a eventually with a feather touch, or as soon as possible, or with as little effort as necessary to penetrate reality, and no more.

**Speaker I:** I think this is why Dhammarato's advice is so helpful to me. I think in the past I struggled so much with the idea of meditation as a to-do list, but Dhammarato has this very light way of seeing things. You know, just sit down 6 times a day, like, take it really easy. Eventually I find that in daily life, you know, like you said, Brad, all I need is just a light touch because the formal sitting, which is 6 times a day, really short brief of time, the mindfulness sustains itself and all you need is just a light touch. Like 'Hey, remember to wake up.' And it's just wholesomeness upon wholesomeness, right? Like, you really remember. It's just wholesome rather than feeling down about, 'Oh no, oh no, I'm not mindful.' It's really a beautiful practice, and I'm just reflecting on it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, also just remember, Dream Destroyer, that we can't be without concepts while we're practicing. You know, the Buddha said to think of the Dhamma as a raft. You know, it's something that you have to put together and use to cross the other shore, but If you're afraid to kind of construct anything at all, then you end up in a conundrum.

**Speaker C:** But.

**Speaker A:** What I really wanted to comment on is what Dhamma Dasa said about— is it Richard Adams you said said that? But whatever is your highest value is what you become, or your highest priority is what you become. And what I noticed from going back and doing a deep dive into all of Dhammarato's discussions with students is he just has a religious devotion to being satisfied. Nothing shakes him on that point. And the way I take the word satisfaction is to be desireless, you know. And I've known for a long time, I've known for a long time that desirelessness is true happiness. But the mistake I was making was that I was trying to be desireless I was practicing towards desirelessness. I was meditating to become desireless. I was asking questions and cultivating insights and deepening my understanding and reading suttas and all kinds of stuff to become desireless. And, um, but you can actually just choose to be desireless. It's a lot easier. You can just let go of desire. That's That's a big insight.

**Speaker H:** I heard Ajahn Samatha say that it's not desires that are the problem, it's the negative attachments to the desires. I was like, yeah, that's awesome, man.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I mean.

**Speaker C:** Oh, I did try a satisfaction meditation and I found that If I desire the present moment to be exactly as it is, then your desire is fulfilled. So it's sort of like a positive feedback loop. Yes, which is kind of strange.

**Speaker A:** I did that once. Yeah, I want this breath right now. I want to be sitting in this chair in this garage right now. I want to be talking to you guys on Discord right now. Like, whatever was happening, I would say that would be my Mantra. Like, I, I want that I would use wanting like a backburner that they use to extinguish a fire. Like the two wants come together in the moment and extinguish each other. Yeah, that's a fun practice.

**Speaker C:** I appreciate your advice. I'll see how this next week goes, and I'll let you guys know if my week's gone any differently.

**Speaker H:** Yeah, and the mind's gonna wander, you know, it's gonna happen. And like, something I often used to overlook that Dhammarato would say, but I tried to go back to as much as possible, kind of like a mantra, is when he was saying— I think it's a Goenka quote— but he was saying, when the mind wanders, you know, just never mind, start again. Come back to the breath, come back to the doorway of right here, right now is good enough, everything's fine. And I just love that never mind, start again, and saying it in a very nurturing way. Um, it is very helpful to me. I don't know if it will help.

**Speaker C:** You, but okay, thanks. Well, I gotta get going to bed soon. I get up at like, like 4:30, 5 o'clock. And it's like 9:30 now. So yeah, thanks for having me here.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, thank you for joining us.

**Speaker F:** Have a great night. Do you guys put stickers? I know I used to put up like reminders all over my wall and have like alarms on my phone. For like certain meditation stuff. It was helpful. I don't do it much anymore, but I'm thinking about bringing it back. What's your experience?

**Speaker A:** It could be whatever is helpful.

**Speaker D:** The need to set timers, mark the calendar, and organize the practice. That comes and goes. So I think I would say in the experience, in the practice here, it's come and gone time to time. But it does seem to be an experience that was more endemic to the past here too.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, I find that structure healthy.

**Speaker E:** Look at the calendar. Today is another holiday. Let's celebrate.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker F:** But when I get a little too loose with structure in my life and I do whatever I want whenever, I notice more craving and clinging and sensory desire. So like, it's nice to know, hey, there's a Discord call at whatever, 11 PM for me. Uh, it's like there's clock time, human-made clock time, and then there's like universal time, timeless time, like the time of the oceans and the cosmos. And I like to balance, organize what I can.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I'm glad you brought up the thing about, you know, oh yeah, there's a Discord call today or a Sangha call today that I can join. You know, I mean, Sangha is the great reminder. Yes, and it's one of the easiest ways to tell if you are bullshitting yourself or not. Just go hang out in Sangha.

**Speaker H:** Very true. You definitely don't want to do whatever you feel like doing as far as like alcohol, drugs, smoking, not taking care of responsibilities. I would definitely recommend no alcohol, no drugs, and yeah.

**Speaker I:** Structure is so interesting because the Buddha did say something about be responsible for your own action, something like that. So think of structure in a wholesome way rather than something restrictive, something that is helping you. Like, we have to have a good relationship. Something I think of, like, is the.

**Speaker A:** You know.

**Speaker I:** With ourselves, right? Like inner child, whatever you can call it. The more we carry, like, structure rather than seeing as an obstacle is a way to practice. Because like Mikey said, like today is not a holiday, so shouldn't this also be another good way to practice? And tying back to what Dhamma Das said, your priority is what you become. So if the becoming is to be satisfied, then structuring in a way that doesn't lead away from towards the lower level of satisfaction, right? There's a kind of satisfaction that's very lower realm and doesn't last long, and we all know what that is, like hedonistic lifestyle is something that comes to mind. So yeah, structure in a way that's helpful to you, that's fun, that's not restrictive.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I think sometimes it comes down to how you understand the word satisfaction as well. And for me, satisfaction, like I said, means to be not wanting, like without desire. And usually our satisfaction comes after we've acquired something. And if you pay really close attention to that process, you realize that the pleasure that you get from any activity or object is actually the pleasure of desire coming to cessation. Because right as you reach that thing you wanted, the desire for it ceases, and that's the pleasure you get. But then we misattribute that pleasure to getting the object. But because of that ignorance, the mind creates new desires because it starts to think, okay, happiness, you know, is— or pleasure is in acquiring objects. But true pleasure, true satisfaction, is just in the non-arising of desire or fear. It's a sense of freedom. In that non-arising. And that's the Third Noble Truth. The duty to the Third Noble Truth is realizing that, noticing that, right? The First Noble Truth is to understand Dukkha, to understand what dissatisfaction really is, that we're caught in this cycle of wanting things that we don't have, not wanting things to be the way they are, being in a state of doubt and confusion. The Second Noble Truth being You know, uh, well, actually, I kind of just described the Second Noble Truth, come to think of it. Um, but the Third Noble Truth being, uh, yeah, the Third Noble Truth being the cessation of desire. But the Buddha says that, you know, you have to fully understand Dukkha. You have to abandon wanting things you don't have, that craving. And you have to realize the cessation of Dukkha, meaning that you have to actually notice when when the absence of craving is what happiness really is. So you have to train the mind to notice that and to settle there. That's what satisfaction is. You have to train the mind to be happy being satisfied. You know, you don't just get that. You don't just cultivate satisfaction and then, oh great, that was great satisfaction. What's next? Because then you've just gone from satisfaction to dissatisfaction. You have to then return back to being satisfied. Keep returning back to being satisfied. That's the core mindfulness. That's the core Sati, right? Returning to being satisfied and knowing that fleeting pleasures ultimately lead to just more cycles of dissatisfaction. I thought I saw Brett raise his hand.

**Speaker D:** I wanted to wait for you to answer the question fully, but Okay, here comes the question then. What— how rapidly— have you ever broken a bone, Michael? Like just by accident, or stubbed a toe and broken it?

**Speaker A:** Yes, a couple times.

**Speaker D:** Quickly, did you return from back to satisfaction after the broken bone?

**Speaker A:** Um, like emotionally, or, or do you mean like how quickly did the bone heal?

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Let me see if I can remember. I don't know. Quickly.

**Speaker D:** How quickly does the Dharma fall away? Because I think with— Quite quickly.

**Speaker A:** I don't know.

**Speaker D:** I thought that was the most recent time. One can experience a broken toe and then the next mind moment the drama disappears and one deals with the aftermath. The first noble truth is still there.

**Speaker A:** That's true. Yeah.

**Speaker D:** So we can't relate ever to the first truth by denial. That's Moha.

**Speaker A:** Delusion. I see what you mean.

**Speaker F:** Do you guys still experience craving or clinging?

**Speaker A:** Yes, of course.

**Speaker F:** So, yes, I guess the point of the path is to eliminate it, right? If there is a point, we could say it is a goalless goal, some sort of aim.

**Speaker H:** Only if it causes Dukkha.

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** It would be interesting. Go ahead. That's, you know, what it says in the suttas, that Nibbana is like the final end. All the taints are destroyed and the fetters are all broken. The defilements are brought to extinguishment and all that stuff. And you have all kinds of different views on that, right? You have like the monastic community in the Theravada tradition that believes that it's going to take us thousands of lifetimes to acquire that. And then you have someone like Dhammarato who says like, fuck that, sometimes you feel like Anicca, sometimes you don't, you know, like don't ever think of a final ending to the arising of these things, like everything's impermanent, you know, keep practicing, keep returning to satisfaction, and don't worry about when it's never going to arise again. But he's just a good teacher because I know he knows that if you keep returning to satisfaction, that satisfaction gets deeper and deeper and deeper, and it gets to a point where when craving and clinging do arise, they arise like almost like tiny whispers in the mind, whereas before they might have been your entire universe, you know, like it would have become your entire world. I mean, just stubbing your toe, like Brett said, some people— I know them— stub their toe and that becomes their entire universe for a time, just screaming and shouting in anger and throwing the furniture, just complete— everything just becomes that, that experience. And then, you know, then the stories and the narratives that follow, and that might seem ridiculous to us, but like our own triggers, our own experiences that lead to that level of birth. Um, those type, you know, even the biggest things that we used to obsess over, our obsessions, let's say our passions and our obsessions, when you keep remembering to be satisfied, remembering to like let go of desire is the way I interpret that. Um, the things that used to enter the mind and create obsession becomes so ineffective at stirring you up. Doesn't mean you're free of desire, doesn't mean you're free of clinging. It just means that your awareness and your wisdom have grown so strong, and the practice has grown so continuous, that if you do get sort of swept up, it might just be for a mind moment, and then you come right back. So it's not really useful to have the goal of being free of desire because then you get stuck in judging yourself. You know, every time you have a desire, then you add Dukkha to it. It's like there's the first arrow, then you have the second, then you have the third. So the way that Dhammarato teaches really gets us out of that habit of adding more suffering to suffering. My voice is getting dry. Sorry. So that's what I would say to that.

**Speaker H:** And it reminds me of— I always think for a lot of the Westerners, the good Christ metaphors or quotes are always good too. Like when Jesus would meet a horrible sinner, tax collector, whatever, he would always say that phrase we all know. It's like, okay, you're forgiven, now go forth and sin no more. And a lot of times in the passages, the person who was forgiven by Christ couldn't believe their ears. Like, why am I forgiven? I don't deserve this. Like, surely you're mistaken. He's like, dude, you're forgiven. Just don't do it again, you know? And I think that's a good attitude to, to have when we mess up. It doesn't give us an excuse to keep messing up, but it does remind us, like, hey man, it's okay. Just go forth and sin no more. Like, go forth, try your best, you know?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, it's sort of like asking, you know, we were talking about alcohol earlier, and some alcoholics will drink for a long time and drink every day, and then at some point they will be able to put the bottle down. Then Maybe 5 years later, something happens and they pick the bottle back up again. So, you know, it's not even really all that worthwhile to ask, you know, am I going to experience stress again? Am I going to experience craving again? Am I going to experience Dukkha again? But what we can practice is putting that bottle down, Putting the stress down, throwing it out, throwing the Dukkha and the dissatisfaction out right now. That is something that we can know that we're doing right now. When we throw the stress out, there's relief from stress, Sukkha, Nirodha. This is.

**Speaker D:** Nice.

**Speaker I:** Something I still catch myself doing is thinking about future Dukkha, as if that's going to help, but it's still Dukkha.

**Speaker E:** I've never seen or experienced future Dukkha.

**Speaker H:** I love future Dukkha. It's my best friend.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, when there's future Dukkha, I don't.

**Speaker E:** Have to worry about Dukkha right now.

**Speaker H:** Yeah, I'm free from it now, so that's great.

**Speaker D:** It's never going to get here.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, the central theme is the practice of **"doing nothing"** or **"not bothering"** as a direct path to liberation, inspired by a Winnie-the-Pooh story and framed through the teachings of Dhammarato and Ajahn Buddhadasa.

Here is a summary of the key points discussed:

### Core Teaching: The Path of "Doing Nothing"
The group uses a Winnie-the-Pooh story where Christopher Robin describes doing "nothing" as "just going along, listening to all the things you can't hear, and not bothering." This is presented as a perfect metaphor for the essence of the Dhamma.

1.  **From Materialism to Spiritual Materialism:** We begin life in "worldly materialism," seeking happiness in future goals (a house, a job, etc.). When we encounter spiritual teachings, we often turn them into new goals (Jhāna, stream-entry, Nibbāna). This is "spiritual materialism"—seeking non-material objects with the same craving mindset.
2.  **"Not Bothering" = Letting Things Be:** The true practice is to stop this seeking. It is to **let things be exactly as they are** without "cooking them up" (adding craving, aversion, or delusion). As Ajahn Chah said: "The sound doesn't bother you, you bother the sound." This non-interference is the heart of the path.
3.  **Satisfaction is the Goal:** The end of the path isn't a special state or achievement, but **being satisfied with things as they are, right here and now**. True happiness is "causeless"—it's the joy of desire itself ceasing, not the joy of getting what you desired.
4.  **The Practice:** It involves a continuous, gentle remembering to return to satisfaction. This isn't a passive "doing nothing," but an active **undoing** of habitual patterns of craving and self-identification. It's choosing not to solidify the ever-changing flow of nature (the five aggregates) into problems or objects of desire.

### Key Insights and Clarifications from the Discussion:
*   **It's Not Passivity:** The practice involves wise choice and using mindfulness to remember the Dhamma ("everything is already okay") especially when hindrances arise. It's about changing your *relationship* to experience, not becoming inert.
*   **Emptiness (Suññatā):** This is linked to "doing nothing" as **radical presence**—allowing the mind to drop what is not here (past memories, future worries, irrelevant narratives). When irrelevant perceptions are absent, the suffering dependent on them is also absent.
*   **Role of Mindfulness (Sati):** Mindfulness is memory. Initially, it's remembering to pay attention to body, feelings, mind, and thoughts. At a deeper level, it's **remembering the Dhamma itself**—recalling that everything is okay and fetching that wisdom at the moment of contact with experience.
*   **States vs. Freedom:** Meditative states (Jhāna, pīti, sukha) are conditioned and impermanent. They are not the goal. The goal is the **deathless (Nibbāna)**—the mind's freedom that doesn't arise or cease, characterized by non-greed, non-hatred, and non-delusion. It's the "coolness" of not clinging, regardless of what states come and go.
*   **Practical Advice:** Structure practice lightly. Dhammarato's advice of six short (e.g., 10-minute) sittings per day is highlighted as sustainable for household life. The key is frequent, gentle reminders to be satisfied rather than long sessions aimed at achieving and maintaining special states.
*   **Community (Sangha):** The Sangha acts as a vital mirror and support system, helping practitioners see when they might be deceiving themselves or becoming negligent.

### Conclusion:
The talk emphasizes a profound shift from goal-oriented striving to a gentle, persistent **"undoing"**—releasing the habit of creating problems out of the flow of life. The path is framed as a continuous homecoming to satisfaction and peace with the present moment, perfectly encapsulated in the childlike wisdom of "just going along, listening to all the things you can't hear, and not bothering."

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, the primary **metaphor and story** used are:

### 1. The Core Story & Metaphor: "Doing Nothing" from Winnie-the-Pooh
*   **The Story:** The speaker begins by recounting a dialogue between **Pooh and Christopher Robin**. Christopher Robin says his favorite thing is "doing nothing," which he describes as "just going along, listening to all the things you can't hear, and not bothering."
*   **The Metaphor:** This story is used as a direct metaphor for the **Dharma practice** taught by Dhammarato and the essence of the Buddhist path.
    *   **"Doing nothing"** is equated with **non-doing, non-grasping, and not bothering** experience. It represents the cessation of craving and clinging (*tanha* and *upadana*).
    *   **"Listening to all the things you can't hear"** symbolizes a deep, receptive awareness of the present moment, the "activity of nature," or the unconditioned reality beyond our conceptual stories.

### 2. Extended Metaphors and Analogies Used to Explain the Dharma:
Throughout the discussion, speakers use several other powerful metaphors to illustrate the teachings:

*   **Spiritual Materialism:** The worldly habit of seeking happiness in future goals (a house, a degree) is transferred to spiritual goals (Jhana, Nibbana, Arhatship), turning them into objects of craving. This is likened to switching from **"material pursuit" to "spiritual material pursuit."**
*   **Cooking vs. Not Cooking:** Referencing Ajahn Buddhadasa, the mind's habit of taking raw experience and "cooking it up" into stories of good/bad, mine/yours is contrasted with simply **"leaving it as it is."**
*   **The Sound Doesn't Bother You:** Referencing Ajahn Chah, the problem is not experience itself, but our reaction to it. **"You bother the sound."** "Not bothering" is another way to say "not craving and clinging."
*   **The Path of Nothing:** The path is described as **"a path made up of nothing, leading nowhere."** The goal is not an acquisition but a letting go and being satisfied with things as they are.
*   **The Kamma Machine in the Sky:** A humorous metaphor (attributed to Dhammarato) for a superstitious, magical view of karma, contrasted with a practical understanding of karma as choice and cause/effect.
*   **Talking Ourselves Into Feeling Bad:** Our negative mental habits are described as a lifetime of **"talking ourselves into feeling bad,"** convincing ourselves of narratives and problems. The practice is introducing a "counter-narrative" of "everything is okay."
*   **The Raft:** A classic Buddhist metaphor (referenced directly) for the Dharma itself—a tool to be used to cross the flood of suffering and then let go of, not clung to as an end in itself.
*   **The Thief:** Referencing Buddhadasa, we are like **thieves** who take the processes of nature (the five *khandhas*) and claim them as "me" or "mine." Liberation is "giving it all back" to nature.
*   **The Two Arrows:** The idea that pain (the first arrow) is inevitable, but our suffering in response to it (the second, third arrows) is optional and created by our craving and stories.
*   **Sunlight:** One speaker shares a personal vision of seeing everything as **sunlight**, a metaphor for perceiving the fundamental, undivided nature of reality.
*   **Candy and Food:** Used in a multi-level analogy about relationship to desire. The highest level is seeing candy (or any object) not as gold (craving) or a spiritual test (aversion), but simply as **"food"**—seeing reality as it is, free from added valuation.

### 3. Metaphors for Stages and Missteps:
*   **Getting Drunk on Meditation:** Long, intense meditation that produces blissful states is compared to **getting drunk**. The state is pleasant but must be maintained, becomes a burden, and eventually fades, potentially leading to negative consequences if clung to.
*   **Splashing Happiness Around:** The initial excitement of discovering causeless joy can lead to wanting to **"splash it all over people,"** which can be off-putting. Maturity is being a calm, open space without needing to display it.
*   **The Negligent Sotapanna:** Like a person who gets into a raft to cross a river but **lies down halfway** instead of reaching the other shore, or gets out and sinks. This illustrates the danger of having insight (stream entry) but neglecting continued practice.
*   **Buttons and Triggers:** Our conditioned emotional reactions are like having **"buttons"** that can be pushed. With mindfulness and wisdom, these buttons are seen for what they are and eventually disappear.

**In summary,** the talk uses the gentle, **"doing nothing" metaphor from Winnie-the-Pooh** as a central, accessible frame. This is then unpacked and elaborated through a rich tapestry of **Buddhist-inspired metaphors** (cooking, thieves, rafts, arrows) and **modern, relatable analogies** (spiritual materialism, talking ourselves into trouble, splashing happiness, buttons) to demystify the core Dharma message: letting things be as they are, putting down craving, and finding satisfaction in the present.
