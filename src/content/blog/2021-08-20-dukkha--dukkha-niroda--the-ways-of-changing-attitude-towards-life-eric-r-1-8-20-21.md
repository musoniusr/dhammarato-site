### Transcript


**Speaker A:** the difference between Tanisero's book and Goenka.

**Speaker B:** Sure. I found some similarities though. In the stages of the meditation in Tanisero's book, I think first is finding a comfortable breath, then staying with the breath, then it's focusing on a point, right? Is that the third step?

**Speaker A:** No, not at all. This focusing on one-pointedness actually is a much later practice that is actually more of a toy to play with. Yes. That in fact there is no place in the— and there's no place in the suttas where the nose tip or the nose is in fact ever mentioned.

**Speaker B:** But it's in the book though.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, it's in the book. It's in a lot of books.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so you don't agree, uh, you don't practice, uh, personally as it's stated in that book?

**Speaker A:** In Ajahn Thanissaro's book? I don't know, I haven't read it.

**Speaker B:** Oh, do you mind if I go get it? I think it's nearby here.

**Speaker A:** No, you don't need to do that. No, we got better things to do than read books.

**Speaker B:** Well, yeah, that leads me to an important question, which is how do you practice? Like, do you have steps too, or is it just like fully with the breath and guiding it towards parts of the body and relaxing even every time?

**Speaker A:** All right, let's restate. That question into the question of what practice did the Buddha teach? What was the way that the Buddha taught Anapanasati? That would be a better question. Or exactly another question related to that was How did the various teachings of the Buddha fit in with Anapanasati, so that we can come up with a way of practice that's actually practicing the Eightfold Noble Path? Another way of thinking of it is that Anapanasati is the application of the Eightfold Noble Path. Most specifically right view, right Sati, right effort, and right sankhapa, or attitude. Okay, so Anapanasati is to be practiced through the Eightfold Noble Path, and one of the key ingredients is right effort. But in fact, that's the key that most people miss. There's also a lot of translation errors that cause people to miss. But one of the really main issues is that they misunderstand right effort. And so I will describe to you an easy way to understand right effort, and that is to do the least amount of work possible to actually get the job done. That's right effort, to do the least amount of work possible to actually get the job done. Yeah, and that most people work either too much or too little And if they're working too little, they can call it choiceless awareness.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And if they're working too hard, then they can call it deep meditation. And that these are the two extremes that are mostly practiced in Western culture, that in fact, this is the whole way that it's practiced in the Western culture, comes out of a practice that was developed for the military government of Burma back in the 1950s. And that's the 10-day meditation retreat that Goenka got into, made very famous. Then the Mahasis started to follow that method too, and pretty soon that whole idea of a 10-day retreat, with variations on the number of days, came into being in the West as almost an appendage of Buddhism. And yet it was only invented in the 1950s.

**Speaker B:** They think that it was older though, right?

**Speaker A:** Well, maybe some features of it, but we're talking about the actual thing that Western people see when they think of meditation and meditation halls and all of that. But in the suttas, the Buddha says go to the forest or to the foot of a tree. Or to an empty hut. He didn't say to go to a meditation hall with 50 or 60 or 100 or 500 other people, but go to an empty forest instead to go into real seclusion. So that's one of the differences right there. Another difference is, is that normally the Dharma is taught one-on-one like we're having this conversation now, and it was never— it was, um, let us say there have been public talks for forever. The Buddha also spoke publicly, but much of the actual work is done in private. And if one goes retreats and all one ever has is a contact with the teachers when the teacher's up on the stage, up on the dais or platform or whatever you want to call it, and you don't have an actual personal relationship with the teacher, then that's what you wind up with— Western Buddhism. Especially if the teacher is expensive.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so this is the, uh, the part that has Western Buddhism more Western than Buddhism. Because in fact, the 10-day retreats are often set up like a first-grade classroom. Yeah, but a PhD research project is not set up in rows of chairs. And neither are Watts. And in fact, I've never seen monks sit in a row. When, uh, whenever they're sitting, uh, around in, in one of the boards, or most of them are sitting against the wall, leaving space in the middle for things to happen. Okay, so There's a lot of Westernism built into what you see in the actual teachings of the Buddha. But you can also say that, yes, there is some Buddhism in there someplace. All right. But only some, that some of the major ingredients have been missing. One of the examples of it is right effort. Yes, is that you have to put some skin in the game. In fact, the joke is, it said, how much skin do you have to put in the game? All of it. The whole body. The whole body has to get into the practice. You have to wake up the whole body. You have to take control of the body. You have to start noticing what the hands are doing. You have to notice what expressions you have on your face. You have to notice your posture, because you can notice your posture. You have to know when you're smiling and when you're not smiling. You have to start paying attention to what's happening.

**Speaker B:** So you try to maintain a full body awareness at all times?

**Speaker A:** No, not all the time. All the time is a Western concept.

**Speaker B:** Right now?

**Speaker A:** Just right now, right? Whenever you remember to, when Sati is there and the skill of watching what's going on is developing. To start paying attention to what's happening with the body. Start paying— in fact, a way of looking at it is, is that within the teachings of the Buddha, there are six senses: eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and the mind. And that most of us Westerners spend almost all of our time in the mind and the input to the mind is its own memory systems. And we spend very little time in real senses, and the real senses is what contacts and has input from reality of this present moment. So a lot of the teaching of the Buddha has to do with 'be here now,' which means be in our senses and pay attention to what's happening with the senses right here, right now, rather than making up stories about right here, right now. With the mind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's a bit tricky for me.

**Speaker A:** It's tricky for everybody. It's not just tricky, it's a bad habit.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but a specific example is in the book I mentioned to you by Arahant Anicca. He mentions ardency, and I relate that very much to the right effort, but he puts it as a part of the three elements of concentration: ardency, alertness, and mindfulness. And he defines—

**Speaker A:** you're using the word artistry?

**Speaker B:** No, ardency, like ardent, A-R-D-E-N-C-Y.

**Speaker A:** All right, let's change that from the connotation that that word puts into it and use eager or enthusiastic instead. Yeah, enthusiasm. And what are the other two?

**Speaker B:** Alertness and mindfulness.

**Speaker A:** What's the difference between alertness and mindfulness?

**Speaker B:** As he defines those terms in the book, alertness is the body awareness. Like what you said, knowing what's happening in the body in the present moment. What sensations are you feeling? What's happening? And mindfulness is the ability to stay with that intention.

**Speaker A:** All right, so basically what he's actually talking about then, in the language that you've given here, so the way that you're talking about it, is right view and right Sati. Which are actual factors on the path. And Right View and Right Sati— Sati means to wake up, and Right View is to see what's going on. For instance, the example would be to wake up and smell the coffee. All right, so this is perhaps what you're talking about, Right View. And right Sati. And then the ardency would be the right attitude, which would be Samma Sanghappa. And so where's the fourth item, which is one's right effort? Because right effort and right Sati and right view run in circle around each other. And then when you get those going as a skill, you develop also Samma Sanghappa, which is in fact the ardency, or a better word is enthusiasm, and even a better word would be right attitude, the attitude of a winner, the attitude of can-do-this. And as that develops, it develops into the point of no matter what hindrances come into the mind, those can be cleaned out, and I can come back to this present moment to see how things are, right here, right now. You can see the truth of the moment. This actually is a quotation out of a sutta, and the next statement of it is that this first knowledge, that one can in fact clean out the mind and come back to this present moment, is the first step of the path. And it is supermundane. It is a factor of the path, it is noble, and it is not held by ordinary people. Ordinary people do not know that they can in fact clean out their mind, and even if they know that they can, they don't trust that they can do it just when they need to do it the most. So the first step of Srotapanna, the first step on the path, is the knowledge that no matter how much my mind gets messed up, I can turn that stuff around Immediately throw that stuff out, come out of the mental states into the senses, receive new data, be here in the present moment, and feel the way that I want to feel. Which means that now I have control over the way I feel, I have control over the breathing, I have control over the mind, that I am not driven by my own thoughts and my own belief systems. These are the four first items on the Eightfold Noble Path, and that leads to unification of mind— Samma, Arya, Samatha. When the mind is unified and organized, which means that all the cylinders are firing in the same direction, I suppose would be the way to say it. Only then, when we are organized and the mind is unified, is the mind then free from all desires and wants. And if you are in fact satisfied in the moment and free from desire, then you don't want anything. And if you don't want anything, you're unlikely to hurt someone, to steal it, to lie about it, or to break any of the precepts. The precepts are just naturally done when the mind is noble. So that's the Eightfold Noble Path for you. And so that ardency, or that right view— or excuse me, that right attitude, that can-do attitude— is a major aspect of the Eightfold Noble Path. But one will not develop that without also the right effort to put into it. And if they don't put in the right effort, that means they also don't develop Anapanasati to the point of remembering it often enough for it to be of any real value. It just happens occasionally, like when somebody goes to the meditation hall, and the whole rest of the day, all 23 hours of hindrances. What good is that kind of meditation? So Anapanasati is actually to be done whenever you remember to do it. And part of the skill that we're developing is to remember to do it. This is why we want to start putting Sati foremost, in the sense of everything we do. The way that the Anapanasati Sutta is actually stated is over and over and over and over again is Sati. You see that? Mindfully one breathes in, and mindfully one breathes out, which means you've got to do this with Sati, but it's a deep in-breath. Mindfully breathing in deep and mindfully breathing out deep. Now, what that means is deep and is kind of like slowing it down and getting more air in, but only a little bit more air, a comfortable amount. That this is not a contest of empty and full. This is a concept of a long, deep, easy, relaxed breath. That energizes the body and purifies the blood, because it throws out the carbon dioxide, which then gives a reason for more carbon dioxide to come into existence, because the frontal cortex is working better now. And so that breathing actually is a major part of the teaching of the Buddha, and they're only now beginning to understand that. But most of the breathing research that's done doesn't have the second part of it there. They're only working with the breathing without working with the mind. But in fact, you cannot learn to control the breathing if you can't learn to control the mind. So they kind of go hand in hand. And so that's why one's right effort is also to have wholesome thoughts, to put wholesome thoughts in the mind and to remove unwholesome thoughts. And kicked them out immediately. Dukkha, dukkha, Nirodha, which is the full-blown teaching of the Buddha. That's all he teaches is dukkha, dukkha, Nirodha. The way that it's practiced in the West though is dukkha, dukkha, dukkha, let me see some of that dukkha, I got to inspect that dukkha, I'm going to go really deep in and I'm going to understand that dukkha completely, and maybe someday I'll have some dukkha, Nirodha. But that's not the teaching of the Buddha. The teaching of the Buddha is Dukkha and Dukkha-Nirodha, right now in this present moment. Throw that stuff out. Throw out that ignorance and that wanting and that wanting to get rid of that greed, ill will, and delusion is the cause of our unsatisfactoriness. So practicing becoming satisfied is actually going into the Third Noble Truth, which is Freedom from Dukkha, which means now we don't want anything, we're satisfied. Right now is good enough. And so when we talk about bringing in joy, somebody will say, yeah, I've got joy, but I want more. It's not good enough joy, I should have great big joy, and I only have a little joy for me. Well, what that means is, is that they're actually developing being dissatisfied with even joy. Instead of having some joy and being satisfied that they've got a little. And then we begin to develop the skill of being joyful and develop the skill of being satisfied.

**Speaker B:** Question there: Would you recommend to each person, to every person who had the possibility to follow, uh, the— like this method, or do you think that it's like not for everyone?

**Speaker A:** I probably will never talk to everyone. I certainly will not talk to each and every person.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but we can go— we can

**Speaker A:** get down to how about the people who call on Skype?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But specifically, you see, one of them is grandiose. The everybody's in your mind is just a concept.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, but I have a specific, like, aspect I want you to answer, like the seclusion and training of the mind versus following goals that aren't meant to bring joy, but like people that feel that they're destined to do something, or that, yeah, something that, that's like involved with the world and not directly working with the mind.

**Speaker A:** Destiny, yeah, one of them is, is we can see destiny as a habit pattern of the mind, in the sense that if you look at the way that a gun is pointed, you could pretty much determine which direction the bullet's going to go if it's fired, right? Make it pretty much— in other words, if the gun is waving around towards your knees back and forth, you don't like that so much because if that gun goes off, you might lose a knee, right? So you begin to pay attention to guns and the way that they're— which direction they're pointed. This is an important point. So, the way things are headed, then, becomes a way of looking, that we start looking at things and see which directions they're going. So that we can recognize that this pathway that we've been on, this set of actions that we've set in motion, that have to do with initiation and response, followed by another, and we get into this thing that builds momentum, and so one kind of goes. An example of that is, "He who lives by the sword, dies by the sword." That's an understanding of destiny: which way are things headed? And we can see that the reason that things are headed in that direction is because that's the direction that they have been headed, and more than likely they're going to continue to head in that direction unless something changes. Now, there's a whole new way of looking at that for this moment, and that is that we can see that this destiny is also another way of thinking that in short terms, it's being driven, that we feel driven. An example of that is the guy who is a big, big fan of sport team A happens to be standing on a street corner where two guys are discussing the wonders and marvels of team B, and he's right there with them. Feels driven and compelled to start arguing with them. Yeah, okay, that's another way of looking— pardon?

**Speaker B:** Does he feel strongly about it?

**Speaker A:** Because he feels strongly about it. All right, so he feels driven, or he feels strongly about it, and yet he is not in control of those feelings at all. Those feelings came out of his past. If he were in this present moment, he could easily recognize whatever those guys are doing is their business, is not my business.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And he might have saved himself a bloody nose just by waking up to recognize this is not my business. Yeah. So, so that's an example of driven by this destiny, and is kind of also an example of living out in our past and continuing to go that way. So this is what Sati and right effort and the right view, leading to a change of attitude, is what the Buddhist teaching is all about, which basically means that you can change. A big issue in the time of the Buddha, and a big issue now within Christianity, is that you can't change. In fact, Christianity is absolutely built on all have sinned and come short of the glory of God. Who are you to think that you're good? Only God is good. You can't save yourself because you've got original sin. And you need our magic pill to save you. What's our— it's got Jesus written on this magic pill, right? That's the way that is taught, is taught that you cannot change, which means that you cannot resist this old nature that you've built up from childhood. And the Buddha says, yes, you can change, that you are not fixed. That you are not ground in, this is where the whole idea of anatta comes from, that the idea in the old days of the Buddha was that there was something, a self, that was actually more like a soul in Christianity, something that is so strong and so permanent and so fixed that it will even survive death. But it's also nothing but a football. And that God's going to kick you in any direction that he wants to. And, uh, their story is that not only will he kick you into heaven or hell after you're dead, but he does that now and you just don't know it. This is the Christian story, is that you are a permanent being that is, uh, subject to the will of God and that you don't have any choice in it. Yeah, this is their teaching. The Buddha says, oh no, you've got plenty of choice. You've got plenty of choice. Because why? Because you are not that kind of soul. You are not that kind of self. And when we recognize that, that means that now we not only can be free from the self, we can be free from all the confines of that self. Which is basically the first and the second fetter. The first fetter is personality view, and the personality view that we all have to get over is that I cannot change my own mind. That is hard to do. Okay, the answer to that is, well, it doesn't take long to change it right now. Just try it right now. Just do it right now. Never mind about the future. Just can we do it right now? Can we change our mind from being a, uh, a fraidy cat or a pity party or an Anicca or I'm gonna beat the hell out of you kind of attitude into, hey man, everything's cool. That's all we have to do, is begin to change our attitude and change our thoughts, and to be cool. But gosh, we have to remember doing it so often, because we have already started bending in a certain direction, which was the direction that we were bent by society when we were little kids. That humans are controlled by our society. The society would even say that the kid would become a barbarian if we don't train him.

**Speaker B:** Them.

**Speaker A:** You got to train up a child in the way he should go so when he is old he'll kiss your ass. That's in the Bible, but I changed the line.

**Speaker B:** Guide the child in this way so that when he's older he won't steer away from it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, we have to learn to bend to authority when we're children because when we're adults we won't do it. In fact, the last time that it can be done is when they take young men into the military. They Do not want 35-year-old men in the military, because when a drill sergeant says, "Attention," the 35-year-old is going to be the last one to stand up. They certainly don't want 70-year-olds in their military, because the 70-year-old is not even going to bother to stand up. No, they want them to be 18, so that they can make put the fear of doing it our way into them.

**Speaker B:** Were you ever in the military?

**Speaker A:** Oh yes, U.S. Navy. Wow. Not long enough, or too long.

**Speaker B:** I was in a U.S. military medical ship once. They came here. Some years ago, a U.S. military ship that was providing medical aid came to the Caribbean coast here, and that was my only experience with military people. But it was weird, like, seeing them stick to such a strict regime and like And also seeing how similar it was to how they depicted the stereotypical people in the movies. But yeah, it's a hard life, definitely.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's very characteristic though that that's what our society does for us. In microcosm, so that we get in line and we start marching according to the educational system, start marching towards the way that big business is guiding us. An example of that is the iPhone, Apple. But 40, 50 years ago, it was the Mustang and the hot rod. All right, so consumer goods and consumer products drives our desires. In fact, I talk about it in the sense of the GREB, G-R-E-B. We have big government, big religion, big education, and big business, and they're all telling you the same thing that the Christians tell you. And that is, you need our help, you can't do it without us, you're not good enough to do it on your own. The business then adds the line, you need our product. And the education says, you need our knowledge. And the government says, you need us to fix all of your business problems. And the religion says, well, you know what they say. They say we own you already anyway.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they have us threatened with hell.

**Speaker A:** And so all of them operate on fear. Well, we have built a society that's quite safe. I mean, if you think about it, 600,000 years ago, life was pretty tough, lots of dangers, too many alligators, too many lions, not enough elephant guns, all kinds of problems. And so, fear. Is an emotion that actually predates even mammals, that in fact we can even see evidence of fish schooling that gives rise to wildebeests and zebras herding together. And that gives rise to humans wanting to have a nest, wanting to have society. To go along, to get along.

**Speaker B:** The herding instinct.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that we are in fact being herded around because we're too stupid to wake up to the fact that we are being herded around. And when we recognize it, we can put a stop to it. We can see that danger. But until we do, we're satisfied in a way. We get some sort of reward for going along to get along, and that is that going along to get along at least keeps us safe for the moment, because if we don't go along to get along, we might get eaten by the bears. OK, so it's very, very little relief, but we're willing to take it and also have to suffer the dangers from it. And so much of the teaching of the Buddha is to wake up to the dangers that we normally see gratification in, especially the kind of thoughts that we have, so that if we see that there is danger in that kind of thinking, then we can put that thought down and start thinking thoughts that have no danger built in them at all.

**Speaker B:** Like—

**Speaker A:** pardon?

**Speaker B:** Like the breath, or do you mean— oh yeah, I had a question a while ago about the, how do you say, the positive thinking. I don't know, I don't remember the term you used, but I've tried like the other way around to like in a scientific way to prove by the contrary. Like I started thinking a lot of negative things and I see how that— and I saw how that affected my my demeanor, my state of my emotional state in the moment. Even though it was like, it were like very tacky, corny thoughts. And I was wondering if that works like on the opposite, if corny thoughts, corny positive thoughts work well too? Or do you have like any recommendations on how to shape that positive thinking?

**Speaker A:** Well, first off, let's determine a bit about the distinction between positive thinking and wholesome thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, wholesome thoughts. Sorry.

**Speaker A:** Okay. When we use the term power of positive thinking, normally what that refers to is affirmations or hoping or pretending or thinking that if I think about it, I'll get what I'm thinking about. The power of attraction or whatever like that. So you have the teenage girl standing in front of the mirror telling herself how beautiful she is with these powerful positive thoughts, but she really doesn't believe it deep inside anyway. And so when she goes out to school, any little thing that's said and she feels terrible. If she actually thought she was beautiful, then those kinds of words wouldn't harm her at all. And so the distinction between positive thoughts are often that they're not real, that they're really just affirmations that really deep inside that we don't believe it. That really what we're looking for then would be wholesome thoughts that would always be true in this moment. An example of that is this breath is life-giving. Another one would be this breath actually is delicious. It's a relief. If you don't believe that, then stop breathing for 5 or 10 minutes and then see what that first next breath is going to be like. You'll really like it. Okay, sure.

**Speaker B:** I've tried that, but like after sometimes you get sort of tired or the mind gets— the monkey mind gets bored and that wholesome thought like starts to lose effectiveness, you know.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's to be expected. That's because of the habits that you've already built up of unwholesome thoughts over and over and over again. But the easy way to say it is, look, you have been spending your whole life talking yourself into feeling bad. Now it's time to start talking yourself into feeling good. And pretty soon, or someday, that's all you'll have to say. But right now, you're still telling yourself a lot of trash. At least now start to put some good stuff in there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you always mentioned that example. Like, do the wholesome thoughts limit themselves to that, to the breath, or do you have any other pointers?

**Speaker A:** Oh no, any thought that has to do with the reality of the situation, which is all of your senses. Okay, that in fact you really do appreciate your sight. If you don't believe me, go around for a day or two completely blindfolded intentionally so that you cannot see anything. Boy, will that wake up the other senses! Blind people are known to have extraordinary senses of their surroundings and sounds and things like this, that they're paying attention to stuff that most people don't pay attention to at all. So that's one of the practices, is to go around blindfold, because it wakes you up. You mean the other one is to go around barefooted, because then you have to watch where you're stepping. You have to notice what's going on.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Have you at all made that part of your practice?

**Speaker A:** Pardon? Over the years, sure, I've done all this stuff.

**Speaker B:** I'll try that then. So another way to say it is, apart from thoughts about the breath, then another category you could say is affirmations you do believe in. The girl won't say, yeah, I'm beautiful, and then crumble. But she might say, why do you

**Speaker A:** want to be beautiful? What good is that?

**Speaker B:** Oh, you know, desires and such, right?

**Speaker A:** That's the desire. So I am beautiful, that's an affirmation. You really don't believe it. You're as ugly as you know you are. Yeah, and it doesn't matter. Oh yeah, then in fact the, the, the, the funny part is, is that I don't have to look at me. Everybody else has to put up with how ugly I am, but I don't even have to look at it. I haven't been in front of a mirror in a long time.

**Speaker B:** Was it, was it like a conscious decision? I won't face mirrors.

**Speaker A:** Actually, yes, but it happened before I was a monk. But that's actually part of the stuff that monks are not allowed. And I think that had to do not with the fact that it's a looking glass or a mirror, but that it was almost in those days had to be made out of metal, which was almost always precious. Okay, so in those days, a looking glass was valuable, which meant that it could be stolen, which then meant the monk would have felt a sense of loss and maybe blame somebody else. And so the best thing to do is let's not have any of those kind of things around. But it wound up being part of the tradition that monks don't need— and guess what? You don't need a mirror. Yeah, the only, the only reason you should have a mirror is to go find fault with yourself so that you'll go buy something. So the stores are the ones who want you to have mirrors in your house. If you don't have any mirrors, you probably don't go to the store because you don't care.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** beauty is also in the eye of the beholder. And often the beauty is not the object. Very rarely do we ever practice what you see is what you get. Generally what happens is the guy will go into the 7-Eleven or whatever, and he's got a drop-dead gorgeous babe right there behind the counter. And when he leaves the store, he's thinking about her. But guess what? He's not thinking about her; he's thinking about the mental image that he constructed about her. The mental image that he constructed about her fails to mention some of the reality of the situation, that she's got two ex-husbands, she's got three kids at home, she's got a mother who hates any man who comes within an inch of her, and both of the ex-husbands hate each other and are out to kill each other. Okay, but when you see her on the street, you don't see any of that kind of stuff. There's realities that— but we don't put that into our imagination. So in fact, all we have inside the mind is just a fantasy. But now guess what? We want our fantasy. So if we go back to see the girl thinking that this girl is my fantasy girl— no, the fantasy is in the mind. This girl is a real person.

**Speaker B:** But they have like a strong pull, these fantasies, right?

**Speaker A:** So we fantasize and we create and mentalize what we want, and then reality doesn't meet up to it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So the way to start to practice Anapanasati with this 8 old noble path is to wake up, to look at the thought, to take a deep breath, and to recognize, I don't have to think about that, whatever it was. I can think of something better than that to do, like sit here and just look out and gaze upon the beautiful— whatever those things are out there— and bushes or something. Actually, they're ferns, ancient, ancient Burns, big ones, big, big burns, right? 30 feet at least. So anyway, that's all conjecture. The reality is, is that it's a visual image, is quite pleasant. So just being in the here now is also safe. My thoughts are dangerous. I can find all kinds of work to do. I can find all kinds of things that are unfinished, that need— this world is in great need of all kinds of things. You don't believe me? CNN or Fox or something.

**Speaker B:** No, thank you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but this present moment is just pleasant. It's just so nice just to be here now, wherever you are and whatever posture you are in right now is good enough. And that's the practice of Anapanasati, literally talking ourselves into being satisfied. Talking ourselves into being safe, comfortable, content, secure, and the cream of it is satisfied. This is good enough. I don't want anything. That state of satisfaction is in fact just the opposite of Dukkha. It's that language in the Pali. It's that language in the Thai and in Gujarati. In the Pali, Dukkha and Sukkha are opposites. In Thai, Dukkha and Sukkha are opposites. In Gujarati, Dukkhi and Sukkhi are opposites.

**Speaker B:** I've never heard of that language. I had never heard of that language. No.

**Speaker A:** Gujarati? It's in India, it's in northwest India, in Gujarat. It's an Indo-European language, to where Thai borrowed the words out of Buddhism. So, this opposite of Dukkha, if the All the teachings of the Buddha are about how coming out of Dukkha into Sukkha means coming out of our dissatisfaction state and become satisfied, content, comfortable, with the feeling of security that only mastery will bring. And so, we have to master the mind. Take control of the mind, take control of the breathing, take control of the way that we feel. And by doing so, we're on top of the world. That's what supermundane means, is being on top of the world. You're an emperor of your own pile of dirt. Are you going to be buried under your pile of dirt or sitting on top? Sitting on top of the world sounds like the right way to be. Just don't care about it, just let it go. And we can do that anytime that we can remember to do it. You can feel right now the way that you feel. You can remember this, and you can feel this way anytime that you want to— satisfied and content. And if you practice that enough over and over again, we begin to add that fourth ingredient, Samma Sanghappa, which is the right attitude of I can do this anytime. That's also the association with the Piti, that yeehaw or that exhilaration of the knowledge that I've won, because I know that I can win any time that I want. Any time that I want to win over Dukkha, I can win over Dukkha. And so we get that feeling of power. The Buddha called himself a lion any minute. That lion is that attitude. But that attitude comes with mastery, and so that building up of the skills brings on that feeling of can-do. It's a can-do attitude. We come out of the victim's position into the winner's position. One example is, uh, it's kind of a joke. You hear this often, but you've probably heard this: "Hold my beer." You know what that means? It means you hold this beer because I've got business and I'm going to win this business. I'm the champion here. That's the kind of attitude that we're looking for, is the attitude of "I can do this."

**Speaker B:** Anicca, Anagami, Anapanasati.

**Speaker A:** Or as they would do it in the comedy Westerns or war movies, "Give me a swig of that Sati, I'm ready to go." Yeah, Sati, that's the key, to wake up. Anytime and to recognize that you're okay, that this breath is keeping you alive and you're sitting here and happy. Not fat Dhamma happy, just happy. Yeah, wisely happy.

**Speaker B:** Right now I can't manage happy, but right now I can manage like being at least up to the head in my garbage, like stick out of the head.

**Speaker A:** Is that satisfying?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it is.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that's the point. Yeah, become satisfied with what you've got right now. That's the skill to be developed. A clear example: guy wants to learn to play the piano. He buys the piano, goes to the store, he buys all kinds of music books, simple ones and hard ones. He takes a lesson from a piano teacher and goes back to the piano teacher the second lesson, but in between there, he doesn't practice the piano at all. He really wants to learn to play the piano, but he's not practicing the piano. Let's say he's practicing the flute, or the violin, or guitar, or maybe something not at all musical. Will he learn to play the piano that way? How are you going to learn to play satisfaction if you don't practice satisfaction? If you're going to learn to play the piano, you've got to play the piano.

**Speaker B:** Some people get struck in the head and they learn spontaneously to play instruments.

**Speaker A:** After some practice.

**Speaker B:** I have to research, study the data.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** No, it's just that I heard some a while ago that there were registered cases from people that get head concussions and spontaneously learn abilities. But it was just like a passing thing to mention.

**Speaker A:** All right, I tell you what, give me your address and I'll mail you a hammer and you don't have to call me anymore.

**Speaker B:** It was a joke.

**Speaker A:** I know. I won't give you. Ah, okay, right. Yes, that's the whole point. That— excuse me. Yeah,

**Speaker B:** getting pretty late here. I think I have to leave soon.

**Speaker A:** All right. Well, we haven't really gotten into much of the detail of the practice yet. So I know, uh, we can finish that at a later time.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I just want to call back

**Speaker A:** again,

**Speaker B:** maybe on Monday or Tuesday. Monday.

**Speaker A:** All right, that'll be fine.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I, I, um, I just had the time until now, but I wanted to take the opportunity now just to start the conversation.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And I appreciate, uh, yeah, you sharing the time.

**Speaker A:** Well, I've enjoyed it. It's been fun. Me too. All right, we'll see you later. Yeah.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) in dialogue with a Sangha friend (Speaker B), centers on a critique of common Western meditation approaches and a return to the core principles of the Buddha's teachings, particularly **Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing) as the practical application of the Noble Eightfold Path.**

Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Critique: Modern vs. Authentic Practice**
*   **Modern "Western Buddhism":** Dhammarato criticizes popular methods (like Goenka's and Mahasi's) as inventions from 1950s Burma, designed for large-group retreats. He argues they often miss essential elements of the Buddha's path, promoting extremes of either "choiceless awareness" (too little effort) or strained "deep meditation" (too much effort).
*   **Authentic Buddha's Way:** True practice, as per the suttas, is based on **seclusion** (forest, empty hut), **personal guidance** (one-on-one like this talk), and integrating meditation with daily life, not confining it to a hall.

### **The Heart of Practice: Anapanasati & the Eightfold Path**
The central teaching is that **Anapanasati is the practice of the Noble Eightfold Path**. The focus is on four key factors:
1.  **Right Effort (Samma Vayama):** Defined uniquely as **"doing the least amount of work possible to get the job done."** It's the balanced effort to cultivate wholesome states and abandon unwholesome ones *immediately*, avoiding the two extremes of laziness and strain.
2.  **Right Mindfulness (Samma Sati):** "Waking up" to the present moment. It's remembering to practice and be aware.
3.  **Right View (Samma Ditthi):** Seeing things as they are *right now*, clearly.
4.  **Right Intention/Attitude (Samma Sankappa):** The "can-do," enthusiastic, and winning attitude of a practitioner who knows they can master their mind.

### **Key Practical Instructions**
*   **Start Where You Are:** The first "supermundane" step on the path is the knowledge that **you can always clean out your mind** and return to the present, taking control of your feelings and thoughts.
*   **Cultivate Satisfaction (Sukkha):** The goal is the **cessation of *dukkha* (unsatisfactoriness) *right now*.** Practice "talking yourself into being satisfied" with the present moment—safe, comfortable, and content. This is the direct opposite of *dukkha*.
*   **Use the Senses, Drop the Stories:** Shift from being lost in mental stories (the mind sense) to being present with **the other five senses** (sight, sound, etc.), which connect you to reality "here and now."
*   **Thought Work:** Actively replace unwholesome, negative, or fantasy-based thoughts with **wholesome thoughts** grounded in present-moment reality (e.g., "This breath is life-giving"). You've spent a lifetime talking yourself into feeling bad; now talk yourself into feeling good.
*   **Full-Body Awareness:** Practice involves waking up the **whole body**—noticing posture, expressions, and sensations—not just focusing on a single point like the nose tip, which he calls a later "toy" and not found in the suttas.

### **Broader Philosophical Points**
*   **You Can Change:** Buddhism rejects the idea of a fixed self/soul. You have choice and can break free from habitual "destiny" or conditioning imposed by society (government, religion, education, business—"GREB"), which operates on fear and dependence.
*   **Mastery Leads to Freedom:** By mastering the mind, breath, and feelings, you move from a "victim's position" to a "winner's position." This mastery generates *piti* (joy/rapture) and the confident, "lion-like" attitude of an arahant.
*   **Practice is Moment-to-Moment:** True Anapanasati is practiced **whenever you remember**, throughout the day, not just in formal sessions. The skill is in remembering to return to satisfaction.

### **Conclusion**
The talk is a call to move beyond rigid, modern techniques and return to the flexible, path-oriented core of the Buddha's teachings. The practice is framed as a moment-to-moment cultivation of **right effort, mindfulness, and attitude** to directly uproot *dukkha* and **cultivate satisfaction** here and now, leading to mastery and freedom.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary **metaphors and stories** used by Speaker A are:

**1. The "First-Grade Classroom" vs. "PhD Research Project" Metaphor**
*   **Purpose:** To contrast the structured, uniform environment of modern meditation retreats (which he links to a 1950s Burmese military government model) with the individualized, investigative nature of the Buddha's teachings.
*   **Quote:** *"the 10-day retreats are often set up like a first-grade classroom... a PhD research project is not set up in rows of chairs."*

**2. The "Gun Pointing" Metaphor for Destiny/Karma**
*   **Purpose:** To explain destiny or habitual patterns (*sankhara*) as momentum from past actions, not as an unchangeable fate.
*   **Quote:** *"if you look at the way that a gun is pointed, you could pretty much determine which direction the bullet's going to go if it's fired... The way things are headed... becomes a way of looking."*

**3. The "Skin in the Game" / "Whole Body" Metaphor**
*   **Purpose:** To emphasize that right effort and mindfulness require full somatic engagement, not just mental observation.
*   **Quote:** *"you have to put some skin in the game... The whole body has to get into the practice. You have to wake up the whole body."*

**4. The "GREB" Acronym Story (Government, Religion, Education, Business)**
*   **Purpose:** To illustrate how societal institutions foster dependence and fear, contrasting with the Buddha's message of self-reliance and freedom.
*   **Quote:** *"big government, big religion, big education, and big business... all telling you... you need our help, you can't do it without us."*

**5. The "Herding Instinct" Evolutionary Story**
*   **Purpose:** To explain the deep-seated human tendency towards conformity and safety in groups, which meditation practice helps one see through.
*   **Quote:** *"fear... predates even mammals... we are in fact being herded around because we're too stupid to wake up to the fact that we are being herded around."*

**6. The "Fantasy Girl vs. Real Person" Anecdote**
*   **Purpose:** To distinguish between mental fantasy/projection (which causes suffering) and present-moment sensory reality.
*   **Quote:** *"The guy... sees a gorgeous babe... He's thinking about the mental image he constructed... The fantasy is in the mind. This girl is a real person."*

**7. The "Learning to Play the Piano" Metaphor**
*   **Purpose:** To stress that mastery (of satisfaction, the mind, or the Dhamma) requires specific, consistent practice, not just desire or theoretical knowledge.
*   **Quote:** *"How are you going to learn to play satisfaction if you don't practice satisfaction? If you're going to learn to play the piano, you've got to play the piano."*

**8. The "Sitting on Top of Your Pile of Dirt" Metaphor**
*   **Purpose:** To vividly describe the "supermundane" achievement of mastery over one's mind and life.
*   **Quote:** *"You're an emperor of your own pile of dirt. Are you going to be buried under your pile of dirt or sitting on top?"*

**9. The "Hold My Beer" Pop-Culture Reference**
*   **Purpose:** To humorously encapsulate the "right attitude" (*samma sankappa*) of confident, capable mastery.
*   **Quote:** *"'Hold my beer'... means... I'm the champion here. That's the kind of attitude we're looking for."*

**10. The "Blindfold / Barefoot" Practice Analogy**
*   **Purpose:** Not a story, but a suggested practice framed as a story to explain how to awaken sensory awareness.
*   **Quote:** *"go around blindfold... it wakes you up... go around barefooted, because then you have to watch where you're stepping."*

**Core Narrative Through-Line:**
Speaker A weaves these metaphors into a larger **contrasting story** between:
*   **Modern/Westernized Buddhism:** Characterized by group retreats, passive learning, over/under-effort, and an emphasis on dissecting suffering (*dukkha*).
*   **The Buddha's Original Teaching:** Characterized by personal practice, one-on-one guidance, "right effort," and the immediate cultivation of satisfaction and mastery (*sukkha*).

This narrative frames the entire discussion, using metaphors to make abstract points (about effort, awareness, and societal conditioning) concrete and memorable.
