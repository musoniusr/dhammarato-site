### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So we're going to start with just taking a long deep in-breath, followed by a long relaxing out-breath. Always a good place to get started. And then, under the concept of gladdening the mind, or brightening the mind, the kind of thoughts that we're going to have are going to be happy, intentional, wholesome thoughts. So we can start out with everything is okay, everything is fine, not a worry in the world, no place to go and nothing to do. Wow, isn't that nice? The job that needs to be done is to just relax with wholesome thoughts. We can do that job. We're very good at it. We've done it many times. And then we take another deep breath, long breath. Everything is okay. And as we breathe out, we can use the word relax. Oh, it feels good to relax. Everything's okay, not a worry in the world. All is well. The Anapanasati stuff is easy. Wow, I like it. It's good stuff. I feel good when I'm practicing. Feel good enough. Everything is okay. Everything is fine. And then sometimes the mind will wander away. Never mind. Start again. Come back, come back. Take another deep long in-breath and another sigh. Wow, I was glad to come back and to just be okay. Not a worry in the world. Nothing dangerous, no problems to solve. Isn't that nice to have done the job so that the job is done now? No problems, no worries, no jobs to do. We can just sit here and feel nice. Safe, secure, and comfortable leads one to satisfaction. We can feel satisfied. Take another deep breath. Feels so good to be satisfied. And then on the out-breath, I just let it all go. The air we breathe is nurturing. It's life-giving. You can think of it as nature itself. You breathe in nature. And then you give it all back on the out-breath. You breathe in the very best there is, full of life, and then you breathe out, throw out all of the problems. Everything is okay. And as we breathe in and we breathe out, we relax. We go into a really deeper, deeper state of relaxation. Imagine that you're going down, down, down in an elevator, and every in-breath that you take and every out-breath that you take, you go deeper and deeper into relaxation. Down, down, Oh, so nice. Down to a place where there's no problems, no worries. Everything is kind of a blue color, very cool. Imagine that you're in a basement, or maybe even an ice cave, to where everything is just so cool, so relaxing, and all the problems of the world are way far away up on the surface. We're way down here in the deep, dark, beautiful, comfortable, not much of anything. Oh, it's so nice. And if the mind wanders away, never mind, just start again. Come back, come back to that beautiful state where nothing is happening. All the jobs have been done. No worries, no burdens. Everything is okay. These deep, long breaths are life-giving, energizing. You feel good. And so at the end of our little time, we can come back, open the eyes, come back to reality full of vim, vigor, vitality. We've got all the energy we need to do nothing at all. Everything is okay, everything is beautiful. And so I'm going to count 3 now, and as we count 3, we We're going to open our eyes, take a deep breath, and put a great big smile on. Wow, it's been so nice to have nothing to do and no place to go. 1. Wow, I feel so good. 2. Everything is okay. 3. I feel good. I feel good.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato, is a guided meditation focused on **Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing)** with a strong emphasis on **gladdening and relaxing the mind**.

Here is a summary of the key points and structure:

**1. Core Purpose:** To cultivate a happy, bright, and worry-free mind through intentional, wholesome thoughts combined with conscious breathing.

**2. Primary Method:**
*   **Wholesome Suggestions:** The guide repeatedly uses phrases like "Everything is okay," "No worries," "All is well," and "Feel good" to set a positive mental tone.
*   **Breath as Anchor:** Long, deep breaths are used to initiate and deepen relaxation. The out-breath is explicitly linked to letting go.
*   **Gentle Attitude:** Wandering mind is met with "Never mind. Start again." This emphasizes kindness and non-judgment in practice.

**3. Progressive Stages:**
*   **Starting Point:** Establishing initial relaxation and the thought that there is "nothing to do."
*   **Deepening:** Using imagery (e.g., an elevator going down, a cool blue cave) to symbolize moving into deeper states of calm, away from surface-world problems.
*   **Integration:** The breath is framed as a nurturing, life-giving exchange with nature.
*   **Conclusion:** Returning to ordinary awareness feeling refreshed, energized ("vim, vigor, vitality"), and satisfied, carrying the "everything is okay" attitude forward.

**4. Essential Message:** Meditation is presented as a pleasurable, nourishing job—the job of relaxing and gladdening the mind. Success is found in the simple, repeated act of returning to a baseline of safety and satisfaction, using the breath as a vehicle.

In essence, this is a **samatha (tranquility)-focused session** designed to produce a joyful, serene, and energized mind through positive autosuggestion and mindful breathing.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several key metaphors and a brief narrative to guide the relaxation/meditation exercise:

**Metaphors:**

1.  **The Job/Work:** The practice itself is framed as a "job" that needs to be done, but it's a uniquely pleasant one—the job of relaxing and having wholesome thoughts. The speaker emphasizes that "the job is done now," meaning the goal is to reach a state where striving ceases.
2.  **Breath as Nature/Life Force:** The air is described as "nurturing" and "life-giving." The speaker personifies it: "You breathe in nature... You breathe in the very best there is, full of life, and then you breathe out, throw out all of the problems."
3.  **The Elevator Descent:** Relaxation is visualized as a journey downward: "Imagine that you're going down, down, down in an elevator... you go deeper and deeper into relaxation." This creates a spatial metaphor for deepening mental and physical calm.
4.  **The Basement/Ice Cave:** The state of deep relaxation is pictured as a physical location "way down here"—a "basement, or maybe even an ice cave." This place is described as "cool," "deep, dark, beautiful, comfortable," and separate from the world's problems, which are "way far away up on the surface." This metaphor reinforces safety, isolation, and tranquility.
5.  **Color (Blue):** The deep state is associated with the color blue, which is often linked to calmness, coolness, and peace: "Everything is kind of a blue color, very cool."

**Story/Narrative Arc:**
While not a traditional story with characters, the talk follows a **mini-narrative journey**:

*   **Beginning:** A call to start from the present state with a breath.
*   **Establishing the Theme:** Introducing the "job" of gladdening the mind with wholesome thoughts ("everything is okay").
*   **Challenge & Solution:** Acknowledging that the "mind will wander" (the challenge) and gently instructing to "come back, come back" (the solution).
*   **The Journey:** Leading the listener on a descent (via the elevator metaphor) to a specific, peaceful place (the basement/ice cave).
*   **Resolution & Return:** After dwelling in that deep state, the narrative guides a return "back to reality," but now refreshed and energized ("full of vim, vigor, vitality").

**Overall Purpose:** These metaphors and the narrative arc work together to make the abstract process of meditation tangible. They provide concrete images (elevator, cave) and a sense of movement and destination, helping the listener navigate their internal experience toward a goal of deep relaxation and mental quiet.
