### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Well, David, I'm glad to see you again.

**Speaker B:** Good to see you.

**Speaker A:** You, uh, a few minutes ago you mentioned, uh, the word acceptance in the sense of accepting the, uh, the interior unwholesome thoughts. Yeah, yeah, that's, that's a very, very typical mistake that's made in the West. Generally, if we're going to think about acceptance, that means to accept the outside world or to accept what's coming into us through our senses, and that we put up with the outside world. We can't do that if we have unwholesome thoughts, because the unwholesome thoughts will be to not accept what's on the outside world. So if you have the idea that, oh, I have to accept my own unwholesome thoughts, now you're going in two different— going in the wrong direction in two different ways. Because by continuing to allow the unwholesome thoughts in the mind and accepting that, you're in Dukkha. And then when something happens from the outside and you don't accept it, that's just more Dukkha. So when we change it around to recognize that, oh, The outside world is not my problem, I can't fix it. That's not the work to do. The real work to do, or the one's right effort, is to take what's in the mind and to change that into something wholesome, so that then with that wholesome, we can actually then accept what's coming in from the outside world.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay, but this is a common mistake that students make, and I think that it has to do with the concept of noting.

**Speaker B:** I've heard of that before, noting versus noticing, right?

**Speaker A:** Uh, yeah, technically, uh, it doesn't matter which words we use if we don't define them correctly. There is a phrase that I had heard many, many years ago. I think I'd probably heard this before I'd ever heard about Maharshi, and that was to note it well and to let it pass. Now that's different. Noting it well and letting it pass is completely different than noting and noting and noting and noting. Yeah, that in fact noting it well and letting it pass is absolutely wholesome, to let that stuff go, to turn it loose, to change the mind from that to something else. And then in fact, when we are caught in, let us say, an unwholesome thought, then we are in that unwholesome thought. But when we catch it in the sense of recognizing that it's an unwholesome thought, that's a new thought.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, we actually come out of that thought and have a new thought about the thought that we just had. That shows that in fact the mind is— Freud calls it free association. And a lot of people think that once they get their mind stuck on something, that it's really hard to get it off. And that's not true. It really is very easy to get the mind off of whatever we were thinking about, but it's also very easy for the mind to come right back to it, right? And so we have to know the distinction between, uh, being, let us say, uh, ground into a certain pattern of thought versus the fact that no, we can come out of that. And if we can come out of it, even if we go back into it, we can still come back out of it again. That this is the real training, is to not try to completely eliminate a thought as if, oh, That's an unwholesome thought, and now I'm making the strong determination I'll never have that thought again, because the thought will come again, and when it does, you'll feel bad.

**Speaker B:** It doesn't work to just— you can't will your thoughts. What I've always tried to do is just bring my attention— Not yet. Excuse me.

**Speaker A:** You don't have the skills. And that's what this is all about, is to develop the skills of having the thoughts that you want to have and to not have the thoughts that are unwholesome. So we can also understand it from the perspective that when the unwholesome thought is seen and removed, that's a relief. That's a relief. That's Completing a task. It's like carrying around a huge backpack all day because you're out traveling or something, and then you finally set it down. What a relief it is to put that big heavy backpack down, to set it down and take the burden off. This is the way that the Buddha approaches it. When he's talking about the five hindrances, there are five analogies, and these five analogies work with the five hindrances, but you wouldn't say that one analogy is for each individual hindrance. This analogy for that hindrance, this analogy for this hindrance, etc., but rather to think of the analogies are interrelated and that more than one analogy will fit for more than one of the hindrances. And so what it does is it tends to draw the hindrances together to realize that the hindrances are just hindrances and that all of them have the same commonality that we can see through these 5 analogies. So the first analogy is being sick, let us say in the hospital. And when you go to the hospital because you're sick, you want to be in the hospital, you want to be taken care of. But then in the hospital, everybody gets the idea that, hey, wait a minute, I'm okay now, I want out of here. Right, everybody wants out of the hospital, and generally from the time that the doctor says that, okay, you can go, let me go get the paperwork, until the time you actually walk out of the hospital is an extraordinarily long period of time. Hours sometimes, or a minute, but whatever, you're really wanting to go. You feel better.

**Speaker B:** So that's happened to me before.

**Speaker A:** Right, when you're sick, you want to be in the hospital, but when you get better, you want out of there. This is also the same thing with the hindrances, is that the hindrances make us sick, but when we get free from the hindrances, it's very much like getting over an illness, and now we're ready to get out of here. We don't want to be in the hospital anymore. Okay, so that's the first analogy. The second analogy is surprisingly similar in the sense of prison, that a prisoner is in prison and he's got a long sentence and he sees no escape, and all of the legal work is a drudgery and everything. And then all of a sudden something happens and he's sprung from jail. Maybe the president gives amnesty, or a pardon or something, and now he's out of jail. And so imagine the feeling of being set free after spending months and months or years in prison, right? Okay. The next analogy is the analogy of being a servant or being employed. In the example, the servant has to get up before the king has to dress himself, and then he has to dress the king and feed the king and follow the king around all day to make sure that the king has what he wants. And then he dresses the king for bed and puts the king to bed, and only after that can now the servant rest. And then imagine that the king fires him. Wow, what a relief it is! Now I don't have to get up at 6 in the morning and work until 9. That I have freedom, finally. I can go and do what I want. Well, you can see how all three of these have a certain kind of undertone or a thread to them.

**Speaker B:** Well, yeah, desire, right?

**Speaker A:** That you want to be out of this. Yeah, get out of it.

**Speaker B:** And now.

**Speaker A:** And so the fourth one then is the analogy of being in debt, that you owe somebody something and then you get it paid off. And what a relief that is. Have you ever been in debt and then paid it off?

**Speaker B:** Uh, yes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and it feels like a relief, doesn't it? Wow, you don't have to do that one anymore.

**Speaker B:** Don't have to worry about that hanging over the head anymore.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Well, that's similar to, in fact, having the work to do to take care of the king. Like the servant has debts to pay, and so he's got to work, right? If he doesn't pay the debts, he's going to go to jail. Or worse still, if he owes the money to the wrong guy, he's going to wind up in the hospital, right? Okay, so you can see how all of these things fit together. The next one and the last one is the analogy of being on a journey with all of your baggage.

**Speaker B:** Uh-huh.

**Speaker A:** That's why I brought up the issue of the backpack, because when we're out on a journey, we have to watch our baggage. If we're carrying more than one bag, then we have to be very special careful about them, because let us say if we have to go to the bus depot counter or whatever, we've got to manage that baggage while we're getting the ticket. That's one of the reasons why ticket counters are so crowded, is because everybody's got their baggage there with them. They can't set it over there in the corner, baggage will walk off. Well, yeah, so we— yeah, we need somebody. We have to— you have to— right. And that's one of the good reasons for people to travel in groups, except now instead of looking for your baggage, you've got everybody's baggage to take care of and all of those people too. So when you get home finally, you just set all of that baggage down and relax. Very, very few people, the first thing they do when they arrive home is unpack their bags. Nobody does that. Sometimes bags don't get unpacked for days or weeks. They want to be finished with it, right? And so now we have these 5 analogies, and all 5 of them with the hindrances have the quality of relief, the relief of having those kind of thoughts out of the mind.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I gotcha. So the payoff is the relief, right?

**Speaker A:** The trade-off is the release. I don't have to think about that anymore, like that conversation that I was having with Billy Bob in my own mind, because I'll probably see him tomorrow and there's all of the stuff that we've got to straighten out, right? And so here I go in my mind with Billy Bob and Billy Bob and Billy Bob, and then I can say, wait a minute, Billy Bob is not here right now. I don't have to deal with Billy Bob right now. Why am I dealing with him right now in my mind? Why can't I just be happy for a minute, just relax, take a deep breath, and not have to deal with Billy Bob, or actually anything in the future. That we need to get into the state of being able to say, I'll deal with it later. That's not to be dealt with now. That future event, the future— let the future take care of itself. Let the past be done, because you're not who you were in the past. You're something new now. And so just letting the past go and let the future go, and to have wholesome thoughts that are wholesome because they're about the right now, the here now. Okay. Generally, when we feel afraid or dangerous, that's because of something that we're thinking about that might happen, or something happened that was a close call or something like that in the past. But in this present moment, everything is safe. You really are safe right now. I mean, look around. There's no alligators in the room. I don't see a big snake on your bed. The dog is not being eaten by a bear right now. Everything is okay.

**Speaker B:** It is.

**Speaker A:** And so this is part of what we need to do, is to look around to recognize with wisdom that we really are safe right now. That there really is nothing to do and no place to go, and everything that needed to be done is done. And so we need to actually practice doing that.

**Speaker B:** Last time we discussed triggers. Um, I have been having a difficult time when— because there have been a lot of those lately, and when I've been susceptible because I've been tired I find myself reacting. Is it just a matter of practice, a matter of repetition, that eventually when the really strong ones happen, you can see right through them?

**Speaker A:** I will tell you what. Let's add some new triggers. Okay? Every time you use the word tired, let that even verbally or mentally, every time you think of being tired, Anytime that anything has to do with tired, that's going to be a trigger for you to take a deep breath. All right. Okay. Whenever you think tiredness is— okay, I don't have to feel tired. I can take a deep breath and start cleaning out some of the tired juice that's in the blood. Let that old carbon dioxide out, and let the body breathe in more oxygen, so that the body and the brain becomes more oxygenated, so that you won't feel so tired. But everybody feels tired. A lot of people, in fact, I would say that the older people get, the more tired they are waking up in the morning. And part of the reason why we wake up tired in the morning is because in the night we haven't been getting all the breathing, all the air that we could use. This is why the Buddha would recommend that we sleep on the side rather than on the back. In fact, in COVID, when it first happened, they were losing so many people, were dying, they were putting them on respirators and not coming off, and they found out the problem was that people were laying on their back, which meant that the lower part of the lung systems were being collapsed by the beds, and so they couldn't breathe anyway. And so they tried to— a CPAP

**Speaker B:** machine, which keeps my airway open. It blows— it's like a constant pressure device. So my sleep issues are related to a physiological problem that I'm working on.

**Speaker A:** So, oh, all right, well, let's start with that then right now. Let's start working with your posture in bed. To start sleeping on your side. If you sleep on your stomach and your chest, then the whole weight of the body is preventing you from being able to breathe. If you sleep on your back, then the lower part of the lungs don't get open at all. But if you sleep on your side, either on the left or the right side, then that lets the rib cage flow easily on your side. So the way to practice this is to just remember when you're laying in bed at night to sleep on— to lay down on your side every time you can remember, and check your posture, because most people, they're not paying any attention much at all to the posture of the body when they're in bed. So start to paying attention to the posture to keep bringing the body back into sleeping on the side or laying on the side. Now, whether or not your knees are bent up into the fetal position or whether they're straight out or any in between is not the issue. The really important issue is that you're sleeping on the side and that you're remembering to put the body into that posture. So you're doing two good things throughout the night. If you remember to readjust your posture, then you're going to be breathing better. But also that little bit of mindfulness to wake up and recognize that you're not in the posture that you want to be in. And so it's part of the practice of waking up, of checking your posture, If you— and as well, we're talking about that, we can also talk about the preparation for going to sleep at night. And one of those would be that a lot of people have the situation when they go to bed, they have the idea that, oh well, I've got stuff to do tomorrow and I've got to get some sleep. Right? This attitude is unwholesome. You can hear the unwholesomeness in the words that I used. A much more wholesome way of going to sleep is with the mindfulness, having the thoughts of, wow, this is nice. Got no place to go and nothing to do for 8 hours. I can just lay here and have a ball. You hear the wholesomeness in that. So we begin to have wholesome thoughts. Everything's going to be all right. I'm going to get all the rest I need. How nice this is. You can snuggle up under the covers and say, oh, this feels so good. You're not convinced.

**Speaker B:** I've been having sleeping problems for years, and I know what's causing it, but it takes time for me to get back to where I need to get to. It's a hormonal problem. I'm on, let's just say, supplemental hormones prescribed by a doctor, and things get out of whack. My sleep gets really bad, and I use the word tired, but like My patience gets really thin. I, uh, today I've been more emotional. Like, it's just, there's a lot of factors involved. Like, I feel terrible right now.

**Speaker A:** All of those factors though have to do with unwholesome thought.

**Speaker B:** Agreed.

**Speaker A:** That if, if you were having wholesome thoughts most, much more of the time, you probably wouldn't feel the way that you feel.

**Speaker B:** Agreed.

**Speaker A:** Irritable and patient. But if you were having wholesome thoughts, then wholesome thoughts, you could be patient. So this is an important point, is that the kind of statements that you're making sounds like that— trying to be careful here, I don't want to step on anybody's toes— it sounds like that you're that you're feeling kind of overwhelmed, or that you've got a lot of work to do, or that this is a big issue, things like that, which basically put us into the feeling of this is hard or this is difficult. And that is an associative attitude with that things are stronger than you are, putting us into the position of being a victim to our own. You're saying guilty?

**Speaker B:** Yes, that's what it feels like.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so you feel guilty for, or even shame for not being able to do what you think that you ought to be able to do. And so you're a victim to something. You're being victimized. Okay, this is an attitude that we can begin to change. And so while I was talking about laying in bed at night, the victim is the one who, oh, I've got to get to sleep, oh, I've got so much work to do, to where the winner's position is, wow, I've got no place to go and nothing to do for the next 8 hours. I could just lay here and just enjoy. You take a few deep breaths and just enjoy the night because I got no pressures, no worries, nothing to do. Nobody going to break into the house and put me in front of the computer screen and whack me until I type.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's true.

**Speaker A:** That is true.

**Speaker B:** That's, that's not what I'm upset though. I said that's not when I'm upset though, but I get the point. I get, I get the point you're making.

**Speaker A:** Well, you'd be surprised that even then, even when you're ready to get into bed, we still tell ourselves upsetting kinds of things, work to do and whatnot like that, rather than finally giving ourselves peace and quiet and rest. Okay, all right. And, and so, uh, then, then throughout the night, we're going to maintain that we keep getting back into this, to laying on the side. And this will take some training. It takes long training to be able to sleep on the side because the body's habit is to end the irritation, and you'll change postures with Anagami without even waking up through the night. And so people— you've probably seen high-speed film of people sleeping for hours and they're just tossing and turning and rolling all over the place. Or if you sleep with a child, a child is just all over the bed. I'm surprised that children even stay in beds. I guess that's why they put bars around beds for really young kids, right? Okay, so we're all over the place. Us unconsciously or subconsciously. And so beginning to pay attention to what posture we're in keeps bringing us back into the present moment. And you will find it in fact, basically what dreams are about in general, some people will argue that occasionally there are some dreams that are wholesome, but generally dreams themselves are unwholesome.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, dream about you last night.

**Speaker A:** Which means that if we're having unwholesome thoughts as we're going to sleep, those same old unwholesome thoughts will just continue on as we're going into sleep. But if we start intentionally as we're going to sleep to have wholesome thoughts, then there's not much to dream about. Okay, okay, that's true. So, uh, practicing Anapanasati, uh, before and during going to bed and, and while you're laying there in bed is a good time to practice. Okay, uh, that, uh, this practice doesn't have to be done sitting on the floor in meditation style the way that the Westerners have that actually we need to be able to practice in all the postures. And so now that you're mentioning that you've got sleep issues and whatnot, the right way to handle them is by beginning more and more to substitute unwholesome thoughts with wholesome thoughts and to make sure that you are gaining the benefit of removing those unwholesome thoughts and having wholesome thoughts. So let me give you a story of the Buddha. This is in Sutta 19. It's a very interesting story. He's talking about a cowherd, and the cowherd has to take the cows down a trail or down a path. And this is a trail or a path that's inhabited. And so you've got stalls and you've got people and you've got kids and all kinds of stuff. So while the cowherd is taking his cows down this path, he has to use a stick to whack the cow to keep the cow on the path, because the cows will just roam anywhere and they can step on a child or bust into a food stall or take food off the stall, any kind of things. And so the goat the cowherd, has to be very mindful. But the issue is not that he has to hit them with a stick to get them to go, but rather that he knows that if he doesn't hit them with the stick, that they can go off and do something that's damaging or dangerous. That if his cow steps on a child, then the authorities are going to come in. Or if one of his cows knocks over a food stall, he's going to have to pay for that. And if it's a wealthy man, he could wind up in whatever version of a hospital that this guy has, right?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And so we have to be careful to keep the cows in line. Now, this is actually the practice of the brand new beginner, the brand new beginner, because the cows are likely to go into unwholesome territory all the time and we're not even watching them. So now we're going to be watching the cows to make sure that they don't tread off the path and go astray into unwholesome thoughts causing damage. However, once we get practicing well, that's the analogy is when the cows are now out in the pasture where he's taken them on the road to a place where they've already gathered the rice and there's rice stalks and stubble out there for the cows to eat. And so now the cowherd doesn't have to stand there with his stick right there with the cows. He can go sit down under a tree, and all he has to do is to monitor, to say, yeah, there's the cows. Yeah, there they are. I can see them. Okay, and so this is actually more relaxed. So we're actually going from one relaxed state to the lower, the more relaxed, to more relaxed, to more relaxed. When we're not guarding the mind, when we're not watching where the cows are, then they're all over the place causing damage. Like having those thoughts of that conversation over and over and over again, it's not a relaxing way of living one's life, is always thinking about the past and the future. And so we begin to monitor that as often as we can remember to do it, all day long, not just in the sitting. But the sitting will help this a lot if we continue to focus on having just wholesome thoughts and we've got nothing else to distract us, then we can practice better. This is the reason for of the secluded practice is to get into the habit of having wholesome thoughts, more wholesome thoughts, and more wholesome thoughts. But then we need to monitor that all the time. And when we get to the point where we have wholesome thoughts all the time, then it's not so much work at all. So the most work is not monitoring the mind, and then we begin to monitor the mind, but then we recognize that that's a lot of work too, to throw out unwholesome thoughts and keep throwing them out. But eventually we get down to the point to where it's all wholesome thoughts. And now that they're all wholesome thoughts, the cowherd can sit under the tree and rest. But there's even more than that, and that is that once we recognize that all of our thoughts are wholesome, now we don't even need to have so many of them. We can begin to put some space between the thoughts, so that there's a wholesome thought and then silence.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Then another wholesome thought and then silence. And pretty soon we have a lot of silence and a whole lot fewer wholesome thoughts. But unwholesome thoughts, once the unwholesome thought comes in, it's very difficult to bring the silence back, that the silence has to be done through the wholesome, not through the unwholesome. And so this is the way that we practice for the Anapanasati, is to continue to bring back wholesome thoughts, and we have to do an investigation to figure out what's wholesome and what's not wholesome. So the easy way to do it is to recognize that if this thought is pleasant, pleasing, and happening right here, right now, that this is what's happening right here, right now, then that more than likely is going to be a wholesome thought. If it's a hindrance, would be wanting something that we don't have. Having to put up with an irritation that we have, wondering about the practice— is this the right way to practice?— would be doubt. Restlessness and worry would be about the past and the future, what's happening in the past, what's happening in the future. So any past or future thoughts we can say would be automatically unwholesome. As opposed to the wholesome thoughts of being happening right now. Okay, there's also the possibility that talking about the Dhamma, talking about the Buddha-Dharma, is also very wholesome. That if you're sitting and thinking about the Dhamma, that's much more wholesome than thinking the thoughts. So let us say that we had a thought about That guy did me wrong and I've got to go straighten this out there. Okay, and if we let those thoughts go on, that's an unwholesome thought. But a wholesome thought would come along with saying, hey, I don't have to do that right now, but that is Dukkha. The cause of the Dukkha is because I wanted something from him that I didn't get, and now I still want something from him. Okay, so we can see the hindrances in there, and this is now wholesome thinking. The wholesome thinking is to see the danger in the unwholesome, right? Okay, so this is one of the ways of thinking also that is wholesome, is, wow, I don't have to do that. Wow, I don't have to go there. I can avoid that place. And We can all— yeah, and we can also, when we do, we can congratulate ourselves. Wow, I didn't have to think about Billy Bob. I don't have to think about him right now, right? I don't have to work myself up.

**Speaker B:** And then if you eventually do need to deal with it, you can respond appropriately.

**Speaker A:** Why? Because we haven't all this backed up stuff. In fact, If we've got a plan when we go to meet him, we may not be willing to listen to anything he has to say because look at all of this stuff I've got material prepared to dump on him.

**Speaker B:** Right, we build a story.

**Speaker A:** I build a story, right. Well, if we stop building that story, then when we see him, he may have forgotten about the argument. He may be really glad to see you. Why are you going to go stir it back up again?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that would be ideal.

**Speaker A:** Uh, it's doable, I believe, but it takes memory. It takes Sati. We have to remember to do this little investigation. That investigation is, is wholesome, is it not wholesome? That's the noting technique, is we note. Not this is it, but we note. Is this Dukkha? We note. Is this wholesome? We note. Is this a hindrance?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And if it is a hindrance, if it is that, then we can— uh, the way that the Buddha himself handled it was, aha, I see you, Mara. Right. Okay, and that's a completely new thought. That's the Dhamma thought. That's a wholesome thought. Dukkha, dukkha, dukkha. Oh, I've got so much dukkha. That's one kind of unwholesome thought. But then you say, aha, I see you, dukkha. I gotcha. And now we're beginning also to change the attitude, right? This is one's right effort. One's right effort is to see wrong view as wrong view and change it to right view. And then one's right effort is to change the thoughts that are associated with wrong view and to bring them into wholesome thoughts. That's basically one's right effort. Also, one's right effort is to breathe, to take those long deep breaths, mindfully breathing in long and mindfully breathing out long, while we are saying, "Hey, I don't have to think about that." Like, "I see you, Mara." So you can see the Anapanasati in there, taking that deep breath. In fact, almost always an insight will come with an in-breath. That in fact, when I'm going down the road, I'm sitting there and Pam's driving and she'll say, "What?" just because I saw something. And when I saw something, I'll breathe in and she can hear it. You've heard that how many billions of times, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so that in-breath, noticing that in-breath to be associated with the, uh, with the insight of I see you, Mara, or I don't have to think about that. Yeah. And so we take that long, deep in-breath, and then we sigh and let it out. I'm glad I don't have to do that. So you could think of it like this, is that that cowherd then whacking that cow with the stick is actually the taking of the in-breath. And then having the cow move out of the way so that it doesn't step on that child or doesn't run into that food cart is a relief. Wow, what a relief it is we didn't go there. And that's the out-breath, that relief, that relaxation. And so start practicing with the breath. With the sense of letting go, relaxation, relinquishment with that out-breath. This is different than what they call in Western Buddhism acceptance. I don't even know where that term came from. It's like You've heard the story of the lion that got a thorn in his paw, and I think it was a monkey or a rat or something. No, the rat chewed the ropes to get the lion free. The monkey took a thorn to pull the other thorn out. So the question would be, if the lion has a thorn in his paw, should he accept that?

**Speaker B:** Depends on if he has any power to change it.

**Speaker A:** Uh, yeah, I would imagine that, um, the, the lion would have the same power to change it that the dogs would have, because I see the dogs around here chewing on their paws relentlessly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, yes, the If we make the assumption that he could, then no, he doesn't have to accept that.

**Speaker A:** Right, he doesn't have to accept it. And that therein lies in that story also the technique of taking a little action in order to prevent large action. When the Buddha is teaching about the four kinds of Kamma, not just two, but four. In the last kind of Kamma, he says that this is the Kamma that leads to the end of Kamma. And that sounds confusing, doesn't it? The action that leads to the end of action. Well, here's an easy example of that, is that you've got an entire freeway, let us say rush hour, high-speed traffic, everything is flowing, going. And all the cops have to do is just to park a couple of cars sideways on the highway, and he can stop the entire traffic. All of those hundreds, thousands of people have to come to a stop, just because the cops put two cars out there on the road. So that's an example of an action that will bring the end of action. Okay, and so in this regard, the action that brings in the end of the action is to wake up and to recognize that these thoughts are unwholesome, and then to change them into wholesome is a small action as compared to having unwholesome thoughts one after the other for hours, days, weeks, giving yourself insomnia. Being tired, being restless, being worried, no patience, all of that kind of stuff is then all of that traffic that's out there that we can put a stop to with a small little action. That little action that we take is just to gladden the mind, to say, "Hey, I don't have to think about that right now," or use the term the Buddha did, "Aha!" I see you, I see you, Mara. Because in fact, what will happen with most students in the beginning especially, it happens is that when they do have some Sati, they do wake up and recognize that the mind has, for instance, wandered away from the breath, they will continue to have unwholesome thoughts like, "Oh no, this meditation is so hard. Monkey mind, monkey mind. Oh, this is so tough. I don't think I'm ever going to get there." I'm not going to get any value out of this meditation, right? These are the kinds of thoughts that people have.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, mine have been, um, I'm not sure if this is wholesome, I'm not sure if it's not, it seems okay but I'm not sure. And there's— I'm glad you're explaining it because it's making more sense to me.

**Speaker A:** Okay, good. Um, in fact, is this wholesome or is this not wholesome? This confusion That's unwholesome. That's doubt.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. But always thoughts of this present moment are wholesome. Also, thoughts about the Dharma in this present moment are wholesome. Like looking at that unwholesome thought and saying, aha, I see you, that's Dukkha. That's the first noble truth. What's the cause of Dukkha is the fact that while I was having those unwholesome thoughts, I wasn't aware of them. There's the ignorance, and those unwholesome thoughts also have wants and desires in them. And so I can see immediately that's the cause of this suffering is because I want something I don't have. And so we can say, wait a minute, I'm okay with what I do have right now. I'm satisfied. I'm all right. We take a deep breath and we immediately fall out of the second and the first noble truth into the third noble truth, perhaps with the idea or with the thought of, wow, this is nice. Or we can go even to the point of, wow, this is third noble truth. Wow, this is really nice, no suffering right now. Okay, and so then we can, with our right investigation, we can investigate like the Eightfold Noble Path, the points that we're on about. And that is, is that how is my investigation? Am I able to investigate? How is my Sati? Do I keep waking up? Do I practice, keep waking up? How is it? How is it going? How is it progressing? How is my right effort? Am I taking the effort to throw unwholesome thoughts out when I catch them? Do I have the right effort to take a deep breath whenever I remember it? So how's my Sati? How's my effort? And then also in that investigation, how's my attitude? Am I on top of the world or am I buried under my own pile of crap? Okay, this actually leads to the story, I really like this one, a student told me this, he says, everyone is an emperor of their own pile of dirt. Yeah, except that most emperors are buried under their pile of dirt, or completely unaware of it. Right, exactly. And buried under it and completely unaware of it because they're completely surrounded by it. But the practice of Anapanasati is literally to get on top of it. So that you really are the emperor on top of the world.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And it is not a struggle to come out from under it to be on top of it. That's one's right effort. When the effort is right, we just immediately come out from under it all. That's an unwholesome thought, or aha, I see you, Mara. And that Mara used to be right on top of me, but now what is happening with that is that aha, I see you, Mara. And we're drawing ourselves out of that thought. Before, we were in it, we were that thought. But this new thought is, "Aha, I see you, Mara," is to pull us out. That brings us on top of the world. We're above the world now. We're above those negative thoughts. And so we become the emperor. We're on top of it now. This is Lokottara, or the supramundane. Is to pull out of it and get above it.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And you can do that. I believe you.

**Speaker B:** I do it. I just don't do it all the time.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, just get more practice and do it more often. Exactly. That's the way to practice, is that as many times as often as you can. In fact, this is why Sati is the most important skill. Why? Because if you don't remember to do this, you're not going to do it. It doesn't matter what skill you have. If you don't remember to apply that skill, then okay, it's like someone— let's use the example of tennis, and someone is training in tennis and their teacher is teaching them a new shot, perhaps the backhand or something like that, and they practice and they practice it. And, and, and good. And now they have a game, and just at this right point in time, that ball is way over there on the left side, and it's time to go out there and do that backhand, right? Can't do it. Why? Because he forgets. Even though he's got the skill, he forgets to apply the skill. Okay, that's why Sati is so valuable. Is because we have to remember to wake up to begin to apply the skills that we have. And by waking up and remembering to apply the skill, then now we're building two skills. One is the skill, and two is to remember to apply the skill. So this is where Sati comes first. If we can remember to look at what we're doing, to remember to wake up and take a look Is this thought wholesome? Is this thought not wholesome? Is this thought about the past? Because if this thought is wholesome, what that means is that it's free from hindrances. It's an easy thought, it's easygoing, everything is all right, no worries, no troubles. But you've been troubling yourself for quite a long time.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And so it's a habit, but you can interrupt that habit over and over and over again. And so the unwholesome thought will come, memory will come, then we change it to a wholesome attitude, change it to a wholesome thought, take a deep breath, and a minute later we're back into those unwholesome thoughts again. Well, never mind, we did it one time. If I can— now here's the point: would it have been better for me to have been in hindrance, stayed in hindrance, not ever taken a deep breath, and remain in hindrance? So now that we're in hindrance for 5 minutes versus being in hindrance for, say, 30 minutes or a minute, waking up, being out of hindrance for 4 minutes, and then forgetting and dropping back into hindrance. So which is better, 2 minutes of hindrance or 5 minutes of hindrance?

**Speaker B:** Well, obviously the less.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, exactly. Every time that we wake up is less hindrance. Every time we wake up and apply it, we're developing the skill so that the next time we spend even less time in hindrance. So that pretty soon we get it to as soon as those unwholesome thoughts start to arise, we could catch them. Gotcha! And eventually it'll get to the point that you can just sit there with one wholesome thought after another after another, and it's easy peasy. Now there's no effort to it much because they're all wholesome thoughts, and I don't have to take the effort to throw it out. Just one wholesome thought after another after another. And so we begin to practice this, to practice telling yourself, or to practice to have intentionally the thoughts that you want to have. And so there's a whole vocabulary of nurturing wholesome thoughts that you could have. I just got a bunch of them,

**Speaker B:** but I got— I'm good on that. I mean, yeah. I'm good on that because I've had a lot of experience in the last year and a half with being extremely happy, um, and being extremely grateful. And like, gratitude is probably my go-to. I like gratitude a lot.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, uh, you can hear the gratitude in the expression of, wow, this is so nice. Yeah, they're just that's loaded down with gratitude. It's like, oh, thank you so much. Thank you for coming out of those unwholesome thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Do you have a problem with me being like, well, is this unwholesome for me to say, thank God for this? Like, not that I said God, but like, thank you, universe, for what is happening right now.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. All right, uh, do you know the, uh, the phrase TGIF?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, thank God it's Friday, right?

**Speaker A:** Okay, right. Well, every day is Friday.

**Speaker B:** All right, fair enough. I'm getting it.

**Speaker A:** Okay, um, you could also say it this way, that every day is a holiday.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, everything is beautiful. Everything is perfect.

**Speaker A:** There was an old song out of a 1950s movie of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, and I don't remember the movie's name, but they sang a song in there that I changed when I was a child. I changed the verbiage. And so when I've got internet access, I'm trying to get the lyrics that I remember instead of the actual lyrics, and I couldn't find a song, but I eventually did. The original lyrics to the song that they were singing was, every street's a boulevard in old New York. But I would sing it differently. I would sing it, every day's a holiday. And so that's the way we— it's a new attitude about life. Every day is a holiday. Everything's going to be all right, right? These are the kind of nurturing thoughts, like today is a holiday, TGIF, thank God today's Friday, and it's Friday afternoon to boot.

**Speaker B:** That's true, today is going to be Friday.

**Speaker A:** Come to think of it, it really is Friday, isn't it? Yeah, it's Yeah, because Kitty didn't go to school this morning.

**Speaker B:** It'll be Friday here in, uh, 20 minutes. So there's a 12-hour time difference between me and you. So it's, it's 11:37 AM there, right?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so it's 11:37 PM here.

**Speaker A:** And it's about to be Saturday.

**Speaker B:** It's about to be Friday.

**Speaker A:** If we're about to be Friday and it's already noon— oh, wait a minute. Okay, it is Friday. All right, sorry about that. Kitty didn't go to school today and I figured that it was Saturday and it's Friday. Never mind, it's a holiday.

**Speaker B:** But yeah, about to say your analogy worked. So it's perfectly appropriate.

**Speaker A:** So this is the way then we begin to practice all the time, whether you're laying in bed, whether you're driving the car, whether you're sitting in meditation. But we want to practice in meditation because the seclusion part is so valuable in the sense of getting away from all sensory input altogether. So that we only have to deal with the unwholesome thoughts rather than new unwholesome stuff coming in all the time.

**Speaker B:** So you're not necessarily talking about sitting on a cushion, you're just talking about a focused practice in seclusion?

**Speaker A:** In seclusion, right. Getting away from it all, literally. And I don't care what posture you're in. Yeah, okay. But if you had no furniture at all in your house house, how would you sit? If you didn't have that chair and the couch and the bed and any of that furniture and that was an absolutely bare, empty room, how would you sit?

**Speaker B:** Probably wouldn't sit. Probably lay down. I don't know, it depends on how long I'm sitting. I've noticed I've been to some retreats and stuff where if I sit for too long, it really starts to hurt.

**Speaker A:** Well, here's the point about that. Here in Asia and in tropical places, in my lifetime here in Thailand, furniture is not the issue that it is in— you probably got more furniture in your room right there than we have in the entire house.

**Speaker B:** Wow. Okay.

**Speaker A:** And the Thai people, when they eat, they don't eat at a table. They eat on the floor. Why? Because the whole middle of the floor is enough room to where you spread food out all over the place and people sit around it. And because, um, in the West, I think it has to do with temperature and coldness because every 2-year-old child is grabbed up off the floor and put into a high chair. I have never seen a chair, a high chair, in Thailand, right? They don't exist. Not only that, but the babies and young children sleep in the same bed with the parents. Piti is 8 years old. She still sleeps with us.

**Speaker B:** Wow.

**Speaker A:** Wow, that's the Thai system. So, uh, the story then is of my stepdaughter. I first met her when she was 11, and she's about 18 or 19 now, finished. She's in university, and she sits when she eats in the full lotus position. The full lotus posture is how she eats.

**Speaker B:** Wow.

**Speaker A:** And all of these Western Asians are lusting after this posture that this girl and all these Asian people in is just a natural posture for them because they've been doing it their whole lives, right? But in the West, we've been trained to, uh, to sit in on chairs and on furniture. Now, this is so, um, uh, let us say pervasive in Western mentality that Bhikkhu Bodhi and the other translators of the suttas— I could, I could go look up the word, it wouldn't take much— is that the word they translated into cross-legged. In that very famous part where the Buddha says, go to a heap of straw or to the forest or to an empty hut or to a tree and sit down cross-legged cross-legged and bring the mindfulness to the fore, right? That's the standard thing that they say. Guess what? That word does not translate into cross-legged. There is no way you can get cross-legged out of that word in Pali. What is it? It actually will easily translate to the word couch or divan or chair or sitting appliance. It literally just means sitting, and it's the Western mentality that meditation has to be done cross-legged.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I've always had a problem with that, the posture, because everyone harps about it, like you got to sit like this. I'm like, what does that have to do with my mind?

**Speaker A:** Well, it has to do with it in the sense that if your posture If you're not sitting up straight, then imagine it's like this. You can see the hand and the gravity is pulling the hand straight down. But if you have the hand like this, imagine that you had a very heavy weight like a head or a brain or something up here at the top, and the posture is bent over. That's going to cause extra strain in the back. And we're remembering, looking for ease, right? And so sitting up straight is the easy way to sit, sitting— if you don't have any chairs or furniture to sit on, right? Right. So sitting up straight is more— especially if you're going to be there for a while. And I know a lot of monks who will have a very, very low table so that they can bring the low table and they can sit on the floor in their cross-legged position so that they can type on their laptop.

**Speaker B:** Nice.

**Speaker A:** Very typical of the monks, right? Tanisro, at least he's got a chair and a desk. So don't put so much into the actual posture, but we take it in the sense of, number one, It needs to be stable. Number 2, it needs to be comfortable. Because we're looking for comfort, we're looking for ease. The entire teaching of the Buddha is to come out of discomfort and dis-ease into a state of comfort and ease. And so we want to use the posture in that regard also.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** But we don't have to do it just at a particular time of day. A lot of students think that my meditation is all my meditation is from, you know, 1 hour a day. And the answer to that is, oh, that means that now you've been practicing hindrances and unwholesome thoughts for 15, 20 years, 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, and now you're going to take 1 day, 1 hour a day to practice having wholesome, leaving the other 23 hours a day with unwholesome hindering thoughts? Which one's going to win out of that?

**Speaker B:** Um, well, the one that doesn't have the unwholesome thoughts. Like, that's a no-brainer.

**Speaker A:** It's a— that's a no-brainer when you think of it like that. That means that it any occasion, whatever the mind is doing, we should keep track that it's not going to go off and step on something or break something or get stuck in the mud something in some stupid conversation. And so we want to take that right effort and right Sati to wake up, to monitor to see what the mind is doing. And then if there's an unwholesome, to bring it back to the wholesome.

**Speaker B:** I can meditate. That was one of the reasons why I contacted you. I was hoping you would make me meditate. So

**Speaker A:** you didn't realize you'd be giving you that much meditation.

**Speaker B:** So you're saying an hour a day? If we— I mean, obviously— No, I

**Speaker A:** would actually rather see people practice in a different way rather than an hour a day. That in fact the hour-a-day howl idea comes from the fact that many people, their mind won't settle down for the first 45 minutes. And so they spend 45 minutes working and struggling trying to get rid of the hindrances and don't. And then finally the mind gets tired and stops with it all, and then they think that that's meditation, where in fact the mind's just is really tired. That you've probably heard many times in many places that the human mind in general has about a 20-minute attention span. And if we can really, really focus, we can do for an hour. And only really good experts can do it for 2 or 3 hours.

**Speaker B:** Yep, that's why the college to help me study, right?

**Speaker A:** So knowing that the attention span is short For the beginners, it's really a good idea for the students, instead of having one long sitting practice for an hour, is to break it up into 4 groups of 15 minutes each and do it 15 minutes at a time. 15 minutes in the morning, 15 minutes at lunch, 15 minutes when you come home, and then 15 minutes as you're going to bed would be a much, much better practice than taking a whole hour out and not getting as much, let us say, mind moments of wholesome, that you will have a whole lot more mind moments of wholesome in 4 sessions of 15 minutes than you will have of one session that lasts an hour. All right, because why? For one thing, the mind is fresh every time that you sit down for that 15-minute session. The mind will be fresh enough that you can actually practice for that first 15 minutes. Because you don't have to let the mind settle down, you're settling it down. Right. Right, why? Because you're not just noting unwholesome thoughts as they begin to settle, you're beginning to watch an unwholesome thought, out you go, you're gone. Only wholesome thoughts here, boy. Okay. Now when we're having these wholesome thoughts, we begin to feel wholesome also. This is the later practice that you and I will talk about later, but the first part is to get us in line to where we know that the wholesome thoughts are the way to go. But basically what I'm getting at is that we have been spending our many lives, our many many years practicing unwholesome, or basically talking ourselves into feeling bad. Now it's time to talk ourselves into feeling good. This is what we're going for, is it not just the talking to ourselves with wholesome thoughts, but we're going to talk ourselves into actually feeling good. To feel secure, to feel safe, to feel some comfortable, to feel like everything really is all right. And we become satisfied. And so next time when you call, we'll talk about this point about satisfaction, to get ourselves into a state of satisfaction so that we're comfortable and happy with and satisfied with what's happening in our own minds in this present moment. If you can get yourself into that state of satisfaction in your own mind, then we can go out into the world and deal with the world from a base of satisfaction. That's where that acceptance finally comes into play. If we say, oh, well, I've got to just accept the unwholesome thoughts in my mind, I'll never be able to get it to the point of being able to accept things in general. It's only by having wholesome thoughts. It's only wholesome thoughts can be accepted. Unwholesome thoughts are going to still be rejecting error. How many times we've told, been told, and tell ourselves we should accept it, we still don't like it because of being wholesome.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** So this is the way to practice, is that as you practice wholesome thoughts, you'll get yourself into a state of feeling very good. The word in Pali is called Sukkha, which is exactly the opposite of Dukkha. Dukkha is unsatisfactory, unwholesome, and Sukkha means everything is okay, everything is fine, no worries, no problems. No pain, nothing to do, no place to go, and the spring comes and the grass grows by itself. So we need to cultivate moments like that, to continue to cultivate moments where everything really is all right. Because as we cultivate those moments where we have the thoughts of everything is all right, we actually you begin to feel like everything is all right, and that's where we're really making progress,

**Speaker B:** right?

**Speaker A:** All right, well, let's finish this call now. Uh, do you have any questions or anything?

**Speaker B:** No, I'll practice.

**Speaker A:** All right, I'll get back with you. Okay, practice. Exactly right, practice. That's the way to talk about it. Practice to remember, to practice to take right effort.

**Speaker B:** Right. Yeah, I will, I will practice.

**Speaker A:** Excellent, David.

**Speaker B:** So thank you for your time. I appreciate it.

**Speaker A:** I hope that we've given you just enough of spark of imagination and whatnot that you can go get her done.

**Speaker B:** I'm not worried about getting it done, but that's not the problem. Um, but I will— I see where you're going.

**Speaker A:** I know, I— it's a— that was a joke or a play on words. Get her done here means stop doing anything, and now you've got her done.

**Speaker B:** I didn't expect that from you. That's I got you. That's clever.

**Speaker A:** David, it's good to see you again. I'm really glad that you're getting something out of this.

**Speaker B:** Well, yeah, it's important to me. I've had a radical shift in my— and how I feel most of the time. And really, the only time when it's not like that is when I'm like this. And the way I view it is the universe is giving me suffering so that I can get further along in my practice.

**Speaker A:** No, no, the universe cares not a whit about you. The universe is way too busy making sure that the cause-effect relationships keep rolling on. That's the job of the universe, is to make sure that causes actually create effects. Effects. That's its only job.

**Speaker B:** Well, that would seem to imply that there's not a benevolence to reality.

**Speaker A:** Well, yes, there is, but you've got to add that. It's up to you, not the universe. The universe has already given you all the benevolence it's going to give you. What is that? It created you. Here you are. You're part of the universe. You're in You're on the inside. You're an insider to the universe. Okay, but everybody keeps feeling like that they're an outsider for some reason. And yet here you are. You're welcome. The universe has invited you in. Here you are. What else do you want from the universe?

**Speaker B:** I guess nothing. What you're saying is completely contrary to what I believe. So it may take me some time to accept that.

**Speaker A:** Well, you don't see your beliefs don't matter.

**Speaker B:** Okay, it's contrary to my experience.

**Speaker A:** Well, contrary to my experience that everything is fine. Pardon? Go ahead. I missed you.

**Speaker B:** I said it's contrary to my experience that everything is fine. Like, I don't— well, I guess you would call it magical thinking to feel like, though I don't understand it, that there's purpose here to whatever the hell this is.

**Speaker A:** And

**Speaker B:** I guess I would call it faith. I have faith in whatever the hell this is. Whatever.

**Speaker A:** F-A-T-E or F-I-T-H? F-A-T-E.

**Speaker B:** No, sorry. F-A-I-T-H. Faith.

**Speaker A:** Faith.

**Speaker B:** Faith. Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** I have faith in what is. That whatever the hell I'm going through, it's supposed to be that way.

**Speaker A:** I don't know about the supposed to be's. That sounds like rights, rules, and rituals. A better way of thinking about it is that's just how it is, not how it's supposed to be. How it's supposed to be is the way people want it to be, as opposed to how it just is.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And that then would be back to that word that you used about acceptance, to accept that this is just how things are. This is it. You don't need any faith. You can see directly this is it. Okay, but people don't like it the way that it is. They want it better. They want to improve it. That means that they're dissatisfied with the way things are.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because there's a threat of evolving into something different, which is desiring change.

**Speaker A:** Desire. Exactly. This is not good enough. I want it better than this.

**Speaker B:** That's a tricky one because that goes so deep.

**Speaker A:** Like, well, yes, and you can see also that that's a hindrance— wanting things to be better than they are, wanting the world to improve, right? So the Democrats want the Republicans out, and the Republicans want the Democrats out, and everybody's unhappy. Yeah,

**Speaker B:** um, I'll— I'm gonna end up mulling over that one, but let me process and then we'll talk about it again.

**Speaker A:** All right, you can do that.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I will call you again. I— like I told you before, I'm in this now.

**Speaker A:** So great. So you do at least get to the point that wholesome is better than unwholesome.

**Speaker B:** Oh, of course, yes.

**Speaker A:** And that wholesome also has the quality of being satisfied with the way things are. Satisfaction. And unwholesome means things aren't good enough and I want to improve it. I want to make the world a better place. It ain't good enough.

**Speaker B:** I mean, you just described me in a nutshell. The world is full of injustice and I should fix that.

**Speaker A:** Guess what? The world is not full of injustice as one's own mind is full of injustice. That's the world you live in.

**Speaker B:** Probably.

**Speaker A:** So begin to see that those thoughts are unwholesome. That the world is an unjust place and it needs justice. No, it's not. The world is just as just as it's always been. There are some people who can see what's going on in there and people who don't. Which group are you going to be in?

**Speaker B:** Well, it's not not Well, it's tricky. I have a knowing that everything is fine all the time.

**Speaker A:** Tap into that. Everything really is fine. Tap into that.

**Speaker B:** But everything in my mind is like, no, can't. So, but this will help me with that. So I appreciate it. Um, I will practice and I will probably suffer about what you just told me, but I'll figure it out.

**Speaker A:** Either way, give me a call in a couple of days or next week or whenever you're ready, and we'll continue on with this.

**Speaker B:** All right, that sounds fair. Thank you very much.

**Speaker A:** I really like this conversation, Dave. This is good.

**Speaker B:** I'm glad. Glad you're enjoying it. So, but I'm going to let you go. I got it. It's midnight. Yeah. Thank you. Bless you.

**Speaker A:** We'll see you later. Bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a student named David (Speaker B), focuses on correcting a common misunderstanding in meditation practice and outlining a practical path for cultivating a wholesome mind. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Teaching: Correcting "Acceptance"**
*   **The Mistake:** A common Western error is to think we must "accept" our internal unwholesome thoughts (anger, worry, rumination).
*   **The Correction:** True acceptance is for the **external world** (which we cannot control). Our "right effort" must be applied **internally**: to recognize and **replace** unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones. Only with a wholesome mind can we truly accept external events without suffering.

### **The Practice: Noting vs. Noticing**
*   The goal isn't passive, repetitive "noting" of thoughts. It is **"noting it well and letting it pass"**—actively recognizing an unwholesome thought and then **releasing it** to change the mind's state.
*   The moment you recognize "this is an unwholesome thought," you have already created a new, separate thought and are no longer fully identified with the hindrance.

### **The Payoff: Relief (The Five Analogies)**
The Buddha used five analogies for the relief of abandoning hindrances (like ill-will, restlessness, doubt). All illustrate the profound **relief** of letting go of burdensome thoughts:
1.  **Healing from sickness** and leaving the hospital.
2.  **Being pardoned** and released from prison.
3.  **Being freed** from lifelong servitude.
4.  **Paying off** a crushing debt.
5.  **Finally setting down** heavy baggage after a long journey.
The practice leads to this tangible feeling of release and relief.

### **Practical Techniques**
1.  **Catch & Replace:** When an unwholesome thought (often about past/future) arises, recognize it (e.g., "Aha, I see you, Mara!"). Then deliberately **replace it with a wholesome thought** about the present moment (e.g., gratitude, "Everything is okay right now," "I am safe in this moment").
2.  **Use the Breath:** Pair this with a conscious, deep breath. The in-breath can be the "aha!" moment of insight, and the out-breath is the sigh of relief and letting go.
3.  **Cultivate Wholesome Vocabulary:** Nurture phrases like "Thank you," "This is nice," "Everything is perfect," "TGIF—every day is a holiday." This builds a new habit.
4.  **Practice in All Postures:** Formal meditation is important, but practice **all day**. The mind should be monitored and guided toward wholesomeness whether sitting, lying down, or walking.
5.  **Short, Frequent Sittings:** For beginners, four 15-minute sessions spread through the day are more effective than one struggling 60-minute session, as the mind is fresher and more trainable.

### **Addressing Specific Challenges (Sleep & Fatigue)**
*   **Sleep Posture:** To improve sleep quality and oxygenation, train yourself to sleep on your side, not your back or stomach.
*   **Bedtime Attitude:** Replace the unwholesome, pressured thought ("I *have to* get to sleep") with a wholesome, relieved one ("I have nowhere to be, nothing to do; I can just rest").
*   **The "Tired" Trigger:** Use the word or feeling of "tiredness" as a trigger to take a deep, mindful breath to oxygenate the body and shift state.
*   **Root Cause:** While physiological issues exist, emotional suffering is amplified by **unwholesome thoughts**. Cultivating wholesomeness increases patience and resilience even when biological factors are suboptimal.

### **The Bigger Picture: From Victim to Emperor**
*   The unwholesome mindset is one of being a **victim**—overwhelmed, guilty, and struggling against things.
*   The practice of replacing thoughts is the "small action" that stops the "traffic" of suffering. Each time you do it, you spend less time in hindrance.
*   The goal is to become the **emperor on top of your world** (Lokottara—supramundane), looking down on hindrances from a place of clarity and ease, not buried under them.

### **Final Philosophical Point**
The conversation ends with a gentle challenge to David's worldview. Dhammarato suggests:
*   The universe isn't purposefully giving you suffering for growth; it's impersonal cause and effect.
*   **Faith** is better directed not at a narrative of "this is supposed to happen," but at the direct experience that **"this is how it is right now."**
*   The deep-seated desire to "fix the world's injustice" is itself a form of dissatisfaction (a hindrance). True change starts by creating justice, peace, and wholesomeness **within your own mind**. When your mind is wholesome, you see the world differently.

**In essence:** The talk is a pragmatic guide to **active mental hygiene**. Suffering is not accepted; it is **displaced** through the continual, mindful substitution of unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones, leading to relief, ease, and a profound shift in one's lived experience.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors, analogies, and stories** to explain the process of replacing unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones and the relief that comes with it. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **1. The Backpack / Baggage Metaphor**
- **Usage:** Carrying around unwholesome thoughts is compared to carrying a heavy backpack or luggage on a journey.
- **Purpose:** To illustrate the **relief** that comes from setting down the burden of unwholesome thinking.

### **2. The Five Analogies for the Five Hindrances**
The speaker references a set of five analogies from the Buddha’s teachings (regarding the five hindrances) that all share the theme of **relief from a burden**:

1. **Being Sick in the Hospital**  
   - When you’re sick, you want to be in the hospital; when you’re better, you want to leave.  
   - Similarly, hindrances make us “sick,” and freedom from them is like being healed and released.

2. **Being in Prison**  
   - A prisoner serving a long sentence suddenly receives amnesty and is set free.  
   - Letting go of hindrances brings a similar feeling of liberation.

3. **Being a Servant to a King**  
   - A servant must attend to the king’s every need from dawn until late at night.  
   - Being released from that duty brings immense relief — like being freed from the tyranny of unwholesome thoughts.

4. **Being in Debt**  
   - The relief of finally paying off a debt.  
   - Letting go of hindrances is like clearing a mental debt.

5. **Traveling with Baggage**  
   - Similar to the backpack metaphor — arriving home and finally setting down your bags.  
   - Unpacking can wait; the relief is in putting the burden down.

**Key point:** All five analogies emphasize **release, relief, and freedom** — not just “acceptance” of suffering.

---

### **3. The Cowherd Story (from Sutta 19)**
- **Story:** A cowherd must use a stick to keep cows from straying off the path and causing damage (stepping on a child, knocking over a stall).  
- **Meaning for beginners:** We must vigilantly guard the mind (the cows are thoughts) to prevent unwholesome thoughts from causing harm.  
- **Later stage:** When the cows are in a safe pasture, the cowherd can sit under a tree and simply watch them — illustrating how, with practice, monitoring the mind becomes effortless and relaxed.

---

### **4. The Lion with a Thorn**
- **Story:** A lion with a thorn in its paw doesn’t “accept” the thorn — it removes it (with help from another animal).  
- **Purpose:** To challenge the Western meditation notion of “acceptance” of unwholesome thoughts. Instead, we should **skillfully remove** them, not just accept them.

---

### **5. Traffic-Stopping Cops Analogy**
- **Metaphor:** Police cars parked sideways on a freeway can stop thousands of cars.  
- **Purpose:** Illustrates how a **small, skillful action** (noting an unwholesome thought and replacing it) can stop a huge flow of mental suffering — an example of “kamma that leads to the end of kamma.”

---

### **6. Emperor Buried Under Dirt**
- **Metaphor:** Everyone is an emperor of their own pile of dirt, but most are buried under it and unaware.  
- **Purpose:** The practice of mindfulness (Anapanasati) is about getting **on top** of that pile — rising above unwholesome thoughts to see clearly.

---

### **7. Tennis Player Forgetting the Backhand**
- **Analogy:** A tennis player trains a new shot but forgets to use it during a match.  
- **Purpose:** Highlights the importance of **Sati (mindfulness/remembering)** — you may have the skill to change thoughts, but if you don’t remember to apply it, it’s useless.

---

### **8. Sleeping Posture & Breath**
- **Metaphorical instruction:** Adjusting sleep posture to the side is compared to adjusting mental posture — both improve “breathing” (mental clarity and oxygen flow).  
- **Link to practice:** Physical ease supports mental ease; wholesome thoughts at bedtime lead to better sleep and fewer disturbing dreams.

---

### **9. “Thank God It’s Friday” / “Every Day’s a Holiday”**
- **Reframe:** Using phrases like “TGIF” or “every day’s a holiday” as **wholesome mental habits** to cultivate gratitude and present-moment satisfaction.

---

### **Core Teaching Through Metaphor**
The speaker consistently uses these stories to draw a contrast between:
- **Unwholesome:** Being trapped, burdened, sick, in debt, or servitude.
- **Wholesome:** Relief, freedom, health, debt-free, and mastery.

The ultimate point is that **true acceptance** comes only after replacing unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones — then you can accept the present moment as it is, from a place of ease, not resignation.
