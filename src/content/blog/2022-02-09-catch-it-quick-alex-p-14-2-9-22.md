### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, let's do it. All right, so one of the things that was noticed is that when looking at what's not here right now, because that's what we were talking about last night, started entering that conversation of what's not here And it's like in a moment it'll be seen that there's no doubt. Okay, but then as soon as that's seen, the thought, oh, maybe there is some doubt, or oh, there is some doubt, comes up. Um, out of curiosity, is that the evidence of the doubt? Or is the thought, oh, there is some doubt, or oh, maybe there's some doubt, the doubt itself, and then just another one to axat, or another one to see?

**Speaker B:** Perhaps when the, let's say, the thought of seeing occurs that has the quality of, wow, there is no doubt right now, which is a statement of the child, then the conceptual mind will come in, uh, in the sense of, uh, throwing water on that first thought of, oh yes, there is doubt, or you ain't got nothing yet, or, you know, those kind of, uh, thoughts. Oh no, what can go wrong?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** All right. So those are the kind of thoughts that we have to actually be paying attention to. Basically, that's going back to clearly right in front of you, there is no problem. And yet those thoughts that there must be a problem. There must be doubts. Is that old programming? That's the parent ego state, or that's the old tapes that are coming to rain on the parade. Yeah, because things can't be that good. Yeah, you haven't worked hard enough, you don't deserve this yet. Yeah, and those are the kind of, um, underlying qualities of it. And that happens, I think, a lot in our culture, to where we don't praise our children enough for the things that they get right. That the things that they get right are, let us say, par for the course, just average. Let's stop paying attention to what we've got right, because you've got that right. Let's go pay attention now to what needs to be done that's not right. Yeah, so you can't dwell on what's good, you have to dwell on what's wrong in order to make improvements.

**Speaker A:** So the question is then, the child, or the concept, the adult concept-seeking perception that comes up and says 'Oh, there is some doubt here,' even after it's seen clearly that, 'Oh, there's no doubt here.' What is being asked here is that, 'Oh, there is doubt here,' that thought, is that— that's it— is that the doubt itself?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Meaning there is no other, other someday or some other moment doubt. The doubt is right there in that thought.

**Speaker B:** The doubt is, is this good enough?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker B:** This is not the worry about that this is not quite right yet.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's the thought that contains the doubt. It's not that the thought expresses some kind of thing somewhere within me— uh, sorry, I had to say me. Uh, I, I had to.

**Speaker B:** Um, that's been good so far.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I know. Oh shit, I did it again.

**Speaker B:** Um, you did.

**Speaker A:** I did it again. So what's being asked here is the, the doubt that is being talked about that is being asked about to you, is that doubt— is that doubt just that sentence? There's no doubt beyond that sentence is what I'm saying, is what is being said.

**Speaker B:** Okay, the answer to that is, is that that thought of But what if there is doubt?

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Is a thought of doubt that is a thought and that the wiring goes in the mind that if the parent says a doubtful word, then the child is obligated to have some feeling about it. And one of those would be the feeling of doubt.

**Speaker A:** So there is a feeling. So the feeling isn't driven from the words? I thought it is.

**Speaker B:** Can be. Can be. And the feeling can drive the words. But if the feeling drives the words or the thought, then where did the feelings come from? Something contacted us.

**Speaker A:** It had to come from the thought, right?

**Speaker B:** It had to come from the previous thought.

**Speaker A:** Previous thought.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right, right. So thought, feeling, thought, feeling, thought, feeling. And sometimes they spiral down into— yeah, all right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so the sooner that we can catch, the sooner that can be caught.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Then the less intense it is. And it takes— that's why Fast right effort is easier effort. Imagine that, let us say, in a football game, the quarterback is downfield ready for the pass. When the ball gets within his vicinity, the closer it is into his vicinity, then the more likely he's going to be able to catch the ball. And the less likely he's going to have to work very hard to catch the ball, including jumping sideways 5 feet into the air, holding his hands out, and barely is able to catch that football in a spectacular way. Okay, lots of effort. But the point is, is that if he had been standing closer to where the ball was going to land or come by, then it would have not taken so much effort. In other words, if he had seen more correctly the ball in the air and its way of heading, or its trajectory, its ballistics, mostly trajectory, then he would be in a position to catch it. So we can also do that in the sense of when these thoughts come, if we can catch that stuff quickly, then it's much easier to catch. I mean, actually grab hold of and do something about it. Yeah, but if it's— when it is thought after thought after thought, which just happens with the beginning meditator mostly, that what the skill is developing is the skill of waking up sooner and sooner and also waking up enough So these are the qualities of Sati, is waking up sooner and waking up enough. And also, once we wake up sooner, now that we've woken up, can we continue to apply that Sati over and over and over again? And so that's when we begin to build the speed of it. So the frequency, the intensity, and the speed, but frequency and speed are not the same thing. Let us say how How long does it take when you're not mindful until you are? And then when you are mindful, can you continue it on for a while? So that's a way of looking at it. So when, when these thoughts of, of seeing there's no doubt and then the thought comes, oh, but there must be, then we can say, aha, I see that thought and I can go back and reestablish that in fact there is no doubt. Doubt. And then take a sigh of relief. Really give the child credit for, wow, there's no problem, there's no doubt.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, how that plays out in the mind over here is that when, when the, the, when the object is seen clearly of worrying that there's some kind of doubt, what will the imagery that will happen is the jet stream and bring it in for a hug. And then there will be a thought, a spoken word of, oh, that's okay. Don't need to worry right now. Just come be over here. Come, come be in this joy. I'm inviting you to come enjoy this joy over here.

**Speaker B:** So basically you're setting a new set of standards.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Or you're changing the critical thoughts. Everything's a problem.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker B:** All the standards and the rules and this house is good, but that, that one's better because it's bigger. All of that kind of stuff. We could change that into a more nurturing, like, come over here and sit down, there's no problems, there's no worries.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, come enjoy this joy over here. Yeah, it's joyful over here. And I'm— and I'm— and I, I think what is being noticed here is that the, the joy is becoming more prevalent. So it's like, here's the, you know, the Dukkha or the objects that are being brought into the joy, and the joy is like bigger. It's like bigger. So it's like, you know, it kind of has a kind of gravitational pull after a while.

**Speaker B:** Yes, precisely. Or you could call it instead of gravity, could be called centripetal force.

**Speaker A:** Centripetal force.

**Speaker B:** Centripetal force. In other words, once you get things rolling, there is a force that keeps them going and it keeps them circling around some object. And that pull between the centripetal force and the gravity then is the balance. That keeps things in motion. Now let's put that back into psychological terms, and that is that we have now replaced our intention or our, let us say, expectation or our attitude as a new stance. That all of this joy then can circle around, because that's what we're building. We're changing the mind from a loser, a victim, a charlatan, one that has to play dirty in order to survive. All of this kind of stuff that happens within the mind is due to the attitude of, I was born as a little child, I was completely dependent upon my environment, and it seems that way still. But I am out of control in my environment, that the environment affects me. So that means in order for me to be able to survive, I've got to go out and affect the environment. I've got to go out and fix culture. If I could get culture fixed, then I wouldn't have any trouble. Right, right, right, right, right, right. And look at how many people give themselves how much trouble trying to fix the system.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** You've got literally millions of people sometimes dedicated hours and hours and hours a day trying to fix the system when it's their heart that's broken. So when we recognize that it's not the system that's broken, that the reason that the system is broken is because it was built by a bunch of broken hearts, and there's no changing it with a broken heart. Got to go fix the heart. We got to change that attitude of that. So basically that means is that most people have that center point and we gravitate around it as our worldview. The worldview is either Democrat-hating Republicans, or Republicans-hating Democrats, or Russians-hating Chinese, or Chinese-hating Taiwanese, or whatever it is. We've got a worldview, and when we change that worldview, We change it to a worldview of everything's all right, there's no problems, we can handle anything, there's no worries here. Okay, so that's a different worldview kind of thing, a different orbit to circle around.

**Speaker A:** Okay, another question. All right, so Okay, so noticing that whenever there's not full attention on sustaining the wholesome, and attention is dispersed elsewhere, like a meeting, a work meeting, cooking, hanging out with Abby, etc. There's either a diminishment of the wholesome, or perhaps there is a lack of attention on it, and it becomes this phenomenon where it will be noticed that I was out of it. And then after noticing, it'd be like, oh, was out of it, we'll go back into it now. It's like, it's like, I understand, not ever wanting to do anything else, because the least amount of doing allows the wholesome to be sustained more fully and enjoyably. This is something that has been noticed. Yeah, especially today.

**Speaker B:** All right, just curious if you had

**Speaker A:** anything to say about that.

**Speaker B:** Oh, a lot. Have you ever Have you ever heard the Bible verse of whatever thy hands findeth to do, do it with all thy mind, all thy strength, and all thy heart? Okay, which means put some skin in the game of what we're doing. Most people do whatever activity they're doing while their brain is scattered. Scatterbrained are actually now all circling something else, like I can't handle this, or I don't know what's going on, or I've got to prove how good I am, and all of that kind of stuff in these meetings. Okay, but there's another way of looking at it. If you are, in fact, uh, what your hands have found to do is let us say this meeting, then that means that we're going to put all of our attention into what's happening right now. And what's happening right now is a dialogue and people are talking. And so instead of thinking about what I'm going to say next, I'm actually listening to what the people are saying. That's the reality of the moment, is really go into what's happening in this present moment by being in your senses Basically not trying to make sense out of it in a way of, oh, if I can really get a handle on what they are saying, then I will know what kind of response to have to it. And off we go into a new cycle, not paying attention to the reality of what's going on. We're in our head. This actually happens with people reading a book. Or reading an article on the internet is that they start reading it because it's interesting. And about, gosh, sometimes even a paragraph in, somebody will make a statement in the book and get the reader's attention, and he'll stop and go on that while his eyes are still going down the page. But his mind is over here. And when he gets down to the bottom of the page or maybe at the end of the paragraph, he says, wait a minute, I'm not paying attention to it. We can go back to the book. Guess what? That's much more difficult to do in a meeting, especially if somebody keeps asking people to repeat over and over and over again what they just said. So it's better to learn to pay attention to what people are saying.

**Speaker A:** Gotcha.

**Speaker B:** So that's it. When you're with a girlfriend, be with girlfriend. Pay close attention. She loves that when you're really paying attention to her rather than all on your own.

**Speaker A:** Okay, what about the whole— on that,

**Speaker B:** when you are being— when you're talking and people are listening to you intently, you know it and you like it. And when people are ignoring what you're saying, you know it and you don't like it.

**Speaker A:** Sure, sure, that's fine. But this is a very new practice, and we're talking about rewiring the entire conditioning of the mind. So what's being said here, what the reason why this is thought of as important is my main— there it is— the main point to you is that whenever there's not full attention on sustaining the wholesome and attention is dispersed elsewhere, that whole experience of things being wholesome, of this, of the house of cards, you know, that being developed, Piti, the Sukkha How is it that one is to just do what they're doing while also developing the skills still?

**Speaker B:** All right, here's the issue. You use the word dispersed, which is also scattered, which actually does happen. People live a life of scatterbrain. They go off into meditation and they get some solidity. They begin to get a beat going. They begin to get a rhythm going. They begin to get into a different kind of circle rather than being scattered all over the place. And then they go back into society again, or they go back into a business meeting, or they go back to the girlfriend and they get dispersed or scattered again. Never mind. Know that. Then we come back and we practice again and get the mind back centered and in a rhythm. Get some poetry going, get some joy. At this time, when we go back, we go back with the intention of I'm not going to get scatterbrained in this, but I'm now going to take this attention that I've been focusing with on the mind to keep the mind from being scattered. I'm now going to put that on this object, which is now the girlfriend or the meeting, and I'm going to pay attention to this meeting and not get scattered. I'm not going to have random thoughts about this, that, and the other thing. I'm going to stay focused on the person that we're looking at.

**Speaker A:** Okay, totally understand that. And that sounds great. And there's even been an actual experience of that over here.

**Speaker B:** It's called Metta.

**Speaker A:** It's just that, what about the thoughts that come up, the Dukkha that comes up, and we're skillfully handling That Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Yes, we're going to go get out and coming back into the conversation and then a thought will come and we're going to do the same thing with that thought that we did when we were alone, and that is change that thought into a wholesome thought.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Okay. So we're not in a conversation with someone and that unwholesome thought comes up. Now we're going to change that thought back into paying attention to what's happening. To focus on what's going on.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so when Dukkha comes up, instead of replacing that with a wholesome thought, we're replacing that with just being here now, being here with the other person, with what's going on, the movie or whatever. And so is it safe to assume

**Speaker B:** that— And if you've got two skills, you can do that too with joy. Is to come back knowing that you're coming back, to know that you're with the person, that you're listening to what they're saying. So is it safe communing with them and becoming that joy with them? That this is the whole quality of the Metta, is that when you're with another person, really give them the attention that you would think that you would like to have.

**Speaker A:** Okay, even if one is watching TV or a movie, same thing, have that joy.

**Speaker B:** All right, here's something then. Let us say that a couple are kind of sitting side by side on the couch and on the verge but not actually cuddling. All right, and they're watching the movie. And that one then occasionally will just poke the other, just like that, just to keep letting her know that you're thinking about her enough that you're willing to nudge her every 3 or 4 minutes to bring us both back into the here and now rather than absorbed into the TV. Touch her often, once every 3 to 5 minutes if you're sitting close together.

**Speaker A:** So just wanted to be known to you that the fundamental concern here is sustaining the Piti Sukkha while being engaged in these other activities. But not practicing the skills that brought me into the Piti Sukkha while I'm engaged with them. There's a concern about that.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Okay. The concern then can be seen as now there is a new skill to be developed. And that new skill is the good old English language to pay attention. Because if you are paying attention, then your mind is not scattered. It is not having any unwholesome thoughts in it. You're paying attention to what's going on, except that occasionally you do have thoughts. And now the new thoughts that are going to be happening are the wholesome thoughts, would be, I am paying attention. Look closely. Or I'm enjoying this breath and smile, and I'm enjoying this conversation now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay, all right, great.

**Speaker B:** And starting to focus on what is happening in the present moment, because that's all we've got is this present moment. It's the only thing that we've ever going to have. And yet We continually want to live in the past or the future. So if you're having a conversation or in a meeting, have your thoughts about this conversation or this meeting or what's happening right now. If you're sitting with your girlfriend, remember that you're sitting with the girlfriend. Remind her that you're sitting with her so she'll remember that you're sitting with you.

**Speaker A:** It's just, I'm going to say, it's just there's a little bit of a hesitancy around this because this new practice is still very immature. It's very premature. It's very new.

**Speaker B:** I know. I know. I know. I've been watching you. You've been busting out of that egg really in a hurry.

**Speaker A:** And don't want to compromise it. Want to ruin it, you know, don't want to, um, go into the dictionary.

**Speaker B:** If that's the only thing you've got on your mind here, we've got a space on the floor here on the porch.

**Speaker A:** I can't come there.

**Speaker B:** All right, so that means that you do have to deal with the world.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, now that you have to know that you have to, can you go deal with the world with joy, with the attitude, I can handle this girlfriend, I can handle this meeting. And then you go in and actually do that, putting some skin in the game. Pay attention. If you could pay attention to your breath, you can pay attention to your boss.

**Speaker A:** Sure.

**Speaker B:** And if you learn to control your breath, you'll learn to control your boss too.

**Speaker A:** Sure. It's just that what I want you to know, and I'm saying I now, I'm saying I know What I want you to know is that this whole time, what's been going on is a complete dedication to this practice, no matter where I am, whether I'm by myself or with the world or whatever. But the practice is noticing the unwholesome, replacing it with wholesome. It hasn't been noticing the unwholesome and then replacing it with being here now with what is in front of me. But at the same time, it is kind of also still being here right now with what's in front of me, isn't it?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** If I'm replacing the whole— except that one thing. Now the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune that keep striking us and pounding us are not old things that happened already in the past. Now we have to go out in the world and deal with the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune that are happening right now. That are coming out of the world? Can you begin to dodge those too? Well, you can if you can see them coming. So just like the analogy of dealing with it in the mind when it comes up in the mind, that's the new skill that we practice in seclusion. But we now have to take that skill back into the world. Can we take that skill back into the world instead of jumping back into the toilet of the world and live the way that we used to live? Now we can use those skills to develop new skills of being present so that we can play a really good game of dodgeball in reality.

**Speaker A:** Why do you think that there's a readiness over here to do that?

**Speaker B:** Because you don't have a choice. For that. You've already turned down my offer to come sit on the porch.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, no, but when we first started talking, you didn't give me— you didn't tell me this. I'm saying is, why now?

**Speaker B:** Why now what?

**Speaker A:** Why now? Tell me this.

**Speaker B:** Because you are asking the question about how do I handle the world.

**Speaker A:** Not really.

**Speaker B:** Well, you're saying— you mentioned meetings, you mentioned girlfriend.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but that's not at the heart of my question. At the heart of my question is, how can I maintain all this great practice I'm doing while being in the world?

**Speaker B:** Well, the answer to that is by paying close attention to the world happily. Okay, what's happening in this present moment in your world, which could be a meeting, it could be a girlfriend, it could be a boss chewing you out.

**Speaker A:** Okay. All right.

**Speaker B:** All right. Whatever it is, be there with it joyfully, because if you can in fact get over all of the slings and arrows that wounded you in the past, you can get over this one too immediately by just stepping out of the way. Don't get hit by that arrow. Okay, which means to pay attention to what's going on right now. Then in fact, if you are paying close attention to what's going on, the likelihood of arrows and slings being thrown are less likely.

**Speaker A:** Understood, understood. Okay, another question.

**Speaker B:** All right, um, this is, by the way, one that we will have to visit over and over again. This is the, uh, one of the most important questions of the practice.

**Speaker A:** Great.

**Speaker B:** Because how do I get away from it all? Next question is, how do I really get away from it all in the mind? And then the next question is, how can I stay away from it all when I have to go back and deal with it all?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay. All right.

**Speaker A:** Um, thank you.

**Speaker B:** Over and over, we'll work on that. How you have learn how to deal with the here-now by being here-now with it. Yeah, whatever the here-now presents to you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay. Um, okay. Um, also notice that the joy, uh, This is, yeah, this is, I kind of, I don't want to spend too long on this, but I'm just curious what you have to say about it to help with this. So I, okay, going, taking the I, my, and mine, and me out of the language again now. So also notice that the joy that sparked is greater when seeing the Dukkha and axe flying back and forth into the hand or jet stream or whatever that imagery is, compared to the wholesome thought that comes after, like the, ah, great, congratulations. So the concern here is when the axe or jet stream loses its effect or becomes empty, there is fear expressed as the thought, what will be my source of joy to spark that Sati, Piti now when it's no longer what was being used before?

**Speaker B:** The answer to that is that that's an unwholesome thought.

**Speaker A:** No, that's, that's known. If that's understood, that's a wholesome thought.

**Speaker B:** Just saying it's an unwholesome thought.

**Speaker A:** I know what it's known. It's known it's an unwholesome thought. Yes.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so when that thought comes up, you can say, aha, I see you too.

**Speaker A:** Whack!

**Speaker B:** So, and take the joy that you can see.

**Speaker A:** That's normally what is done.

**Speaker B:** Okay. All right. All right. Um, this is not that nuanced. This is actually back to basics, is to recognize unwholesome thoughts as unwholesome rather than giving them the power that you've always given them, because this is the parent ego state saying, oh no, what, what if? This is the what-if or whataboutism.

**Speaker A:** It's what, what's being talked about specifically here is that joy, that enjoyment that comes from the imagery, that enjoyment that comes from seeing the unwholesome. If that enjoyment runs out of juice or it becomes that emptiness— wait a

**Speaker B:** minute, wait a minute, wait a minute— it runs out? Where did it come from in the first place?

**Speaker A:** Came from within.

**Speaker B:** Well, be more specific.

**Speaker A:** It came from an insistence of cultivating joy, enjoyment.

**Speaker B:** What is the cultivation then? Literally, you talked yourself into feeling good, and now you're talking yourself into feeling out of it again by saying, well, what if the technique that I'm using is not going to bring the joy. That's the statement. The 'what if'—

**Speaker A:** No, no, no, no,

**Speaker B:** it's not the joy.

**Speaker A:** No, it's not that 'what if' that doesn't bring the joy. It's 'what if' it's not enjoyable. It's 'what if' the practice becomes unenjoyable.

**Speaker B:** All right, can you see that as an unwholesome thought?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Can you see— aha, I see that as an unwholesome thought. What if the practice becomes unenjoyable? Aha, I see that. Yeah, yeah, there's the joy. Okay, all right, that's the joy that comes back. See, what you're doing is you're talking yourself out of feeling good with those thoughts. Okay, and so all you have to do is say, I see that thought too, because we've already now identified that that's an unwholesome thought, and you can replace it with the wholesome thought. Ah, I see that one too. Uh-huh, I caught you. You're not going to pull me out of this tree.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And correct me if this is wrong, but how that appears to me is that like the joy that has been cultivated is like the anchor now. So when we see the unwholesome thought, it's like, it's kind of easier to see the unwholesome thought because the anchor is joy. There's something to compare it to.

**Speaker B:** That is, in other words, you're in a different frame of reference, or you're in a different circle, or you're— yeah, okay,

**Speaker A:** okay. Now this is something that's interesting. I only— this is only experienced today. So noticing that the wholesome state that was abiding for the past few days and for the past week, it now arises and passes away more quickly. And I was just curious, is that normal too? Or does it indicate that there's not enough skill in sustaining it? Because I also know, also what's noticed is that all it can take is just a nice deep breath. And there's like joy pretty quickly again there.

**Speaker B:** That's right. So what you're— the skill that you're developing now is furthering the skill of seeing what thoughts are wholesome and what thoughts are not wholesome. And some of the thoughts that you're seeing now that are unwholesome would at first look like that they're wholesome because you're checking your practice. How is my practice? What's this? In other words, you're going through a self-discovery phase. But later, after you've gotten yourself into that state, if you continue to have those thoughts, now they become a hindrance to you. All right, so it starts as 'Am I doing it right?' or 'What if the joy—' the 'what if,' 'what about'-isms that happen. 'What if the thrill is gone?' or 'What if the joy is gone?' or 'What if the practice that I'm using doesn't bring the joy?' Well,

**Speaker A:** maybe that's going on. I mean, I've seen those thoughts going on.

**Speaker B:** You just said

**Speaker A:** It's not all I said, though. That's not all I said, though. That's not all I said. What I'm saying is, I was noticing in the beginning that the wholesome state was abiding. And now the wholesome state, you know, what I mean is like, okay, it'd be like, yeah, it'd feel good, be wholesome for, you know, maybe the whole day, a number of hours throughout the day with little moments in between. Of like noticing the unwholesome, replacing that, whatever.

**Speaker B:** But there'd still be like— congratulate yourself for that. Again, just say it's okay, because the way the tone of voice is going, sliding down here, is almost as if there is a yes-but coming.

**Speaker A:** I just— Dhammarato, I need a minute to just say what I'm gonna say, please.

**Speaker B:** I know what you're going to say, and it's that Things are going along really well and then they stop.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it's just that I don't, I don't know if it's because there's unwholesome thoughts going on or there's just been so much exposure to this joy that the intensity is just dropping. Because it'll get really intense and then it'll be like this, it'll get really intense and it'll get like this.

**Speaker B:** Is the really intense more, um, let us say, satisfactory than the less intense?

**Speaker A:** I'd say so. Sometimes. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right. So now when it gets less intense, can we be satisfied with that? Okay. As we talked about that, the Piti melts into Sukkha, which melts into Upekkha. Okay. And one is just as satisfying as the next. If you allow it to be. It's up to you to develop this satisfaction so that you could be satisfied while you're intensely listening to your boss chew you out. You could be satisfied when the meeting goes on and on. You could be satisfied when that obnoxious kid down the corridor there puts his charts up and tries to explain to the audience what he's doing. Any of that kind of stuff, you could still be satisfied. In the case of the meetings, we also have the obligation to pay attention to what the meeting is doing. And therefore you can derive your satisfaction from knowing that you're paying attention to the meeting. Okay, this is the satisfaction. And so when those thoughts come of, what if this, that, and the other happens and then I don't feel satisfied, the answer to that is, hey, I could feel satisfied anyway. I can feel safe. I can feel secure. I can feel comfortable. I can feel satisfied. And that elation of success comes and goes with that as a base. But if you're not satisfied, you're not going to get any of the yeehaw success. So always keep satisfaction as the base. This is what we're shooting for. No matter what's going on inside or outside, if there is a hindrance in the mind that prevents us from being satisfied, we say, aha, I see that. Taking a deep breath, and the satisfaction comes right back again.

**Speaker A:** Feeling frustrated right now, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** I know. Look at the frustration and say, aha, I see you, frustration. I've got a handle on you now. Alex, frustration is almost your favorite feeling.

**Speaker A:** I've been doing so well, I haven't had this.

**Speaker B:** Great. Okay, so congratulate yourself. And when the frustration comes, you say, I see you, frustration, you're back again. Hello, darkness, my old friend. Okay, the frustration will return, and it will return, and it will return. The question is, how good are you, how skilled that you are catching it before you get super frustrated? Can you just get a niggle of frustration and this— ah, I see that. Yeah. And take a deep breath and let that frustration pass. Or you could get stuck in that orbit of frustration. Okay. And right now you're not nearly as frustrated as you were just one minute ago.

**Speaker A:** No. Victory. Congratulations. Success.

**Speaker B:** Um, so see that frustration? No. See it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Because you are not frustrated. You are not frustration. You are the one who sees the frustration.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. I like to just use I now

**Speaker B:** because it's too much work.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's getting— I don't want to put more on.

**Speaker B:** It's a habit. It's a habit to be developed.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I think what I want to do is do that practice with you when we have our calls. I've noticed I've also done it like sometimes when texting, just, you know, I've just noticed it throughout the day.

**Speaker B:** Well, here's the point. That's the point, is to begin to notice how many of the thoughts are self-referential. Yeah, I think in my opinion, and, and each individual is taught to keep bringing his self into every event and every occurrence. All right, and the better thing to do is to be the witness rather than the one who is involved in the event or the the one who is frustrated. Rather, it's better to just see frustration as frustration rather than jumping in its sewer.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay. Okay.

**Speaker B:** You can— you can stand back and be able to see frustration. Aha. Rather than, oh, I feel so frustrated.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I could see that one too. I feel so frustrated. I can see that. I see that. Ah, that's okay.

**Speaker B:** You are not the frustration.

**Speaker A:** Come take— come have a hug and enjoy this joy with me, right?

**Speaker B:** Come enjoy the frustration. A warm fuzzy frustration.

**Speaker A:** So all in all, I want to make— I congratulate myself for starting again today. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Every day is a new day.

**Speaker A:** So many times, not so many, but about 5 or 6 when I started this practice with you, I would be in the ditch for like a week or days and I would give up. And today I started again, and that's great. That's awesome. It was challenging. It was challenging today. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Well, here's the point here. Listen, this is important. The main skill that we are developing is the skill of picking yourself up, dusting yourself off, It's starting over again. Okay, most people think the practice is staying out of the ditch.

**Speaker A:** Well, isn't sustaining part of that?

**Speaker B:** No. Well, no, that's the whole point, is once you've gotten up. But, uh, the point is, is that no, we need to practice getting out of the ditch over and over again because you're going to wind back up in the ditch, never mind how good you are as sustaining it, you're going to wind up back in the ditch. And we need to develop the skill of coming out of the ditch. In fact, that's the first thing, and you just mentioned that in the sense that you would spend a week in the ditch. Now you're not going to spend a week in the ditch, you can spend a day in the ditch. But now you're not going to spend a day in a ditch, you're not even going to spend an hour in the ditch.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right, that's the whole point now, is that's the skill of being— this being developed is number one, recognize you're in a ditch, and number two, get out of it with the right And sometimes it appears that that ditch is too hard to get out of because every time you get out of it, you fall right back into it. All right. But never mind. You're actually developing the skill of coming back out of it again and again and again and again. That's the skill to being developed is the skill of getting up, picking yourself up and dusting yourself off. Now, here's the way of looking at it. Is that as we begin to get skilled at picking ourselves and dusting ourselves off, then we begin to get quick at not staying in the ditch very long. We come immediately back out of it. Then we develop the skill of, as we're going into the ditch, we begin to develop the skill of coming back out of it. It's almost like, have you ever tripped and not actually fallen down? Yeah, yeah, that's the whole point. Now the new skill is, is that you're not— you're just going to get tripped and stumble, but you're not going to fall flat on your face again and stay in the ditch for a week.

**Speaker A:** I'm pretty confident I've already cultivated that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's exactly what we're working on then, is the ability to slip and not fall.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and see the slipping and the potential falling before it happens too.

**Speaker B:** As it happens, at least.

**Speaker A:** As it happens, or even before it happens.

**Speaker B:** Well, when you do it before it happens, now that's called wisdom.

**Speaker A:** That's happening too.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. As we begin to see the trajectory of things, we begin to say, oh, if I don't look at that root and avoid it, I'll trip over it. And if I trip, I might fall, and if I might fall, I might hurt myself and lay in the mud for a week.

**Speaker A:** Now that's interesting you said that, because the other insight I thought I had today is that the Dukkha itself, when I see something as Dukkha, like I see you and acknowledge that as Dukkha, that that in and of itself is in some sense Dukkha too. Because if I could just enjoy this moment and just cultivate this joy in the here now and enjoy this and enjoy that and congratulate myself and say that's a success and all that and have all these wholesome thoughts, why I need to look at Dukkha? If I have all this wholesome stuff going on, why do I need to look at Dukkha? So eventually, it sounds like it kind of gets to a point where you can just, oh, I don't need to, I don't need to know exactly what thought that was, but I know, I know that that was Dukkha. I'm just going to, I'm just going to stay over here in the joy.

**Speaker B:** That's exactly correct. Okay. So even now, see, before we wanted to make sure that it's Dukkha before we had to get rid of it because it's my thought. But now you're cultivating it to the point that I'm not even going to have to look at it that closely. I'm just going to throw this thing out and get something better.

**Speaker A:** Good, good. So that is okay then, right? You don't need to know exactly what color it is, you know, what kind of clothes it's wearing, and you know what it likes to eat for breakfast.

**Speaker B:** That's the Mahasi method. Okay. And in a way, that's also psychology.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And we're not practicing psychology, and we're not practicing that kind of Mahasi method. We're practicing it just enough to know what is wholesome and unwholesome, and that's all we need to know. How it's dressed and what color it is and how it's related to the other dukkhas and all of that kind of stuff. No, this thought is dukkha.

**Speaker A:** Good.

**Speaker B:** Out it goes.

**Speaker A:** So going upstream then, going upstream, I had an experience today where I noticed this, this, this process happening. And as an experiment, instead of focusing on whatever that unwholesome thought was, instead of even taking the time to do the imagery that I'm doing, right, and replacing it with wholesome, all I did, as I said, oh, I saw it, congratulations, and I took a breath. And then I started more and more and more to focus on and enjoy each moment of the breath. Long inhale, long exhale while I was working. I wasn't closing my eyes. I was working, going on the computer, like looking up people to call. And I was able to notice each moment of the breath and really enjoy it as it was happening. And then whenever the unwholesome would show up again, it'd be the same thing. Oh, saw it. Whoop, I'm back. Whoop, saw it. Whoop, I'm back. Over and over and over again until what I started noticing is I could just be looking at my screen and then it would be like unwholesome. Oh, I saw it. Okay, I'm back. Oh, I saw it. Okay, I'm back. And it was just like that over and over and over again until the breath started taking a very very long time, the longest inhale and longest exhale I've ever experienced. And then something even weirder happened. The breath, the breath started going, I started observing the breath going beyond the point at which I thought I was going to start exhaling. So I thought, okay, I'm going to exhale now. I'm going to start the long exhale, and it would go beyond that point. And I was like, okay, I couldn't control it anymore. And I started to gag and yawn a lot. And I was like gagging on the yawn. And I was just curious if you knew anything about this, or if this makes sense to you.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it does. Because the yawning has to do with tiredness. Now, that tiredness can happen. In fact, a lot of yawns happen because people are not breathing well, like in the meeting. Meetings are a place where people yawn. And not only that, but you probably heard that yawns are contagious. Basically what you could say is they're not actually contagious, but when one yawns, it gives another permission to yawn. Now also, that means that yawning is associated then with taking a deep breath. So it would be natural to have it triggered in reverse, so that you're taking deep breaths, the yawn reaction is there. That in fact, I imagine that you're actually fighting having a yawn right now. Because we're talking about yawning, and it's a very amazing thing that when people start talking about yawning, they have the feeling that they need to yawn or they want to yawn. You can feel it in the jaws. Could you feel anything in your— in the face now about yawning?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, my throat.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay. So yawning is associated— I thought so. I was wondering when that was going to happen.

**Speaker A:** So Dhammarato, what about the part that I was saying that the breath got longer and longer and longer and longer, and then I started— it was like—

**Speaker B:** if you're getting longer in the sense of very, very long but perhaps not deep, then that might have been triggered because in fact you weren't getting enough oxygen, and so the yawn triggered it. To have a deeper breath.

**Speaker A:** No, I mean, I don't know.

**Speaker B:** That seems to me that in the practice that the breathing does get longer and longer and longer and longer. And if the body is completely relaxed at that time, then it's much more practical. It's much more possible then to go into the fourth jhana. But what will happen is, is that if the breath gets really, really, really long, that the body is not completely relaxed, it was then needs more energy. And so therefore a need for the breathing. And so that yawn is a triggered reaction. Okay. And the yawn is triggered in back in the back with the pineal and pituitary glands, and it has that yawn. Which is also almost a gasp for air.

**Speaker A:** So Jeff was— I told Jeff about this, you know, Jeff on the Sangha, and he suggested, he suggested talking to you about this because he thinks what it could have been is an experience, an insight into no-self. Because what ended up happening is, I don't know if you caught this the first time.

**Speaker B:** Oh well, I like that joke too. There's a joke in there and it's just, oh, that's me. Yawn. When you begin to see who you really are, you take a yawn because it's boring. And we thought that we were so special. So there's that quality to it, but that's kind of more of a joke.

**Speaker A:** Okay, yeah. So what was happening is that I was taking— I was going on the inhale, and what I'm trying to tell you is that Normally, I can just take an inhale for as long as I want and an exhale as long as I want. Okay, this case, what I'm saying what happened is the inhale went longer than I tried to make it go. It was as if something else was controlling my breath. And so what Jeff was saying perhaps is that we have no control over processes.

**Speaker B:** Over process, we don't have the insight. You don't. You do not. In fact, there is no place in any of the suttas, and I was worried about this being in India for a while. Why doesn't the Buddha have heartbeat as an object of meditation? The answer is you can't control it, so it has no value. There's a lot of process. I mean, why don't we meditate on digestion of food? Because we can't control that. But why then do we have mindfulness of eating? It's because we can control the movement of the mouth, we can move the tongue around, we can move the food, we can suck it dry and swallow the juice and then continue to chew on the ruppage. This is all possible, and so this would be an object of meditation because it can be controlled. But heartbeat, don't control that. Therefore, we don't have that as an object of meditation. So yawns, as we're saying, are almost involuntary, just like a sneeze is almost completely involuntary. However, they are a little bit voluntary that people can stifle a sneeze. There's also the issue of touching the nose around here that if you are about to sneeze, if you rub this area of the face and nose, it will prevent a sneeze. So there is some control. The same thing is true. There is some control over a yawn, but not completely. That when you yawn, you can stifle it. You can force your mouth to be closed. You can yawn on the inside but keep your lips together. Or you could just let a whole yawn go.

**Speaker A:** What about the breath, though? What about the breath? Because I was asking you about— I've already talked.

**Speaker B:** I've already talked about how the breath is tied to yawning, that big deep breaths will trigger a yawn. But then long, slow breaths that are not getting enough oxygen will trigger a yawn. Both, both of those would be yawn triggering.

**Speaker A:** No, I got that part. I got that part, but I asked something different the second time.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** The second time I asked you, I said, what happened? What is happening when the breath, the inhale goes beyond the point?

**Speaker B:** It's really hard to think about that. Why don't you look at it this way? This is something for you to to discover for yourself that in fact, I think that we're getting a little bit too much in the weeds with exactly how to practice and exactly what's going on, which is your style of being perfect. A lot of this has to be looked at from the perspective of an adventure of discovery, rather than having it all put down on the map before you go into the territory.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker B:** I just— okay, the map's not the territory, and so there's a lot of it that we can't talk through.

**Speaker A:** I just feel like we really haven't— really haven't been, um, we really haven't been on the same page much tonight. I feel like a lot of the things I've asked or said, maybe you, you didn't hear, or you, you answered them in a way that was different from how I asked, and Well, that's

**Speaker B:** the intention, is to get you out of your frame of reference and get you into a reference of discovery rather than the situation of I've got to go find what, uh, in reality what I see on this map. Please tell me all about the map so I can go find all of the— and discover all of those things that are on the map. And my position here is that the maps are never going to be complete. There's always going to be things that are in the territory that are not on the map. So reading a map is not necessarily the best skill that we're going to develop, but rather the best skill that we're going to be developing is to look at what's going on, to pay attention in the present moment.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, what I did.

**Speaker B:** So you're coming away from those things with a whole lot of questions to ask me rather than just thinking, oh well, that was nice, I'll look at that again when I see it.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** All right. All right. A lot of these details are not really important. What's important is, can you see unwholesome thoughts? As unwholesome and then change them to wholesome. That's the big one, okay? For everybody, not just you, but for everybody.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And, and, and the— and whether a thought is wholesome or not is for you to discover for yourself.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay. All right, I'm gonna go relax.

**Speaker B:** And we're in— it's okay we're not on the same page tonight. That's all right. We can handle that. That's all right, nothing wrong with that. I'm quite satisfied.

**Speaker A:** Okay, good. Me too.

**Speaker B:** Excellent. All right, well, I'll go talk to Kishon for a while and we'll catch you later. All right, thanks, Dhammarato. We still have Paticcasamuppada, so continue with the exercise of knowing how your language continuously bring self into it, self-referential language that we use.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So continue playing with that, making it a game. And when you, uh, like when you said, well, I don't want to play the game right now, recognize that too, because you don't have to be perfect at it. It's okay that you use the word I. Yeah, but in fact, when you do it, one of the things that you can do then is that you can make it really, really big and juicy, like you heard me, me, me, me, me, me, me do. All right, so that's exactly how to practice it. Instead of saying I and then letting it slip, what you can do is bring it big. I, I, I, I, I see this. I— and then you continue with Okay, cool. Bring it up and make it a toy when you see it.

**Speaker A:** All right, I will do that.

**Speaker B:** Excellent, excellent. Have fun. This is a new toy to play with, this human mind. Okay, enjoy it. And here we thought that the duty of that mind was to go figure out the world. The real duty of the mind is to figure out the mind. And then we can deal with the world easy. Easy peasy when you've got the mind straightened out.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** Thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** See those hindrances? Watch closely. I see that thought of doubt. Arahant.

**Speaker A:** I see it.

**Speaker B:** What if the joy is gone? Ah, I see that thought too.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** All righty.

**Speaker A:** All right. Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Until again.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) with a student (Speaker A) and Sangha friends, centers on the core practice of recognizing and replacing unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones, and how to maintain that joyful, mindful state in daily life. Here is a summary of the key themes and instructions:

### **Core Practice: Working with Thoughts**
*   **The Nature of Doubt & Critical Thoughts:** The discussion begins with analyzing a common experience: seeing clearly that there is no doubt in the present moment, only to have a thought immediately arise saying, "But maybe there is doubt." Dhammarato identifies this follow-up thought *itself* as the doubt—it's not reporting on some separate feeling. This is the "parent ego state" or old conditioning (like "you don't deserve this yet") trying to "rain on the parade" of clarity and joy.
*   **The Formula:** The fundamental skill is to **catch unwholesome thoughts (like doubt, worry, self-criticism) as soon as they arise, recognize them as unwholesome, and consciously replace them with a wholesome thought.** A wholesome replacement can be a congratulation ("Aha! I see that thought!"), an invitation back to joy, or a simple, satisfied focus on the breath.
*   **Developing the Skill:** The goal is to "wake up sooner" to these thoughts. Catching them early is "fast right effort"—like a quarterback positioning himself to catch a ball easily rather than making a desperate leap. The frequency, speed, and duration of mindful recognition are what get developed.

### **Taking the Practice into the World**
A major theme is transitioning from secluded practice to engaged daily life (meetings, time with a partner, etc.).
*   **The Challenge:** The student expresses concern that engaging with the world scatters attention and diminishes the wholesome, joyful state (Piti-Sukha) cultivated in meditation.
*   **The Solution: Metta as Focused Attention:** Dhammarato's advice is to apply the **same skill of focused attention** to the external world. Instead of letting the mind scatter, pour all your attention into the present activity—listen intently in a meeting, be fully present with your partner. This focused, engaged attention *is* a wholesome state and a form of *Metta* (loving-kindness).
*   **Handling Dukkha in Action:** When an unwholesome thought arises during an activity, you handle it the same way: note it ("I see that frustration") and gently return your full attention to the person or task at hand, doing so with a joyful or satisfied attitude. The "anchor" of cultivated joy makes it easier to spot and release the unwholesome thought.

### **Refinements and Insights**
*   **Sustaining Joy:** The student notes that the intensity of joy naturally fluctuates. Dhammarato advises to **cultivate satisfaction as a stable base**. Whether the joy is intense or mild, be satisfied with it. The Piti (rapture) will mellow into Sukha (happiness) and then Upekkha (equanimity), all of which can be deeply satisfying.
*   **The "Ditch" is Part of the Path:** A crucial insight is that the primary skill is **not avoiding "the ditch" (states of dukkha) but learning to get out of it quickly.** Progress is measured by shortening the time spent in the ditch—from a week, to a day, to an hour, to a moment—and eventually just stumbling without fully falling.
*   **From Analysis to Intuition:** As the practice matures, you don't need to psychoanalyze every unwholesome thought ("what color it's wearing"). You simply recognize its quality as unwholesome and replace it. The practice becomes more fluid and immediate.
*   **Language and Self-View:** Throughout, Dhammarato playfully encourages noticing and reducing self-referential language ("I," "me," "my"). The practice is about being the **witness** of experience (e.g., "frustration is arising") rather than identifying as the experiencer ("*I am* frustrated"). This helps deconstruct the sense of a solid, suffering self.

### **Conclusion & Encouragement**
The talk ends with an emphasis on **playful discovery** over having a perfect "map." The territory of the mind will always present unexpected experiences (like the long breath and yawning discussed). The essence is to maintain the adventurous spirit of the practice: see the unwholesome, replace it with the wholesome, and do so with increasing speed and satisfaction, whether in solitude or in the middle of a busy life.

**In essence:** The talk is a practical guide to transforming the mind's habit patterns by vigilantly cultivating wholesome thoughts and joyful attention, thereby building a resilient and satisfied mind capable of engaging the world with wisdom and kindness.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several key metaphors and stories to illustrate the process of working with thoughts, developing mindfulness, and changing one's mental habits. Here are the main ones:

### 1. **The Parent, Adult, and Child Ego States (from Transactional Analysis)**
   * **Metaphor:** The mind is described as having different "ego states": a critical **"parent"** voice (which doubts, criticizes, and says "you haven't worked hard enough"), a curious or experiencing **"child"** state (which can feel joy and see clearly), and a conceptual **"adult"** state.
   * **Purpose:** To explain the internal conflict. The "child" may see clearly ("there's no doubt"), but the "parent" voice quickly intervenes with doubt and criticism ("rain on the parade"). The practice involves recognizing the "parent" voice as old programming and choosing to nurture the "child" with joy and credit.

### 2. **Catching the Football (The Quarterback Analogy)**
   * **Story:** A quarterback trying to catch a pass. If he reads the trajectory correctly and positions himself early, catching the ball is easy. If he misjudges it, he has to make a spectacular, effortful leap at the last second.
   * **Purpose:** To illustrate the importance of **"fast right effort"** in meditation. The sooner you catch (become aware of) an unwholesome thought, the less effort it takes to deal with it. Developing mindfulness is about "waking up sooner" to your thoughts.

### 3. **Centripetal Force & Changing Orbits**
   * **Metaphor:** The mind is like a planet in orbit. Our usual worldview (e.g., "everything's a problem," political hatreds) is the gravitational center we circle around. The practice builds a new center—a worldview of "everything's all right, there's no worries here"—creating a new, joyful orbit through **centripetal force**.
   * **Purpose:** To explain how sustained practice creates a self-reinforcing cycle of joy and wholesome intention, fundamentally changing one's baseline experience of the world.

### 4. **Fixing the System vs. Fixing the Broken Heart**
   * **Story:** People spend millions of hours trying to fix external systems (political, social), but the systems are broken because they were built by people with "broken hearts." You can't fix the system with a broken heart; you have to fix the heart first.
   * **Purpose:** To emphasize that the primary work is internal. Changing your own mind and heart (your "orbit") is a prerequisite for effective and peaceful engagement with the world.

### 5. **The Dodgeball Game**
   * **Metaphor:** Engaging with the world is like a game of dodgeball, facing the "slings and arrows of outrageous fortune." The skills developed in seclusion (spotting and dodging unwholesome thoughts) are now used to dodge real-world provocations by staying present and joyful.
   * **Purpose:** To frame the transition from solitary practice to engaged living as the application of a skill—staying mindful and joyful amidst external challenges.

### 6. **The Ditch (Falling and Getting Back Up)**
   * **Metaphor:** The practice isn't about never falling into negative mental states ("the ditch"). It's about developing the skill of **recognizing you're in the ditch** and **getting out quickly**. Progress is measured by how fast you recover, not by never falling.
   * **Extension:** First, you learn to get out of the ditch after a week. Then after a day, then an hour. Then you learn to stumble (catch the thought) without fully falling. Finally, you develop the wisdom to see the root (the trigger) before you even trip.
   * **Purpose:** To encourage perseverance and redefine success in practice, making it about resilience and rapid recovery rather than perfection.

### 7. **The Map is Not the Territory**
   * **Metaphor:** Intellectual understanding and instructions are the "map," but direct experience is the "territory." You can't put every detail of the territory on the map.
   * **Purpose:** To caution against over-intellectualizing and seeking perfect, pre-defined answers for every experience (like the long breath and yawning). It encourages an attitude of **adventure and discovery** in practice.

### 8. **Sitting on the Couch / The Nudge**
   * **Story:** A couple watching TV. To stay connected to the present moment and each other (rather than getting absorbed in the screen), one partner gently nudges the other every few minutes.
   * **Purpose:** To give a practical, physical example of how to maintain mindful connection and joy ("Metta") in everyday activities with others.

### 9. **Making "I" a Toy**
   * **Metaphor:** The habit of self-referential language ("I, me, mine") is turned into a game or a "toy." When you catch yourself using "I," you can playfully exaggerate it ("I, I, I, I") to bring awareness to the habit without self-judgment.
   * **Purpose:** To make the practice of noticing and deconstructing the sense of self light-hearted and sustainable.

### Summary of Core Themes:
These metaphors collectively paint a picture of the mind as a **conditioned system** (parent/child tapes, orbits) that can be **retrained** through skillful effort (the quarterback, dodgeball). The goal is to build a **self-sustaining cycle of joy** (centripetal force) that is **resilient** (getting out of the ditch) and can be brought into **engaged living** (the nudge, fixing the heart). The speaker consistently uses tangible, often physical analogies to demystify internal mental processes.
