### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, so anyway, Michael, it's good to see you again and that you've got a question about the lower three fetters. So go for it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, my questions always kind of come with a bit of context. But I was reflecting on the lower three fetters in a way that I haven't before, not just from the conversations I've had with you, but from watching videos of you talking to your other students, and just realizing how significant it is and how practical it is to let go of those lower three fetters. The first one I was just talking about was how limiting it is, what I think identity view is in the lower three fetters, in that when we talk to people or you talk to people, or I even noticed myself about changing, you say, well, okay, maybe tell somebody to relax. And they'll say, well, I can't relax, that's not who I am. Or you tell somebody, you know, don't worry, be happy, and say, well, I'm a person who has anxiety, I can't do that. Or you know, hey, how would you, uh, oh, I know this person you could talk to who might make you feel better. Oh, talking to somebody wouldn't help me, right? So I've kind of gotten the sense like that when the Buddha talks about identity view and the way that you kind of talk about it, um, that that's kind of the type of identity view that, that, that restricts you from change. And then in the way that you talk about, um, attachment to rites and rituals, very practical way And you can.

**Speaker A:** Also see how difficult it is then for someone to get over that first fetter of personality view when everything around them, especially the priest and those who are trying to control them, will try to make sure that, oh, you can't change. I'm a CEO and you're a gardener or you're a sweeper. And it's going to stay that way. You can't be CEO, all right? That— but where that comes from that is so difficult to deal with at its lowest level is in religion, because both the Brahmins and the Christians are telling the same story, just in a different format. In the sense of, in Hinduism and in much of the, let us say, ordinary Buddhist mindset, is that we can't change because the situation that we're in now was determined from the past. We can't control the past, therefore we can't control the present moment. However, you can do enough in the present moment to make your future a little brighter. And so this is the background for alms and building temples and giving donations and all of that kind of stuff, that if you pay money now, you can get some future reward, but you can't change yourself or your circumstances now. Okay, that is the biggest lie that humanity has ever perpetrated on humanity. You could even go so far as to call it conservatism, that that is the conservative mentality. What is that? Is that I've got it and you don't, and I'm going to keep it and you won't? That's conservatism, okay? It's based upon a zero-sum game or a win-lose situation. And that, uh, because it's been in the religions, as— and all of the mommies believe the religions, we teach— they teach that to the kids without even having to express it openly. But it winds up in the situation of, oh well, that's who you are.

**Speaker B:** That's who you are. This is who I am.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and our vocabulary is full of it, like boys will be boys, leopards can't change their spots, the fruit doesn't fall far from the tree. I mean, these things, they just keep going on and on and on, which basically says no, you can't.

**Speaker B:** And it's connected to the attachment to rules and conventions and things like that.

**Speaker A:** That's one of the rules.

**Speaker B:** Right, boys will be boys. Like, you might— a person or a man might feel like, oh, you know, ashamed of themselves because like you cried or something. Okay, oh, now I'm not a man, right? Like, you've broken a rule that's been ingrained, ingrained in you. I was thinking like, uh, I'm a high school English teacher and we have this kind of concept of growth mindset, growth mindset versus fixed mindset. And fixed mindset is sort of like the old way of looking at students, like they can't change essentially, like some kids are good at math, some kids are good at English, some kids have good study habits, some kids don't, whereas the growth mindset is you see them as like dynamic and changeable.

**Speaker A:** Actually, that can get fixed early. That in fact, I remember exactly what happened with me, that one teacher in the second grade, her name was Mrs. Brown, by the way, And she gave me an outstanding. Never got an outstanding since then. And all of the others, either A, B, Cs, or Ds, but an outstanding. That is what put me into mathematics. It happened in the second grade. All right. That in fact, if the teachers in the first and second grade would praise the students, that will take them out of that fixed mentality into the I can. I can change mentality.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I've been applying that. What you talk about, the nurturing ego versus the critic ego, I've been applying that to myself, but also with my students, like trying to use like nurturing language to motivate them. And it works like magic.

**Speaker A:** That is the magic.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So I've been enjoying that a lot. There's, I like, I have like a whole list of things that I've been like, wow, this really applies to a lot.

**Speaker A:** Right, like every, every breath, everything you do is influenced by our mental attitude, which is either the attitude of a loser or the attitude of a winner. And that loser's attitude starts off progressive, and over time it changes to the loser's attitude of conservatism. But both the conservative and the liberal is a loser's position.

**Speaker B:** And that focus on attitude, it almost feels like attitude precedes everything else, you know, like even preceding contact, right? Because now that I'm practicing this attitude of the winner, as you call it, when like something makes contact with the mind, like let's say an old habit of irritation makes contact contact with the mind. Now, since my attitude is leaning towards looking at this, this next present moment and, you know, clearing the mind and creating a wholesome state, instead of diving into that irritation and becoming that irritation, now my mind is just clearing up right away because I have this precondition of that right attitude that you're talking about. That is there already, sort of before the old habit comes up, at least when it's working really well. Sometimes you get, you know, I'm really.

**Speaker A:** Glad you have seen that or discovered it for yourself, that in fact it is quite an important quality. But that attitude thing, let's talk about it like this. Imagine, or the analogy is a thought is same as a tree. Not the tree standing, but the thought is when the tree falls down and hits the ground. Okay, there's an action that's taken or something that creates that thought, and then the thought, or the tree, is going to fall. The thought's going to make contact. Okay, it's going to slam the ground. Okay, where does the tree slam the ground? The answer to that is the way that, let us say, the initial cuts with a chainsaw or an axe. The guy who's cutting the tree down wants it to fall in a certain direction, and so he undermines it there so that it will fall in the direction that is desired. And on YouTube, you can see an awful lot of tree fallings where the tree didn't go where they wanted it to go. It went on a house or a fence or or a car or something else, because they weren't watching closely what they were doing. So if we can have this analogy that the thought that falls was already leaning in that direction— why? Because that's how the underpinning was set up, which is the attitude. So our attitude then depends upon what kind of thoughts we're going to have. That's how important they are. But, but it is, um, the attitude interferes so fast that we're not aware of it, that in fact our attitude affects our thoughts. Well, what we can do then is understand that our thoughts also affect our attitudes.

**Speaker B:** It kind of makes me think of the Honeyball Sutra, you know, what one thinks that one perceives, that one thinks, what one thinks that one mentally proliferates. It's like that mental proliferation can go in one of two directions depending on the sort of precondition of the mind, like the attitude of the mind, the leaning of the mind, right? Like, like at that moment of perception, that sort of bubbling stream of causality can go in one direction or the other, dependent upon which way the mind is already leaning. That's one thing I was thinking about today when I was thinking about this right attitude, because I keep coming back to the right attitude when I feel like I'm forgetting what to do. I keep coming back to that. It seems for me to be the most effective reminder.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. We can say then that once a wheel is set in motion, then the proliferation of the mind is like that the wheel continues to spin in that direction. Okay, sort of like we've got this concept of clockwise and counterclockwise. But what we don't realize is that clockwise and counterclockwise are still a point of view. That you can take a clock and see that in fact the arms are ticking around the face of the clock clockwise. That's why they call it clockwise, is the 3 goes then down to the 4 in a clockwise position. But if you take the clock and turn it against the wall, now you may not— it may not be transparent, but if it was, now the clock goes counterclockwise, just like you can think of in the— the Earth goes around the Sun, and they almost always demonstrate it visually as going counterclockwise. But they could have just as easily done the art from the other direction, because who knows what's up and who knows what's down in outer space?

**Speaker B:** That's true.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but the northern hemisphere, it will continue to go in the same direction though. Once the Earth starts off in this direction around the Sun, whether we call it clockwise or counterclockwise depending upon our perception of it as an observer, it will continue to go in that direction. It doesn't stop and then go retrograde the way that they were trying to figure out the planets. At one time. They call them going retrograde. No, they were always going in the same direction. The perspective of where we were on the planet Earth is what made them look like that they were going backwards. It was because we were going forward in a certain way that made the other things appear to go backwards.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So if we can get it from that perspective, then we can take a whole kind of a different approach in the sense of recognizing that yes, it is the attitude, because not only does the attitude tell us where to chop at the bottom of the tree so that it'll fall in a certain direction, we can also recognize that that perspective or that attitude that we have, or that view that we have, can also be moved and changed around, that we don't have to see the Earth going around the Sun counterclockwise. We can change our perspective and say, you know, now it's going around it clockwise. If we can do that, begin to change our perceptions this way, then that means that we can change this perception, we can change our attitude. That's profound that we can change.

**Speaker B:** That's the biggest thing that I've taken from these conversations. I've thought about it in so many different ways. I was thinking about the fact that perception is the part of the mind that selects from everything that's pouring into the senses. You know, you got 40 million bits of information.

**Speaker A:** And part of the filtering of the perceptions is our attitude.

**Speaker B:** Okay, because we filter the present with our attitude, right? Like, one person could be at Disneyland and be super happy, and another person could be at Disneyland and be in a terrible mood. But we also filter our interpretation of the past. So whatever way we identify ourselves, perception goes back and cherry-picks and alters memories from the past in order to fit that narrative. So that we can continue to see ourselves in the way that we have conditioned, we've been conditioned to see ourselves. And then that attachment to that constellation of perceptions is what keeps us going in the same cycles for the rest of our lives. And I think that's what that fetter.

**Speaker A:** Is really about, you know, unless we change.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And then once you, like you said, once you realize you can change, and you see how easy it is because in this next thought moment you can make a fresh choice, that fetter is in a way broken because that illusion is broken that you're just this fixed thing. Like, oh, this is this. And I like, for my, for example, with myself is I often would tell my students like, oh, you know, I have ADHD and blah blah blah, you know, or anybody I'm talking to because I tend to, I've always just thought I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was in middle school and I've always used that label to explain some of my habits. But ever since I started doing this, I don't feel like— I don't feel the ADHD anymore. I don't feel like as scattered. I'm still talking a lot, but I don't feel as scatterbrained or whatnot.

**Speaker A:** So kind of like— what was that diagnosis again? ADHD?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that means absolutely downright human. Definitely, yeah. That in fact, it's very profitable for the medical profession to take an ordinary thing from an ordinary kid, put a diagnostic label on it, give the parents some medicines, and you're still in business. Or another way of saying it, every kid has attention disorders. That's why little Johnny's looking out the window rather than listening to the teachers, because the teacher boring according to his attitude. Okay, so, um, I don't— because I have spent so much time in great detail with these diagnostic codes, I don't count on them. In fact, the, uh, the psychology professor profession is trying to figure out how they can get rid of them because, because it's nothing but a money-making scheme. And we would— someday or another like to change psychology so that it can actually begin to help people.

**Speaker B:** Too many labels.

**Speaker A:** Too many labels. So we actually should wear the only label that fits: human. Which is not necessarily a superlative.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, or just organism.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's okay to put us at the top of the primate chain. We can call them primates, all right? But that doesn't make us as smart as we think we are. That humanity is pretty stupid. It's in danger of clutching itself to death. Yeah, because of the greed and ill will and the ignorance around greed and ill will. We think all things are dangerous when in fact they're not. Okay, well, let's go get all the knives, guns, money, and protection that we can get so that we can feel safe, when in fact none of those things will make us safe. And there's the delusion. Number one, the delusion is things are dangerous. Number two, I can go buy my way into safety. Those two things are basic fallacies that every child comes up with because they're taught it that way from their parents. Their parents believe that, and so without actually stating it directly, we feed all of that stuff to our kids, leaving us ignorantly greedy and ignorantly fearful. We don't like things, think they're dangerous, okay, they're harmful. So, when we begin to change, what we're really changing is our attitude. First, we want win-win to be correct. We don't want win-lose or zero-sum games to be life. We want win-win to be life. We kind of want it, even though we don't believe it. We believe that win-lose is the way that the game is played. But we would like to see it, our altruistic nature would like to see it as a win-win situation, but it's still not an attitude yet. It's just kind of an evil desire, maybe.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that seems to be another one of those rules that we've kind of ingested, like 'Oh, you can't be happy all the time. That's not how life works.'.

**Speaker A:** You know, like— And the real answer to that is that you're not happy all the time because that's how you work at it. But that whole statement right there is projection. Because I see it this way, it must be that way. Okay, because I lie, that means that you're a liar, etc. Yeah, I'm not supposed to lie, so you're not supposed to lie either, especially not to me. And our whole society is built on those little, little things about the supposed tos rather than the realities. Hence, Anicca.

**Speaker B:** Better. It's like, I'm— I, you know, I took a— I took longer to call you back this time because I was like trying to figure out what I would ask you, because I— every time I think of a question, I'm like, well, that's just— that question is stemming from dissatisfaction. So what should I— what would I ask? I was like, well, maybe I could just come up with a topic of conversation.

**Speaker A:** Um, well, you don't have to call because you, uh, have a burning question. You can call because you're cool.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And you know, there's more to that. Let me finish with this point, and that is that question asking and doubt is a fetter, it's a hindrance. And that the worst kind, or the worst kind for it to happen is when we're meditating, sitting there actually wanting to practice, and the questions about how to practice come up, the doubts about how to practice, where in fact the practice itself is dead easy. And that means that there's only a little bit for us to know, just enough. And yet the human mind, especially in this modern society, is trained to gather knowledge. We gather, we gather knowledge today the way that the hunter-gatherers went out and gathered, uh, plants. I like, uh, my biggest addiction, or like going into the grocery store because we need milk and we wind up coming out of the grocery store with a whole grocery cart, $100 lighter, right? Because we went gathering. That's the way that we do. And so we want to gather up and know and know and know. And so this is the basis of the questions, and it's really good to get to the place that you've recognized that you know enough now. You'll never know everything, that in fact ignorance becomes the better at the end, uh, when we are able to deal with the fact we'll not ever know everything. I don't need to know everything. It's okay for me to make mistakes. To get the facts wrong or to not care. Okay, that's all right. We don't have to get it correct or exact. What we can get it though is a correct practice so that we begin to be nurturing to ourselves and loving ourselves rather than being critical of ourselves because we've made some mistake and we don't have all the information, which is where the questions come from anyway. So now we're all the way back to Sila, Vata, Paramasa after all. Our attitudes are determined by the rule systems that we keep. In fact, this is a good introduction into what determines one's personality. What is personality? How do we know what a personality is? And the easy way to understand it from a the Buddhist perspective is that the personality is determined by our set of rules, by our set of Sila, Vata, Paramasa, how the world is supposed to be, the ideal. I am what I'm supposed to be, or I'm trying my best to live up to that and feeling failure from it. So there's actually a second quality, and that is that it's not only the rules themselves but is how we respond at the basic gut or child level to these rules.

**Speaker B:** So those two fetters are basically like linked to each other, the attachment to rules and the identity.

**Speaker A:** Really, really tight together. Yes, that the personality view is determined by the rules. And if one of the rules is you can't change, then your personality can't change. Until we can dislodge that so that people can learn very slowly that in fact they can change, that that personality is not fixed, and that the way that we change the personality is by disregarding the rules.

**Speaker B:** It makes sense that this would be— these two, along with doubt, would be the lower three fetters. Because you've— have you heard the joke? How many, how many Dharma teachers does it take to change a person, or to change a light bulb? Sorry.

**Speaker A:** No, I haven't heard that one. I assume it's a joke, and I probably got my own punchline coming, so go for it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So how many— it's funny, it makes me laugh every time. How many Dharma teachers does it take to change a light bulb? One. But the light bulb really has to want to change. Or you could supplement Dharma teacher with therapist. But yeah, so, right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, you can't change your answers. Here's 7 different answers. It takes all of them and they still can't do it. I've got a new student. Pedro is calling. Is it okay to add him to the call?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's fine. Sure.

**Speaker A:** Hello Pedro, welcome to our call. This is Michael.

**Speaker B:** Oh, hello, how you doing?

**Speaker A:** Can you change your camera to, uh, horizontal? There you go, that's much better. Okay, so when you joined, we were just discussing a joke How many Dharma teachers does it take to change a light bulb? Okay, that's adapted from an old joke about how many psychologists does it take to control, uh, to change a light bulb. And the answer is that it only takes one psychologist to change the light bulb, but they've all got to be there to enjoy the experience. And so how many Dharma teachers does it take to change a light bulb? And Michael's got one answer. What is that answer, Michael?

**Speaker B:** Uh, it takes only one, but the light bulb has to really want to change.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so another answer would that— would, would be that Dhamma teachers don't know how to change light bulbs. And then maybe along with that, they don't even know how to change themselves.

**Speaker B:** We were essentially discussing how the ability to change is sort of the biggest leap right at the beginning, getting over attachment to rules and conventions and attachment to personality, those things that make us not change. And then realizing that we can change is like that first big leap. So that's where that joke kind of got introduced.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I mean, there comes a moment for everybody when we decide to change. And then there is also how much we want to change, because maybe some people just want to change the house furniture, but somebody that gets near to the Dharma maybe wants really to change the whole ecosystem of his mind and of himself, maybe also all his habits. So he really puts his whole ecosystem of human being into the practice.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely. And what you said there was actually quite revealing. People wanting to change their furniture is because they don't like that old furniture and they want some new furniture, right? Which means the delusion that they're in there is, I'll feel better if the furniture changes. I won't change myself, the furniture will change me for me. But in fact, that's one of the first levels of doubt that we have to deal with. We were talking about personality view and how the personality view is determined by our set of rules. And one of the rules many people have is you can't change. Like in the Bible that says, who are you to be good? Only God can be good. And the answer to that is, the way he acts, I can be better than him anytime. But, but people get the point is, is that no, they can't change, uh, that they need a Jesus, they need a savior, or that we need a help. We need, in fact, The light bulb needs the Dharma teacher, because the light bulb can't change itself, which is another part of the— or one of the last punchlines to that joke, is that the light bulb don't need no Dharma teacher, he just pops himself right out. So, um, the doubt though has many different forms, or actually three basic forms. And the first one that comes from the victimhood is the victim can't change himself. The victim is in fact victimized because he can't change himself. If the victim could change himself, then he'd just change himself enough to where he was no longer the victim. But we are born victims, we are born helpless, we are born dependent, and society keeps each one of us there. We don't want anyone to actually grow up and be fully whole adult human being on their own. It's just not practiced in our society. In other words, we're taught to continuously, for the rest of our lives, be dependent upon society. One thought about that would be how humans will capture a baby wild animal and then keep it just a little while with the idea of reintroducing it back to the wild. Have you ever heard of that or seen that kind of thing? That they don't just throw the animal out in the wild and let it go, they will put it into kind of a controlled habitat so that it's a bit safe. But after a little while, they'll let the animal go. Or a wild bird that has gotten a broken wing, and we let them wheel in the house, and then we throw them out and we let them go. But with humans, we don't ever let them go. But the society wants to keep abusing. You've got to have a job. You can't just go and do what you want to for the rest of your adulthood. You got to do what you're told to do. They're going to make sure you won't survive unless you do what you're told to do. So this kind of mentality keeps us stuck in a victim's position. And the doubt is, who can I help to, or who can I get to help me because I am helpless? I need a religion, I need a preacher, I need a psychologist, I need a Dharma teacher, I need meditation, I need a pill, I need a car, I need, I need, I need. And so we get into this state of needing and wanting from this victim's position. And so the first one of the early things that the student has to learn within Buddhism, and in fact the whole point of the Second Noble Truth, is to help them to get over that and come to the answer is, is there ain't nobody going to help you but you. Only the light bulb can change. Dharma teachers not change light bulbs, they don't know how to do that. There you go. So if we can come to that, that's a major, major change in one's attitude. From, "I'm going to have to do this myself." But then the next question arises, and this is the big one that most of them struggle with for quite a while, and that is the question: Am I up to the job? If I've got to change myself, and nobody else can do it for me, can I do that? Will I be successful? Now, when we practice some forms of meditation like the Mahayana meditation, we never get the experience of being successful ever. All we do is keep looking at the same old crap over and over and over again. It kind of gets depressing. Some people call it a dark night of the soul. But within Anapanasati, it's already built upon that change model. That's what's built into the Second Noble Truth, is that your greed, your ill will, and your delusion is already within your own mind. And the only way to change that is for you to change it yourself. And so that's what we begin to practice. We begin to practice making changes. What change? This thought. This one thought is what we're going to change. We can't change the future, we can't change our destiny, we can't change our personality, but what we can change is this thought. And we can change the thought if we remember to change the thought. And so the Sati and the waking up to see what the thought is, and then the the right noble effort, these are the three points of the Eightfold Noble Path that gets us started, that will bring us then to that state of success, "I can do this." And in fact, the big success comes when the student— and it's called, by the way, the First Knowledge, the First Noble Knowledge— is when the student says, "No matter how obsessed, how crowded, no matter how obstructed, how hindered my mind is, I can in fact clean that out and come back and see things the way that they really are. Hallelujah! That's the statement of success, that the student knows that he can change. But the reason that he knows that he can change is because he's got the confidence, is based upon a lot of experience of changing it. Every time we change the mind, we should know, I was able to change it. I can do this. I can change my feelings from being fearful into being safe and secure. I can change my posture from being uncomfortable into comfortable, and then I can change my feelings into being comfortable. I can do this. And so these are the kind of positive thoughts that we want to foster. To have no place to go and nothing to do, and the spring comes and the grass grows all by itself, don't need my help, I can just let it go. So when we keep practicing this way, this second kind of doubt becomes eradicated. In the sense that we change it from doubt about, "Can I do this or not?" into, "I can, and I will continue to. I can do it now, I can do it later, I can do it the time after that, I can keep doing it. All I have to do is remember, and I can do this." Okay, that's the second level of doubt. And the third level of doubt is the one that's stated most cleanly and clearly in the Suttas, and stated this way, this is one of the quotes, is that it is knowledge and vision of what is and is not the path. Now when I use the word "the path" here, what is and is not the path, means that I can recognize that most of the stuff that I've been doing my whole life is not the way that I'm going to live my life. In this case, the path actually means This is how I'm going to be living each moment, or this is the method of the moment. Every moment comes by, we will have this method. And what is the method? It's basically the Eightfold Noble Path. So it's knowledge and vision that this works and nothing else much does. And so when we come to that station, those are the three main fetters in. Personality view, adherence to rules, regulations that actually create and build our personality, and the knowledge and vision that I can change, and that I've got the method to do that. I've got it! Eureka! The Eightfold Noble Path is the way to go. That the Buddha's method works beyond any of the others. This is the kind of attitude that we develop. Okay, so these three fetters are often known, or let us say associated with, what is called the stream-enterer, or the Pali is the Srotapanna, and that what we're really talking about here then is that we begin to develop a noble mind. So when we talk about the word noble, we will assume that anybody who's gotten to the point that they know that they could clean the hindrances out of the mind because they've already gotten so good at doing that, then that one would be part of the group of nobles. Now along with that third doubt, the eradication of that third doubt about knowledge and vision of what is and is not the path basically means also taking refuge, finally taking refuge in the Dhamma. Or this is our home port, this is home, this is where we always go. Yeah, sometimes we got to go out in the high seas, but we always make it lickety-split right back into our safe harbor. Okay, this is where, uh, this is the refuge. They call it the Triple Gem. The Three Refuges, and in there we have the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. And in this case, we're talking about taking refuge specifically in the Dharma. Now, what do we mean basically about taking refuge in the Buddha? It's the knowledge, the vision, the understanding that we can be free from Dukkha. We can come out of it. We can learn to live a satisfied life. And now we've got the Dharma that shows us exactly how to do that. And the third item on the Triple Gem is our soulmates, our buddies, the other nobles, our friends, the ones who are around us that are practicing the same way. And so when we take refuge in the friendship of the Dhamma, having Dharma friends and Dhamma dudes as our friends, having the knowledge of the path and what is the path and what is not the path, and the knowledge that we can do this. What is it that we can do? The knowledge that I can be free from Dukkha. So these are the Triple Gems, and with this Triple Gem and the reduction and elimination of the first three fetters, then is normally referred to as the formality of the Srotapanna. Srotapanna in a formal kind of way. And along with that, if the mind is already noble now, or at least much of the time it's noble, because the Srotapanna is not going to be Srotapanna 100% of the time. Nothing is 100% of the time. Not even many of us are even human 100% of the time. Sometimes I'm driftwood. And so, we get into taking ceremonies that in fact, part of the ceremonies is taking the precepts. And so they take the precepts as well as the Triple Gem in a ceremony. This happens every Buddha Day. And why do they do these precepts? Well, the precepts actually come from the Eightfold Noble Path—right speech, right action, and right livelihood—but in the Eightfold Noble Path, it's talked about in a noble way, in the sense that when the mind is noble, When the mind is free from want, then you don't want anything bad enough to go kill somebody to get it. If you don't want anything, you're unlikely to go steal it. If you don't want that girl, you're more than likely not going to molest her, right? And if you want to keep the truth, then you're unlikely to tell a lie. So basing the actual precepts not upon a set of rules or a set of rituals or a set of ceremonies, we take them as the natural outcome from having a mind that has changed from being the victim into being a winner, into feeling good and comfortable and satisfied. But when we go to the wat and have these ceremonies, they will do the Triple Gem and take the precepts. Now, why do they do that? The answer to that is because this is symbolic of people who formally take the Triple Gem and take the precepts. That's the outward view or the outward version of being a Sotapanna. Almost like magically, because somebody's chanting the Pali and you repeat the Pali, you can come up to the standards of the Pali. But really, no, it has to do with changing one's mind and not repeating some Pali verses. So the Triple Gem sounds in the Pali like: Buddham, Saranam, Gacchami, Dhamma, Saranam, Gacchami, Sangham, Saranam, Gacchami. And they do it 3 times, so it's Dukkha, Anpanasati, Buddham, Saranam, Gacchami, Dukkha, Anicca, Dhamma, Saddha, Anagami. So this is actually done in ceremony with everybody chanting along, or in some cases just the monks doing it while the people listen. But many of the people don't even understand what the monks are chanting. So how could this be that the monk is chanting the Triple Gem and people then automatically take the Triple Gem? Oh no, this being able to really take refuge in the Dharma is because you're skilled at it. That most people are just lost at sea, and when they think about taking refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha, that's like they're still caught at sea, but they don't even know how to get into port. To where those who have the Dharma are the ones who know exactly how to get right into port. And so we do take the refuge. It's actually an attitude, the attitude that I do take the Dharma as refuge. Why? Because I can. I know how to get in. I do know without a doubt that this is the path. I know what the path is and know what the path is not. So basically, the way that it states in the suttas— this is actually in one of the suttas, it's in the Sabbha Asepa Sutta number 2, and in Bhikkhu Bodhisattva's translation he's got verse numbers in it, and it's verse 11, and he translates the words as wise attention. Wise attention, when we pay wise attention to the Four Noble Truths, when we pay wise attention to "this is suffering, this is the cause of the suffering," when we pay wise attention to "what does it feel like to be free from dissatisfaction," and when we pay really deep and wise attention to the Eightfold Noble Path, By doing this, it says there that three fetters are eliminated, and then they list them as personality view, doubt, and adherence to right rules and rituals. I mean, this is right there in the Suttas. But the most important part of it is, is that it means that you have to actually practice the Eightfold Noble Path. You actually have to make those changes yourself in order to be able to get out and through all of that, those levels of doubt, so that you could see clearly. That third fetter is knowledge and vision about this is the way I'm going to be living my life now, no doubt about it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, this perspective has solved a lot of problems for me that I've had in my practice for a long time. I had my first kind of big, you know, experience that people have, you know, when that gets you on this path, that when I was 15 and I called myself wandering seeker, you know. And then just today I realized that like, that now that I'm no longer practicing dissatisfaction, I'm practicing satisfaction, I should you know, rename myself like, you know, wandering non-seeker, because it's non-seeking. You know, the seeking is just another form of craving. And you mentioned this to me when I said that when I sit, my mind still wanders. And you said, well, that's just an indication that your mind is still looking for something. I thought to myself, okay, that's my primary issue is I'm in this constant state of seeking. And so the reminder that I'm using is just, "Remember to be satisfied now." You know? And for me, I feel like that kind of gets the whole Eightfold Path working all at once. And then the mind moves straight into that state of satisfaction.

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm. One of the things that almost every student asks when we get to that state is what's next. And when I hear the students say that, that actually indicates that you're not there yet, because when you get there, you don't have that question anymore about what's next, because you've arrived. It's sort of like you want to take an airplane from, oh, two different cities, Mexico City to Paris or whatever like that. And so you go all the way through, getting on the plane, flying and all of that. And when you land, now the question is, well, what's next? And the answer to that is, well, it's not more flying because you've already arrived at where you were going. Or another example of that is The Pilgrim's Progress, which is an old book out of the Middle Ages. And the idea is, is that people would go on pilgrimage, mainly from Europe to the Holy Lands way back when. And the point was, is that once the pilgrim gets to the holy place, what is he going to do? Well, most pilgrims that I know of are going to say, what's next? They're going to pack up their bag and go back on a journey to get to yet another holy site, because I mean, the Holy Lands is full of holy sites. And the pilgrim winds up spending very little time in the holy place and most of the time in traffic on the road going from one holy place to the next. And so this is why we go around asking that question, what's next? And the answer to that obviously is this is it. Stop looking for more. The whole point is, is that we're practicing becoming satisfied with the way things are, and we need to do that enough to where it sinks into a really, really deep level. But while we're satisfied, if we keep having thoughts of being dissatisfied, like what's next? I've got the first Jhana, now what do I do for the second, the third, and the fourth? Well, Man, if you've got the first Jhana, really be satisfied with it. That's the whole point, is we're learning to be satisfied, that we don't need to go off into attainments, that noble is noble, so we don't have to go up the ladder, that will happen almost naturally. The only job that we really have is the effort to stay in a state of satisfaction, to stay in that state, because the satisfaction will naturally grow into a state of success, and that success and satisfaction are really, really closely related. So by practicing being satisfied, we will eventually, sometimes very quickly, Successful. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** I was going to say that the way I kind of illustrate it in my mind is like, in your normal state of suffering, and when you— it's like you see all these weights you're carrying. You first see all these heavy weights you're carrying, and then you practice satisfaction, and you're like, oh, these are heavy weights, and you put them down. But then when the satisfaction gets gets deeper, all of a sudden you're aware that there's like lighter weights that you didn't notice, and like, oh, oh, those are, those are lighter, I didn't notice that, you put those down, and then your satisfaction gets deeper, and then you notice like there's even lighter weights that you're holding, you're like, oh wow, those are, those, I'm gonna put those down too, and it kind of just gets deeper and deeper, and as it gets deeper, you just notice lighter and lighter weights that you're carrying until like basically there's nothing left.

**Speaker A:** While you're, what you're saying is absolutely correct, it's also misleading to call them heavy medium and light weights. And a better way to look at it is the weight of the moment, the weight of this thought. This thought is heavy enough, doesn't— I mean, a heavy thought is a heavy thought at any stage of practice. And so instead of judging the thoughts as too heavy and light, better way to think about it is wholesome and unwholesome. That's the better way of looking at it. It's just, is this thought wholesome or not? And that as we practice on and on, we get really good at figuring out which thoughts are wholesome and which ones are not. And so the ones who would, in the beginning of practice, we thought these are wholesome, good enough. Later in the practice, we'll say, wait a minute, I can do better than that. But that's part of the self, that's part of the acceptance process, that yes, the satisfaction will grow deeper because we're actually going to, uh, let us say, get rid of all of the stuff that makes us unsatisfied. And as we're sitting there satisfied again, we begin to look at what you're calling the more lighter weight things things, to where in fact there are no— there's just more stuff to do, just more. And I could get rid of— I got rid of that stuff before, I could get rid of it again. And so this is the way that we practice. And asking questions about what's next is just meaning that We're not satisfied with the way things are. Let's make a little tweak here and there and get back to where I don't need anything next. This is good enough. But you have arrived, that the pilgrim is in the holy place now. No need to go trotting off to another holy place. This holy place is Holy. It's whole. It's good.

**Speaker B:** And the whole concept of next is a mental birth.

**Speaker A:** That's right. Then that's drilled into us. You could almost say that it came with clocks. You didn't have that kind of mentality. Go ahead, Pedro.

**Speaker C:** Okay, I was saying that the thing with the Sangha is that it's not like other places, because for example, you know, you go to the psychologist and he gives you suggestions, and then for 15 days you're away from the psychologist, and so it's like you have to, you know, you have to remember what he said to you. And so on, and then go back and so on. With the Sangha, it's like that actually there is a physical place where you, you feel good, you know. And if you want to feel better, you actually join the Sangha more. It's not like the psychologist, usually you have to become, to go away from him on a certain point after the.

**Speaker A:** The.

**Speaker C:** Work, you know, the therapy, you have to leave him and go on with your life. It's like, you know, a support. But with the Sangha, the more you feel good, the more you join the Sangha.

**Speaker A:** That's exactly right. In fact, that's the progress. A while ago, I was talking about the first step. Of Srotapanna, which is basically when we talk about path and fruit. And so the path of the Srotapanna is this feeling of success, the feeling of I know that I can clean out my mind, which is also following along with doubt about what is and what is not the right path. So that is in fact the third knowledge. The fourth knowledge is basically The fourth knowledge is it's okay for me to see my own warts. It's okay for me to see all of the things that I used to hate about myself, all of the bad things, that it's okay that we begin to nourish ourselves deeply and love ourselves, warts and all, rather than seeing ourselves as bad and broken and need to be fixed. You're already okay. So you screwed up. Screwing up is fun. Let's have a ball. Okay, that's the way of beginning. See why? Because if we do it that way— well, if we don't do it that way, then we will hide from our warts. We don't like it. We'll lie to ourselves about it. We don't see them clearly enough because we're not supposed to. They break our rules. But when we get rid of our rules, we begin to think, now it's okay to have warts. It's okay to not know. It's okay to be ignorant. It's okay to be all right. Just, you know, we don't have to become perfect. So the next knowledge after that, then the fifth knowledge, is the knowledge that we want the Dharma. We want to hear the Dharma. We become dedicated to the Dharma. Then like a cow who's just had a baby calf, even though she might be eating the grass, she's still got one eye on that calf. So the same is true. We can go around the rest of our day, but we have one eye on the Dharma. We see the Dharma everywhere. We find the Dharma in everything. We're curious about what the suttas have. We want to hear people who were speaking the Dharma. We want to speak the Dharma. Okay, so our whole life becomes wrapped up with the Dharma, which is exactly, Pedro, what you were saying a moment ago. And then the next one, the fifth layer of the Sotapanna, is when it really gets into the fruit. Of Srotapanna, which is no longer the path, but now it's the fruit of it, is when we become really eager for the Dharma, enthusiastic for the Dharma, that the Dharma is about the only thing that we care about. And then the 7th knowledge is when we add a new layer of delight, that we live the Dharma all the time, we're delighted with the Dharma, we're enthusiastic about the Dharma, that we can find those warts and love them dearly.

**Speaker B:** Is that really a state of Dhamma gladness?

**Speaker A:** Dhamma gladness, exactly. That's the state of Srotapanna, along with being completely immersed in the Dharma. Our whole life is now— we're swimming in the Dharma. We're in the path. We're in the stream.

**Speaker B:** That's when you start to sleep a lot less because you want to wake up and you want, you know, you just like kind of like you kind of want to be away all the time almost when you have that Dhamma gladness going.

**Speaker A:** And the funny thing is, is that this is not an attainment. This is not an achievement. This is more like a lifestyle change. But in the Western Dhamma, we've gotten used to having achievements. We've got Sotapanna up there on the wall to check off. We've got this long to-do list, Jhanas and attainments and all of this kind of stuff. And so we look at it in the sense of event orientation. So a student may have a very, very good sitting practice, have a certain kind of good feeling, and then they talk themselves into that this is somehow an attainment. Or they'll go to their Dharma teacher and the Dharma teacher will hear what they have to say about this event, this meditation experience, and then they'll say, "Oh, that means that you've now attained this or that or the other thing." And that's completely Western Buddhism, but that's not anything like what the actual Buddhist teaching is. That we're not after attainments, we're after, in fact, if we can think of it like this, being satisfied without having any attainments.

**Speaker B:** The Dhamma gladness, like for me, like it's like the unwholesome states bubble up, but they're at such a distance you kind of see them like water bubbles coming up and just popping, and then you get this like giggling sensation because there's just like this warm distance between you and those unwholesome states, and you just feel like this sense of like complete freedom because you can just see— you still see your old mind and it's just like bubbling, but it's like so far in the distance. And you're just like, it's like, it's so— it's like joyful to watch all the Anapanasati just bubbling up and dissolving in front of you constantly because it's like before you were inside of it and saying terrible things to people and getting angry and being hard on yourself and feeling stressed and almost like, it's almost like the difference is almost like life and death. You know, you're inside that, it's like you're dead. And when you're outside it, you're like, wow, I've been dead for so many years. Like, I didn't feel like you haven't been breathing for all that time. And so there's like this like bubbling joy, just like feeling so free when it's just at that distance. Well, and then that, that for me, the way that I, because I had that for a long time, the way I lost it was that I got complacent with it. I was like, wow, this is like totally permanent. I never I don't have to worry about anything again. And then like something happened that made me just, you know, I got too complacent thinking that that was just like gonna take care of itself. I wasn't gonna have to like watch it anymore.

**Speaker A:** That's the major problem with attainment. We think that once we've got it, we own it. And the Buddha keeps harping on everything is temporary. Everything is temporary. You've got to put in a brand new effort right now. This effort's a whole lot easier than the last effort because we've gotten skilled at putting in right effort, but we still have to keep putting in the effort over and over again.

**Speaker B:** It lasted a good couple of years, but it was still impermanent. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So if we can come to the point of recognizing that all we've got is this moment, there are no attainments. That everything is either you're a victim right now or you're the winner. Or as one student said, he gave me this analogy. He says that everyone, every human being, is an emperor of their own pile of dirt. The question is, are you going to be buried under your own pile of dirt, crawling your way out of your own pile of dirt, or just sitting happily on top of your pile of dirt. Sitting happily on top of the pile of dirt is the lokottara. That's the super mundane. That's the noble. Being buried under the pile of dirt, that's totally the victim, buried under their own circumstances. And then clawing our way out of it is the beginner's attitude. That I've got to get out of it, to where in fact the easy way is to just float right to the top. See, to change your attitude, that you don't have to claw your way out of your own pile of crap. You can just love yourself for it, enjoy the fact that you've got a.

**Speaker B:** Perch.

**Speaker A:** That we need to accept ourselves, warts and all, the way that we are. That's okay, because then we can see clearly what we used to think was not okay and would hide from. The easy example of that is two guys are fighting.

**Speaker B:** It's almost like— Go ahead. I was gonna say it almost feels like, like, like all the mental energies are scattered all over the place. And then when you collect it, when you collect it all, so much consciousness just comes into the present moment that those mental, those unwholesome states begin becomes so tiny and so weak that they're just comical, you know, like the idea of being caught in them becomes like, it just becomes entertaining to watch the mind go through its patterns because it's so removed. You're so removed from it that it's doing, the brain's basically doing the same thing it's been doing, but it's like at such a distance that and you're just, you have so much awareness that it feels like it's at a distance. It's like the way that time slows down, but like the unwholesome states grow distant, you know, so there's like a different sense of time and space from that, from that collectedness, that mental energy.

**Speaker A:** Yes, you were mentioning about the bubbles, and that gives rise to the idea of, imagine that you have a mother, who has a fairly young child, and that when she sees the child misbehave, she says something like, "Aha, I caught you. Aha, I can see that." And she treats the child in a nurturing way. Now you can transpose that to a mother who sees the same child, or sees her child at a similar age, and she says something like, I told you not to do that, and here you are doing it again. Okay, so we pick that kind of stuff up as a child. We pick up the critical, and we don't— and we lose track of the nurturing. So in the Buddha's reference, would— aha, I see you, Mara. Aha, I see you, bubbles. Aha, I see you, bad behavior. In a very nurturing, loving way. To just accept ourselves the way that we are, because in that acceptance, in that joy, in that transformation into being a nurturing being, those bad behaviors kind of take care of themselves. Aha, I see you, and then we don't do it anymore.

**Speaker B:** I like that.

**Speaker A:** And so, well, you've already come to that point when you're just seeing those sayings, that they're just bubbles.

**Speaker B:** Also, you know, um, anyway, and yeah, I just like, I enjoy the hell out of him, you know, and like, I don't, I don't react negatively or stress out at all with his his toddler energy, or his— what if he cries or something? But I see a lot of people who are parents who are like tired and aggravated all the time, and they're just like in that struggle with their young kids. So from like a psychological perspective, like what you're saying, if you take the parent perspective and you become the nurturing parent, it also gives you more freedom. It gives like the child ego and the parent ego ego both a sense of joy because the relationship is no longer contentious. It's now like nurturing and joyful and fun, you know. And you can think of that as the relationship between like your awareness and your unwholesome states. Like, you know, if you're nurturing to them, then there's no longer tension that's being created every time they come up. You're just kind of like having fun, just seeing them as they are, you know. That's their nature. Like a toddler's nature is to cry every once in a while. The mind's nature is to create unwholesome states every once in a while. So nurture it and have fun with it and play with it, you know, instead of getting angry and frustrated every time an unwholesome state comes up, because that's just what the mind does, you know.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it's like the difference between embracing it with awareness or like trying to control it with the mind without knowing that the mind also acts out of, let's say, unconsciousness. So you're like trying to control with unconsciousness, like, why you don't behave like I told you? But the other way is like embracing with awareness, you know, just.

**Speaker A:** Uh, uh.

**Speaker C:** Look it with the light of awareness that it's like a a comfortable space where the things happen, you know, and yeah, in this awareness-like environment where there is space also for the child to recognize eventually the behavior and so on.

**Speaker B:** And the bad behavior doesn't really go on for very long when you don't react angrily with anger. It dissolves much more quickly.

**Speaker A:** Well, bad behavior is almost always a reaction to bad behavior, and when you break the cycle, yeah, the bad behavior kind of breaks down.

**Speaker B:** It's a different way of looking at unwholesome thoughts, you know. If I look at them like the way I look at my toddler, then I can love them a lot more easily, I think.

**Speaker A:** So going through the example that Freud and later Eric Berne gave of the id to superego the superego and the ego, or as Berne talks about it, the adult and the child, we can see that the parent has become a critical parent with all of these rules, the sivabhata paramasa, and that the child within each one of us then responds and sometimes rebels against the rules, that we rebel against that. When we change that into nurturing, then the child will feel more relaxed, more nurtured, and more whole. And so here is where the three fetters come in precisely. The superego is the Silabatta Paramasa, the second fetter, and the child is the personality that is being told by the superego he can't change, to where in fact the child knows that he can change. And then the adult, or the frontal cortex, or the wisdom part of us, then comes in the knowledge and the vision of how to do this. The knowledge and vision of what is and is not the bad is to be nurturing between the parent and the child within. And this is what then unifies and brings the mind into a state of Samadhi, are into unification is when we're not critical with ourselves, when we're accepting, when we're loving ourselves, warts and all. We feel champion, and we also feel through wisdom that we've got what we need. We've got the path. We know what we need to do for the rest of our lives is just to take care of myself. Taking care Samadhi.

**Speaker B:** Is like an harmonious family.

**Speaker A:** Right. Instead, what we do is we care about all kinds of things, and by caring about things, we carry them around. This is what the Buddha uses in the word of clinging. We cling to all kinds of things, to where the only thing that's really worth clinging to is this present moment, happily clinging to that unification of mind. That's what's the only thing that's worth caring about then, is giving ourselves a break, enjoying the moment, being free from wanting things that we don't have. And that's the whole teaching of the Buddha right there. Many people think that it's highfalutin, that it's magical, that you're on cloud nine or whatever like that. And the answer is, no, you're just a human being, but you will love it. Warts and all.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, one thing that helps me is like to remind myself also that I already decide to change it all, you know, like when some moment of maybe discouraging or something, it's like, no, no, no, because the the choice. I already did it, you know, there's no way back. And I have to let the things flow and remember to look as the unwolesome vanishes little by little, and I nourish the also, you know, like I remind myself that it's already the case.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's the way of looking at it. Hey, it's already okay. Well guys, let's finish now. This has been a good talk. I've really enjoyed this. Um, before I go though, Pedro, um, I have a— I have kind of a plan for the two of us to do something tomorrow. So give me a call tomorrow and I'll tell you all about it, okay?

**Speaker C:** Right, yes, okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** Michael, it was so good to see you again. I really enjoy our conversation.

**Speaker C:** Hey Michael, great to meet you.

**Speaker B:** Good to meet you too, Pietro.

**Speaker A:** Yes, you both got new friends now.

**Speaker B:** Okay, wonderful.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay, okay. Alrighty, bye-bye. Okay, have a good day.

**Speaker B:** Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends Michael (Speaker B) and Pedro (Speaker C), focuses on the practical dismantling of the **"lower three fetters"**—a core Buddhist concept for stream-entry (*sotāpanna*). The conversation is a dynamic exploration of how these fetters manifest in daily life and how to overcome them through attitude and practice.

Here is a structured summary of the key points:

### Core Theme: The Freedom to Change
The central, recurring insight is that **the most significant barrier to progress is the belief that we cannot change.** The entire talk revolves around recognizing and overcoming this fixed, victim mentality.

### 1. The Three Fetters Explained Practically
*   **Identity View (Personality Belief):** The fetter of seeing oneself as a fixed entity ("I am an anxious person," "I have ADHD," "Boys will be boys"). This self-labeling restricts growth and becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
*   **Attachment to Rites and Rituals (Sīlabbata-parāmāsa):** The blind adherence to external rules, conventions, and "supposed to's" (social norms, religious dogmas, cultural scripts) that reinforce the fixed identity. The two fetters are deeply linked: our identity is often constructed from the rules we've internalized.
*   **Doubt (Vicikicchā):** Not just intellectual uncertainty, but a deep-seated **victim's doubt** in three layers:
    1.  "I need external help to change" (a savior, teacher, pill).
    2.  "Even if I must do it myself, am I capable?"
    3.  "What is the true path?" This is overcome by **"knowledge and vision of what is and is not the path,"** leading to unwavering confidence in the Dhamma as the way.

### 2. The Antidote: Cultivating a "Winner's Attitude"
The practical method to break these fetters is to cultivate a **nurturing, "winner's attitude"** toward oneself in the present moment.
*   **Precedes Everything:** This attitude acts as a precondition that filters perception and determines the direction of thoughts *before* they proliferate (analogized to chopping a tree so it falls in the desired direction).
*   **Replaces the Critic:** It swaps the internal **critical parent** (which enforces rigid rules and creates a rebellious/defeated child) with a **nurturing parent**. One learns to say "Aha, I see you, Mara" with love, not judgment.
*   **Focus on Satisfaction:** The core practice is **learning to be satisfied now**. Seeking ("What's next?") is a form of craving. The goal is to "arrive" and be content in the present, which allows wisdom and happiness to deepen naturally.

### 3. Practical Applications & Insights
*   **Education:** Linked to the "growth mindset" vs. "fixed mindset" model. Praise and nurturing language can break the fixed identity early.
*   **Mental Health:** Diagnostic labels (e.g., ADHD) can become limiting identity views. The emphasis is on seeing the human mind as dynamic and changeable.
*   **Parenting:** The relationship with one's own unwholesome states should be like a nurturing parent with a toddler—observing with loving awareness, not angry control. This dissolves tension and shortens the life of negative states.
*   **Path vs. Fruit:** Progress is framed not as a ladder of attainments to grasp, but as a **lifestyle change** and a deepening of **Dhamma gladness**. It's about swimming in the Dhamma, not checking off achievements.

### 4. The Result: Stream-Entry and the Triple Gem
By eroding the three fetters through this practice, one naturally embodies the **Three Refuges**:
*   **Buddha:** Confidence that freedom from *dukkha* (suffering/stress) is possible.
*   **Dhamma:** Unshakable knowledge that the Eightfold Path is the way.
*   **Sangha:** Valuing and connecting with noble friends on the same path.

The talk concludes by emphasizing that a unified, harmonious mind (**Samadhi**) comes from this internal family of nurturing parent, contented child, and wise adult working together—**accepting oneself, "warts and all,"** and clinging only to the wholesome satisfaction of the present moment.

**In essence:** The talk is a powerful guide to transforming one's life by rejecting the lie of a fixed self, abandoning blind adherence to external rules, and replacing doubt with a self-nurturing attitude of present-moment satisfaction, thereby entering the stream of the Dhamma.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **The Falling Tree:** Thoughts are compared to a tree being cut down. The direction it falls (the nature and impact of the thought) is determined by the initial cuts (our **attitude**). A skilled cutter (a mindful person) directs it safely; an unskilled one causes damage (unwholesome thoughts causing suffering).
2.  **The Spinning Wheel / Planetary Orbit:** Once a wheel is set spinning or a planet orbiting, it continues in that direction. This illustrates how mental proliferation (**papanca**) gains momentum based on our initial attitude or "lean." The metaphor is extended to show that "clockwise" or "counterclockwise" is a matter of **perspective**, which we can change, just like we can change our attitude.
3.  **Pile of Dirt:** Every person is an emperor of their own pile of dirt (their life, mind, karma). The key question is: are you **buried under it** (victim), **clawing your way out** (struggling beginner), or **sitting happily on top** (noble, satisfied)? The path is about learning to float to the top, not struggle.
4.  **Bubbles:** Unwholesome states or habits are likened to bubbles rising and popping. From a state of collected awareness (**samadhi**), they are seen at a distance, as tiny, weak, and even comical—they lose their power to entangle.
5.  **The Mother and the Child:** The relationship between awareness and unwholesome mental states is compared to a mother with a misbehaving toddler. The critical mother ("I told you not to do that!") creates tension. The nurturing, observant mother ("Aha, I see you doing that") accepts the behavior with loving awareness, allowing it to dissipate naturally. This reframes practice from combat to nurturing observation.
6.  **The Cow and Calf:** A cow that has just given birth, while grazing, always keeps one eye on her calf. This illustrates the fifth knowledge of a **sotāpanna** ("stream-enterer"): even while engaged in daily life, one's attention is always partly on the Dhamma.
7.  **Gathering in the Grocery Store:** The modern mind's tendency to seek endless knowledge and ask endless questions is compared to going to the store for milk but coming out with a full cart. This "gathering" instinct is a form of craving that hinders settling into satisfied practice.
8.  **Safe Harbor / Home Port:** The Dhamma (or the noble mind) is compared to a safe harbor. While one may have to go out into the "high seas" of life, one can always return quickly to this place of safety and refuge.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **The Light Bulb Joke:** Adapted to Dharma teachers: "How many Dharma teachers does it take to change a light bulb? One, but the light bulb really has to want to change." This humorously underscores the core point: **the individual must realize they themselves have the power and responsibility to change**; a teacher can't do it for them.
2.  **Mrs. Brown and the "Outstanding":** Speaker A shares a personal story about a second-grade teacher, Mrs. Brown, who gave him an "outstanding" grade. This single instance of praise and recognition broke a "fixed mindset" early on and set him on a path toward mathematics, illustrating how early **nurturing** (vs. criticism) can fundamentally shape one's attitude and potential.
3.  **The Pilgrim's Progress:** Referencing the classic allegory, the speaker critiques the perpetual seeker mentality. The pilgrim spends all their time *traveling between* holy sites (seeking the next attainment, the next answer) but never truly *stays* in the holy place (the present moment of satisfaction). The moral is: "You have arrived. Stop looking for 'what's next?'"
4.  **Rehabilitating Wild Animals:** Society cares for injured wild animals (birds with broken wings, orphaned babies) with the explicit goal of releasing them back into independence. In contrast, **human society** is described as conditioning people to remain perpetual **dependents** and **victims** (needing a job, a savior, a teacher, a pill), never teaching or allowing true psychological independence.

### **Recurring Conceptual Analogies**
*   **Fixed vs. Growth Mindset:** Directly referenced from educational theory, used to explain the fetter of identity view ("I can't change, that's who I am").
*   **Win-Lose (Zero-Sum) vs. Win-Win:** Used to describe the underlying attitude of conservatism/rigidity (win-lose) versus the noble attitude (win-win) that seeks satisfaction without needing others to lose.
*   **The Nurturing Parent vs. The Critical Parent (from Transactional Analysis):** This psychological model is used to explain the fetters. The **critical parent** is the set of rigid rules (**silabbata paramasa**). The **child** is the conditioned personality (**sakkaya-ditthi**) told it cannot change. The path involves the **adult** (wise awareness) fostering a **nurturing parent** attitude to heal the internal conflict and unify the mind.

**Overall Theme:** The metaphors and stories consistently serve to demystify deep Buddhist concepts (fetters, attitude, right view) by linking them to tangible, everyday images and experiences. They emphasize **agency**, the **power of perspective**, and the shift from a critical, seeking struggle to a nurturing, satisfied acceptance.
