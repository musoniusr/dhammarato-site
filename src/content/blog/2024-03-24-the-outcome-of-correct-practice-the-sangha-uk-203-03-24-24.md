### Transcript


**Speaker A:** And so, welcome to the Sunday Sangha, the UK call. Oh, I'm Red, glad you joined us. Yes, so, Deidre has asked to talk about generosity. And so, everyone is invited to comment, to break in, to raise their hand. This is a community chat, it's not a lecture. Okay, it's like a— think of it as like a classroom where all the kids are throwing spitballs at the teacher while he's talking. So the first thing that we can talk about again would be correct practice. That generosity is in fact an outcome of correct practice. Just like Metta, that you can think of Metta and many of the attributes— generosity, gratitude, immense joy, a feeling of wealth and pleasure— all of these are the outcomes of correct practice. And so, if we can learn to practice correctly, these will become the outcomes. So let's make sure that we can talk about what is correct practice, and that the correct practice then would be from the position of the Eightfold Noble Path, that is actually part of the Four Noble Truths, which is the primary teaching of the Buddha. That in fact, if the Buddha has said that he has only one teaching, and that teaching is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, which means the word Dukkha actually is translated very well as dissatisfaction. It is often translated in the suttas and spoken of but in fact for many years I was in the habit of using the word suffering. But if we consider the teachings of the Buddha about suffering, then we miss the point, because suffering is actually an outcome of no practice at all. So, if we don't have any practice at all, then we are completely dissatisfied, and while we're dissatisfied, we're not watching where we go, and while we're not watching where we're going, we wind up in a thicket, brambles, briars. Don't throw me in that briar patch, but that's where people wind up. But in fact, the Dukkha is immense displeasure. And that what we're looking for in our practice is to not find all of that immense heavy-duty big stuff, but rather the little dissatisfactions that we have right here in this present moment. That a lot of meditation practitioners think that they have to go deep into meditation because the problems they have are deep, but in fact they're not. You don't even— if things in fact, if all of the really heavy-duty problems were deep, then that means you'd never have to deal with them. They're buried. They're like a corpse. It's very deep. It doesn't come back up and haunt you. But if it does come back up and haunt you, there it is. It's not deep anymore. It's right in front of you. And so this is what we're going to be dealing with, is to deal with the dissatisfactions and discomforts that we have in this present moment. And the whole practice then is based upon having the right view that we can change. The right view is that we can see what's going on And then all we have to do is to remember to look. And once we remember to look and see what's really there— our dissatisfactions, for example— then we can change them. If you can't see what the problem is, you have a hard time fixing it. But if you can see the problem, then it's easy to fix. It's sort of like a toy horse that's sitting on its side. All you have to do is just set it upright. That's all that's necessary, is to see what's, uh, wonky-jawed or, uh, on its side or upside down and set it right. In fact, this is something that I found in the, in the sutras quite often. Is that lay people from all over the place would come and ask the Buddha questions, and he would answer those questions in a simple way, and they would then respond with, "Wow, you have set things right, that before things were laying on their side, and you showed us how to set things up correctly." This is really what the Buddhist teaching of the Eightfold Noble Path is all about, is to recognize what's 'wompy-jawed,' to recognize what's unwholesome, to recognize the things that are unsatisfactory, dissatisfying, and set them right. Now, the place to begin would be with the mind, but in fact we have four items that we have to work with. With, 4 things that get wumpy-jawed: the body, the feelings, our mental states and attitudes, and our thoughts. These are the 4 primary points of the original elements, in fact, in the time of the Buddha. They had it as the 4 elements; now we have 94 and counting. But in those days, they had only 4 elements: solid things, liquid things, fire, and smoke. Those were the 4 things that they had. But we can see that that's exactly what we have. We have the body, we have all of the fluids and all of the chemicals that are racing around the body that gives various sensations that we would call feelings. Touch, taste, smell, feeling bad, feeling guilty, all of that, which basically is feeling fear. And then we have the attitude of mind, or the state of mind that we're in, and that's normally the state of being a victim. We were born as victims, we were raised as victims, we were taught to be victims. Then in fact, I just talked to Ross the other day And he was almost overwhelmed. He was blown away by the fact that he is teaching his children the way that he was taught to hate school. He didn't like school, and so he's taught his children to hate school. They got to go to school, and so they go, they do what they're told to do, but they don't like it. Well, we actually spend our whole lives as victims going around doing what we think that we have to do, the things that we were told to do, and we don't like it. So basically what we have is the right practice of the Eightfold Noble Path, is to recognize that we don't like what we're doing, and we can make a change to that. That you're going to do what you're going to do, why don't you do it and like it? Why do you have to do it and not like it? We can't change what we have to do, but we can certainly change the way we feel about it. And I imagine that kids would do a whole lot better, for instance, in school, if they liked it. In fact, the students who like music will practice it and become good musicians. The kids that liked math study it, and get very good at it. And the kids who don't like math are the ones who never wind up being any good about it. And here we have all of this stuff in our society about, "Life is tough, life is hard, life is difficult, life sucks." The point is, is that life is marvelous. I mean, don't you all enjoy being alive? You're alive. Don't you prefer that? Is anybody here ready to croak? I mean, slit your throat right in front of the rest of us, give us something to watch. Nobody's willing to do that. We all want to stay alive. It's actually instinctual. The self-preservation instinct wants to keep us alive. So why don't we enjoy being alive? The answer to that is because we've been trained to not like doing what we're doing. And so, the whole point of correct practice is to turn that around, to start liking what we're doing. An example of that is that almost all negative emotions, in fact all negative emotions, are based upon the one point of fear. People who are angry are afraid. They're being under attack, and so they attack back. A good offense is the best defense, so they've heard. And so when they feel under attack, they attack back. If you were not under attack, there's no reason to attack back. Also, the feeling of frustration, worry, doubt, guilt, grief, all of those feelings that we come across from time to time, the underlying feeling is the feeling of fear. And so what we can actually start to practice is to change the way that we feel by talking about it in a way that changes our attitude, because fear or Anapanasati, because of the attitude that things are dangerous. And the attitude that things are dangerous means I'm not up to the task, which goes back to the point about being a victim. So victimization and feeling victim and feeling like that things are bigger than you are, or that you don't like to do it, always then has a quality of fear built into it. Hello, Ivan. Wow, we got a crowd today, 11 or 12 of us here. So if we can start to practice, one of the things that we're going to practice correctly is to recognize that when we get away from other people and get into seclusion— and right now most everyone is secluded, or at least on a safe place I think the guys who are not secluded but are here on the porch, they at least think that the porch is a safe place. And that's an important point, is that we have to get in a safe place so that the body can feel safe. I would not recommend that you practice Anapanasati in a prison, but if you're in a prison, that's the place to do it. But do it privately. It's not a good idea to practice in a courtroom, or to practice in a law firm, or to practice in the police department office. It's better to get away from it all. But the funny thing is, is that when we get away from it all, and sit down in our quiet, we wind up realizing that we brought it with us after all. So we actually have to get into seclusion twice. Once from the real one, and then the other one is the mental, that we can seclude ourselves from the reality by getting away. And now we're going to seclude ourselves from the crap that we called reality that we've got on our mind. And when we do that, we can start talking about gladdening the mind, getting the mind in a good state. Having thoughts that gladden the mind. And when I'm saying gladdening the mind, I'm talking about state of mind, that we actually begin to change our state of mind coming out of the victim. And a lot of people practice Anapanasati meditation, I suppose, feeling like they're a victim to it. Oh, meditation is so hard. Oh, the monkey mind just wanders away. And what they're actually practicing then is being a victim. Now they're practicing being a victim to meditation. So what we have to do is be very mindful, very careful to really inspect, to find out that we in fact, while we're thinking that we're practicing correctly, we wind up practicing unwholesome things. So pay close attention. To having the thoughts positive, wholesome, beneficial. Everything is okay, everything is fine, not a worry in the world. Wow, we're safe here. Everybody on this call, does everybody feel safe? I meant, do you feel safe? David, do you feel safe? You're at the what? Ivan, do you feel safe? Martin, do you feel safe? David, do you feel safe? Deidre, do you feel safe? This is the whole idea, is that we practice feeling safe, making sure that we remember that we're safe. We're safe, we're secure, there's no reason to have fear. So when fear or anxiety— and a lot of students will come and say, "Oh, when I practice meditation, I feel anxiety." What they're really saying is that when I'm in meditation, I'm actually beginning to experience the anxiety that I carry around most of the time. And if you can find the anxiety, recognize that in that moment you're probably having unwholesome thoughts that bring up that anxiety again, because if you're having wholesome thoughts, especially the wholesome thought of everything's okay, everything is fine, not a worry in the world, everything's going to be all right. And we keep practicing that way, practicing I feel safe, I'm comfortable. And if we keep practicing that way, the mental attitude of that victim will begin to shift from not being a victim anymore to actually being a winner, being on top of your world. Everyone is an emperor of their own pile of dirt. Are you the emperor that's drowning under your pile of dirt? Are you the emperor that's struggling to try to claw your way out of the pile of dirt? Are you just sitting on top of the world? Sitting on top of your pile of dirt, happy and successful. This is what we need to practice, is to practice feeling like we've got it made. This, in fact, is what begins to generate that feeling of well-being, a sense of well-being, a sense of everything is okay, a sense of I can handle anything that comes by, anything that happens. I handled it before I had it, I can handle it while I've got it, and when it goes away, I can handle it when it says goodbye. Whatever's going on, we can handle it, we can take care of it. There is no reason to fear anything. There is nothing that can happen that's bigger or better than I am. That you become the king of your own life. All right, so how do we get to that state? Is by practice, practice over and over and over again. I feel safe, I feel secure, I feel comfortable, I feel satisfied. Now, this satisfaction means just enough. It's not a superlative. Let's look at it from the sense of the middle path for a moment. The past is on one extreme, the future is on the other, right here, right now is the middle path, in the middle. Also, feeling very, very bad is one extreme, and feeling exalted and marvelous is another extreme. And all we're looking for is a sweet spot in the middle. Everything's okay, everything is fine. And from time to time we have that exalted state. That exalted state comes from the form of, wow, I really can handle this. Well, things really are going to be my way for the rest of my life. Hot diggity dog, I can handle this thing. But that just calms back down into a steady state of, oh wow, everything is so nice. Just relaxed. All right, this begins to bring that sense then of wealth. So somebody's got their microphone on and I'm hearing an echo. David, you turned it back on, didn't you?

**Speaker B:** Uh-huh.

**Speaker A:** All right, so that whole feeling of wealth, the feeling that you've got everything that you need Anybody who comes to you that needs something, you've got a ton of it to give them, especially joy. Why? Because you're so full of it. You're absolutely full of joy. You've become delighted with the Dharma. You become eager for reality. You enjoy being alive. You play with your breath. Oh wow, what a nice breath this is. You begin to see that you actually do live in reality, and reality is quite nice. You can even label it as a paradise. We live in a paradise. David, do you— at what kowtum is that? Not a paradise?

**Speaker C:** Definitely.

**Speaker A:** Michael? How about you? Are this porch— is that a paradise or what? Oh yeah. How about you, David? Do you find you— in fact, you've already mentioned that this island is like a paradise.

**Speaker D:** It is absolutely a paradise.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, yes. But it's a mental attitude. There are people on this island who think this place is a hellhole. They're out there paving this paradise and putting up another bungalow. They're trying to make money off the place, and it's okay just the way it is. In fact, I'll share this with you, that the first time that I ever came to this island was before I was a monk in 1984. After I was a monk, I spent a lot of time on this island, both at Arahant, and at Wat Khao Tom, and in other places like that. And then I was away from it for many, many years, and I come back to Koh Phangan with the impression that, wow, there's a whole lot of people who tried to screw up this paradise and they weren't able to do it. It's still a paradise. They put in roads, they put in ports, they even tried to put in an airport, and they all managed to fail at screwing this place up. It's still a paradise. So this is a mental attitude that you can take on, that wherever you are is a paradise and you're the king of your own world. That gives you a sense of accomplishment, a sense of everything is okay, you've got it made. All right, so now let's bring in some of these other attributes that you hear associated with Buddhism. An example of that would be Metta, or the Four Brahma Viharas. You probably heard somewhere the statement, "May all beings be happy." Guess what? Only a victim will say that. That's something that victims say. "May all beings be happy, especially me. Oh, I want to be happy too." It also is future-oriented, and you don't even know how long it's going to take for all of those people to be happy, and we want everybody to be happy so they'll be good to me and I don't have to worry anymore. Well, guess what? All of those people are not going to be happy, but we can be happy. We don't need for them to be happy. But in fact, I have heard, maybe you have, that there's a thing called a Bodhisattva vow that comes from the Mahayana, which has the vow is that everybody is going to have to go in through the gate, and I'll be the last one there, and then I'll find it when everybody is enlightened, then I'll become enlightened too. Guess what? How many people have taken that Bodhisattva vow? 10,000? 100,000? And they're outside the gate all fighting with each other. No, you go in! I have vowed you got to go in before I go in. And so they're out there fist fighting over who they can throw in before, so that they could be the last one in. And one of the things that's really remarkable about that is that it's a swinging door. The door goes both ways. It's open to you to go in anytime you want, and it's open to come right back out again in case you want to grab somebody by the heels and bring them back in with.

**Speaker B:** You.

**Speaker A:** So, you're the boss now. You don't have to say, "I'm a victim of this gate. Once I go in, I can't get back out." Oh no, you can come back out and help people if you want to. So, this idea of Metta is really an attitude that is the outcome of the correct practice that we've just been talking about. It's not a practice. People who practice Metta don't wind up having much Metta to share, but those who have come on top of the world, they've got loads of Metta for other people. Great big smiles all around. Now the next one that you were actually asking about, and this is probably the time to start mentioning it, we were talking about generosity. Well, generosity actually is easy to come by if you have something to give. But if you're a tightwad, wherever— now, much— let's talk about money for a moment. Never mind how much money you have, if you have the attitude that it's not enough, then you're going to be a tightwad with it. Other people will have the attitude of, oh, I can spend that money and get away with it. It is not going to come back on me. But the real attitude is that I've got more money than I need. I don't need anything. I don't have to spend it. Just let the money roll in and I don't have to spend it. I'll give it away instead. That's the idea to have. So If the brother or a good friend— Alexander, can you turn your mic off because you've got some background noise there? If somebody comes in to borrow money, let's say a brother or a cousin comes in and says, I need $500. If you mull that over and you mentally check your account and you mentally check your bank book and your wallet and you say, oh, I don't have the money, then guess what? Now we have two people, you and him, that are unhappy, dissatisfied, hurting. And in fact, he may be suffering, but you're broke according to your own mind. But if you say instead, oh yeah, I can loan you $500, Yeah, there's no problem. Then guess what? He feels good and happy because he gets the money he needs. But I feel happy because I feel wealthy enough to let the money go. So it's your choice. That's the way that we handle generosity, is recognizing that you get the benefit. You're the one who, by giving, has the greater benefit. Yes, go ahead, Alexander.

**Speaker E:** Can I share an experience that just happened to me like an hour ago about generosity? And I guess also a Dukkha in the practice. So, yeah, an hour ago, so currently I'm in Mumbai, and an hour ago I went outside to get some snacks, and while waiting, and a young girl just came and begged for food. So naturally I paid for her some food and drinks, which for me was natural to do. And I mean, she was quite young, I guess around 10 years old, and on her face you could see like she got through tough time. So yeah, whatever, it's quite common in India, especially in Mumbai. So I went back to my hostel and having my lunch. And yeah, this girl just kept on my mind, which might be the mistake, I don't know. So I was thinking about her and the misery of what was about her life. And I went in my room, I mean, on my bed to practice 15 minutes. And my thoughts were most of them about this girl, you know, and the misery that might be her life. At the end of my practice, after 15 minutes, I just felt sadness rising, which I guess was still okay, and some tears coming too. So the first thing that I did is just observing. Now I was trying to broaden the mind, so okay, I'm okay, it's fine, I'm okay. But at some point I felt like it wasn't much working. I just needed to watch what's going on and just let it go. And that's the thing that I'm kind of struggling about what you're saying, because like I cannot change her life, you know, like just giving money or food won't change her life, you know, and she will still be in this state. And even if I'm good right here, right now with myself, and I'm happy, and I can let go of this sadness, there's still someone that I've you know, met for like a few moments, that is still struggling. And so, yeah, it's, you know, my action was based on generosity, it was fine, but I still went through like sadness and depression, you know. Even if I just— [Speaker:DHAMMARATO] And you.

**Speaker A:** Could have felt good instead if you had only thought that, "Hey, wasn't it marvelous that somebody smiled?" Wasn't it marvelous that I was being joyful, but instead you decided to be unhappy?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, because those shots, yeah, that's what my shots, but it's just, you know, there's someone that, I mean, I couldn't gladden my state much more than, "Oh, I'm okay, but this person is not okay." You know, like, it's so— But they.

**Speaker A:** Were happy when you gave them the food, right?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** You could see their joy. In this moment. Okay, but you decided that, oh, they're going to feel bad later, therefore I'll feel bad later too. Yeah, yeah, rather than staying with the joy of the moment.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, yeah, that's why I said earlier, like, my thought kept on being on this girl from the past, so that was, you know, the mistake, I guess. But it just You know, sometimes gladdening the mind, having all this misery around. I mean, I'm aware of being gladdening and feeling like in a paradise, whatever your environment. And I believe it's the best way to act, especially if you're in contact with people. But yeah, when it's all the time on and on and on, sometimes I feel it might be a little bit hypocrite. You know, like to pladden all the time.

**Speaker A:** All right, can you turn your mic off so that Dietrich, she's got her hand up and she wants to talk.

**Speaker E:** Okay, right.

**Speaker A:** Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** I really recognize what you're saying, Alexandra, but it reminds me of a talk I think 2 weeks ago where we were— Dhammarato really cleared out that you cannot say you're not the person to save others. You're not to save the world. You are on your own, actually. You can only fix yourself. You cannot fix anybody else. But in the moment, you can always offer a smile and offer something you have to offer. You can never take on the whole world. You know, there was also in this Sangha was a picture of Before Dharma, you see Atlas with the whole world on his back. After Dharma, you see just the world. That's really interesting because I really relate to what you say. I know I always have this rescuing identity. I have to rescue the world, I have to rescue people. But actually, it's so liberating to think there's only one person I can fix, and it's me.

**Speaker A:** Yes. And when you are fixed, in that moment, you have the joy. Now, here's something that's very interesting. You were talking about in India, there's a lot of poverty. But when we use the word poor and poverty, we almost always think about resources, money, etc. The real problem with humanity is that they are poor in spirit. And that you actually cheered someone up, you gave them what they needed in that moment, and you were able to spread joy, and you could have capitalized on that right then and there. And in fact, one of the things that I want to point out about generosity is that in Christianity, Partly because of the Golden Rule. You've heard the Golden Rule of do unto others the way you want them to do unto you. But that's not Buddhist at all. Let me give you an example. It's Christmas time, and the husband gives C-SPAN and a pair of panties to his wife, and she gives him a dishwasher and pots and pans. Right? Neither one of them are happy because they didn't get what they wanted. They gave somebody else what they wanted. This is in fact what proselytizing in Christianity is all about. And within Buddhism, we do not proselytize. When somebody is hungry, we do not sell them or give them the Dharma, we give them what they need in that moment. In fact, that's what the job of a teacher is, to give people what they need. When they come to ask a question, oftentimes it's important for the teacher to listen to the words they're saying, and then attack those words. Listen to what you're saying. You came here to get the Dharma. Listen to when you're using unwholesome language right here and there. But if you do it with an attitude that they feel criticized, then they're not going to get any benefit out of it. Whether you can give them the gift that they need, and that would be inspiration or insight— oh yeah, that's right, I see what you're talking about. So, always when we give a gift, we give a gift of what someone needs, not what we think they need. Which means that we have to work a little bit extra, we have to put in even more right effort, and that is to figure out what is the right thing to give this person right here, right now. But there's an easy way. Out, and that is always that a smile is the best gift. Reader's Digest claims that laughter is the best medicine. So, give people your joy. You don't have to give them the Dhamma. Give them your joy. This is what we're meaning by being generous. Is because one thing is for sure, everybody wants joy. Now, I've actually heard that when somebody is angry and you're joyful around them, that's really going to piss them off even more. But not for a long time. You keep staying happy with them no matter how angry and frustrated they are. They'll begin to start smiling too. They'll see the absurdity of their own anger, and they'll come out of it, if you've survived. So, be careful about how angry you let people become with your joy. But always work with joyfulness. This is the best gift that you can give. Why? Because if you've got plenty of joy, You could give it all away and you still got a ton of it. You can give the whole world joy, but let me remind you that the world— may all beings be happy and all of that— that's a concept. It's not real. What we can do instead is give the joy to the people who are in our little world. The people that you meet, the people that you're around, the people who are in other houses on the other side of town, you can't help them. They don't want your help anyway. There's no reason to go knock on their door and give them a Buddhist pamphlet and a smile. You can only deal with the people around you. That's your world, the world that you encounter, the world that you're in. Your environment, your paradise, only goes about 10 or 20 feet in some cases, or 50 meters at kind of at the extreme. And so when you think of 'may all beings be happy,' start naming them. May all beings be happy. May Dietrich be happy. May Michael be happy. May Danny or David be happy. Both Davids. Right here, right now, when you're around people, those are the people that you spread joy to. The people that are in your mind is just a concept that in fact is unwholesome to wish people well when they're not right in front of you. You're wasting your time and your effort And not only that, but you've got a tinge of sadness, you've got your own discomfort, you've got your own Dukkha, because you want them to be better than they are, instead of recognizing, "Hey man, everybody's okay, they just don't know it yet, but everybody's all right, everybody's fine." That's the kind of Metta that we want to spread, is the kind of spread to where everything is already okay. No Dukkha here. So, back to the point about the practice. Go ahead, Dietrich, you raised your hand.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so I did a lot of mindfulness exercises, you know, practice, and then there was always the compassionist compassion exercise. So you're actually saying when you're in your lotus and you're practicing compassion, you're actually practicing a concept?

**Speaker A:** Yes, you're just practicing a concept.

**Speaker B:** So it's no use.

**Speaker A:** Let us say that you could spend your time more wisely. Making the one person that you're closest to really happy, rather than wanting other people to be happy. Because anytime that you want something you don't have, that's a definition of Dukkha. You're dissatisfied. You want other people to be happy. The practice of Metta backfires. It's not actually a practice. Metta is not a practice. Metta is the result of correct practice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, also about the neighbor coming over to ask you for money and you got the money and you give it to him. That's also what I'm thinking, like, but what if the neighbor is an addict? Like a gambling addict or something. So there also has to be some wisdom in it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, right. Why are you living next to gambling addicts? Why haven't you already given him so much joy that he's happy enough to not gamble? All right. So here's a statement that I've actually seen this happen twice in my life. One was a son, and actually a stepson I guess would be, Poom. I gave him 55,000 baht, about $1,500, because he needed to pay a bribe to the army officers to keep them from drafting him. That's something that happens commonly in Thailand, that in fact it happened a lot in other wars in other places. It was happening big time in the Civil War in the United States, where the guy who had money would pay them to not draft him. So this debt of 55,000 baht He was paying a little bit of it, 500, 5,000 baht a month for a while. And then COVID came along. And then because of COVID he went back up to Nakhon Nakom, and then he came back down here, but he started to not pay. What I did was, and I recognized that he was pretty scarce, he wasn't around so much. Why was that? Because he felt guilty of not paying his debt. So I forgave him his debt. And what a relief that was to him. So I gave him two gifts. I gave him first the loan of the money, and then I forgave the debt. But this happened before when I had a— when I was a monk in the United States. Oh, let's see, he was an in-law, let's say, and he got busted for marijuana and had to put up $1,000. So I bailed him out, I gave him the $1,000, and then all of a sudden he was scarce, didn't want to come back around me. Why? Because he owed the money and he couldn't pay it. So, I forgave him that debt, and by doing so, what a relief that was for him! And what a relief it was for me! The money was not the issue; always the issue is the friendship. So, when somebody borrows money from you, make sure that when he doesn't pay you back, you're going to forgive that debt because your friendship is more important than the money. Always the friendship is the most important quality. So you gave him the money in the first place because of friendship and gratitude and generosity, and now we give it to him again by forgiving the debt. Now there's another point that I can make about this, and that is that generosity and gratitude go hand in hand. They're like two sides of the same coin. If you give something to someone and they don't appreciate it, then that means that you did not share your joy with them. That if you give someone a gift and they don't like it, then they're not getting the benefit out of it. So be careful about giving something to someone that they want or they need, because you're dealing with ordinary people, and someone in this conversation has to become noble. The choice is yours: Are you going to handle any conversation or any situation nobly, or are you going to be the ordinary person and try to get the other guy to be noble? So, this is the way of looking at it. Now, I've got an example of that. It's kind of like the example of husband and wife giving each other the gifts, and that is, that Granny comes over at Christmas time and gives Johnny his Christmas present. And so he eagerly opens it up, and it's a pair of socks. And so he mopeily walks out of the room, and on the way out, Mom says, "Aren't you going to thank Granny for the socks?" Well, actually what's going on is Granny gave socks as an obligation. It's Christmas time and she's supposed to give, so I'm going to get that obligation out of the way. But at gift-giving time, like in this situation, Granny had the opportunity to go behind Johnny's back and say, what does Johnny really want? What's something that we can give him that he'll really, really like? Maybe a bicycle, maybe a pony, maybe a BB gun, something that he's— you know, the old movies that we're talking about. But you give him something that he really, really wants. And then, his relationship with Granny is going to be very, very good. You'd be surprised at how many relationships between grandson and grandmother is lousy, because Granny does things out of obligation, rather than out of generosity. So start looking for ways that you can actually be generous. And like I'm saying, the very, very best kind of generosity that we can give is the generosity of goodwill, the generosity of a smile, the generosity of hospitality, the generosity of welcomeness. It doesn't have to be money. But what it does have to be is something that's well received. And therefore, the generosity and the gratitude work hand in hand, and both sides get immense joy out of it. So this is the way to practice generosity. It takes as much wisdom as it does to be generous with yourself when it's time to practice Anapanasati. And in fact, most people practice meditation because they have to do it. They actually give themselves sucks for meditation. And then they don't even like the present that they've given themselves. What we need to do when we're practicing is to be nurturing to ourselves, congratulate ourselves, pat ourselves on the back: "Wow, I feel good! Isn't that marvelous?" We don't feel good because we're supposed to feel good; we feel good because we like it. And so, always, charity begins at home, right on the inside. You start to nurture yourself, you start to forgive yourself of your wrongdoing, you start being able to see the things that you do wrong happily, so that you can in fact see it clearly enough that you can do something about it, you can actually change. But if you are critical of yourself, then the wrongdoings that we do, we don't want to be critical, and so we hide from it, we deny it, we lie to ourselves about the harm that we have done. To ourselves and to others. But if you have a generous heart, then whatever you do is okay. Let's take a really close look. Maybe I can do something better than this, but this is okay. And so become generous with yourself. You'll never actually learn to be generous to other people until you learn to be generous with yourself. To be nurturing, to be kind, to accept yourself just the way you are. You're okay already. You're already enlightened. You don't have to do something to become enlightened. You're already good enough. You already are there. Start treating yourself like you're worthy of being your own best friend. We don't have to criticize. We can enjoy our own company. We can cheer ourselves up. We can be generous to ourselves. See our wrongdoing not as wrongdoing, but as an opportunity to grow. Hot dog, I'm glad I saw that! Picking my nose in public. Wow, what a booger that was! Or, and I know everybody's upset, but I'm going to hide it. Nobody's going to know. All right, so this is the kind of attitude that we have, is everything is okay, everything is tasty enough, everything is just fine, there are no problems in the world. But this takes a major attitude change, because we have been taught how crummy things are, how crummy school is, how bad everything is. And we can begin to change that attitude. Stop being critical, stop being the one who gives yourself the rules, and start being a nurturing mommy. Oh, rock-a-bye baby, oh, it's okay you poop in your diaper, no problem here, everything is hunky-dory. Start seeing you're okay, that you're just fine, not a worry in the world. Keep practicing that way and you will begin to accept yourself as the champion of your own life that you really are. You don't have to be the victim, but we always wind up being a victim when we criticize ourselves. And when we stop criticizing ourselves and start nurturing ourselves and start being generous with ourselves, then we start to show gratitude in general. Wow, how great it is! What a marvelous situation this is, because you realize that you're creating that part of your reality. David, go ahead, you got a question.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, so regarding everything being okay, what about the dissatisfaction that leads to striving? The dissatisfaction that leads somebody to running a marathon in under 3 hours?

**Speaker A:** How ordinary that is. That's very worldly.

**Speaker D:** But we can bring it also to Gautama leaving the palace and seeking realization, or you know, in any number of domains, the realization that things are not, you know, there is the suffering of the misuse of the way, seeking the Dhamma.

**Speaker A:** You know. Yes. And I invite you to change that attitude, to change that attitude that everything actually already is okay. For instance, you mentioned Muay Thai before. Don't go do Muay Thai because you need it. Go do it because you like it. You don't have to go fix the world. You can just go enjoy it.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, so I can see going into actions with a sense of love and gratitude and wholeness But at the same time, that, you know, I'm thinking for whatever reason of bucks who rut in seeking mates and of wolves who hunt, and with these kind of very big images in nature of a striving towards something. And I can understand that when you are in rut or when you are climbing the mountain or when you're Siddhartha, when you're leaving the palace to seek liberation and understanding of the way of Dhamma, to do it with a sense of wholeness, but there still is that.

**Speaker A:** Earlier seed of— Yes, I invite you to eat that seed, munch on it, swallow it, and enjoy its wholesomeness rather than have it grow into the monster that you're into now.

**Speaker D:** So we're saying eat the seed of dissatisfaction that leads to wholeness with gratitude and with love.

**Speaker A:** No, it's not dissatisfaction. Change the dissatisfaction to satisfaction. Oh yeah, here's the guy that you mentioned just a moment ago about climbing the mountain. Why? Why would you climb a mountain if you're halfway up the mountain? Turn your video off or your microphone off. You got a very bad echo. Okay, so why would you climb the mountain when you can just turn around, sit down, and enjoy the view? And if you can enjoy the view from where it is, then why do you have to get up again and climb the mountain and struggle and strive? That as soon as you start walking, and then walking more, and then you start to struggle and strive again, That's the time to turn around and sit back down and enjoy even a different view. Stop the struggle and only do the work when you can feel that it's worth doing and you like it. But our society does not teach that. It teaches you that you've got to go climb that mountain. And I'm teaching you the exact opposite of that. You don't have to climb any mountains. Stop climbing mountains and enjoy your life. Stop striving and struggling and start being nurturing to yourself. You've already got everything you need. You don't need to be climbing that mountain. Everybody who practices Tai Chi eventually quits. I could name you folks like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Well, who's the guy? Oh, let's just use him as an example. He still works out, but he's not trying to be Mr. Universe again. He just enjoys it occasionally. Any Muay Thai boxer retires by the time the age of 35. When these young girls were trained by the Chinese to do gymnastics, all of them were crippled by the time they were 25. Striving gains you nothing, except the attitude of failure and you continue to strive. When you stop having the attitude, "I've got to get something," then you can stop striving and start nurturing yourself. That doesn't mean that you quit everything; that means that what you begin to do, you begin to enjoy it. Pump only as much iron as you want to; do as much Muay Thai as you enjoy doing it, but don't do it one step more that takes you into dissatisfaction. Take a break. Take it easy. Life is easy, my friend, when you take it easy. When you stop wanting to climb that mountain, wanting to do that Muay Thai, wanting to lift those weights, you're sucking on something. You want something you don't have. This is why life sucks, is because we're sucking. We're wanting things that we don't have, and we're striving to get it. And that whole society out there is built upon that mentality. And the Dhamma is learning how to stop doing everything that you've been told and sit down and enjoy your life instead. Ivan, go ahead.

**Speaker C:** Oh, Dhammarato, I really love that this, uh, what you just said, like instead of like wanting this view from the peak of the mountain, that actually on the way there, every, every view we are looking at is a view in itself. Uh, it just reminds me how so many times when I go hiking, people just want this dramatic. I mean, it's a beautiful view on top, but I don't know, I don't know, is it just me, but every time, like, every view on the trail is actually phenomenal in itself. And I mean, I'm not sure if I sound arrogant, but it's just like, what's the fascination with the view from the top when actually, you know, every view is actually good in itself?

**Speaker A:** Anapanasati.

**Speaker C:** Uh-huh.

**Speaker A:** That's a very interesting point about climbing a mountain. I've got a story about it. Some of you know him. His name is Scott. And Scott was telling the time when he was out in the wilderness and he was actually climbing. He was actually walking down the path, down the hill, and up in front of him he sees these people who are on vacation. They're on vacation in the mountains, struggling to climb up this mountain. And so what he did was he sat down on a rock and waited for them to come, and when they got close by, he was saying, "Wow, this is so beautiful! Wow!" And those people decided to heed what he says and stop and turn around and actually enjoy the fact that they were on the side of this mountain and that it was a beautiful, gorgeous view, and they were missing it because they were too busy climbing the mountain. Mountains are enjoyable only when you stop climbing. Your life is enjoyable only when you stop climbing. You rest, and then you can continue to walk, but only walk as much as you feel good to do, and then rest again. Don't try to get it all done today. Take your time. There's no hurry, there's no rush. There is deadlines. Funny thing, that word deadline, is that we'll— if we don't cross it in time, we're dead, right? And so we have a lot of fear. Oh, there's a deadline coming. Oh, we've got to get all of this stuff done. Well, all deadlines, all of them, are artificial. Some boss sets a deadline and everybody's miserable. Why don't we enjoy our work? Our society is not designed for people to enjoy their work. It's designed for you to work as hard as you can and feel bad about it, so that someone else can exploit you and feel bad too. And everybody winds up being unhappy and miserable, and everybody's going up 2, 3, 4 Let's climb that mountain, let's tote that barge and lift that bale, otherwise we'll land in jail. This is the old song that we sing. You've heard that song before, Old Man River. Comes from a movie, Showboat, or actually was a play. All right, so the whole thing is, is that we don't have to tote that barge and lift that bale until We have fun lifting that bale. What we need to do is to spend our time getting ourselves happy and joyful enough that we can go and do the work that needs to be done happily. And when we do that, we are actually being generous to ourselves, still getting the work done, probably even getting more work done. Because we enjoy doing it. And then we can spread that joy to others, to help them direct. They too can enjoy the moment. They don't have to be miserable while they work. We can whistle while we work. We can enjoy doing what we're doing, but we have to learn to enjoy first, because we've already learned to work. Miserably. So we have to take the time away and go build the joy. And when we get our joy juice going, we can do anything we want to do, up until the point that we continue doing it and we don't want to do it anymore. And that's the time to quit. Stop. Take a rest. Enjoy your life. Stop striving. Just have fun. Have fun not doing, and then have fun doing. Piti, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so interesting. I know this state of like, just be and then see what happens, and then it's always like, then I want to do something, I want to create something, I want to write a song or whatever. And then there's always this next step of getting ambitious. Okay, now I want to release this song, and now I want to be on stage with it, and now it's—.

**Speaker A:** And all we had to do was have fun singing ourselves a happy little song. We didn't need to get up on stage. That is wanting something we don't have.

**Speaker B:** But is that indoctrinated, like from being brought up that way?

**Speaker A:** So you always have that way.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so it's not like an Anapanasati, like something— it can feel really like from coming out of me, like wanting to do that. All right, so it goes off a little bit because then it gets ambitious and then it gets really like Anagami, like I'm Anagami, I have to win.

**Speaker A:** You've heard the expression a means to an end. Right? Everybody's heard of that expression, having a means to an end, and you have to have a proper means to get to the end. Guess what? There is no such thing as an end. It's all means. So why are you being mean to yourself? Why be mean to yourself when you can just enjoy doing something, because there's no end to it, there's no deadline. Just enjoy your life. Do what you like to do and have fun doing it. And stop climbing a mountain long enough to turn around and enjoy the view. I mean, why climb a mountain? And yet everybody is up there climbing that mountain and climbing that mountain. And pretty soon you climb a mountain that's so high that when you get to the top of it, you can't see a darn thing because you're above the clouds. And not only that, but you're cold and miserable. And if you spend the night on Mount Everest, you're going to be a frozen piece of meat in the morning. You cannot spend the night on Mount Everest. You've got to get off of the thing and come back to the base camp. All right. So how high does your mountains have to be before you stop climbing high mountains and just climb the ones that are easy to climb. Have fun doing it.

**Speaker B:** And what's also very interesting now, I realize when you're saying this, when you reach the top of your mountain, your self-created mountain, then you're always busy trying to keep staying on the top. And that's also Dukkha. That's also creating dissatisfaction because now you reached it.

**Speaker A:** And now you have to— Now, yeah, right. And now you have to climb down, and I want to climb another mountain. I got to climb every mountain, ford every sea, follow every rainbow. That's another song. Guess what? Stop dreaming and enjoy the rainbow. Enjoy the mountain that you're on without having to keep striving. But our whole society is built upon striving. It's actually built upon exploitation. They want you to strive so that they can profit from your striving. Why don't you quit that and start living your life joyfully? It's crazy that people are driving, climbing the mountain, and becoming the very best at Mr. Universe and all of this kind of stuff, when most of those things are momentary. What we really need is to practice something that we can continue to practice and gained great benefit out of it over and over and over again. Weightlifting is not one of them. Eventually people quit weightlifting because they're not getting anything out of it anymore. You've heard the expression, he who lives by the sword dies by the sword, right? The young buck, this, all that training, and he's going to Shaolin and he's got that sword out and he's whacking this, that, and the other thing. He's going to get old, and by the time he's 45, somebody's going to cut him in half if he doesn't put down that sword. We have to stop striving. We can be the very, very best there is at something, but that's not going to last. Somebody else is going to be just as hard on themselves as you have been, and they're going to take your title away from you. Why hasn't Muhammad Ali won the title one time and then quit? Why did he have to do it 3 times until he gave himself Parkinson's disease? They beat the crap out of him because he wanted that championship so bad that he crippled himself getting it. That happens big time with Muay Thai boxers here in Thailand. And in fact, very few of them can last until 35, but you know what happens to them in Thailand? Many of the Muay Thai fighters, when they retire, they become a monk. That's why you find old monks with tattoos. They didn't get them when they were a monk, they got them when they were in Muay Thai. And then they quit the Muay Thai and they sit down and enjoy their life instead. So this is what I would offer you. Is to stop striving, because even if you win, it's temporary. Why not just enjoy the path, enjoy what you're doing, learn to enjoy your life? And when you can be generous to yourself, you can be generous to everybody that you meet. Ivan, do you have anything to say? How about you, Amrit?

**Speaker E:** No, thanks a lot. I'm satisfied. I will enjoy the rest of the Sunday now.

**Speaker A:** Even though it's raining. Go ahead, I'm listening.

**Speaker E:** Even though it was, uh, when the call started, it was sunny and I was expecting to go out for a nice walk. Now it's raining, so I will just sit, sit in my room and enjoy it here.

**Speaker A:** Just enjoy. Exactly, enjoy the rain, whether you're out in it or sitting inside. How about you, Carl? You have any remarks to make?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I thought it was a very good—.

**Speaker A:** You turn your mic back off. You're muted. There you go.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, no, I said I really enjoyed it, and also regarding striving and ambition. How it kills spontaneity, you know, and that actually takes the joy out of it, you know. So I thought it was a very good comment.

**Speaker A:** Oh, I'm a big fan of lazy. I'm a big fan of lazy. My dad called me lazy when I was in high school because I wouldn't cut the grass like he wanted me to. He even found neighbors on the other side of town for me to go cut their grass. And it eventually dawned on me that it was my dad who was being lazy because he wanted me to cut the grass. He wanted the grass cut, but he was too lazy to cut it himself, and so he called me lazy to get me to cut the grass. I don't want the grass cut, I like grass. There's a double entendre there someplace. So, Deidre, do you have any final comments?

**Speaker B:** No, I had a ball. Thank you so very much. Generosity and really an ambition.

**Speaker A:** How about you, Andre? I mean, Alexandra? Well, not really.

**Speaker E:** It just reminds me of The idea that the goal is not really important, but follow the destination, like the path. Based on what you just said, I really want to, because it actually reminds me my own experience. I cycling from France to Nepal, and I experienced that once I get to Nepal, at the border, I didn't feel anything. And it actually was much more enjoying before, like every time I would cross a country, it was really amazing. But once I got to my goal, I was like, "Okay, whatever, never mind.".

**Speaker A:** Okay. Well, maybe you're okay in Mumbai, you don't have to go to Nepal. That's just a thought, just a concept. Okay. Well, mute your mic. Michael, do you have anything to say? You've been grinning the whole time. I really love your grin.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, it's been a really excellent conversation. I'm so happy to see so many people here today. I did want to shout out, we've had a couple of volunteers that have joined us and have been helping us lately. So thank you so much for that. You know who you are. And Yeah, it's just— and it's nice to see the generosity really in motion here in this Sangha, just by showing up, even if you don't have much to say. It's nice to see your face smiling and for you to be a part of these talks. So I appreciate it.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so I really am so happy that you're all here. And I've really enjoyed this talk. I really get a big kick out of the Dhamma. I'm delighted with the Dharma. I'm happy that I can share that delight with you. May you all be delighted. May all of you be enthusiastic with your life. Enjoy your life. Have fun with it. And so I wish you all well, and we'll see you soon. Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points discussed by Dhammarato and the Sangha:

### **Core Theme: Generosity as an Outcome of Correct Practice**
The talk began with a request to discuss **generosity (dāna)**, but Dhammarato immediately framed it not as a standalone practice, but as a **natural outcome of correct meditation and mindset**. Just like metta (loving-kindness), joy, and gratitude, generosity flows from correctly following the Noble Eightfold Path.

### **The Foundation: Correct Practice & The Four Noble Truths**
*   **Dukkha as Dissatisfaction:** The primary teaching is reframed from "suffering" to **"dissatisfaction"**—the little, present-moment annoyances and discomforts we can actually address.
*   **The Goal of Practice:** Not to dig up deep, buried trauma, but to deal with the dissatisfactions **visible right now**. If a problem is active, it's at the surface.
*   **The Method:** Using **Right View** to see our dissatisfaction clearly. Once seen, it can be adjusted—like setting a toy horse upright. This applies to four areas: body, feelings, mental states, and thoughts.

### **Shifting from Victim to "King of Your World"**
A major focus was on transforming our default **"victim mentality"**—feeling forced to do things we dislike (e.g., hating school, work, or even meditation).
*   **The Key Insight:** We often can't change what we have to do, but **we can change how we feel about it**. The practice is to start **liking what we are doing**.
*   **The Root of Negativity:** All negative emotions (anger, frustration, guilt, worry) are traced back to **fear**, which stems from the victim mindset ("I'm not up to the task," "things are dangerous").
*   **The Practice:** Create **safety and seclusion**—first physically, then mentally. Use **wholesome, gladdening thoughts** to shift attitude: *"I feel safe, secure, comfortable. Everything is okay. I can handle anything."*
*   **The Result:** This cultivates a **sense of well-being, wealth (having enough), and becoming the "emperor" or "king" of your own life**—sitting on top of your "pile of dirt" happily, rather than struggling under it.

### **Generosity, Metta, and Wisdom**
*   **Generosity:** True generosity arises from a **sense of inner wealth and abundance** ("I have more than enough"). It's a joy to give, and the **giver receives the greater benefit**—the happiness of giving. It applies not just to money, but to joy, smiles, and hospitality.
    *   **Wisdom in Giving:** Give what the other person **actually needs and will appreciate** (like giving a child a desired gift, not socks out of obligation). This strengthens connection.
    *   **Example with Loans:** If you lend money, be prepared to **forgive the debt** to preserve friendship, which is more valuable than money.
*   **Metta (Loving-Kindness):** Dhammarato made a provocative point: **Metta is a result, not a practice**. Chanting "may all beings be happy" is a future-oriented concept that can reinforce a victim mindset ("I'll be happy when they are"). Real metta is the **natural radiance of joy** from someone who has found their own well-being. Spread joy to the people actually in front of you.
*   **Charity Begins at Home:** You must first learn to be **generous, nurturing, and forgiving to yourself**. Stop self-criticism. See mistakes as opportunities. **Accept yourself as "already okay"** and as your own best friend. This inner generosity then overflows to others.

### **Letting Go of Striving and Ambition**
A significant thread addressed **ambition and striving** as major sources of dukkha.
*   **The Mountain-Climbing Metaphor:** Society teaches us to strive for peaks (goals, achievements, titles). But this creates dissatisfaction with the present. The Dhamma alternative is to **stop climbing, turn around, and enjoy the view where you are right now**.
*   **The Problem with Goals:** Striving is based on **wanting something you don't have**. Even if you achieve a goal (win a title, release a song), you then struggle to maintain it or seek the next one, creating more dissatisfaction.
*   **The Alternative:** **Do things because you enjoy the activity itself**, not for a future result. "Pump only as much iron as you want to." Life becomes easy when you **stop sucking (wanting)** and start **nurturing and enjoying**. This doesn't mean inaction, but action infused with present-moment joy.

### **Community Dialogue Highlights**
*   **Alexander** shared an experience of feeling sadness after an act of generosity (buying food for a beggar), getting stuck in thoughts about her suffering future. Dhammarato and **Deidre** pointed out this was taking on a "rescuer" burden. The liberating insight is **you can only fix yourself**; in the moment, you gave joy, which was enough.
*   **David** questioned if the "everything is okay" attitude negates the "divine dissatisfaction" that drives seeking (e.g., Siddhartha leaving the palace). Dhammarato clarified: **you can seek, but do it with joy and satisfaction in the process itself, not with a mindset of lack**.
*   **Ivan** and others resonated with the idea of **finding every step of the path beautiful**, not just the peak.

### **Conclusion**
The talk wove together **generosity, correct practice, and the abandonment of the victim/striver mentality**. The path is to:
1.  **Practice correctly** by addressing present-moment dissatisfaction with gladdening thoughts.
2.  **Cultivate an inner sense of safety, wealth, and kingship** over your own life.
3.  **Let generosity and metta flow naturally** from that inner abundance.
4.  **Replace striving with enjoying**, doing things for the love of the action, not for a future goal.

The ultimate generosity is giving yourself and others the gift of **joy in the present moment**.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on your transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses a rich tapestry of metaphors and stories to illustrate Buddhist principles, particularly around correct practice, dissatisfaction (Dukkha), and generosity. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **The Classroom & Spitballs:** The Sangha call is compared to a classroom where "all the kids are throwing spitballs at the teacher." This sets the tone for an interactive, non-hierarchical, and slightly chaotic community discussion, not a formal lecture.

2.  **The Briar Patch:** Life without practice (driven by dissatisfaction) is like blindly wandering into a "thicket, brambles, briars." It's a painful, tangled situation we get ourselves into by not paying attention.

3.  **The Buried Corpse:** A metaphor for "deep" psychological problems. The speaker argues that if problems were truly buried like a deep corpse, they wouldn't haunt us. The fact that they surface means they are present and accessible *now*, not hidden in the distant past. We should deal with what's in front of us.

4.  **The Toy Horse on Its Side:** Correcting our situation is often simple once we see it clearly. It's like seeing a toy horse knocked over; the solution isn't complex, you just "set it upright." The Buddha's teachings are presented as "setting things right" that are "wonky-jawed" or "on their side."

5.  **The Victim:** A central, recurring story. The speaker claims we are born, raised, and taught to be "victims"—doing things we don't like because we think we have to (e.g., Ross teaching his kids to hate school because he did). The path out is to stop being a victim to our circumstances, duties, and even to our meditation practice ("victim to meditation").

6.  **The Emperor & The Pile of Dirt:** Each person is the "emperor of their own pile of dirt." The key question is: Are you drowning under it, struggling to climb out, or happily "sitting on top of the world"? The goal is to feel like the successful ruler of your own life.

7.  **The Safe Porch / Paradise vs. Hellhole:** Safety and paradise are states of mind. The island (Koh Phangan) is a paradise to some and a hellhole to others. The metaphor extends to anywhere: you can choose to see your immediate environment (your "porch") as a safe paradise, regardless of external conditions. "Paving this paradise and putting up another bungalow" represents the striving that ruins the present enjoyment.

8.  **The Bodhisattva Gate:** A satirical story about the Bodhisattva vow (to enlighten all beings before oneself). The speaker depicts it as a "swinging door" where people are outside fighting to throw others in first, not realizing they can go in and out freely. The point is that you don't need to be a martyr or victim to the gate; you can attain peace and then help others from a position of abundance.

9.  **The Wrong Gift (Christian Golden Rule Example):** A story of a husband and wife exchanging terrible Christmas gifts (C-SPAN/panties for a dishwasher) illustrates misguided generosity—giving what *you* think is good, not what the other person needs. This contrasts with the Buddhist approach of giving what is truly needed (a smile, joy, specific help).

10. **Climbing the Mountain:** This is the **primary extended metaphor** for striving, ambition, and dissatisfaction.
    *   **The Striver:** The person struggling to reach the peak represents worldly ambition, goal-orientation, and the belief that happiness is "over there."
    *   **The One Who Enjoys the View:** The wise person (like Scott in the story) stops on the trail, turns around, and enjoys the beautiful view *right where they are*. The lesson is that every step of the path offers its own beauty if you stop striving for the summit.
    *   **Mount Everest:** Taking the metaphor to its extreme: reaching the highest peak (ultimate worldly success) is cold, miserable, dangerous, and unsustainable. You can't stay there; you must come down.

### **Smaller Analogies & Phrases**

*   **"Monkey mind"**: A common metaphor for restless, uncontrolled thought.
*   **"Eat the seed"**: When discussing the "seed of dissatisfaction," the speaker advises to "eat" it—consume and dissolve it with awareness and satisfaction before it grows into a monster of striving.
*   **"Joy juice"**: The internal wellspring of happiness that fuels enjoyable action.
*   **"Means to an end"**: The speaker subverts this, saying life is **all means** and there is no final "end." Therefore, don't be "mean" to yourself in the process.
*   **Muhammad Ali / Muay Thai Boxers / Weightlifters:** Used as stories to show how striving for titles and peak performance leads to physical and mental damage, and is ultimately temporary. The Muay Thai boxer who becomes a monk symbolizes the transition from striving to peaceful enjoyment.
*   **The Lazy Father:** A personal story where the speaker's father called him lazy for not cutting the grass. The speaker reframes it: the father was "lazy" because he wanted the grass cut but didn't want to do it himself. This challenges our assumptions about productivity and desire.

### **Overall Narrative Purpose**
The metaphors and stories consistently build a central argument: **Stop being a victim to external and internal demands, stop striving for future goals, and instead learn to find safety, paradise, and joy in your present-moment experience.** From this place of abundant well-being, qualities like true generosity and *metta* naturally flow as outcomes, not as forced practices. The imagery is designed to be earthy, relatable, and often humorous to undermine the listener's habitual patterns of struggle and dissatisfaction.
