### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So anyway, Pedro, we started with you giving a kind of a review of the fact that you're beginning to get it, and I'd like for you to go over that with us a little bit again.

**Speaker B:** Yes, so, well, I start really to.

**Speaker A:** Remember.

**Speaker B:** Each time, and each time before, like your pointings, like also in meditation and breathing, but also through the day, also as I wake up, or also doing the activities of the days, I really see that, yeah, I'm starting to recognize that I can be satisfied here and now. Yes.

**Speaker A:** We started also to talk about experiences.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** That most people, that in fact you could say that an experience, kind of like you could even say a religious experience, that this is what often is done, that people for many, many centuries and in many different ways have been looking for an experience, an experience, for instance, of the magician pulling a rabbit out of the hat. And everybody says, "I wonder how that happened," and all of this kind of stuff. We also have religious experiences. And that in fact, certain kinds of services are designed to get people into having those kinds of religious experiences. Sometimes they call them holy rollers, when they're rolling on the floor or speaking in tongues or all of that, is to create a new experience for people, something that's never happened before. And that those experiences also are supposed to mean something. It's like the gateway or the doorway into something really profound, really important.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I remember also at first I was following like Hinduism or Christianity, Christianism, and I was like really event-oriented. In fact, when I like got something out of it, like a big event, big transformation and so on, that okay, in some ways changed my life. But also it was like a not really good thing that happened because I spent like 2 years attached to that thing. Not knowing that I could, I should have gone on immediately, like, okay, just an experience, and try to build in the present my confidence, not event related. In fact, the first call that I made with you was a few years.

**Speaker A:** Ago.

**Speaker B:** Because I wanted wanted to know you, and you told me this thing that in the West we are event-oriented, like the wedding or the first son or the first house, while we have to learn to be present-oriented, process-oriented better. So this is a good aspect I'm learning, yes.

**Speaker A:** Yes, so this is back to that, and in the Western mind We're taught through our society to be event-oriented. And look how many different event kind of things there are. How about going to work and punching in on the clock? That's an event, it marks the day. They do their math and calculations from that, and all kinds of ideas that get really deeply into our experience. Of meditation because we're looking for experience. And some experiences will happen, they happen naturally. But getting attached to those experiences will then cause us dangers later. Like you did something and then you feel really good and had the experience of feeling really good. So now you want to feel really good again because you know what it feels like. Now, the first time you didn't know what it felt like to feel really good in this way. So now that you do know how it feels because you've been there, done that, you want to do it again. And so now, instead of doing what you did before to get there, now whatever it is, we've added the ingredients of knowing where we're going, knowing the destination. And wanting it. And the very wanting it prevents us from being satisfied, because we're not satisfied without it. We still want it. We want these experiences. And further, in our society, we use these experiences as a marker for attainments, and often even bragging rights. Oh, I had this and that experience, okay? And that we then often, because of the attainment quality of it, think that Buddhism then is just one special insight after another special event after another special experience, etc., like that. And so they're sort of like stones across the river, across the brook, and you got to find what's the next stone to step on. To where the real teaching of the Buddha is just watch where you're going and just walk right across. You don't have to find some particular stone to step on, but any footing will do. And so that gets us out of this desire and want for special experiences, especially the kind of experiences that then we use to, let us say, prove an attainment, or like I said, bragging rights, because we're often looking for that. We're looking for let us say, a confirmation. But we want really big ones, and the ones that really pile up and become important are the little confirmations, in the sense of, "Yes, I can come out of whatever experience I was in and come back to the present moment." That in fact it's better to not think about having experiences, or that the experiences are often manufactured anyway, based upon feelings and whatnot, based upon judgments that we're making. And so instead, we could just start paying attention to what's happening right now. We make that major change, and to recognize that right now is good enough. Yeah, now there is a kind of time or a kind of thing that, uh, where an event happens that it becomes kind of an important point. Here's an example of that, that you walk into the kitchen and you start, uh, talking to somebody and, uh, you see the counter there and so you lean against the counter only to realize way too late that it was one of those newfangled cooking stoves, and you've just put your hand on a very, very hot burner, and ouch, it hurts, it's painful, it stays that way for a while. Okay, so we'll remember that so that the next time we go into that kitchen, we're going to be very mindful of that stove, right? It kind of works in that direction. Of avoidance of pain. But if we have a really good experience, there is not going to be that insight into it that's going to keep bringing it back over and over again, that that needs to be done with practice. Yeah, to keep talking yourself into feeling good and then allowing yourself to feel good. We can have those wholesome thoughts like everything right now is okay. This is good enough. This is good enough. This is good enough. I say it like that, it reminds me of the commercial years ago when cell phones were first being sold. And this guy was walking around, "Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now?" And they had these places, he'd be all over the world, he'd be in Rome, he'd be in London, he'd be in New York, he'd be all over the place, you know, and always walking around, "Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now?" So we can see that as the Dharma in the sense of, are we looking now? This is what's happening now. We can be here now, checking it out, because that's all there is to it. Not expensive experiments or experiences and things. That a lot of students, even when they can get to this state, then they'll ask the question, well, what next? And when we ask that question, that means that we just fell out of it, that yeah, this is good enough, but then the Dukkha comes in, into the point of, well, wait a minute, maybe it's not good enough, maybe something next is happening. And so we come out of that satisfaction to ask What's next?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like I realize sometimes that I go into the state, if like I start to feel the urge to ask for help, other people for attending, for getting something. Because actually I realize that when I feel good, I don't ask anything to anybody. And when I see, okay, maybe I will go him and ask him for I realize that I'm in a state of neediness. So like, I understand and say, okay, no, no, no, I catch it. Because, you know, when I realize that everything is okay, I just do out of passion and not out of neediness, you know. So, and, and, uh, yeah, I lean on, on the capabilities on the Dharma. And so when I see, like, starting to see, like, oh, maybe I call my brother and complain about my life, I notice.

**Speaker A:** But he doesn't want to hear you complain about your life. He wants you to listen while he complains about his.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** And so the question then will come is, is that, can you actually listen to him complain about his life and still not have anything to complain about in your own. No complaints, no worries. Yeah, but for sure, the place to start is by not going to your brother to complain, because if you do, you owe him. That's an important word, in fact. I'm glad that you brought it up. I forget to mention it often, that this is something that we can actually pay attention to when we're dealing with others, and then we can also pay attention to it when we do it within our own mind. And that is any kind of thought that can be considered complaining. Okay, that in fact you can't complain to your brother unless you're already complaining within your own mind anyway. The thought precedes speech, but in fact, that we almost can say that we rehearse it first. We figure out what we're going to say, we think it through, then we say it.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** Not everybody does that.

**Speaker B:** But there is like the still point in relationship where you like in the eye, how to say, the eye of the tornado, where like, okay, I will not get into it, otherwise I'll end up fighting, otherwise I will end up complaining, because I see it earlier. And so there's like this still point in relationship.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's a good analogy. This, the center of the hurricane is peaceful. There is another analogy that I've seen in art in Asia, and that is the monk is sitting peacefully as the tongue of a big snake with big fangs. Okay, the caption of that would be Be like the tongue of the snake. Why? Because the snake doesn't bite his own tongue.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so you could be surrounded by danger, but you're still safe, which is exactly the same thing as in that hurricane or in that tornado. You're in the center of it where it's peaceful. It's not anywhere else is dangerous.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** So going back to that point about complaining is that if we can catch ourselves complaining, then we can do something about it. And a lot of the kinds of thoughts we have are actually thoughts of complaining about something that happened that we don't like, and we want to try to fix it or something. And then the other one would be thinking about what to do about it, trying to fix something. So, we're either complaining, because we don't like that it's broken, or we're busy trying to fix it. When in fact, everything is already okay. Yeah, relationship got broken in the past, but that's in the past. Leave it in the past, don't worry about it. Be here in the present moment, instead of worrying about an old broken relationship. So not complaining anymore is part of the path that you could— in fact, you could begin to see that's part of right noble speech, is that we don't complain. And I'm really glad that you brought that up because you were mentioning that you go to complain to or about your brother. So you can recognize that now. You can stop that complaining. And I'm really glad you told me. I said that before. I'm glad you told me because I wouldn't to talk to you until you told me about complaining to your brother. But that's a major, major step on the path, is to recognize that we've got no complaints. Everything is already okay. No worries, no complaints. And so when the mind gets into a complaining mentality, a complaining mode, say, 'I see you, Mr. Complainer.' I can treat my brother better than that. Okay. Must have said something that touched you. You've gone right quiet. So anyway, back to the beginning, Pedro. I'm really pleased that you're making progress, that you're actually getting it, that you can come out of— in fact, you can begin to see that you can come out of your complaining. Yes, you can just let things be okay the way that they are. They don't have to be special, they don't have to be superlative. But when everything gets really, really okay, that is superlative. I mean, think about it, if things were just absolutely nothing better or more than just okay, that is marvelous. Because almost always we could find something that's not up to scratch, not up to okay, not ordinary, not good enough. And here we have come to the point that everything is okay. Now that is an amazing accomplishment. That everything's just okay, everything's fine.

**Speaker B:** It starts from there, to go around, like we start from this point, that everything is okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Rather than starting from complaining to go after the point that everything is okay. Now I can start from everything is okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. No complaining, no worry, everything's okay. And that is a marvelous state to be in, just being in the senses, being in the present moment, and everything's just fine.

**Speaker B:** Good point, Dhammarato. Wow, beautiful.

**Speaker A:** Great. Well, you go play with that. Make this a new toy to play with. And we'll talk to you in a couple of days then. This has been a good talk. It's been short, but I think it's gotten something useful for you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Definitely. Well, all right, we'll see you. All right, see you.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, the core teaching revolves around shifting from an **event-oriented** mindset to a **present-moment, process-oriented** approach to practice and life. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Main Theme: From Event-Oriented to Present-Oriented**
The discussion critiques the common tendency, especially in Western culture, to seek special, transformative **experiences** (religious, meditative, or life events) as markers of progress or attainment. This creates attachment and dissatisfaction, because once you have a "good" experience, you crave it again, and your practice becomes about chasing that feeling instead of being present.

### **Key Insights**
1.  **The Trap of Special Experiences:** Seeking dramatic "insights" or states can be like looking for specific stones to cross a river. The real teaching is simpler: any footing in the present moment will do. Satisfaction comes from seeing that **"here and now is good enough."**
2.  **Cultivating Continuous Satisfaction:** The practice is to repeatedly talk yourself into feeling okay *now*, using thoughts like "This is good enough." It’s compared to the old "Can you hear me now?" cell phone ads—a constant, gentle check-in with the present.
3.  **The "What's Next?" Question:** Asking "what's next?" is a sign you've just fallen out of contentment. It signals the arrival of *dukkha* (suffering/stress) in the form of doubt that the present isn't sufficient.
4.  **The Role of Complaining:** A major practical indicator of moving out of the present is **complaining**—either internally or to others (like complaining to a brother). Complaining reveals a state of neediness and dissatisfaction.
    *   **The Practice:** Catch the complaining mind. The moment you see it, you can stop. This is a direct application of **Right Speech**. The goal is to reach a point where you start from "everything is okay," rather than starting from complaint to try to *get to* okay.
5.  **Metaphors for Stability in Turmoil:**
    *   **The Eye of the Tornado:** Finding a still, peaceful point within chaotic relationships or circumstances.
    *   **The Tongue of the Snake:** Like a snake that never bites its own tongue, you can remain safe and non-harming even when surrounded by "danger" or difficulty.

### **Conclusion & Encouragement**
The talk concludes by celebrating the simple but profound accomplishment of realizing **"everything is okay right now."** This is not a mediocre state, but a "marvelous" and "superlative" one because it is free from the constant picking and choosing that finds fault with the ordinary. The instruction is to "play with this" as a new way of being.

**In essence:** Stop chasing experiences and stop complaining. Instead, continually return to and cultivate the direct understanding that the present moment, as it is, is already satisfactory and good enough. This is the foundation for genuine peace and the heart of the practice.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the talk uses several metaphors and stories to illustrate its points about spiritual practice, attachment to experiences, and finding satisfaction in the present. Here is a breakdown:

### **Metaphors and Analogies:**

1.  **Stones Across a River/Brook:** This is used to critique the common spiritual misconception of seeking a series of special insights or experiences as milestones.
    *   **Metaphor:** The seeker sees enlightenment as a series of special stones (events/insights) they must find and step on to cross the river.
    *   **Contrasting Teaching:** The true teaching is to "just watch where you're going and just walk right across." Any footing (any present moment) will do. The goal is to stop searching for special "stepping stones" and be present.

2.  **The Center of the Hurricane/Tornado:** Used by both speakers to describe a point of peace and non-reactivity amidst chaos.
    *   **Metaphor:** In the turbulent "eye of the tornado" or the calm "center of the hurricane," one can find a "still point" in relationships and life. It's peaceful at the center while everything around is chaotic. This illustrates maintaining inner peace regardless of external drama.

3.  **The Tongue of the Snake:** Presented by Speaker A (Dhammarato) as an Asian art analogy for the same principle as the hurricane's eye.
    *   **Metaphor:** A monk sits peacefully as the tongue of a snake with big fangs. "The snake doesn't bite his own tongue." You can be surrounded by danger (the snake's fangs, life's problems) but remain safe and at peace within yourself.

4.  **The Hot Stove:** A story to illustrate how painful experiences create immediate, lasting mindfulness for avoidance, contrasting with how we treat pleasant experiences.
    *   **Story:** You lean on a kitchen counter, not realizing it's a hot stove burner, and burn your hand. The pain creates a strong memory, making you "very mindful of that stove" in the future. The point is that we naturally learn from pain to avoid harm, but we don't have the same automatic insight from good experiences—those require conscious practice to integrate.

5.  **"Can you hear me now?" (Cell Phone Commercial):** Used as a modern, relatable metaphor for continuous mindfulness.
    *   **Metaphor:** The man constantly testing his phone connection ("Can you hear me now?") in various locations represents the Dharma practice of continually checking in with the present moment. It's about constantly asking, "Am I present *now*? What's happening *now*?" It frames mindfulness as simple, immediate, and always available, not an "expensive experiment."

### **Conceptual Frameworks (which function as metaphorical contrasts):**

*   **Event-Oriented vs. Process/Present-Oriented:** This is a central conceptual metaphor for two ways of living.
    *   **Event-Oriented:** Life is a series of milestones (wedding, first house, spiritual experiences, punching a clock). We live for and get attached to these peaks.
    *   **Process/Present-Oriented:** Life is found in the ongoing "here and now." Satisfaction is built in the present, not from events. Speaker B shares how he was previously "event-oriented" in his spiritual search, attached to big transformation events, and is now learning to be "present-oriented."

*   **Complaining as a Debt ("you owe him"):** Speaker A introduces the idea that complaining to someone creates a kind of social or karmic debt.
    *   **Metaphorical Concept:** When you go to someone to complain, you "owe him." This frames complaining not just as negative speech but as a transactional burden that binds you and the listener in a cycle of dissatisfaction.

**In summary,** the talk uses metaphors of **journeying** (stones across the river), **finding peace in chaos** (eye of the storm, tongue of the snake), and **learning from experience** (the hot stove) to dismantle the seeker's attachment to special events. It contrasts the **event-oriented** mindset with the **process-oriented** path, using the modern metaphor of the cell phone test ("Can you hear me now?") to point toward the simple, continual practice of present-moment awareness, free from complaint.
