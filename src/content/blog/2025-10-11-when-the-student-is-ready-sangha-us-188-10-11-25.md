### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So welcome, friends. Today is Saturday, October 11th. It's a little after 9 AM, and that's the same as Friday evening in the US. And so welcome. Today we're going to be talking about the Triratna, which translates to the Three Gems, or the Triple Gem, and we're going to take a look at it in a slightly different way than it normally is. In fact, normally what the Triple Gem is is nothing more than a ritual, is part of a ritual. And so the ritual way of talking about it is taking refuge in the Buddha, taking refuge in the Dhamma, and taking refuge in the Sangha. And it's generally, or almost always, in that order. Now, in some of the suttas, it goes into a whole lot more detail than that. And that the same thing is true about the ceremonies. If you go to a wat or a temple on every Buddha Day, they will do two pieces of ceremonies together, as well as other ceremonial things. And that is taking the Triple Gem and also taking the precepts. Now these two things go kind of hand in hand together. The Pali is: Buddham saranam gacchami, Dhammam saranam gacchami. And when the monk does those three or four words, then The people in the audience will repeat it. Samma Sangha, Sankhara, and then the people repeat it. Then he'll say it a second time. Dukkha, Buddha, Sankhara, Dharma, Sangha, Sankhara, and then Trityampi. So he said three things. and then they give the precepts. Now, I'm not going to go through all the five precepts in Pali, but it starts with Panatipata V Ramani Sukhabadam Samati Amin, which means to not kill. Now, this ceremony has two levels. One is the level of the people who were being introduced to this. And many people will spend much of their lives in that introduction. And then the other level are those who have actually done it. Now, in the Samyutta Nikaya and the 55s, the 55 group is actually about Srotapanna. Now, the definition of the word Srotapanna or stream entry is one who is in the flow or in the Dharma. And that there are several different ways of understanding this, but today we're going to be looking at it from the sense that when someone takes refuge in the Buddha, takes refuge in the Sangha, and in the Dharma, the word refuge here means that it's a safe harbor. Not dangerous. People have to deal with dangers during their whole lives, but if they are practicing and actually taking refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha, that means that they are not likely to wind up in some hell state. In fact, they're not going to wind up in some hell state. We've got better things to do than to muck around with a bunch of crap. And so we can say then that we relate the Sangha, are taking refuge in the Sangha, are taking refuge in the friendship of the monks. That's what the word Sangha means. It means a community of friends. And when we are in a community of friends, We wouldn't kill someone because they don't like it. It's an unfriendly thing to do to kill someone, and you don't want them to kill you back. You would see that as an unfriendly thing to do, or harm you in any way. The same thing is true about taking things that are not given. That's an unfriendly thing to do. Messing around with someone's partner, that's an unfriendly thing to do. And also getting our friends into trouble by lying to them, and also calling them names and being harsh and gossiping about them, telling lies about them. And then there's another one that's very interesting in the sutra where it talks about frivolous speech. And that one has always been a difficulty for me in the sense of, well, what is frivolous speech? And the answer to that is that it's frivolous when it annoys someone. When it becomes annoying, then it's not friendly. And a lot of speech is just friendly chatter, and it is friendly. But when our friendly chatter annoys someone, then it's not friendly. So we can say then that the precepts are actually not laws or rules that are not to be broken, but rather that it's just unfriendly behavior, and that the entire Buddhist teaching is based upon friendship. In fact, there is a sutta called the Hap Sutta where Ananda asked the Buddha, he says, is that friendship seems to be half the practice? And the Buddha says, no, friendship is all there is, it's the entire practice. And so this is why the Triple Gem, including taking refuge in the noble Sangha, is also related to the precepts. Is because the precepts are designed to allow someone to easily understand even without wisdom. One can see and understand the precepts are basically there to help one just stay on a friendly basis. And yet in our society, friendship seems to be hard to do. In fact, breaking up, you've heard, is hard to do. Well, breaking up is hard to do because friendship was hard to do. If there was friendship in the first place, then there wouldn't be any breaking up. But political groups break up, and political parties fight with each other, and religions fight with each other as groups. Countries fight with each other. All kinds of discord happens because of this lack of friendliness. So if we can actually see then that the Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha are actually work together. Now, one of the ways of thinking about it is, and this is the way that I have been thinking about it all along, is Buddha, Dharma, Sangha comes in that order as if it's either the order of occurrence or the order of importance. And so my time when I spend with other people is always associated with Buddhist teaching the Dharma and presenting the Dharma in a noble fashion so that people then can learn about the Dharma, practice it well, so that then they can become more friendly. So today I want to point out that that may not be the best way of looking at it, that in fact most of the people that each one of you deal with are ordinary people who are not in the Dharma. Now we can see ordinary people as they don't know the Dharma, they are not interested in the Dharma, they don't believe in the Buddha, etc., like that. And when I say don't believe in the Buddha, that means that The people that they see, they don't recognize. And most of the time, the people that they're around are not noble. Now, when someone does find it, we can say then that being around the noble people and associated with noble people, that's that fulfillment of the Buddha, to take refuge in the fact that there are people who really do know how to find freedom and can help you to understand how to do it. Now, there's more than just associating with noble people and hearing the Dhamma from them. One must also do two other things, and that is to practice the teaching, to practice the Dhamma, And then the fourth one is to become familiar with the Dhamma, understand it, spend our time on it, and fully incorporate the Dharma. So first we associate with nobles, that's the Buddha, and then we hear the Dhamma, and then we practice the Dhamma, and then we understand the Dhamma on a deep level. These are then the Dhamma aspect of it, and that these four things along with the Triple Gem and the precepts then has that quality of the Srotapanna. Now there's other ways of looking at what is or who is a Srotapanna based upon the fact that they understand that they're not a soul. Or a fixed entity, that everyone is a moving target. Everyone can change. That, in fact, the teaching of the Buddha is a change model. And once we understand that we can change, that changes our understanding of who we are. In fact, it helps us to not try to understand who we are, because understanding who we are is almost like a fixed entity, and we keep changing. And so it's better not. And we've seen a lot of practices, especially out of India, where they ask the question, who am I, or what am I? And the answer to that is you're not what you think you are, because by the time you think it and get an idea of who you are or a concept, you've changed and you're not that anymore. But when you can understand that you're actually a moving target, then you begin to see the movements. You can see the changes. You can see that you're not a fixed entity. Now, one of the things that actually predefines who we are or sets us up to thinking that we're a certain thing is because throughout our whole lives we've gathered up a bunch of shoulds, woulds, coulds, oughtas, rules, rituals, standards, and those kinds of things, which we can then package up into a state called morality. And that we then go around applying these rules, generally to ourselves, not in a friendly way at all, but in a critical way. And then we go around applying these rules to other people, not in a friendly way, but in a critical way. An example of that is the Christians are trying to pass laws about abortion. That's not a friendly thing to do at all. So If in fact we could work with this friendliness concept, we would be a whole lot better off. In fact, if the friendliness is the Dharma, if you can be friendly moment by moment to yourself and be friendly moment by moment to each and every person that you deal with, then that fulfills the Dhamma. Because if you're friendly and happy in this moment, Where's the Dukkha? Isn't that interesting that in fact the Buddha was quite correct that all there is is friendliness? That's all there is to the Dharma. But we are often critical of ourselves because we've got these standards, these rules, and many of them are so high that we couldn't possibly stand them. But in fact, that's kind of funny, is that like in sports— and I'll use the example of the pole vaulting— because there are world records and occasionally that world record is beaten, we set our bar way high, even though we don't take a run and we don't even have a pole vault. All we do is land flat on our face in failure because we've set that bar way too high for ourselves. Okay, the nurturing thing to do is if you're going to jump, land safely, land happily. Or even better than that, why go jumping around? Can't we be satisfied with just being where we are? Why do we have to have all of these goals and missions and all of these kind of things that we always fail at? When in fact the only real thing that we need to do is to be friendly to ourselves. And this is where the practice comes in, is that if the mind has an unwholesome thought, more than likely the unwholesome thought is going to be a critical thought, a thought of standards of how things should be, as opposed to having nurturing thoughts which don't have standards. And so if we are nurturing ourselves while we are practicing, calling that practice, because in fact we're practicing being friendly with ourselves, then we can then take that out into the world and practice being friendly with other people. And when we get very good at that, then that's all there is, is just playing around with people, just being happy. That's basically the entire teachings of the Buddha right there. All of this stuff about the Pali and all of these suttas and all of these precepts and all of this Triple Gem stuff is actually not nearly as valuable a teaching as the teaching of friendliness, that this is the major teaching. Now, what you can say then is that this friendliness also has the quality of building rapport with people. Now, we can see it in two ways. One is we can see it in the community of friends when we see it in the Sangha, either the online Sangha or around the Watts or other places like that. And then we can think of it as building rapport with those who are not interested in the Dharma. At all. And this is a very, very interesting point, is that if you try to teach the Dhamma to someone who is not interested in the Dhamma, then to him that becomes frivolous speech and it annoys him. Just like the little story that you probably heard, that it's not a good idea to try to teach a pig to sing. Because it frustrates the teacher and it annoys the pig. Well, that's the same thing with trying to teach Dharma to ordinary pigs, ordinary people rather, is that it annoys them. So don't try to teach the Dharma. What we can do to spread the Dharma instead is just being friendly to them. Now friendly does not mean critical. So when a new person is trying to learn the Dhamma, or a little bit interested in it, and starts asking really stupid questions, it's actually not a good idea to tell them that their questions are stupid. Instead, why? Because it's going to annoy them. Don't annoy people. Let's be friends with them instead. That in fact If we can then take that two-tiered system of inside the Dharma, or inside the Sangha rather, versus outside, that we in fact can point things out to one another without it being criticism, but in fact it's a learning tool. So when somebody says something, oh, this is true about the Dharma, then we can take that. But if it's coming from a person on the outside, that they're just saying something critical, out of the ordinary, we can say, oh, well, that's just something that comes out of the mouth of an annoyed pig. We don't have to listen to it. But we can in fact take criticism easily and happily because within the Sangha we are friends with one another. So this concept of being able to make a distinction between who is worthy of talking to the Dhamma is a very valuable thing. Now, uh, I'll give an example of that, that, um, my good friend, uh, Cathal, uh, I don't know his Pali name, but he's been ordained now for a couple of years. He started a Discord group and invited me on with the idea— the name of it, by the way, is Happy Gamer— and that the Happy Gamer group was, uh, originally with the idea of teaching people who come into the group, to teach them the Dharma. Well, what happened was, is a lot of people would join that group and they had no interest in the Dharma. And so when we're trying to teach the Dharma to ordinary people who are not interested in the Dharma, that would be like the quote from Jesus: don't throw your pearls to the swine. There's that pig reference again. Okay, don't annoy the pigs with the Dharma. I've had many people ask me, well, I've gotten so much out of the Dharma, how do I share it with others? The answer is be careful, because when you do share it, many people will consider that frivolous speech and they're not interested in it. And so, Ivan, I'm glad you're back on. I wanted to say thank you, sir, for your criticism of showing me that in fact the Happy Gamers group had changed, that it's not a Dharma group, that it's an ordinary people's group. Most of the people who come on are not interested in the Dhamma, and so they become annoyed when they hear the Dhamma. And so since I'm only really interested in teaching and talking about the Dharma, that's not a very good place for me, though it was originally because it was set up by a monk and had the intention. But now we can see that in fact it's not a Dhamma group and that is only— all we're going to do is annoy people. And so it's better not to teach the Dharma there. And so thank you, Ivan, for that criticism. I very much appreciate it, and I thought I'd give you the airtime in public to let you know that. So do you have anything to say?

**Speaker B:** Um, yeah, I, uh, I was, uh, having some thoughts on that.

**Speaker A:** Uh, Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Actually, I think a question to what you just said. Well, I was just thinking out loud, because originally I kind of got into the Dharma because Katta was just hanging on your porch. He just sit there on a video call. Talking about just wholesome thoughts and meditation and stuff like that. I don't really even know what Dharma is, and I was just there listening. And then, you know, like, it's just a very, very, very casual setting. And I slowly, slowly got interested. So yeah, I was thinking like the ordinary Happy Gamers server would be nice if it goes back to that sort of route, like it's just very casual. And if people somehow got interested, you know, like me, they would hopefully want to know more. So yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well, you just recently mentioned, Ivan, about Alex and actually wanted me to talk about it. And that the thing that I would say about Alex is, is that he actually has his own server and that he and I have discussed that.

**Speaker C:** That.

**Speaker A:** The some of the channels on his server are actually a pack of wild horses. And they're not interested in the Dharma at all. And yet he, being a happy Dharma dude, is capable of putting up with that because he does not have the agenda that I have. My agenda is Dhamma, Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, and that's the only thing that I'm really interested in. And I will say offhand also that I have, because of ill health and old age, have kind of withdrawn and they're not teaching so much anymore. But your point about Alex is, is that even though he's really steeped in the Dhamma and cares about the Dhamma, he's quite willing to interact with people without trying to change them, correct them, or teach them Dhamma. But he's quite happy to let the pigs oink, and he doesn't try to teach them to sing the Dhamma. And I think that that's an admirable quality. And that I would invite everyone on this group to begin to see things that way also. That's a much better way of seeing things, is that you're not there to annoy the pigs with the Dhamma, that you're there instead to spread your joy, to spread your happiness, to be friendly with people. That's the only thing that we really have to do, is to spread our joy. And so this is basically then what we could say, that the hallmark then of the Sotapanna is that they are joyful, that they spread joy, that they're friendly, that that's actually because they've taken refuge in the Triple Gem, including taking refuge in the Sangha, or taking refuge in friendship. And also, because they're friendly, they don't annoy people, they don't harm them, they don't mess with their partners, they don't lie or gossip. And most importantly, they don't use the frivolous speech of the Dhamma to annoy their friends. They let their friends do whatever the friend wants to do. If they're wanting to use very low-class language, that's okay. Let them use the low-class language. If they want to be unhappy, that's okay. Let them be unhappy, but let them not get you stuck in their unhappiness, either to try to pull them out of their unhappiness or to become unhappy yourself. That your job is to remain happy. That's the very best compassion that there is. Now, the Buddha used a technique that I see in some of the suttas some of the time, where the Buddha did just this, that he would let us say, let the pigs oink and he would oink a bit along with them. Many, many people then misunderstand that, that by saying, oh, well, that the Buddha puts up with pig oinks, that makes him a pig too. No, that's just a beginner's way of looking at it. And so when the Buddha puts up with talk of rebirth and reincarnation and magic and things like this, Just because the Buddha will put up with it doesn't mean that he believes in it. A clear example, and this example happens over and over and over again in the suttas, where Ananda was really heavy-duty into rebirth and reincarnation, and the Buddha worked almost his entire late career trying to move Ananda out of that. But he never was able to do it. And so when Ananda would come to the Buddha and says, oh, that nun over there just died. Where is she going? What is her rebirth? And the Buddha would explain that because she had come this far in the Dhamma, that more than likely she would not end up in hell or she would wind up in some heavenly state. But always the Buddha would point out to him is that it's the state of the mind. And if you look at someone clearly and carefully enough, you can see what state they're in. You don't have to go ask the Buddha about it. You can see where they are yourself. And also in the time of the Buddha, he gave permission to the lay folks to announce to each other whether or not they had reached that state of Srotapanna or not. But there's no reason to say it or state it. One can merely talk about it from the sense of the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha, and the precepts. Or we can talk about it from the understanding of personality view And fetas, like the one that they didn't mention, was the feta of doubt. Now, what we mean by the feta of doubt is knowledge and vision of what is the path, or what is the way to spend this moment, moment by moment, for the rest of our lives. What is our pathway? What is the way that we want to live? And most people in the world are in doubt about this. They don't really know which way to go. Because the future is uncertain. But when we understand that the Eightfold Noble Path is in fact, and we take refuge in the Dharma of the Eightfold Noble Path, then we know precisely and for sure what is the path and what is not the path to spend our time. So when someone becomes a Srotapanna, It's because of their enthusiasm and their caring for the Dharma, not because they've had some sort of mystical state or experience. It's because of their dedication to the Dharma. Now, what has happened kind of worldwide, but this is— and you see it in Asia, but you can see it especially in Western Buddhism, where they're very goal-oriented. Attainment-oriented, and people get the idea, well, I spent all of this 2 years or more of my time practicing the Dharma and paying very high fees for it. I should be able to get some attainment out of it. And so the teacher will come by and say, yes, you're a Srotapanna. Well, the Srotapanna is not something that's bestowed like a diploma. It's something that grows from within an individual, and that we can treat everyone in the Dharma group, in the Dharma friends, as if they were already Sotapanna, simply because they already have this refuge. They take refuge in the teaching, they take refuge in the result of the teaching, and they take refuge in the friends that they make within the practice. But that doesn't mean then that we're not capable of also remaining in a friendly state even in the face of great bullshit. That you will have to deal with great bullshit. Can you do that happily? This is the real hallmark of the Srotapanna, is that they could put up with all kinds of ordinary people and do so happily without either becoming unhappy or joining the pity party or trying to change them. We can just let them be and we can enjoy their company happily, no matter how stupid, no matter how bad they oink, We could just leave them alone. We don't have to fix them. So that's what we mean then by the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha. And in this regard, we can say that we can turn that thing around in the sense that the Buddha and the Dharma does not come first. Sangha comes first. Friendship comes first. It comes first in chronological order. And it comes first in importance. That when we have the friendship, that when we are friends, we are already fulfilling the Dharma in the sense of the Dukkha and Nirodha. When we are friendly and have friendships, where is the Dukkha, where is the dissatisfaction? When we try to teach the pig to sing, there's where the Dukkha is, and it's on both sides. It annoys the pig and it frustrates the teacher. So let's not share the Dharma. This is a question that people have asked me many times. How do I teach the Dharma to all the people that I know? The answer to that: don't even try. Be friends instead. Share your happiness. Give them a happy smile. Until they actually become interested. If they start asking you questions, something like, why are you happy all the time? The answer is, is because I trained to be happy. If you're interested in the training, we can teach you what the training is so that you too— in other words, if you remain noble in public, then you're already introducing people to the Buddha, Because there you are, the happy Buddha. You're already introducing the Buddha when you are in fact the Buddha, when you are in fact the happy camper. You're teaching them the Dharma right then and there. Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Why? Because you're showing them that they don't have to be in the state of Dukkha. They can join you in the Dukkha, Nirodha. And so this is the way to teach the Dharma without having to go through all the details and all the Pali and all the suttas and everything like that. It's actually quite simple. So let's finish now. Arahant, what do you have to say?

**Speaker D:** I didn't have you back then, Dhammarato, but when I first started, you know, kind of the same path as most people, you know, banging my head against the wall. And I think people at that stage share the Dhamma. I know I did because I was very annoying about it, um, but I think I did it because it reinforced the Dharma doesn't have a lot of belief, but it needs belief initially. So it's almost like we're talking about it.

**Speaker A:** It doesn't require belief. Right. That Pali word Shraddha is better translated as confidence and not faith or belief. Let us give the word belief and faith to the Christians because they need those words, but let's not use them in the sense that you can't just say, oh, I believe in the Buddha, but I've never met anyone who was noble enough to qualify. No, we actually need to have someone, we need some teacher, we need some monk, we need someone who has practiced the Dharma well enough so that they can display, they can show you that this is what it's all about. In other words, you can only learn joy from a joyful, happy person. You could believe in joy, but if you've never seen it, then even though you have faith in it, that faith is not strong enough to actually get you to practice.

**Speaker D:** So I think I was hard-headed enough. I didn't have a Sangha. I didn't have, like I said, you. So I would just do a lot of retreats and whatnot. Annoying, right? Just kind of, I guess, one of being stubborn is one of the benefits there is because I'm like, the Buddha said it's done. Let me just dedicate all of my time to it, which I did, and let's see what happens. Stumble along. And then I remember, I think I was again on a home retreat, just hanging out on a Tuesday, and I was just sitting there meditating. And then I was like, done. I felt I no longer needed to talk about the Dharma. It's absolute— I can't even explain it now, but There was never all doubt, all concerns about the Dhamma. It's hard to like, you know, have that kind of confidence in the Dharma, I think, until it happens. But once you do have that confidence, there's nothing that can shake it. It's almost like it stabilizes you. And I never spoke about the Dharma for, I think, 1 or 2 years with any of my friends, where I used to annoy them all the time.

**Speaker A:** I didn't care.

**Speaker D:** I already got what I wanted in the sense, and I felt confident in it. I just enjoyed myself having that confidence and kind of strength in the Dharma. So this is why I do wonder. I was looking up if the Buddha ever set any restriction. I wanted to ask you with the monks. Is there like some kind of restriction who can teach the Dharma? Like when you were as a monk with Buddhadasa, or did the Buddha ever say like Srotapanna or Sakadagami or whatever, that's who can teach lay people?

**Speaker A:** Okay, yes, there is a tradition. And the tradition is that a monk cannot take new monks and be their teacher until he's been a monk for 10 years. But that 10 years is not a calendar 10 years. It has more to do with becoming steeped in the Dharma. Now, there are other qualifications, and that is that when someone becomes a Srotapanna, they become the best teachers. And Bhikkhu Buddhadasa had a different criteria, which is actually a little bit lower than that, when he says is that someone at least understands and has in-depth knowledge of Paticcasamuppada or dependent origination. Well, if you put those things together, You can see that in fact we need to understand Paticcasamuppada or dependent origination in order to be able to take refuge in the Dharma. To really get into it requires that. Okay, so those are three different ways of looking at it. But there's a better way of doing it. And this is something that I hold really important, and that is that One is not a teacher of the Dharma until the lineage that he is in anoints him as a teacher. Now, that leaves the idea that there are an awful lot of Dharma teachers out there who cannot trace their lineage back into the Samma Sangha or Tisha back. So Bhikkhu Buddhadasa actually put me up to teaching, and Achan Po has put me up to teaching. In fact, to be honest with you, I probably wouldn't teach unless they had designated me to do this. However, there are those who have come and spent a few months, maybe ordained for a short time, and then they think that they've got enough Dharma and they go back to the West and they open an institute, they open a retreat center. And now there's an entire system there to where you have the blind leading the blind. They haven't put the time in the Sangha of 10 years. They haven't had a senior Buddhist monk anoint them as a teacher. They've just out there teaching the Dharma. And that's what's happened with Western Buddhism. And I can name names, but let me just kick butts. And in that regard is, is that unless someone can point back to who was their teacher, what Asian teacher that they had, that in fact Zen is even worse than we have in the Theravada because the guys have what they call a lay ordination where they get a name, they dress up in these monk-like clothes, but they really don't have a clue about the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha. They really haven't taken refuge in their heart. What they've done is opened a bank account. And that's the problem with Western Buddhism, is it has become a business. And that if you are actually teaching out of friendliness, then it's always taught free. Do you actually charge? I mean, in the US they have a bit of this, but it's not a common thing to where you actually have to buy and pay a salary to people to be your friend. Very wealthy people often do this simply because they're not friendly in the first place, and so they don't have friends because of their friendliness. They have friends because they pay for it. Okay, so friendliness is actually an exchange that's freely given. Also, the Dharma is freely given. The way that Ajahn Po described it to me is that the Dharma is priceless. Do not devalue it by putting a sum on it. That it has to be given for free. It has to be given openly. It has to be given through friendship, through kindness, not through some certificate process. So that would be who could qualify as a teacher. And I would say then that the best place for one to find a real qualified teacher is in a monastery, in a wat. The abbot of the wat would be a good teacher, but not a retreat center. Don't go to a retreat center thinking you're going to find the Buddha there. You won't. Don't go to a retreat center thinking you're going to find Dharma there. What you're going to find is a mesh of psychology and hard work. So I don't generally recommend people going to retreats. What I recommend instead is that they go find a noble. Now, what I mean by that is, is that let's use the example of making a fire. There's the old standard way was when the fire goes out in our hovel, we go to the hovel next door and borrow a few coals and bring them back, blow on them, and get them hot again. Nowadays, what we normally do is we use a spark. And so if you can find somebody who sparks, that's the place to get the Dhamma. But what you'll find in Western Buddhism instead is people trying to rub two sticks together, and they call that meditation. And then they rub and they rub and they rub and they rub and they rub, and it gets warm, but it never sets on fire. And so find someone who actually has that noble spark. That's the Shraddha. Don't take it on faith. And so rubbing two sticks together is the faith, as opposed to finding someone who can actually give you a hot coal or give you the spark to start your tinder. So, Arrow, what do you think about that?

**Speaker D:** It makes a lot of sense. I think it's much easier now too, especially with the internet. Back then it was a lot harder to find— like, I don't remember how I even found you. I think it was some random back of a corner 10 years ago. But I agree, I think one thing that definitely helped was stumbling into Jhana by accident.

**Speaker A:** And.

**Speaker D:** When people, I think, experience that quenching for the first time, it's like nothing they've ever thought they could experience. It's almost unconditioned. I didn't have to do anything. And then they lose it because they don't know how, like the conditions for it.

**Speaker A:** And then they want it again. And now they're wanting something they can't have. And they wonder why they can't get to Jhana a second time. It's because they've added a magic ingredient called a bucket of water, desire.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I mean, yeah, unless you have somebody teaching you or showing you like, you know, not to do that, that's the first thing you do, you like try to like smother it. So I do wonder like, I feel like maybe somebody should experience have an experience of Jhana before, and they could probably then talk about the Dharma. I mean, I, you know, I think that would have some of that confidence. It wouldn't have the unwavering confidence, I think, like at a Srotapanna, where it's even if all of the Dharma disappeared, it's unwavering still. Like, but I think So, you know, as experience of Jhana, it's almost like, oh, there's something here. This isn't like all pure faith and magic. This is like unbelievable, you know, like bliss and joy initially. And then, you know, it kind of calms down and you learn to manage it. So I don't know, would that be a requirement? I feel like that should be a requirement, at least a little bit, having some kind of experience of Jhana. For you to speak about that.

**Speaker A:** You're saying that there's two ways then to do it. One of them is to follow the instructions of the Dhamma and follow those instructions to arrive at the state of Jhana, which, by the way, is nothing more than really feeling good and knowing it. And you're feeling really good and knowing it because you're free from all of the stuff that you've done that prevents you from being really happy and joyful. Okay, or you can go for the happy and joyfulness without understanding the Dharma, but our society doesn't approve of that. Then in fact, every— you could say it like this— every 3-year-old is a little Buddha, and they're sacrificed on the altar of school. Never mind how good you feel, do something. Do what you're told to do. Hello, Scott, you come in late. Good to see you, friend.

**Speaker C:** Hello.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, good to see you.

**Speaker A:** And so that, that natural joy that you're talking about, Earl, we all have that ability But most of us confuse that joyfulness with getting what we want, as opposed to the joy of being satisfied with what we already have. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about that in a book called Happiness and Hunger. There are two kinds of happiness. One is the happiness of getting something that we want, And the other happiness is not wanting anything. That's the real happiness. And so real Jhana is hard to come by without correct practice, because we have to understand that the real Jhana comes from being satisfied with the way things are. And that can happen naturally, but it doesn't happen consistently and it doesn't happen often. But it can happen.

**Speaker D:** I will say, I do think maybe because you've done this a long time, by unconditioning you enter into Jhana. But it's amazing. Like if you've entered Jhana and retained it, you can't sleep at night. You're just like, initially electricity is like running through your fingers and you're going on 3, 4 hours of sleep and you feel amazing. You know, it's, it really is unbelievable, right?

**Speaker A:** Stay awake, stay awake, watch what's going on. This stuff is too good to miss.

**Speaker D:** Exactly. Yeah, every moment is just, uh, it's magical.

**Speaker A:** So Ben, would you chime in on this discussion? What do you have to say? Dan, are you there? All right, let's go to RJ. RJ, what do you have to say?

**Speaker E:** Uh, I, I'm not Earlier, I think sharing the Dharma with people, I think as I'm a beginner, I also tried to tell people around and found that not everybody will be interested and it will annoy them. But at the same time, I find that I really don't have to tell. They do see the change in me and then they get interested. I think people who really, you know, will be taking the Dharma, they will ask about it. They will, you know, they will figure it out as they come in the company. I actually found it very intentionally because in life, some ups and downs, and I was looking for ways to handle that. I asked many people, all my friends, and one of the friends, Amit, I asked him, and he then gave me kind of a little glimpse into it. And over the months, then I started attending your calls and watching. For a long time, I just watched your videos. So I think people who want it, they will find it.

**Speaker A:** Actually, you probably heard the old, old cliché or story that when the student is ready, the teacher will appear. Have you ever heard of that?

**Speaker E:** No, but it sounds perfectly correct.

**Speaker A:** Okay, it's not magic though. What it is, is that when the student actually becomes a student, when he becomes a seeker, when he begins to look for the path, he's probably going to run across someone who can assist him. Yeah, that's, that's it. That, that is not a matter of the teacher appears, it's a matter of that the student, because he is a student, can now finally recognize this guy as a teacher.

**Speaker E:** Yep, yep.

**Speaker A:** Because they want to know it. And if they haven't come to that state yet, if they don't want to know, then they're just a pig. Don't throw your pearls to the swine. That's the issue that the teacher, I guess, has to learn is don't teach someone who doesn't want to know. It's just frivolous talk to them. It annoys them. But when somebody really does want to hear, then they will listen because they hear what you have to say is being valuable, right? So Potato, what do you think? Ben, you got your microphone on now. Yeah, it's like they say, seek and ye shall find.

**Speaker B:** And if people aren't seeking, then they're not really normally going to stumble across the path. Like, if they're looking for it, you.

**Speaker A:** Can point them in the right direction.

**Speaker B:** And as you say, like, in the.

**Speaker A:** Group, if all of us were happy already, we wouldn't have found the group.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, teach the people who want to be taught and show them the way.

**Speaker A:** You're correct. So Christina, what do you have to say?

**Speaker F:** Only just to say that I appreciate all the teachings that you've shared. And that everyone's experiences help, helps provide guidance. And then reading the suttas also, and just to learn from others but not compare your experience to others, because then I felt myself for a while there feeling like I needed to I wasn't doing it right. I wasn't practicing right. I didn't experience that thing. And then once I kind of eased off and kind of just— So you.

**Speaker A:** Were going by some sort of rule that you should feel a certain way because you heard about other people.

**Speaker F:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so that's actually not correct practice. But I'm glad that you figured that out, that you can throw away the rule about how you should feel. And begin to feel the way you want to feel.

**Speaker F:** Right, just take it easy.

**Speaker A:** So Mikey, or Mickey, what do you have to say? He's not there. How about you, Tenpo Arhat Hazmat? This is your first time. Do you have something to say now?

**Speaker C:** Yes. I'm just really happy to be a part of it. I wish everyone success and happiness and health. You know, I feel great that the techniques are definitely working well for me. I find communication with people about Dharma, I don't think it's that difficult once I break it down to ordinary things, because that's what it kind of comes down to for me, is ordinary things. Like, I'd be happy to talk to people about such things like friendliness and stuff, and maybe some of them have a debate about, you know, when there's a time to be friendly or time to be unfriendly. Then you can sort of get into like the whole business about attitudes and mind states without necessarily using Dhamma terms or tell them that we're talking about Buddhism. So that's pretty much my take about communicating Dhamma. It's, you know, you just break it down to ordinary things that everyone has experience with.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. A lot of people in the West, because they've had some introduction to some religion or another, They tend to see the teaching of the Buddha as just another religion. And religions generally have a huge belief system, a great big pile of crap. And so we all— and I know everyone here has done it. I did it in the original. I thought that, oh, there's just so much to the Dharma. This just is so big, it's so complicated. And it took me a long time to figure out that I was looking at it wrong. It's not big and complicated, it's downright simple. Really is. There's nothing to it other than learning to become friends with yourself, really good friends, to be nurturing, to allow yourself to feel the way that you want to feel, as opposed to following some set of rules or instructions. And so it's really easy, but you have to practice. That, in fact, it's the practice that helps you to understand how really easy it actually is. If we start off with, oh, it's complicated, and I gotta find this, that, and the other thing, I gotta have all the information before I start practice— which would be the way, I guess, that you would go camping. You've got to know all the camping equipment. No, you don't. All you have to do is just go camping, and when you need something, you'll figure out how to use it. That's the way to do it, is to see that everything is really, really simple, and all we have to do is practice. And as we practice, we can see that it's not complicated at all, that in fact where the complication comes from is from ignorance. If we are ignorant about something, then we think it must be very complicated because, well, I'm smart, I can figure that out. And if I can't figure it out, it must be because it's really, really complicated. No, it's not really complicated. In fact, it's complicated because I'm making it complicated because I don't understand. But once I start practice, I can see how easy it actually is. So Scott, yes, go ahead.

**Speaker D:** They have one thing on that is, this sounds magical, but the Dhamma, like, if you don't understand some of the suttas, with practice, like, it reveals itself. It's, I don't know, somehow some of the experience has shown. But I remember one of the funny things that happened was lying became hard. Not that I couldn't lie, but it became weird from one day to the next. Where not just like big lies or anything like that, I remember I was telling a story I've said 20, 30 times, 100 times as a joke, you know. And as I was telling the story The part that I embellish a little bit, you know, just for the jokes and the laugh, as I was about to say it, I just stopped in the middle of the story and just stopped talking for about a second or two. And I was just looking around and people were looking at me and I was like, I don't know. So I just said the story normally and I didn't try to get a reaction out of them. And I was like, that was strange. So every time, like, a part of the story that I would normally repeat and the embellishing parts, every time I was coming up to it, I couldn't embellish it. Like, it felt like flat. And I was like, and then I just got over it and just said the story normally. I'm like, that was strange. So I was looking around, I was like, you know, stuff about the suttas. And you can't lie easily when you practice the Dharma. It's not that you're even practicing the hard, it just Somehow that becomes the new way you interact without even doing anything.

**Speaker A:** Right. Professional comedians call it delivery. You have to be able to deliver a joke. And that means that the best way to deliver a joke is with friendliness.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, and honesty.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Uh-huh. So, Scott, good to see you, friend.

**Speaker C:** Good to see you. How you doing?

**Speaker A:** Hello. Salutations. Everything is just fine.

**Speaker B:** Great. Good to hear.

**Speaker A:** So, Mikey— wait a minute, one more. Anna, good to see you, Anna. Anna and Earl, you have something in common. And that is, is that you build rapport with people before you kick them in the ass. So, Anna, do you have something to say? No, just thank you. Beautiful, Dhammarato. Beautiful teaching as usual. Ah, okay. So, Mikey, why don't you take this thing away?

**Speaker G:** Gladly. Yes, thanks, friends, for being here today. For those of you watching this on YouTube, check out the video description. We have a link to join the Dharma Friends Discord. Also, for those of you here, if you'd like to invite other people, you can copy that link and send it to them. And that's a nice way to kind of introduce people to the Dhamma. Without you having to sit in the teacher's seat or see yourself as any kind of teacher at all. Just say, hey, maybe you can check out the Dhamma Friends Discord. So yeah, also, if you want to listen to these talks, you can do so on Spotify, iTunes, or any of the other podcasting platforms. And y'all are welcome to check out the opensanghafoundation.org. Where there's a map with many wats listed on it. There's many resources, all sorts of fun things to play around with and check out there. So yeah, thanks for being here today, friends. Take it easy. Don't worry, be happy.

**Speaker A:** Don't worry, be happy. Be happy with each other. This is for a community. This is not a top-down or one-on-one like that, but it's really a group. So I recommend that you make friends with one another. One-on-one calls. We have a channel where you can call each other and share the Dhammas and become more friends, close friends with folks. So as we finish this talk, I would suggest that people stay on this call and meet each other, talk to each other, become friends with one another. Some of us here are what Mikey calls seasoned practitioners. Me, I'm salty. I'm the salty dog. But we've got people who are sweet and flowery and spicy and all kinds of things. And so join us here and hang out on this group while I take a hike. So thank you all for coming. Thank you so much. I very much appreciate each one of you becoming friends of mine. May you become friends with one another also.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, Dhammarato.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A), reinterprets the traditional **Triple Gem (Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha)** by placing **friendship and friendliness** at the very heart of the practice. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Thesis: Friendship is the Entire Practice**
*   The talk challenges the conventional, ritualistic understanding of taking refuge. Instead, it proposes that the essence of the Triple Gem and the Precepts is **cultivating universal friendliness (metta)**.
*   Dhammarato cites a sutta where the Buddha states friendship is not half, but **the entire holy life**. The Precepts (non-harming, not stealing, etc.) are thus reframed as guidelines for **being a good friend** to all beings.

### **Reordering the Triple Gem: Sangha First**
*   The traditional order (Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha) is flipped. **Sangha (community/friendship) is presented as both the chronological and practical starting point.**
*   The path is re-described as:
    1.  **Sangha:** Associating with noble, joyful friends (the "spark").
    2.  **Buddha:** Seeing the embodiment of the teaching in those joyful people.
    3.  **Dhamma:** Hearing, practicing, and ultimately understanding the teachings through that friendship.

### **Practical Application: How to "Share" the Dhamma**
*   A major theme is **how to spread the Dhamma without being annoying.** The answer: **Don't teach it directly to those not interested.**
*   Using the analogy "don't try to teach a pig to sing," the talk advises against proselytizing. Forcing Dhamma talk on someone is considered "frivolous speech" if it annoys them.
*   The true way to share the Dhamma is to **embody it:** be joyful, friendly, and happy. When people ask *why* you are so happy, *then* you can explain the training. Your joyful presence itself becomes the teaching of the end of suffering (dukkha nirodha).

### **Characteristics of a Stream-Enterer (Sotapanna)**
*   A Sotapanna is defined not by mystical experience, but by **unshakable confidence in the path** and a **joyful, friendly disposition**.
*   Their hallmark is the ability to remain happy and friendly even in the face of "great bullshit" from the world, without feeling the need to fix others or join in their negativity.

### **Critique of Western Buddhism**
*   The talk criticizes some Western Buddhist models for being too **goal-oriented, commercialized, and attainment-focused**.
*   True Dhamma should be given freely through friendship, not sold in retreat centers. A qualified teacher should be **steeped in the Dhamma**, understand dependent origination, and ideally be **designated by a legitimate lineage**, not self-appointed.

### **The Simplicity of the Path**
*   The Dhamma is ultimately **simple**, not complicated. The complexity comes from our own ignorance.
*   The core practice is **learning to be a true friend to yourself**—nurturing, allowing yourself to feel good, and letting go of harsh internal rules and standards. This internal friendliness naturally extends outward.
*   As one deepens practice, virtuous behavior (like the difficulty of lying) becomes natural and effortless, not a rule to follow.

### **Community Emphasis**
*   The talk concludes by emphasizing the importance of building **one-on-one friendships within the Sangha**. The community is not a passive audience but an active network of friends supporting each other's practice.

In essence, this talk reframes Buddhism as a **practice of radical friendliness**, where the Sangha is the foundation, joy is the method, and embodying happiness is the most powerful teaching one can offer.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, the speaker uses several key metaphors and stories to illustrate the teachings on the Triple Gem (Triratna), friendliness, and sharing the Dharma. Here are the main ones:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **Safe Harbor / Refuge:** The Triple Gem (Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha) is described as a "safe harbor" or "refuge" from the dangers and potential "hell states" of life.
2.  **Moving Target:** The self is compared to a "moving target," emphasizing the teaching of *anatta* (not-self) and impermanence. We are not a fixed entity but are constantly changing, so defining a static "self" is futile.
3.  **Pole Vaulting:** Used to criticize setting impossibly high personal standards and moral rules. We set the bar (the world record) so high without the proper run-up or pole (skillful means) that we just "land flat on our face in failure." The alternative is to be satisfied where you are.
4.  **Teaching a Pig to Sing:** This humorous metaphor is used repeatedly to illustrate the folly of forcing the Dharma on unwilling listeners. It "annoys the pig and frustrates the teacher." The lesson is to avoid "frivolous speech" (annoying others with Dharma talk) and instead simply be friendly.
5.  **Pearls Before Swine:** Referencing a saying attributed to Jesus, this reinforces the "pig" metaphor. Don't throw the precious pearls of the Dharma to those who cannot appreciate them ("swine").
6.  **Spark vs. Rubbing Sticks:** Finding a true teacher is compared to getting a "spark" or "hot coal" to start a fire (ignite your practice). "Western Buddhism" is criticized as being like people trying to start a fire by endlessly "rubbing two sticks together" through effortful meditation—it may get warm but never ignites.
7.  **Wild Horses:** A chaotic, non-Dharma-interested online community is described as a "pack of wild horses," highlighting the need for discernment about where to engage in Dharma discussion.
8.  **Salty Dog:** The speaker humorously refers to himself as a "salty dog," implying he's a seasoned, experienced practitioner.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **The Buddha and Ananda on Rebirth:** The speaker recounts how Ananda was fixated on questions of rebirth and where deceased people would be reborn. The Buddha would answer pragmatically but used these questions to point Ananda toward observing the *state of mind* rather than speculative metaphysics. This story illustrates the Buddha's skill in teaching without endorsing beliefs.
2.  **Personal Story: The "Happy Gamer" Discord Group:** The speaker shares a personal anecdote about a Discord group started by a monk friend. Initially intended as a Dharma space, it attracted people with no interest in the Dharma. Trying to teach there became an exercise in annoying people ("teaching pigs to sing"), leading the speaker to withdraw. This story is a practical example of knowing your audience.
3.  **Personal Story: Alex's Server:** The story of "Alex" is offered as a positive counter-example. Alex, steeped in Dharma, manages a server with "wild horses" (non-Dharma channels) without trying to teach or change them. He "lets the pigs oink" and simply spreads joy and friendliness, which the speaker admires.
4.  **Arahant's Story of Lying:** A participant ("Arahant") shares a personal story about how, after deep practice, he found he could no longer casually embellish stories or tell even small "joke" lies. The act felt flat and unnatural. This anecdote illustrates how ethical behavior (the precepts) becomes natural and effortless through practice, not through following rules.
5.  **The Student Ready, The Teacher Appears:** The speaker references this common cliché but demystifies it. It's not magic; when a person genuinely becomes a seeker ("a student"), they develop the capacity to *recognize* a true teacher. This shifts the focus to the readiness of the student, not the appearance of the teacher.

### **Core Conceptual Metaphor**
Underlying the entire talk is a powerful **conceptual metaphor:**
*   **THE DHARMA IS FRIENDLINESS.** The speaker re-frames the entire teaching. The Triple Gem, the precepts, and the path are all expressions of *friendliness* (Sanskrit: *maitrī*). Taking refuge in the Sangha is taking refuge in friendship. The precepts are guidelines for friendly behavior. The ultimate goal is to be a joyful, friendly presence—a "happy Buddha"—which in itself is the most effective teaching. This metaphor is used to simplify and unify the complex system of Buddhist practice.
