### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, starting. There we go. So anyway, today is Friday evening for you guys. Welcome to the Sangha chat. I'm sure that a couple more will join in time this evening. And we had already got started to talk about the relationship between psychology and the Dharma. And also you asked the question about day-to-day things. And the word thing caught my attention in the sense that the word Dhamma in the Pali actually referred to in common language that the Buddha used and picked this word up. I mean, he had to speak in the language of the day. But the original definition of the word Dhamma just meant the word like thing or that. And so words like Dhammakaya means the whole body of the Dhamma or everything. You could also say the Buddha Dhamma then is the Buddha's thing. So when you're talking about then day-to-day things, you're talking about day-to-day Dhamma. Which is the Buddhist thing.

**Speaker B:** That's perfect.

**Speaker A:** That in fact, it is very Western meditation mentality. And I think part of that has to do with using the word retreat, that we make meditation a big deal. And then in fact, the word meditation doesn't even belong in the vocabulary. That meditation is something that has a word that's been borrowed from Catholicism. But what they're doing is not exactly the same thing that we're doing in the sense that, yes, there is one quality of meditation that is similar, and that is over and over again, practice, or spending time at doing it. And this is really all about skill development, or practice, over and over and over again. We practice the same thing over and over and over again. But in fact, if you begin to listen to the recordings that I do, I just say a few things, but it takes hours and hours to say a few things because I say them over and over and over again. Because that's, that's one of the major teachings, is that we have been spending many, many hundreds of thousands of mind moments rehearsing unhappiness. We have been talking to ourselves, um, on a moment-by-moment basis into feeling bad, and now it's time to practice talking ourselves into feeling good. This is the major teaching of the Buddha, but it's hidden inside the language of Dukkha, Anicca, and Nirodha. But we can see it actually when we look right there, that Dukkha is in fact that repetition of telling ourselves that we are dissatisfied with things, and we go around looking for things to be dissatisfied with. Ah, Robert, welcome. So, um, well, now it's, it's time to practice over and over and over again, practice talking ourselves into feeling good, which are different than aspirations or the power of positive thinking. Now, positive thinking does have a lot of power, but it does not necessarily— positive always means wholesome. For example, a can-do attitude that we can really get the right plans and the right tools and the right group of people to break into the right bank and get the right money. Now, that's positive thinking, but it's not wholesome. You see what I mean? It's not wholesome thought to break into a bank, but we can have positive thoughts about get her done. So let's look at more positive thoughts. Another way of looking at it is that oftentimes positive thoughts are not real. They're aspirations, or we want something. So in fact, we actually practice talking to ourselves about things that we don't have that we should have. That's the danger of aspirations, that we actually are talking ourselves into feeling bad, just like we always have, but now we're using positive aspirations to feel bad. And also being dissatisfied with what we do have. Many times students have said, oh well, I've been practicing joy like you said, but it never was enough. I really didn't feel it. Okay, so they did have joy, but it wasn't satisfying, it wasn't good enough, it was somehow fake. Or ponee, put them. See, they're tearing it down, they're destroying it. We're just— those are the normal kinds of thoughts that we've been having our whole lives. We are taught to think that way from society. That in fact, a good way for it to be expressed is, is that who am I? I am the sum total of all the malicious gossip and lies that I have been told my whole life. That's who I am. And so when we recognize that it's time to make a change, one of the most important things that we want to do is to really take a look at what's going on, to recognize that that's what's really going on, is who I am is just what I've been told to be. I was a musician because my daddy told me to be. But also I became electronic because my daddy showed me how to do that. He wanted me to be a musician, but he showed me what to do by his own professions, including projections and tape recorders and all that kind of stuff. And so when we realize that that the way that we live is a habit pattern that we have picked up and we repeat it over and over and over and over and over again, that now is the time to make a change, is to wake up to that stuff and recognizing that we can make a change, that we can actually think thoughts that are worthy of thinking and feel the feelings that are associated with that, that we literally can learn to feel the way that we want to feel. Rather than feeling the way that we were taught to feel. Now, feeling itself comes in instinctually. The ability to feel is built in, but what to feel has been sort of educated into us, including the way that we teach children how to read. Learn your ABCs, but then we fuss at them when they forget letters. Or get them backwards. They can't read and they're slow. And so the children don't want to learn to read because it's painful, it takes work, and they're unsuccessful in it. So we as children then grow up with the attitude of, I'll do what I'm told to do, but I don't want to do it. And so we have resentment and revenge built in and all kinds of other stuff that sometimes leads into rebellion. Or guilt. And so you can see how all of that stuff gets fixed in because we don't teach our children to enjoy what they're doing. But the problem is, is that I can say that one time and it does nobody any good. Everybody can agree with what I'm saying. The problem is, is that they don't practice it. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I was just going to say, um, This specifically is something I've thought about a lot, and also with my partner, tried to practice. We've been trying to practice with our children. And, you know, it seems to me that— I don't know if this is the same thing, but just in their natural state, they're, you know, children are more in the moment. They're more like, if I think of my 6-year-old, like, he will be so engrossed in what he's doing that,

**Speaker A:** you

**Speaker B:** know, he's lost to everything outside of the world and everything that is outside of that moment of what he's doing. And that's like all that matters in that moment. And so you know, whereas I think as you, like, as you grow, and if you go through the traditional education system, then that kind of changes, and you start to— and I don't know if it's just because of the system, or if it's because of the society, or if it's just, you know, I don't know if this is related, but it just made me think that it seems that the natural state, at least for children, is to be in in the moment.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, and sometimes engrossed in the moment.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. This reminds me of something that we can pursue in, and we start off with it in the sense of you have probably heard stories about a Zen stick. Do you know what a Zen stick is?

**Speaker B:** I, I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Okay, it's about a meter-long piece of a bamboo, less than an inch thick, so that it's very handy to carry like a walking stick. And about halfway down through that stick, there's a slit that's been shaved out so that there's a gap between the two pieces, so that when you hit that stick, it makes a big Loud sound. Okay, now the Zen stick is carried by the Zen master and occasionally he hits his student with it. Well, who does he hit and why? Do you know the answer to that? Who does he hit and why?

**Speaker B:** I could, I could guess, but yeah.

**Speaker A:** That's what I'm trying to get you to do. Okay. All right. So it has— I

**Speaker B:** am guessing it has something to do with attention and where attention is directed.

**Speaker A:** Precisely. Precisely. In other words, he does not hit the students who are paying enough attention to know that he's in the room and he hits the one who is lost in space. Later, or a deeper training, or perhaps the deeper training of the ninja, is that there the ninja master walks in with the Zen stick and whacks the ninja students that are still sleeping. He sneaks into the dorm when they're asleep, and whoever's not, uh, having been able to wake up and recognize that the teacher's come into the room Yeah, if they can't get up, they get whacked when they're asleep. Okay, now this is how we do that here at our house. Uh, I'm teaching my daughter martial arts without playing martial arts with her at all, mentioning anything about it. I'm also doing the Zen stick without her knowing anything about it. And that is that when she's, uh, on her— on the bed or on the couch with the cell phone and she's engrossed in that cell phone, I will just simply walk up to her and grab it to wake her up. Now, I have not been able to grab that cell phone from her for a long time. Now all I have to do is show up at the doorway and she smiles. So

**Speaker B:** what is the— I don't know the right word, but what is the end goal of doing that in particular?

**Speaker A:** What is the— Wakey wakey. Yeah, it wakes the child up. That is Sati, to become aware, or in fact what that means, that they're devoting a few mind moments to be here now. Yeah, but they recognize that Daddy's in the room. Okay, before Daddy's in the room and it didn't mean anything to them, it didn't matter, it didn't bother, and so they didn't care and they didn't pay attention to that mind moment. But if they're in danger of having Daddy tickle them or grab their toe or grab their cell phone or play with them, then they begin to join the game. In other words, they begin to wake up, to start watching what's going on, become alert. This is actually Dhamma teaching without having to teach the Dharma at all to a child. You can't just tell the child wake up and expect the child to go wake up himself, but you can surprise him into waking up. The reason I would recognize taking the cell phone away is because that really wakes him up. If that's what he's doing. I mean, when he's engrossed or he's lost. Another way of doing it is take your hand and just put it right in front of his face of whatever he's looking at so that all he can see is your hand, and then he tries to push the hand away. But if you can do that once a day, that's all right, he'll be pushing your hand away before it gets in front of him. That's the teaching of the Dharma. We have to be alert to see things coming.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And get out of their way. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So isn't it also, I guess I'm just trying to think of it like, isn't there also some type of value in being able to focus that deeply into something? That can be used, and, you know, in the right time.

**Speaker A:** And okay, but maybe as a 6-year-old he already knows how to do that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** yeah, yeah. So now maybe he needs another skill also, and that is Sati, to wake up. Yeah, getting stuck in the mud is something that cars already know how to do.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And Western meditation thinks that that's what we're supposed to be doing.

**Speaker B:** Interesting to think about that.

**Speaker A:** Well, actually, it comes from the point of wanting to stop the mind without actually being able to control the mind. And here we're actively practicing controlling the mind. All right, here's where you're going with that. In fact, this is the, uh, a major teaching of the, of the Buddha, is that this is an active practice. It requires skin in the game. And so meditation, uh, practices that are taught in Western Buddhism generally don't have that quality of that you've got to put skin in the game. They actually just say to watch the breath. But in the Anapanasati Sutta, it says mindfully breathe in long. Mindfulness here is not just mere observation, but it is taking the effort to do that. Mindfully breathe in long and mindfully breathe out long while we're also intentionally with effort changing the kind of thoughts that we have into wholesome, gladdening, bright thoughts. And basically, by taking the long, deep breath, that puts us in the direction of being in the senses, to being awake, to be here now, as well as the thoughts that we're redirecting out of the past and the future into right now. The best kind of thoughts that we can have while we're sitting and watching the breath is thoughts about how good it is to breathe, how nice it is to sigh and relax, and how uncomfortable it is just to sit with no place to go and nothing to do, no tensions or anxieties. And so we begin to talk ourselves into feeling really good, and we have to practice this over and over and over again. But it also means that bright and shining because we are on top of this, to remember to keep the thoughts wholesome. Because if we forget, they will go back into the same garbage pit that they've been trained into for the past few years.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so we have to remember over and over and over again to never mind all of that stuff, start again, come back Now, normally what happens for the beginner is, is that as soon as he recognizes that he has— he's no longer meditating, that he has lost his ability to watch the breath, the first thing we do is criticize ourselves. Why? Because that's what we're in the habit of doing, is we make a mistake and then we hate it. Yeah, that we think that we are the mistake. We judge the mistake as bad, and then we busted ourselves for being bad. And then thoughts like, oh, this meditation is hard, oh, this is a monkey mind— that in fact, monkey mind day is normally reserved for day 6 of a 10-day Goenka retreat, where the kids all just recognize that they're insane with this monkey mind. Why? Because they're paying attention enough to it now to recognize, uh, what a mess it is in there. And it's almost like that there is a, uh, that is a monkey mind, because the monkey is being chased by a monster. Somewhere in there, there's a kind of a monster not recognizing that the monster was let in the door and invited in. And that monster is all the lies and all the gossip and all the shoulds and woulds and coulds that we've been told. In other words, it's our set of rules that becomes our monster.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that's why— and so when we recognize, hey, I don't have to monsterize myself, I don't have to order myself around or tell myself stuff to do, I can just relax and play. And then that's when the mind settles down and we can go back and in childhood and really learn to play. But Now we're doing it with alertness and attention because we recognize that our toy box is huge. Yeah, one of the prize items in our toy box is this brand new human toy with a real human brain, and it's really marvelous to play with the thing rather than having it order us around. It used to be the monster, now it can be our best friend. As— but we have to begin to remember and to practice, to rehearse. No excellent musician ever got on stage and wowed his audience without rehearsal. No play is ever pulled off well without rehearsal, especially a dress rehearsal. And so basically what we can say is that our daily practice of sitting meditation is nothing but a dress rehearsal for the performance of living one's life.

**Speaker B:** Interesting. Dress rehearsal.

**Speaker A:** It's a dress rehearsal for the performance of one's life, except that if you keep performing and rehearsing and performing and rehearsing, you get very, very skilled at it. And then you can go about it, uh, go out on stage and have a ball because you know the script so well that you've rehearsed it so well that it becomes natural. And so now the, uh, the audience is really wowed with how much you're enjoying playing the part. Yeah. So that's when it becomes play. Your life becomes play. First is practice, then performance, and then play. Think of those as the 3 Ps:

**Speaker B:** practice, performance, and play. Yeah, that's a good— that's a good way to Remember it.

**Speaker A:** And so basically, what that means is that your whole life becomes music. Your whole life becomes music, and we have to practice music, and then we can perform music, but we begin to perform it so well that now we can just play with it. In fact, that's what the heart of jazz is, is just the musicians are just playing with the music they already performed. Yeah, improvisation and just all over the place. And yet a life we think is a hup, two, three, four. Life is a march. We got to go someplace, we got to get from here to there, we got destinations and goals and all of that kind of stuff. But really, a play or music is really just a dance. It's more like a waltz. Okay, and we can waltz around the dance floor, but we don't have to have the destination of the other side of the room. We just arrived there because we were playing, we were dancing. But the dance is beautiful because it's well practiced and well formed.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so I think that, you know, I haven't like been practicing consistently or for very long, like maybe a year inconsistently, meaning, you know, like a few weeks and then a few weeks nothing. And then, and I don't know, you know, so the reason I'm saying that is because I think you know, with this metaphor of the stage and music and the performance, you have to be able to practice first. That seems like that's, you know, that's the initial barrier, at least. I don't know for everyone, but at least for me, like, because I, you

**Speaker A:** know— That is so funny, because what we're practicing is being happy. We're practicing being joyful and satisfied. The very goal that we spend our lives out huffing and puffing through society, the very goals that we're really after. We think we want that new job, but what really we wanted was to feel good and fit in and do the very high stuff, and we're using the job as a substitute goal. So that's funny that people resist practicing because they resist doing what they're told to do. We got into that habit when we were kids. So now that we're hearing about meditation, we immediately plug that into the should box and out pops the line, you should meditate.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Then we say we don't want to. That's the problem with the word meditation. But Why don't we say instead, why don't we practice playing music?

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** why don't we practice being joyful, being happy, being glad, glad in the mind, feeling good, feeling safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied, and alert, watchful, on top of the game?

**Speaker B:** So this is making me think of something else, this metaphor of games. So for any game or any music, there's the practice, but there's also the— like, if I were to give like an actual example, so like I play chess for fun. For a while. And it's purely just for fun. So it's a short game that I can just play quick games anytime for fun. And so it's not like to some end of like getting better or, you know, but and so, but so there's a certain kind of point that you can develop with just your natural given ability and talent. And you can have fun, but you can only achieve a certain level of awareness within that game. And you might be able to develop or become more aware if you have more knowledge, or more, you're able to become aware of more ideas, and then, you know, you might develop greater awareness of it. But if you're just playing and practicing it without having any kind of external knowledge or information, it feels like it's limited in that there's only so much that you can be aware of within that game. And I don't know if this, you know, how this relates or if this can be related to what we're talking about, but it's just making me think that we need to— there must be some way of having, you know, I guess more, more knowledge to further, to deepen your awareness. And I don't know if that's true

**Speaker A:** or not, but— Oh, absolutely. That's why you're here. In fact, you're using the perspective of chess game. There's quite a lot about that. One is, is that you need a worthy opponent. And it's possible for two kids to teach each other chess in a way that one kid can't learn to play chess by himself.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker A:** That both of them have the same books, they share the books, but when they play, they, they try various things on each other, and they actually learn to play chess by playing with each other. That's possible. And not only is it possible, but it's possibly one of the better ways of learning chess. Another way of learning chess is from a teacher who is going to set you up and let you win, and then set you up again and then let you win again. Yeah, but that becomes contrived. And not only that, but the teacher really doesn't want to do that, because especially if he's really good at chess, because Chess masters do not want to play with beginners because they start to get sloppy. Yeah, because they're letting the students win. And so not having that mindset. So there's a whole lot about the point about chess. Now let's take that and put that into the Dharma situation, that it's unlikely for two people together to teach each other the Dharma because they will wind up arguing with each other. It's almost like that they will not be able to play chess because they'll tear the chessboard up and throw pieces at each other instead. So in that regard, the Dhamma does need a teacher. That this is in fact something that was very, very interesting about what the Buddha taught, and it It also came out in the time of— there's a sutta about when Ananda was out on Vindhabat shortly after the Buddha died, and the Brahmin was asking Ananda, what is the difference between the Buddha and the monks that are left? Okay. Why? What is he higher than them or better than them? You know, what have you lost? That kind of stuff. And Ananda's answer was, is that except for only one thing, we're all the same. That he is at the same level as everyone else. When you're free from suffering, that's all there is to it. And that the one distinction was, is that he found that by himself. That was the unique quality, is that he was able to gain. Now, that's— he also said that has happened before and since. He recognized that he had found an old path, that he'd only discovered a path. He did not invent it. Yeah. And also, we have seen quite good evidence of people from time to time having found that path themselves. But were successful to various degrees of being able to teach it. Yeah. And so there were two things that we got from, from, uh, Sakyamuna, uh, the Buddha, was one, that he discovered the path and he was able to share it with others. Yeah. Because he had old, old friends who were going around with him already. And so they were really primed for it, just like he was. So when he told them the missing ingredients or the missing keys, they were able to pick it up very quickly. And so that's how the Sangha got started. All right, so that goes back then now to the fact that it's been a lineage that has been passed down over and over again for 2,500 years. At first it was wide open and anybody could get it if they wanted to. But that started to make enemies because some people resent it. They don't like the fact that they can't control people. Some people really want to control other people, and those are the kind of people who don't like the fact that if you wake up, you cannot be controlled. You make your own choices. And that pressure, instead of yielding under the pressure, normally we just pop right out of it. And so that's why it is hard to control, is the Buddha is known to just take a hike, just to walk off. So there came a time when these teachings became downright dangerous. Then in fact, over a course of about 200 years between the Brahmins and the Muslims, they wiped out between 80 and 100 million Buddhists. All right. That's how many disappeared because a lot of them went north, a lot of them went east, a lot of them, some went west and they scattered and some just took their robes off but didn't take their mind off.

**Speaker B:** So is that— is that a— how do we— how do we know that number? That's— I mean, I don't— that's a huge number.

**Speaker A:** Oh, well, it's— it's a well-known and estimated number. In fact, some estimated at 80 and others estimated at, uh, 100, and it happened between 1200 and 1400 AD. Wow. As well as the deforestation of India.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Cut down all the monks and all the trees.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so since that time, it has been more surreptitious. It's been kind of hidden. But starting in the 1930s, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa challenged the mentality of keeping it secret anymore and started letting it out in public in Thailand. And so there's a whole set of stories about that that's very interesting. But the point is, is that that's what we're doing here, is that Buddhism is being let out now to the West, the real teachings of the Buddha that has been kept secret within the Sangha, being covered up by what you would call the religion of Buddhism. But the religion of Buddhism is in fact more like an ornate box that is a puzzle box that you have to press the right buttons in the right sequence in order to open the box to get the real prize of the Triple Gem inside. So that's a good way of thinking. And here I am showing you where the buttons are.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it feels like there's a lot to be shown, or maybe there's not a lot, but it's going to take a lot of practice.

**Speaker A:** Yes, but when you're saying that, you're saying that in a way that, yeah, but you're up to it, you can do this.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** that's the beginning of the right attitude as opposed to the loser's attitude of, oh, this is too hard, or you should meditate, but I don't want to. And paying sometimes a lot of money for help by going to a retreat, thinking that if they go to the retreat, that the retreat itself will do them good, rather than you going to the retreat to use it for an opportunity to do nothing and hang out and enjoy your life. Yeah, that you're supposed to go there and do what you're told to do and get what you're supposed to get out of it. It's just another school, up to 3

**Speaker B:** Yeah, seems like there's, yeah, there's, there's so many ways that, yeah, just, just as you're saying, just to be able to just sit and enjoy can be twisted into something else. It's very, very kind of, yeah, very tricky. It seems like it can be.

**Speaker A:** That's exactly right. Yeah, that's exactly right. So, um, if we continue the way that we were and have gotten into the pattern, uh, If we have that kind of pattern, it actually becomes quite predictable. In fact, it becomes so predictable that we have out of ancient society words like destiny, providence, divine guidance, divine plans, that kind of thing. These all come from the mentality that we can see where someone's going, how their life is headed. And that they're completely out of control with that, which means then it must be some higher hand that's guiding that guy down that path in that direction. And that is true, except that that God is not up there in the sky watching him. It's kind of in the back of his head, in the sense that it's the set of rules wrongs, rituals that we have been practicing, rehearsing, and resenting all of these years. And so now we have to begin practicing something that is much more wholesome, something that we haven't practiced before. So this is why we go into practicing this over and over and over again, so that we can come to a state of relaxation. Yeah, lightness. Uh, but it's also sharp. It's not dull. All right, that we, we know when there's sharpness there. We test it from time to time and that sort of thing.

**Speaker B:** But what do you mean by sharpness?

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** What do you mean by that sharpness?

**Speaker A:** Uh, here's, here's an example. Whenever there is lightning that strikes very close by, almost everyone, including the dogs, the chickens, and the people, will jump when that bolt of lightning strikes, followed immediately by the thunder.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And as that thunder cracks all around them, everybody jumps except the old man who is aware that he's in a lightning storm and is looking for it. And when that lightning strikes, he knows that that thunderclap is coming right now, and he just sits there and just is marveling at all these people and dogs jumping up into the air out of fright. Yeah, okay, so that's an example of it, is that most people are not aware of what they're doing. They're ignoring the rain. They don't recognize that they're in a thunderstorm. And then they get surprised when lightning strikes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** But that happens many, many times in the day, all little tiny lightning strikes going off. We live in a thunderstorm. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And And so if I can just relate this to like, just my experience. So living in a, you know, in a family, it's a very, I think it's, you know, as you said, the Dhamma, it means the thing or so I don't remember you were talking about the etymology and things and I had asked about daily things. And so there's so many things In

**Speaker A:** daily lightning strikes, daily things.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And so something that this is making me think of is, you know, each individual in that group or in any group, I'm sure, you know, you have different kind of awarenesses and different areas that you're more aware of, certain types of lightning. I don't know. I don't know if I can carry the metaphor further, but But so if you're, you know, kind of aware of different things, is there a way to like, how can you— it seems like there's a way that you should be able to draw from each other, ideally, to, you know, to help each other be more aware of the different kinds of lightning strikes that are coming. And maybe I like— so specific example, my partner, she is much more aware of— maybe there's— so for example, with my 6-year-old, when he sometimes he just has huge bursts of energy. And that's something that that for some reason it bothers me. And so I will ask him, you know, like, why are you screaming or something like that? Because sometimes he just has a burst of energy. And so that's just one example. And so that's something that bothers— Why

**Speaker A:** don't you play chess with him? Why are you throwing the board up and throwing pieces at him? Why don't you play chess with him?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. So Yeah, exactly. And so she notices this, so she's aware of this. So it's just this. So there's different things that we're aware of. And then, you know, to give a counterexample, maybe it's— Okay, are you aware

**Speaker A:** then that you don't like his burst of energy?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I guess I am aware of that. I must be.

**Speaker A:** But in the moment— If you are aware, then you can practice then changing your feelings. You can turn that from then a burst of, I don't like his energy, into your own burst of energy and go play with him. Go be a pretend monster.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly. So that's a similar thing to what my partner, she will say. And so, yeah, I agree with that. And that's Yeah, definitely. I'm totally with you.

**Speaker A:** Can you remember to do it next time when he's full of energy? Can you remember to play with him even if he's not full of energy? Can you just remember to play with him?

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And you know, like, I do enjoy

**Speaker A:** being a 6-year-old, and you can enjoy being a 6-year-old along with him.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I do. I do that. But there— All right.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Even when there's— Now you're doing it just absent-mindedly and on your own and just as time occurs, now you can do it mindfully. You can do it because you remember that you're going to behave with him differently than you were in the habit of dealing with him, that you can stop giving him your rules and start giving him your joy instead. Yeah, but that takes some practice. You have to practice this.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so yeah, I agree with that, and that's something I will practice. I'll, if we, you know, I'm sure that will happen between now and maybe the next time we see each other, and I will try to remember and bring in.

**Speaker A:** You're going to try, huh? I hear that word every time somebody says it. I pick on it. It's a pet toy. Okay, you're gonna try.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Yeah, definitely pick on it for me.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, we're looking forward to that. I plan on doing that. I can accept when you say I'm going to try doing that. That's setting yourself up for failure.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Okay. I will then.

**Speaker A:** I will. All right. That's the kind of— Yes, because there is power in that will. I will do that. Which is the right attitude. We're working with the development of the right attitude, and the right attitude is that you can have fun playing with your kid.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah, I will. So can I just get back to what I was just going to say? You know, I appreciate it. I appreciate what you said, but I just wanted to say, so like that's something that I need to practice and be mindful of. But then there are other things that my partner, you know, we could talk about as well. And but how can we, you know, I guess I'm just trying to think, you know, is there a way to think about this from, you know, thinking of the Dharma and how to support each other, like how to support her?

**Speaker A:** Absolutely. 100%. The basic teaching of the Buddha is the answer to your question. Let's go through it again. Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, which means see that you have unwholesome thoughts about your family, about yourself, about your son, about your wife. And change those into wholesome thoughts. So when you talk to your wife or girlfriend, you talk to her about how marvelous she is and how you love her so much and how you care for her and how much she helps you and how good this relationship is and that you really appreciate her, and you just rub it in and you start practicing rubbing it in.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, go for the wholesome thoughts. Go for the fact that she's the absolute best thing that ever happened for you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And keep telling her that, and she'll become that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that makes sense. I like that. And, you know, I think that's something that I feel like I know, but it's good to talk and hear somebody else say it. So because I guess, yeah, that's the

**Speaker A:** good thing, because we're— because our— even though our, our gushy, warm feeling, cuddly heart knows that on the deep inside, our society has taught us not to do that. Yeah, that is a jungle out there, where in fact the reality is, is that the one who is screaming jungle, jungle, jungle is in here, and the jungle is in here.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so we feel exposed and in danger when we open in a cuddly way to others. So like an example, when, uh, when Tam goes to the store, she'll say, do you want anything? And I'll say something like, yeah, a kiss. It's awful because that makes her feel warm and bushy. So this is nurturing. Nurture your wife in order to remember to nurture yourself. Nurture your son in order to remember to nurture your wife, in order to remember to nurture yourself. And now you've got a whole triple gem going here of nourishment. And we practice this over and over and over again so that we can nourish the very one who slaps our face. It may take a while. You have to stop stinging first, but you don't have to hold a grudge against him for long. Yeah. So what? Welcome back, Robert. Glad to see you.

**Speaker C:** Good to see you guys. I was gonna make dinner, but I got too lazy.

**Speaker A:** Lazy is good. If Gordon Kengeko can say greed is good, then Dhammarato can say lazy is good.

**Speaker C:** There you go.

**Speaker A:** Lazy is good. No place to go and nothing to do, and everything is okay. Not a problem in the world. World, and that needs to be practiced, right? Especially by those who have things to go, places to be, things to do, hills to conquer, people to hurt, you know, all of that kind of stuff of Western culture. They need to learn lazy, but they are adamant that they're not supposed to be lazy. Even when they go on vacation, they don't vacate, right? They go to a resort, spend a lot of money, work out, go to fine dining, dancing, jogging down the beach. And by the time they get all of that done, when they get back to work, they need a vacation from their vacation.

**Speaker C:** Better enjoy the weekend.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, when they could have just enjoyed the day and hung out. Arahant. Yeah, but we kind of think that, oh, my day off is a special day, I've got to go do something special, when in fact the very special that you can do is nothing. Yeah, just to practice doing nothing and everything is okay. And my family is marvelous. What a marvelous world this little family is. That's the way to think. Yep, got everything you need. All is well. But you see, that's not the way that we normally think. We normally think about the way that we were taught to think. But now you're having the opportunity to make a change, but not a change, but the possibility of practicing making changes, because that's the only way that we'll ever learn anything, is by making a mistake, look at what we're doing, picking ourselves up, dusting ourselves off, and then boogie down the road. And it's learning how to remember to pick ourselves up and dust ourselves off, but we'd rather lay in the road in a pity party. Or me. Somebody tripped me up. Who was it? Whodunit? So this is what the practice is really all about. The practice is about having fun, because we've actually forgotten how to have fun. And we think that the only fun that we can have is by playing sports, beating somebody at basketball, or weightlifting or getting something done, and then we can have joy, rather than the fact that we can have joy by, uh, the very, very best skill is to be able to set things down.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And to stop trying to get our joy out of things and places and people and start taking our joy, which was freely available to us all along. We just got talked out of Joe, Yusuf, what do you think about this?

**Speaker B:** I think tomorrow is kind of like a vacation. So I'm going to— it's the weekend. So I think it's a good time to practice what we've been talking about. And not do anything, just be with my family and practice these things.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and practice being wholesome. That's the only thing you've got to do, is to practice doing nothing. You don't have anything to fix. Your wife's not broken, your kid's not broken. He's wonderful, he's just fine just like he is.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I know that. So Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So go enjoy playing with him.

**Speaker B:** I will.

**Speaker A:** I will.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's, that's good. I think that this is a good lesson for you today, is to recognize that, um, that we do not have to treat the teachings of the Buddha as something special. There's really nothing to it. That's, that's a Buddhist joke, by the way, I just told. There's really nothing to it because there's this highfalutin word called Sunyata, or Sunyata, that means the void or emptiness. And Westerners just don't understand that that's just a toy to play with, that there's nothing to it. What's the meaning of life? Well, There's nothing to it. Yeah, nothing much there. Which means that we do not have to fulfill a destiny, that in fact it's because we are in old bad habits we're actually fulfilling our destiny, because our destiny is just our old bad habits. We're going around doing what we were told to do. We're being, let us say, guided by an invisible hand. Yeah. And so all we need then to do is to take control of one's life, recognize you can feel the way that you want to feel, you can do what you want to do, which is probably a whole lot of nothing. Just enjoy the show. You don't have to be an actor on the stage. You don't have to be a daddy. You can just be a friend. You don't have to be a husband. You can just be a lover.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that's That's— I agree with that. That's what— that— because, because if you're, if you're trying to fulfill something, it might not create the result that I want.

**Speaker A:** Then in fact, why want a result? That's the whole problem, is that our society has taught us to be in a state of want.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** rather than being in the state of satisfied. So that's what we're practicing. It's practice of just being satisfied. Take the day off. Today's a good day already. Nothing to it. Easy peasy.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Um, every time the old machine starts up again, start watching that That's the whole point, is watch what you're doing, because the mind is in the habit of cranking out a bunch of garbage, a bunch of orders, a bunch of shoulds, a bunch of instructions, and we wind up feeling bad about what we're telling ourselves to do.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, there's a lot of watching to do, I feel like, at least for me, because it seems like there's more and more. I mean, that you kind of notice.

**Speaker A:** So,

**Speaker B:** so I've got the work, the work is cut out. So that's kind of exciting, I guess, rather than not— I mean, just rather than not, not seeing that there's all that work to do. I guess that's, that's how I'm feeling right now. So, and I think maybe if you're— and I'm sure that, you know, like you don't know what you don't know, but you can— I feel like you can get an idea or an intimation of what you have to do.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, there's another kind of small way of looking at it. You're correct in what you're saying, but another way of phrasing it or another way of looking at it is that We don't need to know everything. We only need to know enough. And all we really need to know is that it's okay, that my life passes my test and I'm all right. Okay, that I have arrived. I'm okay. I've made it this far. So far so good. That's the important piece of information to have, if you're okay.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay, you're not broken and need to be fixed. Yeah, I mean, what a relief that is. Think about it. Did you—

**Speaker B:** so what about someone else who doesn't feel that way? I mean, there's people who struggle.

**Speaker A:** Well, you're not going to be able to help them if you start feeling their way when they do. Yeah, the only way that you're going to be able to help them is by being able to remain okay even when they tell you you're not. Yeah. Or that they're not. Oh, that's why it needs to— yeah, go ahead, Robert. I've been waiting for you.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I've just been thinking about something that's been happening the last several hours. So, um, one question is, what if, you know, the other person wants something very unreasonable you know, and it's hard for you to give them that thing because of how unreasonable it is, you know. And you can do it, but like, it takes a lot of time, you know, etc. But you want to maintain the relationship with this person.

**Speaker A:** Sure. But you're using the word unreasonable. Let's unpack that for just a moment. Okay. Sure. Unreasonable actually has the quality of it is fanciful. Okay, that we cannot reason our way into it means that it's fanciful. All right, so one of the ways that we can do that then is start making it fancy. Start talking about what color it's going to be and how big it is and just really get it big and start to play with it. Okay, and as you do and talk the person into it that way One of the ways that you can then begin to do is with the questions and the techniques. You begin to ask some questions to where they too can see that they're playing with a fantasy, that it's unreasonable. But you do it in a very playful, haphazard kind of way. Nowhere to go. But if you think of them as unreasonable because their request is unreasonable, Now you've gone down your own rabbit hole. I mean, how many times have you wanted something unreasonable?

**Speaker B:** A lot.

**Speaker A:** That's the point. We all go around wanting things, and it doesn't matter whether they're reasonable or not. The issue is wanting. Right. Greed, according to Gekko, is good, but look what happens to people who catch that disease.

**Speaker C:** Sure, doesn't go so well.

**Speaker A:** But when we recognize that, hey, I don't want anything because I've got what I need, I'm okay already, I I've got it all. Everything's okay, everything's fine. And that becomes not only realization, but almost kind of like a mantra to practice. But that's wholesome. I'm already okay. I don't need unreasonable things. That in fact, a way of looking at it is any and everything that you wanted that was reasonable has already been within your reach and you've gotten it. The only things that we don't have are the things that were unreasonable already in the beginning. Everything that you want that you don't have is something unreasonable for you to be wanting right now. Get over it. You don't have it. It's not here. And not only get over it, but get over it and then say, wow, I don't even have to go have to get it anymore. But that was unreasonable. Okay, so that's the way to begin to understand unreasonable. Yeah, everything is unreasonable. Fixing the Democratic Party is unreasonable thing to want. Fixing the Republican Party is unreasonable also. So let's stop wanting unreasonable things and start enjoying the way things really are as they already are. They're good enough. Let the unreasonable people fight with each other over who gets what, because all of them are going to remain unsatisfied and unreasonable no matter how much they batter each other. So that's how you deal with someone who is unreasonable, is treat it in a humorous way. Oh, is that what you want, huh? Yeah. And you can question them about it in the sense of, um, well, will that car fit in your driveway? I mean, just silly little questions. You can just ask her all kinds of questions and get them to begin to see their reasoning is such that they can't, they don't have it, and they're probably not going to get it because what they want is unreasonable.

**Speaker B:** So why is play and humor effective in this? Why? I'm just curious if there's a way to understand why that is a response.

**Speaker A:** Because your only choice is either battle, fight or flight. Okay, those are the only other two choices, is fight or flight or friendship. Those are your three choices: fight or flight or friendship.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I think that, um, that's That's enough for me to remember for today. Fight or flight, our friendship, and practice, performance, and play.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. So awesome.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I have to sign off, but

**Speaker A:** I know this has been a really great time, guys. I really appreciate that. Hang on, Robert, we'll finish the video and we'll chat about something else. So, okay, Yusuf, I am so glad to see you. Thank you. This has been really great. I've enjoyed it.

**Speaker B:** Me too. Bye. All right, take care. Bye, Robert.

**Speaker C:** I'll call you right back. Great to see you, Youssef.

**Speaker A:** Have a great Friday evening. All right, cheers.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends (Speakers B and C), focuses on **re-framing meditation and daily life as a playful, skillful practice of cultivating joy and awareness, rather than a rigid, goal-oriented discipline.**

Here are the core themes and insights:

### **1. Dhamma as "Day-to-Day Things"**
- The word **Dhamma** originally meant "thing" in Pali. Thus, "day-to-day things" are "day-to-day Dhamma"—the Buddha's teachings applied to ordinary life.
- Meditation shouldn’t be seen as a special "retreat" activity but as **skill development through continuous practice** in daily moments.

### **2. Rehearsing Happiness vs. Rehearsing Unhappiness**
- We have spent a lifetime rehearsing unhappiness by telling ourselves stories of dissatisfaction.
- The core practice is to **consciously and repeatedly "talk ourselves into feeling good"**—cultivating wholesome, gladdening thoughts.
- This is different from "positive thinking" or aspiration, which can still be rooted in wanting what we don’t have, leading to dissatisfaction.

### **3. Meditation as Active Practice, Not Passive Observation**
- Western meditation often emphasizes passively "watching the breath," but true practice (based on the Anapanasati Sutta) is **active and intentional**: mindfully breathing long, directing thoughts toward joy, relaxation, and contentment.
- It requires **"skin in the game"**—effort to redirect thoughts from habitual negativity to wholesome ones.

### **4. The "Three P's": Practice, Performance, Play**
- **Practice**: The daily "dress rehearsal" of sitting meditation, where we rehearse feeling satisfied and aware.
- **Performance**: Bringing that rehearsed skill into daily life.
- **Play**: When practice becomes so natural that life becomes a joyful, improvisational dance—like jazz musicians playing with music.

### **5. Waking Up with "Sati" (Mindfulness)**
- Using the metaphor of the **Zen stick**, mindfulness is about waking up to the present moment, not losing oneself in distraction.
- This can be cultivated playfully (e.g., playfully interrupting a child engrossed in a phone to bring their attention to the present).
- The goal isn’t to eliminate deep focus but to **balance it with alert awareness** of our surroundings.

### **6. Breaking Free from Societal Conditioning**
- We are often conditioned by society to live by "shoulds," rules, and external expectations, leading to resentment and guilt.
- The path involves **recognizing these patterns** and choosing to feel and think in ways that bring genuine satisfaction, not following an internalized "monster" of rules.

### **7. Applying Dhamma in Relationships**
- In family life, replace unwholesome reactions (e.g., annoyance at a child's energy) with **playful engagement** (e.g., joining their energy as a game).
- Nurture relationships by **repeatedly expressing appreciation and love**, which reinforces wholesome feelings for both giver and receiver.
- In conflicts, respond with **playfulness and humor** rather than fight-or-flight. This creates connection ("friendship") instead of strife.

### **8. The Attitude of "Enough"**
- The practice is ultimately about **cultivating satisfaction with "what is."**
- We don’t need to "fix" ourselves or others; we are already "okay." The relief comes from letting go of the need to achieve or acquire more.
- **"Sunyata" (emptiness)** is playfully interpreted as "there’s nothing to it"—no grand destiny to fulfill, just freedom from habitual patterns.

### **Key Takeaways for Daily Practice:**
- **Practice feeling good now**, not as a future goal.
- **Actively redirect thoughts** to wholesome, joyful ones.
- **Approach life as play**, not a march toward destinations.
- **Nurture yourself and others** with gratitude and affection.
- **When faced with "unreasonable" demands**, respond with playful curiosity rather than resistance.

The talk emphasizes that the Dhamma is not an esoteric philosophy but a practical, playful guide to living a joyful, aware life, free from self-imposed suffering.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by the speakers, primarily by Speaker A (the teacher, Dhammarato):

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Dhamma as "The Thing":** The Pali word "Dhamma" is explained as meaning "thing." So "day-to-day things" becomes "day-to-day Dhamma," and "Buddha Dhamma" is "the Buddha's thing." This demystifies the concept and grounds it in everyday life.

2.  **Meditation as Skill Development / Rehearsal:** Meditation is compared to practicing a skill (like music or acting) "over and over and over again." It's not a special state but a rehearsal of new mental habits.
    *   **Sub-metaphor: Dress Rehearsal:** Daily sitting meditation is a "dress rehearsal for the performance of living one's life."

3.  **The 3 Ps: Practice, Performance, Play:** Life is framed as a progression:
    *   **Practice:** The repetitive rehearsal of wholesome thoughts.
    *   **Performance:** Applying that skill in daily life.
    *   **Play:** When skill becomes so natural that life becomes joyful improvisation, like jazz music.

4.  **Life as Music/Dance vs. a March:** The unskillful approach to life is like a rigid **march** (focused on destinations and goals). The skillful approach is like a **waltz, dance, or music**—focused on the joyful process itself without a fixed endpoint.

5.  **The Mind as a Toy/Monster/Best Friend:** Our mind, which has been conditioned by society, is initially like a **monster** that orders us around and criticizes us. Through practice, we can transform it into our **best friend** and a marvelous **toy** to play with.

6.  **Society's Teachings as Malicious Gossip and Lies:** Our conditioned self is described as "the sum total of all the malicious gossip and lies that I have been told my whole life." This metaphor highlights the external, negative origin of our habitual self-criticism.

7.  **Buddhism as a Puzzle Box:** Institutional or religious Buddhism is compared to an **ornate puzzle box**. You need to press the right buttons in sequence to open it and find the real prize (the Triple Gem) inside. The teacher's role is to show where the buttons are.

8.  **Unwholesome Thoughts as a Garbage Pit:** If we forget to guide our thoughts, they automatically revert to the "same garbage pit they've been trained into."

9.  **Daily Irritations as Lightning Strikes:** Minor daily upsets and surprises are like **little lightning strikes** in a constant thunderstorm. The unaware person is always jumping (reacting). The aware person sees the storm (the nature of life) and isn't startled.

10. **"Skin in the Game":** True practice requires active effort and personal investment ("skin in the game"), not passive observation.

11. **"There's nothing to it":** A playful nod to the Buddhist concept of *Sunyata* (emptiness), meaning there's no heavy destiny to fulfill or ultimate problem to solve.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Zen Stick (Kyosaku):** Speaker A tells the story of the Zen master's stick used to hit inattentive students. He extends it to the **ninja master** hitting sleeping students, and then to his own modern version: **playfully taking his daughter's cell phone** or putting his hand in her line of sight to teach her alertness (*Sati*) in daily life.

2.  **Teaching Chess:** Used to discuss learning Dhamma. Two children can teach each other chess by playing, but this often fails with Dhamma because people "argue" or "throw the chessboard." This illustrates the need for a skilled teacher in this domain.

3.  **Ananda and the Brahmin:** After the Buddha's death, the monk Ananda is asked what made the Buddha unique. The story concludes that the Buddha's distinction was that **he found the path by himself**. This story highlights the Buddha as a discoverer and teacher, not a god.

4.  **The Historical Persecution of Buddhists:** Speaker A references the historical claim that between 80-100 million Buddhists were wiped out or displaced between 1200-1400 AD by Brahmins and Muslims, leading to teachings being kept secret. This story sets up the narrative of the "real" Dhamma being hidden within a "religion."

5.  **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa:** Briefly mentioned as the Thai monk who, starting in the 1930s, challenged the secrecy and began teaching the Dhamma openly to the public.

6.  **Personal Anecdote - Asking for a Kiss:** Speaker A shares that when his partner asks if he wants anything from the store, he says, "a kiss." This is a simple, practical example of "nurturing" a relationship and creating wholesome, affectionate moments.

7.  **The Failed Vacation:** The story of people who go on expensive, activity-packed vacations only to need another vacation to recover. This contrasts with the Dhamma ideal of learning to "do nothing" and be satisfied anywhere.

### **Core Function of the Metaphors and Stories:**
They serve to **demystify Buddhist practice**, frame it as an **active, skill-based endeavor** relevant to daily life (parenting, relationships, work), and contrast it with **passive, goal-oriented, or religious approaches** the speaker associates with "Western meditation mentality." The metaphors are often drawn from arts (music, theater), sports, games, and everyday family interactions to make the teachings accessible and practical.
