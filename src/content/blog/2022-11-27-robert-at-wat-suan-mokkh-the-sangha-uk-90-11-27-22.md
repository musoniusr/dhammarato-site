### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Hello Robert, my would it change? I really like your shave and also the color of your hair. It looks like that you've been to a salon and it's got the blue tab on the back. That's an interesting thing. I bet it's designed to be worn in a ponytail or something.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it looks good in a bun or a ponytail because it's like a little blue bun. Yeah. But yeah, thanks.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Well, right now you're at Wat Soan Mok, and that's really great. Can you put your camera around to let us see what you're looking at from the position that you're at now? I can see over your left shoulder. There we go. Okay, I know where that is. They paved that road. That road was not paved before.

**Speaker B:** Old home. Yes, just coming to the front entrance here.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. Oh, that's not— that's one of the side entrances. The front entrance has got gates on it and it's got shops around and big fences and all of that kind of stuff. But this is in the— in the Wat area. That's really great. So Robert, you said that you had a— oh yeah, show us the, um, uh, that stonework that was there. Not the one— turn, turn around and go back where you were. 5 steps ahead. That's— is that in Thai? I can't see it quite yet.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it's written in Thai.

**Speaker A:** Okay. All right. Those are some of the old, old things that they have just planted around. Watch, you can see the age of that thing. That thing may be 50 years old. It's almost like a tombstone. And it's just got a little Dhamma writing on it. And you'll find those all over. Watch the windmills. Some of them are in wheels and have the Dhamma in a picture form. So that's common here for the Watts in Thailand, is to have Dhamma just on posters all over the place. So Robert, you have a question?

**Speaker B:** Yes, my question is how to— if it's possible to use the skills we're learning with regards to self-talk. Specifically removing unwholesome thoughts and planting wholesome thoughts to motivate ourselves. And if— just curious if anyone in this call has done that yet and experimented with that. More than anything, just curiosity.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, I'll tell you what, you could actually say that Anapanasati is the most effective motivator there is, that it really does get you moving. In fact, that's what the— let us say, an easy explanation of the full Sotapanna is the one who is completely motivated by the dollar with the Dhamma.

**Speaker B:** The Dharma, yes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, he's just motivated for the Dhamma because he knows that that's such a winning thing to be motivated for. That no matter what people do in whatever profession, every one of them would benefit greatly from the Dharma, even to the point of leaving that profession and going find something better to do. And we keep looking until we eventually find out that the best thing that we could possibly do is sit down and do nothing. Yes, we're going to do that either dead or alive. The question is, are we going to do it dead or are we going to do it alive? Because that's what we want to do is not so much motivating to do things, but motivated to be here, to be alive.

**Speaker B:** All right, guys, I'm going to grab some breakfast now. But I'll come back online in like 5 minutes.

**Speaker A:** Okay. All right.

**Speaker B:** Thanks, guys.

**Speaker A:** All right. Well, I was just getting into your question. So we can go over to Jeff's question now. So, Jeff. Well, that's actually pretty funny because my next call to you was about keeping the motivation going. So, my question is the same as Robert's. Yes. In fact, that when we do actually in the Dharma get on a roll, We think, "Hot dog, I got it!" And then we kind of skate, we don't do so much meditation anymore, we kind of let it fallow. And then something happens, some Dukkha comes by, we get busted our chops, we have a new opportunity, something happens, and then we get all deeply involved again. That happens with everybody. And not only that, but it is often quite productive in the process. And I've got two examples of that. The first example that I'll give is the example from— it's a recently done thing, it was just announced. The PhD program is out and this guy got his PhD, from someplace in the United States, but he's 100% Indian. And what he was working out was the actual rules of grammar that applied to Sanskrit, because they finally found out the code and got— did you see that article, Spurgeon? Okay, so, uh, yeah, I saw it.

**Speaker B:** Posted on the, on Skype.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, uh, This whole point then is wrapped around the fact that we have for 2,500 years or so been trying to solve this riddle that's been there, that's a linguistic problem, and it actually makes it impossible to computerize it, because we haven't figured out how the whole puzzle of linguistics fit together. And this guy finally figured it out, but this is what happened, was he got discouraged with it. And so he took the summer off and he went and he skied and he volleyed and he played and go swimming and do all kinds of stuff and get away from that project. And when he came back to the project, he didn't really want to, but he started reviewing and getting into the project. And then he said it clicked and everything fell into place. Did you read that part of it, Sturgeon?

**Speaker B:** No, I didn't read too much of it.

**Speaker A:** I just kind of— okay, well, the best part was buried down at the bottom of it.

**Speaker C:** Oh, okay.

**Speaker A:** How he figured it out. Okay, that same thing now has happened to Einstein, and there is in fact, it's actually part of the process within certain elements of Zen, most specifically within Zen and line drawing art, calligraphy, etc., like that. Okay, that in fact, we were just talking to Robert, who has quite a lot of that Zen Anagami-style art at Wat Suan Mook, the Spiritual Theater. When he comes back on, we'll bring that back up. So, in that tradition, the first thing that the students learn to do is how to mix and make the ink. Then they learn to use the bamboo, to shave the bamboo so that they can get various kinds of strokes. And they also make all of the tools for the top-quality students who are already beyond that stage. So, the first and second graders are helping the fourth and fifth graders, kind of, by making their tools for them. I think every oboist would really love for somebody to tailor-make a reed for him because he's got to do that. I mean, that's half of oboe playing is getting your reed right. Okay, so that's the first stage. Then the second stage is actually getting in there and playing with it, and we do that for a while. And then the third stage is leaving it. Forgetting about it, and in the tradition that I've heard, that's 10 years. So you may do art for 10 years after you've done brushes for 5 years, and then you do nothing for 10 years, and when you come back, it all falls into place and you're a master within hours. You could have spent that 10 years doing the line drawing and then didn't, and that's also quite true of the Dhamma. That it needs to be come back to and come back to and come back to, because it's quite natural once we got it going, we're going to relax to the point of not doing that observation anymore. But in fact, that's part of the reason why I really enjoy these videos with you guys, is because it keeps me focused on the Dhamma. Because I've been out, I've taken a hike or two, I bit off more than I could chew. And so, oh, Robert, I want to repeat something for you. We were just talking about Zen and the art of calligraphy or line drawings, and that I wanted to mention with you that much of the stuff that's there All your food. Aha.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it's pretty cool.

**Speaker A:** That's breakfast. All right. So that Emanuel Sherman was the artist that did most of that Japanese artwork, but he was already an art designer and artist in the Western tradition. And then he went to Japan and studied this calligraphy that they have, the Japanese. And then he retired. And then after a while, he came back and did all of that stuff that's at Wat Soan Moh. He actually had those sarcophagus for him, and the stupa is right here at Wat Khao Tom, only 2 kilometers from here. And so there was a lot of it there also. But over the years, it's just kind of disappeared to where the stuff at Wat Suwan Mokkh is kind of built into the wall, so it's hard to make it disappear. Uh, so anyway, that whole idea then, Jeff, is to getting away from it is an okay thing to do, because when we get ready to come back, we'll have that whole base of foundation. It's very similar with that. I remember also in the sense of playing the piano that I got away from it for years. Didn't do it since high school or more. And then 10 years later, in the '70s, uh, in, in Ann Arbor, I came across the opportunity. And yeah, I could— didn't have it the first hour, but after a while, pick it back up again. And so that whole idea of taking a break is not necessarily a bad thing to do, but in fact it does have benefits. So those are the two examples, and we can go on with that. But the thing of it is, is that the Dhamma always is staying in the back of the mind. It's always there. And so the question is, are you going to put just a little bit of effort. That's the whole point. The example that I use is, is that when a child wants to swing and swing at the park, the adult comes behind and pushes, getting that kid off, especially if it's a fat kid like me. It's hard to get that thing. That's work to push that kid off to get him swinging back and forth. And that's the same thing with the Dharma. And it's the same thing if you've ever done that with a car to get it pushed off. Is hard work. On a flat plane, pushing it takes work, but once you get it rolling, if you keep pushing and keep pushing and keep pushing, then the car just rolls. Or with the swing, the guy keeps pushing and then it returns, and then he pushes again, and then it goes out, and then it comes back and returns, and you keep pushing. But if you stop pushing Over a period of time, it will come to a stop. That's that stop that we're talking about. And so that means that when you come back to the Dharma, just like coming back to the piano, it's hard to get started again. You gotta push. So the question then comes, are you going to just let it go and then come back and put the effort to push it again? Or are you going to just once in a while push it just to keep it moving? It's your choice.

**Speaker B:** Student of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. Sorry, I don't speak Thai. Sorry.

**Speaker A:** Put Thai, my die. Robert, a new phrase for you: put Thai, my die. Say it.

**Speaker B:** Put Thai, my die.

**Speaker A:** Right. Put Thai.

**Speaker B:** This means I didn't speak Thai.

**Speaker A:** Put means speak. Thai, my means no. Die is the word for do. Put time, I die.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay.

**Speaker A:** Thai language not speak, or Thai language not do.

**Speaker B:** Cool, that sounds really handy for me actually, because that's what I'm about to say a number of times so far.

**Speaker A:** All right, so, uh, getting back to the, to the point is, is that we now have two options that will work in all circumstances. That in fact, in certain circumstances, we don't really need to do that much pushing ever anyway. And what I'm talking about now is conformity to a group. Any drunk— excuse me, any person who spends a lot of time in a bar, sitting at the bar, talking with the barflies, he's going to become a lounge lizard or barfly himself. If you spend all your time doing that, it depends upon who you associate with. And so in one example, the artist, the Zen artist that was taking a break, Does he live in that Zendo where he learned that art, or is he out laying bricks? Because there's a difference. And so, one of the things then that we can see is the possibility that one can be around nobles, one can in fact be living with Zen calligraphy artist and not do the trade and to know it well. It's common in Thailand, I've seen it, I didn't understand it for many years until I've actually watched the process of some of these guys go through it, is that a monk does not need a hat to meditate, that meditation when done properly really speeds the process up. But another thing that will really speed the process up is by being associated with nobles, and being around noble people, who give you noble answers to ordinary questions. And not only that, but not only are you around there, you're not ignorant of where you are. You know where you are, which influences the way you think. The place that you are, the place that gives you so much data input all day long, highly influences what we've got on our mind. Monkey see, monkey do, you've heard that. This is what I'm talking about. That's a very simple way to say it, but it's inbuilt, part of the nesting instinct, part of the survival instinct. We survive by being able to fit into our environment, not sticking out like the proverbial sore thumb. By living that way in a noble environment with noble people, you begin to have noble thoughts and you never sit down to meditate to have those noble thoughts. The real reason why people need to do this, because one, if they've got no noble people around them to give them a noble kick in the butt, then you have to go get that thing started yourself. But if you're around people, they'll help you do that pushing off. That we've got to do with right noble effort.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I was talking to Scott. I was talking to Scott yesterday and I asked him, what should I do while I'm at the Wat? Like, what should I do for my meditation and stuff? And he said, just be at Swan Mokkh and chill out. Just, just be at the Wat and chill out. And that was it. And I was— I thought that was really eloquently put.

**Speaker A:** And that sounds like what I've been talking about, doesn't it? Uh-huh. Good for— good for Scott. Thumbs up.

**Speaker B:** Okay, you soak up the atmosphere. Everyone has such an equanimous and loving-kindness attitude towards you, so you soak it up, you reciprocate it quite naturally.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. And I have seen Westerners go and install and at Wat Suwan Mokkh and work really hard at their meditation.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm. Yes. It's almost like they become gardeners in the sense that somebody can just walk in and enjoy the garden. Even the gardener could sit in the garden, enjoy the garden. But many gardeners are not garden enjoyers. They're garden doers, and they're all just clipping and doing and breaking their leaves and all that kind of stuff. And they don't even recognize the paradise they're in. Because they're too busy trying to— It's a whole great big struggle.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's a whole great big struggle.

**Speaker A:** But there you are.

**Speaker B:** And resonate with that part of, um, how you teach the Dhamma about just chilling out and enjoying it, because it's tough for me to motivate myself to do meditation when it feels like work. So if it feels good, it's, it's kind of self-motivating a little bit. Makes it okay, more convenient.

**Speaker A:** You can be just— you can be just on a walk. Let's just call it a walk, ambling around, roaming around, exploring. All of those kind of words kind of fit for what we're talking about, just in Wat Suwan Mokkh. And you may have a little bit of tiredness, and so you find some stoop or something that people have sat on over the years and sit down and just enjoy nature. And all of a sudden you're in first jhana. Just wham, wow, this is so nice, and you didn't have to work hard to do it. That in fact, working hard prevents us from being able to get into that relaxed, peaceful, absolutely satisfied, glorious state of my, this is wonderful. Now, a lot of different philosophers and teachers have tried to teach this, but the language doesn't work. You can say this in various ways and in various languages, okay? One of the ways that you hear— I mean, Christianity is full of it, like God loves you. Have you heard that 20,000 times? That's what is true if you really understand what is being said there at the deepest, most profound level. That's what it is to sit there at Wat Soan Mokkh and say, wow, Wat Soan Mokkh loves me. I feel at home here. This is a wonderful place to be. And that gives you that feeling of being at home, because most of us feel like that we're wanderers or travelers through life. And so go doing that wandering and traveling through what someone may actually lead you to sit down and enjoy the place instead.

**Speaker B:** That's a really good point. Thank you for saying that.

**Speaker A:** So this is the motivation now that we gain through the meditation of the— in fact, the motivation is, wow, how good this really is, how profound this teaching actually is. That now becomes our motivation. And so that means that generally we start looking for things that we are going to do because we're doing kind of species. Human beings are the most doing of all the animals, and there's quite a lot of animals that do a lot of doing. I've seen crows and other birds. They do a whole lot of stuff. They steal. In fact, I mentioned your jacket that you got lost. I mean, a squirrel or raccoon or something like that could have crawled in there and say, hey, this is leather, and it's not, it's Paticcasamuppada. But he can't tell the difference, and off out into the woods it goes. In fact, in your exploring, you may run across that jacket. Yes, it'll be in tatters. It may be hard to recognize. Yeah, but we don't know.

**Speaker B:** It's already a little in tatters, so it's not the worst thing in the world to have lost. Not that it would be anyway, because we can let it go.

**Speaker A:** That's one of the things that's most appealing about Wat Soan Mook, though, is that it's a wild place. It really is literally a forest. There is very little, even though the word 'suan' actually means what I live in here is a 'suan,' which is like both a garden or a cultivated farm put in nature. But that only exists at Wat Suwan Mokkhit, the front of the Wat. The deeper into the Wat you go, the more natural it becomes. I mean, overgrowth everywhere. But even in front of the wat, they leave it as natural as they can. In fact, before the call started, I found it kind of curious that there at Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's kuti, they've actually painted the walls. When I was there, no paint. But getting back to that point about your environment has so much profound impact upon us, And sometimes the environment is so heavy that it outweighs whatever meditation that we're practicing. I mean, if you're a member of a gang and you live with the gang and they're using all kinds of language about violence and hating people and getting even and getting money and all of that kind of stuff, and that's all everybody talks about, then it's hard to put our minds back in good space. But if you're in the space where people people around you or ahead of you, and all they see is your violence.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it makes you more conscious of.

**Speaker A:** It then, because they can see it. And it's like you learn to become on guard, but it's not like we do as a child out of fear, but we do it out of respect in the sense that, hey, I can live up to these standards. I'm as good a human being as I can be. And I can live this way. I can in fact learn to fit into a very harmonious group of humans and be well-loved and well-accepted and fit in. Wow, what a relief that is, because everybody feels like wherever they are, they don't quite belong there. Puja, do you know what I'm talking about?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I have a bit of a feeling, but yeah, yeah, for sure. Having the environment can really be a great benefit just to the practice and make it a lot easier if you're in a wholesome environment. So I think that's the thing, right? If you're not in such a conducive environment, it's like, okay, might want to have those seclusion sessions a little bit more, but it's not so much necessary if you're like at a place like Wat Soan Mook, because you can just be there, right?

**Speaker A:** So you could just sit down and chill wherever you are because everybody's sitting down with you is already chilling anyway.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's true, man. It's super true. I was— they took me to see some temple shrine yesterday in a car with, I think, 2 monks and 2 nuns, and we went up to where they keep the bones of the deceased, and then we did a meditation just sitting on the mountain looking out, where we meditated on sending Samadhi to dead people so that they would be at peace. And it was really interesting because they were all super peaceful people, But then me, because I'm a bit more socially anxious and stuff, and just awkward because I don't know the language and stuff, I was like a bit like high energy, like quite like agitated and anxious when I'm talking to them. But eventually that started to calm down, and I was like, oh, this is how they've all been feeling this whole time, is this sort of this peace and this ease. And we're not worrying that someone's like you know, we're not like hypervigilant against like imaginary like fears and stuff and the other person and stuff, right?

**Speaker A:** So instead of you got to do it exactly the way they do it, so you got to be on your toes and you got to be afraid, danger about screwing up is around the corner everywhere we look, is the Western way of doing it. But what you're beginning to see is, is hey, just relax and chill and look at what's going on. Just watch. You don't have to be that hypervigilant. It's not— when I use the word guard, I'm talking about the kind of guard that would be at a hospital, not a prison. Or military guard.

**Speaker B:** Another thing I noticed is it's sort of like I have like a habit of using anxiety to stay awake. I noticed when I start to get peaceful in my meditations, I start to fall asleep. But if I can stay awake while being peaceful, it's really happy and it's conducive to concentration and Jhana and stuff. But it's sort of like I've developed this habit of like using anxiety just to, just to stay awake and to do basic things in life rather than being able to do that with just awakeness and peacefulness and happiness and stuff.

**Speaker A:** Okay, you do also understand that anxiety, anxiousness, and restless energy actually drains us of our energy because we're expending it, we're burning it up. It's almost like we keep the lights on and that drains our battery. And so when you do get peaceful and quiet, then you fall asleep, recognize that as a sign rather than running those rules back up the Plactalk. You're supposed to be awake. So if you happen to fall asleep wherever you are, just let yourself do that. It's okay, unless you've got an appointment. I mean, you might miss a bus at the bus station, so you need to do something at that point. But at Wat Soan Mokkh, you're not at the bus station, so don't put pressure on yourself to stay awake, because when you allow yourself the sleep that you need, as well as coming out of all of the excess energy that you're no longer spending, then wakefulness becomes part of the package of the growth of mindfulness. It's the Sati, it's the waking up anyway. And so it's almost better to fall asleep and then wake up, is better than to force yourself to stay awake. In fact, you've seen people who do that, on some sort of marathon. They've done it on radio stations over the years and things like that. And sometimes computer scientists and Elon Musk kind of people do it too. We just get into it and we won't get out of it until about 36 hours later when we can't even find the pencil that's right there in front of the desk. And then we say, okay, it's time to sleep. Wow. We just lose the mind when we're not getting enough sleep, working too hard. We lose it. And so there's only one thing to do, and that is to go to sleep. And if we don't, there's guys that have actually set records of 72 hours, and they generally went into the hospital and didn't recover for a while. And so spending time with the idea, I've got to stay awake because I read something or some monk said something. Don't pressurize yourself that way. If you go to sleep while you're in meditation, congratulate yourself for having been relaxed enough that you just let it go, okay? Because when you're tired, you need to sleep. I highly recommend all the guys who are in a normal lifestyle to get plenty of sleep. Allow yourself to have sleep, to take naps. In fact, that's common within the Sangha, you don't see the monks in the afternoon because they're in their kuti. Some of them, a lot of them are taking their nap, others are working really hard at meditation. And so that gives them the ability to have short naps throughout the day. That's been talked about over the years, and it's really part of the natural process. I don't know when and how it got, but it probably had to do when things like employment got started. During feudal times, they only came and took the taxes once a year when the harvest came in. Government came with the troops and Prince John or whoever like that and just took everything. Okay, but somewhere along the way we got into the idea you got to work in the day and sleep at night. Primitive people don't live like that, but we now— part of our culture has required that, and it's just taken over almost all places in the world. Most of the places in the world have that idea that you're up in the day and sleep at night, and then you have all kinds of problems. Problems with people who then reverse that by taking what's called the graveyard shift, and there's a good reason for talking about it in the sense of graveyard shift, because it puts people in the grave to work all night and sleep all day. I did that when I was working at a hospital once, and it kind of drains. But if we break those things up so that we have a nice nap in the afternoon, then we don't have to spend so much worrying time about being asleep at night. And then by having a nap in the afternoon and you go to sleep at 10, you can probably wake up at 4. And then you can make chanting. Most of us, we hate chanting, we hate 4 in the morning. The reason we hate 4 in the morning is because we want all the sleep that we need, and we don't get all the sleep that we need because we're out there working, expending all of that energy. But if you're already hanging around all day and doing nothing much, then you're not expending a lot of energy. And then you take a nap in the afternoon, and then you can be up early in the morning easy. But we have to rearrange those cycles, and those cycles are nothing but habit patterns of the mind, and you can interrupt those. And in fact, that's part of the reason why they have the only meal that they have at Wat Soan Mokkh is— guess what time? What time does anybody know? Robert knows. One meal a day.

**Speaker B:** 9 o'clock. Yeah, 9 AM.

**Speaker A:** They changed it to 9 AM. I bet that has something to do with daylight saving time, because when I was there it was 8 AM.

**Speaker B:** I believe it's 8 AM for the monks, but for lay people we eat after the monks.

**Speaker A:** Got it. Okay, of course. Absolutely. In fact, in the old days, while the monks were eating, there was quite a buffet racket going on. And so I can see where they put that to an end by making all the lay people wait until the monks are finished, and then they do it. So yes, that's it. One meal a day, 8 in the morning, or in your case, 9, but it's the same thing. But in my lifestyle, that's way too early. And I think that they do that in an important way, because if you just get the idea that there's not going to be any more food today, then we can get used to it. In fact, monks spend very little time hungry, even though they only eat once a day. Some monks eat twice a day, but the first thing that we learn to do is to skip that big, heavy evening meal that we often have before we go to sleep at at night. So in the evening, your sleeping is lighter because you're not spending all the energy to digest the food that you've just recently had. Funny how all of this stuff has scientific stuff to it, but it's been worked out, you know, hundreds of years ago. But our society is not built upon natural living and happiness in the community. The whole society, Western society, that we're born and raised in, is that very world that we've been taught you will find your happiness in that world. We're in fact, oh, boundless joy to find at last there is no happiness out in that world, and look at all the people out in that world trying to find happiness out there and not finding it. So, are you going to find your happiness by being a millionaire or billionaire? Who are the billionaires that you know of that are happy? How about politicians? Not many happy politicians. In fact, the greed for the power, power and the greed for power, is one of the contributions that our whole society picks up on. Everybody catches that power bug. And the reason for that is because of the underlying fear that we put into our young children by ordering them around, punishing them, and all of that kind of stuff. So, in fact, I would prefer, if I had my choice, and in fact that's the way that I work, I would rather have my daughter dumb and happy, than brilliant, out there getting it done, and doing it with the drive that people have to do to get that job done, to be the president of whatever organization, to be the boss of the place, start your own business, have your own employees. And funny thing about that, a plumber who does plumbing is excellent at plumbing, gets popular, and so he has too much work to do, and so he will hire an assistant and train that assistant well, and then he still has too much to do, so he gets another employee. Now he's got a business. Now he changes roles from being a plumber, which he knew very well, into a manager, which he is very bad at because he'd never done any management before. And so, he wants to order his students or his employees around, the way that he feels driven himself. And so, we pick that up and move that right through the culture. And so, the culture that we have is not conducive to a good environment; it's conducive to a productive environment. But the old kings that ran a little area of India called Bhutan, they have autonomy from India. You know, DJ, you're smiling. They don't even have a gross national product. They have a gross national happiness index. They're more interested in keeping their people fed and housed and medicated properly. And adequate clothing. That's all we need. If we had a society that was built upon just the basic needs, then we could spend the rest of the time doing what Robert is beginning to understand that he can do, the Hara, Watsu, and Mo. So that environmental aspect has a profound influence, much deeper than most people give it. I give it about 50%. The other 50% is then done with— you're in that society. Can you start to wake up, guys, to that society that you're in, that makes you want to heave-ho and produce, and is not really all of that interested in your welfare and benefit? And so that's what we have to—.

**Speaker B:** I hear you there. I hear you there.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. So, uh, if we can begin to see the society for that kind of thing, then we want to start to take our leave of it. Ah, hello, Alex.

**Speaker C:** Hello, Dhammarato. Hello, Sangha. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** I see Jeff is also— or excuse me, not Jeff, you've been here, Jeff. David has just joined. I haven't looked at the screen. So, uh, this is a good time to, uh, to then talk about meditation for those who don't have access to the right environment, because we've talked about how important the environment is. How wats and temples and places like that at least give you an opportunity to get out of the society and give you a better chance of being able to do it. And in some cases, like Wat Soan Mokkh, it's absolutely there and available, that everybody's already in that chilled-out space. So what do we do when we're in that world? Well, the first thing that we can understand is there's no happiness there. That's not a place to go get our happiness. The place to go get our happiness is elsewhere. And this is why we want to start spending more and more time in seclusion, to just being on your own. Okay, here's an example of that, that we have to go to the bank and there we are sitting in the bank and the bank is full of people and especially the heavy-duty work. Like getting a credit card renewed and that kind of stuff. Opening a new account is only done by a small group of people at the bank rather than the actual banking done. So you have to wait a long time at the bank. What are you going to do with the long time at the bank? Most of us have a cell phone, so out pops our favorite game, or we go start scrolling through. But what if you don't have a cell phone? Now we get really bored, right? OK, and the answer to that— by the way, this just happened the other day, so this is current news. So the answer to that is you've been to this bank so many times, you know it. And then we say, wait a minute, I was here before. Can I remember now the last time I was here so I could see the fact that this place is not the same as it was? This had 1,000 changes. Let's start looking at what's going on. That door used to be closed and now it's open. Oh, I see all of those tools there on the floor under the ATM machine. So they're off there working on that, etc., like that. And so we can spend our 20 minutes in observation while at the same time noticing our breathing and recognizing that, yeah, the chair— this chair is not a chair that I'm used to sitting on, and now my butt hurts. Well, what am I going to do? Well, why don't we just stand up? All we have to do is stand because we know what's going on. Okay, this is actually one of the ways that we can begin to understand that we can deal with all of life that way. Instead of being bored with it because it's the same old thing and I don't want to be here, we can pay attention to that and to recognize, hey, I'm going to be here Do I have to actually be miserable while I'm here? Because I'm not miserable enough to get up and leave the bank. So my choice is, am I going to sit here and wait for the doctor or for the bus or for the banker or whatever it is? Just waiting for something now becomes a marvelous opportunity to practice. What else are we going to do? Sit here and enjoy the fact that we don't have to be bored here, that we can entertain our own minds that way. Yes, Alex, go ahead.

**Speaker C:** One thing I want to talk about too is a recent experience of mine where when you feel this boredom, you know, one of the ways we can work with the hindrances is we can come along and we can say, oh, I'm bored. What's that mean? Oh, that means that I'm suffering. And then we can apply Four Noble Truths right away. We can drop it. And if it comes back, we can say, oh, the suffering.

**Speaker A:** Is real. I've seen you before. That was about 10 seconds ago and you're back. And then once that happens, maybe we.

**Speaker C:** Can extend the practice further. Maybe we can even do the practice that does not look like the practice always. And this can be, for me, sometimes a smile practice. When I smile, what changes around me?

**Speaker A:** Your whole muscle face. You're built in. You're part of an organism here. Those things, I mean, it's called a feedback mechanism on an airplane. If you put that flap down, you want to know that that flap went down. You just want to, right? You have to have feedback. OK, guess what? The face works both directions. When you have a happy thought, the face will smile. If you have a smile on your face intentionally, not the kind of thing that they talk about of a photograph or saying cheese, but you actually put on a smile, it changes your mind. Actually, the remembering to smile is the same thing that we have to do to remember to smile inside the mind as well as smile outside. It's easy peasy when you understand how easy it is. All we have to do is to remember to do it, because doing it, we practiced before.

**Speaker C:** You know how to do it. And the best part is that you get a double whammy too, because you say, A, you say, oh, I did what I intended to do, smile. And then also, man, anytime I'm out there cheesing so big, anytime somebody comes by and they say, hey man, you got a great smile, And I never heard that before in my life, before I started smiling.

**Speaker A:** So what a feedback loop.

**Speaker C:** What a beautiful thing to start off.

**Speaker A:** Wow. Yes, because that's what our society— you're not supposed to be out in the community smiling. You're supposed to be serious. Grim up, folks. We got work to do. We don't want any frivolity and hilarity here.

**Speaker C:** Exactly. And then people notice, you know, they notice and they say, hey man, what have you been doing? Why you been smiling so much?

**Speaker A:** You I'm getting pretty good at it, huh?

**Speaker C:** Exactly, yeah, you're a great coach. Yeah, thank you for letting me share, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Well, this is part of the practice that we can— because it's really all about Sati. And as you know, what we've talked about with Anapanasati, there's actually basically 4 things that we have to do within Anapanasati But those four things are the Eightfold Noble Path itself. Okay, what is that? Is to wake up, to take a look, make a change, congratulate ourselves. Okay, where is that in Anapanasati? The waking up and taking a look is actually step 9 of Anapanasati, of examining the mind. Step 10 then is the right effort to gladden the mind and make a change. Okay, and so we do that, we wake up and we do that observation and we make that change by gladdening the mind. And we can gladden the mind with the mouth, we can smile our way into it, we can deep breathe our way into it. There's a lot of different anchors that the body has that we can use to bring the mind out of the gutter of having to wait for the banker, right? Or having to wait while your car is being worked on.

**Speaker C:** I even look sometimes in my hands.

**Speaker A:** They have these— paying attention to how marvelous— I mean, look at these things. Every one of you've got a pair of them and you don't pay any attention.

**Speaker C:** Our thumbs are wild.

**Speaker A:** Your hands are marvelous instruments. You can play music and sports and all kinds of things with these hands, and we don't even know it.

**Speaker C:** My hands they're not often as upset as my mind when my mind is upset, you know. So like, I'll notice it. Oh, if I'm upset in my mind and I look at my hands, I'm like, oh, there's some pretty neutral hands. They don't really take sides. And so maybe that's something. It's a nice way to step out of a hindrance if it does tend to arise, right? And it's a great way to get those defilements down too and seclude yourself from those, just like we seclude from the world when we go in.

**Speaker A:** Precisely, that is why the body is in fact part of the practice of coming out of our misery mind state and start working with the body, and let the body help our feelings. Smiling is one of them, okay? We can do other things, but it's up to you to examine and find those things for yourself so that we can integrate this practice. So after we get the mind gladdened up, then that means that we can work with the Sutti to bring on that experience of, "Wow, this is it, I've got it again," which is the Piti, which is the winner part, which is the Samma Sanghappa of the Eightfold Noble Path. So we actually practice Anapanasati by the method of— I was around many different places that considered themselves Buddhist, but everybody had their own definition, "We're Buddhist and everybody else is not," kind of mentality. But everything that they taught, they would teach it in the sense of the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path as a, let us say, the preliminary paragraph of an article that's about something else completely. Yes, and it took me with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa to find out that no, this introduction of the Eightfold Noble Path and the Four Noble Truths is the practice. And we have to keep practicing with these Four Noble Truths and this Eightfold Noble Path to get this Anapanasati that can be done anywhere we are when we remember to do it. And we also, in the beginning, because it does take a little extra effort, is to get away from the bank. Now that's funny. We can go and sit in a park for 20 minutes and enjoy the heck out of it, but I can't sit in the bank waiting for the banker for 20 minutes. I got to be bored and uncomfortable, right? What's this about? It's funny. Yeah, go ahead, DJ.

**Speaker D:** Oh, I was gonna say, often like if a thought like I want to be home right now or whatever comes up, or even at work, right? It's marvelous to come back to the breath and just be like, oh, I'm already home, like already there. That's it.

**Speaker A:** I love that, DJ. That's beautiful. Yeah, we're already home. We can relax. Yeah, and we can relax at the bank for the next 20 minutes. We can sit in the doctor's office with a sore tooth and relax. And when you hear that old drilling machine in the back, we can say, that's his, that's not mine. And then when you sit down in the dentist chair, you can say, I'm temporarily giving these teeth to the dentist. They belong to him. It's his business. And my business is to sit here and relax and let him do his job.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And when we do it that way, life becomes really easy. But we have to remember each item. That's why I'm mentioning some of these, like train stations or airports. I mean, airports are misery hubs. You want to see how miserable human beings are in general? Go to an airport. Always run. There's only a little joy that happens, and that's when somebody gets off the airplane and everybody says, finally it's over, let's go home. I'm more happy to see you because we can go home now than I'm actually to see you, right? Yes. But mostly airports are miserable places. So if you have to go to an airport, the best thing you can do there is to take that great big smile that Alex is talking about Mm-hmm.

**Speaker C:** See how many people will look.

**Speaker A:** Yes, see how many people you can get to smile. In fact, as you walk in the door, says the counting starts now. How many people can I get to smile? Can I get up to 100 people to smile before I get on that airplane?

**Speaker C:** And especially in those familiar places like the bank, one of the things I love to do is to see when I plant the comic seed of my smile, how long will it take for it to ripen? Because not all of them ripen immediately. Some do. Some you flash a smile and they say, "Ooh," and then you get that instant, "Hey, that seed popped.".

**Speaker A:** But if I do— That happens often in Thailand. You will always get a smile return in Thailand.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker C:** And here there's so many people I'll see every day at the grocery store and I'll make sure to give them a big beam. And sometimes it takes a month, but always the seed ripens and it comes and fruit is there. Boom.

**Speaker A:** Oh, hey.

**Speaker C:** And then they say, "Thanks for always being there." One guy I noticed, I said hi to him every day for the last 2-3 months at the grocery store. I always smiled. And just the other night I was coming out of the grocery store and he spoke to me. And what I noticed when he spoke to me was he had a rather heavy speech impediment. And for the longest time I always thought maybe he doesn't say anything because I'm doing something wrong when I smile. And then I realized, oh, maybe he doesn't often say anything because he doesn't feel comfortable all of the time. Talking because he feels insufficient or self-conscious in some way. So I'm not gonna lie, I felt kind of bad at first because I didn't really understand what he said. And then it took a second for me to process, and he says, this is the first time I've seen you in a while without a hat. And I said, oh, thank you so much, because I realized then not only did I see him and smile at him every time, but he saw me and he noticed me every time. So it's like we were both doing the practice that does not look like practice.

**Speaker A:** That's amazing. That's really, really good. Similar thing like that happens is that when I go to the hospital, they remember me.

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And this hospital is a small one, but it takes care of an awful lot of farang who come in with— because they've been riding bicycles and motorbikes and getting caught in the sand and go to the hospital. So they see a lot of people. But I've got several nurses that actually remember me.

**Speaker C:** Right, because you light them up.

**Speaker A:** Because you light them up, exactly. Yeah, beautiful. So this is how we want to start living our lives. We talk about how we're going to live the Dharma. First, light yourself up. Get lightened. Get enlightened. Lighten up, child. And then go spread that light. Spread that joy. That's what it's all about. The two-step process of making friends, first with yourself by lightening up, and then number two is by making friends with that dirty old world we know all about. We have to go make friends with it. I mean, we bought it, we've lived in it. When I talk about living with your own self, warts and all, we have to go love the world, warts and all. And this got some heavy-duty warts. Yep, 100%. But you gotta live in that society. You don't have much of a choice. Yes, at least not now, until you decide that you do have a choice, and then you go do the Robert thing. But for right now, you're still in that world, so recognize it for what it is, see it warts and all, and then start loving to smile at it every opportunity. Anagami, Anapanasati, every human being in there, give them a big smile. They need it. They really do. Every human is desperate. That's one of the things that I got from reading Henry David Thoreau in his book Walden, which he's talking about actually doing this. This was the budding of Buddhism in America, like in the 1830s. And he made the statement in there that all all people live lives of quiet desperation. But we're not always quiet, but we're generally desperate. And that's because we were trained to be that way in the society. That's not how we should actually normally be, that we learn to be desperate because everybody else around us was desperate. It's learned behavior. And so we can learn to take the desperation out and then share that without a shout.

**Speaker C:** And we see that in that, that Walden. We see that he gets in some real seclusion. He may not have called himself a Bhikkhu, but he took up his own robes. And in seeing that, I think he.

**Speaker A:** Had that even to the point of cooking only once a week and, and, uh, and doing— and the day before you cook You gotta eat some pretty raunchy stuff, but he had a pond to keep it in.

**Speaker C:** So yeah, beautiful. It's like you can stumble right into it if you look close enough.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there's a lot of Dhamma in there. Uh, and he— I don't know if he actually mentions the word Buddha or Buddhism, right? But that's what he was doing. That was the 18th, uh, uh, or early 19th century version. Of the Dharma. And so we can in fact go find some seclusion to get away from it all, only to find out that we brought it all with us. And then we have to really do the job of getting away from it all. And when we keep going back and forth and back and forth, like a little while a day in the Dhamma and most of the day in the society, that makes it more difficult. So if we start to practice, we begin to practice more often, and then it begins to filter in so that every time we walk into the bank or something like that, we actually do remember to smile.

**Speaker C:** It's like practice.

**Speaker A:** Or every time we get into the car, we recognize, I normally am anxious when I'm in a car. Let me cool off, settle down, and see if I can drive a little bit slower than I normally do.

**Speaker C:** And a good idea of how this can be talked about in links of dependent origination is if we take apart my old habit of smoking tobacco cigarettes. It was like every meal, every time I got in a car, every time I exited a situation that I didn't like, I'd light a cigarette. And so long I'd do it that.

**Speaker A:** It was comfort food.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it was comfort food, but it was so uncomfortable. So when I'd get in the car, I would instantly make myself uncomfortable because I knew I was gonna have anxiety. It was like some strange idea of like, oh, I've been shot by an arrow, let me shoot myself with a second arrow.

**Speaker A:** As a matter of fact, I think.

**Speaker C:** That the Buddha may have talked about this with the two arrows, right? So hey, worry about whatever arrow you're going to shoot at yourself after you realize you're stuck and bleeding. Fix the sticking and the bleeding. Don't worry about shaming yourself on it. Don't worry about bringing yourself down. There's plenty in the world that can do that for you if you want them to take that.

**Speaker A:** You have to— You're actually right. There is a place where there are two arrows, but the main sutta is called the Simile of the Quail, and it's in the Majjhima Nikaya, number 60-something or another, 65, 66. And but the Simile of the Quail is in there that the guy gets shot with an arrow, and his friends go and bring a medical doctor of the time. And the guy wants to pull that arrow out, and the guy who was shot saying, wait, wait a minute, I want to know who shot me. I want to know what kind of bow he had, what tribe was he in, what kind of Fletcher. I mean, look at this arrow. This— I think I know who uses these kind of arrows like that. And as long as we keep examining this Dukkha. That's what the Mahasi Method really is all about, is let's get a really good handle on that arrow that we got stuck in us. But the actual teaching of the Buddha is, no, you got to go ahead and let that arrow get pulled out. It may have some effort involved with it. It may in fact be a more uncomfortable situation. But if you don't pull that arrow out, it's going to get a lot worse.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** And so you got to get that arrow out of there. And here's the doctor wanting to do it. So shut up and pay attention.

**Speaker C:** Yes, sir.

**Speaker A:** And let that arrow be taken out. So, and in the example, that's what we need to do is to stop thinking about what we're thinking about and start thinking about curing ourselves from thinking about that. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So we can use the analogy here of the, the woman brings her sick dog into the vet, and there the vet is laying on the table, and the dog— and the vet's doing what vets do to the dog because he's doing the caring that the dog needs medically, while the lady who owns the dog is patting the dog, but she's frantic because she cares about the dog while the doctor is caring for the dog. So we need to reverse roles whenever we need to do something, start seeing ourselves as an external physician that's got a job to do, and stop being the patient. Oh, I don't want it done to me. Okay, I don't want to see that these thoughts are unwholesome. That's a painful thing. But if you see yourself from the position of being the physician, you're the dentist here, That's just a tooth. I love that. But when it's my tooth, it really hurts.

**Speaker B:** I know.

**Speaker A:** So this is actually an indication, yet another indication of why we talk about no self in the sense of don't put that self in there. It's not my tooth. It's not my dog. It's just a dog. Let me help the vet do the caring. For and stop caring so much about stuff. So where does that happen? I give you the example of going into the bank. I cared about my time. How dare they make me wait for 20 minutes? I'm an important dude. I even put on a shirt to come to the bank. Give me a break.

**Speaker B:** I love that.

**Speaker A:** And you see how selfish that is and why it does. That's what gives us boredom and that energy. Is because of the selfishness that comes in. So here we go with that. You've heard of the triple—.

**Speaker C:** Um, I.

**Speaker A:** Forgot to call the name anyway— uh, Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta, right? Anicca is going to happen. You're going to have to go to the bank sometimes, right? Anicca is just there. Things are changing. And if there's self in it, then I don't like it when it happens. And therefore there's Dukkha. But when that change came and I'm not there for it, then it don't hurt. Yeah, so when that tooth is being drilled, I don't have to be there to be the one that's hurt. I can be more interested in— by observing, not with the eyes, but with the touch and the feel— what is actually the dentist doing. Look at what the feelings are and the hands and what the dentist is doing. Become that doctor. Place yourself into that position. And then it ain't your tooth anymore. It's just this thing that we're playing with. Mm-hmm. So this is another thing that for laypeople who cannot find a kind of environment right, right around the corner, like Wat Soan Mokkh, you can still build that Wat Soan Mokkh right around you anyway. But you have to build it this time. It's not there just for you to just fall into. This is going to take some effort. We have to keep practicing like that. But what are your choices when you're sitting in that dentist chair? What are your choices? Are you going to be the dentist or the patient? It's your choice. If you could remember that you've got a choice. We never thought we had a choice before. So recognize you have a choice. That's the thing that we have to remember. The remembering, it says, the Sati is, is to remember you've got a choice. We do not have to follow our destiny. We do not have to follow our old habits. We do not have to follow the old mental conditionings. We can do something new here.

**Speaker B:** Always.

**Speaker A:** That's what's so beautiful about the Dharma. Is that it's so easy, all we have to do is to remember, and it solves every problem. Why? Because every problem doesn't exist. There are no such things as problems. We manufacture those things in the mind. So let's manufacture some 'ain't no problem' kind of stuff.

**Speaker C:** Because a lot of people don't have so much trouble, it seems like, sometimes when we explain, 'Hey, these are the Five Aggregates. Where's the self?' And they say, well, I don't see one. And then you ask them, well, why do you have any problem? And they say, well, because this, that, and the other. No, I understand you don't see the self, but you're still imagining it there.

**Speaker A:** We got a budding Dharma teacher here, friends. That's what we're looking for. Yeah.

**Speaker C:** And it's funny because, you know, I remember when I first started to hear the Dhamma, Dhammarato, you told me something along the lines of like, 'Hey, when you sit there and the truck is coming, get out of the way.' And I remember my eyes opening when I heard that. I said, 'Oh, oh yeah, yeah, well, that makes a lot of sense,' you know. And it was the first time someone spoke to me the way that I read some Zen masters talk, and something clicked.

**Speaker B:** And I said.

**Speaker A:** 'Oh, right, I did that, didn't I? That was me who did that.' You know, I'm the one who's standing in the road. It wasn't the truck ran over me, it was I refused to move and the truck did what the truck was doing. Yep, exactly. And that analogy is about all reality, that we keep seeing these trucks coming and we just won't get out of their way.

**Speaker C:** Sometimes we run straight at them.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's the Popeye method, right? You know, let's have some spinach and give me that truck, I'm coming, I'm coming. I love it. We call that the Mahashi method. Yeah, no accident. Yeah, wonderful. Yeah, so let's stop inspecting that arrow. Let's stop with letting those trucks run over us and, you know, just get out of the way. But we have to remember that because other than that, we're going to find the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune hitting us on a regular basis, and all we have to do is just get out of the way. Oh, I saw that one!

**Speaker B:** There it goes!

**Speaker A:** There it went! Yeah, he missed me! Yeah, he missed me again! Sort of like— in fact, you've heard of the movie about The Matrix?

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** This is what this is all about, except that those bullets aren't quite as fast as they are in the movie, but the The whole point is, can you dodge the incoming?

**Speaker C:** Absolutely.

**Speaker A:** You have to make a self there that's a target that's going to get hit with those slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.

**Speaker C:** I mean, when we think about like the Buddha and Devadatta, I think he's a great example too. You know, even though the Buddha, he had troubles when he went home to see his family, he had troubles just out and about in the world. Devadatta's pushing boulders at him. I think he had his foot cut, you know, but it wasn't something that.

**Speaker B:** He was mad at.

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato got a drunk elephant to charge him, but the elephant didn't. Yeah, there's 4 items in that. I'm really surprised that you dug that deep into it because that's not even in the sutras, that's in the Vinaya. Yeah, but still, nothing happened. Yeah, so you've got an enemy, but that enemy is weak and, uh, got his own problems. And any arrows that he shoots at you, if you can see them in time, you can dodge them. Exactly. He's going to have to have some high-powered sniper's rifle to get me. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** But sometimes, I mean, there's guys with sniper rifles out there, you know. Sometimes you're going to get wounded, and.

**Speaker C:** Then you just take a rest, take.

**Speaker A:** A knee, take it easy.

**Speaker C:** I know another thing you taught me is that's okay, start again.

**Speaker A:** Never mind. Mm-hmm. This too, oftentimes it's hard to remember that. Yes, that's what the whole skill that we're trying to develop in seclusion is all about, is taking it and let it go, taking it and let it go, taking it and let it go, taking it and let it go, taking it and let it go, over and over and over again. And a lot of people think that meditation is all about is take it and hold on to do it for their life.

**Speaker C:** No.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, look at it. You want to practice remembering to take it. This is the skill that we have to learn.

**Speaker D:** I'm thinking about this, um, in terms to perhaps use cartoon logic here, but you get hit by one of those trucks, right? Then you get up and you're thinking, oh boy, I got hit by one of those trucks, and then you just.

**Speaker A:** Get slammed Again, right? Uh-huh.

**Speaker D:** Like, that's the thing, right? It's like when the Sati hits and not going into, oh my goodness, how could I have got into that? And just be like, no, let's just gladden out. Congratulations.

**Speaker A:** Right? Yeah, yeah. Check this out and then check out.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, that's it. Like, never mind that, just start again. Okay, we can boogie on down the road.

**Speaker C:** And no more trucks.

**Speaker A:** And there's— yeah, and you see, this is actually quite simple, but we have to be reminded. I mean, this was both Robert's and Jeff's question about where's our motivation coming from. It comes from the Dukkha. That's where it actually comes from. The motivation comes from the Dukkha. Let's get out of here, let's dodge that bullet.

**Speaker C:** And like you're saying about you know, we've got to go into seclusion. I remember in the Army, one of the things they always taught me was you never rise to the occasion, you always fall to the level of your training. So if you sit and your training is such that when that truck hits you, you just expect another truck to come, well, guess what? There's probably going to be another truck and it probably will hit you. But if you train Sati, if you train the mind, if you go into seclusion from the world, from the hindrances, if you sit, you abide in the Dhamma, and you Boop, boop, boop, boop. Then when something happens and you notice Dukkha, almost immediately Sati comes, pow, to cradle for you.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, that's the wake-up call. The Dukkha is the wake-up call. Can we hear that wake-up call and wake up? Exactly, exactly. In fact, most of us think of that in the military reveille. That's the biggest Dukkha of all, is 6 AM. Oh God, I don't want that.

**Speaker C:** And they tell you when you show up, they say embrace the suck.

**Speaker A:** Well, there's— here's something with that military background, you know, about the recruits and the barracks, that generally 1 or 2 days out of the week the DI is going to walk in there with his baton and he's going to make a racket. At about 1 or 2 minutes before reveille.

**Speaker B:** Yes, sir.

**Speaker A:** And he expects everybody to be out of their bunk and standing in attention in front of it while he walks down the aisle. Okay. That's the way that we have to have that kind of can-do attitude because the DI just came. Okay. All right. That's exactly the same story with the Zen stick. I mean, this is not necessarily military. That you got to know the Zen master is there, you're going to get whacked with it. If you lay in bed when that DI comes in at 6 AM, he's going to whack you with that baton and you know it, and you want to get out of his way. Okay, guess what? The whole world is exactly that way. That's how it is. You got to see that incoming and get out of its way. That's what the Dharma is all about, to see that incoming. And when you see that incoming as Dukkha, dodge. Do what you need to do. Stand at attention. Get out of that rack. No, but you, but you gotta avoid the damage. And when you get really good at damage control, that's what we mean by being enlightened. She's got good methods of damage control. You don't get damaged because you're not there to catch the weapons when they fly.

**Speaker C:** Exactly. Best offense, best defense, right?

**Speaker A:** So Jeff, I've got a question for you. Are you around? You may have gone to sleep. Oh yeah, there you are. Yes, I have the question for you is that, does this talk today talk to you about the motivation that you were asking about? Especially talking about Especially the part about you've got a choice of whether you're going to keep this pushing and make it really easy, or you're just going to let it go and quit a while and let it soak in and then come back and start pushing again. Yes. Yeah, everybody makes both of those choices in life. I mean, life's pretty long, and sometimes we feel like a nut and quit and then come back to it. And sometimes we don't say, no, I'll just do it a little more. I'll just remember I'm not going to walk in the bank and be miserable. I'm going to walk in the bank and smile and have a beautiful time there. Yeah, but sometimes we let it go. Sometimes we let it slip. And that's okay. Stop fussing at yourself. We're, you know, become friends with inside. Stop making all these rules about what you should do and recognize that at every moment you've got a choice.

**Speaker C:** Today I went and I visited my mother in the hospital because she's been in there since last night. She has some kidney function and whatnot that's declining a little bit. It caused her some delirium, so she maybe was talking to someone that wasn't there when she was hanging out with my aunt. They knew enough to say, hey, Mom, we're going to the hospital. And when I got there today to see her, I was concerned because it's always scary to see your mother in a hospital. And so I had to throw out the rules though. I had to clean out the mind because I knew when I went inside I didn't want to just give her the power of prayer in a false way. I wanted to show her the best her son could be in such a bummer circumstance so that she had something to look forward to to come out of the hospital with, right? So what I did is— and Jeff, thank you for talking with me because it reminded me, we talked about walking meditation, and it's a beautiful campus at the hospital. So I walked and I breathed and I counted my breath with my steps. 5 steps in, 5 steps out. I got everything nice and even. I basically worked myself into a good Jhana there. And then when I went inside, I made sure to do the practice that did not look like practice. I smiled to everyone, even when I put the mask on, because they'll see you even with the mask on. It's in your eyes, it's in your forehead, it's your whole face, the billboard for all this. So I smiled, I got other people smiling. Oh, smile, smile, smile. So when I finally saw my mother, then she's already almost smiling. Then she sees me smiling when I come around the corner, and instantly, ah, good. Now we both don't have to be concerned right here and right now, because we're both right here and right now. You know, I'm worried for what happens when she comes out, and I'm worried about what she's done in the past. But in those moments, I knew, hey, this is me, this is Mom.

**Speaker A:** You can't change the past by worrying about it. Oh, it depends. So why worry about it? Oh, she did this, that, and the other thing. Oh, this kidney stone is going to be terrible because of all the bad behavior. And no, we don't have to have those kind of thoughts. We can say, hi, Mom, I love you right now. I don't care what happened, and we don't know what the future is going to be, but right now, ah, I'm so happy to be here with you.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, and it was— so that would be— oh, sorry.

**Speaker C:** Oh, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker D:** Um, that would be like caring for her though, right? So rather than like, you know, you're.

**Speaker A:** Caring for her, you started caring about it. Because when you care about, oh, Mom, how are you feeling? 'Oh my goodness, this hospital stinks. I don't see how you can tolerate it in here.' You know, how many times have you heard that kind of language in the hospital?

**Speaker C:** 'Why aren't you people taking care of her?'.

**Speaker A:** 'Why aren't you people taking care of my mother better than this?' Right?

**Speaker C:** When really it's like, you know, I know that I need the non-attachment. If I have to outcome, I can bring my A-game to her. Boom. I can give it to her.

**Speaker A:** That's my gift. My gift is my stability, my smile.

**Speaker C:** My ability to be there in the present with her. And then she's able to take that, and guess what? It's not as if there's no reward right there in the moment. This is the fruit of the practice, the right here, the right now. You know, when your mom's in the hospital and she's just sitting there just frowny in the face, because who likes hanging out there? It can't be any better than the bank, right? Get it on, man. It's where it is. This is where the work is to be done, is in the here and now. So I had to throw out the rule that I needed to run into the hospital to see my mom because I needed to make that lap and bring it around and bring that up.

**Speaker A:** Excellent idea. Excellent, excellent. So this is how we go about it. We've got choices. Can you remember? You've got choices. You've got efforts to put in, okay? And you have a choice about are you going to just let it go and just go ahead and be miserable in the bank, or you're going to remember you don't have to. And kick yourself in the butt. Never mind, put on a happy face.

**Speaker C:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** You'll be okay. Everything's going to be all right. Everything, you know, is like, be nurturing instead of, oh no, I've got to wait for so long. I wish they'd hurry up. I hope it doesn't take me as long to do what that guy's sitting there doing. He's been there for 20 minutes. That means I'm going to have to sit here for 20 minutes, you know, extra. You know, so that's the way that the mind thinks, and we call that logic. And what it's not— it's not logic. That's not logic. Trying to figure out how long you got to be there is Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** But.

**Speaker A:** You don't want to be there. But if you recognize, oh, I don't want to be in the hospital or in the bank, but I'm going to be here anyway, Then that can wake up and say, oh, I've got a choice. I can either sit here in the bank and be miserable, or I can sit here and enjoy the heck out of it. My choice.

**Speaker B:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** And that choice is available in every occasion. It may, in fact, that choice may come up in that 20 minutes sitting in the bank 5 or 6 or a dozen times. I have to keep reminding myself Hey, I don't have to go back into my misery, that's just an old habit.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker D:** It really adds to the confidence factor, I think, too, of caring for the moment at hand instead of caring about it. Like this actually, yeah, it's just like, oh, this is actually just the right thing to do. Like it just works as opposed to all this worry because again, even Even with like driving or something, if you're like worried about it or whatever, you're not going to be paying attention to the road. But if you're there and you're like, okay, we can handle this safely, and you're confident and all that stuff, and you're paying attention, it's so much more smooth, right? As opposed to like freaking out about it.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. So we can bring Buddha mind to anything that we remember that we can bring it to. You have to remember that you can do this.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** And also think about what your boss sees when you show up if you're late and you're driving, you know. If you're there and you're cruising the whole way and it's nice and easy, you're going to show up calm, cool, and collected. When some guy shows up calm, cool, and collected but late, it's a heck of a lot easier for me to overlook the tardiness. Because otherwise what happens is you've got this guy that's blasting the vehicle down the road and then blasting through the parking lot. He comes in sweaty, disheveled, upset already, frustrated, yelling, "Forgive me!" And it's like, oh, That's a whole lot, man. But if you take your time coming.

**Speaker A:** In— yeah, he's already punished himself a lot for being late, right? And he could have enjoyed his trip and be late. Exactly.

**Speaker C:** And he's probably not helping the guy who he's late to see feel better about him being late.

**Speaker A:** He might have not been able to make it at all, having an accident on the car because he was in a hurry to get to work.

**Speaker C:** So much that we do.

**Speaker A:** And so that's what I'm talking about, about the world has no happiness in it. And when we're caught up in the world, when we are, when I am in the world, but as Jesus said, be in the world but not of the world. Don't buy into all of the misery and the trouble. If you're late for work, go in happily. Don't go in upset because you're late. Yeah. I mean, we could give— Alex, you and I can come up with one example after another after another, because this is, this is what is reality.

**Speaker C:** It just keeps coming, and, and all.

**Speaker A:** We have to do is remember to look at it, and then we're okay. So the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune are whizzing by all the time. All we have to do is dodge. Spurgeon, how do you think about this?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's great. I have to be honest, I wasn't in the best mood when I started on this call, but listening to you guys, um, I'm feeling good.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so the call itself does some of that. Yeah. Yes, I really resonate with what you said earlier in the talk.

**Speaker C:** You said a lot of things about.

**Speaker A:** Society and there's no happiness to be found in society. I'm wondering, do you think like, how often do you think we should take breaks from society? Every time you remember, take a break every time you remember. The boss is standing in front of you yelling at you, or the DI. Remember right then, you can take a break from that. You can take a deep breath, look at his mustache, you can look at his nose hairs.

**Speaker C:** I used to get in trouble a lot when I was a young, young private because I always thought of myself like a tiger. So when something like that would pop out of the bushes and it'd start yelling at me, whether it was a drill sergeant or someone else, and I'd stand, I'd try to do everything that they said, but almost honestly, almost every time I'd stare right in between their eyes. But then I couldn't help it, they would smile, and I'd get my ass fucked up.

**Speaker A:** Excuse my language, but it was tough not to smile because, you know what.

**Speaker C:** All that you put on top of a situation, really your true nature comes out. And I've yet to meet any man on the planet whose true nature did not consist at least a little bit of a smile. So when you go ahead and you take those breaks, those— I think I've heard them called by other people like micro hits or whatever you want to call it, you know, where you get just a second, poof, oh, my breath. And then that just brings you right back home, like DJ said, right back home. I'm here, I'm now, there's nothing to do, there's nowhere to go, this is the dance. So this in and of itself is a seclusion. But I mean, if possible, one of the great things, if you look at like meditation charts and illustrated in different books and such, you'll see that the meditator is almost always chasing after something. Then when he gets it, he rides it back to the market. Every time he rides it back to the market.

**Speaker A:** There are so many. Yeah, the Zen's got those stories. Tibetans got them, right? Uh-huh. That in fact, before the journey, that mountain was a mountain. And then I went to the mountain and saw the mountain, and then I came back to the valley, and now the mountain's just a mountain. Been there, done that.

**Speaker C:** T.S. Eliot said, we're never going to stop exploring, and then when we get back to the spot that we started at, we're going to see it for the first time.

**Speaker A:** Because we're looking at it for the first time. Before, we didn't look because we thought we knew it already, just starting point. But now we have to keep Remembering to keep looking, to keep looking. There's a lot of stuff going on there. All— I mean, that's what Anicca teaching is all about, is, hey man, this is a busy place. We gotta— you gotta watch what's going on always. Well, at least every time we remember. Do you ever think though that we should take a break from that? Like all these things that are coming at us, like, like just secluding ourselves in the, like, what? We've talked about one end of the scale. Let's do some more. Okay, so there's immediately to wake up and take a break from that stuff, and then there's an hour to go sit or to go take a long walk like Alex was talking about. That's the second level. Okay, the third level is like Taking the weekend off, doing a weekend retreat, taking it— in fact, that's what we really mean generally by taking a vacation, like taking transportation and changing your location, is literally called getting away from it all. You can sit right there at your desk all weekend and don't think about the work at all. It doesn't matter where you are. It's the fact that you can get away from it all up here for a weekend. And then the next level, I would say, would be like a 7-day retreat, maybe a 10-day retreat of getting away from it all. And this is where you have a whole lot of businesses in business of giving people a chance to just literally get away from it all.

**Speaker C:** Maybe they cook for you.

**Speaker A:** And then the next level is, is that maybe a 3-month retreat and people do that in the West. They plan for it. Another way to do it is, is get yourself a ticket and come to Thailand and start hanging out and finding it. That's what I mean. Robert had so many, many questions. And now he's at Wat Soi Mok for a few days, he recognizes he doesn't need any questions answered, he needs just to be here where he is. All right, and so then the next one would be the Thai traditional one, be 2 years, to take 2 years off, ordain as a monk, that would be the Thai traditional style. And then there's also a 5-year plan. I would say offhand that in my lifetime I have actually retired 4 times. 'Cause they did the first one, the first three just didn't stick. But one of them, but one, you know, some of them lasted for years and years, and then you get back into it. That's just what it's like. So getting away from it all, and then there would be the possibility of doing it for a lifetime. That you just came on a one-way ticket thinking you'd do 3 months. You wind up just hanging around because you found out that you would eat. You're not going to starve, that they were lying to you when they said if you don't work, you don't eat. That only happens in Los Angeles. Here in Hinayana, that does not happen. Basically, what they're saying is, is that if you don't work, we're going to starve you to death. That's what they're actually saying. And so getting away from those who would starve us to get product out of us, and go find some people that are friendly enough to feed you when you're hungry, and then you don't have to worry about that 'you don't work, you don't eat.' So, how many different options are you looking for? An immediate, instantaneous, an hour, a weekend, a week, a month? A year, 2 years, 5 years, up to you. You can't starve in Thailand anyway. There's fruit trees everywhere. You can just eat the fruit. That's exactly right. That's exactly right. Almost all of the fruit trees in all of the houses around— there was one tree I remember for sure that the whole yard seemed to be covered with oranges. We drive by that house and the whole yard would be covered with oranges, because they don't go out and pick the oranges, even to throw them away. They just left them on the ground. Very productive orange tree. I mean, they could have gotten 5 or 6 cases of oranges off the ground. How long could you eat off of 3 cases of oranges? Enough to get tired of them, I'm sure. And that was just by walking by and seeing that house. Okay, so most people The fruit trees were planted by people who never had an intention of using that tree as a fruit tree. It was a decorative item. Before the lightning storm hit it, we had a tree got knocked down. It's only 50 feet from here, but it was a Lam Yai tree, big piece of fruit. And there were people on a regular basis, even people we didn't know, would come with a great big long stick to beat in that tree to knock those, uh, uh, Lumiai, uh, uh, things out of the tree. Very interesting like that. In, in America, you'd never see— get off my property! You know, that's why I'm the eye tree, and you're not going to get one of them. Nobody is. I'm not going to have them. And if you can't, and if I don't have them, nobody's going to have them. That's a decorative tree now. That's the whole mentality. But here in Thailand, sure, you can find any tree that's got bananas on it. Go take a banana. Nobody cares.

**Speaker B:** Hey, what's up, guys? Sorry, sorry, my phone died before, so that's why I suddenly disappeared. So I've charged it up now and I raked some leaves around the main area. And now we're back.

**Speaker A:** Great, great. Well, we're just finishing up on the question is, well, how long should I take a break for? And the answer is take a 5-second break right now. Take a break, take an hour break later today.

**Speaker B:** Take an hour off from work or what?

**Speaker A:** Well, from whatever he's got on his mind. It may be an argument with the teacher, whatever it is. It may be at the bank when he doesn't want to do something. It may be on the bus where the seats are hard. Wherever you are that you don't like it and you want to get away from it, get away from it. You, the one who is in it, go away. And the choice is yours always about how much time that it's going to take. That we were just talking about you before you came back on, Robert, about being at Wat Soi Mokkhun. Before you came, you had so many questions, one question after another. Now you don't have so many questions. Now you're there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, sometimes they answer themselves.

**Speaker A:** Yes, earlier, if you look, you'll get the answers.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, earlier I was thinking about like, um, what do I do with all that happiness, because I always have this, like, not always, but I have like a strange sort of uncomfortable feeling where it's like I'm happy, but there's nothing to do or be or have. And so it's like a weird discomfort. It's like I'm happy, but where does this go, you know? And then I was just like thinking like, well, I can just— the question kind of answered itself a little bit later. Because I just wasn't worrying about it and the answer just came like, just do whatever, but at least you're like happy now that you're doing it, you know, there's like a background of happiness and peace and stuff. So you can still just do whatever.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. So that question just worked itself right out, didn't it? As long as you were asking the question, you were miserable, and when you forgot about the question, everything was okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it tends to go like that.

**Speaker A:** And then you saw that and you said, oh, I forgot all about that.

**Speaker B:** Pretty much.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** And the good thing is, you know, when you work on this, when you develop your practice, you're going to find some stumbles, some things like we talked about, but never mind, start again. And the best part of it is though, that when you get to a point where you feel confident with your practice and you take it out into the world and you start to walk around and you start to feel the things like Robert's talking about, like a happiness, but a happiness without without this reason behind it, you know, like I didn't just get something, I didn't just do something, why am I happy? What do I do with this happiness? Like he said, the questions answer themselves. And the best part of it is, it's you that's asking the question. So you get to look at it over and say, hey, what is the question? What is it? And the answer is inside of it. So it can be frustrating at times, but when you get to a point in your practice where you feel like, oh, this is the amount of time I need, Well, that's the amount of time you need to take. And then when you go out, you reality test it. You say, how long did it take for the hindrances to come back? How long did it take for this, that, or the other thing? How do I feel when I follow the breath for 20 minutes as opposed to 30 minutes? And you can do all of this and you can measure yourself out your little dosages if you need to. But truly, you know, there's 1, 2, 3 ways. Just take the time that you need because you can only buy the things that cost time with time. You can only buy the things that cost money with money. So if you're worried about money, worry about money. But if you're worried about your time, just pay close attention to that time. It'll show its own value. And when you are confident in that value, you'll understand how much of it you must spend where.

**Speaker A:** Right. So the last point that you were mentioning, Robert, is that you almost feel uncomfortable by being happy. That somehow or another you're not supposed to be happy.

**Speaker B:** Yes, like there— it shouldn't be like, um, like there should— I should be happy and then I should use it to do something. I shouldn't just sit there. Um, it's sort of like a sickly sweet, um, flavor to it where it's like I'm just sitting there in this, this wholesomeness but I'm not doing anything with it. It feels unproductive, it feels a bit wrong, it feels a bit I know.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Yes, this is— remember we talked about giving yourself permission to be happy? Okay, now here's one more point about that, and that is, is that if you did go do something with that happiness, that in fact you got a new tool and you know how to use it and you go put it to work, then the tool is more fulfilling than if it's just a tool, right? But what we're actually looking at though is that by having the happiness and immediately or very quickly you start worrying about, well, what am I going to do with it? Now you've taken your mind off of the happiness onto putting it to work. And how do you do that? So it's almost like this. The guy has a knife and he sharpens the knife, but as soon as he gets this going, he says, this is good enough, I got the knife sharp enough. And so he goes and he starts cutting some stuff, but he recognizes knife not sharp. Okay, I sat in that bank and got miserable. Okay, the knife is not sharp. What do we do with it? We go back and we sharpen it some more. And that's what you have the opportunity at. What's so in milk is to keep practicing, keep sharpening your knife, knowing that there will be someday in the future when you're going to need that sharp, that knife being really sharp.

**Speaker B:** Yes, razor sharp, right?

**Speaker A:** You need a razor sharp knife.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** So in other words, when people are miserable around you, you're going to have to have a purty sharp knife to cut through that so that you can bring them joy and happiness. So the two— joy. But here you are saying, I've got joy and happiness, and immediately you're saying, oh, well, what am I going to do with it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Yeah. So we need to keep practicing and get that joy as your habit, and then wherever you go, you will be using it. And then you don't have to worry about when you're going to put it to work. You're going to be using it when it's really, really sharp. So the job is to get it really sharp, not get it a little bit sharp.

**Speaker B:** Just keep sharpening.

**Speaker A:** Just keep— yeah, just keep sharpening.

**Speaker B:** That's what I need to do, right?

**Speaker A:** Just— and if you get it to the point that you've sharpened it all the way, so there's no more blade left, that's, that's amazing. Just keep sharpening that knife. Just keep sharpening it. That's how you do. Because wherever you go in the world, when you're sharpening that knife, you're sharpening your knife is the benefit for the others. You don't have to actually worry about helping somebody. Just like on this particular call today, we're just enjoying the Dhamma. We're not trying to shove it on somebody to fix them. Yeah, we're just having a ball, just.

**Speaker B:** Sharing, just sharing and chatting.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. So all I'm doing is just sharpening my knife here, folks. I'm just, you know, I'm just whittling away.

**Speaker B:** Go ahead.

**Speaker C:** Can we see Watsu and Monk Robert? Can we see some of it?

**Speaker B:** Is my camera working?

**Speaker C:** Yes, I see the beautiful painting.

**Speaker B:** Oh, is it facing me or away from me?

**Speaker A:** It's got your photo in it, so you turn the camera around and move it around. Just turn your phone, cell phone around. Yeah, there we go.

**Speaker B:** It's not working on my screen, so I'm just gonna hope that this image—.

**Speaker A:** It'S good right now. Just keep moving around.

**Speaker C:** That's so gorgeous.

**Speaker A:** You can see how old some of that furniture is. And look at those vines, great big vines.

**Speaker C:** So gorgeous.

**Speaker A:** Amazing vines. Okay, that's the old, old— I know where you are. I know that thing.

**Speaker C:** That is so cool. Thank you, Robert. See, that's some Dharma sharing too. I appreciate it so much.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. You're very welcome.

**Speaker C:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** He's going toward the toilet, folks.

**Speaker B:** There's the dining area behind it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's the sala behind. And you've only seen just a tiny part of it. To think the whole Arya is more than 400 acres.

**Speaker C:** Wow, how gorgeous! And what a time to live in that we get to just ride around in your phone with you, Robert. That's so amazing.

**Speaker B:** I know, it's awesome, right?

**Speaker C:** Oh wow.

**Speaker A:** So there's no— oh, I see a dog, but I don't see many people around. They've already left.

**Speaker B:** Yes, the breakfast ceremonies.

**Speaker A:** Okay, where you got it right now, the bench area is where the monks sit, and now where he's pointing it is where the lay people will sit and do the chanting. Now it's back over to where the monks sit, and the monks over there. Wow. Ah, that's that old building. Monks really like to hang out in that place. Comedy Central for the monks.

**Speaker C:** Oh, how beautiful.

**Speaker A:** Little ponds and things. Yeah, that's the building I'm talking about.

**Speaker C:** Oh, so much culture.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that one. Yes. Okay, this statue that he's going towards, you see it's black. That statue is actually 1,300 years old. It was dug up on the property. This is back at the time when Chaya was part of the Sri Jayakumara Empire, along with Angkor. So that statue shows that Thailand, South Thailand, was Mahayana in 700 AD.

**Speaker B:** Wow.

**Speaker A:** And that statue was 13— have you ever dug up anything in your yard that's 1,300 years old?

**Speaker C:** Oh, look! Wow.

**Speaker A:** What's that a statue of? It was a Bodhisattva. Oh, Bodhisattva. This is a new museum that's been built for Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. Ah, and there he is, front and center.

**Speaker B:** Wow.

**Speaker A:** That'S amazing.

**Speaker B:** And his mom there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, this is his mom. Beautiful. There's another one of those stone things and another one there. So it really is a garden of liberation, sir.

**Speaker C:** That's amazing.

**Speaker A:** I know where he's standing. I've been there. He's going back to this, back to the dining hall now. No, wait a minute. Anyway, so there's— it really is a nice place. We got so many places like that in Thailand, but this is really a— really a forest one. Thank you, Robert, that was really great.

**Speaker C:** Thank you so much.

**Speaker A:** So let's go ahead and finish this call. I think that we've had quite a lot. I've had about as much joy as I can stand right now. Let me go have some misery, folks. I'm out of here.

**Speaker C:** Take care, Mr. Dhammarato, everybody. Thank you, Sangha.

**Speaker A:** Thank you, Robert.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, everybody. Thanks, guys. Lovely, lovely to meet you all.

**Speaker C:** See you next time, friends.

**Speaker B:** Bye-bye. Goodbye.


### Summary

Here is a summary of the Dhamma talk with Dhammarato and the Sangha friends:

**Core Theme:** Finding and sustaining motivation in Dhamma practice, especially when feeling stuck or when practice feels like a chore.

**Key Points & Discussion Flow:**

1.  **The Central Question:** Robert, from Wat Suan Mokkh, asks how to use Dhamma skills (like replacing unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones) for self-motivation.

2.  **Motivation's Source & Nature:**
    *   **Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing)** is presented as the ultimate motivator because it reveals the profound peace of the Dhamma.
    *   True motivation isn't about forcing action, but a natural inclination toward peace and being fully alive. The goal is to be "motivated to be here, to be alive."

3.  **The Natural Ebb and Flow of Practice:**
    *   It's common to have periods of strong practice followed by fallow periods. This isn't necessarily bad.
    *   **Analogy 1 (The Swing/Car):** Starting practice is like pushing a heavy swing or car—it takes effort. Once moving, less effort is needed, but if you stop entirely, you'll have to push hard again to restart.
    *   **Analogy 2 (The Breakthrough):** Stories of a Sanskrit scholar and Zen calligraphers illustrate how stepping away from intense focus can allow insights to integrate subconsciously, leading to a masterful "click" upon returning.

4.  **The Power of Environment (A Major Emphasis):**
    *   Your surroundings profoundly influence your mind. Being in a noble, peaceful environment like **Wat Suan Mokkh** allows you to "soak up" the atmosphere of equanimity and kindness effortlessly.
    *   **"Just chill out":** For Robert at the wat, the instruction is simply to be present there, not to strive in meditation. In a conducive environment, peace can arise naturally without struggle.
    *   For those not in such an environment, creating seclusion and consciously choosing where to place attention becomes more critical.

5.  **Practical Techniques for Daily Life:**
    *   **Smile Practice:** Intentionally smiling changes your mental state and creates a positive feedback loop with the world.
    *   **Reframing Boring/Difficult Situations:** Use waiting times (at banks, doctor's offices) as opportunities for mindful observation and gladdening the mind.
    *   **"The Practice That Doesn't Look Like Practice":** Bringing a mindful, joyful presence to everyday interactions is itself a powerful practice.
    *   **Using the Body:** Paying attention to neutral body parts (like hands) or sensations can help detach from upset mental states.

6.  **Overcoming Internal Obstacles:**
    *   **Sleepiness in Peace:** If you get peaceful and fall asleep, it's okay. It means you're relaxing. Don't fight it; proper rest will lead to clearer wakefulness.
    *   **Discomfort with Happiness:** Robert notes a strange unease when happy with "nothing to do." The advice is to **keep "sharpening the knife"**—deepen that happiness as your default state through practice, and its right use will become apparent naturally.
    *   **The Two Arrows:** Don't add mental suffering (the second arrow) to initial pain or difficulty. See problems as tasks for your "inner physician" to address, not as personal attacks.

7.  **Core Dhamma Frameworks:**
    *   The practice is applying the **Four Noble Truths** and **Eightfold Path** in the moment: **wake up** to suffering (Sati), **look** at the mind, **make a change** (Right Effort), and **congratulate** yourself.
    *   **Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta:** Suffering arises when we impose a static "self" on changing experiences. Letting go of that "self" in difficult situations (e.g., at the dentist) reduces suffering.

**Conclusion:** Motivation is maintained not by willpower but by repeatedly remembering you have a **choice** in every moment: to buy into the world's misery or to gladden the mind and engage with a smile. The path involves both formal seclusion and bringing this mindful, joyful attitude into all of life's arenas. The talk ends with a virtual tour of the serene Wat Suan Mokkh, embodying the peaceful environment discussed.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this talk, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate the practice of Dhamma, meditation, and motivation. Here are the main ones:

---

### **1. The Swing (or Pushing a Car) Metaphor**
- **Description:** Compares starting and maintaining meditation practice to pushing a child on a swing or pushing a car on a flat road. At first, it takes effort to get it moving, but once it’s going, it requires less effort to keep it going. If you stop pushing, it eventually slows down and stops.
- **Purpose:** To explain how motivation in practice works — initial effort is needed, and periodic “pushes” help maintain momentum.

### **2. The Zen Calligraphy/Art Training Story**
- **Description:** Describes a traditional Zen training process where students first learn to make ink and brushes for years, then practice art for years, then take a long break (e.g., 10 years). When they return, everything “clicks” and they become masters quickly.
- **Purpose:** To show that breaks in practice are natural and can lead to deeper integration and mastery.

### **3. The PhD Linguist Story**
- **Description:** Tells of a PhD student who solved a long-standing Sanskrit grammar puzzle after taking a summer off. When he returned, fresh and relaxed, the solution came to him.
- **Purpose:** To reinforce that stepping away from a problem (or practice) can allow insights to arise naturally.

### **4. The Gardener vs. Garden Enjoyer Metaphor**
- **Description:** Some people at a temple are like gardeners — always working, clipping, and busy — and don’t actually enjoy the garden. Others simply sit and enjoy the beauty and peace.
- **Purpose:** To highlight how striving too hard in practice can prevent us from simply “being” and experiencing peace.

### **5. The Two Arrows Sutta Reference (Simile of the Quail)**
- **Description:** References the Buddha’s teaching about being shot with one arrow (physical pain) and then shooting yourself with a second arrow (mental suffering). The wise person avoids the second arrow.
- **Purpose:** To teach non-identification with pain or difficulty — don’t add mental suffering to physical or situational suffering.

### **6. The Dentist Chair Analogy**
- **Description:** When at the dentist, you can either be the anxious patient or adopt the perspective of the dentist — curious, observational, detached from “my tooth.”
- **Purpose:** To illustrate how changing perspective (from identified sufferer to detached observer) reduces suffering.

### **7. The Matrix / Dodging Bullets Metaphor**
- **Description:** Likens dealing with life’s difficulties to dodging bullets in *The Matrix* — with awareness, you can see “slings and arrows” coming and step aside.
- **Purpose:** To emphasize mindfulness as a way to avoid unnecessary suffering.

### **8. The Bank Waiting Room Scenario**
- **Description:** Uses waiting at the bank as an example of an ordinary, boring situation. Instead of being impatient, you can practice mindfulness, smile, observe details, and turn it into a meditation.
- **Purpose:** To show how daily life offers endless opportunities for practice.

### **9. The Sharp Knife Metaphor**
- **Description:** Compares meditation to sharpening a knife. The goal is to keep sharpening it until it’s razor-sharp, not to immediately use it. When it’s sharp enough, it naturally serves its purpose.
- **Purpose:** To encourage consistent practice without being impatient for “results” — the sharpness (awareness) itself is the tool that will be used when needed.

### **10. Society as a “Misery Hub” (Airport, Workplace)**
- **Description:** Airports, banks, and workplaces are described as places where people are generally unhappy, rushed, and stressed. But you can choose to bring a smile and peaceful presence there.
- **Purpose:** To contrast Dhamma practice with conventional society’s values and to show how practice can transform ordinary environments.

### **11. Monkey See, Monkey Do / Nesting Instinct**
- **Description:** We naturally adapt to our environment. If you’re around noble, peaceful people, you’ll start to embody those qualities without forcing it.
- **Purpose:** To stress the importance of spiritual community (Sangha) and environment in supporting practice.

These metaphors and stories are used to make the teachings relatable, to illustrate the balance between effort and ease in practice, and to show how Dhamma can be applied in everyday life.
