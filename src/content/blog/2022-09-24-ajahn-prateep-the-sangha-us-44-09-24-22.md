### Transcript


**Speaker A:** And you can just hang in there.

**Speaker B:** Okay, cool.

**Speaker A:** So we're going to start the video again. I hope it gets started. Do you guys have any indication that the video is running?

**Speaker B:** It's recording.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it's recording now.

**Speaker C:** Okay, I see it.

**Speaker B:** All right, your video's not on though.

**Speaker A:** Excuse me, what?

**Speaker B:** Your video isn't on.

**Speaker A:** Are you keeping it off? My video? Alright, I'll turn my video off, and then back on again. How does that work?

**Speaker B:** No, I don't see you. I might have to get out and come back in.

**Speaker A:** Alright. Let me turn the video off again. And then back on again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no, it's my screen. It's my screen. So I'll hang up and I'll get back on and hopefully everyone will see everybody.

**Speaker A:** All right. Alright. There, now you're on, Eric. Okay, so let's go ahead and start. Because today we have a really honored guest, Ajahn Piti, from Chicago. I'll let him give you the name of the wife. And from what I understand, he met Kishon. And I knew that I wanted to get our guys interested in going to the watch, but I had no idea that we might in fact entice some of the senior monks to come and talk to us. And so we're really honored. And that one of the things that happened with me that gave me— this is possibly one of the most important lessons that I ever learned. And it happened after I was at Wat Suwan Mokkha a few months, but hadn't ordained yet. And Ajahn Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and Ajahn Po actually had a large gathering of people there. That was a mixture of Westerners, Thai laypeople, and monks. And Bhikkhu Buddhadasa wanted it to be translated, what he was saying, in Thai-English mixture, for me to then interpret what he was saying. And he started talking about the Four Noble Truths. I remember specifically And after I translated that much, and looked back at him for the next thing, he says, "You take it from here and give this lecture." He literally put me on the spot, to find out that I did have that much detailed knowledge to give a talk on the Four Noble Truths. And it really did actually kind of cement my knowledge of the Four Noble Truths, that I knew it better than I thought I knew it, because I had to put it out in front of my teachers, my friends, everybody. And so that was one of the things that I also recognized that Ajahn Prateek had mentioned when he was saying that it was like his teacher threw him on the other side of the river. And he had to figure out how to get back across without giving him good instructions. And so this is part of the way that the teaching is done. Now, there's kind of a line to be drawn in there someplace, and that line would be, in fact, in the Pātimokkha, there is a mention that monks cannot hide robes or bowls. From one another. You don't go messing with the guy's equipment, because monks get really in the habit of being mindful about where they put things. And so that kind of trick playing is not done. But the kind of trick playing that monks do, the senior monks do, to the junior monks, to wake them up. And that story about the Four Noble Truths with Ajahn Po and Bhikkhu Buddhadasa having put me on the spot that way, it didn't happen just one time. It happened over and over again. Did I remember that at the retreat center. Aichan Po says, "I want you to talk about the Seven Factors of Enlightenment.

**Speaker C:** The Sambhojana.".

**Speaker A:** But at least he gave me an evening's notice, so that at 7:30 the next morning, I was able to teach it. But I taught it right out of the Anapanasati Sutta, so I had my book. In fact, Here it is. And so, I was able to own up on it that time. But this is the kind of thing that happens, is that monks are called on to give a talk, sometimes on a specific question. And that it's a good idea to already know what we're talking about here, to go ahead and get the Dhamma. Understood, to get it down. That, that's one of the qualities of teaching that's very profound. In fact, in the Anguttara Nikaya, there is a passage— or actually, it's a whole— Rocky, no. Pardon?

**Speaker D:** Oh, apologies, just talking to the dog.

**Speaker A:** There for a second. Okay, sorry. All right. So, it's in the Anguttara Nikaya, a sutta about 5 ways to learn the Dhamma. The first one is, naturally, to listen to it being taught. Another one is to discuss it with your friends. Another one is to mull it over in your mind to make sure that you understand it. The fourth one then, has to do with the chanting, of understanding that the chants that we do, what the Pali actually means. That in fact, that was the way that the monks learned it in the very early days, is they learned the chants first, even though they were in the native language, and then they learned the explanation to the chant. Because it's kind of confusing, and so you have to have detailed understanding. Like in the Anapanasati Sutta, it looks like that they just rip right through it, and then they rip right through it again, and leave out all the little details that are popped all over the other sutras. And so then the fifth way to learn is by actually teaching. And surprisingly enough, that's the way that it's done. Like, an example would that be in graduate school, the graduate students normally teach the undergraduate students. Because that's how you learn to teach, is by teaching. But you have to really know your topic also. And so this is part of the reason why we want to talk about it over and over again, to repeat it, to do it one— look at this way, look at it that way, come to it this way. All of a sudden, the teacher kicks you in the pants that way, and then you begin to understand what the teachings are all about. So, I would like to give each one of you an opportunity to introduce yourselves to Ajahn Prathip, and if you want to, you can ask him any questions and see what kind of surprises he comes up with. Not to put you on the spot, Ajahn, but we've just been talking about that's part of what we do here. Put each other on the spot.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Eric, do you have any questions? You've got a real Thai Achan here. Anything to ask him?

**Speaker E:** You're putting me on the spot too. First, I would like to ask, how are you?

**Speaker C:** A little bit cold. It starts to be cold today.

**Speaker E:** Okay, yeah, it's really cold.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** And for how long have you been ordained?

**Speaker F:** Uh, 20 years.

**Speaker C:** It will be 20 this year.

**Speaker E:** 20 years of ordination?

**Speaker C:** Yeah. Wow, I'm almost 43. I'm almost 43 right now.

**Speaker E:** You look much younger.

**Speaker A:** Yes, he does. Because of— That's half Thai and half Bhikkhu.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I wouldn't really know what to ask except of what we talk about weekly.

**Speaker A:** Yes, do, please.

**Speaker E:** These days, after our last call, I had been talking about how your personality or your way of being socially or in private too changes by practicing the Dharma. And sometimes it's part fear or part doubt, maybe it's got some hindrances within it, but sometimes I find myself changing too quickly and losing my sense of self. Not sense of self, but like one hindering thought is that I wouldn't know how to be if I change too quickly by practicing the Dharma. Maybe it's something that doesn't happen if you're in a context of a Buddhist community, but I don't know if you've had similar thoughts.

**Speaker C:** Um, I would like you to repeat again.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, let's say make it short.

**Speaker A:** He's talking about that as he begins to change, he begins to lose his identity and he doesn't quite know who he is anymore. And then the last part of the question was, does Sangha have anything to do with that? Which certainly it does. Once you lose your identity, if you're associating with monks, then that becomes your new identity. But if you're out in the world of lay people, then you may not have an identity. That's the direction of the question.

**Speaker C:** Identity?

**Speaker A:** So, Arhat, Arahant.

**Speaker C:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Or he's asking that inappropriate question of who am I?

**Speaker C:** Okay. Or also, I may have a way to explain in my way. Maybe I can explain you through the example. First, For example, I'm angry at someone so much, you know, so I already have a thought, you know, it's an Anagami. But after I put a lot of effort in the meditation, try to use my mindfulness long, long time, And one moment later, a moment, maybe long time, it's been for me, for Mahayana, it's been 2 years of meditation. And one day I start to get to know, you know, this word I already learned from the book, that is not who, is not him. It's not anything, you know, why you have to angry with him. Yeah, but I keep repeating this to myself, but a part of my mind still know that I still angry, you know. But one moment during the meditation, it gives me just like this information attached to my mind that, hey, it's no us. No him and no me. It's just mind doing its activities. I felt that even him, he didn't want to do something bad to me, you know, but he cannot control his mind. But his mind is just automatically to think. For example, when you have your taste, you also like this taste. Or you have just, you know, just mean your taste, your anything that once you see it, you will like it. And our mind just act by itself. And so no intention, I felt that that day, some kind of the knowledge that I read from the book or the master taught me It's just I start, my mind start to know, not me, you know. For me, I understand for a long time. I know what he's saying, that you will have to practice until you felt, until you feel that no, it's not we, it's not us, it's not him, it's not Arhat. Yeah. And then the anger just lift up and I don't angry anymore. For me, just like— and it will appear to— it's just like your mind got a new information and it become your basic knowledge inside that. It appear, it will appear for us when we think how how we think, how we decide, it will be based on this information, you know. It's just like, just come from inside. And it felt better because I didn't have to manipulate myself that, hey, it's just okay, and Four Elements, why I have to angry him? But this time, just feel nature. It is right to the Question?

**Speaker E:** Well, I'm having some language barrier problems because it seems that I'm not that used to hearing the Asian accent in English. I'm from a Latin American country, so I just got the rough idea of what you were saying about how the practice helps us drop personality view, like in general, and that generality helps in the specifics of every situation. Is that right, or did I— Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, it helps us to see things as is, true reality. Yeah, that is no us, no him, no he, no who. Just like that.

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And— This is— Go ahead.

**Speaker C:** This is— I answer you to the direct question. I don't know that— Maybe I also have the— Yeah, okay.

**Speaker E:** I mean, that opens further questions, but I don't know if anyone else is going to ask something else. Do I ask further questions or not?

**Speaker A:** First off, I'd like to say welcome, Robert. I haven't seen you in a while, glad to see you back.

**Speaker C:** Is this Robert in United States?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the other Robert, not Robert Cohen, but I'm glad to see you. We got two Roberts.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, we got both Roberts. I was wondering which one.

**Speaker A:** Cool.

**Speaker D:** Howdy, guys.

**Speaker E:** Hi.

**Speaker A:** So, uh, to finish off a little bit about that Anatta is, is that it's always a duality, that we can actually best understand it in the sense of selfishness. That's a good English language word to use, but because the word 'self' has many, many different uses, but selfishness generally is fairly well understood. And when we are selfish, that means that we withdraw or separate ourselves from others. Like, you cannot get angry unless you're selfish, and you're selfish because you're trying to protect yourself. That's the fear, and we use anger to protect our fear, right? And so that selfishness is created at the time when the feelings are created, or about the same time. And so we also, when we create the self, we create the other, and this is the duality. And Ajahn is mentioning that when we can see that other guy is just like me, that we're all in this anger thing together, then we don't have to be angry at each other. That even the anger can become kind of unified. We're all in this together, and that kind of breaks out into compassion. Why should I be angry to this poor guy just because he's angry at me? Because there's really not much to me anymore, and I can see more we than me. But if all I see is me, then all I see is him too. And so if we think of it as we rather than me, now we're back into a cooperative moment, even if that cooperation is within anger, at least then it has a chance of melting into friendship rather than exploding into more selfishness.

**Speaker C:** And my point is, we all learn those terms selfishness, atta, or anything. But how can we transfer this knowledge to our mind? This is what I'm trying to say. Do we know how to transfer this knowledge? Because It's not if your mind can accept all these truths, so you won't be angry anymore, right? But if you're still angry, it means that there must be something. So that's this knowledge— why your mind cannot accept it and why you're still angry. You understand what I say?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, like a practice, because we still want something. Yeah, still. And one of the things that we want is revenge.

**Speaker C:** You know, it happened all that, you will know how to revenge. It will come over and over, but you still have to be patient. And try to stay with those feelings, and you will see the nature of anger, that it will disappear by itself. It's come and gone, come and gone, until it never comes again. And those issues, you will overcome that problem, and you won't angry at them anymore. But the new issue, you're still angry, but you can handle it faster. This is from what, from my experience. The first issue for me is the most difficult.

**Speaker E:** Regarding that issue, I've noticed that something that hinders me is that I feel a pressure from the people that know me, or from what I imagine of what they expect from me. Like, once you have a personality, people expect you to be the same or to maintain that personality. Personality. So if you change like at a rapid pace, it feels weird, like somehow inappropriate. And I know that the general answer is to keep practicing, get into isolation, but I was wondering if you've experienced that in your process and how to— let's say, what can you say to yourself internally, wholesomely, a wholesome thought regarding not caring or not placing any importance into what people expect your personality to be like?

**Speaker C:** Okay, this problem may come from your mind thinking about someone else's thoughts, right? Your mind caring about someone else's thoughts.

**Speaker E:** My mind is caring?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, you care about someone else thinking, right? Their expectation, their thought about you, and you feel pressure.

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker F:** So.

**Speaker C:** That'S the way I practice, I practice the mindfulness meditation. So you don't need to rush the result, but you just only look to your mind, that your mind just thinking, your mind just carrying. And then you will see the nature, you will see the nature of your mind, the nature of that feeling, that even that feeling just occur for a while. And it cannot last long. A moment later you think about something else, it's gone. And you keep your mind repeating that. For me, in Buddhism, you may heard how to gain the wisdom. You can have the wisdom by Sutta Mayapanñā. Have you ever heard? Sutta Mayapanñā, to listen. Jhāna Mayapan��ā, it's just like to think. Rational. And the third, Bhavana, Mahayana, Pañña, is some kind of meditation. This way, or this way, the meditation for us, we don't try, we try not to think, or we don't hold any thought to anything, but we just use our mindfulness.

**Speaker A:** Another way of saying it is, look at what's happening, look at what's going on with your body, with the air around you, etc., like that, rather than talking to yourself about it. Use your mind moments for investigation, actual investigation. Imagine, Mike, that you're a professor sitting in front of a microscope, and that you're peering into the microscope and finding this, and then you write it down. And then you find this other thing, and you write that down. And while you're seeing this and writing it down, when you're writing it down, you miss something. It's better to stop writing things down, or talking to ourselves, or giving ourselves a running dialogue, and just look at what's going on. And this is the training, the Bhavana, the word that he was mentioning, Bhavana, the training, training, looking at what's going on. Look at what you're doing. And sometimes when you look at it, you see that selfishness. Us directly.

**Speaker E:** Okay, diaper changed.

**Speaker A:** So Robert Cohen, do you have any questions? You have any comments, anything to say?

**Speaker D:** Um, none right now at the moment, but I'm really enjoying this.

**Speaker A:** Good.

**Speaker D:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** I don't know what happened to Miguel. I think he dropped his phone. Yeah, I must have.

**Speaker D:** Miguel, are you there?

**Speaker A:** No, he's not there. So, Arahant, this is a very interesting topic that you bring up, and that many people will actually say that Anatta is the major teaching of the Buddha, and that we see that a lot. In the Trilokana, you have the three characteristics: Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta. And the Anatta is there as third, but a lot of people don't understand that the selfishness and the Dukkha are interrelated. That Anicca means that everything is changing. And if you don't like it, if there's self there, then there is Dukkha. But if you take the route to change that into Anatta, then the Anatta is not Dukkha. The reality is, is that the Buddha doesn't teach anything about Anatta much other than how it fits in in the creation of Dukkha. But that's the real point. Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Come out of Dukkha is all what it's all about. And the way that we do that, basically, is by dropping selfishness. Become friends. That in fact, the issue is kind of funny, is that not only is the selfishness there among others, with others, but we have individual selfishnesses inside. We have a crowd inside. There's various selfishnesses. One is the selfish rules. The other one is the selfish little kid who doesn't want to follow the rules. And then there's something else that doesn't want to play that game between the a parent and a child. All right, and so we wind up being a crowd inside because of individual kind of selfishnesses. And when we can drop those selfishnesses and see that there's a 'we' inside instead of this me and that me— oh, it says you cannot join. Citta. Oh, okay, so there's something wrong with this system right now. Back to the whole point about the multiple me inside, that if we can learn to unify them, and the way that we can do that is by stop giving ourselves critical and wholesome thoughts, which is one of those selfishnesses. Okay, that we literally talk ourselves into feeling bad. So the one who is talking us into feeling bad is the one who we need to work on first to get him to change his mind, change his attitude. And it's also wrapped up with a lot of rules. In the teachings of the Buddha, it's Sila, Patha, Paramita. Attachments to rights, rules, rituals, attached to the way things are supposed to be. But that's who I am. I'm the ritual part of the mind.

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And you're supposed to do it the way that it's done.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I think that's what I'm doing.

**Speaker A:** And we can come out of the ritual part of the way things are supposed to be done.— because we can now begin to see that that's unwholesome. Because the other part of the mind is going to be selfish also, and rebel against that. So here we are, as a parent giving orders, and as a child doesn't like it. So the child has several options. One is to do what he's told to do, get along, go along to get along and resent it. He could in fact choose to go along to get along happily, but we don't get that lesson from our parents. They go along, get along, and resent it, so we're supposed to go along and get along and resent it. Or we, in our resentment, can begin to rebel from it, and we half go along And that's what's called passive-aggressive, is because we half go along and then we.

**Speaker F:** Rebel.

**Speaker A:** Or we half go along and then, instead of rebelling, we feel guilty for only half doing it. And so those are the choices that we wind up with: going along and getting along and hating it, rebellion and hating it.— or feeling guilty and hating them. And it would be better if the dialogue between the parent and the child was nurturing. Therefore, the child feels good inside, and the parent feels good also. This is how we begin to stop the selfishness inside of our own minds. Because when you break your own rules, there's a little bit of fear in there because you might have to punish yourself for it. And so now we've got an executioner coming in there, okay? That in fact is kind of interesting that this parent— we use it in the sense of protection, permission, and potency. In the sense that if you do something without permission, now the parent is going to be the executioner. And so we wind up with all of these various ways of being selfish on the inside, turning it against other selfishnesses on the inside. And we can see that stuff if we look. And when we see it, it's a good idea to put it down, to change. That's what Bhikkhu Buddhadasa is really all about, is let's make a change here. Let's see all of these rules and the rebellions and whatnots, and the punishments, the bad feelings, and all of that. And start to nurture, nurture your mind. You're okay, you're okay, everything is all right. You don't have any work to do. In fact, getting put on the spot, there's nothing to it. But you have to get put on the spot a lot until you recognize that there's nothing to it. Oh, Achan, thank you for.

**Speaker C:** Coming.

**Speaker A:** Back. Hello. So we were expanding while you were gone. We were expanding on that issue of selfishness, that they wind up being the mind broken up into various pieces. Each one of them is selfish. Like for instance, all the rules. We want to selfishly obey the rules. And then there's another part of the mind that wants to selfishly disobey the rules and not do it, not do what we're told to do. And so, the way of dealing with selfishness is recognizing that it pops up in the mind in various forms. And one selfishness is the result of another selfishness. And so, let's begin to see this stuff, and that every time that we can see the selfishness, we can make a change. It takes the right effort, the right noble effort to make a change. What did we change it to? To nurturing. Everything's okay. In Anapanasati, the Sutta, talk about coveting the mind. Well, I don't have to give that rule to myself only to break it. You got to write that email. I don't want to write that email. 'You gotta write that email.' 'I don't want to write that email.' Okay, these are two different kinds of selfishnesses. 'You write the email' is one selfishness, and 'I don't want to write the email' is another selfishness. And we can say, 'Aha, I see you, Mara.' And once we can take that and gladden the mind a bit, we've just already come out of the selfishness. The job that needed to be done has just been done. We just came out of Dukkha into Nirodha. And so in that regard, there is no real you self, because you've always been a crowd of this kind of self and that kind of self, and this up and this down and back and And then we go around asking questions like, "Who am I?" And we come up with confused answers, because we never really did take a look to find out what was in there anyway. And so it's much better then, according to the Sutra number 2, the Sabbha Asava Sutra, is our wise Our wise reflection, our wise inspection should be geared toward: Is this wholesome or not? Is this Dukkha or not? Rather than: Who am I? Because if you're asking the question: Who am I? That's in Dukkha already, and if you can see that Dukkha, you can say: Hot dog, now I can see see what's going on. So this is what the Buddha recommends, is don't pay attention to who I am and don't pay attention to the selfishness, but instead pay attention to what is it that causes Dukkha in the mind. You know, how does wanting things create dissatisfaction?

**Speaker E:** I just pinpointed my issue with what you were saying right now, is that, for example, when I hear you talking and I see your whole demeanor I am like, I'm clear of what Sukkha is. Like, I can feel it within me. And also, if I'm by myself and I have been, if I'm in a good mood and I'm practicing correctly, I also can feel Sukkha, and I also am clear about what it feels like and how to maintain it. But when somebody comes in and I get a bit rattled or shaken. It's like I lose perspective of what the measure of Sukkha is. I lose my reference point and I try to find it, but I cannot.

**Speaker A:** Find it in that moment. All right, you use the word when they come in, you get rattled. Yeah, right, you get all shook up. Yeah, what whatever mental music they're playing, you start to jigaboo to their beat. You get rattled, get all shook up, right? Okay, now that you know that, if you are aware and mindful that when someone is coming in, before they open their mouths or do anything, you can say, all right, time to get on guard. Wakey wakey, look at what you're doing. Normally you go into sleep and then get a rattled mind. This time we're going to stay awake. This time I can handle it. This time we can do it. Okay, so you kind of plan in advance, something like Dukkha, 5 seconds ahead. You know, and you and you say, okay, we're ready for this. Incoming is the other word. That's a more modern one from New Warfare, you know.

**Speaker F:** Incoming.

**Speaker A:** But in the Dhamma language, we talk about it in the sense of Sati. Wake up, start paying attention, look at what's going on. Dukkha is coming.

**Speaker F:** Incoming.

**Speaker A:** Look at what's happening. And you can do that joyfully. You can recognize when they come in, they can't addle me, I'm not going to get rattled this time. And then you may be able to handle that conversation for 5 minutes before you get rattled. But hey, that's a great improvement, because before you'd get rattled right when they come in. Every time they come in, you'd get rattled. Now you can get it, get your mind together so that when they come in, you can handle it for a minute, 2 minutes, 5 minutes. Pretty soon you can handle the whole conversation, not ever get rattled. Then you can come away from that conversation, yeah, I can do that. I can clean out my mind and keep it clean and be in the present moment. I can apply my mind to the wholesome and sustain it there for a while. That's the way that we can think is, yeah, you can handle that conversation. You know now that we're talking about it that you can do this. You can, if you can remember before the conversation starts, the knock on the door, the footsteps down the hallway, or whatever it is, and wakey wakey, something's happening, something's coming, be.

**Speaker E:** On.

**Speaker A:** Alert. Yeah, take that deep breath and I'm ready for anything. I can handle anything.

**Speaker C:** I can do that.

**Speaker A:** For my.

**Speaker F:** Suggestion.

**Speaker C:** Okay, from my suggestion, if you want to practice meditation, I've been there before.

**Speaker A:** That someone— Bhikkhuni, last time you're breaking up.

**Speaker C:** I can't— Anagami, no, I don't want them to see. I start.

**Speaker A:** Thinking, so to Very sorry. Can anybody hear Eric? Can you.

**Speaker D:** Hear him?

**Speaker A:** Can you hear me? No, it's all broken up.

**Speaker C:** Uh, do you.

**Speaker E:** Hear.

**Speaker C:** Me? Yeah, if you hear me right now.

**Speaker A:** It might be helpful because I think that your microphone setting in Skype is such that it catches it and then it suppresses and catches it.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, someone just called me on my phone.

**Speaker A:** Just— oh, I don't know what happened. All right, all right, now we can hear you better.

**Speaker C:** Okay, you hear me already? Okay. To be, let's say.

**Speaker F:** From the Tathagata.

**Speaker C:** The definition of Sati means to realize things quickly, right? So when you practice meditation, before you reach to Sukkha, You need to train your basic ability of your mind. You know, you might have some kind of qualification to train. First, you have to move in any part of your body, just like to make it controllable. The second is you have to be fat. Through the mindfulness meditation. And so when that moment happened, someone— sorry, the second, to aware in your ears quickly, your eyes, your nose, your tongue, your skin. Your body, even your mind. For example, if you sit in the room and you heard something, and then the next moment you think about it, right? If you don't heard it, you don't think. But you heard and you think, and then you realize that someone comes in. And when you think, and it makes you feel. So What if you can handle the first time.

**Speaker F:** You hear?

**Speaker C:** That's it. You will cut off the process that will happen after. You got what.

**Speaker F:** I mean?

**Speaker C:** Just be mindful when you start hearing. But your mind are fast enough or not? And this is the problem, that our mind is not fast enough. I have example for you. Maybe it's tonight or tomorrow, if you are about to be Anagami, Arhat, Bhikkhuni, You yawn, right?

**Speaker F:** Yawn.

**Speaker C:** A moment you are going to yawn, you know that, right? If I'm about to yawn— Before you yawn.

**Speaker F:** Uh-huh, like.

**Speaker D:** This.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, before you yawn, you will know that, right? Yeah, you will know that fairly. You keep in your mind, repeat the word, about to yawn, about to yawn, free to play.

**Speaker F:** And.

**Speaker E:** Let'S see, you're cutting off.

**Speaker C:** And then you understand what I mean. The voice that's attached to your ego— sorry, I heard the sound from anywhere. If you can block sound that might come into you with your Anapanasati, it will cut the process later, will be.

**Speaker D:** Cut off. Prateep, you're cutting a lot.

**Speaker A:** We can't really hear you.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I don't know what happened to.

**Speaker A:** My phone.

**Speaker C:** I.

**Speaker A:** Try to. Robert, what I'm picking up on what he's saying is that we have to train the mind to be fast. That a lot of stuff is happening in the mind that we're not paying attention to. And as we practice Anapanasati, as we practice the meditation, The actual point is that we begin to speed up, so that what we used to be able to see, now we can see the cause of that. And then as we speed up the mind a little bit more, we can see the cause of even that. That in fact, the speed of the mind is all about understanding Paticcasamuppada. Or in Thai it's Paticcasamuppada.

**Speaker C:** And.

**Speaker A:** That the point is, is that we learn it in forward order, in the sense of knowing step by step the sequence of events that causes the results of Dukkha. But now we're going to start backing up. So that we can see things a little quicker and a little bit earlier. And one of the main resting points is at feelings, because if Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about having wisdom at the point of contact so that we then can control the feelings. And so that's one of the places, but we need to be really fast. That happens within like, you know, a fifth of a second or so. And so we can actually get to the point of recognizing that I see it and I like it. If you can be mindful— The next step is, do I want it? Can I catch that I like it before it ignorantly goes into wanting? And so that's a very key point to back up so that we're fast enough so that we can see when I don't like something. That doesn't mean that I have to go and do something about it. That I can merely just not like it. In other words, we take control through wisdom of knowing when we like things and we don't like things, rather than ignorantly having to do something about our likes and our dislikes.

**Speaker F:** And your mind to be fast enough.

**Speaker C:** To block the sound and then do.

**Speaker F:** One thing about it. But if you're slow, you will hear it and then you start thinking, Hey, what happened? Who comes in? And then you start your emotion and it might happen. But if you are fast enough, which you can, but you have to learn through the walking and sitting meditation, and then one day you can do it. For example, right now you have to.

**Speaker C:** Move your mind, go to your feet.

**Speaker F:** Right now, and then your mind is.

**Speaker C:** Very fast right now.

**Speaker F:** Right now already, but in the concentration mode, you are focusing on something, you are not unaware. And so once you.

**Speaker C:** Hear it, and then you start thinking.

**Speaker F:** So that's why I asked you to try on yawning. If you catch a moment that you're going to yawn, inside your nose quickly, about to yawn, about to yawn quickly, and let's see what happens. And it will block everything, your yawn.

**Speaker A:** Will disappear. Actually, there are many, many different thousands of techniques.

**Speaker F:** Anicca, and then you— sorry, Yeah, you're yawning. It's something like when we talk about it, someone will yawn. But you have to catch, just like you shoot an arrow to that point, and you can. It's not— this one for me, I think, is a The easiest one. You see, it disappears. So what happens if you can block your thought first when you start to think and you're not in your mind thinking, thinking, you just— it will stop. And then you're not starting creating or any emotion that might happen later. But if you are slow and it starts to produce emotion to your mind, it may be tough work for you to deal with it. And yeah, you can make it calm down again by meditation and try to be Anagami. So when we sit, our sensation It's still working, you know, your body still work, your heart still work, but you need to point your mind specifically, just like you point to your yawning. If you point your mind to other part of your body, the yawning appear, still appear, you know, it's still yawning. So the point is still important to you. Where it happen is where you have to focus. But so when you see things, you focus here. When you hear things, hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, your body, your itchy, you can train with your itchy too. Itchy, itchy, itchy, and then you see the itchy until it's gone. Without scratching. Also the pain, this one will be very important. The.

**Speaker A:** Most difficult.

**Speaker F:** You know, for everyone, even me. But I don't know how long when you practice meditation and you always walk before you sit or not. Did you walk or just sit? If I walk— Just like, do you do walking meditation?

**Speaker E:** Not that much, but I do it.

**Speaker F:** You should, you should. Because it's just like, athletic need to warming up their body before they play sport. Your car need to be.

**Speaker A:** Warming up. Get the.

**Speaker F:** Breathing going.

**Speaker A:** Sorry, sorry? I said, get the warming the body, get the breathing going, the same opportunity. Opportunity with chanting. Chanting before the meditation also gets the.

**Speaker F:** Body warm. Oh yeah, it's just like you can.

**Speaker C:** Relax your another part of your body too.

**Speaker F:** And just like make your blood and system flow. Yeah, blood and pleasure flow better. It's good. And when you said your back always straight. It's just like if the string on your bow loosens, you cannot shoot through anything. So the first rule should be your back always straight. But hey, the gravity, your back can be bowing, you know. You just push back to that point. To know how's your back straight, it's just like you push your back until you cannot. And bend down a little bit and put down a little bit. And that is the straight point. Always back to that. And then this kind of another power that you might need to collect. You know, there are 10.

**Speaker B:** Kinds.

**Speaker F:** Of power. The power of discipline, the power of I didn't remember all, but I remember all in time. The power of Panna, you know, just like your mind needs to practice on giving, just like, and it will expand.

**Speaker A:** Another ability of your mind. The power of the training, the power of repeat, repeat, repeat, do it over over and over and over.

**Speaker C:** Again.

**Speaker F:** And the power of— the power of— I don't know, it's just like you keep— for example, you want to practice for 15 minutes and then you have to finish it. You cannot stop before the time's.

**Speaker A:** Up.

**Speaker F:** And So that's the commitment we all need. In Thailand, we all have to train, you know, even for lay people. So don't lose your promise. If you lose your promise, you will fail on the meditation, even your business.

**Speaker A:** Or even your life.

**Speaker F:** Just like that.

**Speaker C:** But let's go back to the the problem.

**Speaker F:** That is the process of emotion. You see things, you hear things, from your side you think about it, and the next moment it will mix with your defilement inside, from your taste, your sight, your greed.

**Speaker C:** Your anger, You're cutting out again.

**Speaker A:** And then if you— yeah, your phone is cutting out again.

**Speaker C:** But how can we be fast in our meditation?

**Speaker F:** It depends on how good you.

**Speaker A:** Are practicing.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, and this is where.

**Speaker A:** I learned. Aichan, we're having trouble hearing you. It's broken up.

**Speaker F:** Breaking up. Not much, but much the knowledge. But the mindfulness first. For If you open, who do you want to find first, student or teacher?

**Speaker C:** Teacher, right?

**Speaker A:** Do you hear me?

**Speaker C:** No, not clearly. Sorry.

**Speaker A:** Do you hear me? It's very difficult to hear you. No, you're.

**Speaker E:** Breaking up. Yeah, we can hear you for like a couple of like like 10, 20 seconds, but then it starts to break up.

**Speaker F:** Maybe it's.

**Speaker C:** From my mobile signal.

**Speaker E:** But I do understand what you were saying about the technique of yawning, and I could do that right now, and I'm going to try to apply it in other situations.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, so we will focus on training our mindfulness, more than training, more than focusing on concentration, you know. Just like you have to train your teacher before you.

**Speaker C:** Find students.

**Speaker F:** If you have too much students but you are not good enough, you cannot handle the emotion during the meditation.

**Speaker C:** So.

**Speaker F:** You should try to train the sitting and Anapanasati meditation. While you're sitting, once you hear a thing, you have to move your mind to your.

**Speaker C:** Ears quickly.

**Speaker F:** Hearing, hearing. If you cannot you have to remind your mind that no, you may, you know, it's your mind and your body is not the, it's not, you know, it's separated, you know. It won't follow you, you know. For example, when you're angry, you hear me?

**Speaker A:** Oh, do you hear me? No, it's.

**Speaker F:** Not good.

**Speaker A:** Our conversations. Normally every week.

**Speaker F:** A little bit over.

**Speaker A:** An hour or so. And I do very much appreciate that.

**Speaker F:** You'Ve come on.

**Speaker A:** This time. Robert, are you still there? How about. Miguel, are you on? Gail has been there for.

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, Robert, let's. Let's sign off now. Do you have any our conversations normally every week, a little bit over an hour or so. And I do very much appreciate that you've come on this time. Robert, are you still there? How about Miguel? Are you on? Miguel has been there. Yes. Okay, Robert, let's sign off now. Do you have any final things to say, Robert?

**Speaker D:** Um, none at all.

**Speaker A:** All's good. Thank you. Okay, if you don't mind, give me a call later today or tomorrow.

**Speaker D:** All right. Okay, that would be great.

**Speaker A:** I think tomorrow would be perfect. All right, we'll do that. Great. Eric, thank you very much for your, for your question, and I'm recognizing that you're listening very carefully.

**Speaker E:** I appreciate that. Thank you for spending your time with just.

**Speaker A:** One student. And Miguel, I don't know where you are. Go ahead, Eric.

**Speaker E:** No, I appreciate the time and the energy you're putting into this. And I hope you can join us in another time. Maybe you can tell us more about your life, your your 20 years as a monk. I'm very interested in hearing your experience, what it's been like to live as a monk in the States and to get to know more about you.

**Speaker F:** Okay, I appreciate that and I'm willing to join your conversation.

**Speaker A:** Thank you, thank you. Yes, I have been talking with many students during the COVID time. I would not talk very much about coming to Thailand. But now that COVID is finished, several of the students want to come to meet the monks here at Wat Soan Mok and at Deepa Bhavan, Anicca, that sort of thing. But I also want to get the students in America to become interested in visiting and staying close to monks. That are there in the United States. So thank you so much for coming on, and I very much appreciate you spending time with us. I'm sure that we will find many students who become very deeply interested in the Dharma and want to have some time with senior monks like yourself. Okay. Okay, so thank you so much. Thank you. Okay. Bye-bye, everybody. Bye. Thank you.

**Speaker C:** Cheers.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key themes and discussion points:

**Core Theme:** The talk centered on **the practical application of Buddhist teachings to overcome suffering (dukkha)**, with a strong focus on **non-self (anattā)**, mindfulness, and the teacher-student dynamic in Dharma practice.

**Main Discussion Points:**

1.  **Learning by Teaching:** The host (Speaker A, likely Dhammarato) opened by sharing a personal story about how his teacher, Ajahn Buddhadasa, unexpectedly put him on the spot to teach the Four Noble Truths. This illustrated a key method of deep learning: truly integrating the Dhamma comes from discussing, reflecting, and ultimately **teaching it to others**.

2.  **The Nature of "Self" and Suffering:** A significant portion, prompted by a student's (Speaker E) question about losing his sense of identity through practice, explored **anattā (not-self)**.
    *   The visiting monk, Ajahn Piti (Speaker C), explained from experience that through mindfulness, one can see that anger and reactions are not personal but just "mind doing its activities." This insight loosens the sense of a solid "self" and "other."
    *   Dhammarato expanded on this, framing **anattā as the dropping of "selfishness"**—the protective, separating ego that creates duality (me vs. them) and leads to conflict. He described the internal mind as often being a crowd of conflicting "selves" (e.g., an inner rule-maker, a rebel, a punisher).

3.  **Practical Mindfulness & Breaking the Chain:** The discussion turned to **how to apply this insight in daily life**, especially when reacting to others.
    *   The student's issue was getting "rattled" by others and losing his inner peace (sukkha).
    *   The advice was to use **mindfulness as an early warning system**. Before an interaction, one can mentally prepare: "Wake up, something's coming, I can handle this."
    *   Ajahn Piti emphasized training the mind to be **fast and alert** enough to catch sensory impressions (like a sound) *before* they trigger a chain of thought and emotion. He gave the practical exercise of noticing the very first sensation of a yawn to see how interrupting the process early can stop the automatic result.

4.  **Supporting Practice:** Supportive practices were mentioned:
    *   **Walking meditation** was recommended as a "warm-up" for sitting, helping the mind and body become alert and settled.
    *   The importance of **commitment** (sitting for a determined time) and **posture** (a straight back) was noted as providing the stability and "power" needed for practice.

**Overall Tone & Conclusion:** The talk was informal, experiential, and focused on direct application. It concluded with gratitude for the visiting monk's time and an emphasis on the value of connecting with the Sangha (monastic community) for support and deeper learning. The key takeaway is a path from intellectual understanding of non-self to a lived experience of it, achieved by training moment-to-moment mindfulness to dismantle habitual reactions and the underlying sense of selfishness that causes suffering.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary metaphors and stories are:

**1. The "Thrown Across the River" Metaphor:**
   *   **Used by:** Speaker A (attributing it to Ajahn Prateek's teacher).
   *   **What it is:** A metaphor for a teaching method where a teacher challenges a student intensely, forcing them to find their own way and resourcefulness. The teacher "threw him on the other side of the river" without instructions, so he had to "figure out how to get back across."
   *   **Purpose:** To illustrate how being put on the spot (like being asked to teach unexpectedly) forces deep integration and understanding of the Dhamma.

**2. The Story of Being Put on the Spot:**
   *   **Told by:** Speaker A (about himself).
   *   **What it is:** A personal anecdote where Ajahn Buddhadasa, during a talk, had Speaker A translate and then suddenly told him to continue and give the lecture on the Four Noble Truths himself.
   *   **Purpose:** To provide a concrete, personal example of the "thrown across the river" method. It shows how being forced to teach cemented his knowledge and revealed he knew more than he thought.

**3. The "Crowd Inside" / "Multiple Me" Metaphor:**
   *   **Used by:** Speaker A.
   *   **What it is:** A metaphor describing the mind as containing a crowd of different inner voices or "selfishnesses"—like an internal parent (making rules), a rebellious child, and a guilt-ridden part.
   *   **Purpose:** To explain the concept of *anatta* (not-self) in a relatable way. It illustrates how what we call "self" is often a conflict of different impulses. The path involves unifying this crowd through nurturing rather than internal conflict.

**4. The "Professor at a Microscope" Metaphor:**
   *   **Used by:** Speaker A.
   *   **What it is:** A metaphor for mindful investigation. One should be like a professor observing phenomena under a microscope, simply noting what is seen, rather than getting caught in a running internal dialogue ("writing it down").
   *   **Purpose:** To contrast intellectualizing about experience with direct, non-judgmental observation as a core practice of meditation.

**5. The "Yawning" Technique & Metaphor:**
   *   **Used by:** Speaker C (Ajahn Piti).
   *   **What it is:** Presented as both a practical exercise and a metaphor for the speed of mindfulness. The idea is to catch the very initial sensation of a yawn (or any sensory input) with sharp, fast awareness before the mental chain reaction (thoughts, emotions) unfolds.
   *   **Purpose:** To teach that developing fast, precise mindfulness can "cut off" the habitual process that leads to emotional disturbance. It's a training tool for speeding up awareness to intercept *paticcasamuppada* (dependent origination) at its source.

**6. The "Warming Up" Metaphor:**
   *   **Used by:** Speaker C (Ajahn Piti).
   *   **What it is:** Comparing preparatory practices (walking meditation, chanting) to an athlete warming up before a sport or a car warming up before a drive.
   *   **Purpose:** To emphasize the importance of preparing the body and mind for seated meditation to ensure better energy flow and focus.

**7. The "Bow and String" Metaphor:**
   *   **Used by:** Speaker C (Ajahn Piti).
   *   **What it is:** Comparing a straight spine in meditation to a taut bowstring. A loose string (slouched back) lacks the power and tension needed to "shoot the arrow" (achieve focus).
   *   **Purpose:** To give a vivid, physical reason for maintaining proper posture to generate mental power and alertness.

**Summary:** The talk uses a blend of **personal stories** (being put on the spot) and **vivid metaphors** drawn from nature (the river), social dynamics (the inner crowd), scientific observation (the microscope), physical sensations (yawning), and common activities (warming up, archery) to make abstract Buddhist concepts like teaching methods, *anatta*, mindfulness, and meditation practice more tangible and understandable.
