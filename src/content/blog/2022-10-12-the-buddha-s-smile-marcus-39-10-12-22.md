### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Yeah, let's do that later. Okay, so the name of the wat is, uh, Wat.

**Speaker B:** Ramphung. Sorry, Wat Ramphung. Yeah, I think it might be called, uh, Wat Ramphung Topo Ram. It's got like a full name, um, and it's very accommodating to foreigners. Uh, the monks there speak speak English, Chinese, and Thai. A lot of them seem to do.

**Speaker A:** Is that near Chiang Mai?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, it's actually very close to Wat Umong. It's just north of the airport.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and Umong is the wat that's associated with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa?

**Speaker B:** That's correct, yeah, yeah. And I've been to Wat Umong on a retreat too, and although Wat Umong's retreats are much smaller and there's much fewer people going there. The style at Wat Umong was much more laid-back and much nicer, much nicer experience, environment at Wat Umong. At Wat Rampaeng, it's quite, you know, you get a schedule that you have to follow, and it's quite busy. There's many retreatants, there's many lay people coming and going, for celebrations and for making merit and for, you know, I don't know, just visiting the temple. But I wanted to share my experience with Arahant Marampong today. So I came to the office and the monk who oversees the foreigner retreats His name was Sukkha. He was very nice, but I shared my experience, like past meditation experience with him because he wanted to know. And I said, oh, you know, I'm really looking forward to like learning the Dhamma. And he said, oh, we don't teach the Dhamma to retreatants here, we only teach the meditation practice, you know. So very Mahasi kind of Yeah, and as we talked about before, I think they have the whole idea that you start with Sati and it pulls the other things along.

**Speaker A:** It does, but it takes 20 years. Yeah, being associated with nobles pulls one along much faster.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, definitely.

**Speaker A:** But yes, it's true that if they practice only Sati, that eventually Sati will bring one to the here-now. And then the thing that's so missing in all of that is the whole point about right noble effort to make a change, to change our thoughts, change our feelings. And for some reason that's gotten missing in the Burmese method. And it seems that the Burmese method is still quite common. Not still, but I mean quite common in Thailand. It's almost like it's on the grow.

**Speaker B:** Well, also in Chiang Mai, Ajahn Tong, who I mean people might be familiar with also— I've just got to get his name now— I might have to do a quick Google search. He used to be called Noah Greenwood. Can you remember his Pali name? He's a monk in Canada. Some of the Sangha group have— oh, Yotthadhammo Bhikkhu. Yotthadhammo Bhikkhu.

**Speaker A:** Yotthadhammo, okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. He also studied at Wat Chom Thong, where I went to before, with Ajahn Thong. At Jhantong, learned Vipassana Northern Thailand style, then moved on over to Myanmar or Burma, and then came back, and then he set up, established all these retreat centers, you know. Oh, so that's why it's so common, and that's why it's so like prevalent in this area.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that makes a lot of sense that one guy goes around and sets up all of those retreat centers.

**Speaker B:** Got it. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Sounds like he cared a lot.

**Speaker B:** Well, yeah, he was good at his job. And I mean, I've seen on the Discord group as well discussions of, oh, should I trust this teacher if they don't smile, you know, if they don't show joy? And Ajahn Thong, I saw him, I'm before, um, he actually died 2 months, um, after my last retreat at Wat Chomtong. And I saw him and, you know, met him because I couldn't really— air quotes— because I can't speak or understand Thai and there was no translator around. Um, but I did ceremonies with him and such. And he, yeah, he seemed really aware, really sharp. I can't remember if he was 96 or 90. He might have been 96. Do you want me to Google it right now?

**Speaker A:** No problem. Actually, it would be better if you Googled it after we stop and put it on so that we can transfer that with this video.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but I mean, for being so old, he was really, really sharp and aware of everything that was going on. But yeah, I never saw him smile. And I'm guessing that's because you got the four on the Satipatthana— wait a second, Anapanasati Sutta, you've got the four tetrads, right? And you've got body, feelings, mind, and then Dhamma.

**Speaker A:** Let me say it, the stove and the wood is the mind, and then the smoke and the heat is the Dhamma, Dukkha, and Anicca.

**Speaker B:** Can you repeat that one more time?

**Speaker A:** In the Anapanasati, the mind would be associated with the stove and the wood, the firewood, and then the Dhamma, Dukkha, and Anicca is the heat and smoke. That is produced by the stove and the wood. Another way to talk about it is mental states, what state of mind you're in, that the kind of thoughts that you will have will greatly depend upon the state of mind that you're in. For instance, what are the kinds of things that you say when you're really angry? Are those the same kind of things that you say when you're really afraid?

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker A:** Are they quite— quite the opposite? Okay, so that's the whole point. Um, and so the, the anger would be a certain kind of wood, and the fear would be a different kind of wood, which would produce different heats and different smokes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so another way of thinking about it is, is that actually the stove is just the mind or the container, that the wood actually is the feelings. Vedana.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I can see that.

**Speaker A:** The firewood that we put in there that gives all the smoke. Okay, so that's a way of understanding it. The Satipatthana.

**Speaker B:** Oh, sorry, I mean, I guess it applies to that, but I was thinking of why these teachers who seem to be practicing for most of their lives, why they don't smile, why they don't have the joy. And we talked about with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa before, he recommended going through all four of the tetrads of Anapanasati, developing the feelings aspect of that, moving on to the mind. Yeah, yeah, where the joy comes from. And if people are— if monks, they go through life and they intentionally don't develop that but skip right on to the Tama at the end and then cut off the feelings without developing them, then yeah, they're going to be not attracted to anything really. You know, they're just going through life you know, as it is without trying to do anything else and just following the monk's rule and sustaining the body with foods. So yeah, I'm guessing that's why these teachers who have practiced a lot, why they don't smile if they follow this insight practice rather than the whole thing.

**Speaker A:** Have you ever heard of the terms dry Vipassana?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, does that fit with this?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I suppose so.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that's what the point is, is that the joy that is developed by developing the fields, the feelings, is juicy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that when people don't develop correctly, they still develop and they wind up there. In the sense of they got there with the dry method, to where Arahants that practice through the correct practice with the development of feelings, they wind up in kind of a chuckle, rather than full-on joy and gladness, that in fact, if you have overflowing buckets and buckets and buckets of joy, that too becomes ordinary, empty. All right, and so the ultimate would be, uh, that the Buddha cracks a smile.

**Speaker B:** Okay, you can't deny, you can't deny that. I mean, on all the statues, on most of the statues that you see of the Buddha, yeah, there's that little smile. And yeah, that's something that's missed, especially with the effort, the right effort that people think that they're applying in these hard-style meditation retreats. They think that's the length of the sit or the amount of sitting that they're doing, when really it's about the effort to change what's going on in the mind to make the right change.

**Speaker A:** Right. This is why the Eightfold Noble Path And the Four Noble Truths wind up as step 12 of that 16 stages of insight, rather than right off the bat. Okay, when the Buddha says he only teaches one thing, why do we have to have all of this stuff before we get to the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path? And the answer to that is step 11. That strong determination to redouble the effort. And why? Because the student has got himself into a state of fear, dread, misery, disgust, despair, and then a really strong motivation to get out of it. Followed by the redoubling of the effort, step 11, followed by now they're going to start practicing correctly with the Eightfold Noble Path with all of its pieces and parts. So with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's method is, let's see if we can start with step 11 and get the students enthusiastic about doing it without him having to trudge through all of the Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, sounds good.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's the whole thing, is let's short-circuit that thing. And that's where the joy of the teacher comes into play, because if the teacher has done the dry method, then that means that all of his students will have to work as hard and go through all of those processes and everything until the student on his own comes with the disgust and a strong desire to get out of it, followed by the redoubling of the effort.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And so every student has to figure it out on their own, and many do, and most don't.

**Speaker B:** Compliments to the abbot of Wat Rampaeng though. His name was Ajahn Supan.

**Speaker A:** Oh, okay, bell rings, ding ding ding ding, yes, okay.

**Speaker B:** He's actually very smiley, you know, laughs quite a lot when he talks with retreatants. I can tell, you know, he's coming from the right place. Yeah, so Ajahn Tong, very, very serious You know, but Ajahn Supan was really, I mean, you could see that joy.

**Speaker A:** Well, the same— Chi was his student. Sorry, what was that last?

**Speaker B:** Supan was actually Tong's student. So it was, you know, Ajahn Tong, Ajahn Supan was his student.

**Speaker A:** Okay, but Supan got the joy that his teacher Tong did not.

**Speaker B:** Did not seem to have.

**Speaker A:** Did not seem to have, right. Okay, well, an observer will see what the body is doing, which is a reflection of what's in the mind. So the mind is the forerunner for all behavior. The smile does not come from the lips by by the lips and for the lips. The smile comes out of the mind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And so we can't tell what thoughts someone has in their mind. We don't know. Some people are actually quite good at deception, so you really don't know. But you can have a good guide in the sense of their behavior. Yeah, so if somebody's agitated, you may not see their mind agitated, but you can sure see their foot wiggling.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Crossing their legs at the ankle or crossing their legs at the knee, and that foot's just shaking and shaking and shaking. Okay, and the place where that happens most often is at a hospital or doctor's office. Second most common place for it to happen is in a travel place like the railroad station, bus stops, airplane hangars, those kinds of places. It's when people get really agitated, but they don't want anybody to see how agitated they are, but it leaks out anyway.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** To those who are observing. So, back to the point about the smile, that you could also see another path other than the ones that we've been talking about, and that was going back to that cracking of the smile, is that the joy mellows out. That in fact, if you put it in the realm of the Jhanas, you could say then that the The third Jhana is the mellowed-out victory, and then the fourth Jhana is the mellowed-out joy. Okay, yeah, okay. And there, there is no more laughter. When I say no more, I'm going to say, uh, not so obvious, mellowed out, mellowed out joy. And in fact, a lot of people don't pay much attention to it, but I started paying attention to it even when Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was there in front of me. I noticed this about him, and then when they would play the tapes— because they play the tapes of Bhikkhuni even today, they'll play tapes all day long in a certain part of the walk. And you can hear that chuckle.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you can.

**Speaker A:** His voice, you can hear that chuckle in there that he's just kind of amused by everything that he says about the Dhamma. And, uh, I really enjoy that about, about him, is that even though he's not howling with laughter, it's just the howling that stopped. The laughter is still there. And yet you can see then that the Mahasi Method is the dry way of doing it, because it doesn't ever fully develop the feelings, it just squashes them. And I think that that actually is a system that was already Hindu.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I didn't really know about that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, it comes out of the ancient methods. I mean, meditation practice was really, really common. That, uh, when, when the, uh, the Buddha, before he was enlightened, when he was still a Bodhisattva, they, they knew about the Jhanas, and he practiced them with others, but it wound up not being enough.

**Speaker B:** For him.

**Speaker A:** And when he came back to realize what was going on was that one of the ways of saying it is that the students don't develop fully and stay in first Jhana, which has the rapture and the pity, this born of seclusion, which means of the hindrances, and that that was what he was missing first too. Was that everybody wants to go right through the Jhanas. The actual practice that the Buddha came across much later was, "No, we have to fully develop the first Jhana, and by doing so, we fully develop the mind and fully understand how the mind works, fully develop those feelings and understand how the feelings work." through the teaching of Paticcasamuppada. And so I would say that the dry Vipassana method has in fact predated the Buddha rather than grew up somewhere in the midst of it or was added later.

**Speaker B:** It just seems a bit strange that they said we only teach the meditation practice or meditation instructions, not the Dhamma, you know. Because— but then, I mean, there's still lots of ceremonies and ritualized stuff. I mean, lots of prostrations and lots of chanting, and— but the chanting is the Dhamma, it's right there. I mean, it's in Pali, but the translations are there, and it's in line with the teaching. But the— yeah, the The method itself, it's not really— doesn't explain it too well.

**Speaker A:** Actually, Goenka spends quite a lot of the time in his lectures in the Goenka retreat actually teaching Dhamma. The Mahasi method, I find that kind of surprising. That the monk would say that, because the students get a lot of instruction, hours and hours of that 10-day course, a couple hours a day is going to be in that instruction phase, and basically, there's not much to the method. You could fully describe the entire process in about 10 minutes. Those who understand it. It's because they don't understand it that we have to add all of this Dharma into it to give them reason, purpose, and whatnot like that to keep going. That in fact, that's one of the reasons why so many of them talk about, is this particular retreat a failure based upon the criteria of what percentage of students left early? So, if half the students leave the retreat before the retreat is finished, they would consider that a failure. But if 90% of them stay the whole course, they would consider that retreat a success. And what they're actually not doing is recognizing that the students, even though they have been told directly and easily how to practice, they don't understand it in that realm because this stuff is really profound. That's why we have to add the Dhamma in. And I bet that even though he's saying that, um, that we don't teach the Dharma, we only teach the method— can't teach.

**Speaker B:** You cut off at can't teach. Can you hear me?

**Speaker A:** Okay. Yes. What I was saying was, is that even though he says that they don't teach the Dharma, they do teach the Dhamma if the Course is successful. So I bet is what he's saying is we don't formally teach the Dharma, we teach the Dharma through teaching the method correctly. And if we only teach the method and not the Dharma, then the students will quit the course because they're not getting anything out of it. But he's not intentionally formally teaching the Dharma, but I bet he is. And so the surprise is that he'd say it that way when in fact otherwise it's the case. Other— here's the only other possibility which I think is also common, and that is, is that the people who, let us say, in that 50% that left— let's look at the 50% that stayed and why they would stay— is because what practice they're doing in their Dharma is delusional, magical, probably.

**Speaker B:** The reason why they stayed?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the reason that they stayed is because they want this magical Jhana. The reason that they stayed is because they want these magical powers. The reason that they stayed is so that they could see rebirth and check it out, make sure that it's true.

**Speaker B:** But I actually, I didn't stay the full recommended length because I've already been through it. And I went on their website and I saw a picture of Ajahn Tong, a giant picture of on their website, and I thought, oh, this again. Okay, so I'll, um, I tried to ask, can I, can I go for a few days? And like, oh no, minimum 7 days. Um, so I think I stayed like 6, 6 and a half, because I arrived on Saturday afternoon and then, and then left the following Saturday. Um, but, but yeah, I didn't feel the need to stay any longer because, um I mean, what is there to get out of it really?

**Speaker A:** Well, those are those that leave early, right? It's, "What am I doing here? What am I getting out of this?" And those who stay in those failure.

**Speaker B:** Courses— I'm getting a lot of pain from the mindful frustrations, which are extremely slow and kind of damaging my ankle. Many people talk about the pain and the And they have to constantly be moving to Anagami, otherwise the circulation cuts off in the legs and everything.

**Speaker A:** But you're talking about Westerners.

**Speaker B:** I suppose so, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Because you talked about the ceremonies and the rituals and the chanting, and I imagine that quite a number of Thai people come for those things.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And they don't have any trouble sitting on the floor.

**Speaker B:** No, no, no.

**Speaker A:** It's only the Westerners.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Why do you think that is?

**Speaker B:** We've talked about this before. I've come up with some funny things such as, oh, I'm important. I got to be high up. I got to have my chair. You know, maybe I like the Thai, how Thais like if they eat, they eat on the floor. Quite a lot on like a mat, and it feels much more communal, much more, I don't know, like a shared experience rather than an individual experience. Maybe also lowering themselves to put respected people higher, such as the teacher, or if there's a Buddha image, they don't want to be up so high, they'd rather be down low to show their respect to the Buddha.

**Speaker A:** I know about that, uh, but the point that I was making is that it's the Westerners who have so much trouble sitting on the floor. And the reason for that is because as our society goes, when a child gets old enough, like at the age of 2, they put him in a high chair.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And when we go to school, we sit in a desk in a chair. Now that's also true with, with, uh, uh, Thais. But I've watched my, uh, uh, many times that the kids are sitting on the floor when I was at school. Okay, uh, because it's part of the culture. So we can actually say that the, the body as it's growing up is affected by whether we continue to sit on the floor the way that we were flexible when we were really little, and if we continue to flex that way, that in fact most of the Thais have a way of sitting that actually has the left foot curled under the right leg and they sit kind of sideways.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And I never learned to do that. I could— I tried, but the torso, I never got to that.

**Speaker B:** I try. I'm always off at a bit of an angle, and then that's what I'm.

**Speaker A:** Getting at, is that you haven't gotten the backbone twisted well enough to be able to sit straight up the way that they can when the legs are sitting on the side like that, because they've been able to do it their whole lives.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Or even in the lotus posture. I've got a stepdaughter that I first met her when she was 11 or 12, something like that. She's about to graduate from university. So that's how many years I've been around, about 10, 12 years. And since that time, every time that I have seen her eat, which has been on kind of a regular basis from time to time, she always sits in full lotus posture. And I know that Westerners say, "Why do you do that? Why do you sit in full lotus posture?" It's comfortable. Because it's really comfortable. Yeah, it's really comfortable if you're flexible enough to sit in that posture. It is quite stable, but Westerners, we make it into a competition. Rather than being able to sit comfortably, it's how long can you endure sitting uncomfortably.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So at Wat Soan Mokkh, they have much shorter— they only have 30-minute sessions, and even then the students are recommended that if your legs are hurting to stand stand up or even walk around.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I believe— I'm sure that if there was a problem at this retreat, then they would say, yeah, you feel free to move. And because it was the same thing at Wat Chomtong, but I know the sitting would be increased up to 1 hour, walking 1 hour, sitting 1 hour. I didn't stay long enough to get to that. I got to 50 minutes. Which was still quite painful for the upper back eventually.

**Speaker A:** No, here's the point. Why do they make it a competition or a goal? Why don't we do it in the sense of sit as long as you're comfortable and tomorrow sit as long as you're comfortable and there may or may not be a time difference in there. But if you keep sitting for long times and remain comfortable, then you'll be able to sit even longer. More comfortable. But if you get in the habit of sitting uncomfortable, then even if you extend the time, you're still in discomfort.

**Speaker B:** And that's not the teaching.

**Speaker A:** And that's not the teaching. Oh no. So that's— but that's the dry method again. So the juicy method is that you have to be comfortable. That's why Anapanasati has step 4 of relaxing the body so that you can relax the feelings. Because if your body is up tight, your feelings are going to be uptight because you don't like what's happening in the body and you don't want to move because you're not supposed to move. You've got a rule in the brain about not moving. But if you have full control and you can sit as long as you please and have pleasure, then that's what we want to develop, is the pleasure.

**Speaker B:** Now, I'm not really— I'm not familiar exactly with The 16 steps of insight, like, I think you brushed up on them recently. Is that correct?

**Speaker A:** No, I just use the old brush. Okay, well, I have brushed up often, right?

**Speaker B:** I mean, the practice that I did might just fall in line with it. I haven't checked, but like, I used a lot of your kind of right speech, you know, this is a nice breath. And also, like, I mean, I know they're all from the suttas as well, like, I see you, Mara, and such. But, and the doubling down of effort that you mentioned before really does sound like when I was walking and constantly going through stuff from the past, and I stopped and I was like, okay, no, I'm gonna take the effort to look, you know, take a look at what you're doing, you know. Stop and take the effort to look at what's going on in the mind. I think I remember you saying something along those lines, and I did, because I was constantly being tricked, being pulled away from what I'm supposed to be paying attention to by the mind making up stories and or even like characters of the mind saying, hey, I've got this problem, you want to check it out? Let's walk over here and let's see what this is, you know, in the mind, and completely forgetting. And I was like, okay, now I'm going to really see what's— I'm really going to take a look at what's going on. So I made that determination, and every time it comes, you know, I see you, Mara, you know, and making the effort to change, to actually come back to stay at contact rather than— and to laugh at it, you know, to kind of laugh at what was coming up. And, you know, once you point it out, once you like laugh at it, then it has no real power to— because you're not grasping at it anymore. It's just like, "Aha, that again. All right, we'll move on back to the present moment." And when we can laugh at it.

**Speaker A:** That means we don't care so much. Yeah, I'm using the word care in the sense of Upadana.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that when we don't care, then everything is joy. Yeah. Okay. And with the dry method, the intention is that you have to catch the caring and stop it. You have to just stop. Okay, and the way of the Buddha is, no, we're not just going to stop it, we're going to actually learn to control it completely. In other words, we're going to bend it around or change it around. We're not just going to stab it in the back and leave it dead for dead, we're going to train it as a servant. And so that's the distinction between the wet and the dry, is that with the wet method, which has the full development of the mind through the full development of the first Jhana, so that when we reach the state of Upaya, it's still got that sliver of a smile left rather than deadpan.

**Speaker B:** When we get to Upekkha, there's still a smile, you said?

**Speaker A:** Yes, there's a sliver of a smile that's left. So I'm glad that we're, uh, that you're checking out all of these Watts and, uh, the Chiang Mai area.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, sure, I'm happy to check them out. I'd like to find— I'm sure Wat Umong is just perfectly fine, you know. I've got a good monk friend there who I like to visit sometimes, and he shows me around different temples around the mountains, sometimes like further out from the city. Went on a great retreat in winter, in January. That was really nice. It's very remote, very far out, and it was, I think, a temple that many— there weren't many monks there. There were a few monks there, but they were traveling, you know, and they stop off at the temple and then they leave a few days later on their travels again, you know. So hopefully can look into stuff like that again.

**Speaker A:** Actually, tudong is quite, quite, uh, let us call it, use the word popular in Thailand. Uh, the, it actually has to do with the, uh, Pansa. That Pansa is the rainy season, though the rainy season that they practice in Thailand is actually the monsoon of India, and they don't quite coincide, coincide that the monsoon, the real monsoon, is later in Thailand than it is in India. So basically, okay, about half of Pansa is during September and October because that's the time when it's really wet, and they use the same old calendar. So this is why they at Wat Amravati and what.

**Speaker B:** Um, it's in England.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, but especially in the United States at Wat Ubaya Giri they have their Ponzha during the wintertime because that would be the wintertime. Yeah, yeah. So they're, they're wise enough to make that change even though the Thai people had trouble with them moving the Ponzha into the wintertime. Uh, but back to that point is, is that that's the time when the monks are together. Let us not use the word poistered, but rather that they don't move around much. In fact, the rule is, is that once you choose wherever you start ponzha, that's your base. And then you, wherever you go, you have to get and spend only 2 nights away, and then you have to come back to that place.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I didn't know they could spend 2 nights away. Is that— is it especially 2? It's 2 nights in the— I forgot what the rules are called now. Paticcasamuppada, is it?

**Speaker A:** Sorry, what was that?

**Speaker B:** It says in the Paticcasamuppada, right, is the rules.

**Speaker A:** I forgot the— actually, the full Vinaya is the Vinaya set of rules, but it also has a huge number of stories of where the rules came from. And I think that that two-day exception is part of the Vinaya, not part of the Paticcasamuppada. The Paticcasamuppada, I don't think, has the Pancha retreats in it. Okay, but the rest of the year— the point is, the rest of the year, monks are actually expected to be out and about. That there is actually a trail system that existed and was heavily used ever before there was actually a road. Highway— I think it's A4. That comes from Bangkok all the way down into Malaysia, right? That road was even under construction, and when I was at Wat Suwan Mok, it hadn't been finished yet all the way. But the trail system that paralleled that and went through the woods was already well established. Particular campgrounds, it's almost like a national park system for monks that has been established over the centuries. Okay, and that during the year there's many, many groups of monks, especially around Pansa, because a whole lot of monks would get into a walkabout or into tudong to make it to Wat Soi Noke so that they could spend Pansa there. But after they finished Pansa, then they were back.

**Speaker B:** Just all they just, they just need the permission from the preceptor, right, to leave and stay at that temple?

**Speaker A:** For the first 5 years, okay. And after 5 years as a monk, then you're kind of on your own and you can go where you want to go. And how— intention of going and staying with other monks, not going off into the hills, or we're still going and living in a house that some layman has provided you with no monks around. That's what's frowned on. You're going to be— you need to be in a wat.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Um, and what about the Samanen? Um, they're not allowed to travel, I'm guessing?

**Speaker A:** Uh, they do travel, but in the company of senior monks, according to what Darupajaya says. And in fact, they're more than likely going to either be traveling with their Arahant or the Upaya. The Achan and the Upaya are the two main preceptors that when you have that very fancy ordination, almost all of the talking in Pali is done by the Achan, and the preceptor has a few things, basically, "Yes, I understand, let's get next." And then the preceptor himself has a whole lot to say. And the trick is that to be an Achan formally, you have to learn a whole lot of Pali. And so there was one monk in the United States who was just a star, world-class star at chanting, and he wound up doing the achan part at most of the ceremonies of people who were ordaining in the United States. They would all call for Maha Samsara to do the chanting that's done. The other part though is that if you are very serious about becoming a monk, then you will demonstrate that by learning the Pali so that you do not need to be prompted or tutored during the ceremony, that you've got your part down. Not as long as the Arahant's part, but there's quite a lot of stuff to it. A lot of it, by the way, is Achān Bhante and Nāthī Bhante, especially when they go into the part about, "Do you have tuberculosis?" Nāthī Bhante. "Do you have cholera?".

**Speaker B:** Nāthī Bhante.

**Speaker A:** And so that's the— The point is that people who are serious about doing the ordination would in fact learn that. But back to the point about the tudong. Yes, the Samanen go tudong, the achans go tudong. That's part of the path, that in fact many, many wats will have a statue of the tudong, where the monk has a bowl his umbrella, the heavy sanghati that goes over the shoulder, which is the extra heavy monk's robe. This is all camping gear. Yeah, yeah, it's all camping gear. And so he goes camping out in the woods. He's got his tent, he's got his umbrella, which makes a tent. He's got his big sanghati, which will make a hammock.

**Speaker B:** And to bring this back to the original talk, I recently got taken out by a friend to visit their hometown, which is about 2 hours north of Chiang Mai, and checked out a temple there. It was very nice. There was a cave there which connects to Chiang Rai, the same cave where that got flooded and the boys got trapped in there with the football coach, right? It actually connects through that system to that same place, but it's not in Chiang Rai, it's still in Chiang Mai region. Anyway, she said she's visited Myanmar before, Burma, and she wasn't very impressed, but in a way, by the monks, or some of the monks I should say, there. She said one of the monks that she met had been a monk in the temple his whole life since he was, I don't know, like 12 or something, and never left for his whole life, never left the temple. And he was like, I don't know, very— it was an old man They just stayed in the temple through his whole life, never venturing out again.

**Speaker A:** Which makes him pretty ignorant of the world, which is both a good thing and a bad thing.

**Speaker B:** But it's a distinction there, I mean, between— I mean, I guess the Burmese method is quite unique.

**Speaker A:** Unique, yes, and popular. As Buddhism was spreading, it looks like the Mahayana method is the main way. I'm surprised that, because students will get so much more out of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's teachings. But Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was not interested, to be honest with you, it was Ajahn Po, not Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, who was interested in Westerners. But Achan Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, his interest was to get the Thai people to wake up. And he was quite adequate at that because we have literally millions of Thai people who now really better understand the Dhamma than through the magical way that's most common.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I try to bring up Bhikkhu Buddhadasa as often as I can when I meet a Thai person Yeah, you're right, it's the older crowd that know about him. I was talking with a taxi driver yesterday and mentioned Bhikkhu Bodhisattva, he smiled, he knew about him. Yeah, practicing my Thai.

**Speaker A:** Well, I think it's that because of that sort of thing, that it's just now Bhikkhu Buddhadasa is beginning to catch on in the West. The Westerners will get much more value out of the practice if they add the parts back in that the Mahasi method has left out.

**Speaker B:** Can I ask about the retreat at Wat Suwan Mokk? I I don't know, maybe I'm just checking it out now to refresh my memory. But how tough is it there on a retreat at White Swan Mokkh? Is it a completely different thing from the Mahasi retreats, or is it similar? Very, very orderly timetable, and you have to sit this long, and Do you know about that?

**Speaker A:** Well, they do have a schedule. The last time that I was there that I had any real thing to do with the retreat was 2011, but I assumed that what they're doing then was what they're doing now. Um, actually, there, there is a kind of problem there that stems from The idea that only a monk should teach Dhamma. Probably heard that before in Thailand, that lay people don't teach Dhamma, only monks can teach Dhamma. And that mentality is in some people's minds and not others. Achan Po and Bhikkhu Buddhadasa obviously thought that how are you going to be able to train a Westerner unless you put him own in the fire. You gotta let him teach, okay? Make some mistakes and get over it and become a good teacher. So Sankhara taught many years ago, and then in 2011, Anagami Dhammavichu was teaching at these restaurants, but he now is hanging out almost exclusively with Arahant Po at Deepabhavana.

**Speaker B:** I called about a week or two ago and I asked Deepabhavana, what's it called again? Deepabhavana.

**Speaker A:** Deepabhavana.

**Speaker B:** Deepabhavana, yeah, I called, they said he's not there currently, he's at Wat Suamok, he went back, Ajahn Poh.

**Speaker A:** Ajahn Poh, yes, he goes back and forth. He is the abbot of Wat Suamok. Oh, right. Okay, he's the abbot of Wat Soan Milk, so he ought to put in an appearance from time to time. Okay, so back to the issue of the retreat. Achan Poh used to teach also the retreats along with Dhamma Vitu. When— I don't want to get into the politics, but what happens is that if you complain or make recommendations for changes to the structure of the way things are done at that retreat center, then the management will show you the door. And I can name you at least 8 people that that's happened to. And so my style there is to really get along with them. Don't make any recommendations, don't ask for anything.

**Speaker B:** I'm not sure. I mean, I was willing to check out this retreat just because I was recommended by so many friends, I wanted to investigate. But I mean, before that, I didn't really consider retreats, you know, since I've done so many and, you know, kind of got the picture in a way.

**Speaker A:** Well, Ajahn Poh and I were the ones who dreamed up the retreats doing those at Wat Suwan Moo. Back in 1983 when I was still a layman. That's when the retreats got started. I think the very first retreat was done by a monk named Brian who now lives in Singapore. But when he disrobed, there were no Western monks there until I came. And so that's when the retreats got started. So you can actually blame the retreats at Wat Silomokkhon on me because I was there very early and we did the retreats at the Boy Scout camp, which is still on the map there. And it was while I was there that Achan Po built the retreat center that has the fortifications and all of that kind of stuff. There's a lot of stories behind it. But the upshot is, is that right now I am, let us say, concerned because how good the Thai teachers are, their English is not good enough to make a really good retreat. For Westerners. Their Thai retreats are number one, first class. Okay, that in fact they've got so many retreat facilities, they've got, they've got for men and women the original 60-room places, and now they have built additional places, uh, that have 125 bedrooms each. 125 plus 125 is 250, plus 120 is 370 private rooms. Now that's a retreat center. Why would they have so many rooms? Because the Western retreats, at best, will be 120 when they're maxed out. This, the first original 60— I don't think there's ever been a Western retreat where they actually open the big dormitories, but they always use the big dormitories with the Thai retreats because the Thai retreats are much better there than the Western retreats. Partly the reason for that is because every Westerner that comes there tries to fix the place and gets shown the door. That's what happened to actually some of the monks. That's what happened to Sankhara. That's what happened to Dhammarato. It happened to Brenda. Gosh, the list just goes on and on. It happened to Wilbert. So the point there is to don't find fault with the place or you'll be asked to leave.

**Speaker B:** Paradise.

**Speaker A:** It's already paradise. Get used to it. If it's not a paradise for you, get the hell out. Um, and the reason for that is nepotism. The guy who runs the place, who's actually the nephew, the real live nephew of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, and he runs the place, and he he does it the way he wants to do it, he doesn't take any crap from anybody, because he's Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's nephew. He's older than I am now, he's in his 80s. But anyway, that's the issue with the retreat center at Wat Soen Mokkh, the International Dharma Hermitage. If you already know how to practice and you don't need any instruction, you don't need any Dharma, dog, that's a really great place to go. Another great thing to do is to go volunteer there, but that's in fact what a lot of Westerners do because Dhamma is right next door. I don't know what a door means because there's a pathway and all of that, but anyway, it's about a 10-minute walk. But from Dhamma, normally what happens is, is in order for the guys to not go out on vendabat all month long, they can take 10 days off going to Bendebat to get free food at the dining hall for the retreats.

**Speaker B:** Ah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that's where they could wind up being volunteers with the food, because, yeah, the food's easy to get. Yeah. And it's a little bit more westernized than what they find on the street.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so volunteering, volunteering there would mean what exactly? Do you know?

**Speaker A:** Hang out and enjoy your life.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, that's what I thought.

**Speaker A:** When somebody comes by that's not, mention it to them. Hey, you don't have to feel bad, you feel good instead. And so the volunteers will do things like the meetings that every student has a 15-minute meeting with teachers. Sometimes they're done in small groups of 3 or 4 or 5 people, but most of the time every student gets about 15 minutes with a teacher, and quite often those teachers are actually the volunteers that live at Don Quijote. See, I think her name is Ben. There's a Meiji named Ben that does a lot of the speaking at Sunimbo. She's very, very traditional. She's very much like Achan Ransuan, which is another Meiji that I knew there. So the instructions are given by an elderly Thai lady hasn't gotten English down pat yet, but oh, she's got a beautiful smile.

**Speaker B:** There were so many, so many meicis on my retreat at Wat Rampaeng. There's a lot, you know, and yeah, they're great, helping out with everything.

**Speaker A:** So, that about covers it. I would recommend, because Ajahn Po and Ajahn Dhammavitu both speak much better English, that the first retreat to go to would be the one at Deepabhavana, Koh Samui. That's the place to go. That's a better place for beginners. If you're an old hand at it, then Wat Soan Mook, our retreat center, the International Dharma Hermitage, is really worthwhile doing. In fact, at that time that I went there in 2011, after I'd signed up for the course and made friends with this one and that one and saw Ajahn Metteyya and also Khun Metta and whatnot, Ajahn Poh found me there because he had traveled in. He says, "What are you doing here? Why don't you come with me back over to Wat Soan Mook?" And the answer to that is, oh, well, I'm here to check out Dhammarato, that I want to hear him talk. So that's why I was able to do that retreat. Ajahn Poh didn't even want me to be there. He says, what are you doing here? You don't need to do this.

**Speaker B:** This was at Suamok?

**Speaker A:** This was at Suamok, November 2011. So any case, we've got a lot of retreat centers here. There's two retreat centers here on this island, as well as I don't even know how many retreat centers there are.

**Speaker B:** On Samui. Yeah, it was quite— during the rainy season, because it rained a lot, it was quite problematic with laundry and such. I didn't bring many clothes with me to, uh, to Rampung and ended up being very smelly wearing the same, same clothes, um, because it was just problematic, you know, the laundry. Someone left their stuff in and, uh, actually a monk left their stuff in, um, left their robes in, and, uh, I was like, should I take it out? Now I'm happy wearing the same clothes. Just I know other people aren't happy with my smell, but I'm fine.

**Speaker A:** You know, well, rainy season is not going to stop you from taking a bath and you can wash your clothes and then just wear them wet. In fact, I remember doing that specifically.

**Speaker B:** I've never done that before.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, at the Goenka retreat center, the monsoon was really, really a big deal. They even took one of the halls that they had and put little cooking pots full of coal and wood and all that kind of stuff. The room was really smoky, but at least it was warm enough to dry the clothes, because otherwise everything was wet. That even though they used this whole room for nothing but a laundry drying room, it was probably the biggest laundry, you know, they call them dryers in America. This place was a whole Buddha hall that was nothing but a dryer, and it still had moss growing up the walls. That's how bad the monsoons were there, just rained constantly. And so if that was what was happening in Chiang Mai, I can appreciate it. And so the answer to that is, he said, if you wear the clothes and think dry, the clothes will dry. If you wear the clothes wet and think wet, they'll stay wet.

**Speaker B:** I don't really understand that one.

**Speaker A:** It's got to do with your mind. Is your mind sharp?

**Speaker B:** Oh, meaning, oh, meaning, oh, do I have to feel down because my clothes are wet?

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Okay.

**Speaker A:** You're wet too. But if you could say hot dog, I can dry these clothes, but you can't. You bring your— you can bring what we in Thai we call chi wit chua, which in Chinese is chi. Yeah, in the Black communities in America we call it mojo.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Get your mojo going. So that's good.

**Speaker B:** I might have to give that a try. I've never washed clothes and then worn them wet before they dried before. Maybe a little patch of where the cloth is thick or pocket or something, but not the whole thing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Well, after they're washed, that's an easy way to dry your clothes. You put them back on What do you think the monks do? That lower cloth is called the rains cloth, and it's used as a towel, it's used as a washcloth, and when you finish with doing that, you put it back on.

**Speaker B:** And I think I'm sure some monks and practitioners would use some Tamo You know, short breathing.

**Speaker A:** Modern times have changed, but the old traditions were, hey, if you're going camping, if you're on tudong, why'd you want to carry two towels because one of them's wet? What are you going to do with a wet towel anyway? You're out walking now. Are you going to go walk around and then come back to where you were to get your dry towel? It may not be there, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so that I think the word is either sarong or lungi, depends upon what country that you're in.

**Speaker B:** Father, for the thick towel.

**Speaker A:** That they wear underneath, it's not thick, it's just a piece of cloth, the rains cloth. They use it as a towel.

**Speaker B:** I see.

**Speaker A:** And you see that actually in Not so much in the city, but out in the farms, out in the communities, you'll see both men and women with nothing on but a sarong or a lungi. The men wear them too. In fact, my landlord, I've only seen him in pants one time. The rest of the time he's wearing a lungi or a sarong. I don't know what the Thai word is. I know that sarong is the word they use in Burma. Lungi is what they use in India.

**Speaker B:** The wrong— and what, sorry?

**Speaker A:** Lungi.

**Speaker B:** Lungi.

**Speaker A:** L-U-N-G-I. And it's like a shawl that you wear from the waist down. And every monk wears them.

**Speaker B:** Pretty handy. Yeah, lots of different uses. Well, it's just a piece of cloth.

**Speaker A:** Traditional. That in fact, if you look at it, the monk's robe is nothing but camping equipment that you wear all day. Take the robe off at night, and now it's a blanket. So I really appreciate this. Why don't we finish this call now? I think that we've pretty well talked. I really appreciate you giving the information about the wat in Chiang Mai.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, if I— because it's usually when I'm talking about— when I'm talking with Thai people, they're very If they don't know me, they're very surprised when I mention like Dhamma or Buddhism, and they say, oh, you know, they usually talk about their favorite wats and stuff to me. So yeah, I'm willing to do the investigation, you know.

**Speaker A:** Great. In fact, I've got a guy named John now, I think his name's John. I'm going to send this video to him right away because he's up there in Chiang Mai right now. And I think he'd get a kick out of this.

**Speaker B:** Cool.

**Speaker A:** So anyway, Marcus, let's finish this call now and then give me a call if you got something else on your mind.

**Speaker B:** Okay, cool. Thanks. All the best.

**Speaker A:** We'll see you.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and a Sangha friend (Speaker B), the summary focuses on a critical comparison of meditation methods, centering on the experience at Wat Ramphung (Rampaeng) in Chiang Mai.

### **Core Discussion: "Dry" vs. "Juicy" Meditation Paths**

The conversation uses Speaker B's experience at a Wat Ramphung retreat as a springboard to analyze a prevalent style of meditation, often associated with the Mahasi and Ajahn Tong traditions in Northern Thailand. The key critique is that this method represents a **"dry Vipassana"** or **"hard-style"** path, which is contrasted with the **"juicy"** or complete path taught by Ajahn Buddhadasa.

**The "Dry" Path (as identified in the talk):**
*   **Focus on Technique Over Dhamma:** At Wat Ramphung, Speaker B was told they "only teach the meditation practice, not the Dhamma." The method emphasizes mindfulness (*sati*) alone, with the assumption it will eventually lead to insight.
*   **Missing Elements:** It is criticized for skipping the deliberate cultivation of **joy** (*piti*) and **gladness** (*sukha*) found in the early stages of *Anapanasati* (mindfulness of breathing). It also neglects the active role of **Right Effort**—the effort to skillfully change unwholesome states of mind.
*   **Resultant Demeanor:** Practitioners and teachers of this method are often seen as serious, unsmiling, and lacking visible joy. The path is seen as moving directly to equanimity (*upekkha*) by suppressing feelings rather than fully understanding and transforming them through the complete path.
*   **Physical Discomfort:** The method is associated with rigid schedules, long sitting periods, and enduring pain, which is seen as counterproductive.

**The "Juicy" or Complete Path (as advocated by Dhammarato/Ajahn Buddhadasa):**
*   **Integrated Development:** The full practice, as outlined in the *Anapanasati Sutta*, systematically develops the mind through the four tetrads (body, feelings, mind, and mental qualities/Dhamma). It intentionally cultivates joy and happiness as a foundation.
*   **Right Effort is Central:** The practice emphasizes actively applying the mind to abandon unwholesome states and cultivate wholesome ones, not just passive observation.
*   **Joyful Result:** A correctly developed practice leads to a mind full of joy and gladness, which eventually mellows into a serene, smiling equanimity—like the "sliver of a smile" seen in Buddha statues and heard in Ajahn Buddhadasa's voice.
*   **Comfort is Key:** Meditation should be done comfortably. Discomfort is not an endurance test but a signal to adjust. The goal is to sit with pleasure to deepen concentration and understanding.

### **Supporting Topics & Anecdotes:**

1.  **Teacher Examples:** The talk contrasts the serious demeanor of **Ajahn Tong** (a prominent teacher of this dry method) with the smiley and joyful **Ajahn Supan** (his student), and the ever-chuckling **Ajahn Buddhadasa**.
2.  **Historical Context:** Dhammarato suggests the "dry" method may predate the Buddha, resembling older Hindu ascetic practices that the Buddha found insufficient before his enlightenment.
3.  **Structural Critique:** The 10-day retreat model is questioned. The high dropout rate is seen not just as a failure of willpower but often as a rational response to a method that withholds the inspiring joy of the Dhamma.
4.  **Cultural & Practical Notes:**
    *   The difficulty Westerners have sitting on the floor is linked to cultural habits, not the practice itself.
    *   The tradition of monks going on *tudong* (wandering) is discussed as an important part of monastic training in Thailand, unlike the more sedentary practice observed in some Burmese contexts.
    *   Recommendations are given for retreat centers: **Deepabhavana** on Koh Samui (with Ajahn Poh) is best for beginners, while the **International Dharma Hermitage** at Wat Suan Mokkh is good for experienced practitioners who don't need much instruction.

### **Conclusion:**

The talk is a passionate advocacy for a holistic, joyful, and intellectually engaged path to Dhamma practice. It warns against reductionist methods that focus solely on rigorous technique and endurance, arguing that they miss the heart of the Buddha's teaching: the transformative development of the entire mind, leading to genuine happiness and liberation.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors** and reference a few **stories** to explain their points about meditation practice and Buddhist teachings.

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The Stove, Wood, Heat, and Smoke:** This is the central metaphor used to explain the relationship between mind, feelings, and mental phenomena (Dhamma).
    *   **The Stove:** Represents the mind or the container.
    *   **The Wood:** Represents feelings (*vedana*) or mental states (e.g., anger, fear).
    *   **The Heat and Smoke:** Represent the resulting mental phenomena—suffering (*dukkha*), impermanence (*anicca*), and the general quality of experience produced. Different "wood" (feelings) creates different "smoke and heat" (thoughts and outcomes).

2.  **Dry vs. Juicy/Wet Method:** This metaphor contrasts two approaches to meditation.
    *   **Dry Vipassana:** Describes a strict, effortful practice (like the Mahasi method discussed) that focuses on insight (*vipassana*) without fully cultivating positive mental states like joy. It's seen as austere, potentially leading to a serious, joyless demeanor.
    *   **Juicy/Wet Method:** Describes a practice that intentionally develops joy, tranquility, and positive feelings (like in the *jhanas*) as part of the path. This leads to a more joyful, smiling disposition, as exemplified by the Buddha's statues.

3.  **Overflowing Buckets of Joy:** Used to describe how even abundant joy, if not understood, can become "ordinary" and empty. The ultimate state is more subtle—a "mellowed-out joy" or a "sliver of a smile" (like the Buddha's), not constant exuberance.

4.  **Camping Gear:** The monk's robes and possessions are described as multipurpose camping equipment for the itinerant (*tudong*) life: the robe becomes a blanket, the lower cloth a towel, the umbrella a tent. This metaphor highlights the simplicity and practicality of monastic life.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The 16 Stages of Insight (Visuddhimagga):** Speaker A references this framework to explain a pedagogical shortcut. The story is that practitioners often trudge through stages of misery and disgust (Stage 10) before developing a strong determination to change (Stage 11). Only then do they practice the Eightfold Path correctly (Stage 12). The point is that a good teacher (like Buddhadasa) tries to help students start with that strong, joyful determination (Stage 11) from the beginning, skipping the unnecessary suffering.

2.  **The Buddha's Smile:** The common depiction of the Buddha with a gentle smile is used as a story and evidence. It's contrasted with the serious, unsmiling demeanor of some meditation masters (like Ajahn Tong). The argument is that the Buddha's smile reflects the "juicy" path that includes the cultivation of joy, not its suppression.

3.  **Anecdote about Ajahn Tong and Ajahn Supan:** A brief story contrasts two teachers. Ajahn Tong, a serious proponent of the "dry" method, rarely smiled. His student, Ajahn Supan (the abbot of Wat Ramphaeng), however, was very smiley and joyful. This personal observation is used to support the idea that the "dry" method is a choice, not an inevitable outcome, and that the "juicy" qualities can be developed and passed on.

4.  **Anecdote about the Trapped Monk in Myanmar:** Speaker B shares a story from a friend about a Burmese monk who had lived his entire life inside one temple, never venturing out. This is used to highlight a cultural distinction and to suggest that the isolated, strict Burmese method can lead to a different kind of life compared to the more itinerant (*tudong*) tradition common in Thailand.

5.  **Personal Retreat Anecdotes:** Both speakers share personal stories from retreats (e.g., at Wat Ramphaeng, Wat Suan Mokkh) to illustrate the differences in teaching styles, schedules, and physical discomfort between "dry" and "juicy" approaches. These stories ground the theoretical discussion in lived experience.

**In summary,** the conversation uses the **metaphors of the stove/wood/fire** and **dry vs. juicy practice** to frame a critique of certain modern meditation techniques. It supports this critique with **stories** about the Buddha's smile, the progression of insight, and personal experiences with teachers, arguing for a more holistic, joyful path that integrates calm (*samatha*) and insight (*vipassana*).
