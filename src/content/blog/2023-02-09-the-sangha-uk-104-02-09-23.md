### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Job makes it hard to be consistently happy or be more often happy than not. So it may be a good decision to move from that perspective as well, because if you move to something that will be a little bit lower difficulty level, then you can get happy while doing that thing and get really good at that, you know. So the external can influence the internal. As much as the internal can influence the external, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's a two-way street. Yeah. But ultimately, they're not separate or they're not distinct from one another. So I would say that the external is kind of like an illusion to the extent that everything you experience subjectively not to get into any ontological debates about the truth of material reality or not. But if you get your subjective experience in order, in other words, if you become satisfied, if you get into a wholesome state, if you get your mojo back, you feel good about yourself, you hype yourself up within your own mind. And you feel invincible, unstoppable, like irrespective of any situation. Yeah, it doesn't matter what job you have, like, like you're just a force of nature and like, you can't be stopped. Like, nothing can fuck with your happiness. So like, that's what you— that's the priority. Once you do that, then you can make clear decisions on, oh yeah, You know what I do? Like, things will like naturally get better because I see, oh yeah, I know what this job isn't right for me. I'll make a different decision, figure something out. But you're not doing that out of desperation or out of panic or out of anxiety. So like what I'm saying is like, make a priority on getting your mojo going in that, and then maybe everything starts working out at work and maybe you're like, So like, I'm not saying to do any one thing. I'm just saying, except for getting yourself into a wholesome state, that's all I'm recommending. But maybe things start working out at work, and maybe you like— maybe you're like, actually, this isn't bad, and actually, I can handle this. So, so yeah, like, that's the way to go about things.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. That's really good. That's solid.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, don't let anything be a justification to make you worried or unsatisfied.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** That's the rule. Hey, Alex, welcome. And welcome, Marcel. Good to see you, man.

**Speaker A:** Good to see you too. Let me get on here. It's not doing videos. There we go. How are you guys?

**Speaker B:** Good. We're just talking about how your priority above all other decision-making or all other planning should be getting yourself in a wholesome state of mind. So if you get yourself feeling good, irrespective of the situation, then we can deal with the situation more intelligently. More efficiently and with more wisdom. So whatever it is, whatever situation, your job or whatnot you're trying to do, any decision about that that comes from a hindrance— panic, anxiety, worry, fear— is probably not the best decision to make. But any decision, on the other hand, that comes from a feeling of clarity and confidence, is probably going to lead to karmically better results. And this is the only advice that I can give you. Like this. So I actually have a sutta today that's kind of relevant to this topic called One Fortunate Attachment. Perfect. If there's any other questions or things people want to riff off what we've been talking about so far, please feel free to jump in. Any comments, any things that you guys want to talk about? All right, so I'll just take that as my cue to start the sutta. Oh, another thing that you missed, Alex, is I was talking to the other Alex. There's two Alexes here. So me and Alex were talking about snowboarding. And, you know, Dhammarato talks about getting your mojo going sometimes. And the first way I learned what he really meant was what it feels like to go.


### Summary

Based on the provided transcript, here is a summary of the Dhamma talk's core teaching:

The central theme is that **the highest priority in any life situation is to first cultivate a wholesome, happy, and confident state of mind ("get your mojo back").**

The discussion, led by **Speaker B (likely Dhammarato)**, unfolds in two key parts:

1.  **The Two-Way Street:** Initially, a friend (Speaker A) suggests that changing an external situation (like a difficult job) can improve internal happiness. Speaker B agrees this is a valid "two-way street," but then emphasizes that the **internal state is the primary point of leverage.**

2.  **The Primacy of Internal Work:** The main teaching is that if you first develop an unshakable, satisfied, and "invincible" subjective state—where "nothing can fuck with your happiness"—then you can deal with external situations with clarity and wisdom. From this place of strength:
    *   You might find you can handle your current job.
    *   You might clearly see it's not right and make a calm, intelligent change.
    *   **Crucially, you avoid making decisions from desperation, panic, or anxiety, which lead to poor karmic results.**

**The Rule:** "Don't let anything be a justification to make you worried or unsatisfied." All planning and decision-making should flow from a foundation of inner well-being.

**Context for the Broader Talk:** The speaker mentions this leads into a relevant sutta ("One Fortunate Attachment") and notes that the concept of "getting your mojo going" was personally understood through the feeling of flow in an activity like snowboarding—a metaphor for that energized, confident, and unimpeded state of mind.

**In essence:** Don't let external conditions dictate your happiness. Master your inner state first, and from that place of power and clarity, right action and right decisions will naturally follow.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, the primary **metaphor** and **story** used are:

**1. The "Mojo" Metaphor:** This is the central, recurring metaphor. "Mojo" is used as a metaphor for one's internal state of power, confidence, and well-being. It represents an intrinsic energy or vibe that makes a person feel "invincible, unstoppable... like a force of nature." The speaker advises prioritizing "getting your mojo back" or "getting your mojo going" as the foundation for all other decisions.

**2. The "Two-Way Street" Metaphor:** Speaker A introduces the idea that "the external can influence the internal. As much as the internal can influence the external." Speaker B agrees and labels this a **"two-way street,"** a common metaphor for reciprocal interaction and mutual influence.

**3. The "External as Illusion" Metaphor/Concept:** While carefully avoiding a deep philosophical debate, Speaker B suggests that the external situation (like a bad job) is **"kind of like an illusion"** relative to one's subjective experience. The point is that one's *perception* and internal state color the external reality, making the internal work paramount.

**4. The "Force of Nature" Story/Metaphor:** Speaker B paints a vivid, almost superhero-like, story of an ideal internal state: feeling like an unstoppable "force of nature" where "nothing can fuck with your happiness." This is a narrative image of what it means to have one's "mojo" fully activated.

**5. The Implied "Clear vs. Cloudy Decision-Making" Story:** The talk contrasts two narratives:
    *   The **story of desperate action**: Making a job change "out of desperation or out of panic or out of anxiety," which implies poor, reactive decisions.
    *   The **story of empowered action**: First attaining a "wholesome state," then making decisions "from a feeling of clarity and confidence," which leads to "karmically better results." This is the preferred narrative arc.

**6. The "Snowboarding" Anecdote (Mentioned at the end):** Speaker B briefly mentions a conversation about **snowboarding** as a personal story that helped him understand what "getting your mojo going" physically feels like. It serves as a concrete, experiential example of the abstract concept being discussed.

**Summary:** The talk uses the **"mojo" metaphor** as its core, supported by the **"two-way street"** and **"illusion"** metaphors. It tells a **contrasting story** of reactive vs. empowered action, culminating in the ideal **"force of nature"** self-image. The personal **snowboarding anecdote** grounds the abstract advice in a real-world, bodily experience.
