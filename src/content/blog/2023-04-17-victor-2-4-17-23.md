### Transcript


**Speaker A:** And when the recording starts, repeat that. Uh, it hasn't started there. There we go. Okay, Victor, you were here a couple of 3 months ago, and you were saying that when you first started practicing, you experienced an awful lot of anxiety.

**Speaker B:** Yes, um, it was always part of my life, and I just saw that life just had to have anxiety. It was something like genetics and just my behavior. And in our first call, you're talking about Anagami, the mind, having a more carefree approach towards life. But during panic attacks and anxiety, that's very hard to do. So I couldn't just fathom like how one could even start doing it because I'm like, oh, it's not happening to me. So then I started practicing. I actually went to a retreat, and my practice, formal practice, started picking up. And suddenly I just have my mind just much clearer. And now I'm like, okay, I can now try to actually start contemplating those concepts, because it even felt like a superpower. I'm like, wow. And before, I thought anxiety was helping me be more productive. Then you realize how counterproductive anxiety really is, you know, it's just because it just fucks the mind and you just can't do anything. So I'm in a much better phase now. And so now I wanted to actually talk a bit more about the Supramundane Dharma and like the concepts and try to internalize them a bit better. I think now I'm just— I have a stronger foundation to work with.

**Speaker A:** Okay. All right, well, it's kind of— let us just talk about it like this. The anxiety that is there, normally when people start practicing Anapanasati, they run into a wall of anxiety. But basically, the wall was always there. The anxiety was already there, and that we were living our lives according to it. But ignorant of it.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** Um, it— here, let us do it this way. A simple little thing. Imagine that you've got Grandma's car, and Grandma goes to shopping, and she goes here and there and other places in her car. And then, um, uh, the teenage, um, or perhaps no, a professional race car driver, somebody who really knows. He gets in that car and drives it around the block and comes back with a whole long list of things that are wrong with it, right? All he had to do was to drive it, and he can feel that the suspension on the left front needs to be fixed and that kind of thing. All right, so, um, basically what we're talking about is that knowledge By investigation, by looking, is the right way to go. And you're saying that now that you've gotten the mind settled down, you're wanting to contemplate things? Is that the word that you used?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I wanted to get specifically into the gladdening of the mind concept because that's still a bit abstract to me, you know, people say, "Oh, you need to gladden the mind." I'm like, "How do I?" You know, like you just, I'm not sure if it's like a feeling or if it's just like trying to be glad about things that I have in life, but then I'm afraid of running into like attachment and just conditioning my happiness to things that happen.

**Speaker A:** All right. Well, let's go down that road just a little bit. The gladdening of the mind, those words actually is pointing pointing at something, and that it's actually in a section that is talking about the states of mind. And this is where information from other suttas can also come in and help, especially the Satipatthana Sutta, when it talks about noticing the state of mind that we're in. Is the mind dull? Is it sharp? Is it deluded? Is it greedy? In other words, when it's affected by hindrances, it is in a different state than when it's not affected by hindrances. And so the gladdening of the mind actually is not just words that we use, it's to change the state of mind that we're in. Okay, an example of that would be some, maybe an old person, or maybe you pulled a late night or something like that. And so getting up or waking up in the morning, and the thoughts of tiredness, the thoughts of, oh no, etc., like that happen. But then some thought occurs and we actually are able to get up. Now that new thought means a new state of mind, because the state of mind that we were in, we couldn't get— you couldn't even get out of the bed. I feel bad. Okay. And so we can in fact change the state of mind that we're in. This is just another example of it. You're tooling down the road having a conversation, and all of a sudden you see the blue and red lights and you hear the wow, and your state of mind changes immediately. Okay, so the change of mind, the state of mind affects the thoughts and the thoughts affect the state of mind. And so by using gladdening thoughts, we can in fact change the state of mind that we're in. And by changing the state of mind that we're in, we can also then affect the way that we feel, that these things are all integrated together. And by experimenting with it, you begin to see how one affects the other, that in fact if you can't fix this, you can at least fix that, which will help fix this. So once we get the mind cleaned out, the only thing to do is to keep cleaning it out. That's where the insight comes. The insight comes from the inspection, continuing inspection. Is this thought worth having? Is that thought worth having? And that basically what you're asking is, what comes next? All right, what comes next actually is now a dissatisfying thought. When we have this is good enough, now we're in satisfaction. But once we get into that satisfaction, it's very Western of you just to start asking, well, what's next, especially since we have an idea of what's next. All right, and that in fact, within our conceptualized world, we think that what we need to do then is contemplate. And in fact, that's what Christian meditation is really all about, is contemplation. All right, or another way of saying it is living in concepts. Connecting this concept to that concept, putting a bigger story together, etc., like that. And that here we're not interested in concepts or conceptualizing, or of, let us say, like Anicca, conceptualizing Anicca. That's not what we're doing here. We're investigating Anicca, not contemplating it. This is not a contemplation exercise. This is an observational exercise. And that in that particular moment, what needed to be observed was this thought: what's next? That's what we should have seen, is that thought too is unwholesome. Out it goes. I'm having too much fun right now. To want to go, um, uh, let us say, uh, make up stories about things that I thought that I had already seen before and figured out. Okay, because that's going back into the conceptualization, or back into, uh, the thought process that we were intending to clear out in the first place. But congratulations, that's what everybody does. Everybody gets a little bit of progress, and then instead of continuing doing that, they want to say, well, I got that now, what's next?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, what question that I have is that, like, how does that So sometimes, how do I enjoy practice but at the same time just maintain a hatefulness on whether I'm on the right track or whether I'm actually practicing concentration or if I'm just letting myself get carried away? So that's usually what I have some trouble with.

**Speaker A:** In a most profound way, concentration, or other words like absorption, is exactly being carried away. That the Buddha did not teach concentration— nowhere in it is there any concentration. But Western Buddhism has stumbled across this word concentration because of a bad translation. And let me go into this a little bit because this is an important point.

**Speaker B:** Point.

**Speaker A:** The actual word from the Pali is the word Samatha. It's probably one of the— when people learn 10 or 12 Pali words, Samatha is going to be one of them, along with Nibbana. Okay, and the Samatha and Nibbana are both wrongly translated. Did that— Bhikkhu Buddhadasa has a little book called Nibbana for Everyone. And the example that I would use for that is that your average late middle-aged factory worker comes home in the snow with his big heavy jacket on, walking a couple of blocks after he got off of the subway or something. He trudges into the house, he puts that big overcoat on the hanger, and he sits down in his easy chair, and for a couple of three seconds he actually has Nibbana. Nothing is going on. He takes a rest. It just doesn't last very long, but everybody has little Nibbana. Everybody has little nothingnesses. We need to recognize those and see them when they occur and being able to duplicate the natural ones. All right, the same thing is even more true about the word Samadhi, in the sense that it's been wrongly translated. You see words like absorption and concentration and other things like that that indicate that the person gets lost. In it. So the example that I would use is years ago they used to have whack-a-mole machines in the corridors of the grocery stores for the kids to play, and it's a matrix of 16 by 16 holes that things pop up, dildos or something pop up out, and the job is to hit each one of them as it comes. Now, a little child can actually go to concentrate on one. Let us say the lower left-hand corner. If that mole comes up, we're going to get it, but we may miss all the others. But we'll at least get this one because we're concentrating on this one. All right. Or let us say somebody who really is pretty good at whack-a-mole, he's standing there getting them all, and his girlfriend can come straight, come right up behind him, and he doesn't even know she's there. Because he's concentrating on the whack-a-mole, right? This is the down issue of concentration. We're not intending to try concentration at all. In fact, what we normally do is we concentrate on things when we should be paying attention to other things. An example of that is that the teacher stops the lecture and looks in the back of the room and says, "Johnny, pay attention." because Johnny is daydreaming. She says, stop daydreaming, stop looking out the window. In the old days, schools all had a whole bunch of windows. Now I don't think they have windows anymore because they don't want kids looking out the window. They want them to pay attention, right? They want them to concentrate. Exactly. All right, so this whole quality of concentration then has an extra problem to it. Because whatever we're concentrating on means that that's the only thing that we're getting and we're missing everything else. And it's a big wide wonderful world out there. All right. And so you've also heard the concept of taking an object of meditation or taking a focal object, even say a meditation object or a concentration object. Right. We're learning to do that, but not by going deeper and deeper and deeper into one object like a casino meditation, a fire meditation or something, but rather we're learning how to control the mind, manipulate the mind by moving it around and stop getting lost in something, stop getting, how to say, enamored with something. So, um, here's, here's two examples. The kid who was, uh, let us say 7 or 8 years old, his dad has told him, you can't play on the computer, it's time for you to go to sleep. And so here the kid is with his computer on, the lights are on, he's not in bed, and he hears his dad coming down the hall. And as he hears his dad coming down the hall, flick the switch, turn the monitor off, jump into bed just as the dad's coming into the room, right? Okay, now let's fast forward it a few years. The kid's a little older now. He's sitting in front of the computer screen, uh, writing code. His dad comes down the hall. His dad opens the door. The dad says, "Good night, son," and the kid doesn't lift his head from the computer. He's still writing his code. His dad gets pissed off, storms out of the room. "You don't love me anymore," right? Okay, so in that regard, concentrating is not all that great. We need to pay attention. Dad might be coming down the hall any second now. All right, let's be open. Let's start listening. Let's start being in our senses rather than being in our head. Okay, so the first example, the kid was actually listening. He knew that he could get into trouble, and so he is paying attention to what's going on. Later, he's lost in his code, he's lost in thought, he's concentrating on it, and that's causing trouble. So when you understand it like that, let's go one step further into that. The Zen stick— do you know about the Zen stick? You've heard about Zen masters and Zen sticks, right? Basically, the Zen stick is about a 2-foot or 3-foot long piece of bamboo that's been split and slit down the middle so that at the end of the stick there's a small little gap And that gap compresses air, so when someone is hit, it sounds ferocious, but it's the stick making its own sound, not the shoulder getting broken. Okay, who is— who is it that gets hit with the Zen stick? If you were the Zen master and you were walking around, who would you hit with that stick? Did you freeze, or are you just thinking? Okay, no, you froze. All right, so if you were the Zen master, who would you hit with that stick?

**Speaker B:** The person falling asleep.

**Speaker A:** All right, that's one of them. Let us say we can do the general collection in the sense of anybody who does not know that the Zen master is right behind them. Gets hit with the stick, whether he is in what he would call deep meditation, or whether he is concentrating, or whether he's drowsy, or whether he's asleep, or any of those kind of things. And the whole point of the Zen stick is to wakey-wakey. This is what Sati is really all about, is to remember to come out of the mind into the reality of our senses over and over and over again. And so this is what Anapanasati then is, to be mindful of the breathing because the breathing is done in a reality. Breathing is real. Okay, so paying attention to the breathing means that we're actually developing Sati on the in-breath and Sati on the out-breath so that we can remember to take a long deep in-breath and take a long deep out-breath. And that means then that the rest of the in-breath, the mind can wander away. And then the rest of the out-breath, the mind can wander away. But if it's not, let us say, a breath with Sati, of a long deep breath, then the mind just wanders and wanders and wanders while the breathing is not being watched. But if we're watching and remembering to take each breath a long deep breath, That means that the mind cannot wander very far. And another way of looking at it is that you cannot even control your breath to make it a long deep breath unless you're already controlling the mind. The mind is controlling the breath, and so by you intentionally controlling the breath, you're already syncing the mind and the body together as one. Into unification.

**Speaker B:** One question that I have is that when I close my eyes, it's like I'm entering a war zone and I can suddenly be very aware of my mind just going all over the place. And I tried to start with a breath and sometimes like I'm aware that I'm meditating, so I have some Sati, but I can't just follow the breath. Breath properly. I'm not sure what exactly it's— I hear your language.

**Speaker A:** War zone. Okay, I hear your language that this is hard to do, right? That you have to work hard at it. These are hindering words. These kind of thoughts hinder you from making progress. Oh, this is hard is the kind of language that a victim would use. A war zone is the kind of language that a victim would you. So changing your language is, oh, we've got a very interesting playground, not a war zone. Okay, the mind is a wonderful playground to experience, to enjoy, to investigate safely.

**Speaker B:** Got it.

**Speaker A:** So you're actually intending, or, uh, going into the point about that there is a lack of safety somewhere in there. Calling it a war zone means that you don't feel safe.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And using words like war zone, of course you're not going to feel safe.

**Speaker B:** I, I, I think it's just that having experienced a, a moment of a week of peacefulness and not so much suffering. I think one of the reasons why I'm not feeling safe is that I'm afraid that I'm going to lose the way or I'm going to go back to just the suffering. So I'm like, I need to guarantee that I can. So yeah, in a way it's like me trying to control my practice and just make 100% sure that— I know.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Right. So that making sure, that redoubling, etc., like that, that's again pointing out and showing that you're coming from the victim's position, that anything can go wrong, right? It's almost like— imagine this, you've seen people do, uh, build house of cards. You know, they bend the card in a certain way so it gets a kind of stiffness, and then it'll hold a little bit of structure, but eventually it falls apart. Yeah, no card house stays that way. In fact, they're really hard to construct and easy to break, but it's fun to do it when you know that it's going to fall apart. You see, what you're doing is you made your own card house as if it were important, and you're afraid that it'll fall apart. And all, if my card house falls apart, I've got to go build it again. No, you don't. You're building in the first time because you were having fun at it. So this is the whole point, is, is that our human our Western society has made everything important, has work to do, and we've taken all the childhood fun out of life. Put the fun back into it by seeing everything as a new toy to play with, including anxiety, including the wandering mind. This is just a toy to play with, and by doing that, by changing that, we're actually changing our attitude from being a loser who has very important, difficult work to do, and anything can fall apart, into a child that's just messing around, having fun, with nothing is important.

**Speaker B:** Okay, that was clear enough. I'm laughing because it's like, this is relatable, you know, the way you're talking about like building up like a house of cards, but it's It's kind of like what I'm trying to do. It's like, oh, I need a guarantee that like the practice is gonna stay this way, but it's like an unsustainable thought, I guess.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. And also you were going in that same direction when you were talking about contemplation, that that's just more card building. All right. And so we can begin to recognize that we've got a choice about how we feel. We've got a choice about being either the victim or being the winner, being successful, that we're working on changing the language that we have to feel safe and secure and successful. And we need to practice that over and over again. And when we get good at that, keep doing it.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Um, yeah, I thought it was like— oh, go ahead.

**Speaker A:** The teaching of the Buddha is very, very simple. There's just not much to it. We just need to just keep cleaning, keep cleaning, keep this thought, this thought, this thought. Um, that in fact, if I use an example of cleaning your bedroom until the whole room is empty, also has a misunderstanding because it looks like that it's a job that needs time to do. No, it does not need any time to do it. Everything is done right now. So it's not a matter of the whole house of cards that we're building, it's this card. Can we put this card in the house without it falling down. Just this one, one moment, one thought at a time. This is how we're working, rather than looking at it from the long direction, which a lot of people do. I mean, there are the stories that people say, well, I put in 10,000 hours of meditation and look what a good teacher I am now. And another one says, oh, I put in 100,000 hours meditation and I'm still waiting for the bliss to come, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I thought that like just enjoying the practice would mean slacking off, but with what you're saying, I can get it. It's just like accept the challenge. It's not like just slacking off, it's just accepting the challenge and actually just taking joy in the practice. So.

**Speaker A:** That you in fact can do this and it's fun and easy to do. One more time, okay? And then we can say that we put the toys away and have to deal with the adults in the room, and we go back into bad feelings. Because they see everything is important. But put that card deck away. You clean your room. You do what you're told to do. Okay. And so everything winds up being important. But here we can look at, oh no, we're going to actually find out what is important, what is actually important. Is— well, let's put it this way: if you were dead, what would be important.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** Once you're dead, things don't matter anymore, okay? Make— making a will is something that a man alive does. The dead man don't think about wills, okay? So here's the point: being alive then is kind of important, because only when you're alive can anything be important. So the only important thing is being alive. And the next part of that means is that the only thing that's going to keep you alive is this next breath. You've got a death sentence. You're going to die within 3 minutes. But you can get a reprieve. You can take the next breath. You can stay alive. If we put that understanding into our practice, that it's actually important for us to take this next breath, and that's the only thing that is important, is being alive. And the next point is, is that yeah, so many people are alive out there and they're not enjoying it, that it's almost like that car that they want to buy is more important than being alive. So the next point is, is that, well, so what's about being alive if you're not even there for it? So being alive and knowing that you're alive and experience being alive and experiencing the body right here, right now, that's the only thing that's important, is being alive and experience being alive. And yet our society has showed us 10,000 things that are more important than just being alive. 10,000 things are important, you know. That car is important, the house is important, paying the bills is important, taking the dog to the vet's important. Just over and over and over again, all of this important stuff. And we become victimized by all the things that are important. But wisdom shows none of those things are important. What's important is enjoying this next breath.

**Speaker B:** I'm dumbfounded with how people just, you know, the more I just, I can see things more clearly, especially when you can get a calm mind. It's just very perplexing how the whole of society can just be going like in another direction and just rather doing some things that just did not really bring proper happiness. In our first call, you mentioned something along those lines, you know, just enjoying life and people just, they just put on like a hard face and just a self-flagellating attitude. And then at the time I wasn't really buying it, like just properly buying it. But now I'm like, every day I question myself, like how can there be so much just self-inflicted suffering, especially like I see at work, people just think that 'Oh, I need to just work more. I need to be like a hard worker.' And they just don't even know exactly.

**Speaker A:** What they're doing that for.

**Speaker B:** So it's very— that part is becoming very clear to me, like that enjoying life is simpler than it sounds. But it's just sometimes it's so hard that just— there are a lot of people going against what you're doing. So like, you just— your social reptilian brain is kind of just asking itself, oh, shouldn't I just— so many people are doing something, so shouldn't you also do that? So you kind of start questioning this attitude of just let's enjoy life, because you're like, oh, nobody's enjoying their life, so there must be something wrong with my theory here. So, um, so maybe it's just overcoming this voice that's supposedly rational, but doesn't really help us just get better, like, in the long run.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, you kind of mentioned the idea of, how am I doing, Daddy? How am I doing? Okay, what that means is that the child is kind of comparing himself to the rules that we've set up, how things are supposed to be. Then in fact, you've probably heard about within Buddhism that there is a big fetter that is called personality view. And then the second fetter is Sila, Bhante, Paramita, the rights, rules, and rituals. Okay, so these two fetters work very, very closely together, just as how am I doing, Daddy? That's the child, the person, the personality, asking that second fetter, how am I doing? All right, so here we can say then that here is personality. A very good definition of personality is all of the rules, all the rights, all the supposed-tos, coupled with how each individual reacts to them. So everybody has their own set of internal rules and they also have their own internal reaction to those rules. And we make those rules kind of important because, I mean, they're— we've been told, we've been taught, we've been beaten, we've been belted, we've been slapped, we've been hit, we've been punished 10,000 ways to try to prove to us that rules are important. All right. Well, guess what? Now the rules have defined who we are, that when we present ourselves to the world, we don't present ourselves the raw me. We present ourselves according to a set of standards, a set of rules, a set of the way that I'm supposed to present myself. And everybody does that, okay? So whenever we address someone and we talk to them, we actually are not addressing them, actually the real owner deep down inside of that person. We are in fact addressing our own ideas of who they thought that they wanted to present to us. So in fact, when you're talking to somebody, you're just talking to that person as if they were in your own head. The real person is different. Now that could be used as a great advantage, because when Granny is fussing at us, she's only fussing at her own idea. She's not fussing at the real you, that you're something different, that what she's fussing at is what you presented to her, not the real you. And you accepted in the real you is the one who feels bad when she's fussing, and she's only fussing about the rules, and she only knows you, and you only know you because of the rules, but the one who feels bad is the little kid inside. So we need to work with these two things to recognize that we need to stop abiding by a set of rules about how things are supposed to be and start living more of a child's life of investigating the realities of the moments, to become intimate rather than obnoxious, to really get involved in the sense of knowing, of seeing, of doing. So we can take that whole idea deeper, but one of the things that we can, at least in this talk, do and then go to the deeper stuff later, is to recognize that you have a choice in every moment. When someone is criticizing, they don't necessarily have the ability to criticize you. They're criticizing their idea of you, which is probably wrong. In other words, the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune will almost always miss the target. But we've got to stand up and become the target, and then we can get hit. That we actually do that, we actually, instead of just letting the slings and arrows of outrage— well, that was nice, that's interesting, go right by— we just stand up and say, that's me, and then get hit with that arrow.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** We get in our own way because why? Because we have decided that we are indeed who all of our rules, all of our supposed-tos are. But when we begin to recognize, no, you are not your set of rules, you are not stuck, that you can change. The Buddha's model is a definite change model. And when do we change? Right there with that right effort, the right noble effort to get the heck out of the way of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, whether they're coming out of Granny's mouth or whether we dreamed them up.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah, that's a great metaphor, actually. Do you intend on elaborating on that, or am I supposed to?

**Speaker A:** Um, yes. Well, here's a way of looking at it, then. I will go a little bit deeper since you've asked. We actually— this is actually in the US. This is legal code in the United States. I learned about this stuff from a high class lawyer in Washington, D.C., okay? And it had to do with the coal mining industry, but it has ramifications everywhere. And the three items are the owner, the controller, and the agent. Now, these in legal sense are real people. Normally in— this is because of the Land Reclamation Act where they wanted the people to plant trees over the bad coal mines., right? But, uh, and that the, the rule was is that you can't get a new permit until you clean up the old mine, reconstitute, reclaim the land. Okay, so who's going to do that? Who's going to do that? The owner? Well, guess what? The owner is Aunt Susie. She's never been to that site. She doesn't know anything about it. Her name just kind of got on there so that the real people who were running the place don't get in trouble because they don't own it. Okay, so now you come into the controller. So you have the owner and the controller. The controller is the one who is not technically the owner, but he's the one who runs the place. He's the one who makes the decisions as to whether we're going to reclaim the land or not. And then you have the third group, or the agents. Who don't own the land, they don't control the land, but they deal with the government. We have, in fact, a lot of different agents. One of the primary agents in the US is lawyers. Nobody wants to go into court alone and do it on their own. They want help. They want an agent. Okay, so in this regard, we can see then that the child inside of us is the actual owner of our lives. Where we feel long, etc., like that. And then we have this set of rules that we've learned all of our lives. So think about that. The— it's the DNA is the owner, the child, the reptilian mind, the part that feels. But the rules are very much like the contents of that bucket, and the contents can get very heavy. And so the contents of the bucket determine how the bucket's going to be used. The content of the bucket determines the bucket, not the bucket itself. Okay, if you can understand that concept, now we can bring in the third one, which is the agent. And the agent's job is to protect the owner, basically to protect the owner from the contents. All right, how does that work? Well, we can see then that if the real owner of our life is the instincts, the feelings, the anterior cortex of the brain, and then we see that it's the mammalian brain or the temporal cortex, the mid part, that has all of the concepts, all of the codes, all of the contents of the mind. Verbally, conceptually, and all of that. And then we have the frontal cortex, which is the actual witness, that which can see, that which can put two and two together, right? That's the agent. And what we're looking for is to put the agent in gear to nurture and care for the child and deflect the child and deflect the incoming so that the child doesn't get wounded. And mostly we're protecting the child from the contents or the rules or the way things are supposed to be, the parent. So the parent starts off with a child being nurturing, but by the time the child is 3 or 4 years old, especially by the age of 6, now the child is put to work. The concepts and the rules and how to do things gets heaped upon the child, that when we're really young, we're just happy and joyful and play all the time, and then we're put to work, right? So we need now to bring this agent back in to help the child deal with all of the world and its rules and rites and rituals and supposed-tos and the whole culture, and that we need an agent, someone who can wake up to protect the child, to wake up to bring that frontal cortex, to bring the human part of the mind into it, and to protect the child so that the child feels safe. The child feels unsafe because of all the rules that are listed. Go do this, go do that, you can't have your ice cream until you eat your peanut butter, you know, all of that kind of stuff, all of these rules. You can't have dessert until you eat your broccoli. Instead of saying, hey, why don't you really enjoy that broccoli? That broccoli is good stuff. Just pay attention to it, taste it, maybe even put your pudding with it, make a broccoli chocolate ice cream, or, you know, whatever like that, like a kid would do. But no, the rules are, no, you've got to eat the broccoli before you have the— I mean, that's not in every household, but I think that it's pretty universal that the moms go around telling the kids what they're supposed to eat first. Silly rules that don't mean anything, but they're part of the culture. So when you recognize that almost all of our culture is built up of silly rules And we wind up being in a lot of pain and giving each other a whole lot of pain because we apply these silly rules instead of applying the Buddha's rule. Buddha's got only one rule: Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Wake up and see what you're doing and make a change to come out of it. That's the only teaching of the Buddha. Wake up, take a look, make a change, and feel good about.

**Speaker B:** It. Okay, that makes sense. So the agent would be— I know this is very abstract, but it'd be like just what really makes you try to follow Dhamma and just— because it's self-imposed. So the owner will be the one imposing the rules, like, on it. On the child, and the agent would be like this other voice?

**Speaker A:** You're a higher self. You're better wisdom. Okay, the one who's actually been to real law school, not the Don Chaco who's telling you what to do. Okay, so we could say that it's our own higher mind, it's our wisdom, it's the ability to know and see reality And the job of that agent is to protect the child from all the bullshit that comes out of the parent, as well as all the other parents out there. All because everybody lives presenting themselves as a superego. I'm who I am because I'm supposed to be that way, is how we present ourselves.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. It's funny how like there's this voice that just portrays itself as being rational, even though like deep down. So I think the agent is the one that deep down knows that you've been through that like the past 10, 15 times, and that approach didn't work of like anxiety and just self-flagellation. But it's this, just this voice telling you, oh, this time you need to be just, you need to be worried, you need to be very anxious about this. But then like there's this other voice that's just like, no, this doesn't make any sense. So I guess that'd be like the agent.

**Speaker A:** Right, right. So no, you don't have to be uptight. No, you don't have to. Everything's already okay. So that nurturing quality is what we're bringing out to be able to remember wisely that you're okay, that everything is all right. That you are safe, you are sound, you are secure, you are comfortable. And when we have that, then we can generate also the feeling of being satisfied, that this is good enough. And we're looking for that state of satisfaction, that I can rest because the job that needed to be done has been done. The well-done job. Even in the old days of the plantations, when sundown came, the foreman would shout something out, and then everybody who was out there picking cotton would generally sit down. They would just stop what they were doing and just sit down and take a rest. They don't bother to come out of the field and go home and wash their hands and change their clothes and then rest. They just sit down right where they are and just, ah, the job has been done. Okay, so what is the job to be done? The job to be done is to call off the work. Time to finish. Stop. Stop all of the working. Stop all of the desiring. Stop everything and just sit down and enjoy the moment.

**Speaker B:** Rest.

**Speaker A:** The job has just been done. Okay, I get it now. That's actually in the sutras, by the way, that the job that has to be done has been done. There is nothing left to do.

**Speaker B:** What is that?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the only thing we have to do is to throw out the hindrances, to throw out our to-do list. Imagine that you just sit down for 30 minutes or so with a to-do list and write down everything. You can actually call it a bucket list. Okay, what have I got to do? What are my things to do? Okay, so we get that list of all— and maybe 3, 4 pages long. And to now, according to the teaching of the Buddha, what are we going to do? We're going to wind that list up. Set it down and says, job done. All of those things are not important. They don't need to be done. What needed to be done was to set them down, to put them away, to stop having the idea that I've got to do and I've got to do and I've got to do. Because that's all that culture, that's all that Sila Bhadra Paramasa is— attachment to the way things are supposed to be. Rather than enjoying the heck out of things the way that they actually already.

**Speaker B:** Are. That's great. The first time you mentioned the metaphor, like in the Sangha call, it wasn't clear to me, but now, like, it's just pretty palpable in a way. I'm going to try to apply that like from now on and just see through the charade of like, oh, the thing that helped me most is just this explaining of the attachment to rules and just how things are supposed to be, because that's how we grow up to just to feel like, right? And it's— I was always just a very subservient, like, person, just needed just to be approved and validation. So this This is definitely good to hear that it's not needed. So that was great, Dhammarato. I really appreciate it.

**Speaker A:** Great. Well, you go practice this way, as if the only thing that's important is to enjoy this present moment. This is it. This is all we've got. All the work that needed to be done right now, we don't have to do anything except just sit here and enjoy life, taking this next breath. This is good enough. Let the future take care of itself.

**Speaker B:** Okay, that's great. I think I'm almost running into like the time. I'm not sure if you have a preset time or— because we're already 53 minutes in.

**Speaker A:** No, no, the— let us say the hour. Is sort of like a, um, uh, an indicator or a mile marker or whatever. But sometimes, especially when there's more than one on the video, it can go for an hour and a half or whatever like that. But we've been doing about 51 minutes. This is, is good. This is a good time. But the important point is, is that we're not here because of the clock. We're here because I want to see that great big smile on your face, like, yeah, I got it!

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay. Yeah, I'm going against the rule here, but I'm like, oh, what is Dhammarato thinking? Maybe Dhammarato is already looking at a clock and saying, oh my God, he's gonna just run past like the allotted time. And so yeah, that's— no, I'm looking at you.

**Speaker A:** I'm looking at your face. I'm looking at your joy. I'm looking at you. I've got it.

**Speaker B:** That's what we're looking for. That's really it. It's just— I'm laughing, but it's just really like, this is really incredible. It's just like, just getting like just a very heavy weight off my shoulders, you know. It's kind of like validation. It's like, oh, you can just not worry about it. It's just like, somebody needs to tell me that in order for me to just go, oh, maybe I can actually just not really take that too seriously. Like. So, so yeah, this, this was definitely great. I think I can't even ask like a follow-up question because this is just such a high note that I'm ending. And I just, I don't know. Yeah, I'm not gonna say now I'm gonna go start stumbling on my words.

**Speaker A:** But— Well, go practice, go play with it, go, go have some fun with Anapanasati, go enjoy Breathing, enjoy, and talk to yourself about, 'Oh, this does feel really good. I can in fact experience this present moment.' That's the way to practice. Okay, okay.

**Speaker B:** So thank you so much, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** I hope to see you soon. Don't wait so long next time. And also, you could join our Sangha on the Skype. We have the Sangha US and the Sangha UK groups. And I invite you to join those to find some friends. We need Sangha here also. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Got a lot of Anagami here. Yeah, count on me for that, Dhammarato. And again, I really, really like to just say thank you again because it was really helpful. So I really, really appreciate it.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. All right. Well, we'll see you soon.

**Speaker B:** Thank you so much, Dhammarato. Bye-bye. Have a great day.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a student named Victor (Speaker B), centers on moving from anxiety-driven practice to a joyful, present-moment approach to the Buddha's path. Here is a summary of the key themes and instructions:

### **Core Themes & Shifts in Understanding**

1.  **From Anxiety to Clarity:** Victor shares his initial struggle with chronic anxiety, which he once believed was necessary for productivity. Through practice (including a retreat), his mind cleared, allowing him to see anxiety as counterproductive and creating space for deeper Dhamma inquiry.

2.  **"Gladdening the Mind" is a State Change:** Dhammarato clarifies that "gladdening the mind" is not abstract contemplation or positive thinking about life conditions. It is the practical act of **changing your mental state** by using skillful thoughts to shift out of hindrances (like dullness or worry) into a brighter, more open state. It's an integrated process where thoughts affect state, and state affects feelings.

3.  **Critique of "Concentration" (Samādhi):** A major point is that "concentration" is a poor translation of *samādhi*. True *samādhi* is **not about narrow focus or absorption** (like being lost in code or whack-a-mole), which makes you miss the wider reality. Instead, it's about **unification of mind and body through mindful attention (sati)**, like continuously remembering to take long, deep breaths. The Zen stick metaphor illustrates this: the master hits anyone not aware of their surroundings, emphasizing wakefulness over trance.

4.  **Practice as Play, Not a War:** Victor describes closed-eye meditation as a "war zone." Dhammarato reframes this entirely: **The mind is a playground, not a battlefield.** The attitude should be one of playful investigation and enjoyment, not grim, victimized struggle. Trying to "guarantee" progress or build a perfect practice is like building a fragile house of cards—it's unsustainable and fear-based.

5.  **What is Truly Important?** Dhammarato strips away cultural conditioning: The only thing that is truly important is **being alive and fully experiencing this present moment, symbolized by this very breath.** Society creates 10,000 "important" things (work, bills, status), which cause suffering. Wisdom sees that enjoying this breath is fundamental; everything else is secondary.

6.  **The Owner, Controller, & Agent Model:** To explain internal dynamics, Dhammarato uses a legal metaphor:
    *   **The Owner:** The inner child, the primal feeler (instincts, raw experience).
    *   **The Controller/Rules:** The accumulated cultural conditioning, "shoulds," and personality view (*sakkāya-diṭṭhi*) that dictate behavior.
    *   **The Agent:** The wise, frontal-cortex capacity for mindfulness and wisdom. Its job is to **protect the Owner (the child) from the harshness of the Controller/Rules and external criticism.** People often criticize their *idea* of you, not your core self. The agent learns not to "stand up and be the target."

7.  **The Job That's Already Done:** The ultimate goal is to realize that **the only "work" is to stop all "work" and desiring.** It's to put down the endless mental to-do list, recognize things are already good enough, and simply rest in satisfaction here and now. As the suttas say: "The job that has to be done has been done."

### **Practical Instructions**

*   **Anapanasati (Mindfulness of Breathing):** Use the breath as an anchor in reality. Remembering to take each breath long and deep is itself an act of unifying mind and body. The breath is a tangible, present-moment experience.
*   **Change Your Language:** Replace hindering thoughts ("This is hard," "war zone") with enabling ones ("playground," "this is fun and easy").
*   **Investigate, Don't Contemplate:** The path is about **observing reality** (like the impermanence of a thought) in the moment, not about conceptual philosophizing or building intellectual stories.
*   **Protect Your Inner Child:** Use your wise "agent" mind to nurture a sense of safety and satisfaction, deflecting internal and external criticism based on arbitrary rules.
*   **Cultivate Satisfaction:** Actively develop the feeling that "this is good enough." The practice is about deepening this satisfaction, not about achieving a next thing.

### **Conclusion**

The talk guides Victor from a goal-oriented, anxiety-fueled practice toward a **Dhamma of joyful presence.** The path is simplified: wake up to the present moment, see what causes suffering (often attachment to rules and future goals), change your attitude to one of playful investigation, and rest in the satisfaction that comes from knowing the only important thing—being fully alive right now—is already here. The session ends with Victor experiencing a palpable sense of relief and lightness, having put down a "heavy weight."

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several vivid metaphors and stories to illustrate Dhamma concepts. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors & Stories:**

1.  **The Race Car Driver and Grandma's Car:**
    *   **Purpose:** To explain how meditation (mindfulness) reveals pre-existing problems.
    *   **Story:** A professional driver takes Grandma's car for a short drive and immediately senses everything wrong with it (e.g., suspension issues). The problems were always there; the expert's sensitive awareness simply revealed them. Similarly, anxiety was always present in the student's life; a settled mind (from practice) allowed him to finally see it clearly.

2.  **The House of Cards:**
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate the futility and stress of trying to build a guaranteed, permanent state of peace.
    *   **Metaphor:** Building a house of cards is a fun, skillful activity when you accept it will fall. The suffering comes when you build it, believe it's important and permanent, and then live in fear of it collapsing. The student's desire for a "guarantee" in his practice is like this.

3.  **The Whack-a-Mole & The Inattentive Coder:**
    *   **Purpose:** To critique the common misunderstanding of "concentration" (*samādhi*) as narrow focus, and to promote "attention" or awareness (*sati*).
    *   **Stories:**
        *   A child playing **Whack-a-Mole** concentrates so hard on one hole that he misses all the others. A master player concentrates so deeply he doesn't notice his girlfriend behind him. This is the downside of "concentration"—it causes you to miss the wider reality.
        *   A younger child, told not to be on the computer, **hears his dad coming** and quickly shuts it off. He is paying *attention* to his surroundings. Years later, as a teen **deeply concentrated on writing code**, he ignores his dad entirely and causes conflict. The first is mindful awareness; the second is problematic absorption.

4.  **The Zen Stick (*Kyōsaku*):**
    *   **Purpose:** To define true mindfulness (*sati*) as a broad, alert presence, not a concentrated trance.
    *   **Story:** The Zen master hits with a stick anyone who is lost—whether in deep concentration, drowsiness, or daydreaming. The point is "wakey-wakey!"—to remember to come out of the mind and into the reality of the senses. True *sati* is this alert presence.

5.  **The Mind as a Playground vs. a War Zone:**
    *   **Purpose:** To reframe the student's attitude toward meditation from one of struggle to one of joyful exploration.
    *   **Metaphor:** The student describes closing his eyes to meditate as entering a "war zone." Dhammarato counters that the mind should be seen as a **"wonderful playground"**—a safe space to investigate and enjoy experience. This shifts the identity from a victim in a battle to a child at play.

6.  **The Legal Triad: Owner, Controller, Agent:**
    *   **Purpose:** To model the psyche and explain how to protect one's core self ("the child") from internal and external criticism.
    *   **Metaphor:** Adapted from U.S. legal code regarding land reclamation.
        *   **The Owner:** The "child" within—the raw, feeling, instinctual core (the reptilian/emotional brain). The true self that feels pain or joy.
        *   **The Controller/Rules:** The "parent" or internalized culture—the set of rules, "shoulds," and conditioned personality (the mammalian/conceptual brain). This is who we *present* to the world.
        *   **The Agent:** The "higher self" or wisdom—the observing, discerning frontal cortex. Its job is to **protect the Owner (the child)** from the harshness of the Controller/Rules and the judgments of the external world. It realizes criticism is aimed at the "presented self," not the true core.

7.  **The Plantation Worker at Sundown:**
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate the state of satisfaction, rest, and "job done" that is the goal.
    *   **Story:** At the end of the workday, the plantation workers don't go home to rest; they simply sit down right where they are in the field. The job is done; they can rest *immediately*. Similarly, the "job" in practice is to drop the to-do list and the striving mind *right now* and find satisfaction in the present moment.

8.  **The Slings and Arrows of Outrageous Fortune:**
    *   **Purpose:** To explain how we voluntarily take on suffering from criticism.
    *   **Metaphor:** Borrowing from Shakespeare, Dhammarato says criticism (slings and arrows) often misses the true target (the real "Owner"/child). We suffer because we "stand up" and identify with the presented self (the Rules/Controller), saying "that's me!" and thus get hit. Wisdom is letting the arrows pass by, recognizing they aren't aimed at the true self.

### **Summary of Core Themes Through Metaphor:**
*   **Practice is Discovery, Not Construction:** (Race Car Driver, House of Cards).
*   **Mindfulness is Alert Awareness, Not Narrow Concentration:** (Whack-a-Mole, Zen Stick).
*   **Adopt a Playful, Joyful Attitude:** (Playground vs. War Zone).
*   **Deconstruct the Psyche to End Suffering:** (Owner/Controller/Agent, Slings and Arrows).
*   **The Goal is Present-Moment Satisfaction, Not Future Achievement:** (Plantation Worker, "job done").

These metaphors effectively translate abstract Buddhist psychology into relatable, modern scenarios, helping the student reframe his experience of anxiety and practice.
