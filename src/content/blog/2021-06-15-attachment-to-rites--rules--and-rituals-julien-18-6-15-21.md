### Transcript


**Speaker A:** See what you're doing with that when you're saying you want to be glad, and you're actually saying, child inside, you're not good enough yet, you need to have joy, you're a piece of crap right now. And there's a child, oh, I don't feel the joy, I don't feel the joy. All right, well, with that kind of dialogue language going on, of course we're not going to feel it. So good to see you again, Julian. And you had reported that you had been doing a bit of an online course.

**Speaker B:** That's right. Yeah, I did.

**Speaker A:** And that you got some questions about that. And you also mentioned something about that. Gladdening the mind was work to do that you were resisting doing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Or how did you phrase it?

**Speaker B:** That it felt forceful and I had trouble with that. And sometimes it seemed like I was curious as to whether gladdening the mind is more of a letting go or more of a fostering. The good emotions? Because when I've tried to take the fostering or forcing the good emotions, sometimes it's been a little bit difficult for me.

**Speaker A:** All right, we can start off with the overall point that it's a matter of attitude. Now let's get into it a little bit. How can we develop right attitude? How can we develop Samma Sanghappa? The question has to do with basically letting go of the Sila, Bhante, Paramasa, that we are attached to rights, rules, rituals, and ways of doing things. And we do that for our whole lives, that we'll hear something that we think is a good idea or is a rule to be followed. And so then we'll make it a rule in our own mind. We'll pick it up and then we'll play the old tapes. Okay, we continue to do that our whole lives. And that the practice of Anapanasati means that we have to make a slight change to that. Another way of talking about it is, is that when we tell ourselves you should be gladdened up, or that this is the practice and you want to do it, and you resist doing it. That's exactly the same dialogue that is played out in every human being's mind throughout the day, all day long. And that is a dialogue between the parent and the child. You see, basically, when you're talking about gladdening the mind, it's something that you should do. And then any things that you tell yourself that you should do, there's naturally going to be an internal rebellion against doing what you should do. This is the dialogue between the parent ego state and the child ego state, or what Sigmund Freud called between the ego— excuse me, superego and the id. All right. And the superego, or this parent ego state, is a set of rights, rules, rituals, laws, would, shoulds, coulds, everything that we've heard from our parents. It's quite broad. A lot of people think that the parent ego state is kind of tiny, and also they look at Sila Bhata Paramasa and say, oh, there's not much to it because I don't like many of the rules anyway. But they don't realize that in fact that's basically the internal speech or the internal dialogue. Everything that you say to yourself is basically giving marching orders. That's especially true when we consider it that it's critical thought, critical thought of 'I like this, I don't like that, I want this to be better, this work needs to be done,' all of that kind of stuff. And now, on top of all of that stuff, marching orders and everything we told ourselves that we've got to do for so many years, we had now a new one: you must relax, or you must gladden the mind. All right, so here's what I mean about an attitude change, is that we've got to see that change, that cutting off this critical thought, including critical thoughts of you must gladden the mind, is basically what we need to do. This is the way of looking at wholesome thoughts versus unwholesome thoughts. Telling yourself you ought to relax, telling yourself you ought to feel good telling yourself you ought to gladden the mind is just more marching orders. And the child is against marching orders. It's almost like inertia in the sense that if we're not doing anything, whatever we're doing right now, which is nothing much, is the way to go. For instance, the best way for a car is while it's sitting is to just sit. But once it's out on the road rolling, now the tendency is to continue to roll. This is what we mean by inertia. It doesn't mean that things want to stop. It means that they tend to keep going the way that they're going. So we have to find a way of pulling this newly found brilliant information and take it away from the parent, give it to the child as a toy to play with. It cannot be a job to do in order to get a reward. Rather, it has got to be the reward itself. The gladdening of the mind is actually the reward for the child, not that he's got to do anything. Okay, but that's the whole point, is when we hear things like Anapanasati, the natural tendency for an ordinary mind is to make that a rule. Oh, it sounds really good, sounds like we ought to do that, therefore we should do that. The better way of practicing is is to check how good this is right now, letting things be good right now, saying things that indicate that things are already good right now rather than making it immediately in the future of you should, you ought to. It's like taking a deep breath is so much more refreshing than telling ourselves you ought to take a deep breath and then not doing it. So whatever we can do for getting the motivation going, if that's the word— in fact, that may not be the right word, because motivation means that we've got to move from here to go there in order to do something. That's what they mean by motion or motivate. You got to get up and get going, or or whatever like that, to where in fact this is not motivation, like you want to meditate or you want to gladden the mind, but rather this is a practice to actually do that in the present moment. Okay, so that means that when you remember, you can just gladden up. You can smile, give yourself a little humor, tell yourself a little joke like, oh wow, I've seen this before. Well, I've been resistant to happiness before when in fact I could have just been happy instead. And so these are the kind of thoughts that you can have to remember that you have to take the practice of meditation out of the critical parent. Ego state and put it into, uh, the position of it being a gift for the child, for the very natural part of you, to give yourself joy, to give yourself pleasure, rather than telling yourself you ought to have joy, you ought to have pleasure. So it is a matter of changing our attitude or changing our, uh, mind state from the state of the critical parent into the state of the joyous child? How can you make that change? One of the ways that you can do it is with a good statement to start off with. While I don't have to blah blah blah blah blah An example of that is, well, I don't even have to gladden my mind. Wow, what a relief!

**Speaker B:** That's a funny one.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's a whole lot better way of doing it than telling yourself, you ought to gladden your mind. No, I don't want to. You ought to gladden your mind. No, I don't want to. Yeah, but that no, I don't want to is almost always expressed as a feeling or an emotion, not in dialogue or not in discursive thinking. But the 'you want to feel joy, you want to have gladness,' that is discursive thinking.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think the friction, the difficulties come from— or at least in my mind, it doesn't feel like it's that I don't want to, but it's that it just seems hard. I go, okay, gladden the mind, Sukkha. And then it just— the mind's kind of hard to grasp and just force it in a certain direction, you know.

**Speaker A:** Grasp— that's an interesting one. Does this grasping look restful and peaceful?

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker A:** How about this?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so again, it's a mental attitude, the grasping after it, like that you should do it or that you need to do it, and, and that you're feeling unfulfilled, um, almost as if it were attainment, that we don't know what to do. And, and it's basically a 180. It's from out there grasping into, never mind, I don't need that, everything's all right anyway, I don't even have to gladden my mind. Isn't that a relief? But you see, I don't even have to gladden my mind that I, uh, what a relief. That's a statement of gladdening the mind. 'You ought to gladden the mind' is not. That's a critical thought. And I know that this is kind of subtle, but you can tell that it really does change the way that you practice from an actual practice that gains value, and it takes us back into the world that we've been living in all along anyway. Which is just the interchange between the parent of going around doing what you're told to do, said to a child who's reluctant to do it. So we have to talk ourselves into things. All right, this dialogue that we're talking about between the parent and the child, this dialogue is what needs to be seen And recognizing that it comes up, it's Anicca too. Sometimes it's there, sometimes it's not. And it arises and then it passes away. And part of your job is to watch that whole thing pass away. Once you see it, you're basically saying goodbye to this dialogue between the parent, the child, if you ought to do this and you ought to do that. And in that goodbye kiss is what a relief to see that dialogue go. And we can think of Vinaya, of nurturing thoughts, the way that a mother nurtures a baby, a tender infant. And the mother does not have any expectations. The mother of a tender infant doesn't come into that tender infant and says You ought to gladden your mind. What does she do instead? Goo goo ga ga, goo goo ga ga. Okay, so we need to get into that child ego state, just like the mom will get into the child ego state and do goo goo ga ga, and comes out of that parent ego state in the sense of, you ought to, you ought to buck up, baby. 'You ought to cheer up,' because babies are not going to cheer up when they're told to cheer up. Infants of even the child ego state of the adult doesn't cheer up because he's told to cheer up. All right, so changing that frame of reference of 'you want to do it like this' and bringing it into nurturing really wholesome thoughts is what the practice is. And what that means now is the relinquishment or the letting go is of the critical thinking, because those are the unwholesome thoughts.

**Speaker B:** So would you say that this is like changing the attitude from, I guess, a parent, a strict parent to a child, changing it from that to just a friend. And that's how we think of how I relate to my mind.

**Speaker A:** Yes, precisely. That's a really excellent word to use. I haven't used it yet, but I was going to, and that is to make friends with ourselves. That instead of having this one-up, one-down relation within our own mind, is that same up-down relationship that we've had when we were born, starting with parents, teachers, uncles, grandparents, people on the street, older kids. And so we get in the habit of establishing one-up, one-down relationships. But children also establish friendship relationships. When kids are playing with kids their own age, and we have a lot of kids here during COVID the schools are out, but we've got neighbor kids. And also a mom brings her two kids over to play with the kids that are here too. So sometimes we have 3 or 4 kids in the house and you can hear them yelling and laughing and screaming, and not one of them is telling the other one, you ought to go do something. Not one of them is telling you. They're playing together, okay? So they're friends. And in friends, it's not a matter of one up and one down, or one up and one down, or equal. It's a matter that when you're friends, you're not making any comparisons. So that's one of the ways of looking at the correct practice of Anapanasati is also to relinquish trying to get anything out of Anapanasati. Because that wanting something out of it is coming out of that parent ego state, that the child is there just to enjoy what we do have. And so basically, we can say what a relief it is to be out of that hindering critical mind, that restless mind, that mind that has grasping and clinging and liking and not liking and jobs to do and all of that world that Byrne has called the superego. This is what the Buddha refers to in several regards. One of them is hindrances. And another one, he talks about it in the sense of relinquishing all the rules that we've given ourselves, because when we're all following, we're not feeling good. And so all of these rules, or the sibbhabhatta paramasa itself, not only is a fetter in one's life over a long period of time, but it is also the hindrance that keeps popping up in the moment. That it manifests itself over a long period of time, but it only manifests itself in this present moment. Okay, and so there you are sitting on the floor telling yourself you want to meditate, telling yourself you ought to gladden the mind. Well, that's out of the same critical mindset that you have been doing it much of your whole life out of that one-up, one-down position and get yourself into being really friendly with yourself. Hey, let's make this a toy. This is a game to play. This is not a job to do. We're not expecting any results for the future. We're expecting only the results of enjoying the moment right now.

**Speaker B:** That makes a lot of sense, and I love that explanation.

**Speaker A:** It's very interesting that way, that it's a change of attitude.

**Speaker B:** And I guess that this probably goes for other things besides Anapanasati too, right? This is probably maybe the right attitude to have with things in life in general. Yes, but not as a rule, but

**Speaker A:** not as a rule, but as a moment of play, a moment of joy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, when we start having more and more moments of play and more and more moments of joy, that does not make us completely unproductive. In some cases, it makes us even more productive than the guy who's struggling with something. If we get too narrow, too focused, not see outside the box. But when we're playing, there's no boxes. There's hidey-holes and forts and all kinds of things, but there's no boxes. But the adult sees everything in categorizations or boxes or ways of frames of reference, ways of looking at things. And so here what we're inviting to do is to take those boundaries that were set up by the critical mind and play with them. Allow everything to be an interesting toy to play with. Aha, I caught you, Mara. Yes, making friends with oneself, making friends between the parent and the child and the adult. That friendship, in fact, is in fact the whole point of the Eightfold Noble Path. This is very clear when the Buddha starts the Sutta number 117, the Great Forty, when he says, listen closely, folks— didn't call them folks, called them Bhikkhus— listen closely, Bhikkhus, I will teach you right unification of mind. With its supports and results, or supports and features. Now, basically what supports the Eightfold— excuse me, the right unification of mind— are right view, right Sati, right effort, and right attitude. Those are the supports. When we have those skills developed and bring them together, the mind is unified. And then the features of the unified mind is high-quality mindset, where the mind will not go and do things that will pull the mind out of that noble space, which means then that one's right speech, right action, and right livelihood are actually the result of correct practice. But the way that it's taught in Buddhism from children, I mean, the first thing that happens in a meditation retreat is run by monks, or what happens at every Buddha Day is it throws up.

**Speaker B:** The last thing I heard you say was on the meditation retreat or on the Buddha Day, the first thing that

**Speaker A:** happens is— Okay, the first thing that happens is that they do the ceremonies called the Triple Gem, taking refuge into the Buddha, and also the precepts. Now, this is done by ordinary people for ordinary people. And the mistake that is made is that they assume that the practice of the Triple Gem and the practice of Sila is part of the practice. But the reality of it is, is that if the practice that the Buddha recommends is done correctly, then one's morality or Sila is the natural outcome of correct practice, not the cause, or not the correct practice. In other words, if your mind is straight, if you don't want anything, then you're unlikely to go take something. If your mind is not straight and you really want something, now you have to have an internal dialogue. Are you going to steal that or not? But if you don't want it, you got no trouble from the beginning. This is why the, uh, the unification of mind is so important. And you can also see that this unification of mind that we're talking about can be seen also in the sense of the unification of mind between the parent, the adult, and the child, or these three ego states that Byrne and Freud were able to detect. This is that we are a crowd inside, that we do try to protect things. An example of that is when someone does wrongdoing, their own parent ego state says You're not supposed to do that. But now that you have done it, we don't want anybody to know that you're doing it, that you've done it, because you're not supposed to do it. Therefore, we hide what we've done, we lie about it, etc. And what that does is that breaks the mind into a disunity. Or another way of saying it, no, it was already broken into disunity. That's why the lie was able to occur. If the mind had been unified, there would have been no reason to try to hide the wrongdoing, because if the wrongdoing defines Dukkha or sets up Dukkha, then we want to be finished with that. All right, so if I see that I've had wrongdoing, then I want to repair that wrongdoing. And so we don't try to hide it or cover it up. So these are the kinds of things that we can look at. Now, another point about it is that once the mind becomes unified, let us say often enough, part of the attitude that's changing is the attitude of actually really taking refuge, not doing it as a ceremony. But when we take refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha, by taking refuge in the Buddha, that means that we've been around enough people who have the ability to clean out their mind. And so you know that you can do it because you can see that other people can do it. Then we have the Dhamma, and that is that we take refuge in the Dhamma because we can see the correct practice of meditation, rather than having a dialogue between the parent and the child, but actually generating joy, we can feel joy. And we begin to recognize that the Dharma actually works. And because of that, we can take refuge in a system that actually works, as opposed to a ceremony about taking refuge. And then the third one, naturally, is the Sangha. And that's the one that we're working on, and that is to get enough people together who are practicing correctly so that they can support each other and practice friendship among one another rather than the normal world of just competing. In other words, we can go back and become kids again and have real friends again and just play with our friends rather than becoming adults stuck in competition between our friends. So in that regard, the Sangha Now, we begin to take refuge in the fact that my friends and my collection of friends is part of the practice of the Buddha. So, we have all three, the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha. Now, this is actually much more available and able to be seen in Asia or in Asian temples than the United States. But the Westerners, for some reason,

**Speaker B:** We

**Speaker A:** don't have that ability to just accept people the way that they are. A lot of Westerners, when they— if they become monks, when they become monks, or sometimes before they become monks, what do they start doing? They start criticizing the monks they see. And then if they join, then they continue to be critical. And that's the whole point about joining the Sangha, is that we leave our criticism for other monks at the the door. That's the point about being with Sangha, is that this is a collection of friends. We're here to mutually support each other, not to compete with each other. And so the Sangha, as, uh, as part of that Triple Gem, is where we really take refuge, that we know that we can be friends. Uh, and so this is actually a development. This is a change of attitude that comes about through correct practice, not a set of rules. Thou shalt be friendly at the what? And so it's a different kind of way of doing it. It comes not from the superego, not from Mommy telling little Johnny, "You've got to go be friends with these people," but rather Johnny is not even listening to Mom because he's busy running and screaming towards his friends with great joy. So this is the way that we look at it, is that we bring our mind out of that parent critical ego state into a nurturing ego state so that we can give our child inside absolute permission to be okay right now. See, what you're doing with that when you're saying you want to be glad, and you're actually saying, child inside, 'You're not good enough yet. You need to have joy. You're a piece of crap right now.' And there's the child, 'Oh, I don't feel the joy. I don't feel the joy.' All right, well, with that kind of dialogue language going on, of course we're not going to feel it. And so this is the whole quality about understanding what is a hindrance, or what are unwholesome thoughts. Telling yourself you want to have joy is an unwholesome thought. Having the thought of, wow, I see that thought and I don't have to do that, I can just relax. All right, so that's the change, a very small change in the way that we look at it, uh, so that we don't have to resist the correct practice, but we're eager for it. We could also say that that eagerness is part of the skill set that is to be developed. That in one sutta, the Buddha has a group of seven knowledges that lead us from absolute ordinary worldly person to the first step of of the Noble Path right through. And along the way, in Steps 5 and 6 especially, and then in the culmination absolutely in Step 7, is the idea of joy, eagerness, enthusiasm. That we can begin to see that when we gain the attitude of enthusiasm, being enthusiastic for the correct practice, makes right effort a lot easier. In the beginning, the students don't have much enthusiasm for the practice, and so they have to put in the right effort to do it. Well, it's not going to be the right effort to do it if that effort is spawned from critical thinking of you should do it, but rather it's got to be done from the invitation of this is nice. 'Here, little Johnny, have a piece of apple,' rather than, 'You ought to eat this apple.'

**Speaker B:** It makes sense. It's quite a shift for me in many respects.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it is. It is a shift. It's subtle, but it is quite a shift. And it will be the shift from failure into Success. Yeah, operating through success, noticing success, wanting the success, not in the sense of wanting to get to success 2 or 3 breaths or 2 or 3 or 5 minutes from now, but allowing yourself to feel successful with this breath. This is good enough. So you go and practice that. This is just— we'll save this talk on just one point and not veer too far away from it and just stay with this one thing that— all right, so to get yourself into a state of actually liking it doesn't work by telling yourself you ought to like it, because the child rebels against 'ought to.' And try a bit of goo goo gaga with yourself.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, goo goo gaga meditation, the classic.

**Speaker A:** Goo goo gaga meditation. Wow, this feels so good.

**Speaker B:** Which sutta is that? I'm just kidding.

**Speaker A:** Actually, it's in the suttas that I'm using, and one would be Sutta 19. Where he's talking about the one wholesome thought after another wholesome thought after another wholesome thought. But interesting enough, the Buddha does talk about it in general senses, in the sense of unwholesome thoughts would be thoughts of criticism, thoughts of wanting, thoughts of wanting to get away from greed and ill will, and also thoughts of harmfulness. Uh, but he means it in great generalities like that, where we're getting down to absolutely specific ways of thinking and seeing that that kind of thought right there is unwholesome. And so the students begin to understand more and more clearly about what are wholesome and unwholesome thoughts. Because we've got a fairly good definition of it in a broad sense. We just need to start applying it to the individual thought processes that we have. And this critical thinking that we have about you ought to feel good or you ought to meditate is actually just an unwholesome thought about now is not good enough. If you'd go meditate, things would get better. And that's uncritical. That's more criticism. A more wholesome thing we're saying is, is that, hey man, everything's okay right now. You don't have to meditate. The Zen are actually quite clear with that in the sense of, you're already enlightened, what do you want? Just sit here, you're already enlightened. So getting us out of that wanting state out of wanting joy and speaking about wanting it from that critical parent of 'you ought to feel joy' can be turned around completely by saying it's okay to just relax. Whatever joy that you do feel, whatever gladdening that you do have allow that to actually work. Yeah, this is good. But the critical mind says, well, it is good, but I want more. Well, now we're practicing wanting more. We've already been excellent at wanting more. What we need to do now instead is practicing of being satisfied with what little bit of satisfaction we do have.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Practice satisfaction. Practice this. Good enough. This is fine. No place to go and nothing to do, and everything's just hunky-dory. All

**Speaker B:** right, thank you.

**Speaker A:** So do you have any questions about this? I think that we've gotten this topic pretty well covered.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I don't think I do. This is super relevant to me because even when I find myself thinking about the Dhamma, which is supposed to be wholesome, I think about it often in this type of like, oh, you ought to, you ought to type of way, and it ends up being not wholesome. And that was confusing for me.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. Excellent. So it's not a matter of when you were talking about letting go or relinquishment. Uh, we just need to change that focus just a little bit. It's the critical mind state that needs to be relinquished to be able to see those unwholesome thoughts and relinquish those. When you just stop telling yourself you ought to feel good, then you'll start to feel good. But so long as you're telling yourself you ought to feel good, you won't.

**Speaker B:** All right, that makes sense. All right, thank you,

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato. Excellent, Julian. We'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** I'll see you later.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Bye.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friend Julian (Speaker B), centers on a common obstacle in meditation: the struggle to "gladden the mind" (*sukha*) and how our internal dialogue sabotages it.

Here is a concise summary of the key teachings:

### **Core Problem: The Internal Parent-Child Dynamic**
*   The difficulty in cultivating joy often stems from an internal dialogue between a **critical "parent" voice** (superego) and a resistant "child" voice (id).
*   When you think, "I *should* gladden my mind" or "I *ought* to feel joy," you are speaking from the critical parent. This is experienced by the inner child as a reprimand: "You're not good enough yet." Naturally, the child rebels or feels inadequate, making joy impossible.
*   This pattern turns meditation into a chore, a "job to do" for a future reward, which creates resistance and friction.

### **The Solution: A Radical Shift in Attitude**
The practice is not about forcing a feeling but about **changing your relationship with yourself**.

1.  **From Critic to Friend/Nurturer:** Shift from a top-down, commanding relationship (parent-child) to a friendly, nurturing one. Be a kind friend or a nurturing mother to your own mind—offering permission and comfort, not demands.
2.  **From "Should" to "Could" (or "Don't Have To"):** Replace critical thoughts with freeing ones. Instead of "I should gladden my mind," try "What a relief, I *don't even have to* gladden my mind!" This removes the pressure and can instantly create space for ease.
3.  **Make Practice a Gift, Not a Job:** Frame meditation as a **toy, a game, or a reward** for the inner child to enjoy *right now*. The joy is in the present-moment practice itself, not in a future attainment.
4.  **Relinquish the Critical Mind:** The key "letting go" is letting go of **critical thinking itself**. Wholesome thought is not about forcing positivity, but about abandoning the unwholesome thought that "now is not good enough."

### **Broader Dhamma Context**
*   This approach aligns with **Right Attitude/Intention** (*Samma Sankappa*) and involves letting go of attachment to rules and rituals (*silabbata paramasa*).
*   A unified, joyful mind cultivated this way naturally leads to ethical conduct (*Sila*), which is an **outcome** of correct practice, not its grim prerequisite.
*   This friendly attitude extends to Sangha practice—communities should be about mutual support and joyful friendship, not competition or criticism.
*   The talk references the **"goo goo ga ga"** metaphor: just as a mother nurtures an infant without demands, nurture your mind with gentle, undemanding encouragement.

### **Practical Takeaway**
**Stop trying to *achieve* a gladdened mind.** Notice when your meditation is driven by the critical parent's "should." Interrupt that pattern with a friendly, permission-giving thought ("It's okay to relax," "This is good enough"). By **practicing satisfaction** with the present moment, however small, you bypass internal resistance and allow genuine gladdening to arise naturally.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several key **metaphors and stories** to explain the psychological dynamic of meditation and the shift in attitude required for "gladdening the mind":

### **Metaphors:**

1.  **The Parent-Child Dialogue (Internal Critic vs. Inner Child):** This is the central metaphor. The mind is depicted as having a **"parent ego state"** (critical, rule-giving, full of "shoulds" and "oughts") and a **"child ego state"** (rebellious, resistant to commands, seeking joy). The struggle to "gladden the mind" is framed as this internal parent ordering the child to be happy, which causes rebellion and failure.

2.  **Inertia (The Rolling Car):** Used to explain the child's resistance. The mind's current state, even if neutral or slightly negative, tends to continue due to inertia. Trying to force a change ("you should be happy") is like trying to push a parked car, while the natural state is to keep rolling as it is.

3.  **A Toy vs. A Job / A Reward vs. A Task:** The correct attitude is to make meditation and gladdening the mind a **"toy" for the child** to play with or a **"reward"** to enjoy. The wrong attitude is treating it as a **"job"** or a task assigned by the critical parent that must be completed for a future reward.

4.  **The Nurturing Mother and Infant:** To illustrate the correct, non-critical attitude, the speaker describes how a mother nurtures a baby: with gentle, playful sounds ("goo goo ga ga") and no expectations or commands ("you ought to cheer up"). The practitioner should adopt this nurturing, gentle attitude toward their own mind.

5.  **Making Friends with Yourself:** This metaphor extends the parent-child model. The goal is to move from a **"one-up, one-down"** relationship (like parent-child) to a **friendship** within the mind. Friends play together without giving orders, making comparisons, or expecting results.

6.  **Hindrances as Boxes, Play as Having No Boxes:** The adult, critical mind sees things in categorized "boxes." The playful, friendly mind has "hidey-holes and forts" but no rigid boxes, allowing for freedom and creativity.

7.  **"Catching Mara":** A brief reference to the Buddhist figure of Mara (the temper, personification of hindrances). Seeing a hindrance arise and playfully noting "Aha, I caught you, Mara!" turns observation into a game.

### **Stories and Analogies:**

1.  **The Story of Children Playing:** The speaker references observing children playing during COVID. They yell, laugh, and play together, with **no one telling the others what they "ought" to do**. This is held up as a model for the internal friendship and playfulness we should cultivate.

2.  **The Story of the Western Monk Who Criticizes:** This brief anecdote illustrates how the wrong attitude (the critical parent) can persist even in a spiritual context. The speaker contrasts this with the ideal of the Sangha (community) as a place where you **"leave criticism at the door"** and practice mutual support, like friends playing together.

3.  **The Apple Analogy:** To contrast motivating approaches: forcing effort ("You ought to eat this apple") vs. inviting joy ("Here, little Johnny, have a piece of apple"). The latter represents the correct, enticing method.

4.  **The Car and the Lie:** This is a cause-and-effect story to explain "disunity" of mind. When someone does wrong, the internal "parent" criticizes, leading the "child" to hide the act (lie). This creates internal conflict and division. A unified mind would simply acknowledge the error to repair it, with no need for hiding.

5.  **The Zen Reference:** The speaker alludes to a Zen teaching—**"you're already enlightened, what do you want? Just sit here"**—to reinforce the point of relinquishing the wanting, striving, critical mind and finding satisfaction in the present.

**Overall Narrative Arc:** The talk uses these metaphors to tell a story of **transformation**: from a mind at war with itself (Critical Parent vs. Rebellious Child), stuck in rules and "shoulds," to a unified, friendly mind where meditation becomes a joyful play, leading naturally to peace, morality, and true refuge in the practice.
