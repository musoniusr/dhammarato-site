### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, Robert, so we have been talking about Sati and the way that it comes and goes depending upon the levels of stress that we're under. This is very, very characteristic. The Buddha knew all about it. And so what we need to do to begin is to start with a stress-free environment so that we can then start to pay attention to the fact that this is not a stress-free environment at all. I've got quite a mess in here. Sure, that's a whole lot better than having this mess in here and trying to be on a diet or trying to withdraw from tobacco or something else, because these are additional stresses on the body. Right now, any good meditator will say that when the body is sick, when you're on a diet, or when you're withdrawing from a bad habit like tobacco or something, that's the time that you need Sati the most, right? Okay, but that's the time that it's going to be least available.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so that means now that, um, the right approach, knowing that, is to plan in advance. To build up Sati as a skill so that it's going to be there when we need it the most. This is actually very much like Murphy's Law. Now Murphy's Law is kind of a joke simply because it was Murphy's Law, uh, but Murphy's Law actually transformed first NASA and then the entire electronics industry.

**Speaker B:** Oh wow.

**Speaker A:** And here's how I did that. Anything that can go wrong will go wrong at the last or the worst possible moment, which means that when is a rocket going to blow up? Is when it's under its most stress. When is that? Liftoff time. And that's when the Explorer blew up. That's when rockets go bad. Also, when is the time when an electronic piece of equipment is most likely going to go bad? Now, this is a trick question. The time when it's most likely to go bad is when it's being handled by a human being. We're talking about like installing a hard drive into a computer. That hard drive is under most stress when it is being installed.

**Speaker B:** Why?

**Speaker A:** Because that's the time when the connectors can be put on backwards. If the drive is already installed and up and running, the next time it powers up it'll go fine because it is all plugged in. But during that plug-in time is when connectors can go, you know, like USB connectors. People will try to shove them in upside down.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** So this is the whole idea then behind Murphy's Law. It's not that anything that can go wrong will go wrong, it's the point that it goes wrong at its most stressed-out point, when you need it the most.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** This is also with Sati. The time that you need it the most is when it's least likely to be there, right?

**Speaker B:** Totally.

**Speaker A:** Why is that? Because we're all stressed out, and that's when we need the Sati. But it's hard to remember. In fact, that quality is hard to remember is, um, In Washington, D.C., when I was there, I was in several offices and found that even though these— for instance, one would be in a big company that was doing work with the government, and then you'd go to a government office, and then you go to another government office, and you'd see the same wall drawing at that particular time. It had been making the rounds. And what it was, is it was a line drawing of someone standing in a pond surrounded by alligators. And the caption of it was, is that when you're up to your hips in alligators, it's hard to remember your original intention was to drain the swamp. And here it is, that it's hard to remember. It's hard to remember that you came to Washington to drain the swamp when you're being surrounded by the alligators.

**Speaker B:** Right, right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so this is the whole point then. It's hard to remember when you need to remember the most, right? If we understand it that way, then that will actually influence our practice, because now we really understand that our practice is to practice Sati. That's the number one skill that needs to be developed.

**Speaker B:** Why?

**Speaker A:** Because we want it to be there as a skill when we need it the most.

**Speaker B:** Sure. So one thing I find kind of amazing about it, this experience of quitting smoking, is I still have those wonderful Sati, Jhana moments, you know, where I'll remember just, you know, take a deep breath and there's the hindrance, you know, "Aha, Mara, I see you." And that does still bring me the same amount of joy that it brought me before, even with the physiological stress of quitting smoking. And that's really interesting because I wasn't sure that it would, you know, I wasn't sure that I would find the same joy, you know.

**Speaker A:** Well, about the smoking, The tobacco industry kept the American culture addicted for literally decades by telling them a half-truth. It wasn't a full lie, it was a half-truth. And the true part of it was, basically, the research that they had could show that people who smoked 5 cigarettes a day, or in that neighborhood, less than a quarter of a pack, or about a quarter of a pack a day, they actually overall on large statistical basis were more healthy than ordinary people. And this helped the tobacco industry to stay in business for years. Was that half-truth, that people were actually more healthy overall by smoking 5 cigarettes a day? Here's what was really going on, though, is that people who would smoke more than that, the tobacco would build up in the body more and therefore do its poisons. But when people were smoking only 5 cigarettes a day, When people would smoke those cigarettes, only getting a few of them, they made the best of it. So you can imagine, they take and they light it and they get a drag and then they suck on it and then they take a real nice long deep breath and hold it. And then almost as if the tobacco was their excuse to take an Anapanasati breath.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** And while they were smoking that cigarette, they were breathing really well,

**Speaker B:** right?

**Speaker A:** This is very interesting when we recognize that if these objects actually, because of the way that we use the objects, make us more healthy, then it's hard to see the dangers in those products, or actually in anything that we do, that our whole lives are basically built on according to what the Buddha says, is that we're looking for gratification. That, uh, that because of the ignorance of the, uh, that's going in with the Second Noble Truth, that we want things, and so we feel better when we get them. That's the gratification. Or if we don't want something, then we feel gratified by beating the tar out of it. And this gratification that we get, that begins then to mold our lives so that we go seeking for gratification without making the inspection to see whether it's really wholesome or whether it's got disadvantages on it. This is basically the Buddhist teaching discussion of the Buddha would be what businesses have finally learned to do that they call a cost-benefit analysis. You know, many, many companies get really ruined because they bite off more than they can chew. A really clear example of that was when AOL bought Time, right? That was too much. They bit off way more than they can chew, and it destroyed AOL because of it. AOL could have been the biggest king in the internet, right? But they didn't. They didn't do a good cost-benefit analysis. They didn't recognize all of the costs that were going to be involved with them buying. This is exactly how we operate as human beings too, is smoking. We can feel the advantage of that, the taking of the deep breath, the buzz of the body, the taste of the tobacco and all of that, and we feel gratified. But then we begin to inspect a little bit more, take some more evaluation, and recognize that, hey, times have changed, income has changed, and now this tobacco is more expensive than it used to be, and therefore it costs more, and now it's not nearly as enjoyable because it's expensive. So that's one of the cost-benefits that we have to make. And overall, people then when they recognized the health cost, that's when the tobacco industry fell apart. But they were very slow going to do so. And not only that, but they built up an entire industry of half-truths that now the oil industry is using to great advantage for them to stay in business, even though they're keeping the whole planet Earth from being able to breathe well. Right, right. And so, uh, these big companies will take an advantage to, uh, because the products that they have have a mixed advantage, that there's, um, cost as well as benefits, but they only want to sell the benefits and hide the cost. And it's up to each one of us to make our own evaluation, to find out what is the right— is this worth the price? Is this worth the cost? And as we get wiser and wiser, the answer is more and more, no, it's not worth the price, it's not

**Speaker B:** worth the cost, right?

**Speaker A:** Because it's too high. Let's find our gratifications at a discount.

**Speaker B:** Great, let's find it right here and right now.

**Speaker A:** Let's find it right here, right now, without having to do much of anything about it. So this whole quality then of breathing with the, uh, the tobacco is something that anyone who is quitting smoking should, um, let us say, practice in the sense that You can take the stogie or the pipe or the cigarette or whatever like that and do what you're going to do with it in all cases except set it on fire. This has been common. You were talking about your dad still is addicted to gum. Maybe what he could do instead is just carry a pack of cigarettes around, pull a cigarette out and play with that for a while. Put it in his mouth, suck on it. There's a little bit of tobacco that comes with even doing that. Just don't set it on fire. Make sure that he takes a puff, because most of the benefit of the smoking was taking deep breaths, and people are not getting that with the chewing of the gum.

**Speaker B:** Right, right. Well, it's funny. So a couple of things. So one is On the smoking, I feel like if I tried that method, let's say I had some cigars or cigarettes that I didn't smoke and I just tried puffing, I know myself and I know I would inevitably take out the lighter and light it. You know, I wouldn't be able to resist.

**Speaker A:** This is true, but the inevitable taking out the lighter, we give yourself the advantage of the inevitable. What is that? The time that it takes from the fact that you had the thought, I'm going to puff on this tobacco, without having to light it up. And when was that? 10 or 20 minutes before the inevitable— you lit it up. That was 10 minutes of safety.

**Speaker B:** Sure, sure.

**Speaker A:** So that's the whole idea then, is rather than thinking of it in terms of no, not now, forever, and making a great big thing. This is in fact what we mean by renunciation, okay? Renunciation is not the not now, it's the not ever. And we don't know about what the future is going to be. All we know is about what is happening right now. And so this is why the Buddha puts renunciation as an ordinary right view.

**Speaker B:** Interesting.

**Speaker A:** And people just say, wait a minute, how can that possibly be? Because, um, there's even Pali word for it, nakamma, renounce, to throw it out. Well, now wait a minute, let's look at how renunciation actually works. Normative renunciation is done in a ceremony. Normally renunciation is done as part of, let us say, joining an organization, like particularly the vow of celibacy for a priest, or a vow of poverty, or a vow of silence, which then puts the people on an extra, let us say, an extra list of rules to follow, more rules. That's what happens with renunciations, is we make a rule: thou shalt not have that tobacco. And so when we want it, now we feel bad. You should not want it. Not only can you not have it, but when you do want it, you're a bad person because you want to have it. Okay, and so this is what happens with the renunciation. It's much better to have the attitude of not right now, okay? That I can postpone the inevitable one more minute. I don't have to light that cigarette right now, right? That's where we look at it, is that that's why mindfulness is— in fact, we're looking at developing of mindfulness, when we can have the mindfulness of grabbing that lighter and just say, wait a minute, wait a minute, not now. So we put the lighter down and we continue to hold the cigarette without lighting it, taking another deep breath. Okay, so we take those deep breaths And we have to remember over and over again, this is what Sati is about. Sati is to remember what we're doing right here in this very moment, rather than Sati of remembering that I made a rule for myself.

**Speaker B:** Right. And just a few comments on Sati, and maybe questions. But so one is, I noticed that that the act of the— I've mentioned this to you before, I believe, but the act of noticing a hindrance, the aha, Mara, I see you, is very pleasurable. I really enjoy it when that happens.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's the whole point of it.

**Speaker B:** It's not even verbal anymore. I just notice and it brings me joy.

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker B:** And it's also interesting because sometimes I feel I will notice some unwholesome subtle quality of an experience that I can't even tell you what that quality was, but I notice it and I have the same aha, Mara, I see you sensation. So, you know, it might be I'm having a conversation with someone and I notice maybe the beginning of an unwholesome reaction, not even the reaction, just like a little shadow of a reaction. And I'll notice it and it'll broaden the mind when that happens, which is really interesting because I can't even tell you what the unwholesome thing actually was, just that I noticed it. But the other thing I was going to mention is it can be frustrating because I have days and sometimes, you know, like multiple days in a row where all of this is going great, you know, and then I have something like the quitting smoking or the shot or whatever, maybe just a bad day for who God knows what, and it just kind of like drops off a cliff, the Sati and all of this. And it's frustrating because what you want, what humans want, is this linear progression where it's just getting better every day. That's just not the way it works, you know, even with this I found. But I don't know, what are your thoughts on that? Maybe I'm doing it wrong.

**Speaker A:** Well, we started with that, that when we're under stress, that's, um, just like Murphy's Law for any electronic piece of equipment. And that is, is that when things are under stress, it's hard to remember. It's hard to remember that when you're up to your hips in alligators, it's hard to remember that your original intention was to drain the swamp, right? Okay, now that's a metaphor for every moment that we live. It's hard to remember to take a deep breath when I have all of these alligators of feelings of I need a tobacco fix.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, instead of recognizing, hey, wait a minute, these alligators are telling you something. They're telling you they're hungry, and you want them to be hungry. You want them to starve, right? Okay, so this is how we look at it now, is a different way, is to recognize that these things are so hard for Sati, so we have to practice well And the way that the Buddha talks about practicing— this is very subtle, but it is actually in the sutta spelled out in a way that when you really see it, it's profound, but most people read right over it. I see that, in fact, a lot in the suttas. One of the things that I saw in the sutras many years ago was the fact that the sutta is really, really hard to read. It's really, really hard to read because you're going to get some profound deep insight on the first page, and the second, third, and fourth page are really hard to read when you've just been floored by some profound point on the first page of the sutta. Right now I find that the sutta is easy. I mean, we can get through a sutta in about 10 or 15 minutes. Used to take 4 or 5 days, one insight a day. Okay, so in the suttas, in the Anapanasati Sutta, each one of the 16 stages is specified in kind of a poetic little phrase, and they substitute this word and that word as they go through. And most people will only go through and pick out this word and that word and this word and that word without recognizing that it's packed inside this tight little paragraph, this repeated over and over and over and over again. And when you recite this stuff with the monks in the chanting, that's what becomes apparent. It's the over and over and over point where just one word is being substituted. And so the things that are in that paragraph that are repeated over and over again is the point of that. Let's take an example which we've been already discussing a little bit today, and that is gladdening the mind. That we just— it's not that we gladden the mind as one of the things that we do. Rather, the gladdening of the mind, it says specifically, is a skill to be developed. Thus one trains oneself to mindfully breathe in long while gladdening the mind, and then thus one trains oneself to mindfully breathe out long while gladdening the mind. Okay, it doesn't just say gladden the mind, number 9, and do this, number 10, and do this, number 11. It always has this set phrase in there that gladdening the mind is to be done with full Sati, to remember to breathe in long while you're developing gladdening the mind, and to remember to breathe out long while we're gladdening the mind. Now, this is quite profound because most people don't get that sense of it. They think that in fact there's a lot of different objects, and one of the ways that is taught is in fact that the breathing is only just the first object, just for the very rank beginners. It's the first thing that they do. Once they get skills, they can leave the breath behind and go do other important things like noting.

**Speaker B:** Or

**Speaker A:** some nimitta or something like that. And then there's other statements about the breathing that indicate that there's a whole group of practitioners who do not practice according to Anapanasati. In fact, the

**Speaker B:** Bless you. Excuse me, have you been smoking?

**Speaker A:** No, just getting old, man, and talking too much.

**Speaker B:** Uh, got it.

**Speaker A:** Uh, The point we're looking at is that in fact the Mahasi Method and the Goenka Method, which is part of the Mahasi Method, as well as the Sri Lankans, the number one sutta that they look at and get their inspiration from is the Satipatthana Sutta. And yet everything that they need to do is in the Satipatthana Sutta. It's just kind of glossed over. The Satipatthana Sutta is actually kind of an overview, just like the Anapanasati is kind of an overview. And because some of the details are left out of the Satipatthana Sutta, those details then get left out of the entire teaching practice. Yipassana, she shuts shop.

**Speaker B:** So I have a question on that before we go on with this. So when I was at Swan Mook in 2013, and also in Ajahn Buddhadasa's book, the Manual for Anapanasati that I recently read, it's a very good book, they talked about the use of the nimitta. Do you ever go into that in your teaching? Or because it seems I've never heard you mention the Nimitta once, but I remember Dhamma Vinaya mentioning it at Swan Boat, and I also read it in the book. So I was curious to hear your thoughts on that whole practice.

**Speaker A:** The Nimitta itself was originally from the Kasina meditations that were common before the the enlightenment of the Buddha. The nimittas other than that are not mentioned anywhere in the suttas. The nimitta was not mentioned about breathing meditation until the 5th century AD in the Visuddhimagga. The Vasudhi Marga has had enormous influence in, let us say, modern Buddhism. The story is that when the British came to Southeast Asia, especially to Burma, that the Mahasi method and the new way of looking at Buddhism was a reaction to the Burmese reaction to Christianity invading. This mentality of the importance of the Vasudhi Marga had been there in many places, and Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was also influenced by it. But by the 1930s, he could begin to see holes in it. And he started talking about it. But it was still in the 1950s when he was talking about Anapanasati and would still have things in there. So it would be the older literature and some of the other stuff that he wasn't looking at. But Robert and I have had long conversations about to see that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, over the course of the years, came more and more into the suttas and what was actually in the suttas. And started to leave the newer literature, the Visuddhimagga, behind. Until by the time that I had become, let us say, knowledgeable of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, I met a monk in Bodhigaya who actually made a demonstration to me to indicate that he, and then later in Thailand Bhikkhuni and all of their followers, were, let us say, had fallen— the Visuddhimagga had fallen out of favor. At one point, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was known to have said that if you took the Visuddhimagga and the Abhidhamma and the commentaries and threw them into the ocean or burned them all up, that Buddhism would be better off.

**Speaker B:** Wow.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so this nematode was really there. Now, how the nematode actually operates when it's a real nematode is that you take a kasina, which is an object that's about, let us say, the size of a dinner plate. It's normally made out of mud or leaves, and because it's made out of mud with little rocks and stones and things like that, or it's made out of leaves, which means you have the the veins of the leaves and the various colorations and things like that, that you look at this object and then you close your eyes and try to recreate the object as best you can. This takes enormous focus. And so they open their eyes over and over again and re-establish the details of a particular area. Then they close their eyes and see if they can remember that exactly. This is the quality of the nimitta. Now basically that can be done with the breathing. If you focus on the nose tip right here, then you can feel the touch between the breaths. The nimitta will be not the sensation that your breathing creates. When you are breathing, the air goes in and that touches the skin and causes a sensation, and then you breathe out. And that same touch of sensation is there because the movement of the air. But after you breathe out, can you still feel that touch or that sensation? When you can still feel it, that's the nematode, okay? That's what the nematode is. Is the nematode useful? The answer to that is it depends upon what your nematode is. And those kind of nimittas that get the mind focused may not be as useful. And in fact, it goes against what's in the suttas. The sutta never talks about nose tip. But even in the Visuddhimagga, it's not talked about as nose tip. In fact, the word that's used is cave. Now, what is a cave? Can the cave be the nostrils, inside the nostrils? How about inside the mouth if the mouth is open? How about is it a cave if the mouth is closed? Well, we're talking about breathing. Perhaps the cave that they're talking about in this letter literature is not mouth or nose or anything. It's the cave of the chest. When you're breathing in, you open and expand, and it's a cave. When you breathe out, the cave contracts. So the cave is expanding and contracting. Paying attention to that is what is in the suttas— paying attention to the breath body. Which could then be used as the cave. So possibly this nose tip stuff and the nematode is all just bad translations. So, but it is completely unnecessary for practicing First Jhana and is never mentioned in that regard. That in fact, all of the information about nose tips and nematodes and all of that kind of stuff is 1,000 years after the Buddha. But Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, because of his training and whatnot, included that stuff. But it was only later when he began to move it out. And the book that he— that was done, that Anapanasati book, where he's still talking about the Nembuttā, is in the late 1980s. So yes, he did continue to talk about that, but that it's not really part of the sutta, is not really necessary. And that it's— this also goes for this, that the nimitta of the breath has a value for a particular practice, and that's not what our primary practice is. The primary practice that we need to do, and it's talked about in the sutras in many different regards, the first thing is The first jhana. The way that we're talking about the first jhana is that the Buddha first off in Sutta number 36 talks about that the real path to enlightenment is the first jhana. And he said that after he had been expert in all of the jhanas. The next point is that in the suttas, an example would be Sutta number 111, where the Buddha is talking about Arahant Bhikkhuni, his practice, they spend a really big, big long paragraph talking about the first Jhana, including what it is, how to get into it, and what's to be done while one is in there. Then the second, the third, the fourth jhanas. Are just kind of additions to it, almost as if someone came up in the book later and made these additions to it. But even with those new additions to it, still the primary teaching is about the first Jhana. The nimitta has the quality of the higher jhanas in the sense that Guarding the breath is good for going into the second Jhana, and then from the second to the third Jhana is where this nimitta is really useful. It's for the higher jhanas. I remember talking about that to Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. It may have been that in the translation, either Sure, uh, Sankhara missed what Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was saying, or Bhikkhu Buddhadasa kind of slept over it. But when, when you and I are talking about it and you ask me a direct question, I— we can go into the details of it.

**Speaker B:** Sure. Okay.

**Speaker A:** And the details of it is that yes, there is some value for the nose tip, but right now is not that time. We've got better important— we've got a whale to fry, and that's the Menno.

**Speaker B:** Sure. So quick, so one other question on that is, and not to focus too much on the Nibbana or whatever, but why do you think Dhammarato may have talked about it in 2013 when I was there? And it was a while ago, so, you know, I don't remember this precise specifics, but I do remember him kind of giving an introduction to the whole nimitta and talking about it, etc. And if it wasn't important for Bhikkhu Buddhadasa by the time he kind of completed his teaching, why would Dhammavirtu spend time, you know, expounding upon it, etc.?

**Speaker A:** Okay, one point, and I'm not even sure that this point is relevant, but it's one piece of information that I do have, and that is that Dhammavirtu only arrived at Wat Suwan Mokkh at that particular time. So that's when he arrived, and he did not have the detailed kind of conversations with

**Speaker B:** Anagami, uh, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa.

**Speaker A:** He missed those. All he had was the written literature and other monks to talk to. Okay, so that could have something, uh, to do with it. The other one is, is that if Bhikkhuni does teach about the nose tip, then that's okay for Dhammarato in the setting that he is in to talk about it also. The reason that I don't talk about it is because I haven't met many students, or any students at all, who were really needing that or ready for it.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** And so it's an unneeded, unnecessary teaching that if I found a student that I thought would be— would benefit from that, then I would teach it. But in fact, teaching the mantras or going into the higher Jhanas is better than using the Nematta. But in fact, many people who were going to use the Nemetta will use both the Nemetta and a mantra. An example of that would be Budo. Bu on the in-breath and do on the out-breath. Focusing just on the air moving in and out. And you can see that at the end of the, uh, when you do bu on the in-breath and do on the out-breath, and that's all you're thinking, those— that's the whole thought for your entire in-breath and out-breath, was a bu on the in and do on the out. That means that going into the space between the bu-do and the next bu-do can stretch out. Okay, and so this is where we get the mind very quiet, very silent, is by working more with the Mantra than where the mind is focused. That you can actually focus right here and get into the Second Jhana without having to do the Nimitta. So the things then we look at then is that the Nimitta itself, the way that they use it is very late, does not follow the suttas. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was moving out of that over time anyway, and therefore, uh, is also for an advanced training technique that's given too early. Now that's an especially important point because that's what I find that is the biggest problem with Western Buddhism, is they want the whole show. In other words, the first graders of Buddhism in Western Buddhism, they want PhD dissertations to read. They're not, they're not good with Dick and Jane. Dick and Jane, they don't want. They can read Dick and Jane, they can understand Dick and Jane, but they want PhD research papers.

**Speaker B:** I have a funny story about that I think you'll like. So, uh, so when I was a kid like in elementary school, we had this program called Accelerated Reading or whatever, and you could read books, you would take a little quiz on the computer and you would get points. So I found out what book in the library would get the most possible points. The reason I did was because if our table won the most points for a month, we would get a pizza party. So not a pity party, a pizza party, you know, better than pity party. So the opposite. So anyway, I found out the book in the library with the most points was Robinson Crusoe. And I was like in the 3rd grade or something. And so I went to go read it and it was completely impenetrable to me. You know, it's like a 19th century English and I'm a 3rd grader. So instead I went and I rented the movie, and I watched the movie. The movie wasn't much better, but I still got some stuff out of it. And I went and I took the exam, and I got 50%, but the book was worth so many points that that 50% was worth more than all the other people in the whole class got. So even though I failed the thing, because it was 50% of a lot, I got a ton of points. We got the pizza party, and then the day of the pizza party, I got in trouble for something and I wasn't allowed to go to my own pizza party that I won for our thing. So that was the— I thought you'd like that story.

**Speaker A:** But well, it is an important story to recognize that there's a famous saying, and that is that our reach extends our grasp. Or let us say that we can touch something, but grabbing a hold of it is different than just merely reaching it. That we can reach it, but our grasp is not— you get what I'm talking about?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. That we can touch things, but we can't grab them. And so that's what you were doing with that Robinson Crusoe book, was that you could not grab it, but you could touch it, right? Okay, this is what we look at in Buddhism, is that people who are trying to grab things that they can't, they merely touch it, and they think that that's the success, when in fact we need to actually grab hold of it, especially in the sense of really grabbing a hold of the mind. Grabbing a hold of the mind and grabbing a hold of the breath is the whole point. And exactly how we do that is just a mere detail. So if we're really, really grabbing a hold of the breath, then that means that we can control it— long, deep in-breaths. And whether we're guarding the breath at the nose tip and creating the nimitta or whether we're just watching the breath in general, the important point is, is that both of those are successful because they're doing the primary ingredient of actually grasping and taking a hold of the breath and learning to control it, as opposed to the Mahayana method of just merely watch the breath, which is a much more passive activity. So In that case, Dhammavitu is absolutely correct. He's teaching a higher Dharma than merely watching the breath, that he's going actually too far into it and taking the students beyond their ability to grasp hold of the breath, because this is an advanced technique. Now they can build up to it. This is what we would recommend. And so I think that in ways he's actually just kind of mentioning that, that he's not certainly not going to be talking about it on the first day of a retreat.

**Speaker B:** No, no, I think it was day 3 or day 4 that he brought it in. So by then, you know, the people that knew what they were doing had already gotten to a point of concentration where they could probably deal with it. I wasn't there yet, this is my first retreat ever.

**Speaker A:** That's another issue that you're bringing up here, and that is that the problem with meditation retreats like that that's open to a large number of people, the retreat settings, especially the Goenka— I really started to see that in the Goenka retreats while I was there— and that is that the Goenka retreats themselves are always geared just for the beginners. So taking the Goenka retreat one after the other, after the other, after the other, after the other, you begin to get get the foundation of what he's talking about, but that's all you're going to get. Listen, the reason that I left Goenka was because I recognized deep inside that he was missing something. It wasn't that he just wasn't teaching something, it was that he didn't get it himself. There was something that he was missing, and it was only when I got into Bhikkhu Buddhadasa when I started to put together exactly what it was that he was missing. Now, over time, in reading Mahasi literature and all of that kind of stuff, I'm beginning to see where both Goenka and Mahasi is missing some really key ingredients that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was able to know. And the question is, did Bhikkhuni figure this stuff out for himself, or did he have teachers? The answer was he had teachers. He had his own teachers. We know who the teacher was, uh, Bhikkhu Buddhaghosa Jhana. And Bhikkhuni was the Samadhi of Thailand. He was, I mean, way up there, like the, the king. The word Sangharaj means the king of the monks. Sangharaj, the king of the Sangha. And that his teacher was actually part of the member of the royal family of Thailand, Puja. So Puja actually disrobed to become king for a short period of time. And so this noble lineage of Thailand is somewhat closely related to the royal family, and this is the lineage that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was in of royalty, and we have some fairly good evidence of what happened back then in the 1930s because he was accused of a sangha decessa. Now, the word sangha decessa means to break the Sangha.

**Speaker B:** You can see the word 'deceit.'

**Speaker A:** And the outcome of that— won't go into much detail— but the outcome of it was that he was accused and then convicted or sentenced with, uh, that he's teaching the right Dharma to the wrong people, right? That was the sentence, okay? This came down from the entire council, that he's teaching the right Dharma to the wrong people.

**Speaker B:** A question: what exactly was he teaching that caused so much uproar?

**Speaker A:** I would say that there was kind of a list, but at the top of the list, what he was teaching was emptiness, Sunyata, and Anatta. And that he would go so far, I think, that in fact, The way that it was handled at Wat Soen Mokkh for many, many years, when people would want to come and talk about magic or powers or rebirth or reincarnation and that kind of stuff, the typical answer was, oh, we don't talk about that kind of stuff here. We're more interested in the actual liberating teachings of the Dhamma, and none of that stuff is liberating. But if you want to, there's monks and walk down the road someplace there, and you can go down there and talk to them about it if you want to talk about it. But here we're not interested in stuff that's irrelevant, okay? So that's basically, uh, the point then, is that he was teaching that stuff into the far distant future or in the deep past is irrelevant. And that goes directly against the teachings of Christianity and the teachings of ordinary Buddhism, sir, right? That, oh no, you are your past. That the Buddha actually says you inherit your own Kamma, right? But people think that that means that you inherit your own— the results of your actions 3 or 400 years or 10,000 years after you commit the events, so rather than recognizing that you are heir to your karma of your actions right now— if you stick your hand in the fire right now, it will get burned right now. That's the teaching of the Buddha, and this is the teaching that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was on about that got him into trouble.

**Speaker B:** Got it. So I have a question. So I love talking about this stuff and just talking about it is very inspiring. And one challenge in my practice has been, like, for example, one thought I had while we were talking about this stuff is to read more of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's book, The Heartwood of the Bodhi Tree, which I started, but I haven't dug as much into it lately.

**Speaker A:** That's a bear, isn't it? We're talking about reading a book that's too far beyond us. You think that one takes anybody 3 or 4 book times to read that book?

**Speaker B:** Oh, it's a good one, and I'm only at the introduction, and I really enjoyed it. Yeah, so anyhow, and I also want to read the Void Mind book that Keshon mentioned. That's also on my list. But it's funny because I— oh, sorry, go ahead.

**Speaker A:** I spend a lot of time with students talking about that particular one. Do things with a void mind. Now, normally the word void gives people the wrong idea from the beginning, so we have to understand that what we're talking about is void means that it's void of unwholesome thoughts, not void of all thoughts, right?

**Speaker B:** So, so the reason— so you do

**Speaker A:** things with that, avoid— with a mind that's void means that you can do the activity. I mean, many people You cannot operate a computer without thinking, right? But you can operate a computer while thinking wholesomely. But most people operate the computer thinking unwholesomely. And so this is the point about the void mind, is to do what you will. In fact, this is a little poem that he wrote that's difficult for most people to understand. Is that we think that all renunciation means that I have to withdraw from doing the things. But a real renunciation inside is to withdraw from the feelings that I have when I do those things.

**Speaker B:** Right. And that's the biggest thing that I got out of reading the Bhagavad Gita. Is they are very explicit about that in there. That's the best thing about that book as far as I'm concerned, and it's been very useful for me even though I haven't fully gotten it, or I'm not even halfway. But just knowing it's out there, it was useful. And but I was going to say one thing that was interesting is, you know, I'm very inspired when we have our conversations. Always the day after, I feel great. I'm all about the practice, then I notice something will come along, you know, drop off a cliff, you know, and, you know, I don't know, what are your thoughts on that? How can I stop that from happening? Just keep at it, you know, and eventually it'll stop, you know?

**Speaker A:** Yes, if you're talking about dropping off a cliff, which means that all of a sudden the Sati is gone, the thrill is gone.

**Speaker B:** Right. That's part of it, is the thrill too. That's part of it, is like I get used to doing the practice and it brings me joy. There's even a little bit of a thrill in it. And then I get— maybe you could call it bored of the practice almost, you know, is like I've listened to a lot of your videos. I listened to the whole top video playlist and I just started your series with Danny. By the way, I listened to them on 2x. So I go twice as fast as, you know, but I enjoy doing that. It's nice. And anyway, so it's a great series with Danny, by the way. I've been really enjoying that one. And it's inspired some other conversations I'll bring up with you later. But, you know, and I find, you know, a lot of enjoyment in that. But I also find that after a certain point, It's like I've listened to too much, you know, or I've practiced too, and then the excitement diminishes. It might be because of the physiological stress of quitting, because it did this most recent time coincide with that. But I believe it's also happened at times where I haven't had a particular stress, but I've just gotten a little tired of thinking about the practice.

**Speaker A:** Let's take a different view for it just a moment. Yeah, and that is, is that,

**Speaker B:** um, the—

**Speaker A:** let's use the analogy of the student practicing the piano. Okay, what happens the moment, or the, uh, 30 seconds, or the 10 seconds before he quits practicing?

**Speaker B:** Uh, he decides to quit. Like he's kind of tired. He's like, you know, I've had enough here.

**Speaker A:** So his mind is no longer on the music. Now his mind is upon how he feels, right? Okay, here's where we're coming from now, and that is, is that, um, you're practicing Sati to keep the hindrances away, and then one hindrance will come up, one thought, a hindering thought that comes up, and now it takes over and you quit. Okay, this is the kind of time— that's the point in time, that moment in time— is when you need Sati the most, is how to sustain this. Getting into that state and then learning how to sustain it means now we're on guard for the very kind of thoughts that would be in a sequence for you to go back into ordinary bad feelings. You have to be on guard for those. What kind of thoughts will it be that throw you out of your good space so that you can come back immediately and redouble your efforts, put the right effort back into it and say no. Not yet. We're going to have some more joy. Thank you very much. I'm glad I caught that. I'm glad I caught the mind wandering away again because it's going to carry me out. Okay, so this is the new part of the new skills to be developed, is not just getting oneself into a good state, but to be able to maintain that. This is the right— this is what's

**Speaker B:** really the big problem for me. Yep, we've hit the nail on the head. I'm totally fine at getting into a good state. That's not a problem, but it's maintaining it is really the problem, you know.

**Speaker A:** And so being on guard with that, with the intention of, I'm going to catch those kind of thoughts that pull me out of feeling good, right? And be on guard for those. Whack that cow.

**Speaker B:** Sure, sure. And you know, it's funny, I find there's about 4 different, actually really 3 different types of thoughts that seem to dominate my mind throughout the day. So one we've discussed a lot, but we can still keep discussing it because it's inexhaustible, which is I need to do this or I need to do that. "Or I need to plan out this," or superego stuff. That's number one. Number two is thoughts of an ex-girlfriend or ex-love interest. And that kind of thing comes up a lot for me. And I know it's useless. I know there's no point, and I do return to my practice, but it still comes up. It's like a scab that just won't heal, you know.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's more like a little secret pleasure.

**Speaker B:** It is to some extent, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And there's two in particular that keep coming up.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And in fact, picking at a scab can be a particular pleasure.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that's very true. Okay.

**Speaker A:** So we have to give that credit. We have to be able to see the gratification. Because if we can't see the gratification, then it's going to be difficult to make the value judgment about the cost-benefit analysis. So you have to see the gratification as well as the danger. Okay, now there was a There is an actual very good story of an event that happened between Ajahn Samadhi and Ajahn Chah.

**Speaker B:** I've heard this one. Yep, right.

**Speaker A:** So let's go to it. When you have thoughts of girls, it's okay to have thoughts of girls. They're delicious, they're beautiful, they're enticing, they're lovely, but I don't want one. This is the way to begin to recognize it is okay to have those thoughts, but that you're not about to go act upon it because you can see the dangers are not associated necessarily with the thoughts, because those are just lovely thoughts. But when those thoughts turn into desire, not only do I have to think about her, but I got to call her. Right now we're getting off into dangerous territory, right? Okay, right. So this is how we have to understand that, yes, you can give yourself credit for giving yourself pleasure. There's no wrong— nothing wrong with the pleasure, but we have to recognize what the dangers are that go along with those pleasures.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** But here you are with your Anicca, now you're into renunciation and the, um, superego mind state is saying, you should not be thinking about girls. And deep inside there, that little child inside saying, I like it, I like it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, it's very true.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so give yourself credit for the fact that you do like it, but now you can change it from renunciation in that, oh, you should not be thinking about girls, you should be enjoying enjoying myself right now? The answer is, well, I am enjoying myself right now, and I'm going to do it safely and harmlessly because that's all it is, is just thought. So that's the easy way for you to begin to deal with that, is to recognize, yeah, it's okay to have those thoughts. I mean, let's face it, our chemistry is a deep, deep part of us. That attraction, sexual attraction between men and women, is built right into the DNA. It's natural. And yet most of the religious people that I know of are trying to deny that natural part of them by making rules about it. And that's why the Catholic Church, for instance, have two major problems. The Catholic Church has number one major problem of being exposed and getting caught for, um, the, the activities that the priests are having with young people. But there's another problem that the Catholic Church has had to deal with for a long time, and that is the medical issues of prostate cancer. Yeah, prostate cancer is widespread in celibate groups.

**Speaker B:** Wow, didn't know that.

**Speaker A:** You know why?

**Speaker B:** It's, it's kind of like the most useless type of cancer though, isn't it? Like it takes 20 years to kill someone.

**Speaker A:** Well, right, so it's 20 years of self-pity, denial, trying to keep a vow that goes against our nature, right? And so what we need to do is to kind of go with the nature up to the point of when it gets dangerous, okay? So in New York as well as here on the island Everywhere the cosmetic industry has been able to infiltrate the minds of the women to tell them always, you're not beautiful without our product. You are missing something. You're just a female. But with our makeup, Maxine, Max Factor will say, you can be a gorgeous female.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And so women are working really hard to make themselves look attractive. We should give them credit for all the work that they put in. I mean, this beautiful girl right here has got $15 worth of makeup and it took her 2 hours to apply it. Let's give her credit for her makeup. But I am not about to fall in love with a makeup package.

**Speaker B:** Yes, sir.

**Speaker A:** That the painted face is beautiful and I like that paint, but I don't want the face. You see where we're coming from with this, okay? That it's okay to give people credit for the beautification that they're making and allow themselves to be beautiful. But just because I like what they look like doesn't mean that I want it, that I'm already okay, and that I can appreciate it. In fact, the winner is the one who can really appreciate another winner. Losers can't appreciate another winner because they are too jealous. But a real winner— so if you're really on top of your game and you really feel good about yourself, then you can allow these beautiful girls to be really beautiful without wanting them.

**Speaker B:** Sure. So one question about the celibacy that you mentioned. You know, there's been a lot of talk about, you know, and you see a lot of this stuff like on Reddit or whatever, you know, about the power of celibacy and how celibacy is good for your practice and this and that. You know, what's your take on that? Do you think that's just wrong or do you think there's some truth to it? You know, what's your view on that? Hello? Hello, are you there? Hello? Oh, hello, are you there?

**Speaker A:** Okay, you're back. All right, good. I was just checking. No, my internet's still working, so it must have been on your In any case, just go back to where you were. What did the last thing that you heard?

**Speaker B:** So I asked about celibacy and how, you know, you can read on the internet about how celibacy helped people with their practice and all this energy, and you know, they reserve.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** You know, see and all of this, you know. So what's your take on that whole—

**Speaker A:** Okay, so I was about to talk about, within the context of Western Buddhism, the Western mind is highly influenced by the original religions of the culture. And so the Western mind is heavily influenced by Christianity And that is hard for most people to understand, that celibacy of priests— actually, there's nothing to do with celibacy. It has everything to do with marriage. And it has everything to do with marriage because starting in the 11th century, there were enough priests who had enough bastard kids who, when they grew up and dad died, the child was able to take over the church property. And so the Catholic Church had brought about celibacy to keep the priests from marrying so that they could continue to control their property. This actually happens in other cultures too. It happened in Korea, that if the Korean monks or the Koreans, uh, priests or whoever who was running the temple, if he had a child, then the possibility of nepotism, that when that old man died, the new child, his child becomes the leader or the abbot or whatever of the temple. That's not possible within the Theravada tradition because one has to be a monk of 20 years to become an abbot. But in other traditions, that was why They didn't want priests to get married is because of the ownership of the property. Okay, but where, uh, the whole teaching of the Buddha has to do with freedom— freedom is the issue. Okay, right. And, um, in that regard, that if you don't, uh, if you're very, very wise, you can set up your relationships so that you still have freedom. But mostly the easiest way is to be unencumbered so that you have complete freedom. Now, there is a sutta where the Buddha talks to lay people where he recommends for the lay followers that they give up all of the business and household duties to the wife. Let her be the boss. We let her do what she wants to do. We give advice and consent and that kind of thing, but basically this is what has made Thailand a matriarchal culture, is because of the Buddha's advice. The old men recognize, hey, I don't have to work anymore. I can sit at home and let my wife do all the work. And I can just take it easy and have a relaxed, easy life and spend my time thinking about and talking about the Dharma and not have to worry about it. So this is another way of having freedom. And you see, that kind of freedom then has nothing to do with celibacy. It has to do with attachments, it has to do with time constraints and other things like this. And so just getting away from it all is basically what we're talking about here. And yet that desire that we have inside that comes from our DNA— and there is more to it than just DNA. Let's look at it from another perspective. Let us say that you had two different tribes. Who did some intermarriage and some intermingling so that they eventually became one tribe. Except that this original first tribe over here on the right hand were very highly oversexed. They talked about sex, they thought about sex, they danced in front of each other for sex and all kinds of other stuff. But the other group just naturally were not interested in sex. Nobody cared about sex. Nobody dressed up. Nobody dressed down. Sex was not an issue. You bring these two together and guess who is going to have the most babies? The people of a mixed marriage, the people who have both husband and wife who were oversexed. And then we have the group of people who the wife and the husband, neither one of them care about sex. Which group is going to have children the most?

**Speaker B:** Well, the oversexed.

**Speaker A:** The primitives. Precisely. This is the society where you came from. The most likely is, is that your parents were oversexed, that the people, that their parents were oversexed, and the parents before that were oversexed. On the other side of the, the camp, all of those children of people who were not oversexed, they were not oversexed, and eventually there's not so many of them.

**Speaker B:** Right, right.

**Speaker A:** So that, that's the way of, uh, what, of, of humans understanding that humans are way oversexed.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** Way beyond what our actual biology would call for. It's part of our culture, as part of our tradition, but most specifically is part of our DNA.

**Speaker B:** Sure. So one other thing on the celibacy I think has influenced a lot of people in the modern West is the whole Brahmacharya phenomenon in India. You know, like Gandhi talked a lot about the Brahmachari practice. Are you familiar with this Brahmacharya?

**Speaker A:** Way too much.

**Speaker B:** Way too much. Yeah. So what's your take on that whole whole deal?

**Speaker A:** Uh, I would put that part of it into the area of religion, into the area of mythology, into the area of promise. If you do without sex for long enough, you will be awarded these powers, right?

**Speaker B:** Right. It's like, okay, who is the— who

**Speaker A:** is the authorizing authority that's going to give those powers. More than likely what's going to happen is if you do without sex while thinking about sex and denying yourself sex, you're going to have the power of prostate cancer, right?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** That's what really is going to happen, not what they're promising you, right?

**Speaker B:** Well, part of the teaching though is also you're not even supposed to think about it. But you know, if you think about thinking about it, you're thinking about it, right?

**Speaker A:** Right. And guess what? They can't stop thinking about it, and you know that because you don't stop thinking about it, right?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Well, in fact, young men, I would say about two-thirds of their thoughts are sex. Yeah, old men, they're down to about one-third of their thoughts for sex.

**Speaker B:** The better way to be, you know. But so I, I gotta say too, uh, you know, it's funny, or it's funny, Anagami— I read a spiritual biography of Gandhi. It was a great book. And he actually believed that there was a massive earthquake in India, in Mumbai, during his whole campaign for Satyagraha, you know, for independence for India. And he believed that if he had undertaken brahmacharya earlier, that never would have happened. I think that's absurd, but I don't know, I'm curious to hear your thoughts on that.

**Speaker A:** Magical thinking.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it was also Gandhi, you know, he's a great teacher, you know, but

**Speaker A:** okay, all right, so Gandhi's capable of magical thinking. Wasn't Jesus capable of magical thinking? I mean, he drove the money changers out of the temple, you know. If he'd have thought about it better, he could have gone in and eventually over time with careful detail he could have made friends with Caiaphas and then convinced Caiaphas, uh, himself that the money changers didn't belong in the temple. They could go out on the courtyard, right? So Jesus could have handled that whole thing wholesomely, but he didn't,

**Speaker B:** right?

**Speaker A:** He had low-class thoughts about it. So just because Gandhi had some low-class thoughts doesn't mean that we have to throw him out completely, because he had some good high-class thoughts too. We can think of Gandhi the same way that we think of the girl who's got her face all painted up with $10 worth of Maybelline, right? Yeah, he's hard to beat. You got to give him credit for it.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** But we can also be realistic in the sense of, yes, there are some things, and no, there are another, uh, that in fact wanting spiritual power is the greed that is so strong in some people that they will actually give up their sexuality in order to get, or just have the promise of it. Okay, and so we can see, because we have widespread, uh, not just in our time but over many, many centuries, we have lots and lots and lots of evidence of people doing well or mediocrely at practicing the renunciation of celibacy? How many of those priests flap their arms and fly out of their priestly quarters, out of their cathedral? How many priests do you see floating in the air above the altar? Arya doesn't happen. Yep, doesn't happen. We have literally hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of examples of people who have practiced celibacy for the long term, for many years, some of them being very, very good at it, very great at it, and others being mediocre. But in all cases, no power. In all cases, no power. And so what they do is, is, oh, I wasn't celibate long enough. If I had only started my celibacy long sooner, I would be flying now, right?

**Speaker B:** I mean, you know, the big counter-argument of course is Gandhi, right? You know, and he had great power, you know, not like magic powers, but like he had a great, you know, force of personality, you know.

**Speaker A:** And I think Donald Trump has a great force of personality.

**Speaker B:** Not like Gandhi's, you know.

**Speaker A:** Like Gandhi— how do you know it's not like Gandhi?

**Speaker B:** Well, well, he does. Okay, Donald Trump does have a great force of personality, but Gandhi's was noble, so it had like a much more

**Speaker A:** refined— all right, but you didn't talk about noble. You didn't talk about noble. You didn't talk about noble. You talked about force of personality. As if that was a magical power. That's what you said.

**Speaker B:** Sure, sure.

**Speaker A:** Okay, people have force of, uh, personal power, of dynamism, of lying to people, of convincing them to do things, to follow, to vote, all kinds of things that are ordinary power, not magical power, right? And yet people are practicing celibacy not for ordinary power No one says, oh, I've been celibate, that's why I'm so charismatic. In fact, the guys who get charismatic get charismatic because they're trying to chat up girls. They learn how to be charismatic to get what they want.

**Speaker B:** Sure, totally.

**Speaker A:** So charisma has nothing to do with magical powers.

**Speaker B:** So, so another question or comment or whatnot. So, you know, I find that a lot of my life is concerned with getting power, you know, whether it's like working out, you know, or like physical power, or it's, you know, job, you know, career, this and that, you know, or even meditation to some extent, you know, is pursuit of power, you know. And it's like Nietzsche, you know, and that, you know, spoke about how we're all— all human beings are just driven by the will to power, you know, no matter what.

**Speaker A:** There's a better way of looking at it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, we're not driven by the will to power, we're driven about thoughts of fear, and we want the power because if we feel like that we're powerful, then that will help mollify our fear.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** If someone has no fear, if they feel secure They have a kind of power that the Pradhi cat only wants and doesn't have. This is the real power that comes from a correct practice of Anapanasati, is the right attitude that I can in fact clean out my mind, the right attitude of I'm on top of this, I can handle anything. Now that's real power. To where people who are still dealing with fear and want power, they're wanting some sort of physical manifestation of power that they can grasp hold of. So they're looking for magical power mostly. And so the greed for magical power is old, it's common. People spend a lot of time, a lot of energy. You wouldn't believe how much, let us say, human man-hours or, uh, whatnot during the Middle Ages was spent on alchemy.

**Speaker B:** A lot. I mean, even Isaac Newton, like, he spent half his career on physics and the other half on alchemy.

**Speaker A:** On alchemy, right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And it's— he could have accomplished so much more if he just stepped— stayed to the physics. I mean, he accomplished way more than anyone else ever will, but most likely. But still, maybe he could have done double what he did had he had that time from the Anagami.

**Speaker A:** We don't know those kind of things, but we do know that people want power because they think that they need it. And why would they need the power unless for protection? Themselves. And when you don't need any protection for one reason or another— and one of the reasons to not need any protection is because you're not trying to protect the self anymore. The self is not important so much. Here's myself, have at it, shoot it all you want, you know, anything you want to about who I am, because I'm not that. Whoever you're complaining about, that's not me. So if we come to that position, is, is that the reason that I I don't need any power is because I'm not afraid. And the reason that I'm not afraid is because the target is safe. The reason the target is safe is because it's not a fixed target that can be hit. It's a moving target.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** You know, so if you're a moving target, then you're safe.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So I got two little Two little stories or soliloquies that I think you'll appreciate. So one is this morning I was reading the news that the leader of Boko Haram was killed, which is this terrible terrorist organization in Nigeria. And so I read the obituary of him because it was just for whatever reason, you know, I was there. And it talked about how, you know, He was the terrorist leader for like 12 years or something like that, I think since 2009, so yeah, 12 years. And he got to be so paranoid and whatnot that his entire area where he lived was just filled with landmines and traps and every type of killing, defense mechanism that he could have, he would put surrounding him. And the only way they were able to get him was because some of his lieutenants turned on him. So they were able to infiltrate his compound. And it made me think, our little conversation just a minute ago, of— I remember reading several years back about the King of Jordan. And the King of Jordan has a lot of power, but I don't think he's an absolute monarch. But I think he just has a lot of power. And one thing I read about him is that the closer the family member is to the king, the closer they are to the center of the family, the less they think the king should have any power. So, you know, the cousin of the king thinks the king should have a good amount of power. The king's wife thinks the king should be a constitutional monarch. The king thinks he should be a constitutional monarch. The brother, you know, more middle situation, but the further off, you know, the random person thinks the king should have all the power, but the king himself doesn't, you know. So it's kind of interesting because it's exactly what you're saying about how, you know, if you actually have the power, you don't even care about having the power, or you might even not want it because you're not afraid, you know. And so, so the king of Jordan doesn't even want it, you know, whereas this terrorist guy was living in a hell of his own creation, you know, a complete hell by having all this power that he accumulated over the years. So I don't know, I thought you'd— yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well, there's another story called The Prince and the Pauper. I think that in fact they made an opera out of it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, we've talked about this one.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right. And the little kid who was a street urchin, he was doing just great, and he was discovered to be the prince, and so they put him in the palace with guards and all of that, and he hated it, and he escaped. He didn't like the fact that, that, uh, the palace was dangerous. That's why you have palace guards. If people got money, they need to protect it. If you don't have any money, you don't need to protect it, right? That's freedom. If you own a bunch of stuff, that means that you've got to be— you, in a way, you can say that, uh, anything that you own owns you. If you own a house, that means that that house depends upon you to take care of it. If you rent a house Now the landlord is the one who has to take care of the house. You don't have to take care of it anymore. You just live in the house, and if something is broken, it doesn't get fixed. You don't have to fix it. It's up to the landlord to fix it, right? If you own that house, you've got to fix it yourself. Sure. So it's better not to own property, because if you own property, the property owns you. And every toilet, every time the toilet breaks up or, uh, clogs up or something, guess what? You've got work to

**Speaker B:** do. So this brings us back to renunciation, right? So, so the renunciation, like, there's a lot of power in that, you know, in a sense, because nothing's tying you down. You fully renounce.

**Speaker A:** Oh, you're talking about renunciation in a different way than I'm talking about it. When I'm talking about renunciation, I'm talking about the idea of planning in the future to not do it. A vow, like the vow of poverty that the priest takes upon, you know, the ceremony upon the time that he becomes a priest or whatever like that, is when he takes the vow. Sure, year after year, day after day later, that he has to deal with that vow, right? And so the whole point that we're talking about renunciation has to do with the vow itself, as opposed to the wisdom of noticing, for instance, right now is not a good day to buy a house. And then tomorrow I come by and I say, right now, today is not a good day to buy a house, as opposed to renouncing ownership, right? Not now, not ever is— that's way off into the future. That means that now we're setting a rule about the future. But if we can see right now, it's not a good idea to buy the house. Today is not a good idea about the house, and I don't have to renounce it.

**Speaker B:** So what do you think of the Buddha, you know, who's so famous for renouncing the world?

**Speaker A:** He didn't renounce the world. That's the story, right?

**Speaker B:** Is he— first he did, and then he walked the Middle Way, which was not actually path of renunciation entirely.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right. Renunciation is not a middle path, it's an extreme. Not now is a middle path, not ever is extreme.

**Speaker B:** Sure. So do you feel like— I'm sure you do, but do you feel like you're, you're walking the middle path right now? You know, like, do you ever miss the robes?

**Speaker A:** I'm sitting.

**Speaker B:** I'm sitting, I should say. Yeah, you know, because I feel like the notion of the middle path, like, that would be— the goalposts kind of change for that, right? Like, the middle path to someone— actually,

**Speaker A:** the middle path is when you don't have extremes like goalposts. The goal is to have no goalposts. Goals are always at the extreme. You're always on the middle path when you don't have any goals, because the goal is either way over there or way over

**Speaker B:** there.

**Speaker A:** Got no goals, here you are, no place to

**Speaker B:** go. Interesting. So, you know, another thing that, that, that was interesting is, you know, I really enjoyed my retreat at Swan Mook, and I'd love to go back someday, hopefully somewhat soon, you know, depending on the whole COVID and everything. I remember listening to one of the videos with Danny, and he talked about how he didn't have such a good time there. I don't know if he ever went back or not after that video, but is Dhamma Vidu still teaching there? Are they still doing it the way they used to do it?

**Speaker A:** Like in 2013, I think that he was still doing retreats at the International Dharma Hermitage. Now he spends— in fact, I think that He either spends half or all of his time at Deepabhavana, and when he's teaching, he's teaching at Deepabhavana, which is on the island which is where Ajahn Poh stays. So Ajahn Poh is staying at Deepabhavana, and that's where Dhammavitu is teaching. However, I don't think that they're doing anything because of COVID right now, but they'll open back up soon enough. But right now they're between things, so everything is easygoing, nothing's happening.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, that's good. Yeah, but yeah, hopefully I'll get out there sometime. But does Deepo Bhavana do retreats?

**Speaker A:** Uh, Wat Khao Tom, uh, Indira, the International Dharma Hermitage, all of those do retreats. The International Dharma Hermitage is the one who does most of them in Thai, but Deepavuwan does Thai retreats

**Speaker B:** also. Uh, I thought the International Dharma Heart Heritage one that was in English when I went.

**Speaker A:** They have actually 3 retreats a month, 2 in Thai and 1 in English. Ah, got it. At Deepavaram, uh, they have generally 1 in Thai, 1 in English, and 1 in Russian.

**Speaker B:** Cool, lots of Russians. So I would like to go to the English one It would be nice to see John Poe and also Dhammavirtu again. That would be great. I don't know if they'll remember me, but it'd be good to— yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** But, um, anyway, well, you're not the same one who was there in 2013 anyway.

**Speaker B:** No, I'm not. Neither are they. But, uh, um Good stuff. So this was very useful today. I really appreciate it. As always, it's always useful, you know. But do you have any final concluding thoughts or any pointers or

**Speaker A:** tips? Yes, everything has to be back to this present moment. Renunciation is planning for a future that you cannot right now control. The next one is about power. Wanting power is the same as wanting anything that you don't have. It's suffering. Getting yourself into a state of satisfaction is not suffering. Power is something, whether it's magical power or any other kind of power Power is sought because people are insecure. When you are not insecure, when you feel secure, you don't need power, and therefore you don't want it. But somehow or another, it's self-evident[No

**Speaker B:** speech] Hello.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) in dialogue with a Sangha friend (Speaker B), centers on the practical challenge of maintaining mindfulness (*sati*) during times of stress, and how to skillfully build a resilient practice. Here is a summary of the key themes and insights:

### **Core Theme: Sati Under Stress**
*   **The Problem:** Mindfulness is most needed when we are stressed (e.g., sick, quitting an addiction, emotionally overwhelmed), but that is precisely when it is hardest to access. This is compared to **Murphy's Law**—things fail at the worst possible moment—and the metaphor of being "up to your hips in alligators," forgetting your original goal was to drain the swamp.
*   **The Solution:** One must **build *sati* as a skill in advance**, during calm periods, so it becomes a reliable resource during crises. The practice is about remembering what you are doing *right now*, not just remembering a rule you set for yourself.

### **Key Practical Teachings**
1.  **"Not Now" vs. "Not Ever":** True renunciation in the Buddhist sense is not about making a rigid, future vow (e.g., "I will never smoke again"), which creates guilt and struggle. Instead, it is the wise, moment-to-moment application of **"not right now."** This approach reduces the burden and allows you to skillfully postpone unwholesome actions minute by minute.
2.  **Gladdening the Mind as a Skill:** Drawing from the *Anapanasati Sutta*, the talk emphasizes that "gladdening the mind" is not just a step but a **skill to be developed continuously** with each breath. The primary goal is to cultivate and *sustain* a joyful, wholesome state (associated with the first *jhana*), not just to attain it briefly.
3.  **Cost-Benefit Analysis (The Second Noble Truth):** We pursue things (like smoking) because of the gratification they provide. Wisdom involves honestly inspecting both the **gratification *and* the dangers** (costs) of our habits. Companies sell benefits and hide costs; our practice is to see both clearly and decide if the price is worth it. The ultimate aim is to "find our gratifications at a discount"—in the present moment, without harmful side effects.
4.  **Dealing with Hindrances and "Falling Off a Cliff":** It's normal for practice to have peaks and valleys. When mindfulness drops (especially under stress), the key is to **guard against the specific thoughts that pull you out of a good state**. The "Aha, Mara, I see you" moment of recognizing a hindrance is itself a joyful victory. The skill is in learning to sustain the good state by catching and releasing the thoughts that lead away from it.

### **Clarifications on Technique and Tradition**
*   **The *Nimitta* (Sign):** The talk clarifies that the *nimitta* (often a visual sign) is a later commentarial concept (from the *Visuddhimagga*), not found in the early suttas. While it can be useful for advanced concentration leading to higher *jhanas*, it is **not necessary for the foundational practice** of the first *jhana*, which is the primary focus. The core practice is "grabbing hold" of the breath and gladdening the mind.
*   **Critique of Western Buddhism:** There is a tendency to seek advanced, complex teachings ("PhD dissertations") before mastering the fundamentals ("Dick and Jane"). The emphasis should be on **grasping the core skill of mindfulness and joy**, not on prematurely reaching for advanced objects.
*   **Celibacy & Power:** The discussion challenges the idea that celibacy or renunciation inherently grants spiritual or magical power. Desire for power often stems from **fear and insecurity**. True "power" from practice is the **freedom from fear** that comes from not being attached to a fixed, defendable self. The Buddha's "middle path" is about wisdom in the present, not extreme vows for the future.

### **Conclusion**
The talk ultimately circles back to the **primacy of the present moment**. Practice is about building the skill of mindfulness and gladdening the mind here and now, so that when the "alligators" of stress arise, you have the tools to remember your purpose and choose wisely, moment by moment. Renunciation is a present-moment wisdom of "not now," not a heavy rule about the future. The goal is a secure, joyful mind that doesn't need to seek external power or gratification.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, here are the primary **metaphors and stories** used in the talk:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Murphy's Law as a Metaphor for Sati (Mindfulness):**
    *   The speaker uses Murphy's Law ("Anything that can go wrong will go wrong at the last or worst possible moment") to illustrate how Sati is hardest to access precisely when we need it most—during times of stress, sickness, or withdrawal (like quitting smoking). Just as a rocket is most likely to fail at liftoff (maximum stress) or a hard drive during installation (handling stress), our mindfulness is most likely to fail when our mental "system" is under the most pressure.

2.  **The Alligator Swamp:**
    *   This is a vivid metaphor for being overwhelmed by immediate problems (the "alligators") to the point where you forget your original, larger goal ("to drain the swamp"). It directly parallels the difficulty of remembering to practice mindfulness (Sati) when you are besieged by cravings, hindrances, or daily stresses.

3.  **Cost-Benefit Analysis (Business Metaphor):**
    *   The speaker frames the Buddhist teaching on seeking gratification in terms of a business "cost-benefit analysis." We are drawn to things (like smoking) for their perceived benefits (gratification), but often fail to properly evaluate the long-term costs (health, expense, addiction). This metaphor is extended to how industries (tobacco, oil) sell the benefits while hiding the costs.

4.  **The Painted Face / Makeup Package:**
    *   Used in the discussion about desire and attraction, this metaphor suggests one can appreciate beauty (the "painted face," the effort) without needing to possess or be attached to the source ("I don't want the face"). It's a way to acknowledge gratification without being controlled by craving.

5.  **Owning vs. Renting a House:**
    *   This metaphor illustrates the burden of attachment and possession. "If you own a house, that house owns you" (with maintenance, worries). Renting represents a lighter, less attached relationship. This ties into the discussion on renunciation and freedom—possessions create responsibility and tie you down.

6.  **The Moving Target:**
    *   In discussing the "self" and fear, the speaker suggests that not having a fixed, solid sense of self ("a moving target") is a form of safety. If there's nothing static to attack, you are less vulnerable to fear and don't need to seek defensive "power."

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The NASA Rocket & Electronics Industry:**
    *   A story to ground the Murphy's Law metaphor, citing how the principle transformed engineering by focusing on failure points during maximum stress (e.g., rocket liftoff, component installation).

2.  **The Tobacco Industry's Half-Truth:**
    *   A story about how the tobacco industry used selective statistics (people smoking ~5 cigarettes a day were statistically healthier) to obscure the real danger. The speaker then reframes this: the slight benefit came not from tobacco, but from the deep, mindful breathing ("Anapanasati breath") smokers would take with those few, precious cigarettes.

3.  **AOL Buying Time Warner:**
    *   Cited as a clear business example of a bad "cost-benefit analysis." AOL "bit off more than it could chew," failing to see the immense costs, which led to its downfall. This story is used to illustrate how humans make similar miscalculations in personal life.

4.  **The Student & Robinson Crusoe:**
    *   Speaker B tells a personal anecdote about trying to read a book far above his grade level (Robinson Crusoe) just to win a pizza party. It illustrates the danger of "reaching beyond one's grasp" in practice—trying to grasp advanced teachings (like PhD dissertations) before mastering the fundamentals (Dick and Jane).

5.  **Ajahn Chah and Thoughts of Girls:**
    *   Referenced as a well-known teaching story. The point is that having thoughts (e.g., of attractive people) is natural and not the problem; the danger arises when thoughts turn into active desire and intention to act. This shifts the focus from suppression to wise evaluation.

6.  **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's Trouble with the Sangha:**
    *   A historical anecdote about how Buddhadasa was accused of "sangha decessa" (splitting the sangha) for teaching profound doctrines like emptiness (Sunyata) and non-self (Anatta) to laypeople, which was considered "the right Dhamma to the wrong people." This story highlights his focus on the core, liberating teachings over popular religious beliefs.

7.  **The Prince and the Pauper:**
    *   Referenced to illustrate that with power and possession (the Prince's palace) comes danger and the need for protection. True freedom and lack of fear often come with having little to defend (the Pauper's life).

These metaphors and stories are used throughout the conversation to make abstract Dhamma concepts—like the elusive nature of mindfulness, the evaluation of gratification, and the meaning of renunciation—more concrete, relatable, and memorable.
