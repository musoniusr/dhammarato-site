### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Philip and Jonas, and maybe some other people will pop in, but we're just relaxing.

**Speaker C:** Hi, Edward.

**Speaker B:** What's up, guys? I kind of have bad service. I'll probably join the call in like 5 minutes. Sure. Whatever, whatever happens will happen. So like I was saying, we're just relaxing, we're just friends talking. There's nobody in charge or anything. So if you have anything you want to talk about, feel free to talk. I'm just hosting, so if there's silence, there's silence. And if I do a spiel, if there's silence, I'll do a spiel. We'll see what happens. But does— do you guys have anything on your minds considering or relating to the Dharma?

**Speaker A:** Maybe we can talk about Anapanasati, because I'm actually not sure what it's actually about. I know it has something to do with breathing and with the practice. Yeah, but I feel like everyone is talking about Anapanasati always, and it was never explained to me what it actually means.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, true, true. Anapanasati. Hi, buddy. I'm here with my son, so you might hear some Disney movies or something in the background. But true Anapanasati is part of the Noble Eightfold Path, and that's actually in a way the entirety of our practice. Because our whole practice, it's not theoretical, it's not philosophical. We don't have to over-intellectualize it. The whole path, or the whole doorway rather, the whole thing that we can do right now, right here, is to remember to look and change. And what are we remembering to look? Hi, Arya.

**Speaker D:** Hello, Aurelian.

**Speaker C:** Hello. Hello.

**Speaker B:** So we're just talking about Anapanasati, and it's part of the Noble Eightfold Path. And what it is, is remembering that everything's okay, everything's fine here and now. And our breath is the doorway to right here and right now and the reminder of the actual Dhamma, the actual reality. Apart from the dissatisfaction that comes here, we bring ourselves, our awareness toward our breath. And we breathe in, everything's okay, happily, wherever we are, in a balanced way throughout our day. For beginners, and then as you build momentum with the practice, everything becomes meditation, everything's a lifestyle, everything's Sati. Sati means to remember. Anapanasati is to remember the breath. Why do we remember the breath? Because it's the last thing in this physical reality that matters. If we don't have the breath, we die. And also it brings us, like I said, our awareness to the present moment, right here, right now. The middle way, not the future, not the past, but right here, right now.

**Speaker A:** And is the breath at some point also a hindrance if we cling to it?

**Speaker B:** Whether things are a hindrance or not depends on if they're the cause of dissatisfaction. My shirt is not a hindrance, but if I wake up and I'm obsessing about my shirt and it has to be perfect, and if it's not perfect, it's causing me fear, hatred, anger, delusion, frustration, anxiety, then it's a hindrance. But now it's just a shirt, you see. Life is just life. But it's the same example as the shirt. We create these imaginary characters we call 'I', 'me', 'my' in our head. We cling to the ego. The head of the snake is a sense of 'I'. Why is it the head of the snake? Because the sense of 'I' is the fountainhead. It's the thing where everything, all the dissatisfaction you can have springs from there. Like Ajahn Chah said, if there's no mind, there's no problem. Basically saying, if there's no ego, there's no problem. Because who is it that would have the problem? The breath can't have the problem. The breath is just the breath. The breath is just is what it is. And it's, you know, oftentimes with Anapanasati in the whole Noble Eightfold Path.

**Speaker C:** We're.

**Speaker B:** Always trying to analyze it. It's just an action. The Noble Eightfold Path is an action. What people call Buddhism is an action. It's not up for debate. It's nothing to talk about too much in detail of little things here and there. What it is is just a practice of remembering that everything's fine right here. Away from this ego mind that causes all our trouble. And it's as simple as the Zen saying: when we're washing our dishes, we're washing our dishes. We're eating, we're eating. When we're sleeping, we're simply sleeping. To make anything more complex than that is to stray away from our true nature that is just this peace and emptiness. Like when you're washing dishes, you forget yourself. And there's this, there's this peace. It's the only way I could really describe it. When you're washing dishes, when you're sweeping the floor, there's this peace. And the emphasis on Anapanasati with the breath is like something I wrote the other day. It's like this little broom or sink we could bring with us wherever we go. It's an activity that we could bring with us wherever we go. If we can remember to use this important tool called Anapanasati. And then we'll experience the fruits of this tool, which is the Dhamma, which is true reality, which is just apart from an idea of an ego. It's a peace, it's an emptiness. And I like the way Ramana Maharshi said it the best. And yeah, you could pick apart that technicalities of the way he words this, but we're in the practice of silence. It's as simple as that. Just silence. Baseline zero. The mind will wander. That's okay. We don't have a problem with the mind wandering. But yeah, does that answer your question? Anapanasati is— look, I'll do it right now. Ready? Oh, everything's okay. That's the whole Noble Eightfold Path right here, right now. Everything's okay. Everything's okay. Then this builds momentum. Oh, everything's okay. That's what he says. Well, what about this? But what about that? But what about this? But what about that? And you go continue the whole imaginary character of the mind, of the ego, that causes all these problems. And for some reason, it's really difficult— can be really difficult, rather— for people to remember that you don't need to be a slave to the mind. You don't need to create an ego. Everybody you meet is going to have something that we would prefer it was another way. Oh, I like this person, but I prefer he was this way or she was this way. Oh, I like this situation. Except for this, this, and this. But we have to become the change. We have to become what we wish other people were, what we wish other situations were. We become that, and it's called the Buddha. Where somebody's cruel to us, it doesn't bother us. A situation doesn't go exactly our way, it's no problem. We have the ability to maintain this Anapanasati practice. And we reap the fruits of it. It's a joyful thing. I used to say back in the.

**Speaker A:** Day.

**Speaker B:** What we call meditation, but really Sati and Anapanasati, the Noble Eightfold Path in its entirety, it's not a punishment. It's not a puzzle to solve, and it's not a punishment. It's something we enjoy doing. That's why we do it, because it makes us happy, happier than we otherwise would have been if we weren't doing it. If we're not doing Anapanasati, we become a character. My name's Robert, my name is Dhamma, I have this past, oh, I have this trauma, and then I get caught in the spider webs, I get caught in the weeds in the water, I'm caught in the weeds and I'm drowning, you know, in my mind. But when I come back to the breath, where is the Sangha? Where is Dharma, where is up, where is down, where is good, where is bad, where is evil? It doesn't exist. And we all do this when we're sweeping the floor, like I said, doing dishes, when we get caught in these moments of just losing ourselves. That's— there it is right there. Remember to look at that. That's our true nature, and it's available anytime, anywhere. Anybody else have anything they want to say or add on to his question about Anapanasati? Feel free.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, people really— people and Westerners love to overcomplicate it, but it's so effortless to just take a breath, tell yourself you're okay, It's free, available at any point, and you're not clinging to anything, you know. You're not attaching it onto something external from yourself. It's not a cigarette, it's not a snack, it's not a tea even, you know. It's not even like working out, you know. You can not work out for a week and you're still going to be happy. Sure, it might help you feel better in your body, but yeah.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, you really— Anapanasati, it's so beautiful because I just stopped smoking and I was like, okay, I'm relaxing when I have a cigarette. That's when I feel like I can relax, I'm allowed to relax, I've been trained to relax then. But the truth is I can just breathe and I'll be relaxed. I don't need a cigarette, I don't need anything. I can just relax. There's not much to it.

**Speaker D:** I think I spoke about this in a previous call, but I said then that personally I think cigarettes are really perverted in the sense they've like taken the action of breathing, commodified it, also tacked on a bunch of chemicals onto it, and then sold to you as a package to— you're relaxed, but in reality you're just breathing and having a whole lot more, which is also bad for your body. So yeah. But that's great to hear, man. I'm really happy to hear you're no longer smoking.

**Speaker C:** Also, what I think is even worse, you're telling yourself, okay, I've just done something, doesn't matter what it is, but I can only enjoy it after I had the cigarette. Like, I had good food, now I have a cigarette, now I'm enjoying things. Instead of just enjoying the thing you're doing anyway, because that's the thing you're enjoying, you're not really enjoying the cigarette. And you can just enjoy the thing. You don't need the cigarette. It's great.

**Speaker D:** You can give yourself permission to enjoy it regardless, cigarette or not.

**Speaker A:** I feel like that's what's happening a lot when we start practicing, like noticing in all kinds of ways how conditioned.

**Speaker E:** We are or were.

**Speaker A:** In just doing things. For example, I never really smoked actively, but for me it was a long time always together with drinking. And yeah, for a long time I just accepted it the way it was. And bringing in the practice, actually, kind of I started catching it early, relatively early in the process, in kind of realizing that I want a cigarette now because I just drank a beer or something. And then kind of becoming aware of it, that I never really questioned this a lot. And I feel like this happens on all fronts, kind of at our, kind of our being, or how we are, how we used to be, and all things we also from the beginning of our childhood learned, maybe from our parents or someone else, that things have to be this way or should be that way, and never really questioned anything. And eventually it kind of became part of ourselves, and we started to kind of also make it our own. I am this way, or I am that way. I need this more, and I need that more. And just accept it as a kind of personality thing. Yeah, and that's changing a lot with the practice, at least for me, to question more what's happening and also what I'm doing and thinking.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, and what is also great, especially about just breathing, about Anapanasati, it's like, okay, we've also been told we all need something to relax or to feel good, or I need to do something, something special. Maybe I eat. I have to do a lot when I'm stressed, I eat something. But the truth is you can just breathe. You don't need anything. It's like, but we've been told, you know, when we were kids, and it's good that this happens, but we're like, okay, I've hurt myself, now mom is hugging me, now things are better. But we have to let this thought go that we need something to feel better. Again, just breathe. It's all right, it's all right. We can always feel all right. You don't need anything.

**Speaker D:** So I'm reading the chat message. I don't know if everyone can see it. If you can't, I'm happy to read it out. But one thing I would question is whether it actually gives you that energy boost you're talking about. I'm not familiar with nicotine gum, but I don't think— well, firstly, does it have caffeine in it? That might be the mechanism works off of. And secondly, um, caffeine, like, on a mechanism principle level, it doesn't give you energy, it just makes your energy reserves more available in the moment which you have the caffeine. So I would ask you whether.

**Speaker C:** Relying.

**Speaker D:** On something external is actually hurting you or helping you, because perhaps this energy is already inside you. I don't know where I'm going with this, but I'm just kind of talking about the message in general. Anyone else have any other thoughts?

**Speaker A:** I think that's an interesting direction because that's like a hard question for me. I remember I talked about it with Dhamma Dasa. In another, on some other Wednesday, and about medications, kind of what external things we should take and what not. And especially with the breath. So I've had asthma since like my childhood, since I was born. And so it's always this question for me when I have in the particular moment where I have a problem with it, just kind of be with it. And accept it and being able to deal with it or take the medicine. Yeah, you too, right? So that's— it's an interesting question. And always, yeah, I don't know what it's like. The Buddha teaches the Middle Way, and I think that's also an important thing there. It's like, can you like completely reject.

**Speaker D:** Kind of finds that energy without it, you know. That's what I think the way might be.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, yeah, sure. And also, maybe it's at some point it's good that your body tells you a lot of things, like when you're in pain to just rest, or when you're sleepy to just sleep. And sometimes possibly it's not good to suppress that.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, that's a very good reflection point at the end there.

**Speaker B:** I think— Yeah, go ahead, buddy.

**Speaker D:** Oh no, no, I was just going to ramble anyway.

**Speaker B:** So by all means, go. I was just going to say a lot of the time that people are are leaning more towards these stimulants, like Michael was saying in the chat. A lot of times, what are they doing? A lot of these people, it's either when they're very, very early beginners, or they're just people who've never heard of the Dharma practice, have never heard of the Buddha. What are they doing? They're trying to become comfortably numb to their Dukkha. To their dissatisfaction. That's what everybody does. That's what every, every, every human does. They have dissatisfaction and they'll spend a lifetime trying to cover it up with drugs, alcohol, money, material possessions, status, power. The list goes on. And if we have the wisdom to see that— we've seen people who are famous and we see them kill themselves all the time. You see them miserable all the time. If that was the way to go, they would all be enlightened masters, but they're not. They're miserable hungry ghosts, a lot of them. Not all of them, but a lot of them. They have a higher probability. So what does that tell us? You know, it's not the drugs that are the problem, it's the addiction, it's the clinging to the drugs. It's not the alcohol that's the problem, it's the addiction. It's not society that's a problem, it's the addiction to get ahead that's the problem. It's the addiction to put others down. We have to loosen our grip on all of these things. And it doesn't become a question of should I do this particular physical activity or shouldn't I? It's is that particular physical activity causing us dissatisfaction? And I can't answer that. Only the person doing said physical activity can answer that, him or herself. And if we're not aware, if we're caught up in the mess of the mind, you don't have the ability to see these bad kamas, these bad habits that we're creating. But I'm sure there's a whole bunch of monks in Thailand who smoke, and I'm sure they're happy as clams, you know. It's not a question of should they or shouldn't they. It's like, it's up to them. Like, is it causing them or others around them Dukkha? That's for them to decide, you know.

**Speaker D:** I think I have a lot of thoughts when it comes to things that negatively affect our body. So the way I see it is that whilst I know it's inevitable, I will avoid as many sources of harm to myself as possible. So like, alcohol is a poison, nicotine is an addictive substance, simply because I want to be fit and healthy for the longest possible within reason. My lived experience, you know, like I want it to be as as easy as it could be. And in my opinion, avoiding these things helps me do that. That's just my thoughts.

**Speaker C:** And also concerning the stimulants, a lot of the time we drink like coffee and stuff like this. I mean, Coffee is great, and I drink a lot of coffee just because I enjoy it. But sometimes there are those moments where you, for example, you're at work or somewhere and you feel like you need to drink the coffee because you need to perform better, you need to be more aware and stuff like this, when a lot of the time you're just fine. You don't need anything. It's fine to be tired. You, you'll get more awake eventually. And it's just fun. You don't need to fix everything and anything.

**Speaker D:** Exactly that. Yeah, um, I mean, it's all really—.

**Speaker B:** What are some good energy boosters besides.

**Speaker E:** Like caffeine and stuff? What do y'all do that's like more natural?

**Speaker B:** Or just— I breathe with activities.

**Speaker D:** I take a brain break. I breathe. I, um, return to the moment. You know, meditation is a great one, even 5 minutes. Um, I think they're almost better than external stimuli because one, they're free, two, they're always available, and four, I know my counting's off, but anyway, you get the message.

**Speaker A:** For me recently, I, I used to always like kind of get out of sleepiness or being like, um kind of stressed. I wanted to get out of it, and kind of in a way of maybe going for a run or going off, breathing fresh air. And recently I started just, when I felt like being sleepy or exhausted, I just started to just rest, even for like 10 minutes, 15 minutes, and not rest with the phone. This is like not true resting. Also resting the mind to just— I don't have to sleep, but just lying down or sitting and just being for quiet time helps a lot actually getting things going again, I think. Also, especially like recently, my sleep is a little bit bad because I dream a lot, I guess, because a lot of things are happening right now for me. And I think like kind of my mind wants to deal with them in my dreams. And yeah, it helps me a lot just to sleep maybe more like 20 minutes during the day. And this actually helps me a lot in refreshing. And yeah, it's just the way it is, and accepting that maybe kind of currently things are a little bit more of a deal for me. And yeah, kind of resetting in that way, if my body tells me I need it, and not just not trying to get away from it, to run away.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, and with getting energy I think it always heavily depends on the situation. Like sometimes you just need to sleep. When I'm at the office, I'm usually trying to take breaks, you know, go for a walk. That gives me energy back because a lot of the time you're not really tired, you're just tired from the task you've been doing. So it's good to take a break and just breathe, you know, don't look at your phone. And all the things you've said before. And a lot of the time, energy, when you need it, it will come. Like when you have a meeting with your boss or something, like you're gonna get a little nervous and you're gonna be a little more aware. Like that's a good thing. Like you don't need to be super relaxed. You're gonna get that energy kick automatically, and that's fine too, unless you're too nervous or anything. But a lot of the time when you need an energy kick, you'll just get it.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, I would say better than trying to change whatever energy levels we're imagining we have in the moment, the better thing to do would be to take a look, see, oh look, I feel tired, that's okay. And then just adjust the attitude, adjust the attitude about it. I can do this while I'm tired. It's not a problem. And I bet you, you'll take the right amount of breaks. I bet you, you'll go ahead and get whatever level of energy is necessary for the task, or you'll figure out the task doesn't fucking matter and you'll stop doing it and you'll rest because you're tired. You know, so these are messages from our body. You know, these are messages from our feelings. These are messages. Even the Dhamma, the phenomena can be looked at as messages and times, you know, the mental objects. And the attitude is a message too. It says, "Hey, fix this or you're going to have a bad time." So, if we're clinging to this idea that we need a certain amount of energy in order to do something, then we're probably not going to get it done very efficiently. And we're probably not going to be very satisfied while we're doing it. But if we can recognize the state of dissatisfaction that comes along with, "Hey, oh, my energy is low. I'm tired. I didn't sleep a lot, blah, blah, blah." All these things are good and plenty. They're great messages. If we have to ignore it, we can sit down for a second like somebody said earlier. We can follow the breath. We can get in a really good mental state, really good champion attitude, positive mindset, and we can go at it while we're tired, or we can take the hint. We can take a rest, you know? So, I like exploring it in that way, but when we think about needing to change an energy level, which what is energy dependent on? It's not dependent on a lot of things other than what? Your food, your eating, your activity level, you know? So, it's another conditioned thing. There's no need to change it. We need to change our attitude, you know, our attitude about the conditioned thing. It's okay, it's all right, everything's just fine. I'm going to get this done with no problems. Afterwards, I'll be able to rest if I want to, and while I'm doing it, I can play with it and have fun.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, attitude is everything, man. If you don't have a good attitude, good luck, you know, because that's the name of the game. Anything that comes our way that is causing dissatisfaction— what is dissatisfaction? It's wanting something that we don't have. It's want or— and/or wanting things to be different than the way they are. If we can be cool with things as they are, if we can be cool with what we have and not what we're expecting to get at some other moment in time, then what happens? Our mind therefore is cool. Nibbana, to take the food off of the fire and to cool it down, to take the mind off of the I, me, my striving, scratching, friction, anxiety-ridden fire of the mind and to cool it down. And I like reading about Bodhidharma because he always says this phrase of like coming back to our true nature in Zen. And Zen is just basically Sati, you know, it's just remembering to look and change. It's the Noble Eightfold Path. No different than anything else. Even if you're a Christian and you're following Jesus's lines of the kingdom of heaven is within you, it's all Dhamma. Call it by any name you want, but a cooled-down mind is a cooled-down mind. And reality is reality by any name. Like Shakespeare said, a rose by any name would smell as sweet. So, uh, yeah, it's just chilling out. It's as simple as that. Robert Adams, who is a student of Ramana Maharshi, has this beautiful line. He said, he said Ramana said to him, the only spiritual practice you need is to remain calm and cool in any given situation. Oh, this happened. It's all right. Oh, I feel that I'm seeking this answer. You don't need to know the answer. It's okay. But what about this? But what about that? They should call this the 'but what about this' mind. We're all fine. We're all enlightened Buddhas until Mara comes knocking on our door and says, hey, but what about this? Hey, but you ever think of this? Hey, but what about that? It's like, and that's how we're raised. Especially, I remember my mother, you know, like everything was Everything was— you could look at her, she could never just sit in peace. And she's always, 'Oh, I have to clean this, I have to do this, we have to go here.' It's like, who is telling you we have to do all this? She would probably say the bill collectors. But what's wrong, buddy?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, and I also think there is the aspect of skillfulness comes in, because sometimes it's good to think about everything. You know, you're doing a project or something and you need to think about it a lot, but you need to differentiate between having helpful moments like this and having unhelpful moments like this. And in normal everyday moments, it usually is unhelpful because you're like, you're getting yourself nervous, you're being unconcentrated because your mind goes there and there and there, and it's usually unhelpful. But it can be helpful. You just have to differentiate when it's something that's positive and when it's something that's negative.

**Speaker F:** Well, I think the big thing too is you have to do it on purpose. So you get caught up in things when you stop doing stuff on purpose, when you go back to sleep and you start letting thoughts and such start carrying you around. If we can think on purpose in this moment right now about what we need to do whenever it needs to happen, that's okay. There's no problem there. That can be very helpful. You can even let your mind free associate doing it on purpose and knowing that it's not you and it's not yours. You don't have to pick it up and carry it around. You don't have to act like it's your person or who you are, and you don't have to act like that's going to be in accord with reality whenever whatever event comes about that you were thinking on, you know. But doing things on purpose is really, really, really important. Being able to have presence.

**Speaker D:** One thing I think about a lot, because I try to like mentally prepare myself for things a lot, I like to tell myself, if I can mentally prepare myself in the now, then when I actually need to be prepared, I can just do the exact same thing then and there. And rather than stressing myself out for like hours and hours and hours thinking about something, I'll just, ah, I'll deal with it when it comes, you know. Yeah, kick the can down the road. I'm more than capable. And just return to being happy and practicing.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I like it. Something I really appreciate about the practice is the encouragement to pay attention to mundane, small, unimportant things in our life. So like, if you are drinking mindfully, then you drink mindfully. Something I like to make a joke about, but I mean, it's kind of half joking, but also I think it's really nice. It's like when you're peeing, then you're peeing mindfully. When you're pooping, we're pooping mindfully. Any kind of mundane things that you can think about. And I think it's so interesting and helpful because I feel like it's kind of fitting with what you guys are saying because I've been thinking about that. This little thing, it kind of helps in like when you're doing something, you just do. There's no— because I struggle with overthinking. I think many people here do. Those little practices just seeps into.

**Speaker A:** I.

**Speaker E:** Don'T know, just everything. Yeah, sorry, I lost my train of thought suddenly. But yeah, I just feel like saying that. And it's called.

**Speaker A:** Anapanasati.

**Speaker E:** I feel like there's formal meditation sitting and informal mindfulness that we can always do throughout our daily life. I know I find it so interesting, you know, like mundane things can be so beautiful if you immerse ourselves into it. Still trying.

**Speaker D:** It's entirely based on perspective, and we can have the ability to change our perspective in any moment. So I think that's wonderful. Make the mundane interesting. Think about how complex our bodies are in any moment. And to automatically process a task, you know, like you mentioned peeing or pooing, you know, like think about all the intricacies that goes into those actions and we take it for granted. But yeah, yeah, exactly, it's perspective.

**Speaker B:** It's the peeing and pooing sutta.

**Speaker E:** Actually, Ajahn Chah, sorry, I just want to say Ajahn Chah has a talk about that, right? Like he says, like the path to the toilet or something. I haven't watched it, but yes, right.

**Speaker B:** A lot of teachers talk about that, but it's a good point because, yeah, it's like, it's like you're surrounded by gold, you know, everything. There's like, there's a million things, like Tony Robbins said, there's a million things you can complain about in every given moment. There's also a myriad of things that you can be thankful for. And that's part of the Noble Eightfold Path is the wholesome nurturing thoughts. And we're changing the Dukkha into Sukkha. Just the other day I was walking around my house and I was looking around and I was not seeing my house like normal people see it. I was seeing it through the eyes of the Buddha. I know that these walls will be bare one day. They'll be empty. These memories will be gone. And it made me appreciate so much, like, every moment I spend here. Because where it's always too late, like Bukowski says, there's nothing worse than too late. And one day I'm going to be old and look around this house, and we're going to move into another house, and I'm going to be like, man, I wish I would have paid more attention while I was here. I wish I would have been more thankful. For everything while I was here, the good, the bad, the ugly, whatever, because it's not going to last. And man, we're rich when we can look around and say, God, I'm surrounded by gold. My little son here, I mean, sure, it can be challenging. He has special needs stuff, but God, he's a blessing. He's a pure blessing. Just like all of your guys' family or friends or houses or wherever environment you're in. It's all a blessing. You just have to recognize it. Anybody can take a diamond. We've all seen the examples of selfish people on TV, these reality shows. You could take a diamond and give it to somebody, and they could either say it's the greatest thing they've ever had, or they could be like, oh, is this all you got? Where's my car now? Where's my bigger house? Where's this? And they're hungry ghosts. They never get full. They want more and more and more. And hungry ghosts can be redeemed, but then you don't get into the realm of the demons, I like to call them. And the demons are— you can't be redeemed from that, I think. But that's, that's different subjects. It's not metaphysical, it's just my terminology for different, uh, people's mindsets. It's nothing spooky. But anyways, but yeah, you just gotta appreciate things as they are. Find value in everything that you have. Like Nisargadatta Maharaj said, if we could only learn to appreciate what we have and discard and not care if we get what we don't have, man, what else is there to do? What other practice do we need than being satisfied?

**Speaker A:** You know, I remember, I remember talking the other day to my mother, and my mother ate her— it's actually, it's kind kind of funny for me because my mother ate her first banana when she was an adult. Before that, she never had a banana. So it was like a completely different experience for her to eat her first banana. And for me, it's just like a normal thing. I'm so used to eating bananas every day whenever I want. And I'm not like— it's nothing interesting like kind of anymore. Whereas for her, it was a really interesting thing, and it still is, kind of, to like eat a banana because she has not grown up with eating it. And it can be these simple things that we have all the time around us when we realize that they are actually such a blessing to have.

**Speaker E:** Oh no, I just want to— okay, oh, go ahead. I can say that, it's fine.

**Speaker C:** Okay, um, so I think, I think there are like two, two things with being in this moment and appreciating reality as it is, because I think it's important that we cultivate awe, because life is amazing, those things are amazing, and sometimes it's enough to just look at something like you are drinking. It's like, oh, this glass, it's amazing. I've never actually looked at the glass that much. And there are so many things I don't know about it. But then also, you can also think about it. And this is sometimes helpful to build awe. Like, for example, I bought this glass in a store. So it needed to get in the store. There were many people involved for it to get in the store, for it to be stacked in the store, for it to be produced, for the chain of materials to go there, for the technology that we have that produced this glass. And it's just an endless chain because everything is conditioned, everything is endless, everything conditions each other thing. And it's an endless chain, and it's sometimes important to remember that because things are so amazing. Like, there's so many requirements and things that go into things. It's endless. It never stops, and it triggers awe in me, and it's a very, very good thing to do, I think.

**Speaker D:** One thing I really enjoyed from Dhamma Das's mention is when he said he was looking at his house as the Buddha would, and I think that's something I'm going to start thinking about now because I think it's just really— and like you also said, to cultivate awe, it helps you cultivate that awe and enjoyment and appreciation for the things you have. I think that's really important.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** I think having the Buddha as a kind of role model is very helpful anyway in the practice, because in Zen, people often say everyone has Buddha nature. You have Buddha nature, everyone has Buddha nature. But it also means you can also have, you know, the calmness of the Buddha the compassion of the Buddha. And sometimes it helps me to think, oh, how calm would the Buddha feel? What would this calmness be like? And then I feel calm because it's like such a great thing. And it's like you can just experience that, no reason not to.

**Speaker A:** I sometimes have these moments with animals. For example, I just remembered because I saw a spider that's walking somewhere on my table. And like the normal reaction is to kind of wanting to get it out. Or I don't know, just be like, put it away or something like this, get it out. Sometimes I see animals and I just think about how amazing it is that I, in this here and now, right here, I share this moment with this animal and we're looking at each other and how much I actually should appreciate this, however or whoever this animal might be and however it came here. It just is with me here right now. And this can be, you can either appreciate this and get a lot of joy out of it, or you can just think in your conditioning, I'm scared of this spider, I want to get it out, it's disgusting or something like this. So there's so many moments, I think, especially with animals and nature to have kind of this Buddha view, maybe.

**Speaker B:** That reminds me of what Ajahn Chah said. He said in this book I was reading, I think it's called Food of the Heart, I think. Wonderful book. I'm on my like 15th time of reading it. I always read his books over and over, listen to his books on audio. But he was saying, you know, the fact that you could offer him a million dollars to kill an ant and he would not do it. And I was thinking about the other day, I'm like, would I do that with all my family and all my things that could benefit from a million dollars? Would I kill an ant for a million dollars? Like, and I seriously thought about it, not just playing around. I'm like, no, I wouldn't. A billion dollars? Because that's not valuable to me. I may accidentally kill an ant, or I may even kill an ant if I thought it was suffering, I'm sure some Buddhists would disagree with me on that, but whatever. Everybody has to find their own way. But if somebody was like, here's $1 million, kill this ant, I just wouldn't do it. And that may seem silly, but it's— if you can get to that place where you truly in your heart know that you wouldn't even kill a mosquito for $1 billion, I say that's a good indication you're on the right path. Because what does that mean? That means that your Dharma practice is more valuable to you than gold, all the gold in the world. You already have all the gold in the world if that's your attitude, if that's your mindset. How wonderful! If you all won the lottery right now, about half of you'd be dancing and hollering and happy. But we all have the Dharma. We all have won the lottery. It's our birthright, the Buddha nature. If we never— if we think we don't have the Buddha nature, it's just because we have avidya, ignorance. We don't see all things as Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta, impermanence. Dissatisfaction and inherently empty. We see them as permanent. We see them as the way we want them to be. We see them as permanent self. This is wrong. And that's what's causing our suffering, is this clinging to Anicca, Dukkha, and Arhat, not seeing it for what it is. A billion dollars can do a lot of good, but what does more good is if you're satisfied without depending on the physical world, especially without depending on ignorance. If you have wisdom, you'll see that that's just a road that won't lead anywhere good. It may be pretty, you know, you could dress up a pig any way you want, but it's still a pig. Anicca dukkha anatta is anicca dukkha anatta, and it's all here. Mara lives in the mind, but the good news is she's not even real. And we see that truth when we come back to the breath and say, everything's all fine, everything's fine, nothing, no problems, nowhere to go, nothing to do. This is the only practice that we'll ever need, because this I, me, my mind that's so important important. It's just a fantasy. It goes away when we come back to the breath, just as the Buddha came back to his breath, just as you and you and you and you all come back to your breath. That's the Dharma. The fruits of coming back to the breath are the Dhamma. Coming back to the breath is the Dhamma practice. It's the yin-yang, the finger pointing to the moon. The Noble Eightfold Path is the finger and the moon is the Dharma, and it's a yin-yang, or the fruits of the practice, but it's all Dharma. But going towards negativity, going towards things that are unwholesome, it's not worth it. It takes some practice to start making some real change, but not much really. In a way, a lot, but in a way not so much.

**Speaker E:** As well. You know, but I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Can you repeat again what the title of the book was by Ajahn Chah?

**Speaker B:** Oh, it's a wonderful book. I believe it's Food of the Heart, and I don't have the physical copy. I just have it on audible.com. But when you can get the physical copy too is A Still Forest Pool, I believe. And that is another one I've read like 15 times. It is just wonderful. And they have it on Audible as well.

**Speaker A:** And you can also read the PDF. I just Googled it. It's there on the Ajahn Chah website. So you can read it for free actually. Gives you the PDF.

**Speaker B:** Wonderful. Yeah, I love when you post.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Another good free read if you guys are interested online is Bhuddhadass Bhikkhu has a free paper online, a free essay called "No Religion," and it'll knock your socks off. It's great. He goes, he goes in depth on some real good Dharma practice.

**Speaker A:** Actually, I really like the one, this book that Ivan recommended to me, I think. But what is it called, Ivan? It's also by Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, right? Something.

**Speaker E:** The Happiness and Humble, I think.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it was a great book in my opinion.

**Speaker E:** I watched the talk you had with Dhammarato, then you were asking about that. Interesting.

**Speaker B:** And speaking of Dhammarato, we— and books, we always have to keep in mind his wonderful saying: the best book we can ever read is right between our ears and in our heart. No book can top that. I just had to throw that in there, thinking of Dhammarato.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, it's so interesting. I literally, a few hours ago, I just watched some of my old video where I talked.

**Speaker C:** To Dhammarato.

**Speaker E:** And I mean, I always do that once in a while, rewatch videos. And it's like every time I look back, there's just things that I think I got it. But then when I rewatch it, I'm just like, oh, like now I got it more. Like I really understood more what he's saying. It's so simple. It go right through my head.

**Speaker B:** And the Dhamma, it does, it has that effect too. It's like when we're doing the Dharma practice, the fruits of the Dharma practice, peace and emptiness. And also a lot of people react in different ways. Speaking of energy, you get excited about the Dharma, you know. You want to do— it's like if there was something to be greedy for, it would be the Dharma practice. It would be the fruits of the Dharma. And it keeps you entertained, it keeps you energetic, it keeps you satisfied. And there's no limit to it. The sky's the limit, you know. Beyond the sky's the limit. And I like that about the Dharma practice as well.

**Speaker E:** Something happened to me just now. It's so interesting because I was just thinking about— not, not like an intellectualizing kind of way, just feeling like an emotional experience of— I don't know, it's hard to explain. Like, I'm thinking about it, but it's not like the intellectual refracting way that I was sleeping. And it's almost like I was aware that I was sleeping. And then when I wake up, and then like there's this unexplainable weird understanding of something I'm thinking about. Like, it's this feeling— I don't know how to explain it, it's so funny— like it's not intellectual. And I begin to understand more about why people say Dharma is not something to be intellectualized. Like, because it blocks, it almost like blocks the path to what really the Dharma is about. So I don't know, just want to say that, like, it's so interesting because I just woke up in a very wholesome state. Like, it's very rare.

**Speaker C:** Isn't that nice?

**Speaker F:** Yeah, when you say you're thinking about something, perhaps you mean something like it's not discursive thought?

**Speaker E:** No, it's not discursive.

**Speaker F:** So it's still thought, it's just not discursive thought. It's just a wholesome thought. You woke up in a wholesome state.

**Speaker B:** Of mind with a wholesome thought.

**Speaker F:** Isn't that beautiful?

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker F:** Isn't it wonderful how it happens more and more with the practice?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.

**Speaker B:** It's great because as they talk about that, we talk about Metta being a.

**Speaker F:** Product of correct practice. And if you read the sutta about Metta, he talks— this is one of the benefits of Metta, you sleep well. You cultivate this in your practice, it's a product of correct practice, it comes about as a result of correct practice. That's really cool.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Yeah.

**Speaker F:** Isn't that nice that you can verify the teachings directly like that?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, yeah, it does feel nice. It's so sublime, but at the same time it's like, wow, right?

**Speaker B:** Absolutely, this stuff works. This is good stuff.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, right here, right now.

**Speaker F:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Well, on that note, guys, I'll probably end it, but I'll give you guys an opportunity if anybody has anything else on your mind or you want to say or whatever. Now's the time before we leave. Anybody have anything?

**Speaker F:** Thank you everyone for coming on. I had a great time.

**Speaker D:** Thank you, Anagami.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, everyone. Thank you so much, guys. Love all you guys.

**Speaker A:** Love you guys, bye.

**Speaker B:** Much peace and love. Much love, guys.

**Speaker E:** Care.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, the central theme is a practical, non-intellectual understanding of **Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing)** as the core of the Noble Eightfold Path. Here is a summary of the key points discussed:

### **Core Teaching: Anapanasati as the Essential Practice**
*   **What it is:** Anapanasati is not just a meditation technique, but the foundational practice of remembering to return to the breath. It is the "doorway" to the present moment and the entire Dhamma.
*   **Its Purpose:** The breath is always available and serves as an anchor to bring awareness to the "here and now," away from the dissatisfied, ego-driven mind ("the head of the snake"). The simple act of noticing the breath and remembering "everything's okay" is the essence of the practice.
*   **The Result:** This practice leads to a natural state of peace, silence, and "emptiness" — your "true nature." It is compared to the effortless focus found in mundane activities like washing dishes or sweeping the floor, where you "lose yourself" in the action.

### **Key Insights from the Discussion**
1.  **Simplicity Over Complexity:** The speakers repeatedly emphasize that the path is simple, actionable, and **not theoretical**. It's about "remembering to look and change" your attitude in the present moment, not debating philosophy.
2.  **The Root of Suffering:** Dissatisfaction (*Dukkha*) springs from the ego-mind (the sense of "I," "me," "mine") and its constant wanting things to be different. Anapanasati helps disentangle from this.
3.  **A Lifestyle, Not a Chore:** The practice is not a punishment or puzzle. It is enjoyable and becomes a seamless part of life ("everything becomes meditation"). It is something you do because it makes you happier.
4.  **Deconditioning Habits:** The group discusses how practice helps reveal and undo conditioned behaviors (like smoking after a drink or needing coffee for energy). They highlight that we often seek external things to relax or feel good when the capacity for peace is always internally available through the breath.
5.  **Skillful Attitude is Key:** A major focus is on cultivating the **right attitude**. Instead of trying to change external conditions (like low energy), change your attitude *toward* them. See feelings like tiredness as messages, not problems. A "cooled-down mind" that accepts things as they are is the goal.
6.  **Finding Awe in the Mundane:** The practice encourages mindful awareness in everyday activities (eating, drinking, even using the toilet). This cultivates appreciation and awe for the incredible, conditioned nature of ordinary life, seeing it "through the eyes of the Buddha" — with the wisdom of impermanence.
7.  **The Role of the Buddha as an Inspiration:** Considering "What would the Buddha's calm be like?" or "How would the Buddha see this?" can be a helpful tool to access one's own innate "Buddha nature" — the potential for peace and compassion already within.

### **Conclusion**
The talk frames Anapanasati as a simple, portable tool for spiritual awakening. By continually returning to the breath and the attitude that "everything's okay," one dis-identifies with the anxious ego, sees through conditioned habits, and finds peace and richness in the present moment. The ultimate goal is to make this mindful, grateful, and cool-minded awareness the default way of experiencing life.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several **metaphors and stories** to explain the Dharma practice, particularly Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing) and the nature of the mind. Here is a breakdown:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **The Breath as a Doorway/Tool:**
    *   The breath is described as **"the doorway to right here and right now"** and a **"reminder of the actual Dhamma."**
    *   It is also compared to a **"little broom or sink we could bring with us wherever we go"**—a portable tool for cleansing the mind and returning to the present.

2.  **The Ego/Mind as a Source of Trouble:**
    *   **"The head of the snake is a sense of 'I'."** This metaphor illustrates that the sense of self is the dangerous source (the head) from which all dissatisfaction springs.
    *   The ego creates **"imaginary characters"** we call 'I', 'me', 'my'.
    *   The untamed mind is likened to being caught in **"spider webs"** or **"weeds in the water"** where we are drowning in our thoughts.

3.  **Meditative Peace in Everyday Activity:**
    *   The state of mindfulness is compared to the peace found in simple tasks: **"when you're washing dishes, you forget yourself. And there's this peace... When you're sweeping the floor, there's this peace."** This is presented as a glimpse of our "true nature."

4.  **The Mind's "But what about..." Voice:**
    *   The distracting, worrying mind is personified as a voice that constantly says, **"Hey, but what about this? ... Hey, but what about that?"** Speaker B calls this the **"'but what about this' mind,"** and links it to **Mara** (the Buddhist personification of temptation and death) knocking on the door.

5.  **Addiction and Clinging as "Hungry Ghosts":**
    *   People who are never satisfied, always seeking more from external things (drugs, status, money), are described as **"miserable hungry ghosts."** This references a Buddhist concept of a suffering realm where beings have insatiable appetites.

6.  **Cooling the Mind:**
    *   The goal of practice is described as cooling down the agitated mind: **"to take the mind off of the I, me, my striving, scratching, friction, anxiety-ridden fire of the mind and to cool it down."** This directly relates to the concept of *Nibbana* (extinguishing).

7.  **The Dharma as Priceless Wealth:**
    *   The value of Dharma practice is contrasted with material wealth. Speaker B says that if your practice is so firm you wouldn't kill an ant for a billion dollars, it means **"your Dharma practice is more valuable to you than gold... You already have all the gold in the world if that's your attitude."** He concludes, **"We all have won the lottery. It's our birthright, the Buddha nature."**

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **The Story of Not Killing an Ant:** Speaker B recounts a point from Ajahn Chah's teachings, reflecting on whether he would kill an ant for a million dollars. He uses this personal reflection to illustrate the supreme value of non-harm and a mind grounded in Dharma over all worldly wealth.

2.  **The Mother's First Banana:** Speaker A shares an anecdote about his mother eating her first banana as an adult. This story serves as a metaphor for how we lose **"awe"** and take simple blessings for granted, while they can be sources of wonder if seen with fresh eyes.

3.  **Reference to a Personal Habit (Cigarettes):** Speaker C shares a personal story about quitting smoking, realizing that the relaxation he sought from a cigarette was actually available simply through mindful breathing. This is a practical story of discovering an internal refuge instead of an external crutch.

4.  **References to Teachers' Sayings:** The talk is peppered with references to stories and phrases from revered teachers, which serve as authoritative anecdotes:
    *   **Ajahn Chah:** "If there's no mind, there's no problem."
    *   **Ramana Maharshi / Robert Adams:** "The only spiritual practice you need is to remain calm and cool in any given situation."
    *   **Zen Sayings:** "When we're washing our dishes, we're washing our dishes."
    *   **Nisargadatta Maharaj:** The idea of appreciating what we have and not caring for what we don't have.

**In summary,** the metaphors consistently frame the breath as a simple, accessible tool, the ego as a dangerous illusion, and peace as our natural state. The stories and anecdotes provide personal and relatable evidence for the teachings, emphasizing the value of practice, the joy of simple presence, and the importance of seeing the world with wisdom and awe.
