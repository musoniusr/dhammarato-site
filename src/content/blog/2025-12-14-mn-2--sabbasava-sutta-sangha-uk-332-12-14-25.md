### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Well, welcome, friends. Today is Sunday afternoon, the 14th of December, and today we're going to be talking about the Sabbha Asava Sutta, which is in the Majjhimanakaya number 2. Now, Sabbha Asava means all the taints or all of the asavas And that this is actually a very, very valuable sutta because it has a whole bunch of stuff in it. It actually covers everything about what the Buddha teaches. It's not got a lot of detail, but it does have a structure that is really worth noting. The word asava, by the way, has the definition of— we can use old words like canker or outflow or pus. You can think of it as a boil or as even blackheads, but it's impurities that can be seen. And so that's used in conjunction in other suttas with the word kilesa, which has to do with bondage, or fetters is the word that's often used. Ball and chain would be a good example. So today we're going to be talking about the Sabbā-Asavasutta. And that it starts off— actually, it's a list of 7 things, and that the first one is the defilements that can be eradicated by seeing, or another word would be knowledge. Now, this section starts off with talking about what Hinduism and a lot of other religions do in the sense of focusing on the self. It talks about who am I, what was I, what will I become, how do I move from here to there, and other things like that. It also talks about it in the sense of does the self see the self, or does self see no self? Or does no-self see self? And a lot of other very Hindu-like stupid questions. And in this sutta, the Buddha refers to all of this as inappropriate attention. It's inappropriate to focus on who am I. In fact, you'll see a lot of Hinduism is focused around this, and that many meditation systems will focus on the question of, "Who am I?" But the Buddha says, "Oh no, this is really inappropriate attention." And he refers to it as inappropriate attention because it's unwise attention in the sense that this inappropriate and unwise attention brings up more fetters, it brings up more views, It brings us into a thicket of views, and is unwise because it increases and brings up more unwholesomeness, to where you can pay attention, wise attention to things, and wise attention then is appropriate because it reduces and eliminates unwholesomeness. By verse 11 in the— and I use number 11 because the Majjhima Nikaya translation by Bhikkhunamoli that was edited by Bhikkhu Bodhi, I think Bhikkhu Bodhi put the verse numbers in there— verse number 11 is the real essence of this sutta, and that is paying wise attention to The Four Noble Truths, but it's stated in a particular way: paying wise attention to this is suffering. And then it says this is the cause of suffering. And then it talks about this is the end of suffering. And then it points out that there is a path to the end of suffering. In that same paragraph, it also states that when one can see these Four Noble Truths and really see them, then it brings about three things. One is an understanding of personality view. The second one brings about freedom from our attachments to rights, rules, rituals, laws, shoulds, and other things like this. And it also brings about the third one, is knowledge and vision of what actually is the path and what is not the path. And when we say the path, we're actually talking about at any particular point in time, right now, whenever that is, the right thing to do is to pay attention to this path, to pay attention to the Four Noble Truths. And this is what then frees us from this asava of ignorance, is by knowledge of what is happening right now in relationship to: is there Dukkha right now or not? This is so profound that I would say that that part of the sutta alone would be enough to put it in the top 3 or 4 of all the best suttas because it really does define the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path with the benefit. Now in other suttas and in many places, they understand that knowledge and vision of personality view and eradication of the the fetter of attachment to rights, rules, and rituals that is referred to as Sila, Bhavana, Paramasa, and the knowledge of what is and is not the path. Those three things are, let us say, the groundwork that's being laid for one to become a Srotapanna. So we can also see that in this first asava we're covering the first 3 fetters. So, there is a direct relationship between fetters and asava. So, you can say then, that this knowledge is a huge boil, and that when we lance that boil, we lance it with the knowledge of the Eightfold Noble Path. And when we have that knowledge of the Eightfold Noble Path, it eradicates our personality view. Now, what do I mean by personality view? It is really that there is no permanent self. That's why the first part of that sutta talks about "Who am I?" as wrong view, because that "Who am I?" actually is trying to answer the question that determines personality. But the reality is, is that personality is not the issue. The issue is Dukkha and its eradication. So we eradicate that Dukkha by understanding that mostly what our personality is, when we think of personality, is referred to or is created by our Understanding of how things ought to be and our relationship to that, which would be our how things should be, rights, rules, rituals, orders, shoulda, woulda, couldas, and all of that, and how we relate to that in the sense of accepting it and kneeling under those rules, or rebelling against them. But when we can see that the rules are not there to be obeyed, they're to be eradicated by clear seeing, that when we see correctly, we can see the way things really are, and then we need no rules about how things ought to be. So this eradicates those first three fetters, is this knowledge. And this is an important milestone, takes one right onto the path of Sotapanna. But seeing the Four Noble Truths is not just a matter of a one-time shot or think that we've got it, that there's later parts of the sutta that we'll talk about that shows what that really means. Now, the second point of the Saba Asava, the seventh, the second item in this list of seven after seeing or knowledge comes restraint, restraint of the senses. That would be to guard the eye door. Now the monks, when they are going on bindabhat, this is a major part of the going on alms round, is to keep your eyes focused on the ground, most specifically focused on the ground around the feet of the guy in front of you, or if you're walking alone, to watch where you're stepping, to watch where you're going, to stay focused on what is real right in front of you, as opposed to what we could refer to as lollygagging or reading signs are looking at the people on the path, on the trail, or on the road, or looking at houses or anything like that. Now we can equate that then with guarding not just the eyes but all of the sense doors, but especially with the eye and the ear. That means that we should, by following the sutta, restrain the eyes and the ears into wholesome places, and that most folks go into unwholesome places right there on their cell phone. That there's a lot of unwholesomeness there. And what I mean by unwholesome is, is that by paying attention to unwholesome things, we wind up having unwholesome thoughts and therefore unwholesome feelings. And so the right way of the second one of restraint is to restrain the senses so that it's only going to be looking at wholesome things, listening to wholesome things, or neutral things, things that are not unwholesome. So the third item on the list is asava, that's to be eliminated by using, and that this is the part where the four requisites are expressed. This is an important part. This covers adequate housing, adequate clothing, adequate shelter, adequate food, and adequate medicine, those four: adequate housing or shelter, adequate clothing, because we need to have the adequate clothing to prevent gadflies and mosquitoes and other things like that. Or we need housing to protect us from wild animals and things like this. And we have to also have adequate food for the nourishment of the body, not for the pleasure. So you can see that these two work together. Instead of looking for taste things and looking for the pleasure of the taste, we recognize actually that eating food means to not look for what it tastes like, but only for the nourishment of the body, to keep the body alive and functioning correctly. The same thing would be with medications. A lot of people use the word drug and medication simultaneously, but they also use the word drug for all kinds of harmful things. And so if we keep it in the sense of medication, that means that we're going to restrain or avoid using all kinds of drugs. Alcohol, etc., like that, that actually do us harm. And we're only working with medications that are appropriate. So that's the third one. The fourth one then is one that we really want to talk about a lot today because we haven't talked about it so much, and that is things that we, uh, the, the asava, uh, that we will, uh, deal with by enduring. Now, uh, enduring actually, um, has a problem with it, uh, because there's various ways to endure things. One is to endure it in the sense of, oh God, I gotta put up with this. Oh, and Aunt Susie is really yapping and I just have to put up with it. Or we can think of endurance in the form of I can handle this. So putting up with is one form of endurance, and I can handle this as another form of endurance. But that one's not used so much that most people endure things with, oh, I've got to put up with this. Now, the list of things that the Buddha has in this sutta is things— putting up with or enduring cold, putting up with heat, putting up with basically things that we can't do anything about. Sometimes we can do something about insects and mosquitoes, and sometimes we can't. In fact, I was just a moment ago— I don't know if anybody can see it. There he is again. We've got a friend who's coming. And I'm happily putting up with the fact that he is right here. So if we can see this, then we recognize that in number one spot is that this is something that we cannot control. Can we handle it happily, or do we have to just put up with it? It's almost like the difference between using the word toleration, like the Hindus will tolerate the Christians and the Christians will tolerate the Hindus, because their only option is to kill each other. As opposed to, instead of tolerating, we'll just simply make friends with each other. So, we can in fact make friends with the cold; not just endure it, but endure it with joy, knowing that we're enduring it. Mikey, I have a photo that I'd like for you to show the group so that we can look at this just a little bit. This may give you the idea. Notice that there are 4 monks. Now, this is at the Lao Wat in Rhode Island in February, and that though it can't be seen with the photo the way that it is, if you get a very close-up detailed look, you'll see that the red car that is over the left arm of the kid, or the monk in white. There's a red car that you can see, just a little of it, the bonnet, and that there is actually frost on that bonnet. Over above that, there's actually a pile of snow off into the distance. But you don't have to look for snow to see that this is a cold weather show. This photo was taken when it was cold. You can see it's cold because of the way that the Sri Lankan monks— now the Sri Lankan monks are the two on the outside. Notice the one in the dark red is really bundled up. He's cold. And he's enduring it in the sense of not, I can handle this, but in the sense of putting up with, barely able to tolerate the cold. He's out there only long enough to get this photo taken, and then he wants to go back in the house. To where the other Sri Lankan monk in the white coat is a little bit more adaptive. But look at both of them dressed in shoes and boots, heavy coats and hats. And they're cold. Look at the other two monks in the middle. One of them is in the darker colored robe, is actually resident at this wat here, and he has a regular robe on except that he's also wearing socks and a hat. And then you'll see the fat monk there. Notice no hat, no socks, just a standard robe. And he's out there with a great big smile on his face. Now, what do you think? Who is actually able to endure that cold weather the best? Who is actually not just enduring it, but he is actually pleased that he can handle this cold? Alex, you have a comment here with this.

**Speaker B:** This is a good one. I like the gentleman in the robe. He's out there enjoying it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, he's out there getting a load out of it. Okay, this is 2006. So this was done nearly 20 years ago. Ivan, do you have a comment that you want to make about this photo?

**Speaker B:** Um, yeah.

**Speaker C:** Uh, enjoy happily. Not much to say.

**Speaker A:** All right, Timo, what do you think? Are you bundled up sufficiently so that you can enjoy your cold?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I like it.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so this gives you an idea of what the Buddha is actually meaning, even though the word is endurance. What we have to do is look at it in the sense of, can you handle cold happily? Can you handle hot happily? Can you handle gadflies and ants and critters happily? There is a story that I have about— I was standing at a crossroads inside Wat Suwan Mok with Ajahn Po, and while we were talking of Dharma, a very large hornet, orange and black, one of the big dudes, maybe an inch big, landed on the top of his head. And he knew it was there, but he was much more interested in how I would deal with that hornet than him himself. His head for a bit, and then it crawled down over his left eye the eyelash right about here. And that's when my right hand instinctively started to raise into the air, and he was ready for me because he caught my hand and says, no, don't do anything. So he was teaching me— I was a young monk at the time— that we can in fact endure those kinds of events. And the really worst part of it was, is that guy flew away all on his own. That Arahant didn't have to do anything. He didn't have to endure that guy. He was actually quite happy and pleased with the fact that he could handle having that large poisonous hornet land on his head. And I've seen them since. And in fact, Mikey You said that you've actually seen one of those dudes here near the house.

**Speaker D:** Yes, plenty of times. There have been some pretty, pretty big bugs of all sorts.

**Speaker A:** They're big, and they are angry, and they are vicious. So you don't want to deal with them. You want to let them have their way. So this is the idea of Endurance, because we can deal with things that we can't do anything about. And then the next one, number 5, is called avoidance, that there are things that we can do something about, that we can deal with them by taking a hike. In the sutta, they are listed as a wild elephant, a wild horse, a wild dog, any kind of snake. But it's also got some strange things in there, like a stump. Why would a monk avoid a stump? The answer is, who lives in that stump? Ants. So you don't want to go sit on the stump. Also Things to avoid would be like cesspools, sewers, cliffs, or dangerous ground where you can't get a good footing. And these are the things that are listed in that sutta. And by the way, it would be good if some of you would bring that sutta out so that you can go along with it on me, because I'm going to add a few things right here that are not actually in the sutta. Things to be avoided, and that would be musical concerts, sports events, prize fights, wrestling, rallies, large venues where there's a lot of people. You can also go so far as to say to avoid rush hour traffic. To avoid getting on subways or getting out into traffic during rush hour. So these are things to be avoided. But they didn't have subways in the time of the Buddha, so he didn't put that in the sutta. But he does recommend for the monks to stay away from entertainment events, that those things are intentionally designed to get people excited and to put them often in states where they can be exploited easily. And so it's best to stay away from events like that. So that's number 5. Number 6 now is getting really back into it. In the sense of things that are to be removed. Now, what is it that are to be removed? How about unwholesome thoughts, thoughts of danger, thoughts of greed, thoughts of ill will, thoughts of harming other people? In other words, unwholesome thoughts are to be removed. Now, I would like to start on a kind of a side topic, and that is that There are many places where the Buddha-Dharma is taught, but it's taught incorrectly because they talk about enduring or putting up with things that can actually be changed. The Mahasi Method with their noting says just to note, but you don't change those unwholesome thoughts, you just endure them. The same thing with other monks. No need to talk about and give out names, but Brother Yanis knows exactly who I'm talking about, in the sense of they say that feelings must be endured rather than removed. Now, let me talk about feelings for just a moment so that we can understand. In the Pali, the word Vedana is translated into the word feeling, but the actual definition of the word feeling that we use in English in modern English times is the feeling associated with emotion. Now, the kind of Vedana or the feeling that I'm talking about is not emotion but rather it is an inclination or a leaning of the mind. It's actually in a way an extension of attitude. So it's completely mental. And what we mean by Vedana is that we incline or we lean to pleasant, or I like it. We lean into unpleasant, or I don't like it. And we lean into a wobble to where we don't know whether it's neutral or whether it's pleasant or unpleasant, and that often causes confusion. However, in the Buddhist teaching of Paticcasamuppada, that this Vedana, this inclination, when it is ignorant, leads to Tanha, which is an actual word that means thirst or wanting, and that leads into clinging. Now clinging, that's where we have emotion. The clinging would be in the sense of, if I don't like it, nothing to it. But if I don't like it, then that means that we have the emotion of clinging to it, and we can call that anger, hostility, frustration, anxiety, fear, all of those kinds of things. And when monks and other meditation teachers say that those things are to be endured, I would suggest that you do not endure any more of that talk that they're giving, that you can stand up, you got that wrong, bye-bye. I'm not going to endure this. I'm going to avoid monks who are talking about enduring of feelings, any kind of, whether it is a Vedana, because you can change that, it's on the inside, or whether it's a full-blown emotion. You can also deal with that. This is what we mean by step 6 of removing You remove anger. You don't let it sit there. As soon as you see that you've gotten angry, do something about it. Come out of your anger. When you see that you've got a state of anxiety, don't put up with it. Don't endure it. Don't handle it well. Destroy it. Remove it. Get rid of it completely. This is the way that the Buddha taught: we do not endure those things that can be changed. Maybe you have heard about this, but in the organization Alcoholics Anonymous, or AA, there is something that they call the AA prayer. Now, in this prayer, it actually is quite noble in the sense that it talks about to know those things that you can change and have the bravery to change them. I wouldn't use bravery at all, I would use determination and persistence to change the things that we can change. Then it talks about the serenity to accept the things that we can't change, like cold weather, for instance. You can't change the cold weather, you can't change the hot weather, you can't change the weather at all. Though look how many times people have tried to change the weather rather than enjoying it just the way that it is. So the third part of that little poem is to have the wisdom to know the difference between what I can change and what I can't change. So that the things that I cannot change, I can happily accept, I can tolerate it easily, I can handle that, or to actually change the things like the unwholesome thoughts, etc. So when you find meditation teachers or others who are actually missing out on that point, who cannot tell the difference between what you can change and what you can't change, You can recognize that as ignorance on the part of these meditation teachers. And guess what? Almost all of them are ignorant about this. They talk about, we teach Vipassana meditation. That means that they can't tell the difference between the feelings that can change and the environment that they can't. So this is a major point of the teaching of the Buddha. About knowing the difference between the things that you can change and the things that you can't change. And basically what you can say then about it is, is that everything that is on the inside, everything that's on the inside, you did it. And you just did it. And you just now, you just did it. And you just did it. You can just undo it. And things on the outside you don't have so much control over. So let's cover the last point. And the last point is the point of— actually, it's referred to as development, and that the items on this list just happen to be the Sambhojana, the Seven Factors of Awakening. Are to be developed. And you've heard me many times talking about Sati, or to remember to be here now. That's always number one. That's the number one skill to be developed, is remember to be here now so that you can see the difference between what you can change and what you can't change. The second one is actually then the heart of the teaching of the Buddha, and that is to look to see. So this is something that we started talking about. When we see Dukkha, this is the point that needs to be developed, is to develop your ability to see what is and what is not, to be able to see what you can change and what you can't change, to see, uh, when it's time to walk away and when it's time to run. You remember that song, don't you?

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** Okay, when to hold them and when to fold them. This is the teaching of the Buddha. You have to know this. This is the wisdom part of it, is by looking. You got to look at that hand you're playing and figure out whether, uh, by the expression of the faces on the other players, whether it's time to hold them hold them, walk away, or run. And that's what you'll find in this sutta. The walking away is the avoidance. The running away is the change, the removal, the number 6 that we just talked about, to run those unwholesome thoughts right out. When to hold them is the endurance.— and when to fold them is knowing how to restrain yourself, to not play a bad hand. This is the teaching of the Saba Asava Sutra. By the way, another point that we can go on with is that we've only talked about two of them, and that's Sati and investigation. The third one on the list is actually energy, but energy here is actually the skill that is developed through right noble effort. But in the beginning, it takes a bit of effort to know when to hold them and to be able to hold them, know when to fold them, know when to walk away, and know when to run requires development of the skill of even though you know that you should be folding them, you hold them anyway. This is the right effort, is to do what needs to be done rather than what you want to do. And so the next one is also very important, and that is referred to as number 4 in these 7 factors of enlightenment. Is normally referred to as Piti-Sukkha, which we also refer to in the Anapanasati Sutta as breaking it down between Piti and Sukkha. Here they're combined together as just one point of being able to have joy, to have joy, to have freedom, to instead of just enduring it, endure it happily. You've got that, you can do it, you have the ability, you can take the effort to build up that joy until it becomes energetic, and then you can't stop the joy. It's just built right in now. Okay, so the fifth item on the list is actually rest. Uh, bad translation would be tranquility. I don't use that word, I use peacefulness. Rest, everything is easygoing, no problems, no worries, mate. That together brings on the sixth item, which is then Samadhi, the collected mind, where the mind is collected together. This is a skill to be developed. And then the last one on the list is Equanimity. Equanimity, bad translation. In fact, I don't even think the word equanimity existed until Goenka made it.

**Speaker C:** Up.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but the Pali is equanimity, and I would define it as dynamic balance, so that whatever happens in the moment, you are balanced. You can handle it very well. Everything is okay, not a problem in the world, even though the floor is going back and forth like this. You can handle that too. Everything is all right. So this is the Sabba Asava Sutta. Where the last item on the list is pure development, and that development requires practice over and over and over again. So now let's start picking on some people. Ivan, what do you have to say about the Sabbha Ashabha.

**Speaker B:** Sutta?

**Speaker A:** Perfect. Such a joy. Yeah, not much to say. Yeah, I can't handle this. Yeah. Yeah, I can handle this, right? Cold? Yeah, you can handle that. What, Malays? Yeah, you can handle them. Thai people? Sure, we can handle Thai people. Ants? Yeah, we can tolerate them by not sitting on their house. So, um, uh, Alex, what do you have to say?

**Speaker B:** It's a good sutta. I like that it ends up at development. Walks us all the way through getting rid of all those nasty things, right to the point of doing the practice.

**Speaker A:** Right here and right now. Exactly. Now, one point that you just kind of pointed at, and that is, is that this is not chronological. I know Westerners, they like everything in order, chronological order. You got to do the first grade before you do your PhD. But here We're doing the whole show all the time. There is no chronological order to this. Rather, the way that it's stated is one by one as they occur. When it comes up, you got.

**Speaker B:** It.

**Speaker A:** I like it. Okay, so Yanis, what do you have to.

**Speaker E:** Say? Yeah, I really like the sutta and what you said about catching it early. Because yeah, like if there is something you see, oh, I don't like it, and you don't let it grow, it's easier to deal with, like when you catch it early. And then later it turns into emotion. I guess like the only enduring part of the emotion is like the effect it has on your body. It's like, okay, I didn't like it and I kind of heated myself up. Now I see it. I just like don't add fuel to the fire and I can do the rest and it will cool.

**Speaker A:** Off. Timo, are you enduring this one very well.

**Speaker C:** Now?

**Speaker E:** Yes, I'd say.

**Speaker A:** So. You have anything else to.

**Speaker C:** Say? Do I understand you correctly? With the wisdom to see the difference, it's an— it's an— you say impromptu thing? Because— or would you say— No, it's an investigative thing.

**Speaker F:** Right.

**Speaker C:** So, for example, with the picture of the 4 monks in the cold. Every one of them could be practicing correctly, right? It's not about that one choose to choose the wrong thing about the endurance or not endurance. It's— they're all enjoying it, they're all enjoying it, right?

**Speaker A:** You're right, and one's doing it wrong. Just say that we're all out there together, we're a team.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, okay, that's what I.

**Speaker A:** Thought. So, Karwan, what do you have to.

**Speaker B:** Say?

**Speaker A:** So, Karwan, what do you have to say? Are you there, Karuna? So, Amrit, what do you have to.

**Speaker F:** Say? It's definitely a very, very wonderful sutta, Dhammarato. Thanks a lot for the elaboration. I have like one comment, or maybe, you know, one of my understanding. So this is regarding teaching of Ajahn Sumedho, and he talks a lot about welcoming suffering, like welcoming anger or welcoming whatever unpleasant feeling. And my understanding of how it fits with the sutta is like, when you are welcoming something, you are already changing your attitude.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker F:** Now you are instead of hating it, you are now in a better position to change it if it could be changed. Right? So I think this teaching actually kind of goes very well with what you taught about avoidance and endurance and changing.

**Speaker A:** Here's a way of looking at it is that we set up traps for certain animals. We want to trap an animal. There's a bird trap and there's a bear trap and snake traps and all kinds of things that they have set up. So you can think of it as a trap, and you want that anger to come into that trap so you can say, 'I got you.' But the ordinary mind, when anger comes, 'Oh, poor me, I've got anger. I want to get rid of it. I don't like it.' And they're not able to either tolerate it well or dispense with it immediately. They're rather— they're stuck with it. I've heard quite a lot from Achan Samatha. In fact, I was listening to talks that he gave before I ever met him when I was still a layman. Then I met him in 1985 at Wat Soen Mokkh. He invited me to Amravati, and I spent about 6 weeks there. I have great respect Achan Samatha, but I don't teach the way that he does because the way that he teaches is easy enough for students to misunderstand. An example is, is that— and Mikey and I have talked about it— that there is a video out on YouTube where Achan Samatha is talking about right noble effort is no effort at all. Well, he's not talking to beginners. He's talking to, you know, he's talking about, um, uh, adepts. He's talking about, uh, near masters. Why? Because they have already developed the skill of right noble effort so that there's no longer any effort at all. There's, aha, I got you! As opposed to, oh no, Oh no, I've got to deal with this again. And then taking the effort to change it. So the right noble effort, the way that I define it, is the least amount of effort to actually get the job done. And often no effort at all is not going to get the job done. Not for the beginner, but for Achan Samatha, Achan Amaro, Achan Prasanto, senior monks in the Arahant tradition, no effort at all is quite enough because they've got that energy. It's the energy. It's an example that I used to use is imagine that you've got a jack-in-the-box. It's an old one you found up in the closet or someplace, and you turn the thing around and it said, 'Anapanasati, Anicca, Arhat, the weasel.' And then it comes and it says, 'Pop goes the weasel,' and then the lid comes up but the jack doesn't come out. You've got to go in there and put your hand in and grab that jack by the head and pull him out. But if you keep playing with that jack-in-the-box, pretty soon the springs will come back to life, the rust will erode, and then the jack will pop up all by himself. So that's the kind of thing that Ajahn Sumedho is talking about, is a fully functioning jack-in-the-box. And guess what? Most of you don't have a fully functioning jack-in-the-box. You got to go into there and grab that jack and pull him out. And so you still need to take right noble effort to do that, okay? Yes. But I'm not saying that Aishan Samatha is wrong, because he's not wrong. He's just got a different audience that he's talking.

**Speaker F:** To. Yes, I was also— he talks a lot about this welcoming practice, and I was also quite confused for a long time about this. But I think now I am understanding what he meant there. So welcoming is just changing of the attitude, and afterwards you are in a much better position to kind of either endure it or change it if you can, whatever hindrances are there. So this was, uh, this is something after listening to you for a while, I think I, I put, uh, his teaching in a, in a better perspective. And I find actually it's also quite, uh, quite powerful, this, uh, this.

**Speaker A:** Change. He'll take any high-grade advanced Srotapanna and kick them in the butt just like Maha Maghalawat and put them right into Arahant. But an ordinary person, he's going to kick to death and they're not going to.

**Speaker C:** Move.

**Speaker A:** So there's different strokes for different.

**Speaker F:** Folks in that group.

**Speaker A:** Yes. All right, so let me see who I can pick on yet. How about you, Jonah? Do you have something to say? Back to Karwan. Karwan, are you on yet? How about you, Kershney? You got something to say? Kirsanu is not here.

**Speaker G:** Karuna. I was trying to unmute myself.

**Speaker F:** All.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker G:** So, yeah, I can endure this and I can change this, but I've been thinking, what's the best way to teach people that they can change their.

**Speaker A:** Emotions? Don't even try. They don't want to hear what you have to say anyway. All you can do is endure their stupidity and smile happily. When they begin to ask you questions, you can give them happy answers that mean something, but don't try to teach people who don't want to know the Dharma. There's a famous saying about that, and that is that don't try to teach a pig to sing. It frustrates the pig and it annoys the teacher. So don't try to teach a pig to sing. Don't try to teach Dhamma to people who don't want the Dhamma. You'll just annoy them, frustrate you. The best thing to do is just smile and endure the fact that they're stupid, that they're harming themselves, that they don't know what they're doing, and they would prefer their misery to you telling them all about how to be happy. Don't try to help them. Be happy. Don't worry about them because you can't fix.

**Speaker E:** Them.

**Speaker A:** I know that that sounds weird, but you probably heard somewhere or another that the teachings of the Buddha are not to be proselytized. We don't go knock on doors like the Jehovah's Witnesses and hand out pamphlets. You don't get any value by getting recruits. And in fact, too many recruits will help destroy the teaching. That this is a very, very select group. You're very, very lucky to have been able to hear the Noble Dhamma, but you'll be even more lucky if you actually practice it. But you will be very unlucky if you try to go give it to somebody who don't want it. Alex, I love your.

**Speaker F:** Answer.

**Speaker B:** Thank.

**Speaker A:** You. Krishna, does that answer your question, or do you have some more?

**Speaker G:** Well, I was asking because I teach meditation. I'm thinking, how much, or how can I teach the Dharma during the meditation?

**Speaker A:** Don't worry, be happy. Say that. What does it last, an hour, 45 minutes? 20 minutes, but— 20 minutes. Okay, that means that in 20 then it's at least 20 times you should say, "Don't worry, be happy." At least 20 times you should be smiling at them and say, "Arahant, I see.

**Speaker F:** That.".

**Speaker A:** But don't try to fix them. In fact, that's an important point also, is that if you'll notice the way in the suttas that the Dharma is taught, is always in the abstract.— is taught by similes, it's taught by metaphor, it's taught by stories, third-person stories, to where psychotherapy is all about the client and what the therapist has to say to the client about the client. Buddhism, correctly taught, is the client is just listening to the stories and can apply them all on his own. Now, there are certain times— and in fact, this is the favorite topic between Ivan and I— is that there are times when the Buddha will not tolerate stupidity among his monks. Mahamoggala was also quite famous for that. When you see a monk that's messing up, you point it out to him right then and there, not tomorrow, but right now. That happened to me big time, taught me one of the most important lessons that I ever had. Because we don't criticize other monks, and here I was as a new monk criticizing a particular Western monk who became Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's translator, but he had never had any real meditation time to where I'd spent 3 years with Goenka already. And so I spouted off that this guy doesn't know anything about meditation. He's translating because he's good with the Thai language, but he doesn't know any Dharma. That very afternoon, I was visited by a delegation of 20 monks. They've deformed the Sangha to Sessa and came to my talk. I came to my kuti and pointed out that monks do not criticize other monks. And so that's an important point, to not criticize or not try to fix somebody, but rather just tell them stories. So that's the way. And another one would be to leave, to live the Dharma. I see that he's just left. So does anybody else have anything.

**Speaker E:** To say? Yeah, I wanted to say something at the end, that like the sutta, it begins saying that all of this is for one who sees, because otherwise if you don't see like Dukkha, you end up wanting to change what you cannot.

**Speaker A:** Change, and that creates more frustration. Precisely so. It's all about that first noble truth. That's the important starting point. Is, can you see the Dukkha? Look again. Can you see it now? Look again. Can you see it now? Look again already. Can you see it now? Over and over and over again. It's a matter of looking and looking and looking until you can clearly see correctly. And once you see correctly, then you can make the choice of whether you could do something about it or not. Okay, so Karuna, did you ever come back? Nah, he's off doing something. Okay, Mikey, let's take this.

**Speaker D:** Thing home. Happily. Yeah, thanks for the talk, and thanks, friends, for being here today. Now feel free to keep hanging out with us here in the Dharma Friends Hangout channel.

### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a group of Sangha friends, is a detailed exploration of the **Sabbāsava Sutta** ("All the Taints," MN 2). The core message is that the Buddha's path provides a complete set of tools to eradicate mental impurities (*āsavas*), and a crucial skill is discerning what you can change from what you cannot.

Here is a structured summary of the key points:

### **1. The Framework: Seven Methods to Eradicate the "Taints" (Āsavas)**
The sutta outlines seven ways to remove mental defilements:
*   **1. By Seeing (Knowledge):** The most profound method. It involves paying **wise attention to the Four Noble Truths**—seeing suffering, its cause, its end, and the path. This understanding eradicates the first three fetters (personality view, doubt, and attachment to rites and rituals), setting the stage for becoming a *Sotāpanna* (stream-enterer).
*   **2. By Restraint:** Guarding the sense doors (especially eyes and ears) from unwholesome inputs (e.g., distracting or harmful content) to prevent unwholesome thoughts and feelings from arising.
*   **3. By Using (the Requisites):** Using the four monastic requisites (food, clothing, shelter, medicine) **wisely**—for nourishment and support, not for pleasure or indulgence.
*   **4. By Enduring:** **Happily enduring** unavoidable physical discomforts (cold, heat, insects, etc.). The emphasis is on joyful acceptance, not grudging tolerance. The photo of monks in the cold illustrates this difference in attitude.
*   **5. By Avoiding:** Actively avoiding dangerous situations and unwholesome environments (wild animals, cliffs, entertainment events, rush-hour traffic) that stir up defilements.
*   **6. By Removing:** **Actively removing** unwholesome mental states (greed, ill will, harmful thoughts) as soon as they arise. This is a key point: **do not merely "endure" negative emotions you can change.** The speaker criticizes meditation systems that teach passive endurance of unwholesome states.
*   **7. By Developing:** Cultivating the **Seven Factors of Awakening** (*sambojjhaṅga*): mindfulness, investigation of phenomena, energy, joy, tranquility, concentration, and equanimity.

### **2. Core Teachings & Emphases**
*   **The Heart of the Practice:** The repeated investigation of the **Four Noble Truths** in the present moment ("Is there *dukkha* right now or not?").
*   **Crucial Wisdom:** Developing the **wisdom to know the difference** between what you **can change** (internal mental states) and what you **cannot change** (external conditions, others' behavior). This aligns with the "Serenity Prayer" concept.
*   **Critique of Misapplied "Endurance":** A major theme is correcting a common misinterpretation. You should **not** passively endure unwholesome thoughts and emotions (which you *can* change). Endurance is for external, unavoidable conditions. The active removal of negative mental states is essential.
*   **Path as Dynamic Skill:** The seven methods are **not a chronological checklist** but a set of tools to be applied as situations demand—knowing "when to hold them, when to fold them, when to walk away, and when to run."
*   **Teaching with Care:** The talk advises against forcefully teaching Dhamma to those not ready for it. It's better to teach through stories, metaphors, and by example ("live the Dharma") rather than direct criticism or proselytizing.

### **3. Interactive Dialogue**
The talk includes questions and comments from participants (Speakers B, C, D, E, F, G), which clarify points such as:
*   The importance of catching unwholesome states early.
*   How the teaching of "welcoming" suffering (as in Ajahn Sumedho's approach) can be understood as a skillful first step to change one's attitude, making it easier to then endure or remove the state.
*   Dhammarato clarifies that teachings like "right effort is no effort" are for advanced practitioners, not beginners who still need to apply deliberate effort to change habits.

### **Overall Essence**
The **Sabbāsava Sutta** provides a comprehensive manual for purifying the mind. The path requires **wise attention** to see reality clearly, the **vigilance** to restrain senses and avoid traps, the **resilience** to endure the unchangeable, the **courage** to remove defilements, and the **dedication** to develop awakening factors. The ultimate goal is a mind of dynamic balance, capable of handling any situation with wisdom and joy.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on your transcript, the talk uses several **metaphors** and references a few **stories** to illustrate the teachings of the Sabbhā-Āsava Sutta.

### **Key Metaphors:**

1.  **Āsava as Physical Impurities:** The speaker describes *āsava* (taints/cankers) using vivid physical metaphors: a **boil**, **pus**, **blackheads**, and an **outflow**. This makes the abstract concept of mental defilements tangible and something that needs to be removed.
2.  **Lancing a Boil:** The knowledge of the Eightfold Noble Path is compared to **lancing a huge boil**. This metaphor emphasizes that wisdom actively eradicates deep-seated defilements.
3.  **Fetters as Bondage:** *Kilesa* (defilements) are compared to **fetters**, **ball and chain**, and being in a **thicket of views**. This conveys the idea of being trapped, restricted, and entangled by wrong views and attachments.
4.  **The Path as a Card Game:** The core teaching of knowing what to change and what to accept is framed using the famous Kenny Rogers song "The Gambler": **"know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, know when to walk away, know when to run."**
    *   **Hold 'em** = Endurance (patiently accepting what you cannot change).
    *   **Fold 'em** = Restraint (knowing when to hold back).
    *   **Walk away** = Avoidance (removing yourself from unwholesome situations).
    *   **Run** = Removal (actively chasing away unwholesome thoughts).
5.  **Jack-in-the-Box:** The development of skill in practice is compared to an old, rusty **jack-in-the-box**. At first, you need effort ("right noble effort") to pull the jack out manually. With practice, the mechanism is restored, and it pops out effortlessly. This explains the difference between a beginner's need for effort and an adept's seemingly effortless skill.

### **Stories and Anecdotes:**

1.  **The Photo of Four Monks in the Cold:** The speaker shows a photo to illustrate "endurance." Four monks stand in freezing weather with vastly different attire (from heavily bundled to just a thin robe). The story contrasts merely *tolerating* the cold (the bundled monks) with *happily enduring* or even enjoying it (the smiling monk in just a robe). This visually demonstrates the attitude shift from grim tolerance to joyful acceptance.
2.  **Ajahn Po and the Hornet:** The speaker recounts a personal story from his time as a young monk. While talking with the arahant Ajahn Po, a large, poisonous hornet landed on Ajahn Po's face. The speaker's instinct was to swat it, but Ajahn Po stopped him, demonstrating perfect **endurance**—remaining calm, undisturbed, and allowing the hornet to leave on its own. This story exemplifies fearlessly accepting a situation that cannot and need not be controlled.
3.  **The Delegation of Monks:** The speaker tells a story of being chastised as a new monk for criticizing another monk's knowledge. A delegation of 20 monks visited him to enforce the rule that **monks do not criticize each other**. This story serves a dual purpose: it's a personal lesson in humility and an object lesson for the audience about the proper way to teach Dhamma—through stories and example, not through criticism or trying to "fix" others.
4.  **Reference to the "Serenity Prayer":** While not a Buddhist story, the speaker references the well-known **AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) prayer** about gaining serenity to accept what you cannot change, courage to change what you can, and wisdom to know the difference. This is used to bridge a familiar Western concept with the Buddha's teaching on wise attention and appropriate action.

### **Summary of Rhetorical Purpose:**
The metaphors make complex Buddhist psychology (**āsava**, **kilesa**, the Path) concrete and memorable. The stories and anecdotes provide real-world, relatable examples of the principles in action, moving the teaching from theory into the realm of lived experience and personal conduct. The "Gambler" metaphor, in particular, serves as a catchy, modern mnemonic for the entire sutta's practical method.
