### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, this is the UK Sangha call and it is June 30th. It is 4 PM in Thailand and morning time sometime, I don't know, in UK. And here we are, we're 8 people here and Thomas has asked a question regarding guilt. He says he feels guilty about things, but he feels that he kind of needs to feel guilty about something in order to want to make a change. Did I get that? You have to feel guilty in order to want to make to have motivation to correct that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's the motivation, and it's also the almost that feeling that you owe it to the other person to feel guilt. See what I mean? Like, it's almost like I shouldn't get off. If I've done something I'm not happy with, I shouldn't get off scot-free. I should— did I almost— that's— yeah. I need to pay my dues. I need to sort of— it's kind of both of those. One is the motivation angle and one is the sense of like, I owe it to somebody to feel guilty. You owe it to someone else.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Guilt is an unwholesome emotion. So it doesn't serve you anything to hold guilt in your mind. Yeah, it's so what was done in.

**Speaker B:** The past.

**Speaker A:** Is nothing you can change. Yeah, it's like that reality has passed, those causes have created their effects already. And there's this new moment now, there's this fresh moment. That we have to accept now. I think we have to understand that we really cannot change the past and we have to just move on as best we can. Hopefully we can learn from that experience. We feel guilt because we we didn't act appropriately, we said something wrong. And so all we can do, from my experience, is just learn from that, learn from that bad deed that we did. And hopefully we can correct that and.

**Speaker B:** Not.

**Speaker A:** Do that again. Whenever guilt arises, we just have to have Sati. We have to see it and just acknowledge it and be okay with it. Just accept it and just take a deep breath and you can just let it go. That's all you have to do. Acknowledge the reality of the guilt and then come back to being guiltless, the guiltless reality of this moment. Yeah. Anyone else have anything to add? That's just my view.

**Speaker D:** One thing about maybe Building wholesome thoughts upon that is maybe just recognizing when you see the guilt, "Ah, I see that. What a relief. Now the next time I don't have to do what I did again. How wonderful, I don't have to.".

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Yeah, yeah. Have wholesome thoughts too. Yeah, you can create wholesome thoughts. Yes, next time I don't have to do that like that again. Yeah, thank you, Thomas. Thank you, Amit. Go ahead.

**Speaker E:** Yes, I just want to add, these days, some time back I was listening to one of the talks by Shinjin Young. Maybe some of you know him. He's a Zen meditation teacher, quite well known, and he was talking about don't know mind, to cultivate don't know mind and to be comfortable with it. Right, beginner's mind, don't know mind. And Dhammarato also talks a lot about that, don't have to know things and we stay comfortable with it. And I'm practicing it time to time. And there are some thoughts, and then I practice, do I know, I don't know it, right? And I was thinking maybe it can also applicable for guilt, right? So you feel guilty about something, but you're not sure whether this was wrong or right, right? So this is something, wondering maybe.

**Speaker C:** Which.

**Speaker E:** Might be useful, just practicing, okay, I don't know, did I do wrong, did I do wrong, I don't know. And also, you know, just Trying to learn to be comfortable with that and learning to be comfortable that, okay, I don't also have to know.

**Speaker A:** Cultivate don't-know mayans. Yeah, you don't have to know. You don't have to know about what the other person thinks of you. Yeah, you don't need to know that. It's not important.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, my understanding is with this don't know mind, maybe, you know, there are different understandings, and my understanding is deep enough yet, but hopefully, hopefully there is some truth to it. But my understanding is don't know mind is taking you out of the talk, because it's taking you out of these thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Taking out of the thoughts, yeah.

**Speaker E:** Thinking, Anapanasati, is happening in a thought, okay? This is a thought and I want to, you know, know is like a thought in the mind which wants to know something. You are coming out of the thought, right? So you are still knowing, you are seeing what's happening around you, but this knowledge is different from a knowledge, the thought knowledge, right?

**Speaker A:** Okay, yeah, don't know mind, yeah. It's not a thought knowledge, but like a knowingness.

**Speaker F:** About.

**Speaker A:** One'S experience. Yeah.

**Speaker C:** I think I want to add back on the guilt. The way we perceive guilt is this depth we carry with ourselves that we have this kind of responsibility for others and for the situations that may be caused. But once we realize that this depth is not really helping us to solve them, we're actually just creating more problems by thinking about them and creating more scenarios. How could I have done this better? Maybe next time I can prevent it. You're re-embracing the same pattern to come back to. So we're trying to not correct the past mistakes, but actually change the present moment. And by changing the present moment, we can correct the future pathways and not associating with guilt so strongly. We can see it maybe from a bit further and further and further. So guilt is one of those emotions that you immediately can see and you can see, oh, this is not healthy, this is not necessary because I know nothing is going to change of me feeling guilty about it or feeling guilty for other person.

**Speaker A:** So nothing will come about from feeling guilt. I don't think the other person who you feel guilty over is going to care if you feel guilty.

**Speaker C:** Quite the opposite. They probably want to see you smile and to see that like this situation is a bit brighter than what you're both probably making. If one person is feeling guilt but other person can be okay with it, kind of neutralizes the dynamic, you can say. Instead of having two losers just crying about it, oh, we could have fixed this, we could have done this, one of them says, let's move on, let's go ahead, let's be right here and now. Let's not resist it, but let's not dwell on it as well.

**Speaker B:** You're kind of saying that if you If you dwell on it, then you're maintaining that kind of attachment to that behavior. Is that right? And you're identifying yourself with that behavior. So the longer you dwell on it, then the more difficult it is to separate yourself from that behavior in the present moment. As a result, the more likely you are to do it again in the future. Is that right?

**Speaker C:** It's a habit. It's a habit you learned in your childhood, probably far away where you can't even remember when you did something and you upset mommy or upset daddy, and now daddy's giving you a harsh word that you didn't know existed. And then you learn these behaviors through correct mistakes, to say the right things, to be always right, to always want not to offend anyone, to not be guilty of any wrongdoing. And with that, you're always walking on these like little shells, and by that you create more guilt because you're like, I need to be careful with this person, I need to be careful with this. So you're automatically creating guilt by telling yourself, oh, I need to be careful in the world, I need to not You're not allowing yourself to kind of, as you say, you're not allowing yourself to feel okay when something goes wrong. That's what guilt is. It's just not being okay with it. And that creates further, further, further guilt. So you're not really escaping guilt, but creating more guilt over feeling guilty. And it's going on and on. That's how I see it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, guilt is an interesting emotion. It's like we feel guilty because we think we can, we think we can correct something we did in the past. We have the belief that we can correct something. Like if we knew completely that we couldn't fix the past, then would we still feel guilty, you think?

**Speaker C:** There's a tremendous, tremendous pleasure we get from feeling guilty as well. You have to see the pleasure you get from feeling guilty. Like as soon as you see that it gives you so much pleasure, then it doesn't become that that dangerous because you're able to see both sides of it. You're able to see like, okay, I was like this and I'm now feeling guilty and I like all these feelings and feeling that comes with guilt. But you can also see the danger as well in it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it has a sweetness to it. Like many unwholesome emotions do have a sweetness to them that makes the mind want to dwell in them, I think. Yeah, guilt, that's a good point, Carl. Yeah, it has that quality. Yeah, it's like a sweet melancholy. But we have to let it go, I think. We just have to like see it. Yeah, we have to see it as just for what it is. It's just arises in the mind, just arising phenomena. Yeah, don't stick with it, don't cling to it, just see it and let it go. Yeah, just come back, come back to this happy moment here.

**Speaker E:** One question.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker E:** I mean, can we put guilt in a framework of the five hindrances? And if we— which which one would it be? So I just— Carl said, you know, there is some kind of sweetness to it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there's this—.

**Speaker E:** What'S your take on it?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, if there's a sweetness to it, if there's a pleasure to it, then yeah, it definitely falls under sense desire. And is it also aversion too? We don't like what is present. We don't like this reality. It's some aversion to this present moment. We want to change the past. We're trying to, we're dwelling on the past and we feel bad about the past. Yeah, it's the mind can't just be with the present. So it's aversion too.

**Speaker G:** Ill will.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so now is it restlessness? Is it also restlessness and worry? Yeah, it's also restlessness and worry. And is it doubt? Is it also doubt? Yeah, we're not sure, we're unsure, like we're unsure about the past, we're unsure about the present. It's like, yeah, absolutely.

**Speaker C:** We're not sure if what we did was right or what we did was wrong. We're always looking for that reassurance. Oh, is this right? Oh, is this wrong? Is this right? And that's the process you keep replaying that we're trying to come out of. That's the habit that we learned. Is this right? Is this right? Am I doing it right? Am I okay? Am I not okay? And it's constantly, constantly replaying whenever we feel guilt.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, yes, exactly. And so with sense desire, it's aversion. Is it It's also sloth and torpor. Is it like a laziness? Yes, I think it is. It's like when we have it in our mind, it's like it bogs down our minds. It weighs down our minds. It makes the mind sluggish. It's like thick. Smog in the mind. Yeah. It's like the soup we like to marinate in. Like this, the mind likes to just marinate in this guilt. Yeah, so I would say it seems like it's all 5 hindrances. Guilt, Anicca, 5 in 1. Yeah, when, yeah, yeah, like everyone knows guilt. Everyone feels guilty from time to time. Yeah, even myself, even my mind. I, the guilt sometimes arises in my mind. Yeah, it's like I don't feel good about things that I've done in the past. Yeah, I wish it could have been different, but that's just how it was. That's how reality, how things turned out. So I can't change it. I just have to really accept that. That I really honestly cannot change the past, and I just accept the guilt. Yeah, just acknowledge it and just come back. Yeah, hopefully that you won't do anything again that will create guilt, make guilt arise in your mind. Does that help you, Thomas? Thomas Graham? Yeah, insights.

**Speaker C:** Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Everybody's insight's super helpful. I've been taking some notes, but yeah, I appreciate it. Great answers.

**Speaker A:** Okay, good.

**Speaker C:** Are you still feeling guilty right now? That's my question. In this moment, are you still feeling guilty as well? Talking about guilt?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no, a lot, a lot less actually. Um, I've listened to some talks from Dhammarato as well earlier today on, on guilt, and it is, um, it, yeah, it's, it is I mean, I'm still a little bit weighed down by it, but a lot less than I normally would be. And so that in itself is quite encouraging, right?

**Speaker C:** When you think— Congratulations.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, it's not as bad. I'm able to— and I just think this Sangha in general, right, it's really— it really encourages you to take ownership of your thoughts, which then influence your feelings. So, you know, it's very much a proactive practice, and I've been trying to remind myself all day of that. So yeah, I'm relatively light compared to what I might be without these teachings. I can definitely say that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And even more so after joining this Sangha. So thank you.

**Speaker A:** Nice. Happy to hear a success story. Nice. Anyone else have a question or discussion points? Or want to talk about anything Dharma, about their practice, or talk about Dhamma or Buddhism. Actually, I actually, I make a distinction between Dhamma and Buddhism personally, and we can talk about either.

**Speaker E:** Me, I would like to know what.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, go ahead, Amit.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, go ahead, Amit.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, maybe in one point, my side would be if you can explain the distinction between Dharma and Buddhism.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that's a good question. Yeah, this is just my distinction personally. It's probably other people's distinction too. But the Dhamma to me is really the teachings of the Buddha. It's the Dharma. It's what the Buddha taught back in the Buddha's day. And Buddhism is more of what has evolved since then that we see now in present time. We see Buddhism, we see Buddhist traditions, right? We see many different Buddhist traditions that all teach the Dhamma, but they have many— it's kind of become a religion rather than more of a teaching. Yeah, Buddhism is actually, it's a modern term too. It only came about in the last few hundred years. The term Buddhism. Yeah, we see the Dharma has evolved into a religion. You could say it's now Buddhism. So that's what I would say is the distinction there. Dharma encompasses the original teachings of the Buddha, and Buddhism is sort of the evolution of the Dharma that's become the religion, the Buddhist religion. Does that answer? Is that satisfactory?

**Speaker E:** Thanks, David.

**Speaker A:** Okay, no problem.

**Speaker C:** I think the good term of like Buddhism is Buddhism is an ism, is trying to be something. Buddhism is trying to be something, and Dhamma is actually practicing being Buddha. It's practice, actually doing the work instead of dancing around and dancing rituals.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. We see many extraneous things that have come about in the name of Buddhism these days. We see many things that have shrouded the Dharma. It's why many people don't really understand the Dharma these days, because all they see is Buddhism. They don't see the Dharma, they don't understand the real teachings of the Buddha. Yeah, it's not easy to find nowadays, actually, because when you see Buddhism, you see all the outward appearances that have arisen from the Dhamma. You see all the religious icons, the rituals, and even like culture has seeped into Buddhism big time. You see all the culture.

**Speaker C:** You were saying culture, and as far as like culture is, because Buddhism signifies poverty, is this kind of poverty way of living to people, like, oh, you have no money, you're wearing orange robe, and you're sitting in the temples. Meanwhile, the whole society is driving towards the other end of having more, needing more, building upon. So the Buddhism is already kind of being rejected in those terms already. When most people come to it, they say that's like, oh, this is a poverty. All religions are essentially some kind of poverty. They have that aspect of your life being smaller if you practice it. Like, you have to toss away a lot of unnecessary things, give away. Meanwhile, the Dhamma is completely opposite. It kind of gives you everything.

**Speaker E:** Let me ask you, what was he in the Anagami?

**Speaker C:** Excuse me, Amit, what were you saying?

**Speaker A:** I meant you said something a minute ago, a second ago. Amit?

**Speaker C:** I think he just forgot to mute.

**Speaker A:** We can't hear you, Amit.

**Speaker F:** Ben and Tomas had a topic or question they wanted to talk about.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I.

**Speaker G:** Just adding on to the previous, I heard there's a Tibetan or Australian Tibetan nun called Robina Courtland who says that it's all about being your own therapist. I like that analogy of what we can sort of— what the Dhamma is for.

**Speaker A:** It's like being a therapist, like being your own therapist. Being your own therapist. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, like being your own psychotherapist. Yeah, it is. And the Buddha is often often compared to be the ancient psychotherapist. He's often compared to be a doctor of sorts that heals the ills of the mind. So the Dhamma, that's a good analogy. Yeah, to be one's therapist.

**Speaker G:** It's been— what I've learned so far from Dhammarato has been helpful with my anxiety struggle. Well, I have anxiety sometimes about specific things, and currently I've got a sort of to make a decision, and there's two different paths to go down, both of which have different challenges, both of which bring up large amounts of anxiety when I bring them into the now or think about them.

**Speaker E:** And.

**Speaker G:** It can be comforting to— it can be, if I can remain present and just be aware that everything now is okay, everything now is fine, then I feel okay. But I struggle. I don't know how people— anyone has any tips on sort of making big decisions without sort of drifting off into the future and being able to be present now but still think enough to be able to make the decision, if that makes sense.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wow. So you have a choice, you have to make a choice between two choices, two big choices. And both of those are causing you anxiety. And you're not really sure which one to pick. And you're often thinking about the future in regards to both of those choices.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, but what I've learned so far did help. Yesterday I could sort of feel a panic attack coming on, and I managed to sort of argue with it for a while while sort of trying to keep it at bay, but then it eventually happened. But throughout it, I could be sort of more comfortable with it and just be present while it happened. And it wasn't nearly as bad as they have been before. So that, it does really help. And then I managed to stop another one before it started. But just, yeah, trying to make decisions when the future's uncertain, the present's fine, the present's perfectly fine. Is the future that I struggle with.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's not really the future that is the struggle though, I think it's more the thoughts of the future. Yeah, you just have to see those thoughts of the future You really have to see them. And just, it's really, when those thoughts of the future come, it's really a delusion. It's like a delusion. Yeah. Yeah, just, you really have to see them, have Sati. Really important to have Sati when those thoughts come. Because otherwise you're going to spin out into, like you said, like anxiety, panic attack, etc. Yeah, you really have to catch them like as they appear and just sit with them. As long as they stay around, you can just breathe into them, you can take some deep breaths. Just take some long deep breaths. And yeah, they should just disappear and just come back to this moment, just come back to wholesome, this wholesome present moment. You can congratulate yourself as well when you come back and say, yeah, everything's all right, right here, this is it. It's all good, no problems, you know. I'm not in pain, I'm not starving, hungry, I'm, you know, everything is okay. I'm not really, it's the mind, it always thinks it's always getting lost in like stories. It always wants to spin out in stories. It's always trying to scheme things in the future. It's just like a trickster. It's like a Mara. It's really like you really have to— this is why we practice, because it's like the devil. We're fighting our own devils. We have a devil in our mind and we have to exorcise it. Yeah. So.

**Speaker C:** I think anxiety is also important to see as you said, the devil, the thoughts themselves seem harmful at times, but they're also there because It's a mechanism we learn for a certain reason, and they're there for protection of us. Like, the anxiety doesn't arise just because we decided today is the day I'm gonna— like the sunshine— I'm gonna just show up. It's there because there's some kind of thought that instigates it. There's some kind of insecurity, uncertainty in yourself that you don't feel okay being here now, about your survival right now, that you have to make this choice for the future and then I'm gonna be okay. So it's all this feeling, this pushing away of this anxiety, is trying to get rid of it actually, thinking like if I get rid of it, then I can make a choice instead of flipping on it and seeing how it can be beneficial to you. How is this anxiety actually beneficial to feel? How it has been nurturing you so far and kept you alive and well up until this point? You're here, still here. And that way you become more present. You can see that it hasn't harmed you up until this far. It hasn't caused you to have any accidents. You're still okay. You're still here. You're still safe. And you go with that. You don't fight it because if you start fighting it, if you think this is a battle, it's going to fight back. It's going to come back with, as you said, panic attacks. It's going to come back even more. Because it wants to be recognized. It wants to be recognized for what it is instead of being deemed as this negative emotion.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, that's another thing. Yeah, we have to be okay with whatever unwholesome emotion arises. Yeah, don't see it as an enemy. Yeah, we can just be cool with whatever arises. Don't push away it, don't push away it, don't fuel it. Yeah, because when we are averse to whatever arises, we're like fueling it.

**Speaker C:** Or.

**Speaker A:** Really giving it fuel. Fuel to stay around, to come back. It's like we have to just accept it, be equanimous with it, and yeah, just let it, release it.

**Speaker F:** It doesn't even matter too much which choice you make. It's more about can you make that choice happily? You know, whichever you decide to do, you know, you can't decide if you want to stay at your job or if you want to leave your job. And, you know, it's like, well, it doesn't really matter. It's like, well, if you decide that you can stay at your job, can you stay at your job happily? If you decide you want to leave your job, can you leave and give the boss a smile on your way out the door? This is what it means to come back to the practice, you know. As Dhammarato often says, is we want to get it right, but we don't need to worry about that so much. We're going to make mistakes. That's okay. It's not a big deal. There's no reason to be hard on ourselves. This actually comes back to what Thomas was talking about with guilt, right? We get anxious because we don't want to feel guilty later. But if we can practice not being guilty, then there's nothing to be anxious about.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, like the important thing is, can you be happy with whatever choice you make? That's the important thing. It's not so much the choice.

**Speaker D:** One thing also about decisions, something to play with, is One thing to try is making a phrase, "I will do X," and "I will not do X," and then maybe saying one phrase for a few minutes and really going into the body to see how the body feels, and then switching to the other phrase, and then listening to the body, how that feels. Sometimes there could be some maybe beneficial input found there. Also could be done with some kind of visual imagery, imagination, but then that will be going into the future and going into kind of fantasy, but those are also options to maybe play with and see what comes up.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, anxiety is an interesting emotion. It's like complex. It seems to be one of the more complex emotions. It's like, it's also usually very bodily. It feels very physical. Yeah, so you can explore it in your body when it arises. You can just feel it, feel it out in the body. Where is it? Yeah, like you can be like a scientist.

**Speaker E:** With it.

**Speaker A:** Explore it, move it. You can move it around. Can you move it? Yeah, try. Try exploring it, playing with it.

**Speaker F:** It's another toy to play with, yeah.

**Speaker A:** It's a toy, yeah.

**Speaker D:** Thanks everyone. So one point that could be explored In my practice, I've noticed a clear preference in closing the eyes. And then when keeping the eyes open, there's easily this kind of dissatisfaction coming, and that I just rather close my eyes, and it's easy to go to bliss and really pleasant sensations. And then how to kind of integrate that to come into the seeing sense as well.

**Speaker A:** You notice when you close your eyes, you feel a pleasantness that you don't get when you open your eyes.

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And you're wondering how to retain that when your eyes are open. Interesting. Yeah, it's like when we close our eyes, it's like the mind, it naturally gets calmer, I think, because the sensory information is like one of the sense doors just drops away. Yeah, it is like more relaxing. To have one's eyes closed. And yeah, when I practice, when I do formal practice, I like to close my eyes. Yeah. And so, and then I think a.

**Speaker C:** Good way is also, would you prefer to be blind in other ways? If you have the choice, would you prefer to be blind and not see at all? So we really can look at seeing and enjoy the seeing, enjoy the eyes instead of seeing it as a troublesome attitude, like, oh, it's making me not focus so much, I cannot be pleasant. Well, then look where you're not finding pleasure in seeing. Do you really not want to see anything at all forever for the rest of your life? So you have to integrate into your practice as well as far as like looking at the trees, looking at the branches, looking out at objects that give you sensory pleasure. There is a lot out here in the world that's happening, not just behind our closed eyes. There is still the world there. You don't have to completely shut yourself off and go sit in a cave. There's pleasure to be had in seeing. Right.

**Speaker A:** There is pleasure to be had wherever you are. I think that's a quote by Dhammarato or the Buddha.

**Speaker F:** Do you remember what sutta that was in reference to?

**Speaker A:** I think he found it on the chat. Yeah, I don't remember.

**Speaker F:** We were looking for it again. That's okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, it's a practice to find satisfaction wherever you are, however you are. Eyes closed, eyes open. Yeah. But I do find like when I do formal practice, to close my eyes really helps to cultivate the pleasantness, the Piti, Sukkha. I find it comes easier when I shut my sense doors. And then, yeah, when you open your eyes again, you can still retain that pleasantness. I don't think it should disappear right away. It should linger. Yeah, I think.

**Speaker C:** Like there's somebody coming with a knife at you.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, I can also practice having the eyes just a little bit open too. Don't have to have them all the way closed, so you can kind of gently come out of your formal practice in that way.

**Speaker C:** Isn't— sorry guys, I wanted to ask a question— isn't it like the Buddha's eyes is always like half open, half closed? He's always looking down, so even the statue itself indicates it's neither closed neither open. It's not to go to extremes of both ways.

**Speaker F:** But yeah, you could also, like Carl was saying earlier, you can practice being blind if you want. There's plenty of blind and happy people out there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, whatever works, whatever benefits you, you can go with that. Yeah.

**Speaker E:** Just want to add one thing. Can you guys hear me? Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yes, we can hear you.

**Speaker F:** I can hear you.

**Speaker E:** Anagami, Arhat, Bhikkhuni. Yeah, I have a bit of internet issues. So let's see how long. So, okay. So just want to say one thing. I mean, there is also this meditation style called open awareness. And I got it from Rob Bourbia's book. Book. And I'm also practicing from Gaia House where Bhavana was. So there's one teacher who is giving weekly course, so one on Monday. And this meditation style is actually kind of works, I would say, even better with the open eyes. So the idea is just you are taking all the senses in and trying to think, imagine mind is like a sky and things are coming and disappearing like like in the sky, but sky is stable, it's always there, it's not rejecting or accepting anything. And yeah, this is kind of— and in the past I also used to do always meditation with closed eyes, and as David said, for me also it works better to have the pleasure. But now with this, I'm doing this style for a while, and this I think is quite helpful for me. Also because, you know, most of the time your eyes open and like in work and also it's easy to integrate this, this style of meditation. And what they do is they try to get sense of like a space. Let's say now I am looking at the, at my screen, there's a space between me and the screen, and you develop this sense of that. And somehow it really looks very weird. If you have not done it, but somehow it's possible for mind to develop it, and it can be quite fun.

**Speaker A:** Interesting. May I ask, so it's like just open awareness. You said it's like the sky. So you're not pushing away anything, you're not accepting anything. It's just very equanimous.

**Speaker C:** With experience.

**Speaker E:** Yes, and this kind of also says there, like when I was reading Bhikkhuni's book, there are these three characteristics, right? Anicca, Anatta, and Dukkha. And as you develop these three characteristics, this particular openness is the result of that. But he also said if you are specifically developing this open sky-like mind kind of awareness, this meditation style. So this also helps developing the three characteristics. So they are like.

**Speaker A:** Pregnant. May I ask, what do you mean by developing the three characteristics?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, if you are practicing with equanimity, right? So yeah, you're practicing with Anicca. So whatever is happening, you say, okay, this is Anicca. You know, you have like a bit of a pain, or this is just impermanence, right? And this is a style of this. And I did this Goenka practice for a while. And so Goenka is pretty big in this, right? So you have pain, but it's just nature. And so this is like developing Anicca, this lens of looking at phenomena with this Anicca insight. And there's also inside, whatever is happening, there is no self. It's no self. And it means at least, you know, it could be he talks this, how you can develop these three things. And this will automatically will develop your sky, sky-like awareness. And he also say looking at a sky along, this also help. Just visualize sky and try to, try to feel how sky, how things are just coming and going. He also said talking about first Jhana.

**Speaker C:** I mean, that's just like talking about getting into first jhana. He's just describing the first jhana, what's happening in the first jhana.

**Speaker E:** It's more fifth and sixth jhana, he say, you know, like. Because fifth jhana is like your, it's like a space, right? Infinity or boundless space. Fifth jhana and sixth jhana is boundless awareness. And at least in the book, Bhikkhuni said that this is what's happening Like Jhana state is like much more, much more profound and require much more practice. But this is like a non-Jhanic space. It's like a similar kind of a space, but it's not as strong as Jhana. It's going to take you that direction.

**Speaker C:** It sounds like an absorption state. Whenever I hear these guys talk about awareness and stations, it's usually more to do with absorption jhanas, the ones where you're not able to talk or move. As you said, you look at the sky and you contemplate on the sky, etc. But it sounds like it's still the practice of feeling good and climbing into those higher Jhanas, well, with your eyes open.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, with this Jhana state, yeah, you are going more in the direction of absorption, but with this, the open awareness meditation, So it's not going so far as you are completely absorbed, like you have a sense of a space, but you also have a sense of— if you're talking to somebody, you also have a sense of listening. So daily life kind of thing. And I think this is also a lot A lot of these Bhikkhunis are participating. I was also visiting Sukkha, Bhavana, Bhikkhu, Bhante, and this doctor and all to talk a lot about this kind of—.

**Speaker A:** Amit, your microphone is really, really poor.

**Speaker B:** Sorry.

**Speaker E:** Can you hear me now? Okay, or not?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, we can hear you, but sometimes it cuts out.

**Speaker E:** Okay, I will make it really short. And then I was just saying that I was reading also somewhat about the Tibetan practice, Dzogchen and all. And those guys are also kind of quite big in developing this kind of meditation with open eyes and open awareness. It's really not going all the way to Jhana, but you know, it's in that territory.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. May I ask, what if the open awareness has got some storm clouds, dark storm clouds appear in this open awareness? By that I mean, what if like there's a lot of unwholesomeness that appears, what does one do?

**Speaker E:** In the practice which I'm doing with the teacher, And there actually they say, yeah, if there's dark clouds, you notice them, but you also notice, you know, they are like a little part of the whole sky. There are also bright clouds there, and there are also no clouds there, right? So it's going into like, okay, there are dark clouds, but they are like clouds. They are not self. Developing this Anatta perception. And you are really not— I think a lot of time the problem is you have a dark cloud, but then you get hooked into it. Yeah, you are not doing it because that cloud is just one part of your experience, right? And you are letting all other parts of experience also to show up. So you are trying to not cling to any particular part.

**Speaker C:** I just started practicing. You're throwing out. You're still doing the throwing out method of where you're throwing out the cloud as not being useful to dwell in it. So it's still kind of all the same, it's just a quicker process. You don't dwell on the clouds, you see them as they're passing. It's the same thing we talked about, anxiety is not dwelling on anxiety, but see where it's taking you, it's being with it.

**Speaker E:** Yes, yes, definitely. That's definitely a big part, that you are really not dwelling into any particular cloud, right? And you are throwing out and then you let your attention to see the whole space and not fix it in one cloud.

**Speaker A:** I'm not sure. I think Dhammarato has been critical of that method in the past. I think because it's not directly making the change that is needed when the unwholesomeness comes, I think there's the possibility we linger too long in the unwholesomeness. That's the— I think that could be a downside, is that we're not making the change. Yeah, we need to— There's just like.

**Speaker C:** A lot of language to unpack in there, in those statements, in these meditations. That's what goes mistranslated. They're all doing the same thing as Anapanasati, but they're not actually giving you the method as direct as Anapanasati does. It gives you like something to look forward to. They tell you like, hey, this is what you should be looking forward to, and this is what you should be experiencing. But if you catch yourself sitting there and not experiencing of it, then you start creating guilt. So that's why these methods become harmful sometimes, but they can also work if if you already have that structure of a certain skill, you can already, as Dhammarato says, tap into that energy of like everything is okay, everything is passing by, and that's what we call open awareness, or whatever they call open awareness. I don't call it, but that's just like, again, it kind of jumps into first Jhana territory of where we're still able to interact with the world, but we're in a pleasant satisfied state and we're seeing everything as pleasant arising, pleasant coming into our senses.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I definitely, definitely agree with this point.

**Speaker C:** Karl.

**Speaker E:** It's like more of the language thing. And I think it's from my, because I practice mostly Dhammarato's method, right? What I practice, and now I'm doing this open awareness. It could be because I'm doing Dhammarato's mode of practice. Possibly maybe I am Upadana, Anapanasati. Yeah, there are a lot of similarities, but definitely I find there is a lot of similarities. And you know, in Dhammarato's method, you are also actively trying to unhook yourself from these moods.

**Speaker G:** Here you are also actively trying because.

**Speaker B:** Intention has a cause and effect.

**Speaker F:** We're having some trouble hearing you. Amit.

**Speaker E:** Sorry for that, guys. I think I will just listen now. So, okay, yeah, that's fine.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Oh, and, uh, I, I should mention, Amit, that's not the first time I've noticed technical problems with your mic, so maybe I think you should look into it.

**Speaker E:** Okay, thanks, thanks a lot. Is it, is it better now? Now something improved?

**Speaker A:** Uh, yeah, we can hear you. I can hear.

**Speaker E:** Uh, okay, yeah, I brought a little bit closer, but thanks for, thanks for, uh, for this. I will, I will try to make sure my mic is, uh, better next time.

**Speaker A:** Okay, yeah, thanks for sharing.

**Speaker E:** Whenever it's not good, just let me know. Uh, just a good quick feedback would be useful.

**Speaker A:** Okay, thanks a lot.

**Speaker F:** One thing I would like to say is, you know, we don't really need to have our head in the clouds. You know, and I don't— I wasn't super clear on the method you're describing, so there may be a lot of benefit to it, right? But I would like to point to that this practice of Anapanasati is really bringing us to what we're experiencing right here, right now. And that's what we can change, right? We can't change the clouds. Yes, we can look at them and be satisfied with the way that they are, right? You know, but, you know, looking at a dark storm cloud there's no rain yet, you know, that cloud is still in the distance, it's still away from us, right, you know, and we don't need to fixate on it or worry about it so much. But when we see, oh, it's raining now, then we can go inside or pull out the umbrella or what have you, you know, or just enjoy getting wet. So yeah, and this is why we emphasize bringing the mind to the present experience, because that's as close to reality as what we can get, right? You know, we can't ever be fully present because the mind's always lagging behind a bit. Right? You know, but if we practice bringing ourselves into what is happening right now and paying attention to what we're doing, what our mind is doing, then it's easier for us to catch the mind when it has unwholesome thoughts and to train the mind to have wholesome thoughts right now. Because we can't change last Tuesday's thoughts And we don't know what we're going to be thinking about next Tuesday. So let's just be happy and satisfied now. Yeah, this is the first Jhana, and that is freedom right there. Happy and satisfaction and at peace right now. What more freedom do you need than that?

**Speaker A:** Yep, always come back to this moment, fresh moment, this pleasant moment. Yeah, it's like, this is all you're gonna get.

**Speaker C:** That's good, that's good.

**Speaker A:** Okay, anyone have anything else they want to talk about? Any questions?

**Speaker F:** David, thank you so much for hosting this call today, and thank you everyone for being here. This has been a really pleasant talk, very delightful. Glad to see my friends, and yeah, take care everyone.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, thank you Michael, thank you for the opportunity to host, and lovely to see everyone here. Great, great time. I hope to see everyone back again next week. And Dhammarato, I hope he's feeling great, energized. Yeah, awesome. Thank you, guys.

**Speaker E:** Thank you.

**Speaker G:** Thank you.

**Speaker C:** Everyone.

**Speaker D:** Thank you.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, hosted by David (Speaker A) for the UK Sangha, centered on a practical discussion of common mental obstacles in meditation and daily life, guided by the teachings of Dhammarato. The conversation flowed through several key themes:

**1.  Guilt (The Initial Question):**
Thomas (Speaker B) raised the topic, expressing a sense that guilt is needed as motivation for change and a feeling of "owing" it to others. The group's consensus, led by David, was that **guilt is an unwholesome emotion** that belongs to the past, which cannot be changed. The practical advice was to:
*   **Acknowledge guilt with mindfulness (Sati)** when it arises, then let it go.
*   **Learn from the past action** and resolve not to repeat it, but to do so from a place of wholesome intention, not guilt.
*   Recognize that dwelling on guilt **reinforces the very habit pattern** one wants to change.
*   Carl (Speaker C) insightfully noted that guilt can have a hidden **"sweetness" or pleasure**, making it seductive to dwell in.
*   The group analyzed guilt through the lens of the **Five Hindrances**, concluding it contains elements of all five: sense desire (for the "sweet" feeling), aversion (to the past action), restlessness/worry, doubt, and sloth/torpor (weighing the mind down).

**2.  Anxiety and Decision-Making:**
Ben (Speaker G) shared his struggle with anxiety when facing a major life decision, causing him to get lost in fearful future thoughts. The advice focused on **staying present**:
*   See anxious thoughts about the future as **delusion**.
*   **Catch them with Sati**, breathe deeply, and return to the safety and okay-ness of the present moment.
*   **Don't fight the anxiety**; explore it in the body with curiosity and recognize it as an old protective mechanism.
*   Michael (Speaker F) emphasized that the **primary goal is to make any choice happily**; the specific path matters less than the peaceful mind from which you choose.

**3.  Distinction Between Dhamma and Buddhism:**
In response to Amit's (Speaker E) question, David distinguished the two:
*   **Dhamma:** The original, practical teachings of the Buddha on ending suffering.
*   **Buddhism:** The later-evolving religion, with its cultural rituals, icons, and institutional forms, which can sometimes obscure the core Dhamma.

**4.  Meditation Techniques: Integrating Eyes-Open Awareness**
Amit and others discussed the practice of **"open awareness" or "sky-like" meditation**, where one rests in a spacious, equanimous awareness with eyes open, observing all sensory experiences (thoughts, sights, sounds) as passing clouds.
*   The group related this to the **Jhanas** (specifically the formless realms of infinite space and consciousness) but as a lighter, more integrated daily-life practice.
*   David and Carl gently cautioned that without a strong foundation in actively cultivating wholesome states (like in **Ānāpānasati**), such open awareness runs the risk of passively lingering in unwholesome states ("dark clouds") rather than skillfully abandoning them.
*   The core message remained: whatever the technique, the aim is to **cultivate happiness and satisfaction in the present moment**, which is the essence of the first Jhana and the heart of the practice.

**Overall Summary:**
The talk was a supportive, Sangha-based exploration of applying Dhamma principles to everyday mental challenges. The recurring solution offered was to **use mindfulness to recognize unwholesome states like guilt and anxiety, understand their drawbacks, and gently but firmly return the mind to cultivating wholesome, peaceful, and satisfied states in the ever-available present moment.** The tone was practical, non-dogmatic, and emphasized personal experimentation and kindness towards oneself.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several metaphors and stories to explain Dhamma concepts, particularly around guilt, anxiety, and meditation practice. Here are the key ones:

**1. The Metaphor of Debt or Payment (for Guilt)**
*   **Speaker B** describes guilt as feeling like you **"owe it to somebody"** and that you need to **"pay your dues."** This frames guilt as a transactional debt from a past wrong that must be settled through suffering.

**2. The Metaphor of Weather & The Sky (for Thoughts and Awareness)**
*   This is the most developed set of metaphors, used by multiple speakers.
    *   **Speaker A** describes guilt bogging down the mind like **"thick smog."**
    *   **Speaker E** introduces the **"open awareness"** meditation style, where the mind is like a **sky** and thoughts/feelings are **clouds** (both dark and bright) that appear and pass without affecting the sky's fundamental nature.
    *   **Speaker F** builds on this, advising not to have your **"head in the clouds,"** and to deal with thoughts practically: *"looking at a dark storm cloud... when we see, oh, it's raining now, then we can go inside or pull out the umbrella."*

**3. The Metaphor of Marination or Soup (for Dwelling in Emotions)**
*   **Speaker A** says the mind likes to **"marinate in this guilt"** and later calls it **"the soup we like to marinate in."** This emphasizes how the mind can habitually soak in and identify with unwholesome emotions, finding a perverse pleasure in them.

**4. The Metaphor of a Therapist or Doctor (for the Dhamma Practice)**
*   **Speaker G** mentions the saying (from Robina Courtin) that the practice is about **"being your own therapist."**
*   **Speaker A** expands this, saying the Buddha is often compared to **"the ancient psychotherapist"** or a **"doctor of sorts that heals the ills of the mind."** This frames the Dhamma as a practical, therapeutic process for mental well-being.

**5. The Metaphor of a Devil or Exorcism (for Unwholesome Thoughts)**
*   **Speaker A** describes the anxious, scheming mind as a **"trickster,"** **"Mara,"** and **"the devil."** He says practicing is like **"fighting our own devils"** and that **"we have to exorcise it."** This dramatizes the internal struggle against habitual negative patterns.

**6. The Metaphor of a Toy or Scientific Exploration (for Relating to Emotions)**
*   **Speaker A** and **Speaker F** suggest exploring anxiety like a **"scientist"** or a **"toy."** Instead of fighting it, you can **"feel it out,"** **"move it around,"** and **"play with it."** This encourages a curious, non-aversive relationship to difficult emotions.

**7. The Metaphor of a Pathway or Habit Loop (for Mental Patterns)**
*   **Speaker C** describes guilt and anxiety as a **"habit"** learned in childhood, a **"pattern"** we keep replaying. He uses the imagery of **"walking on... little shells"**—being overly careful to avoid guilt, which ironically creates more tension and guilt. This metaphor illustrates how mental habits create self-reinforcing cycles.

**8. The Story of Childhood Conditioning (for the Origin of Guilt)**
*   While not a formal story, **Speaker C** provides a narrative origin for guilt: *"It's a habit you learned in your childhood, probably far away where you can't even remember when you did something and you upset mommy or upset daddy, and now daddy's giving you a harsh word... And then you learn these behaviors through correct mistakes... to not be guilty of any wrongdoing."* This grounds the abstract feeling in a relatable developmental story.

**9. The Metaphor of Poverty vs. Wealth (for Buddhism vs. Dhamma)**
*   During the discussion on the distinction between "Buddhism" and "Dhamma," **Speaker C** uses an economic metaphor. He says people often see **"Buddhism [as] signifies poverty,"** a giving away of things. In contrast, **"the Dhamma is completely opposite. It kind of gives you everything."** This highlights the perceived difference between a renunciative religion and a fulfilling inner practice.

These metaphors and stories serve to make abstract psychological and meditative concepts more tangible, relatable, and easier to understand and apply.
