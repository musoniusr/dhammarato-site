### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So basically what you're saying then is, Ben, and by the way, good to see you again. Really happy to see you. And we started talking about it, and the frame that I use is the expression, sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that's exactly it. Exactly it. So yeah, as I was saying, sometimes I very skillfully apply Anapanasati. And, you know, I notice that my mind goes to a thought about having anxiety or something like that. And I'm immediately like, hey, I see what you're doing. I see what you're doing. And then boom, it's gone. And I crack on with whatever it is. That I was doing. But then other times it's 5, 10 minutes maybe before I realize that this unwholesome thought has been there, present, piecing me up a bit.

**Speaker A:** It slipped in.

**Speaker B:** It slipped in and it's doing what it does.

**Speaker A:** And you're not paying attention.

**Speaker B:** I wasn't paying attention. And then I'm like, wait a minute, what are you doing here? And it leaves. But it's kind of like the damage has been done a little bit.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. That when we have those unwholesome thoughts, you could say that every thought changes the body chemistry a little bit as if it were leaking something like adrenaline. So every unwholesome thought is another drop of adrenaline going right into the blood system until all of a sudden we feel fight or flight in the body. But we haven't had any fight-or-flight thoughts exactly. They weren't at that level, but it built up to that.

**Speaker B:** Okay, exactly.

**Speaker A:** And then, and at other times, you can in fact catch that stuff as it starts off and put a stop to it early. Okay, well, congratulations, you are figuring out that you're human. This is exactly what happens. Sometimes you feel like a nut, and sometimes you don't. Which means sometimes right effort is actually quite easy, and sometimes it takes a lot of effort.

**Speaker B:** It's in the name, effort, partly because

**Speaker A:** that drippy faucet or whatever has already now gotten so much of it in the bucket that it's a heavy, heavy lift. Where if you only got a couple of drops in it, then it's easy to pick it up and throw it out. This is exactly how the mind works. And when we realize that it works like that, that is what helps us to redouble our— looking for the right word. The word is enthusiasm. Let us build up our enthusiasm, which means we're going to be kind of alert to the fact that there are times a day when I am not sharp. Okay, there are times a day when it's really, really beautiful. I mean, to be honest with you, and this has been known for so many centuries, that taking a dump is really pleasant if you have it in meditation. I mean, just emptying things out and just letting it go. Oh, what a relief it is.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, it is. It can be a very beautiful experience for sure.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So allow those moments to be there. So, and you're now kind of on guard, enthusiastically on guard to find out what parts of the day make life really easy and what parts of the day do I give myself a hard time on. But in fact, we had begun to mention that in the sense of the evening time in our society, all the stores are closed, all the banks are closed, all the businesses are closed, and all the business that we think to be done at night, we can't do it because the stores are closed. So we're all dressed up mentally and no place to go. That leaves us with that anxiety.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and okay, and as you're trying, as it's evening time and there's less stimulation or distractions, I suppose it's also

**Speaker A:** a more dangerous time of day. That's when the predators are out.

**Speaker B:** Very true, very true.

**Speaker A:** They're dying out at the evening.

**Speaker B:** Sharks prowling the reef, lions prowling the savannah. You got exactly— you got big scary animals.

**Speaker A:** No, our own gorillas in the mind are out on prowl. Isn't that interesting? And so the evening time is a time to be careful.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes. And so it's, it's definitely a time of day where I find myself slipping for sure. Yeah, it did for, for a good few years now that I've been battling with this anxiety and whatnot. It's always been the nighttime, the evening time where I suppose problems have occurred and, you know, feelings have become more intense and whatnot.

**Speaker A:** There's another point that we can look at also which has some value, and that is, is that if we wake up in the morning and are up all day, then by the time the evening comes, the body and the mind are tired. And when the mind is tired That is the time when, let us say, the hindrances have the most opportunity. The Buddha refers to it— the translation at least is adventitious defilements, in the sense that the defilements only come when they have an advantage to do so.

**Speaker B:** Cowards. They don't fight on even They don't fight on even footing. They need the advantage. Come on, come at me like a man, mano a mano. Not when I'm tired. Come on.

**Speaker A:** I guess what the playing field is not level, but it's not always slanted in the same direction. It's kind of like the foundation of everything is a teeter-totter. Everything is in flux.

**Speaker B:** Everything.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. That's what things are like. So beginning to notice that in the mind also, the mind is sometimes up and sometimes down. Sometimes it's sharp, sometimes it's not. But always we're going to start watching. Well, when is the time of day, or what are the triggers? What are the buttons? When are they open? When are they exposed? What are the things that we're most sensitive to? Who do you identify with? And if somebody identifies you with that, even if it's only slightly that way— let us say that you were a professional football player, and then you're watching TV and one of the announcers is talking about, oh, football has got a scandal, and now we feel bad, we are football, you see.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so by our identifications, we actually pick up extra buttons to be pushed that we need not. So now that you've got this collection of buttons, whatever it is, start to become mindful of when your buttons get pushed. So that you might want to give some of those buttons away. Okay, like "I like Ike,"

**Speaker B:** you can

**Speaker A:** throw that one out. Political buttons and identifications like that, it's very interesting that if you identify with a political party, then when that political party has a good day, you have a good day. And when that political party has a bad day on account of it, you have a bad day. And guess what? For a big political party, especially on voting day, is always a mixed bag, which means you're almost always guaranteed that your life is at best a mixed bag.

**Speaker B:** At best.

**Speaker A:** At best a mixed bag. When I identify with things that are a mixed bag, when I— and tell me something that I can identify with that's not a mixed bag. And we can go for that. Something like a noble mind. But things like a religion or a political party or a particular nation is always a mixed bag.

**Speaker B:** Goodness, I do not identify with the UK. If the UK is having a bad day, I do not care. If the UK is having a good day, I do not care.

**Speaker A:** Not my business.

**Speaker B:** It's really not. It's really not. No, I do not care for the UK.

**Speaker A:** Okay, this is actually the teaching of the Buddha to not identify with that. In fact, one of the statements about it is to lower the banners. Okay, there's in fact 4 of them. I'll go ahead and give you all 4 because this is very interesting when you're talking about this. One of them is that we fill in the trench or we fill in the moat. In other words, our outer boundaries, our territorial boundaries, we no longer care about so much. Okay. The next one is that we put down the cross. In this case, we're talking about a sword with a hilt. Okay. We're putting down the crossbow. We're putting down the sword. We're putting down weapons. Okay, why? Because we feel safe. Yes, we're taking down the boundaries. Okay, uh, the next one is to take down the banners, the one that we just started mentioning first. Don't identify with anything. Basically, if that organization has an ID, a logo, a mascot, uh, an avatar it's to be avoided. If they've got a flag, if they've got a symbol of an elephant that's got red, white, and blue, or they've got a picture of a donkey as a symbol of— with the donkey that's red, white, and blue— that's a good guarantee. That symbol is enough to say that's at best a mixed bag

**Speaker B:** and something that you should definitely stay away from.

**Speaker A:** So stay away from political affiliations, stay away from countries because countries have flags. Anything that's got a banner, anything that's got a logo, any organization like Microsoft, and on your computer there they are, that window, the Microsoft window, right? Have you ever noticed how wonky-jawed and difficult it is to see through that window?

**Speaker B:** It's very true. It's very true. Bill Gates could have done a better job.

**Speaker A:** And so in that regard, even Microsoft with their logo, that makes it mixed bag. And so we're beginning to put down all the mixed bags, all the wins and loses. I mean, that's the whole point about having a banner. Is so that you know who won and who lost. Well, if you're out of the game, out of the business, and we don't care who won or lost, we can set down the banners. We don't care about them.

**Speaker B:** Don't care.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And then the last one of the four is to unbolt the door.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Uh, that we, we try to close things off, we try to keep the world out, we try to maintain safety. But if you already feel safe then you could feel safe with your door unlocked. That if death is coming, it's going to come through the door whether the door is locked or not.

**Speaker B:** It doesn't care if the door's bolted, it's just going to go straight through.

**Speaker A:** But in a way, we can think of this one as also opening the heart.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, if you keep it closed and you force it closed and you cause yourself a lot of unnecessary tension. So by letting it be open, then you release a lot of that tension.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. So the openness means already that you've gotten to your point where you are free from fear, that you feel secure enough to leave the door open at night.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** I think that's my problem, especially at nighttime. Because it's happened to me so many times at nighttime. When nighttime comes up, I'm like, bolt the door, draw your swords, let's go. What are we on lookout for? But then there's sod all to be on lookout for. There's nothing there. And I'm just left with a feeling of tension. I'm ready to, you know, mess something up, but there's nothing to mess up, and I'm just left feeling hyper-aware, vigilant, tense.

**Speaker A:** And congratulations, now you know that. Now that you know that, you could be on guard for it. You could say, 4 PM, oh, warfare in 2 hours. Oh, the gorillas are coming in an hour and a half, you know. And you can start to laugh at yourself about the fact that, you know, we get ourselves into these things. And there are clues throughout the day and other things. I found that one of my clues was driving. I could be absolutely beautiful, relaxed, get behind the wheel of the car, and the whole island better watch out. You better watch what's coming. But by being mindful of that, you can see through it, especially if I'm going to go pick up someone at the point, or I've got an appointment or something. That's when it really comes up, that anxiety. So these are the kinds of things that we can begin to look at. Is what are the triggers? What triggers the anxiety? You begin to get one of them is evening time for you.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Other people— this is in fact why these, uh, the psychologists are more— this is a psychiatric kind of thing— is dealing with phobias. And they give these things. Okay, going out. Going out and getting exposed is dangerous, which means that going out is pushing people's buttons. So being exposed in an open area where the birds or the bees can attack, that's a dangerous situation. And so people get that, right? Other people, because a dog jumped on them when they're a kid and now they hate dogs or they're afraid of dogs. And guess who's the dog going to bark at? The ones who are afraid of them.

**Speaker B:** Yep, they can smell it.

**Speaker A:** And so in that regard, we actually make the things that we're a danger. We create our own dangerous situations. We invite the danger to exist because we feel the danger and think about the danger out of old habits. Yeah, that you could have felt like you were in danger at some time in the evening. One of those things that happens to kids, the kids have got to go sleep in another room. The Thai kids actually, uh, even Piti right now at the age of 9 still sleeps in the same room with us and sometimes in the same bed, and sometimes she and mom are in the same bed and I'm in a bed by myself. But in the West, oh no, 2 different rooms. Kid, you go to your room. Mom and Dad have got business. Okay, and what does the kid think about then? Oh, dangerous business. Oh, and not only that, but they left a bear under my bed and there's a gorilla in the closet.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Mommy! Okay, well, if— but if the child is left in a secure place at night then they were unlikely to have that kind of fear. Also, in our society, unlike in the really old days, you see, in the old days we lived by nature, but now we have electric lights to keep us warm. We turn the lights on when we feel in danger, but in fact, people will turn the lights on when they hear a noise so that they can see what's going on, where in the old days we would listen very carefully to things that go bump in the night because we weren't so afraid, because we're out there in the night and things go bump all the time, and here we are and we're still alive. But Westerners with electricity, things go bump in the night and they, they go bump in the brain.

**Speaker B:** They go bump in the brain.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Because there's fears about the night, or there's fears about going out. And so fears of snakes and fears of spiders and all of that kind of stuff is literally learned behavior. An example of that is, uh, eagles are not afraid of rattlesnakes. When the eagle sees rattlesnake, he sees dinner.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** But a teenage kid out on the trail sees a rattlesnake and he gets petrified with fear.

**Speaker B:** It's a venomous snake. Oh no, it's going to kill me.

**Speaker A:** All his life about how dangerous they are.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so danger then, many of the things that are dangerous is actually learned behavior. Almost always it's learned secondarily in the sense that, oh, I know snakes are dangerous because I've been told they're dangerous. My whole life, and I'm at least smart enough now to not go test that out. By the way, this kind of thing exactly happened to me, and it happened in the case that one summer while I was in high school, I worked for the highway state department. And what we did was, we went out and gathered sand samples so that we could dig up the sand and use local sand rather than have to have it imported in. Ah, guess what?

**Speaker B:** Lots of snakes.

**Speaker A:** Thanks. Exactly. Lots of copperheads and water moccasins and rattlesnakes are in the swamps of South Carolina. This is in the Piti swamps of South Carolina, and we're in there looking for sand, and all we're finding are beaver dams loaded down with snakes.

**Speaker B:** That's pretty cool though, I've got to say.

**Speaker A:** The guys that I worked with were cool with that. They loved it. At one point, I remember standing on a dirt road while this guy runs off into the— off the road into the thing. And the next thing I know, I see this giant snake flying through the air onto the road with him immediately coming chasing it after and wants to stand. He's got a bush axe in his hand. He could have killed that snake at any time, but he didn't want to kill it. Because he didn't want to cut the skin because he wanted the belt. And this one was big enough for a nice belt with maybe a hat band left over.

**Speaker C:** Wow.

**Speaker A:** These are the guys that I was with, and that's how I learned about snakes, that there's no— you can pick up a live rattlesnake. You can just pick him up. You gotta hold him right.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** But you can do it. You can do it. You can do it very safely.

**Speaker A:** And so you know then that these things are safe. But the average person who has never had any experience with it, they freak out. So here you are having it, being in the habit of freaking out about the night when you have had, what, 10,000 nights so far that have not been freak-out worthy?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** When I run— I— that's, you know, you hit the nail on the head there. It is very much learned behavior from a handful of experiences weighed against literally— what am I, I'm 24— literally like 6,000 days, 6,000 nights of complete fine, great night's sleep, you know, no problems getting to sleep.

**Speaker A:** And yet the waking up, they're there. Those are still there. This, in fact, these buttons is what he finds now. And they understand post-traumatic stress disorder, or these buttons are left around. And things that freaked us out when we were in battle, or freaked us out when we were in the battle with a parent when we were 3 years old— and believe me, that's the for a 3-year-old is dealing with an adult, and we get traumatized. Yeah, which means we keep those old defenses when the defenses are not needed anymore. We keep these old tripwires out in the yard, and they get hit randomly. And so what the psychiatrist or psychologist will call these false positives that our fear mechanism, our, um, self-preservation instinct, has these set of buttons that are no longer useful. And when those buttons are touched, the self-preservation instinct starts talking. And normally what he has to say is, oh God, panic mode time. Yeah, when in fact there's nothing to be panicked over that's present in this moment, that what was to be panicked over was to be panicked over 20 years ago. Yeah, but the button is still there.

**Speaker B:** Button is still there.

**Speaker A:** Or the button should have been left in Afghanistan, but the soldier carried it with him.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Or he should have left it in Vietnam. But he took it with him because those buttons kept him alive in dangerous situations. They're useful.

**Speaker B:** Okay, they served a purpose.

**Speaker A:** Not anymore. That meant that they were valuable. Now we have to recognize that they have a danger. We don't want to destroy the button, but we want to make it work better. In the sense of not having so many positives, because our fear has kept us alive.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, if you didn't have fear, completely

**Speaker A:** fearless, we'd be walking off of mountains

**Speaker B:** and be walking out into the middle of roads. You'd be right.

**Speaker A:** So our fear has some wisdom to it.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** We have to refine that wisdom so that it is actual wisdom that, uh, that works with the fear rather than the old panic buttons.

**Speaker C:** Yes, yes, yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** And so now it's your turn to start locating these, to start recognizing the buttons themselves, rather than once the button is pushed, you have to— you start now to hear those ooga horns. Now you need to recognize what's the tripwire, what was it that stuff started.

**Speaker B:** I mean, I think for me it is an accumulation of thinking about past anxiety episodes and thinking about the possibility of being anxious later, which when I say out loud sounds so stupid, it really sounds so stupid. But it's a way of thinking that I've had for the past 3 or so years. So I understand it's not the sort of thing that I'm just going to kick in a few weeks. It's going to take work.

**Speaker A:** But, and it can be happy work because this is a toy we're playing with.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** This is, this is like, in a way you can see it like this, you know, the jack-in-the-box.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And it's got the little crank. Okay, guess what? You know when it's gonna pop. Yeah, start watching for it and listening to the music while you're handing the— while you're grinding the thing, so that when it does pop, you're not surprised.

**Speaker B:** You're not surprised.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** That you, you're learning this mechanism, you're getting a hold of this button or this tripwire, and you begin to see how it operates, and therefore you can become immune to its effects. You can see it coming, literally. You can see it coming, just like somebody shooting an arrow at you or throwing a spear, because spears are pretty slow. If you can see a spear coming at you, you got plenty of time to stand out of the way.

**Speaker B:** The only slow— pretty big, pretty obvious that one's flying towards you.

**Speaker A:** The obvious that they're coming towards you. And the power that it has is in its weight, not in its speed.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Unfortunately, thoughts are different than that. Their power is not in their weight, it's in their speed. And so this is why Sati, we need to be fast enough for it, is to stand out of the way of these fearful thoughts. Yeah, if we could stand out of the way of a spear.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** In fact, I figured that out with the kid. Okay. Uh, and what I— what it was is, is that it was, um, you know, one of these old movies about other deeper older civilizations, and the, uh, uh, the high priest was standing on the high ground and the, the little guys were standing out in the audience area, great below, and the priest grabs the spear from the guard, hoisted up, and throws it. And this idiot is standing there and letting the spear hit him in this movie, and I was saying, Scrooge, get out of the way!

**Speaker B:** You have several things that warn you there. He took the spear from the guard, he lifted his arm up to throw it, and then he threw it. You have 3 moments, 3 very obvious moments that you can see happening, and you just choose to stand there and just let it hit you. That's a good way to think about what a lot of people do in terms of, you know, like, unhelpful thoughts. In the mind. They stand there and they just let

**Speaker A:** themselves— yeah, by there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** that's fear. Instead of recognizing, hey man, I can stand out of the way of this. I do not have to punish myself because I've seen myself do something wrong. I can say, okay, there it is, never mind. But normally it's a Who's going to find out?

**Speaker B:** And then you play victim as well.

**Speaker A:** Precisely. Once we get hit, we're a victim. We're a victim of that. No, we're not a victim of that sphere that hit us. We're a victim of our stupidity of not getting out of the way of the sphere. But that's hard to see. Yeah, that part is more difficult to see. We would rather be a victim. In fact, we get great pleasure out of being the victim who got hit by that. Uh, because otherwise we would have to take responsibility for the fact that we got hit. And so here I am with that, uh, a spear sticking out of me or into me or whatever like that, and at least I can have the pleasure of saying he did it.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, he did it.

**Speaker B:** You don't take fault for it, you don't own up, you don't take responsibility. When I suppose a lot of people manufacture their own spears to be thrown at themselves. And then even though they've manufactured the spear to be thrown at themselves and they've let themselves get hit, they still play victim and find something else to blame it on.

**Speaker A:** Guess what? The spears that they've learned to make for themselves have directions. They've got blueprints. These spears look just like the spears that Mom and Dad threw at him when he was a kid.

**Speaker B:** Ah, yes, yes, they have very clear origins.

**Speaker A:** So we know what these spears look like. We've been throwing those same spears at ourselves all of this time.

**Speaker B:** It's a very good way to think about it. I know what my spears look like. Yeah, it's a very, very good way of wording things. Very good way.

**Speaker A:** So back in the 1970s, we called it buttons. So we've made some quite advances. We've turned them from buttons into spears. Wait a minute, we're going backwards on technology.

**Speaker B:** I think I prefer the spear analogy. It makes it seem a lot better because you can see the spear coming. You know, if you press a button, it's very instant. But I mean, you said the mind is much quicker than somebody throwing a spear though.

**Speaker A:** So we have to get used to looking at things very quickly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But in fact, it's generally a barrage. It's not just one thought or one sphere. It's right, one thought after another, after another.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So be alert to that. Be on guard for that, knowing that you at certain times of the day or in certain situations, that is going to be a tense situation. And right now you haven't gotten to the point of being able to get away from that. In fact, even if you became a monk and were staying in the back of the wat, By the way, at Wat Soan Mok, they do have power. They just cut it off at 9 or 10 in the evening.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay.

**Speaker A:** Because they've always cut it off. When they had a generator back in the 1980s, they were the only generator in town, but at least they had one for the evening time so that people could find their way back to their kutis in the dark. After that, they turned it out. Even nowadays, they turn the power out.

**Speaker B:** I think so.

**Speaker A:** Here you are. If you've got any phobias that have to do with night, that's a place to get over them or get out of there.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** But in any case, that's also a way of looking at it in the sense that now that you know what you're looking for, you can actually put yourself into those situations to check it out.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Am I really afraid? Okay, like the issue of the snakes, got to keep checking that out. Well, here I am on literally Koh Phangan. It actually means the island of forest snakes.

**Speaker C:** Oh, uh-huh.

**Speaker A:** And so this is a good place to check out that phobia. And when we find one, the whole family comes with great joy. Oh, Kitty, look at this one.

**Speaker B:** That's a very good way to do it.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So she's not afraid of snakes at all. We have plenty of snakes and nobody here is being afraid of them at all. We learn to be afraid of snakes by people who are afraid of snakes.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So whatever it is that you are afraid of, whatever triggers it, trigger that off. That's what needs to be looked at so that we can figure out what it is that we do that make ourselves afraid When we begin to let it, like I said in the beginning, sometimes we feel like a nut, sometimes we don't. What is it that helps us make that transition? What buttons are pushed? What spears do we get hit by? What is it that makes these transitions? And so we can begin to get a broader perspective of how the fact that we get ourselves into bad states

**Speaker B:** investigation.

**Speaker A:** All about investigation. So now you've got something new, a new way of investigating. What are those triggers? What are the things? One of the ways that we can talk about it is the idea of a don't-do list. And the example that we have is that the old man has been going to the temple for many, many years. He's a deacon or whatever the equivalent of that is, and that he's well known and well loved, and he spends a lot of time during the day at the wat. And then a new monk comes and he gets into an argument with this new monk. What does this old guy do, this old Anicca dude? He goes home and he puts the wat completely, including this new monk, out of his mind. He does not think about it, nothing. He just literally forgets all about it.

**Speaker B:** Forget about it.

**Speaker A:** Forget about it. And then next, next Wednesday or whatever Buddha day, he goes back to the wat and he assumes that the monk has also forgotten all about it. And here they are, good to go again. The one who remembers the past is the one who is instigating the argument for the present moment. So it's always better just to forget about it and assume that they have also, and everybody's just let that one go. Uh, the term for it in the, uh, in the Pali Canon, especially in the Vinaya, is covering over with leaves. Okay, so somebody— yeah, so somebody took a dump in the yard, the easy way to take care of it is just cover it over with leaves, and that's all we need to do. So covering it over with leaves and just leave it, don't forget about it. That's literally the whole thing to do, is just to forget about it. Okay, but we need to then put that on the list in the sense of this old, uh, deacon of the temple has actually put it on his list to actively forget about it. So any kind of thoughts that come up about the temple, he's going to say, not now, out you go. That you're dangerous. Having thoughts of the temple is dangerous. If he has a thought about the temple, he might have a thought about that monk. And if he has a thought about that monk, now he might have thoughts about weapons.

**Speaker B:** Oh God, oh God.

**Speaker A:** And, and so the whole idea is let's stay away from the dangers. Let's figure out that we can forget all about that stuff.

**Speaker B:** But the monk also recognizes the thought pattern, and he sees what emotions or feelings it will lead to. He knows that if he thinks about the temple, or think about the monk, and then he'll think about getting violent, and then he'll be angry, and he doesn't want to be angry. So he recognizes where the cascading thoughts will lead to. And so he stops it right at the source. That's a good way to look at it. I feel like at the moment, I don't know, there are further steps back that I can take for sure. Like I said, it's only been a few weeks. You know, maybe I'm being a bit too self-critical of myself and my skills.

**Speaker A:** Put that on your not-to-do list.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, forget about it.

**Speaker A:** Just forget about it. You're okay already. Stop criticizing yourself, you're okay already. There was one example of that, was when I had a friend who was here in Thailand and doing the meditations from England. And so one of the talks that we had was about no thoughts of England. The whole nation. Any thoughts while you're in Thailand, no thoughts of England, okay? No thoughts, no one, no place to go, no travel arrangements, no thoughts about going home, nothing. When you're here in Thailand, stay here in Thailand.

**Speaker B:** That sounds difficult.

**Speaker A:** Well, no, not if we're on guard, not if we are enthusiastic about, I'm going to catch that stuff.

**Speaker B:** Turn it into a game.

**Speaker A:** Into a game, precisely.

**Speaker B:** Turn it into a game, turn it into something.

**Speaker A:** So that when somebody makes the mistake, everybody howls with laughter, and it's not about keeping score, it's about being properly entertained in a loving, happily environment. So stop looking at things as if they were work to do. Or keeping score when we do something wrong, but much more if it's a game that we're playing. Yeah, every time I mess up, haha, caught you that time.

**Speaker B:** That game, that enthusiasm, that comical way of looking at things is definitely very helpful. Like when I catch myself going to somewhere thinking something unwholesome, I'll have like a different mental image of me disposing of the thought, sending it to oblivion, like me roundhouse kicking something off a cliff. I'm just like, bye! It's a very entertaining— and for me it works— a very entertaining and comical way of me disposing of whatever unwholesomeness there is.

**Speaker A:** Yes, play a game like that.

**Speaker B:** Sky or something like that. Yeah, or it just— click my fingers and it just goes and on.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so this is something now to be, uh, on guard for kind of all day long, is start to look at these swings, these mood swings that we have, and figuring out what is it that triggers them. And you've already identified one of them. There's probably a half a dozen or more that you can identify, but we've got one of them, and it is when it gets nighttime. Yeah, that thing.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** I remember one time, this was many years ago, I was in the U.S. as a monk, and we got into a conversation like that, and I admitted Only my mommy knows where my buttons are. You don't know where my buttons are, so you cannot tick me off. Only my mommy knows where my buttons are.

**Speaker B:** That's very true.

**Speaker C:** Yeah,

**Speaker B:** you can't.

**Speaker A:** As it turns out, that's not even true anymore. Mommy cannot touch me.

**Speaker B:** Oh.

**Speaker A:** That button was pretty well disposed of. So that's the way to think about it, right? Through practice, out it goes.

**Speaker B:** Through practice, yeah, yeah. I do need to remind myself that it is early days, you know.

**Speaker A:** And yeah, you've got tons and tons of years left to enjoy the hell out of every moment. Yes, starting now.

**Speaker B:** Starting now. And the next moment. And the next moment. And the next moment.

**Speaker A:** Until one of those spears get thrown at us that we don't see it coming. And then— Anagami got me. So the thing to do then is out you go. Never mind. Start again. We're good to go.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, having that enthusiasm and that comicalness definitely helps. Makes everything seem a hell of a lot less serious. When you take things too seriously, then it becomes— I have heard it becomes a drag, it becomes a bore, it becomes a chore. It's not something that you should view as a chore, it's something that you should view as good and fun and whatnot.

**Speaker A:** Many examples of that that we have. One of them is in the book Tom Sawyer, written by Clemens, also known as Mark Twain. And in this book, Tom Sawyer's aunt wants him to paint the fence. So he goes out and paints. While he's painting the fence, Huckleberry Finn walks by, and Tom Sawyer begins to have a ball painting the fence. He really enjoys painting the fence, and they get into conversation to the point that then Huckleberry Finn is asking, can he paint too? And Tom is saying, no, you got to know what you're doing here. This is for the big guys. Oh, please let me paint. Okay, here's the brush. And now Tom gets go sit under a tree while Huckleberry Finn does the painting. And Huckleberry Finn loves it because that's the attitude that was presented to him. So it's not about painting the fence at all, it's about how do we spend our moments. Are we going to paint our fences with great joy? Are we going to paint our fences with drudgery?

**Speaker B:** I'd like to paint my fences with joy.

**Speaker A:** Right. All you have to do is to remember that every time the paint can comes out. In a metaphorical way, you can say that the paint can, that's the trigger, or that's the, um, uh, uh, the button. So whatever your paint cans are Note them well. Yeah, the buttons are— that's going to push you into feeling bad. Start to notice those. Yeah, be on guard for them.

**Speaker B:** Make note of the buttons. See the buttons.

**Speaker A:** One of those buttons, by the way, is emails. Yeah, yeah, that's a kind of a funny one. But even emails, that's a button. Some emails, easy, just delete it. You don't even care, uh, to read it, or you don't even care to read the title because you know who it's from, and out it goes. Others, you read the title. Others, now we feel so much about whether one way or the other, now we've got to respond to it.

**Speaker B:** You respond to it right away as well. You've got to do it now.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's what we tell ourselves. This is important. Guess what?

**Speaker B:** It's not important.

**Speaker A:** Probably not. You can wait 10 minutes. If this mail has freaked me out to the point that I'm feeling bad, why should I answer it when I'm feeling bad? Let me go do something happy and get myself happy, and now I'll come back and rip through that email happily.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So that's another one to look for, is emails. How am I going to handle— can I handle all of the emails joyfully?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, answering an email is an autopilot sort of thing. You get yourself worked up into certain emotions, and then as you reply, you put those emotions into the reply. It's autopilot. Whatever you're feeling, you just— you don't give it any thought.

**Speaker A:** That's why we do so many mindful, mindless things, is because we're not paying attention. This is the time to wakey wakey. This is the dangerous point. Email. So we've got several of them identified. It gets night, we get tired, it gets dark, we get afraid. That's the time to wake up. Yeah, another one is emails coming. Yeah, incoming emails. For me and others, driving or transportation. Mhm. That some people, they really love to ride the bus. Other people are freaked out about riding the bus. Why is that? Because we got into use to freaking out about riding buses, and so every time you get on a bus, we freak out. That's what we're supposed to do. It's about already, don't you know? You're supposed to freak out when you're on buses. Airplanes, that's another one where people will freak out.

**Speaker C:** Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Airplanes, airplanes for me as well.

**Speaker A:** Another one would just be airports themselves. If there is ever a place of human massive freak out.

**Speaker C:** It is airport.

**Speaker A:** People are absolutely freaked out, the whole crowd of them. Why? Because they're going someplace they don't know. Very few, uh, seasoned passengers. Most passengers are infrequent flyers, and so they don't like what's happening at airports. They don't like the fact that they're not the only one in the airport. I mean, they built that airport for me. I'm the Anagami star here. Why do I have to deal with all of these other people? And TSA, who are you? And so everybody's just all freaked out. So that's another one. Transportation, especially airports, going to business. Many people freak out about taking tests. Others freak out about going to interviews. Everybody has a whole group of things that we freak out on. And it's really good to become aware of those things so that we can see them like the spear and see it in advance and step out of the way so that I don't have to feel bad at all. I can take a knee, I can take an interview just like we're sitting here. Why should I have to be uptight and freaked out because I'm in an interview? Ah, because the interview is important. If you don't make a good impression— yeah, but if you are freaked out, what kind of impression are you making?

**Speaker B:** You're going to be really tense, you're going to appear kind of robotic, you know, you're not going to make a good impression for your interview if you, if you're acting like that.

**Speaker A:** Precisely. And so this is why we need all of these various occasions to really figure out where are my buttons, so that we can plan in advance to unhinge those things or disconnect that button or whatever metaphors that we want. So that we're not affected by those things, that we can dodge them, and we do so as part of the game that we're playing, because this is all joyful.

**Speaker B:** Yes, games are meant to be fun, games are meant to be happy and joyful experiences.

**Speaker A:** Entertaining.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** So if you— they don't let kids

**Speaker A:** do that anymore in school, they want them to sit there and learn their ABCs instead.

**Speaker B:** But no, if you make the process of working with the mind a fun, entertaining experience, then you're more likely to succeed at it. Too many things have been too boring and stuff and not joyful. You know, people don't want to try their best at that sort of stuff. You make the experience fun and entertaining, then you're more likely to try harder because it's fun, because you want to have more fun. So you're going to see more success.

**Speaker A:** Well, you've already now started with that success. You know that it's fun. And then you say, but I run into these brick walls.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And now we're beginning to look at how can we avoid that so that we can have fun throughout the evening?

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Or have fun riding the bus or have fun walking through the airport or having fun standing in TSA's line so that they can take my shoes away.

**Speaker B:** So that they can touch you up.

**Speaker C:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** but nobody does any of that stuff joyfully. They all hate it, and they hate each other for hating it too.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you see somebody from TSA and you're like— you see them and you just instantly associate them with what's to come, and so you immediately have a disdain for them.

**Speaker A:** And they see that, they see you coming, and how are they going to deal with you? They're going to rough you up just like you're roughing you up and roughing them up inside your mind, only they're going to do it with their wand.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So this is how we, we actually do create our own reality. And everyone around us is a willing player to make sure that our reality is as real as we want it to appear. And so if you think TSA agents are bad news, you can prove it to yourself. They will be.

**Speaker B:** Yes, almost like a self-fulfilling prophecy.

**Speaker A:** Precisely, this is the self-fulfilling prophecy, is we get ourselves into a mood. Like we said once before about the dogs, the person who is afraid of dogs is the one who is going to invite the dogs to bark at him.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** You invite— for my case, you know, it becomes nighttime, I suppose, and then I invite the unhelpful, the unpleasant, the unwholesome thoughts about feelings.

**Speaker A:** Precisely.

**Speaker B:** It becomes nighttime and I immediately invite them in. I'm just like, it's nighttime, guess it's time to start having those thoughts.

**Speaker A:** So be on guard.

**Speaker B:** Be on guard and don't invite them in. Close the door.

**Speaker A:** Close the door, exactly.

**Speaker B:** Close the door. You can't come in here.

**Speaker A:** I'm having fun in here. This is the party we're having. Folks.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yes, this is the way to practice that, so that we can begin to see these mood swings that we go through, to recognize that, yeah, we can do really well for a while, and then something will kick it off, something that is an old trigger for us that we don't even know about it. But every time that situation occurs we go wham, right into bad feelings.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** That can happen, in fact, with,

**Speaker B:** uh,

**Speaker A:** oh, trying to set up a situation where the girlfriend now has competition, but the competition always wears the same outfit outfit, says that she's working as a uniformed somebody, she works for a particular airline. Okay. So now that she's been identified with both the airline and identified with the competition for boyfriend, that means that now this girl has in her mind every time she sees anybody that works for that airline, they're somehow lower class. She's got an issue with them. It's by association, guilt by association, that we associate things like that. The mind unfortunately works that way. That's how we try to make understanding, and we make a lot of false connections. So many, a lot of false connections. So become aware then that we— some of these connections that we're making, because many of them might be false. Everything is worthy of a new investigation. Yeah, anything that we assumed may not be true anymore, time to investigate again. But if it investigates over and over and over again and we keep seeing the same things happening over and over again, we can take confidence in that. Yeah, but we don't stop investigating it, we keep investigating it. How's my joy? Good enough. How's my joy? Good enough. How's my joy? Good enough. It's good enough. Okay, it's good. All right, I got you. By the way, how's your joy?

**Speaker B:** Joy's pretty good. It's good.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, have to keep checking.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** See the triggers, identify the buttons. Check in on your joy, investigate, have fun doing so. That's what we've been doing. So, you know, and I'll keep applying Anapanasati. It is a skill, a skill that must be, you know, built upon. And I don't view it as a chore. I don't. I enjoy the process.

**Speaker A:** Marvelous to be alive, having a ball.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes it is.

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** So go have a ball.

**Speaker B:** I will indeed. Thank you very much for today.

**Speaker A:** I really enjoyed our conversation.

**Speaker B:** As did I. As did I. It was very good. The analogies that you used, they're very good ways of looking at it. I found it very, very helpful. Hopeful, and I'm gonna go off, investigate, and have fun doing so. That's the important bit. Thank you very much for today, Dhammarato. I enjoyed today very much, and I will speak to you again soon.

**Speaker A:** See you.

**Speaker B:** Okay, take care. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends (Speakers B and C), is a practical and encouraging discussion on mindfulness, anxiety, and how to skillfully work with the mind in daily life. Here is a summary of the key themes and advice:

### **Core Theme: "Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't."**
The talk acknowledges the natural fluctuation in mindfulness practice. Some moments, it's easy to catch unwholesome thoughts (like anxiety) immediately; other times, they slip in unnoticed and accumulate, affecting your mood and body chemistry.

### **Key Insights and Practical Advice:**

1.  **Understand the Mechanism of Anxiety:**
    * Unwholesome thoughts, even subtle ones, release stress chemicals (like adrenaline) into the body. Catching them early prevents a buildup that leads to full-blown anxiety or "fight-or-flight" feelings.
    * The mind's sharpness varies throughout the day. Times of fatigue (like evening) or low stimulation are when "adventitious defilements" or hindrances most easily arise.

2.  **Identify Your Personal Triggers & "Buttons":**
    * The evening is identified as a common trigger time—a period with less distraction where old mental patterns ("gorillas in the mind") emerge.
    * Other universal triggers include: emails, driving/transportation, airports, interviews, and specific phobias (e.g., snakes, dogs).
    * **Investigation is key:** Your task is to playfully and enthusiastically identify your unique triggers—the situations, times of day, or thought patterns that precede anxiety.

3.  **The Analogy of Buttons and Spears:**
    * We all have emotional "buttons" installed from past experiences (childhood, trauma, learned behaviors). When pushed, they trigger automatic fear/anxiety.
    * Dhammarato reframes these as **spears you can see coming**. With mindfulness (*sati*), you can learn to recognize the "spear" of a negative thought pattern early and "step out of the way" instead of letting it hit you and playing the victim.

4.  **Dis-identify to Find Peace:**
    * A major source of suffering is **identification** with mixed-bag groups: political parties, nations, sports teams, companies. Their wins and losses become yours.
    * The Buddha's advice is to **"lower the banners"**: put down these identifications, along with weapons (defensiveness), boundaries (the "moat"), and to "unbolt the door" (open the heart). This leads to true safety and lack of fear.

5.  **Make Practice a Joyful Game:**
    * The work of mindfulness should not be a dreary chore. **Turn it into a fun, investigative game.**
    * Examples: Laugh when you catch a thought; visualize roundhouse-kicking a negative thought off a cliff; approach triggers with curiosity rather than dread.
    * This builds **enthusiasm**, making you more likely to practice consistently and successfully.

6.  **Use Specific Techniques:**
    * **Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing):** Use this as your foundational skill to anchor awareness.
    * **The "Don't-Do" List:** Actively choose to forget about or "cover with leaves" unproductive thought cycles. If thinking about a topic always leads to anger or anxiety, train yourself to drop it immediately.
    * **Check-in Question:** Constantly ask yourself, **"How's my joy?"** Use this as a barometer for your mental state.

### **Conclusion & Encouragement:**
The talk ends with an emphasis on self-compassion and patience. It's early days in a lifelong practice. The goal is not perfection but joyful investigation. By learning to see your triggers (spears/buttons), dis-identifying from unnecessary mental baggage, and approaching the process with a playful heart, you can create a happier, more peaceful mind "starting now, and the next moment, and the next moment."

**In essence:** This talk is a guide to moving from being a victim of your automatic thoughts to becoming a joyful investigator and master of your own mind.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this rich dialogue, the speakers use a wide array of **metaphors and stories** to illustrate the nature of the mind, unwholesome thoughts, and the practice of mindfulness. Here is a breakdown:

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **"Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't."**
    *   **Meaning:** The foundational metaphor for the talk. It acknowledges that mental states and the ability to apply mindfulness (right effort) are naturally variable—sometimes easy, sometimes difficult. It normalizes the fluctuation.

2.  **The Dripping Faucet & Heavy Bucket**
    *   **Meaning:** Unwholesome thoughts are like drops of adrenaline (or poison) leaking into a bucket (the body/mind). If you catch it early (a few drops), it's easy to discard. If you don't, the bucket becomes heavy and hard to lift, leading to a full fight-or-flight response.

3.  **Buttons & Tripwires**
    *   **Meaning:** Triggers for anxiety or unwholesome states are like psychological "buttons" that get pushed or "tripwires" that get hit. These are often old, learned reactions (from childhood, trauma, etc.) that are no longer useful but still active, causing "false positives" of danger.

4.  **Spears (and Arrows)**
    *   **Meaning:** Harmful thoughts or external triggers are like spears being thrown at you. Their power is in their speed (not weight). With mindfulness (*sati*), you can learn to see them coming and "step out of the way" instead of standing there and being a victim. The talk extends this to say we often **manufacture our own spears** based on blueprints from our past (e.g., parents).

5.  **Predators & Gorillas in the Mind at Night**
    *   **Meaning:** The evening is metaphorically a time when "predators are out" and "our own gorillas in the mind are on the prowl." This connects to evolutionary psychology—night was a dangerous time—and explains why anxiety often spikes then, as our inherited and learned defenses activate.

6.  **The Teeter-Totter (Seesaw) & Unlevel Playing Field**
    *   **Meaning:** The mind's state is always in flux, like a teeter-totter. Hindrances and defilements are "cowards" that attack when the playing field is slanted in their favor (e.g., when we are tired).

7.  **Banners, Flags, and Logos (The "Four Lowerings")**
    *   **Meaning:** A story/teaching from the Buddha about dis-identification. To find peace, we should:
        *   **Fill in the moat:** Let go of rigid personal boundaries.
        *   **Lay down the sword:** Feel safe enough to not need psychological weapons.
        *   **Lower the banners:** Stop identifying with groups, nations, political parties, or companies (anything with a flag/logo). These are "mixed bags" and tie your happiness to their wins and losses.
        *   **Unbolt the door:** Open the heart, release tension, and live without fear, feeling secure.

8.  **Jack-in-the-Box**
    *   **Meaning:** Anxiety triggers are like a jack-in-the-box. If you pay attention to the music (the early signs), you know when it will pop and won't be surprised. You can learn the mechanism.

9.  **Painting the Fence (Tom Sawyer)**
    *   **Meaning:** A story from Mark Twain used to illustrate that **attitude is everything**. Practice can be a drudgery or a joyful game. If you approach it like Tom Sawyer—with fun and enthusiasm—you (and others) will be drawn to it and succeed.

10. **Covering Over with Leaves**
    *   **Meaning:** A story about an old temple deacon who, after an argument with a monk, simply chooses to "forget about it" and "cover it with leaves." This is a method of dealing with conflict: actively choosing not to dwell on or reignite past grievances.

11. **Learned Fear (Snakes, Dogs, Airports)**
    *   **Multiple Stories:** The speaker uses personal anecdotes and general observations to show that many fears are learned, not innate.
        *   **Snakes:** His story working in South Carolina swamps with colleagues who saw snakes as opportunities (for belts) versus most people who are taught to panic.
        *   **Dogs:** A person afraid of dogs invites dogs to bark at them; the fear is sensed.
        *   **Airports/TSA:** These are modern "freak out" zones where people's anxiety creates a self-fulfilling prophecy of unpleasant interactions.

### **Themes These Metaphors Support**

*   **Mind as a Process:** The mind is not static; it's a fluid process of triggers, reactions, and habits.
*   **Investigation & Play:** The path is not grim duty but a joyful investigation and game of catching the mind's tricks.
*   **Dis-identification:** Happiness comes from not tying your inner state to external, mixed-bag identities.
*   **Building Awareness:** The goal is to map your personal "buttons" and "spears" to see them coming and disarm them.
*   **Self-Fulfilling Prophecy:** Our fearful expectations often create the very reality we fear (e.g., with dogs, TSA agents, nighttime anxiety).

In summary, the talk uses a tapestry of vivid, everyday metaphors and relatable stories to demystify mental processes, reduce self-judgment, and frame the practice of mindfulness as an engaging, playful, and investigative art of living joyfully.
