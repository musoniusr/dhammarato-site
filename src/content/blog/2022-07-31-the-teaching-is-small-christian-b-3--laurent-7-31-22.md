### Transcript


**Speaker A:** And I'll pick this up. So guys, we're turning the video recorder on a little bit late. We've already been talking about the twin ideas of the teachings of the Buddha is both being small in the sense that there's not that much to it I know that a lot of people talk about it in the sense, well, you've got 16 of those and 12 of those and 8 of those and 4 of those and 5 of those and 4 more of these other things and 3 of that stuff. And it looks really, really complicated. But the reality is, is that almost all of that is various ways of looking at the teaching. An example is, is that the Eightfold Noble Path which is actually what we're doing when it— when the skills that the Eightfold Noble Method develop, when those skills are developed, now those skills become enlightenment factors, the sambojana. But it's the same thing. And then we have the balancing of the five faculties. But these faculties are nothing but the items, five of the items on the Eightfold Noble Path. Except that it's in a slightly different language. An example here is that in the Eightfold Noble Path, the words Samma Sanghappa is used, but in the Five Faculties, Shraddha, or confidence, is used. Different language. But you see, in the time of the Buddha, the people knew these things and they knew how the language works. But when it's translated out of the ancient language into modern English, Many of the connections are not easily seen. And so putting those connections back there together and then you say, oh, well, the five faculties are nothing but the seven factors of enlightenment that have to be balanced in order for them to become the skills which are the Eightfold Noble Path. Okay. So when we put it together like that, another way of looking at it is imagine that the teachings of the Buddha is like a giant jigsaw puzzle. And that it comes delivered in a box that has a picture of this puzzle on, so that you can see the puzzle, see what it looks like, and then put all the pieces together. The problem with the teachings of the Buddha when they came West, it came without the box. Without the box, you've got no clue about what the actual image is supposed to look like, and not only that, but a few pieces are missing. But when we get it all together, we can recognize, oh well, it's just one, one thing. It's just this jigsaw puzzle. It should be cut up into 500 pieces, but we can put those pieces back together and see how simple it is. So the next point is, is that not only is it just a simple thing, but it's also a one-size-fits- All, everyone can benefit from the teachings of the Buddha. And yet in psychology and psychiatry, they have the diagnostic codes, a whole big thick book of descriptions. It would almost be like it this way: the legal system, state laws or federal laws or the local laws or whatever like that, is trying to guide behavior. None of those systems need anything more than just one or two laws. The reason why they are complex the way that they are is because each law is written according to a particular behavior. That's the outcome of— it goes like this: the mind has the thought generating the feeling, And when the feeling gets strong enough, we'll act on it. And often this happens without us even knowing about it. This cycle of thought, feeling, action, thought, feeling, action happens over and over and over again. And when we begin to see it and pick up on it, we can say, oh, if I change the thought, I'll have a better feeling. And if I feel better, I won't have to do it. I won't have to do the action, like go get what I want. And if I want something and I really want it badly, I'll do anything to get it, including hurting people, killing somebody, stealing, lying about it, whatever like that. But if the mind is noble, then the morality can be very easy. We don't need all of those laws. We only need one. And what is the rule that we need? The one law we need is Dukkha. Dukkha, Nirodha. That's how simple the teachings of the Buddha are. If you see that you are dissatisfied, then come out of that dissatisfaction into satisfaction. And we practice that over and over and over again because our default is being dissatisfied. We were born dissatisfied. The first breath that a baby, newborn baby takes, the first breath he takes is to let out a yell. I remember mine. There I was in this enormous hot tub, swirling water, heated water, bubbling everything. And all of a sudden, the earthquake happened. The bottom dropped out. And the next thing I know, Dr. Young has had me by the heels, beating my ass. Well, I let out such a yell that I didn't stop yelling until I was about 35 years old. We all just start yelling and we don't shut up. Why? Because we're dissatisfied from very birth. That in fact, when we're a newborn, we need to have a lot of nurturing, that a baby will bond. You'll see, in fact, in many quarters they call it imprinting. But I'm using the word bonding. And if the mother bonds with the child and the child bonds with the mom, then the child's survival is highly likely. But if the mother does not bind, bond with her child, or the child does not bond with the mother, then the likelihood of that child dying is very high. And so the baby needs to be bonded with in order for it to survive. But by the time we're 4, 5, or 6 years old, the tables are turned. Mom is withdrawing her unconditional love, her nourishing, and puts you to work. Put you to school, do your homework, clean up your room, take out the trash, do what you're told to do. And so it all becomes kind of critical then. And so the teachings of the Buddha is let's find a way in our mind to go back to that nurturing that we had when we were infants, where there was nothing demanded of us and we were already okay. And that when we're very little as a child, 1, 2, and 3 years old, we like to play with everything. So let us get back to being that, where we feel nourished, we feel comfortable and happy, and everything is a toy to play with. Except that now we're doing it with the knowledge and the wisdom of an adult, but we're having the feelings of a child, and we're having the nourishment of a mom rather than the criticism. But most of us are overly criticized from early childhood, and we grow up with that set of rules, that set of criticisms, and we go around criticizing ourselves for the rest of our lives, saying that I didn't do good enough and I'm not good enough and I'm not good enough here and I'm not good enough there. And then we begin to compete with others saying, well, if I'm better than him, then that's good enough. And so we wind up competing, rather than regaining that feeling of at home, that feeling of nourishment, that feeling of everything is OK, and that there is no criticism, that we can stop the criticism. And everyone can benefit from that, whether they have the diagnostic label of schizophrenic, or neurosis, or psychosis, or whatever medicines they're everyone goes through that cycle of having unwholesome thoughts, followed by unwholesome feelings, followed by unwholesome actions. That the mind is the forerunner. In the time of the Buddha, by the way, they had it backwards in that the Brahmins looked at it like this: that if you do an action, that's like carving it in wood. Or writing it in stone, or writing it on a piece of paper. But your verbiage, your language, is like writing it in the sand, and it won't last long. But if you carve it into stone, your behaviors, they last a long time. And then your thoughts are like writing it in water or writing it in the air, that by the time your finger has moved, so has the writing that you're putting down has disappeared. It doesn't stay right. And so in that regard, and I've seen many people, in fact, the guy's name is Penn in the group of Penn and Teller, and Penn has talked about this. In fact, the laws have to do with your behavior and that your thoughts are private. So I can think about robbing the bank, but until the cops can gain evidence of it, then it's okay to have the thoughts to rob the bank, even if I have the thoughts to take me to the hardware store and buy the hardware to make the bomb to help me break in. Right.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** But the act of actually breaking into the bank is the rule, that's the law. And that the mind being the forerunner is not the issue, because it's the actual actions that matter in our society. That's why we've got such a messed up society, is because the Buddha says is that the mind is the forerunner. If you don't think it, you're not going to feel it. And if you don't feel it, you're not going to behave according to it. And yet we're out there behaving all the time without even knowing why we're behaving the way that we are. But when we start looking at our behavior, then we can recognize how we were feeling. This is why I give some students the example of, in your practice— in fact, both of you can start to practice this, maybe you've already— and that is use your chair as the anchor. Use the posture where you are as a motivation device for helping you to wake up. And here's how we use that. When you are sitting in a chair, when you get up, we almost always get up to go someplace. So we move from the posture of sitting to walking. What I recommend is for you to put the intermediate posture of standing in there intentionally for a moment, for a reason. And that is, is that when you remember that you're going someplace, that you stand up and then you stay standing and ask yourself, why did I get out of my chair? There I was, all fat and happy and everything was on, and all of a sudden something happened that was so strong that it made me get up. And so we can say, well, it was because I wanted coffee, or I wanted to go to the bathroom, or I wanted to go beat that child, or I wanted to go shut them up, or something like that. But at least we now know why we're doing what we're doing. We're reflecting upon it. And so after we reflect a couple of seconds, then we can proceed on to go do what we were going to do. Now, students, when they talk about this later, they say, you know, Many times I was already taking 10 steps before I remembered to do this. And so the answer to that is, well, when you do remember it, stop then and reflect. Why did I get out of my chair? And what was so important that I forgot all about watching what I was doing in order to get it? Because here I have taken 10 steps towards what I wanted without even waking up. To the fact that I got out of my chair. This is enormously valuable for students to start using these anchors to help us wake up, to come back into this present moment.

**Speaker B:** Because that's where we live.

**Speaker A:** Right here, right now. And that will give us an opportunity to say, hey, you know something, I can just sit back down. I don't really need to get up. I was okay before. Or I can go get it. And then when I come back, sit down. That's another opportunity to practice. When we sit down, we normally sit down to make the body at ease. We sit down for comfort that we don't like to stand up all the time. And so we sit down to take a load off. So we can say, well, this is an opportunity to practice taking not only just the load off of the body, the load off my feet, but take a load off my mind too. This is an excellent point in time every time I sit down to take a deep breath and relax and say, wow, I'm glad I remembered that I could sit down and fully sit down with no place to go and nothing to do. I can just take a moment and relax. And so these are the kind of things that we can do throughout the day to help us remember to be in the present moment, because that's what the real teachings of the Buddha is all about—to come out of the past, out of the old habits, out of the old behaviors that we were in, and look at what we're doing right now. That's all there is to it. It's an easy process and it's a one-size-fits-all. Everybody can benefit from this, get enormous benefit. The Buddha talks about it in the Anapanasati Sutta, is the practice of great fruit, enormous fruit, great benefit to start watching our breathing, to watching what the thoughts are, to watch how we feel, and not just to watch, but to take the right effort to change. The easiest thing to change is one's mind, to change the thoughts. An example of that is, think of the color red. You know what red looks like. Everybody knows the color red. You probably got a Santa Claus kind of shade of red. And now think of the color green and recognize that you just did that. You just changed your mind from red to green. All you have to do now is to remember that you can look at it and recognize you got the red in there. Let's change it to green. That's so much, so much easier when we recognize that, yeah, everybody can change their mind. You can change it from red to green anytime you want to, every time you can remember to do it. And so the next one is to be able to change the body, to intentionally let the body relax. And how we do that is by first of all, watching the breathing, not by just merely watching and letting it do whatever it was doing, but actually take control with one's right effort to actually control the breathing, to intentionally take a long, deep in-breath and get the benefit of that, and then intentionally let it out in a sigh in a relaxed, in a relief kind of way, and then take another deep in-breath, allowing the body to become safe, secure, comfortable. And when the mind is safe, secure, and comfortable, and the body is safe, secure, and comfortable, then that can bring on a state of satisfaction. The satisfaction added now is the Sukkha. Which is exactly opposite of the Dukkha, being dissatisfied. And so practicing with the breathing and with the mind, we now are using those two things to start to control the way we feel. If the body is okay and feeling safe and secure and relaxed, then we can begin to feel it. And so we use the mind to train the body, and then the skills that we have there we use now to train to feel the way that we want to feel? This is a good question. If you could feel the way you wanted to feel, how would you feel? Would you feel the way that you were feeling now because you've already decided you want to feel like this? How do you want to feel? You can feel any way you want to feel. And yet we're in the habit of feeling in the way that we were trained to feel. We feel the way that we were feeling when we were children. We got into habit of feeling in a certain way, and we continued to.

**Speaker B:** Feel that same way without investigating it.

**Speaker A:** But once we begin to investigate the way we feel, we recognize we got control over the way we feel too, even though our language is built otherwise. You've heard in our language, I feel, or I am frustrated, I am angry. No, you're not angry, but there is the feeling of anger that is there. But you're not the anger. So we begin to draw out and recognize, oh, I see the anger, but I'm not angry. I can see the frustration. I can see the anxiety, but I'm the one who sees it. I'm not the one who is it. And so we step out of it. And begin to see these cycles that we're caught in, these thought— these cycles of thought, feel, thought, feel, thought, feel, until it builds up. Thought, feel, and then outburst of behavior. If we can see these thought, feel, thought, feel cycles that we're in, we.

**Speaker B:** Can say, oh well, I can put.

**Speaker A:** A stop to that. And so the teaching of the Buddha is both simple and it's a one-size-fits-all system. Anapanasati works for everybody, and yet there are 40 different meditations, so they say. But according to Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and quite a lot of Pali research, the Buddha only taught one kind of meditation, and that is this Anapanasati that operates the way that we're talking about— the thoughts, the feelings, our attitude, the body's feelings, the Satipatthana. And so all we have to do is remember. That's all we have to do, remember, because the rest of it is actually fairly easy to do. That in fact, when we get on the roll— for many people, the right effort is difficult because they haven't ever done it before. And not only that, but they don't even think that they can do it. They will say something like, well, I did get rid of that thought, but it just came back, and I got rid of it again, and it just came back. Oh, poor me, I can't get rid of it. And the answer to that is, you just told me you got rid of it twice. You just showed me that you had success twice, but now you're still feeling like a victim. All you need to do is a third time, and then a fourth, and.

**Speaker B:** Then a fifth, and then a 90th.

**Speaker A:** And then a 5,000th. And by the time you can do it 5,000 times, you're getting pretty good at it. And so the effort becomes quite easy. But if we don't remember to take the right effort then we're stuck. But it doesn't matter what skill you have. If you don't remember to apply that skill, the skill is not going to do you any good. All right, your mic has gotten kind of noisy.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, just closing your window.

**Speaker B:** Sorry. No problem.

**Speaker A:** We saw it and we knew what to do about it and we fixed it. That's Anapanasati right there. All we had to do is just close the window. So Christian, do you have any comments or any questions about what we've been talking about?

**Speaker D:** Uh, no. No questions really. Maybe just a comment about, you know, before I used to think this process of liberation as, you know, meditate a lot, sit as much as you can, and one day you'll have a big moment of awakening sort of idea. But it's obvious to me now that it's really a moment-to-moment practice.

**Speaker A:** Wake up right now. Why wait for 10 years? Why put in all the work of meditation and not waking up and then expect something to happen? And you do wake up. Normally, people, when they get into the habit of practicing wrongly and don't wake up, they just keep doing that and on and on. I've actually seen people on Reddit that says, I've been meditating 50 years. How dare you come in and say that I can do it immediately because I've been doing it for 50 years and can't get it done and I'm still miserable. Right, that's the attitude that people have when they are practicing incorrectly, thinking that it's going to be out there in the future, when in fact everything is just right now. Even out in that future, when you get there, guess what? It'll be a now. Now he finally wakes up. Now he finally decides he can feel good. I mean, what's it going to take? What was your idea? I mean, I think most people have the idea that maybe the Kamma machine is going to waltz into the room with Shaktipat and do some Anagami, Anapanasati meditation, kind of lip music or chanting or whatever, splash some water on you, and all of a sudden you feel good because something else did it to you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Right now you recognize that no, you do it to you because it's your choice. Why wait?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, I think this body and mind is the path itself, the form.

**Speaker B:** That has to wake up.

**Speaker A:** So This is the basic practice, back to the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path, that that's all the Buddha teaches. That in fact, the very complicated topic that Laurent and I have spent some time on, called Paticcasamuppada, or Paticcasammapadai in Thai, and also known as dependent origination in English. That's actually nothing but a discussion of the Second Noble Truth. And you can see that it leaves all of the footprints, in the sense of the Second Noble Truth says the cause of Dukkha is lobha, moha, dosa— greed, ill will, and stupidity or ignorance. Well, the Paticcasamuppada starts with ignorance and winds up in Dukkha, and there the feelings are, right there in the middle. That's amazing that it's just a teaching. And not only that, but the five aggregates are added to that teaching of Paticcasamuppada in the sense of there is no self in those aggregates. Like the body. You are not the body. Many people are confused about that. They're so confused we have entire industries like cosmetics. How about Gucci, Prada, high fashion, jeans? All of this kind of stuff is 'I am the body.' I am— or another expression would be 'the clothes make the man.' Have you ever heard that expression.

**Speaker B:** The.

**Speaker A:** Clothes make the man. How you're dressed determines how you fit into society. And that was especially true in the 1930s, when you either wore a business suit or you were in rags. Even if your business suit was a rag, at least you were wearing a business suit. And you still see that very much hung over. All the politicians still wear business suits, but many CEOs don't bother wearing those business suits anymore. It's only the politicians now, or maybe the anchors on the newscast. But a clear example of that is Vladimir Zelensky, who is the Prime Minister of Ukraine; he wears a T-shirt. But Putin, he wears a business suit. There's the example there: the clothes make the man. At least in Putin's eyes. So, if we can get out of that and recognize, no, your mind is what makes difference, not how we're dressed. The mind is the forerunner, the mind is how we decide all of that. And so, we can begin to disregard how people are dressed, and start looking at, first off, their behavior, because their behavior will reveal how they feel. You know, you won't ever know what they're thinking, but at least you can see their behavior and you can read how they feel. And so we can only do that when we're watching, when we remember to look. And if we can see that in.

**Speaker B:** Other people, we can also see our own feelings, we can see our own behavior, But with our own mind, we can also see the thoughts. Some of them are very fast. Those thoughts actually influence. And so the mind is the forerunner. And so getting a hold of the mind and recognize you can change the mind, you can change the mind and change it into the way that will guide you into the feelings that you want to have. And so if you want to feel safe, then talk to yourself about the fact that you are safe right now. The boogeyman is not under your bed.

**Speaker A:** The bear is not in the closet.

**Speaker B:** The police are not breaking down the door. Wow, I can feel safe. And yet many of us will sit in meditation and feel unsafe and not even aware that they feel unsafe. They begin to recognize, oh, I've got anxiety. I wonder where that came from. It came from not feeling safe. If you feel safe and secure and comfortable, then there is no reason to have any fear. And so we actually practice telling ourselves, no fear, nothing to worry about, no dangers, no pythons, no rattlesnakes, no crocodiles, nothing's there. What a relief! No jobs to do. Nothing to do, no place to go. Wow, I can just relax. So we practice this over and over and over again, getting that mind straightened out to where there's no place to go and nothing to do. You can just relax. There's nothing dangerous, nothing needs to be done.

**Speaker A:** I don't need to get enlightened.

**Speaker B:** I just need to enjoy the enlightenment that there is there now when I'm light. Not heavy. But if I want enlightenment, then I feel already heavy. You can recognize that wanting something that we don't have. And that's very common for meditators of wanting enlightenment, and they wind up not getting the benefit out of their meditation because they're not getting what they wanted. So they tell themselves, oh, well, you got to do this for years and then you can get it, rather than.

**Speaker A:** Oh no, all I have to do.

**Speaker B:** Is change my style and get it right now. You're already enlightened. Get over it. Just relax. You've already won. It's an easy practice, but we have to do it over and over and over again.

**Speaker A:** Um, I was talking to a psychiatrist.

**Speaker B:** And mentioned it like this: that most people will go to a psychologist or.

**Speaker A:** To a therapist and have a session.

**Speaker B:** Of therapy and to get a whole lot of good advice and get a.

**Speaker A:** Whole lot of good insights, and then they go home, then they come back next week and do it again. And that has the quality of— imagine that a kid is playing, let us say, taking piano lessons. When you take piano lessons, when you go home, you need to practice the piano so that you can be ready for the next lesson. But if the child has no piano, then what good is it going to do him to take piano lessons for 30 minutes once a week? That's the way that psychology is, or that's religion. Oh, I'll be religious on Sunday morning, and the rest of the week.

**Speaker B:** No.

**Speaker A:** Piano to practice, except that the beautiful part is, is that we've got two of the most important things that we.

**Speaker B:** Need to practice with everywhere we go. We've got our breath and we've got our mind. You're ready to go, you're ready to practice wherever you are. All we have to do is remember, remember to practice. Practice what? Feeling good. Practice feeling safe. Practice feeling comfortable. Practice relaxing. Practicing sabai. Sabai is the Thai word for everything is okay. And we need to practice that over and over again because heretofore we've been practicing, oh, I've got to go do.

**Speaker A:** This, oh, I've got to go do.

**Speaker B:** That, or this needs to be done, or what can I do next.

**Speaker A:** And so we have to change that.

**Speaker B:** Habit into all the work that needed to be done has already been done. Now it's time to take a lunch break. The whistle just blew. He just blew the whistle. Ah, time to take a rest. You have to remember to blow the whistle. And so that's why I recommend that whistle would be when— use the chair as that whistle. That as soon as you stand up, remember to figure out why did I leave my chair? I was comfortable and happy before I got up. What was possibly so important that it made me get up out of my chair? So we can look at our feelings, look at our mind. How many times, Laurent, do you get out of your chair every day? 30, 40, 50 times?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, probably 30.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so that's 30 times opportunities to practice right then.

**Speaker A:** How many of them can you remember?

**Speaker C:** Uh, at the moment, not much.

**Speaker A:** Well, in the beginning, not so much, but you keep practicing and pretty soon.

**Speaker B:** You'Ll remember it a lot. In fact, you'll get up every time.

**Speaker A:** You get up and you'll have a big smile or maybe even a joke. Ah, caught that one!

**Speaker C:** Yeah, sometimes I even sit back down.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, sometimes you just sit back down. There's no reason to get up. We just got up because we weren't.

**Speaker B:** Watching what the mind was doing, and so something happened and then we felt, and then we got up and we went, when in fact there was no need to do any of that at all.

**Speaker A:** This is about enough that we've had today on this one theme of it's.

**Speaker B:** A simple practice and it works for everybody.

**Speaker A:** Doesn't matter what clinical diagnosis, doesn't matter what pills you take, it doesn't matter.

**Speaker B:** What you think your problems are.

**Speaker A:** The only problem you've got is you.

**Speaker B:** Don'T remember that you don't have any problems.

**Speaker A:** So Christian, do you have anything to.

**Speaker B:** Say before we finish?

**Speaker D:** No, nothing else. Just, uh, thank you. Thank you for reminding us over and over about this.

**Speaker A:** Over and over again. That's right, that's how it goes. We have to keep reminding, remembering, remind— that's why I get such a kick out of my students, just because that makes me remember. Arahant, do you have anything?

**Speaker C:** No, that was good. I enjoyed it.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** All right. Well, we'll see you guys later then.

**Speaker C:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Thank you so much. You made it. I mean, you made my day. This has been really great.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. Have a good day, guys.

**Speaker A:** Bye.

**Speaker C:** Bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, the core summary is as follows:

**Main Theme:** The Buddha's teaching (Dhamma) is profoundly simple, universal ("one-size-fits-all"), and applicable in every present moment. The complexity found in various lists (like the Eightfold Path, Enlightenment Factors, Five Faculties) are just different angles describing the same core practice.

**Key Points:**

1.  **Simplicity Within Complexity:** The many Buddhist lists and teachings are like pieces of a single jigsaw puzzle. They all point to the same essential practice: working with the mind to end dissatisfaction (*dukkha*).
2.  **The Core Mechanism:** All human experience follows a cycle: **Thought → Feeling → Action**. The mind is the forerunner. By changing our thoughts, we change our feelings, which changes our actions. This is where true freedom lies, unlike societal systems that only regulate outward behavior.
3.  **Universal Application:** This practice benefits everyone, regardless of psychological diagnosis or life situation. The fundamental problem is universal: we are born into a habit of dissatisfaction and self-criticism, seeking external validation, instead of cultivating internal nourishment and safety.
4.  **Practice is Moment-to-Moment:** Liberation is not a distant future goal from long meditation retreats. It is about **"waking up" right now**. The path is using daily life itself as practice.
5.  **Practical Anchors for Awareness:**
    *   **Using Your Chair:** When you get up from a chair, pause in a standing posture. Ask, *"Why did I get up?"* This reveals the thought-feeling impulse driving your action. It's a chance to interrupt automatic behavior.
    *   **When Sitting Down:** Use the act of sitting as a moment to consciously relax both body and mind, taking "a load off" mentally.
6.  **The Central Practice - *Ānāpānasati* (Mindfulness of Breathing):** This is presented as the Buddha's primary meditation. It's not passive observation but **active training**:
    *   **Change the Mind:** Intentionally change thoughts (like switching from "red" to "green" in the imagination).
    *   **Change the Body:** Use conscious, relaxed breathing to create a feeling of safety, security, and comfort in the body.
    *   **Change the Feeling:** This safe, relaxed state of body and mind naturally cultivates satisfaction (*sukkha*), the opposite of dissatisfaction (*dukkha*). We learn we are not our feelings (e.g., "I am not anger, but I see anger").
7.  **Right Effort is Repetition:** The "difficulty" of practice is just forgetting. When an unwholesome thought returns, you remove it again. Success is in the persistent repetition of applying the skill, not in never having the thought.
8.  **You Already Have the Tools:** You don't need special equipment. You always have your breath and your mind. The entire practice is to **remember**: remember you are safe now, remember you can relax, remember you can change your mind, remember you don't have a problem in this very moment.

**Conclusion:** The Dhamma is a simple, moment-to-moment practice of using awareness to break the cycle of reactive thought-feeling-action. By remembering to "wake up" throughout the day—using simple anchors—we can cultivate a nourished, safe, and satisfied mind, free from the habit of criticism and dissatisfaction. The goal is not to *become* enlightened later, but to relax into the enlightened (light, peaceful) awareness available right now.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on your transcript, the primary speaker (Speaker A) uses several core metaphors and stories to explain Buddhist teachings and meditation practice. Here is a breakdown:

### **Core Metaphors**

1.  **The Jigsaw Puzzle without the Box:**
    *   **What it is:** The Buddha's teachings are compared to a complex jigsaw puzzle.
    *   **Meaning:** When the teachings came to the West, it was like receiving the puzzle pieces without the picture on the box. This made it seem confusing and fragmented (with its many lists like the 8-fold path, 5 faculties, etc.). The point is that all these pieces actually fit together into one coherent, simple picture when you have the guiding overview (the "box").

2.  **The One Law vs. Complex Legal Codes:**
    *   **What it is:** Modern legal/psychological systems are contrasted with the Buddha's one rule.
    *   **Meaning:** Societies create countless laws and diagnostic codes to manage complex behaviors. The Buddha's teaching simplifies this to a single, universal law: **Dukkha (suffering/dissatisfaction) and Nirodha (its cessation).** If you see dissatisfaction, move toward satisfaction. A noble mind doesn't need complex external rules.

3.  **The Mind as the Forerunner (vs. Society's Focus on Action):**
    *   **What it is:** A contrast between the Buddha's view and a common societal/legal view.
    *   **Meaning:** Society often says only actions matter ("you can think about robbing a bank, but only the act is illegal"). The Buddha teaches that **the mind is the forerunner**—thoughts lead to feelings, which lead to actions. Fixing the mind at the thought level prevents harmful actions. The speaker uses the analogy of writing in water (thoughts), sand (speech), and stone (actions) to illustrate how society prioritizes what lasts (actions), while Buddhism addresses the source (the mind).

4.  **Changing Colors (Red to Green):**
    *   **What it is:** A simple mental exercise.
    *   **Meaning:** To demonstrate how easy it is to change one's mind. You can think of red, then choose to think of green. This proves we have the innate ability to redirect our thoughts, which is the first step in changing our feelings and actions.

5.  **The Chair as an Anchor / The Whistle:**
    *   **What it is:** A daily activity (getting out of a chair) turned into a mindfulness practice.
    *   **Meaning:** The act of standing up becomes a "whistle" or "anchor" to wake up. By pausing after standing and asking, *"Why did I get up?"* you interrupt the automatic cycle of thought-feeling-action. This brings you into the present moment and allows you to see your motivation clearly.

### **Key Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Birth Story & Childhood Bonding:**
    *   **What it is:** The speaker recounts his own birth ("enormous hot tub... Dr. Young... beating my ass") and the developmental need for bonding.
    *   **Meaning:** We are born into dissatisfaction (the first yell). Early nurturing provides unconditional love, but around age 4-6, it shifts to conditions and criticism. The Buddhist path is about mentally returning to that early state of being "okay," nourished, and playful—but with adult wisdom.

2.  **The Piano Lesson with No Piano:**
    *   **What it is:** An analogy for weekly therapy or religious practice without daily work.
    *   **Meaning:** Going to a therapist or church once a week is like taking a piano lesson but having no piano to practice on at home. In contrast, Buddhist practice has the "piano" (your breath and mind) with you always. The key is to **remember** to practice moment-to-moment.

3.  **The Student Who Forgot 10 Steps:**
    *   **What it is:** A common experience students report when using the "chair" practice.
    *   **Meaning:** Even if you remember the practice 10 steps after leaving the chair, that moment of remembrance is still valuable. It highlights how often we act on autopilot. The instruction is to **stop right then** and investigate the impulse. This builds the mindfulness "muscle."

4.  **Zelensky's T-shirt vs. Putin's Suit:**
    *   **What it is:** A modern political example.
    *   **Meaning:** Illustrates the saying "the clothes make the man." It shows how society judges by appearance. The Buddhist point is to see past this—**the mind is the forerunner**, not the clothes. We should observe behavior to understand feelings, and work to understand our own thoughts.

### **Unifying Themes of the Metaphors & Stories:**
*   **Simplicity vs. Perceived Complexity:** The puzzle metaphor argues the teachings are fundamentally simple.
*   **Immediacy & Accessibility:** The color-changing, chair anchor, and breath practices show that awakening is a moment-to-moment choice available **right now**, not a distant future goal.
*   **Internal Authority vs. External Rules:** The "one law" and "mind as forerunner" metaphors emphasize internal mind training over complying with external complexity.
*   **Breaking Autopilot:** The chair story and the cycle of thought-feeling-action are all about interrupting habitual, unconscious patterns to regain freedom and choice.
