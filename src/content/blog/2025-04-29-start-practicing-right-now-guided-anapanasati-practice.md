### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So let's start practicing now. Somebody asked for a bit of a guided meditation. Are we ready for that? All right, so whether you close your eyes or not is up to you. I don't care, but it's sometimes better to let the eyes go off into either a gaze having the eyes what they call half closed and just looking down, or you can close the eyes altogether. And then to start off, we're going to take a deep breath and relax. And as we're relaxing, think of it as going down, down, down. Or another way of saying that, we're turning the volume down. We're letting things get settled, easy and quiet, so that we're beginning to focus not on what we're thinking but on the sound of the voice. We're not going to be making up any stories other than the story that we're talking about of just settling down and getting quiet, getting rested. So as we imagine this, imagine yourself in an elevator, just going down, down, down from the 9th floor to the 8th floor. We can relax a bit from the 8th floor to the 7th floor and take a deep breath and relax. And from the 7th floor, we're going down deeper into the 6th floor, then down to the 5th. And as we're relaxing more and more, we can just feel really good for a moment. Everything is okay, everything is quiet. And then we go down to the 5th floor, then to the 4th floor. Things are getting very relaxed, very easy, very comfortable. You can check your body to make sure that the body is comfortable and you can relax. Down to the fourth, then to the third, down to the first floor. And then as the elevator door opens, we step out into a very beautiful place. Everything is okay. Everything is quiet. No machines around, nothing to do, and no place to go. And so we can take a deep breath and just relax. Everything is fine. Not a care in the world. Now the question is, can we keep that? Let's just try to rest with that. You're okay right now. Everything is okay. Everything is quiet. And so these are the kind of thoughts that we're going to have. Everything is okay. Everything is easygoing. We can relax. And if the mind wanders away, never mind, start again. Come back, come back. Everything is okay. Everything is easygoing. No place to go, nothing to do. Everything just be okay. Take another deep breath. Just relax. If the mind wanders away, never mind, just keep coming back. Wherever the mind is going to, you can catch that and say, right now everything is all right. In fact, what we're doing is we're gladdening the mind. We can see that there's nothing to think about, nothing to worry about, there's nothing dangerous. Everything is okay right now. We feel comfortable. If the mind wanders away, never mind, we're all right. Let it wander just enough to see it, then come back. We're in control of the mind. We can become easygoing. We can become glad. We can brighten the mind. In fact, we can become satisfied. Everything is okay right now. Everything is all right. Not a problem, not a care in the world. We can keep practicing that. And if the mind wanders away, never mind. Come back. Come back to here now with the thought everything is okay, not a problem in the world. We could just relax, relax and feel good. We can actually begin to change the way that we feel. By changing our thoughts, we can change our attitude, and with our attitude, we can change the way we feel so that you can feel good. Everything is okay. Not a problem in the world. Everything is all right. So we can come around to, you know, I could do this. I could do this. Anytime that I sit down, I can settle down, I can become relaxed, I can become successful at this, I could become satisfied. Then I can become successful. Wow, this actually feels good. I could do this. Everything is all right. Not a problem in the world, and I'm in charge of that world. I can do it. I'm the boss here. It feels so good to finally be in control of the way we feel. Ah, what a relaxing it is. Everything is all right. Everything is fine. And so as we are doing this, we don't have to do anything else. Don't have to play with the computer or fiddle around. We can just relax. Stay relaxed. Everything is all right. Arahant, not a problem in the world. We can rest with this, feel good. And as we stay here feeling good, we can begin to come back again. We can finish this little exercise off, but keep that good feeling going. Keeping that sense of we've got this. Keep that sense of everything is okay and everything is all right because that's my attitude right now. And so we can begin to come back a bit. Come back, get into that elevator, begin to just ascend back into ordinary senses. So we get on the ground floor and we come up to the first, second, third, up to the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth floors. And that's the door to open to reality. So now you can open your eyes, take a deep breath, and say, wow, I feel so good. I feel good. So this is the way that you would practice. You might be able to take this recording and play it several times, but eventually you can make this practice your own practice.


### Summary

Based on the transcript, here is a summary of the Dhamma talk and guided meditation with Dhammarato (Speaker A):

**Core Theme:** A practical, accessible guided meditation focused on cultivating relaxation, contentment, and present-moment awareness by intentionally "gladdening" or brightening the mind.

**Key Instructions & Process:**

1.  **Preparation:** Settle in, with eyes softly closed or gazing down. The initial instruction is to "turn the volume down" on mental activity.
2.  **Guided Descent:** Uses the metaphor of an elevator descending from the 9th floor to the ground floor. With each floor, the instruction is to relax more deeply, releasing tension and busyness.
3.  **Arrival at a Peaceful State:** At the "ground floor," one imagines stepping into a beautiful, quiet place with "nothing to do, and no place to go." The core mantra becomes: **"Everything is okay. Everything is all right. Not a problem in the world."**
4.  **Working with the Mind:** The central practice is to repeatedly return to this thought of contentment whenever the mind wanders. The attitude is gentle: "never mind, start again." This is framed as taking control of one's mental state and choosing to feel good.
5.  **The "Gladdening" Technique:** The speaker explicitly names this process as **"gladdening the mind."** By consciously choosing thoughts of safety and satisfaction ("I could do this," "I'm in charge"), one changes their attitude, which in turn changes how they feel.
6.  **Reinforcement of Agency:** Emphasis is placed on the practitioner's power: *"I'm the boss here. It feels so good to finally be in control of the way we feel."*
7.  **Ascent & Integration:** The meditation concludes by ascending back up the elevator to ordinary awareness, carrying the "good feeling" and the attitude that "everything is okay" back into daily life.

**Underlying Dhamma Points:**
*   **Mind is the Foremost:** The practice demonstrates the Buddha's teaching that the mind is the root of experience. By skillfully directing thoughts, we shape our emotional reality.
*   **Cultivation of *Pāmojja* (Joy/Gladness):** This is a direct exercise in generating one of the early factors of awakening—a joyful, relaxed interest that supports deeper concentration.
*   **Gentle Persistence:** The instruction to gently return without self-criticism mirrors the development of mindfulness and right effort.
*   **Accessibility:** The talk emphasizes that this is a simple, repeatable practice anyone can learn and own, encouraging the listener to use the recording and eventually internalize the method.

**In essence,** this is not a talk about doctrine, but a direct, encouraging **training in taking agency over one's mental and emotional state** through a simple, repetitive technique of relaxing the body and cultivating thoughts of contentment and safety in the present moment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several key metaphors and a central story to guide the meditation and convey its principles:

### **Primary Metaphors:**

1.  **The Volume Dial:** "We're turning the volume down." This metaphor frames relaxation and focus as a process of reducing mental noise and stimulation.
2.  **Gladdening/Brightening the Mind:** The mind is portrayed as something that can be made happier, lighter, and more luminous through intentional thought. ("we're gladdening the mind," "we can brighten the mind").
3.  **Being the Boss / In Charge:** The practitioner is encouraged to see themselves as the authority over their inner state. ("I'm in charge of that world. I can do it. I'm the boss here.").
4.  **Changing the Channel of Thought:** While not explicitly stated as "changing the channel," the instruction to shift from wandering thoughts to the mantra "everything is okay" acts as a metaphor for consciously selecting your mental content.

### **The Central Guiding Story / Extended Metaphor:**

The core structure of the meditation is built around a **story of descending and ascending in an elevator.**

*   **The Descent (Relaxation & Letting Go):** The practitioner imagines starting on the 9th floor and going down, floor by floor, with each level representing a deeper state of relaxation and quiet. This is the journey inward, away from busy surface-level consciousness.
*   **The Beautiful Place (The Goal State):** The elevator opens on the ground floor to "a very beautiful place. Everything is okay. Everything is quiet. No machines around, nothing to do, and no place to go." This is the metaphorical destination—a state of peaceful, contented presence.
*   **The Ascent (Integration):** To conclude, the practitioner gets back in the elevator and ascends back up to the "tenth floor," which is described as "the door to open to reality." This part of the story symbolizes integrating the calm, controlled state back into ordinary, waking awareness.

### **How They Work Together:**

The **elevator story** provides a simple, structured narrative for the journey of the meditation. The **supporting metaphors (volume dial, boss, gladdening)** explain the *how* and *why* of the practice within that story. Together, they create a multi-sensory guide:
*   The story gives a **spatial and visual** framework (going down, arriving somewhere peaceful).
*   The metaphors explain the **mental and emotional** process (reducing noise, taking control, cultivating positivity).

The overall message, woven through these metaphors and stories, is that peace and control are internal states you can access through a deliberate, practiced journey of the mind.
