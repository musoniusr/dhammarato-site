### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, so that was quick. And so it's good to see everybody. 3 of you are here on, uh, in Thailand right now. One on Koh Samui, the other 2 on this island, Koh Phangan. And that, uh, Rick asked about, uh, Paticcasamuppada or dependent origination, and that's always a very good topic. Topic worthy of discussion, and I invite each one of you to enter in and discuss with us. The first thing to say is that dependent origination, or Paticcasamuppada, actually is a deeper explanation of the Second Noble Truth. And what Paticcasamuppada, the Pali term, means is— and by the way, dependent origination is actually correct, it's just not a very good translation. In other words, anything that comes about, anything that originates, is dependent on upon some causes or conditions. That's really what it means. And we can see then that the Second Noble Truth means that Dukkha has a cause. There is a reason for it. And it is not, as the Christians say, an act of God But even if it were an act of God, God caused it, he did it. He may have done it inadvertently, because that's how almost everything happens, is nobody's paying attention and things just kind of happen. Things just kind of fall apart. And we could also say that things go that way, that people are not paying attention, and so things happen dependently because there's no one there to stop it. And so basically what it means is Paticcasamuppada is the various little detailed steps that wind us up in a state of dissatisfaction. That's what it means. And Just like Dukkha or dissatisfaction, in the Second Noble Truth we have both liking and not liking, greed or ill-will, or lust and disappointment, always happens because of ignorance. If we are wise, we can put a stop to it. Before we get into a state of dissatisfaction, or we can divert the little dissatisfactions from becoming big dissatisfactions. That's basically what it means, and that there's nothing magical about it. And so the first step, or the first stage of Paticcasamuppada is always ignorance. Ignorance is at the foundation on all cases. It's the foundation that we start off as children. When little kids are pretty ignorant, they're pretty stupid. They can't even find the tit. They don't know what to do with hands. They can't change their own diapers. They don't speak language. They're pretty stupid. Have ever any, any one of you been around babies? They're pretty stupid, and they're also dependent because they're stupid, which means that they're ignorant. And as we grow up, we make decisions stupidly, and then we live our lives according to the plan, or according to the decisions, or the rules that we made about how things are supposed to be. And we live our lives that way, in stupidity. We're not paying attention to what's going on. That's the basic point of the Second Noble Truth, is that dissatisfaction comes because we're not paying attention. So the first example that I'll give to that, my favorite in fact, you're in the middle of the night, it's quite dark, you go to the bathroom, and on the way to the bathroom you stub your toe. Now, is that an ignorance or is that delusion? Anybody got an answer to that? Is that ignorance or delusion that we stub our toe on the way to the bathroom in the middle of the night? Not a hint. No, I mean, it's just a yes or no question.

**Speaker B:** It's a delusion.

**Speaker A:** It's a delusion, exactly. Why? Because the original ignorance was, is that I know my way to the bathroom and I can make it to the bathroom without turning the lights on. I know where the furniture is, I know. And because we think we know, we don't look, and we wind up stubbing our toe. That if in fact the right thing to do would be, if I'm not sure that I can get to the bathroom, because somebody might have moved some furniture, or I don't quite remember the way, then the right thing to do is to shine a light on it. Look at where we're going, being able to see. In fact, we, by turning the light on, we would in fact become enlightened on the way to the bathroom. So this is where everything starts. It starts with us not paying attention are not analyzing, that we will take people's words for things. And we've been doing that our whole life, so it's quite an old habit that we have of just taking people's word for it, assume that we know. For instance, the woman on the way to work is using her cell phone, driving her car, lollygagging around, looking around, thinking that she knows. I mean, every day she gets to work, she knows how to drive a car. And then she wrecks because she's not paying attention. Then in fact, all of those times that she did make it to work, maybe she wasn't paying much attention, but somehow or another she got to work. But anytime that someone has an automobile wreck or an automobile accident, it's because they're not paying attention, they're not looking at where they're going. Just like we would get to the bathroom. Okay, so this is the foundation of it. This is so important that I need to keep harping on it over and over again, is that all of our dissatisfaction really comes from our ignorance. Now, in the Mahayana, I've heard them say many times that the cause of Dukkha, or the cause of dissatisfaction, is grasping and clinging. And that's actually not quite correct, that it has grasping and clinging in it, but it's got ignorant grasping and clinging. So an example of Vinaya, we could say, is that there is such a thing as wise grasping and clinging, rather than ignorant or stupid or delusional grasping and clinging. The example of that would be: wise grasping and clinging is that you only want things that you can easily get. For instance, you can get all the way through high school by being satisfied with a C, but then they tell you, "Oh, you're not supposed to be satisfied with a C, you've got to make an A." And then you make a C, and now you've got disappointment and delusion. You were grasping and clinging at something that you couldn't get, instead of being satisfied with something that you could get. Now, how many of you have a rule saying, oh, would it be better to have an A? How many of you have that idea? Yeah, okay. Guess what? If you think that you should be making an A and you make a C, how do you feel? Yeah. But if you think that the C is okay and you make a C, how do you feel? Good. All right, so this is the whole idea, is that if we set our standards too high, we're going to bound to have disappointment because we can't reach those standards. But if we set the standards lower, we can get them. So wanting things that you can have would be the easy way out. And you would be satisfied. And so one of the ways that we can look at this is that stop attaching to and having very, very high standards, because we feel bad when we don't live up to the scratch of some rule or something. So with ignorance as the foundation, basis, and starting point, over time We build up ignorant choices and ignorant decisions. The example of the ignorant decision is, "Oh, you've got to make good grades." But we picked up a lot of them. In fact, I was just telling Kat today that I made a decision that I had to keep up with my dad, that I was slow, that he actually was an Anagami, He was a short guy, but he was fast. I don't think anybody could keep up with him walking. He was a walking— I mean, he made a living off of walking. Because in the old days, you couldn't drive by and have your cell phone-like device just pick up the meter number and the amount on it. Oh no, you had to go and stand with your book and read that meter. And so he walked a lot. And then at about the age of 4, he started fussing at me, "Keep up!" He wants a 4-year-old to keep up with a professional walker. And so I started into that, thinking that I've got to be in a hurry, I've got to keep up, I've got to catch up. And I spent quite a number of years, into my 40s, trying to be in a hurry, trying to catch up. Which led to fast motorbikes and all kinds of stuff. Anxiety, mostly. And so we pick up these things ignorantly. How many of you have anxiety, let us say, on a regular basis? You have anxiety. What is anxiety? It's a feeling, a sensation in the chest, in the body. The body is reacting to the mind telling us that things aren't good enough yet, you've got to hurry up, you've got to get it done. And so, the easy way then to start dealing with this stuff is to see it, to recognize it, and to start counterbalancing it with the facts, is that I don't have to keep up with my dad. In fact, it's not a very good idea because he died in 1973. I don't think any of you are even old enough. So this whole idea then is that we build this stuff up ignorantly. We pile on making rules that we have to live by. This is called Samskara. It's compounded, it's piled together, and in fact it is a big pile of stuff, rather than organizing. It's not a library. Our rule system is a big pile of stuff, and there's no telling what little rule that we've made is going to come up next out of that pile. So, if we can understand that we build up a past, of shoulds, woulds, coulds, ought-tos, and how things should be, setting standards, deciding what the world is and how it should be as children. So, now that we see those two things, let's fast forward to the modern point of whenever we gain data through the senses. We call that consciousness in the sense of eye consciousness. You can see things. Now what the eyes actually pick up is shapes, colors, sizes, movements, and everything else is interpreted based upon our ability to put together things that are coming out of this old database of Samskara that we have. Now the little example that I will use is one time I came out of a store and was walking down the street and I saw for the first time in my life someone carrying a French horn, not in the case, but he was carrying that French horn under his arm. A fiberglass, a white fiberglass. Well, I'm all into white fiberglass sousaphones. I had one when I was in high school. I had another one when I was in university. And so I know what white fiberglass brass instruments look like. And so I had to go over and check that thing out. And what I saw when I got close enough, when I investigated it, he was carrying a white Frisbee and white tennis shoes. But my mind had put and constructed something based upon my past. Now, if I had been out there with white tennis shoes throwing Frisbees for my young life, I probably would not have made that mistake. That was my ignorance. That really profoundly hit me, because I was already into the Dharma when I said that, and I said, "Ha ha! I see where that cuff comes from." That white French horn came from my white sousaphone, and people don't make white French horns, they don't make them. They don't— there's no reason that in fact the fiberglass doesn't give us nearly as good a sound as the brass itself, and there's no reason to make a French horn. But that's what my mind did. So we do that kind of stuff on a regular basis. We construct the reality that we have right in front of us by gathering up some old data from the past. And building it up. And we live our lives like that. We live a life not in actual reality. We live our lives based upon the delusional manufacture of data. So I'm actually talking about Paticcasamuppada, the early parts of it. All right, what is that made-up stuff? What is that manufacturing process? Is called nama-rupa. It also has the Pali word of Vinaya— excuse me, Sannyā— that Vinaya is actually consciousness. Now, this tree right here is conscious. How do I know the tree is conscious? Because I can see it bending towards the light. I can see the leaves blowing in the wind. That those leaves are affected by that. This is what we mean by consciousness, that the tree is aware somehow of the wind blowing. It is aware somehow of the light from the sun, and it will bend towards the light. You go to any forest, you can see consciousness all over the place. You can also go so far as to put it this way: What is consciousness? A light switch is conscious, because when you flip that switch, the light switch knows to make contact with two pieces of metal, which then will turn the light on. So what we mean by that is taking sensory input. The light has a switch, which is kind of a sensory input. The tree has a photo— photon, or whatever the stuff is that's inside of a leaf. And that leaf responds to the light and wants more of it, and so the leaf will actually bend towards the light to get more of it. So consciousness is not a big deal at all. Not at the raw level, not until it's processed. Now, with the example of the process of a light switch, the light turns on. With the example of the leaf on the tree, photosynthesis happens. It gains energy, it can stay alive because it gets that. So actual bare consciousness is ordinary. It's all over the place. We do it with our eyes, we do it with our ears. Our ears will vibrate. Those guys who've got headphones on, little speakers inside the headphones will vibrate the sound, and you pick that up. Now there's a whole lot of stuff happening that we don't pick up, that we don't listen to, that we don't respond to. That we think that we know it already, and so we're not paying much attention to it. So this is where the ignorance comes in, is when we're simply not paying attention to the surroundings around us and responding to it with consciousness, so that when we then process it, we do so ignorantly. In English we use the word perception. In the translation of the Pali, one of the words that I mentioned was nama-rupa. What does that mean? Rupa is real, like a statue of the Buddha is called a Buddha rupa, it's physical. The eyes pick up sights that are visible, that are real. The ears pick up sounds. That are real, we can hear them, touch, taste, all of the senses are consciousness, but we feed that into a processor that is called perception. And so we perceive things, and how we perceive it is with the built-up stuff that we've done with the past. So an example that I would use— anybody here know what OCR, optical character recognition, is? When you take a picture of writing and you take a picture of that, you feed it into the camera, and then software will scan that image and then go into its database of characters and pull those characters out and match it so that it'll turn that image into text. The same thing is true when software will listen to audio sounds, pick up the voice, put that through its database, and come out with text. This is what we do in the human mind. It is called perception. We perceive, or we manufacture things, and the mind is very fast. This stuff can happen really, really fast. And the outcome of perception then, in the Pali, is called 'saliyatana.' Saliyatana, actually the word 'atana' is the senses, but saliyatana is a manufactured set of senses. An example of that is that everybody has seen a cartoon before, and so when I say a cartoon, you'll pull up an image of a cartoon, but you get it out of the past. So most of what we have is Salyatana, is remembered rather than new. And this is the basic point, is that we live in the past, we live in old memories, we live in old images, we remember things from the past, and then we repeat them. And I'll take this point. Many times people will say Dhammarato's method. Well, guess what? Dhammarato doesn't have a method. What he has is a pretty good memory, and he remembers what Bhikkhu Buddhadasa said. He remembers what Ajahn Po says. He remembers what he got from the Buddha. And then that's what we come back up with. The question is, how good do I remember? This is actually a training that many, many places people go through, is to be able to remember things the way that they actually were. And that often, especially when we're children and especially when we're ignorant, we make mistakes along the way. In fact, there's three different kinds of mistakes that we make: with memory. One is that we didn't get it in correctly the first time. The example of that would be listening to Pali, the monks chant the Pali, and the first time you hear it, you can't make heads or tails of it. You got to hear it over and over and over again before it begins to register in the senses. Anything, in fact, that's new, we don't get it the first time. That in fact we always compare something brand new with something old. And then if we keep getting new information and getting new information and getting new information, then that's more accurate. But our ignorance says is that, oh, I just need to get it in one time and then I'll collect it and put it together with the past and I'll come up with the correct solution. But oftentimes that first time that we hear it, we don't get it very good. The next problem is that all of our memories are kind of like in a pile of stuff, and who knows what memories are going to come up in our processing right now. And so the way that our information is stored is problematic, and then when we bring it back out, it's not very good. So our memory systems are not very good in the beginning, they're not very good in the storage in the middle, and they're not very good when it comes back out. This is why the Buddha recommends to keep getting new data, to keep staying in consciousness over and over again, rather than relying upon what we think that we know. Going back to that example of getting to the bathroom in the middle of the night is because we think we know the way to the bathroom safely, and we wind up stubbing our toe. Because we're not watching, we're not looking, we are assuming that we already know. So this is really what we're getting into, is the concept of what is right view in the Eightfold Noble Path. Most people think of a view as a concept, like the concept, "I know my way to the bathroom." And yet, we don't. We need to look, we need to investigate, over and over again. So, what we do, because it's kind of the easy way out, is that we come to a conclusion: "Oh, I looked the first time, I looked a couple of times, and now I've got a conclusion, and I know how things are like, and I don't have to look anymore." I don't have to watch anymore. And that's when, like driving the car, "Oh, I know the way to town, I know how to get there, I don't have to watch, the car and myself will somehow get us to there," and then we crash on the way, is because we're not watching where we're going in this present moment. So this teaching of the Buddha about Paticcasamuppada is deeply wrapped up into the Four Noble Truths, most especially with the Second Noble Truth, but here we come in with the Fourth Noble Truth about observation. You have to keep looking. Don't rely upon your past and thinking that you already know, that in fact that is what you would call a concept. And we live our lives in a conceptualized world, and when that world becomes really conceptualized in a hard way, we can call it rules, or this is how things should be, because I've got a concept that I built up over time ignorantly. If we can understand that, we can see where the dangers lie, because that salyatana, the end result, is not what the reality was. It's a constructed reality. We all live in a magical constructed world. We live in a mind, the mind's world, rather than living in our senses. And so the right thing to do in this regard is to pay attention to the senses. Now, there's another point about this, that in fact what we've been talking about with the senses and the body and the Samskara and the built-up stuff, and consciousness, and perception, these are the five things that are referred to as the five aggregates. Anna, you've heard of the five aggregates, right? That's what we've been talking about so far, is the five aggregates which are part of Paticcasamuppada. But the way that the five aggregates are taught is that they are not me. The body is not me. Your body is not you. But we live in a society that is under the delusion that I am the body. So women are taught, "Oh, if I am going to be beautiful, then I have to paint my face with makeup. Because if I apply the makeup, then the face is beautiful, and it's just the paint that's beautiful, it's not the face. But if the face is painted, and the paint is beautiful, then the body underneath that paint is beautiful, and therefore I am beautiful. But the body is just the body. How many of you can be 23 today and 34 tomorrow and 78 the next day and then back to 18? No, we can't change the age of the body. If we could change the age of the body, then we would have good control over it. But even Jesus said you can't change your stature one inch. Well, you could stoop, or you can put on high heels, but you really don't change the body that much. Yeah, you can work out, you can build up muscles, But that's just a process. That the body, in fact— Arnold Schwarzenegger is a good example of that, because when he was Governor of California, he was not Mr. Universe, not anymore. If he had been able to build himself up, then he would have stayed built up, right? But he didn't. And so, things happen naturally. And we are not in control. The body is not mine. Also, the memory system, the Samskara, is faulty; it's not mine. If my memory was the kind of memory that I would be, then I would remember everything in great detail correctly. But in fact, I'm forgetting names all the time now. So, when we recognize that these properties that we're talking about within Paticcasamuppada are not actually very good, they're not up to your own scratch, according to what you would want your body to do, want your consciousness to do, that in fact, that's one of the reasons why we have binoculars and telescopes and Hubble's and James Webb's is because we want to see better and better and better, and we can't see as good as we want to see. If my eyes were as good as my eyes should be, then I would have perfect vision, but we don't. So, we live in an imperfect world, which means that ignorance is built right into the system. And that the way that we can deal with that better is continue to look, to pay attention, to be in the present moment, be in the here-now, use your senses, take in data, because the old data is not reliable. And so the outcomes that people make based upon their past is conceptualized, and we live in a conceptualized world. An example would be that in the old days that they made movies out of film, and that they would let the cameras roll, and then later the film would be cut up, chopped up, they would take the scenes over and over again, and then later they would produce a movie. But the movie that's presented is not the movie that was in the process of being made. Because it had to go through the cutting room floor. And a lot of our memories wind up on our own internal cutting room floor. And so the movies that we make are not reality. The movie that was made that you went to see at the cinema does not show the part about where two of the actors had a fight. Why? Because that part of the movie was cut out. It wasn't part of what the director wanted you to see. So our manufactured movie is what we live in, rather than what's real. And if we keep taking in input, we live in a much clearer reality. We start to pay attention to what we see, pay attention to what we hear. Pay attention to what we feel, rather than relying upon an old set of rules and ways of doing things. And this is the important point up to this time, and here is the clinker: What we live in, our manufactured reality, is what impacts us. Reality doesn't impact us. What impacts us is what we manufacture, what we make up. This is the point in Paticcasamuppada called pañña. What impacts us, what touches us, what gets to us, what gets our goat, is what we made up, not reality. Young men when they, uh, when they're around their dad, they don't like him because they've got a habit of being in the past of not liking dad. That's very, very common in West, that almost every young teenage boy hates his dad. Why? Because over the years his dad told him what to do, and he didn't like it when he was 4 years old. But now that he's a teenager He don't like it, and so every time Dad says something, he gets ticked off, which means then that he's not living with his dad who's in reality. He's living with a dad that he manufactured ignorantly in his own mind. And so Dad can just say something that means nothing to Dad, and it'll trigger that kid saying, ah, There he goes again. That's just being dad. Who got set off was the kid. So if we understand this, this— we're halfway through Paticcasamuppada right then and there. It is in fact this salyatana, or it's the outcome. Now one thing that I'd like to mention here is the word consciousness, because often, especially in groups like philosophy, this is what they mean by consciousness: it's what we manufacture. What we're conscious of is what we manufactured, not conscious of the input. And so there's two kinds of consciousness. One would be, "Oh, I see that," as opposed to, "Oh, I see what you mean," because when I say, "Oh, I see what you mean," that means that I'm trying to understand, I've created something. I'm taking the words that you said and put them together to make a conclusion. So this is one of the reasons why the Dharma is so difficult to teach and demonstrate and get people to understand, is because they don't hear it correctly. They hear what they think that they heard rather than hearing it clearly. This is why the Dhamma is called profound. Difficult to understand is because we try to filter it through everything that we've already known, rather than taking it for face value. And so a lot of students will say, "Oh, I understand what you mean now, and I think I've got it," but they do it only on an intellectual level, to where the Dhamma has to be experienced. You have to actually gain the joy of practicing correctly, rather than saying, "Oh, if I practiced to gain joy, then I would have some." That's an intellectual, that's salyatana. That is not the joy that we can have through the feelings of experiencing it directly. So, we live in a manufactured world, and that manufactured world is what impacts us, and this is where the feelings come from. So recognize that any feeling that you have, a feeling of liking, a feeling of not liking, a feeling of anger, a feeling of anguish, a feeling of panic, anxiety, any feeling you had, you made that up. That was your creation. A real clear example of that is that somebody wins a point in a football match or something, And half the crowd gets very excited and happy, and the other half of the crowd, they don't like it at all. Why is that? They all saw exactly the same thing, except they didn't see exactly the same thing, because they've already got a prepossessed position of, "I like that team and I hate that team." So, when the team that I don't like scores, I don't like it. And when the team that scores, that I like that team, then I feel good. So in that sense, there's no self or you there, that you've decided in advance who you are and what you are, and therefore you're gullible to the situation because you make stuff up and then believe that things are true. And this is where our feelings come from. Our feelings come from ignorance. So I could make the statement is, is that you don't feel the way that you want to feel. You feel the way that you have been trained, ignorantly trained to feel. You don't feel the way that things are nice. You feel the way that you were told to feel. Rather than experiencing things brand new. If you're experiencing things brand new over and over and over again, you get to like it. This is nice. But if we judge it, it's because we've judged it based upon something that we remember from the past. So the teaching of the Buddha then is to spend more and more time in the present moment because it's pleasant in the present, and it is dangerous in the past, and dangerous in the future. But right now, it's good enough. So, our feelings then are also kind of manufactured, beyond our control, ignorantly. But if we have what Bhikkhu Buddhadasa calls wisdom at the point of contact, That means that you cannot regard that salyatana, or the decisions that we made, as a good source of feelings, that you can feel the way you want to feel anyway. Now, how many people would choose to feel good versus how many of you would choose to feel bad? Would you actually choose to feel bad? Then why do you feel bad? Why do you feel bad? You feel bad because you remembered feeling bad when you were a kid, when you didn't have any control over it. Now you're adults, why don't you take control of your life and start feeling the way that you want to feel? Now the next point about these feelings is that if I like something, then I like it, and I like to like it, and I like it around a lot so that I would like it more often, and therefore I like it becomes wanting. I like it, I want it, and then I've got to have it. And what we like, if we choose correctly to like things that we can get, then we'll be happy all the time, because we always get what we want, if we want wisely. But we don't; we want ignorantly, based upon the feelings that arise ignorantly. And because we want things ignorantly, we've got to have it. So this is going in the— let me stop a second and start using some of the Pali. We started with Ajiva, not knowing. Then we have the Sankhara, the old stuff that's built up. Then we have Sanya, the consciousness. Then we have the Namarupa, or the Vinaya. I got those two backwards. Of perception, which then leads to our ideas, our concepts, our points of view, our understanding, our own internal movie, it's called the salyatana, and then that's what impacts us, which is called paśa. And the paśa leads to Vedana, the feelings, and then the Vedana being ignorant, when our feelings are ignorant, We will want things. This is called thirst, or Tanha, and then that grows to the point I've got to have it, I can't live without it, and this is called Upadana. So Upadana then is the real wanting it. This is where the liking becomes a rule, in the sense of what stuff is good and what stuff is bad. This is where judgments come from. Judgments are not based upon observation; judgments are based upon feelings that were based upon decisions about observation. So we make our decisions ignorantly; we want things ignorantly, because we felt ignorantly about it. And so this is where right and wrong comes from, making judgments. I like this, therefore it is good, and I don't like that, therefore it is bad. And this good and bad winds up being a set of rules that we have, or you should have a good life. Well, we don't have a good life, we just have a life. The good and bad is based upon judgments. So this is the point then of time to bring in. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was really fond of the story of Adam and Eve. Now, the story in the Bible of Adam and Eve is often very Christianized in the sense that they're interested in talking snakes, they're interested in blaming Eve or the women for making the men do it. They're interested in fig leaves that they used to hide their sexual parts, and they're interested in the apple itself, the fruit. And they're also interested in God threw them out of paradise. But that's not the story at all. That's really got nothing to do with it. What really is going on is that Adam and Eve ate of the fruit of knowledge of good and evil. They judge things just like we're talking about. They use their feelings of liking and not liking to make up rules about what was good and what was bad. And that's what destroys our paradise. If we stop having feelings about it being good or it being bad, then we can just leave it as it is. It's good enough, it's fine. In fact, I live in a paradise. Until I find something wrong with it, and when I do, then I've just destroyed it. So we destroy our own Paradise; we judge it. And this is how Adam and Eve were thrown out of the Garden of Eden, because they had the knowledge of what is good and what is bad. And every time that you make a judgment, you destroy your paradise. So if we stop making judgments about it and just live in reality, it becomes a paradise again. So at that point, when we do not have a paradise because we have judged it, this is where the Upadana goes wrong. We create then a hell. We go through the process of creating the Four Woeful States. Now the Four Woeful States that are associated with clinging, or with what I would call caring, but I don't think it is a very good translation of Upadana into the word of clinging. A better word would be used, care. I care about this, I care about that. Don't you care about me? Don't you love me? Don't you care about me? Basically what we mean by caring is carrying. If you care for something, you'll carry it around, you'll keep it there. And this is when we start carrying very heavy things, we go into these woeful states. Now, one of the most common woeful states that humans, especially in our society, get into is called the dumb animal. We learned to do this when we were kids. How many of you were— when you were kids, the adults told you what to do? You didn't like it, but you did it anyway. Go clean up your room. And so we go around not liking things that we're told to do. And yet we do it anyway, just like a draft horse or a draft animal. I was in India long ago, and there was a donkey that had a long pole tied to its back, and the other end of that pole was stuck in a mill. And the owner of this little operation had that donkey go around that millstone, around and around, while he poured sugarcane into it, and out came one side was the sugarcane stalk, and the other one was sugarcane juice that he sold for a couple of rupees, 10 rupees or something. Now I ask you, how much of that sugarcane did the donkey get? He didn't get any of it. He might have gotten some of the shaft, but he didn't get any of the juice. How many of you feel like that you're living that life right now, that you're doing what you're told to do? You've got a job, You get your paycheck, but you don't ever get a reward. You don't ever feel content and satisfied with what you're doing, but you're following the rule of you've got to work if you've got to eat. And so we live our lives rule-bound, doing what we're told to do and not getting any satisfaction out of it. That's exactly what happens with the draft animal. A dumb animal does not get the value of his reward. Another example of that is the horse is living in his pasture, and then the farmer gets the idea he's going to plant food in that pasture, and so he straps the plow to the back of the horse and has the horse plow up his deliciously growing pasture, and it's become farmland now. And the farmer grows all kinds of stuff, like perhaps zucchini, cauliflower, asparagus, okra. Well, guess how many of that stuff does the horse get? None of it. He is at a dead loss. All he gets after that is hay. He used to have a delicious pasture to live in, and now he doesn't get to live in that pasture. Now the dirt farmer gets all the benefit. How many of you feel like that? That's how it is with you and your boss, that the bosses and the big guys at the corporation get all the benefit of your work and you don't get anything? You might get a paycheck, but that's not rewarding. So this is the woeful animal state. There's also hell states. Another one is the state of an Anagami, called a preta. What is that? It's very much like a great big bottle that has a tiny little neck. It's almost like trying to breathe with your nostrils stuck up, stuffed up, and your mouth closed. You can't get much air that way. You can't breathe. And this is what the Piti is, okay? And what that is, is we want stuff and we don't get it. We want stuff and we don't get it. And we get hungry. This is why we call it the hungry ghost, is because we never get filled up, we never feel satisfied, we never get enough. How many of you ever felt like that? How about getting hot, getting angry, not getting what you want? This is the hell state. So these woeful states are actually quite natural for us, and that we could actually link them in with the instincts. That we do what we're told to do is very much like the nesting instinct. Being afraid, the asura, is like the territorial instinct, where we're unsure, we don't know, that's foreign to us. Instead of being happy in investigating, we get confused because we don't know what to make of it because we don't have the correct evidence in our memory systems, in the Samskara. And so we go into all of these hell states, which is then the Dukkha. We get hot, we get afraid, We do what we were told to do and we wind up not getting what we want. So this is the state of Bhavana, or Bhava. Now somebody just asked me the other, uh, at the beginning of our thing about Deepa Bhavan. Deepa Bhavan is actually— it means the light of the beginning. The Bhavana is the bhava, or the beginning of stuff, the growth. You could think of it kind of metaphorically as the pregnancy that gives birth to the full-blown dukkha. But if you shine a light on it, then your development is not going to lead to dukkha, it's going to lead to easygoing. So this is it. This is the teaching. I'll give it to you very quickly in the Pali. Okay, we start with ignorance, Ajiva. We go through the Samskara building up process. We go into Vinaya, or consciousness. We take what we get as an input, put it through our processor that we call perception, that is known as nama-rupa, making names for things. From that, we come up with the salyatana, our own movie. And from that, that's what impacts us, that's what touches us, that's what gets our goat. It's not the reality that we were only half paying attention to, it's the reality that we made up, and that's the basis of our feelings, and the feelings are also ignorant. Now, we should at least take the point of saying, well, where does practice of Anapanasati, where does the practice of the Eightfold Noble Path come into this? The answer to that is to begin to remember that you have control over what you're going to create, so that you can create something that's good, valuable, and wholesome, and then let that contact you, so that you have control over your feelings. You can feel the way that you want to feel; you don't have to feel the way that you've been trained to feel. And with wisdom, that way, you can choose to want the things that you can have and stop wanting the things that you can't have. Because if you want things that you can't have, you wind up being the Hungry Ghost. If you go around doing what you think that you should be doing, then you're the dumb animal doing what you were told to do, except that right now nobody's telling you to do it. You remember to do that. You made those rules up. And now you go around following the rules and you don't get any benefit out of it at all. This is the Buddhist teaching of Paticcasamuppada, is that you have some control of this. You can begin to change your input, you can begin to change the way you process input, you can begin to change the outcome that you manufacture, you can begin to change the way that it touches you, and you can begin to change the way you feel about things. Your choice. And this always happens right here, right now. It's not a kind of a meditation practice to where you sit on the floor for hours and hours and hours putting up with it and doing what you're told to do, and then you get your reward 5, 10, or 20 years later. Oh no, when you change the way that you think right here, right now, you get the benefit of that right here, right now. That's it. So let's have some comments. Let's open this up. Daniel, what do you think? Sorry, I was muted, but, uh, yeah, I've heard you talk about this before.

**Speaker C:** But it was good to hear it again.

**Speaker A:** And yeah, I guess there's not much.

**Speaker C:** To disagree with, I guess.

**Speaker A:** All right. Well, how about you, Rick? Did this answer your question?

**Speaker D:** Yes. It's quite an elaborate answer, but I like that.

**Speaker B:** I.

**Speaker D:** Feel like I have a better understanding of it now. So it's basically the steps that lead.

**Speaker C:** To.

**Speaker D:** I guess, dissatisfaction. And that's the— You create it. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And then at any moment in time, you can just stop creating it in the moment. That's kind of like the whole practice, right?

**Speaker A:** Is.

**Speaker D:** It like the constant creation of it?

**Speaker A:** It's constant. Okay, we're constantly manufacturing. That's called thinking. The question is, are we thinking about the input? Are we analyzing the input that we've got? Are we already deciding that we know?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. Most of the time you already know. Like the judgment is made before—.

**Speaker A:** We live in all— we don't have any choice over our judgments, we've already made them. Instead of beginning to say, oh, let's take a new moment, let's look again, let's get new data over and over again. The more new data we get, then the more we rely upon new data to give us up-to-date manufactured reality rather than always manufacturing something right now that is mostly old.

**Speaker D:** So it's just also kind of like about being in the moment, right?

**Speaker A:** Precisely. That's what being in the moment means, is being in our senses. Let's take in new data. And being in the past means we're digging up stuff out of the past to try to understand the present moment, whether it's much better just to take in new data about the present moment. Be here now, taking in data, is much better than thinking that we already know what it's like right now. Back to the story about stumbling or stubbing our toe on the way to the bathroom late at night. Let's look at where we're going right now rather than thinking that we know the way already.

**Speaker D:** But sometimes it's also useful, right? Like if you want to do something complicated, like you kind of need to build on something old to do something new.

**Speaker A:** If you do something wisely though, that's the whole point, is be careful about how you're doing this. Because the scientist, for instance, can get really pissed off when his experiment doesn't go the way that he wanted it to. Because he's not experimenting in the present moment, his experiment is based upon some past experiment. Anicca. And you know, that's her— that's been called the definition of insanity, and it's often blamed on Einstein, is doing the same thing over and over again expecting new results. Well, let's stop doing the same thing over and over again. Let's do something new based upon new data. Okay. Okay, so Amrit, how are you?

**Speaker E:** Yes, very good, Dhammarato.

**Speaker C:** I have one question about this, the.

**Speaker E:** Whole process you describe, and I guess you're talking about that during a perception.

**Speaker C:** Phase, so hindrances enters during The perception phase, right?

**Speaker A:** When we are— precisely, they enter and then they get full-blown in the movie that we've made, that we get. They wind up in hindrances rather than in a pleasant situation. So the hindrances then is what contacts us. But where did those hindrances come from? We stored them away. We've got them there ready to pop out.

**Speaker E:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** So instead of Manu, instead of manufacturing something new right now, we manufacture something just based upon the old hindrances of the things that we wanted, or our old doubts, our old worries. It's hard to have a new worry. All the stuff that we worry about is old stuff. So you have a choice. Are you going to manufacture stuff with new data, or are you going to manufacture it with the old stuff? So, Marcus, what do you think?

**Speaker B:** This has been really nice, actually. I recently came across a pretty good example as well about perception and how it's based on memory. So there was this person who had like a congenital cataract, so because of that he was blind from birth. And then at some point they did an operation so he could, you know, gain vision. And then he was asked like, okay, well, what are you seeing? And he had no idea. He, he didn't understand anything he was seeing. And so, yeah, they brought him to the zoo to like see an elephant, and he, he didn't understand how it was supposed to look to understand that there's like an elephant there. Like nothing made sense to him.

**Speaker A:** Ah, but if you keep taking him back to the zoo and let him see that elephant newly over and over again he will begin to construct what elephants are. And then he'll know elephants, and then he runs across an elephant that don't look like the ones in the zoo, but he'll respond to that new elephant the way that he responded to the ones that he had built up by going to the zoo to see elephants. And the elephants in the wild are not the same as the elephants in the zoo. So Anna, what did you get out of today's talk? I'm really glad to see you, by the way.

**Speaker E:** Yes, I'm really glad to see you all as well.

**Speaker A:** Very glad.

**Speaker E:** It's been a long time. Yeah, I found your interpretation really pragmatic.

**Speaker A:** And.

**Speaker E:** Really helpful in the day-to-day life, you know. Like, yeah, it's very different from what we used to learn, I think, and especially the translation of the word, you know, like pa��ā. I mean, it really makes sense.

**Speaker A:** It does, and it makes even more sense when you begin to see it in your own life. So I would highly recommend that you remember this and start seeing how your mind actually operates. That's one of the things about the Paticcasamuppada is that it's not necessarily dependent origination and something foreign and whatnot like that. This is actually teaching of how your mind works.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And how you wind up in Dukkha. How you wind up being dissatisfied. Go ahead.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I think it's really interesting when you, like, for people who have traumas, like, it really makes sense because, like, the traumas actually color their view of life.

**Speaker A:** Every moment, moment by moment. It's not the life it colors, it's this moment that it colors. Yeah, yeah. And it colors it again, and then it colors it again.

**Speaker E:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Moment by moment.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly, exactly. And so their perception of life can be completely biased because of what they've been through in the past. And Like if they knew Paticcasamuppada, it would be good for them because they could understand that the present moment is not always the same as the past. Even if you have suffered in the past, it doesn't mean that you have to suffer in the present.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. But we get into the habit of suffering and so we continue to suffer, not recognizing we've got a choice.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, but it's probably harder for people who have big traumas, you know.

**Speaker A:** Uh, actually, I would disagree with that a little bit in the sense that, no, the people who don't have trouble getting this are those who don't practice because they don't see the possible benefit. It is quite possible that someone who has heavy traumas over time, and you know, they have what they call post-traumatic stress. Mm-hmm. If they can see that, oh, I don't have to stress, then they would be really eager to practice and they would get great benefit out of it. It would be something like hot coffee gets cold faster than warm coffee.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, absolutely.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And so if you've got a life that's full of suffering and you really want out of it, if you hit rock bottom that may give you the redoubling of the effort that's needed to actually keep doing it and keep doing it.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so don't say, oh, poor me, I've had such terrible traumas that I can't get out of my stuff. Oh no, you can say, all my troubles and my trauma have been big enough that hot dog, I'm going to do something about it.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And I think Pedro right now is going through this. He knows exactly what I'm talking about. Is that right, Pedro? Oh yes, totally, definitely.

**Speaker F:** And I see, uh, as you talk, but I, I think also that I will keep seeing that, that this.

**Speaker C:** Uh.

**Speaker F:** Um, you know conditioned consciousness versus raw input in my mind. As you talked, I was looking this into my mind, and I think I can keep looking a bit. And yes, like every you talk is a great reminder for reality, because like for the mind, as you speak, is like a bit of shock. So that I come back to listening and so on. But I hope I don't need so much shock to become present. I hope I will need less and less to be here now and to remind myself that I can be receiving input here and now.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. I am actually I'm so happy and thrilled that so many of you are getting good benefit out of the Dharma, that you're taking what I'm saying, you're practicing, and you can see for yourself that this is of enormous value, that you have a choice in your life, that you're not stuck. And oftentimes that's exactly what we need to do, is we need to recognize how much we do suffer because that'll give us the energy and the effort to go do something about it, to come out of it. People who suffer on a little bit are almost doomed to stay in it because it's good enough. Let me just plot on and suffer on. But those of us who hit rock bottom occasionally, we say, 'Hot dog, I'm going to do something about this.' So, Cat, how are you? I'm good. You're good, huh? All right.

**Speaker C:** Well, I have a question actually. I was going to ask, what is the best way to see dependent origination happening? What is the the most skillful way to see this whole thing happening up close?

**Speaker A:** Okay, I would say offhand that one of the things that we can start paying attention to is that I made this up. I made this up. I made this reality. Back to the story of I made up that white fiberglass, uh, French horn. And I made that white fiberglass French horn out of a Frisbee and a pair of sneakers. And when we recognize that we're manufacturing our reality, that gives us a choice. Oh well, I don't have to manufacture it like that. I can manufacture it a different way. I've got a choice here about the way that I think. Can you remember that? Do you— can you remember that you've got a choice about the way that you think?

**Speaker C:** Actually, I asked you this a while ago. I just can't put it together in my head. I can't remember, but I remember asking you about something with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa about staying at the point of contact that you can do that, except only you can only do that if you're able to cut out background thoughts.

**Speaker A:** No, the background thoughts are actually that salyatana that does impact us. Can you see that your background thoughts— and they're not really background, they're just things that come up. There's no such thing as a background. It's just when you think those thoughts that you call the background, there they are right in front of you. And then you go back to thinking of something else that you used to call the foreground, but now that was the background. No, whatever is there, that— they're not really background when they're happening. That we are always in the present moment when our thoughts— are you aware of the thoughts, or do you buy them? Do you believe your thoughts? Don't believe the way you think. Let me investigate again. Let me look again. Let me check this out again. That was especially true— there's an old story about it, and that is, is that right now I'm doing stuff on the computer, uh, writing PHP code. But I remember in the old days when we did mainframes that the students only got 1 or 2 runs a week, because there were so many students, they'd put in all their punch cards. But I had an in, because I'd had work for IBM, and I already knew all the staff in that computer room when I was a student there. And so, I could get a lot of runs in; I did really excellent stuff, not because I was better than the other students, but because I had access, that I could try things, and try things, and try things. But basically, you gotta look at what you're doing, check it out, and then put it to the test. And that's one of the problems with the coders nowadays, is they'll just do anything and then test it, and then do something else and test it, rather than actually investigate and look. And so this is what we need to do, is to recognize that the thoughts that you have are not really yours. It was stuff that you borrowed years ago, and you keep having the same thoughts over and over again without even recognizing they're not mine. These are not my thoughts, and I'm really glad that I started borrowing thoughts that were better— borrowing thoughts from Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and borrowing thoughts from Achan Po rather than remembering and borrowing stuff from my dad. So that's the way, is to remember to look at what you're thinking. Remember to look at that stuff. Then you have a choice. Are you going to continue to think that way, or are you going to think something new? It's an easy concept. The question is, can you remember to do it? Can you remember to investigate your thoughts to figure out, is this thing wholesome that I'm thinking now, or can I do better than this? Am I going to be stuck with the same old movies that I manufacture, or can I make some new movies? Make some new movies based Can I.

**Speaker C:** Read out a message you sent me like a while ago? So my question is, is Nibbana just you are at the point of raw sensory input, the point of contact, and no rebirth happens? Are you just in a total flow of reality without disliking or liking? And your reply was, yes and yes, do it, it's not hard. If you can stop the background noise of the mind. So that was, that was your reply.

**Speaker A:** I bet I didn't use the background, I just used the noise of the mind.

**Speaker C:** Well, you said background.

**Speaker A:** I did. Okay, I, I could use those words. So that's the way that we can see, is, is that You've got a choice about the thoughts that you're having right now, rather than just being merely impacted by them and then having all of these feelings about it. You've got a choice. Wake up to the manufacturing process. Wake up to the movies that you make and recognize, oh, let me go get some new input. Let's go shoot some more film. Let's go get some new data. Let's look again, investigate, analyze. Then we can come up with something useful and worthwhile. So guys, thank you so much. This has been a really delightful talk. I've enjoyed it. Anybody got any last words? I see smiles. I see smiles. I see everybody smiling. Even Cat's smiling. Thank you very much, guys. I appreciate it.

**Speaker D:** Thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Thank you, Dhammarato. We'll see you later.

**Speaker E:** See ya.

**Speaker B:** Bye.

**Speaker F:** Bye-bye, bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** See you guys.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A), is a practical and accessible exploration of **Dependent Origination (Paticcasamuppada)**, framed as the detailed mechanism behind the Second Noble Truth (the cause of *dukkha*, or dissatisfaction).

Here is a summary of the key points:

### Core Thesis
Dependent Origination is not a mystical or philosophical theory, but a **practical description of how the mind works** to create suffering. It's the step-by-step process by which ignorance leads to manufactured suffering.

### The Central Analogy: Ignorance as Not Paying Attention
The entire process begins with **ignorance (avijja)**, which Dhammarato defines as **not paying attention** or assuming we already know.
*   **Key Example:** Stubbing your toe in the dark because you assume you know the way to the bathroom. Suffering arises from not "turning on the light" (i.e., not being mindful and investigating the present moment).

### The Process of Manufacturing Suffering
Dhammarato walks through the links of Dependent Origination in a modern, psychological way:

1.  **Ignorance (Avijja):** The root. We start life ignorant, make rules and decisions as children ("I must get A's," "I must keep up with my dad"), and then live by those unexamined rules.

2.  **Mental Formations (Sankhara):** The "big pile" of these past rules, shoulds, and conditioning.

3.  **Consciousness (Viññāṇa):** Raw sensory input (shapes, sounds). He demystifies this, saying even a tree or a light switch has a basic form of "consciousness" (reactivity).

4.  **Mind & Matter / Perception (Nāmarūpa):** This is where the **manufacturing begins**. The mind takes raw input and **interprets it through the old database (Sankhara)**.
    *   **Key Example:** Mistaking a white Frisbee and shoes for a white French horn because of his past with a white sousaphone. We **construct our reality** from past impressions.

5.  **The Six Sense Bases (Saḷāyatana):** Not just the physical senses, but the **manufactured sensory experience**—our internal "movie" built from memory.

6.  **Contact (Phassa):** The crucial insight: **We are not contacted by reality, but by our manufactured movie.** What "gets our goat" is our own creation, not the event itself (e.g., a teenager reacting to an image of "dad" built from past conflicts).

7.  **Feeling (Vedanā):** Feelings (liking/disliking) arise from that manufactured contact. They are not inevitable; they are based on our ignorant processing.

8.  **Craving (Taṇhā) & Clinging (Upādāna):** Ignorant feelings lead to ignorant craving ("I must have what I like") and then solidify into rigid rules and judgments ("This is good, that is bad").

9.  **Becoming (Bhava) & Suffering (Dukkha):** This clinging births (*bhava*) the "woeful states" or realms of suffering: the **hell** of anger, the **hungry ghost** state of endless wanting, the **animal** state of dumbly following rules without reward, and the **titan** state of anxiety and territoriality.

### The Path to Freedom: The Practical Solution
The talk emphasizes that this process is **not deterministic**. We have **agency at every step**:
*   **The Solution is in the Present Moment:** Break the chain by **"turning on the light"**—paying attention to **raw sensory input *here and now*** instead of relying on the old, faulty database.
*   **You Have a Choice:** Recognize you are **manufacturing your reality**. You can choose to investigate anew, gather fresh data, and thus create a new, more wholesome "movie."
*   **The Result is Immediate:** This isn't about years of meditation for a future reward. When you change your perception **now**, you change your feeling **now**. You can choose to feel good by wanting what you can have, rather than suffering over what you can't.
*   **Connection to Practice:** This is the essence of **Right View** and **Mindfulness (Anapanasati)**—continuously observing to prevent ignorant processing.

### Conclusion
Dhammarato reframes Dependent Origination as an empowering, real-time map of the mind. Suffering is a **habit of ignorant manufacturing**. The end of suffering comes from **waking up to this process** and choosing, moment-by-moment, to be present with reality as it is, thereby stopping the creation of your own dissatisfaction. The talk ends with participants affirming how this pragmatic understanding helps in daily life, especially in working with traumatic patterns.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain the abstract Buddhist concept of *Paticcasamuppada* (Dependent Origination) and related ideas. Here is a breakdown:

### **Key Metaphors**

1.  **The Stubbed Toe / Walking in the Dark:** This is the central, recurring metaphor.
    *   **Meaning:** It illustrates **ignorance** (*avijjā*). We think we "know" the way to the bathroom in the dark (we have a concept/memory), so we don't turn on the light (we don't pay fresh attention). The resulting stubbed toe is the *dukkha* (suffering/dissatisfaction) that arises from that ignorance.
    *   **Extended:** The speaker connects this to distracted driving—thinking you "know" the road leads to not paying attention and crashing.

2.  **The Movie & The Cutting Room Floor:**
    *   **Meaning:** Our perception is like **editing raw film footage**. Our mind takes sensory "raw footage" (consciousness) and edits it based on past memories and biases (the "cutting room floor" of *saṅkhāra*). The final "movie" (*saḷāyatana*) we experience is a manufactured reality, not the direct sensory input.

3.  **The Database / OCR Software:**
    *   **Meaning:** The mind's **perception** (*saññā*) works like Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or voice recognition software. It takes raw sensory data (pixels of text, sound waves) and runs it against a stored database of past experiences (*saṅkhāra*) to produce a recognized "text" or interpretation. This process can be faulty if the database is built on ignorance.

4.  **The Pile of Stuff (vs. a Library):**
    *   **Meaning:** Our stored memories, rules, and conditioning (*saṅkhāra*) are not an organized, logical library. They are a **disorganized pile**. We never know which old, ignorant rule or memory will surface next to color our present perception.

5.  **The Light Switch & The Tree:**
    *   **Meaning:** Used to demystify **consciousness** (*viññāṇa*). At its basic level, consciousness is simply responsiveness, like a light switch "knowing" to complete a circuit when flipped, or a tree "knowing" to bend toward the light. It's a natural process, not something mystical.

6.  **The Hungry Ghost (*Preta*) & The Draft Animal:**
    *   **Meaning:** These describe **woeful states of being** resulting from ignorant craving (*taṇhā*) and clinging (*upādāna*).
    *   **Hungry Ghost:** A being with a huge stomach and a tiny throat—always craving but never satisfied. This represents insatiable wanting.
    *   **Draft Animal:** The donkey walking in a circle at the mill, or the horse plowing its own pasture. It does the work but gets none of the reward (the juice, the vegetables). This represents living life rule-bound, doing what one "should" do without finding genuine satisfaction.

### **Key Stories & Analogies**

1.  **The White French Horn:** A personal story where the speaker, from a distance, saw a white Frisbee and white sneakers but **perceived them as a white fiberglass French horn** (based on his past experience with a white sousaphone). This perfectly illustrates how the mind constructs reality (*nāmarūpa*) from sensory input based on past data.

2.  **Adam and Eve (Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's interpretation):**
    *   **Meaning:** The "Fall" is not about sex or disobedience, but about **eating the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil**—i.e., **judgment**. Paradise is lost when we start labeling experiences as "good" or "bad" based on our likes/dislikes, rather than experiencing reality as it is. Judgment destroys our present-moment "paradise."

3.  **Trying to Keep Up With Dad:** A personal story about adopting an anxious, hurried pace in life based on an ignorant childhood decision ("I must keep up with my fast-walking father"). This shows how *saṅkhāra* (conditioning) is built from early, ignorant decisions and creates lasting *dukkha* (anxiety).

4.  **The Man Born Blind Gaining Sight:** A story (likely referencing the case of Sidney Bradford) used to show that **perception requires learned memory**. A person seeing for the first time has no framework to interpret visual data. This underscores that all our perception is built on learned, and potentially faulty, past constructs.

5.  **The Sports Fan:** The example of two fans watching the same play—one happy, one angry—depending on which team they support. This shows that our **feelings** (*vedanā*) are not caused by the event itself, but by our pre-existing, manufactured allegiance (our "movie").

### **Overall Purpose of the Metaphors and Stories:**
The speaker uses these concrete, often everyday images to make a complex psychological and philosophical teaching practical and relatable. They shift the focus from *Paticcasamuppada* as a cosmic chain to a **user's manual for the mind**, showing how we actively—and often ignorantly—create our own suffering moment-to-moment, and how we can learn to "manufacture" a happier reality by choosing wise attention and letting go of rigid judgments.
