### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Yes, I recorded this after I sat down and I thought, I don't need to. I don't need to bother my ass. I don't need to do long breaths and then short breaths. I don't need to do any procedure. I don't even need to look for the sort of trigger, the feeling inside my head, or to get to the first Jhana. So thinking, a wave of pity came over me and I started to laugh. And this has worked since I've tried it.

**Speaker B:** So finally, I mean, you've been calling for what, 6 months or a year or so like that? And I keep saying the same thing and you keep putting it into your basket of rules and shoulds and to-do list.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** But my answer to that is burn that to-do list and just sit down and be happy instead.

**Speaker A:** Well, yeah, I know that, I know.

**Speaker B:** That, but you put it as a rule. I'm not supposed to put rules in my rule book, and that's a rule that you put down.

**Speaker A:** That's a good one, that's a good one. Yes, um, although Arahant. It's finding all this stuff that I don't know what— no, it's all right. Where is it? The feeling that— yes. It's feeling that you have to think, well, why do I tell myself that the Dukkha should be left alone and the Nirodha is some way wrong? Why, if somebody says cheer up, do I answer fuck off? Because is that me doing my sort of thing like the frog and scorpion swimming over the river? It's what one does. But then I started thinking, I think I'm in danger of giving up this Buddhism stuff because it's no different really from the old Kipling soldier stuff. But then Buddha was around long before the muscular Christian self-help ideas. And I'm thinking here of an a poem by Kipling, it's set, you know, in the Indian Empire, of Britain's Indian Empire, where the soldier is exhorting himself to be thankful you're living and trust to your luck and march to your front like a soldier.

**Speaker B:** All right, but that's the soldier's attitude, marching to the front, because you've got work to do.

**Speaker A:** Yep.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Why can't you, as the soldier, take off that uniform, sit down and go to sleep? Why do we have to march to the front? That's the whole point.

**Speaker A:** But the whole point of that line is not to— it's only metaphorically to march to your front because it's not talking about— he was actually talking about leave the past behind and don't let things bother you, because you don't know what's going to happen, you just have to keep on going ahead.

**Speaker B:** Actually, that's why I'm trying to make a correction for you, that what you just said is wrong. Getting up out the past is true, but then marching into the future is not, that's just turning around and marching and going in the wrong direction. There's a middle place in there, and that is to stop dealing with the past and also stop marching forward into the future and just sit down and enjoy the moment.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh.

**Speaker B:** Well, yes, the past is all about dissatisfaction, and the future is all about the supposed to, shoulds, ideals, way things ought to be. And that's where all the work comes from. We do all of that for the future because we're dissatisfied with the past. If we would drop the past completely, then we can also drop the future completely. There's no place to go, there's nothing to do next. I have students ask that often, and that is, "Now that I've got to Jhana, what do I do next?" The answer is, you don't have Jhana because you're asking the question, "What do I do next?" When you're in the Jhana, it's good enough. This is it. There's no place to go after this. The question, can I stay in this state or am I going to go back into the past and future?

**Speaker A:** You actually don't need to get into the Jhana for it to be good.

**Speaker B:** Like, well, well, Jhanas are a broad kind of thing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Well, that's what I got the other day when I sort of— when I sat down and thought, I don't have to do anything. And there it was. There I was.

**Speaker B:** Here we are.

**Speaker A:** There we are.

**Speaker B:** Can you do that again? You're talking about it now. Can you do it again now?

**Speaker A:** All right, I'll do it again though.

**Speaker B:** Wow, no place to go, nothing to do, everything's just fine. Life is sweet when we stop biting. Everything is just okay.

**Speaker A:** I know. And that there is a sort of immediate—.

**Speaker B:** Pulling yourself back out of it. I could see you going into Jhana, and now the mind starts up and you're starting to talk again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's why I'm trying to tell you about it, because I'm coming out of it to tell you about it, of course.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you don't have to tell me about it. You could just stay there. It's okay with me if you're having a pleasant moment. Can you maintain it? You don't have to come out of it to explain. Um, don't have to worry about it or have doubts or what do I do next or any of that kind of stuff. You say right now, just good.

**Speaker A:** Right now, the sort of Glee, sense of glee and excitement is there.

**Speaker B:** And wow, I can do this. Is that what your excitement is? Yeah, I can do this. I can sit here and do nothing. That's wonderful that I can do something new, nothing at all.

**Speaker A:** I can do this and I can do this. I can do this several times a day. I know that.

**Speaker B:** Can you do it several hours a day? Not from all— Do it down? —minutes at a time. Yeah, so why do you have to come back to the hindrances? Why can't you just stay there?

**Speaker A:** Because I've got a brain and a.

**Speaker B:** Mind that— That is restless, I know, I got it.

**Speaker A:** That needs more than More than just—.

**Speaker B:** It doesn't need, it's just in the habit of.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but you know, it's see the little moron, he doesn't give a damn. I wish I were a moron, my God, perhaps I am. You know what you— we, yes, well—.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so why don't we practice being a moron for a while? We've been told you can't be a moron, you're not supposed to be a moron, but in fact being a moron is wonderful until the moron thinks he needs to do something.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** And the best part about a moron is that he doesn't have to do anything at all. He's too stupid to get caught up in the intellectual activities of the world. So in a way, the Buddha has a teaching that we can express as Dukkha and stupidity. Let's be stupid. Let's be too stupid to do anything, so that we can stop getting ourselves into trouble.

**Speaker A:** This is interesting because I have managed to keep this feeling up while making my tea and sitting around and typing on the computer. When I've finished actually sitting and sort of going into the state, I've not managed previously to do it talking to anybody. So that's good. That's good.

**Speaker B:** That's a new skill to learn, but it's based upon the skill of being able to sit and do nothing and be really pleasant.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. Right.

**Speaker B:** And then when you're talking to somebody, you can say, hey, I'll at least listen. That's all I owe them. And so we listen to what somebody has to say because that's input. That's just reality.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** If they're not there talking to us, then there's the wall behind them, and that's the reality. Just whatever is real. But if somebody comes to talk to you, let them talk, and you can just stay in that pleasant state. But if you open your mouth and start arguing with them or talking to them, more than likely you're going to lose it. But never mind, go practice again. Everything that's worthwhile like this requires practice. To practice to come out and stay out of those hindrances, those pesky hindrances.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** And are you still in your state of happiness, or did you get into a state of confusion right then? You could come back. Let's practice again. Let's just keep coming back to, I'm okay right now, I don't have anything to do or anything to go. That's what we need to practice.

**Speaker A:** But I can't have a sensible discussion with you if I can't sort of express the doubts that rise up.

**Speaker B:** Okay, but that's a rule that we got to have a sensible discussion. And I've got a different rule, and that is that I can watch you so that I can see when you're going in and out of the states of happiness and whether you're getting into states of confusion and wanting to talk.

**Speaker A:** So this is presumably how the guys figured out what state the Buddha was in when he was about to die and he went through the various, various Jhanas and back again.

**Speaker B:** Well, we don't know that for sure. All we know is that's what somebody wrote down, which is actually quite poetic.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker B:** But Westerners read poetry and think that they're reading prose. The fact is, is he's laying there and enjoying the fact that he's dying, because remember, the Jhana states are associated with great pleasure.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, yes.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so if he's going in and out of the jhanas as he's about to die, within the next 3 minutes he's dead, why not enjoy watching the process happen? Most people flip out, oh, I'm dying.

**Speaker A:** Grant, I should think so. Well, dear, I've just been listening to a great load of stuff about this because My son's mother-in-law has a sister who has just died, and it was all drama in the hospital and so on. And I have a cousin who is currently very ill and probably won't last the next 6 months. So there's a lot of it about anyway.

**Speaker B:** Well, think about it like this, experience it like this, go through what we would call the thought experiment, the thought experiment like Einstein was talking about. And that is, think about, well, what would it be like if I were dying and would be dead in the next 3 minutes? How am I going to handle that? Am I going to handle it with great pleasure? Oh, finally I'm out of here. Goodbye, folks. Goodbye, cruel world. I'm out of here. Wow, finally I'm out. Oh, how it feels so good. Now I can finally, finally, finally relax.

**Speaker A:** You mean you don't have to think about what's going to happen next?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you don't have to happen to think about. There may be never next. There'll never be a next. Right now is the last of it.

**Speaker A:** This is it.

**Speaker B:** Well, in Buddhism, you probably heard, especially from the later literature, that the last mind moment, what you're thinking about as you're dying, is the full culmination of your existence. If you don't want to die, you're in pain and suffering as you die. You're not getting what you want. But if you're quite happy that you're dying— right now you're dying, I mean, next 3 minutes you're dead— can't we enjoy that? Can't you get great pleasure out of, wow, this is it, this is all there is? Have a really, really good last moment, a happy one. That's what we were talking about in the sense that the Buddha can go through the Jhanas, in and out of them, right as he's dying. What a way to go! Let's all die like a Buddha!

**Speaker A:** He's going to be out of luck if he actually goes over at the moment when he's come out of a jhana.

**Speaker B:** Anyway, well, I don't think that it says that he comes out of the jhana because one of the hallmarks of coming out of jhana is back into hindrances. Yeah, hindrances re-arising. So I don't see in that in the— by the way, the word you're quoting is out of the Mahasatipatthana Sutta number 16 of the Dhammarato. And in there it does not say that he came out of the jhanas altogether. No, but they're going up and down through the first, through the, uh, fourth jhana. Now they're in the first jhana. One obviously can speak because we can think, but in that regard we're still thinking very pleasant thoughts, just like I'm talking about. Wow, what a nice way to go out. Wow, this is the end of it all. Goodbye, cruel world. Hahaha. That's all could be done from within the first jhana. But ouch! Oh, I'm dying! That's hindrance.

**Speaker A:** Yes, there is the actual maintaining the happy feeling. It makes it— well, yes, maintaining the happy feeling makes it quite difficult to talk. It's not, um, it's not that easy.

**Speaker B:** So when you're happy feeling, it's a skill then to learn to talk while you're still having that happy feeling. That's a skill to be developed.

**Speaker A:** And I'm trying to do it at the moment, and it's like falling. It's like the bicycle is wobbling, you know.

**Speaker B:** All right. Yep, exactly. All right, so in the sense of that, the reason that the bicycle is wobbling is often because the kid who was pedaling the bicycle is in too much of a hurry. Yeah, okay, so stop being in a hurry and start paying attention to staying upright and balanced, and then the kid can balance the bike.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, if he goes too slow, he's going to fall fall off too.

**Speaker B:** Ah, it depends upon your awareness. Yes, you could. In fact, in fact, every motorcyclist and every bicyclist who stops at a stop sign, he doesn't fall over because he's got the sense of awareness to put his foot down for the balance. And here you are wobbling, and perhaps the best thing to do is to get yourself balanced instead of wobbling. Stop and balance. Now in that regard, that means that when you're dealing with other people and their hindrances or coming out of the Jhana, we need to stop and rebalance. Because almost always a Dhamma dude, when he's out in the world, he's talking to people who are talking from their hindrances, inviting him back into his hindrances too.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well.

**Speaker B:** And so the easy way out is to just stop and balance.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** You don't have to travel down, wobbling down the talky-talky-talky trail that everybody wants to call to walk down. That's almost a rule. We've got to interchange, we've got to talk. We can't just sit here on the Skype and enjoy each other's company. Anagami happily. No, we got to talk at each other.

**Speaker A:** There are, yes, there's a lot of that about. There's a lot of people, I mean, who feel that they have to keep talking and interchange and interact with other people that they're with all the time.

**Speaker B:** And you got to come up with something even if it's really stupid.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Oh yes. Oh yes.

**Speaker B:** Or a better way of saying it is, even though that is a hindrance to pleasure.

**Speaker A:** Well, yes.

**Speaker B:** Just like being full of doubt or having questions is not pleasurable.

**Speaker A:** Isn't it? Isn't it? I mean, sort of thinking of all the alternatives and all the possibilities, you.

**Speaker B:** Know, that— well, that doesn't have to be doubt. Doubt has the quality of needing to have an answer rather than just happily speculating.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay. But I mean, one of the doubts that comes up, as I've said, it's like this sort of muscular Christianity. I mean, all you're, you know, in a sense, all you're doing is saying, cheer up. And they did that and killed all the people.

**Speaker B:** No, no. What happened is the story is, is somebody's morose and unhappy and the guy comes by and he says, cheer up, things could be worse. And he says, I cheer up, right? And I cheered up, and sure enough, things got worse. Okay, well, when things got worse, what do you do? You cheer up again. The fact is that cheering up is only a very, very small part of the whole lot of troubles before the cheering up and the whole lot of troubles after the cheering up. But if you can cheer up and cheer up and cheer up and cheer up and cheer up, then there is no disaster afterwards. It's just more cheering up. And you cheer up, then you cheer up again, then you break a deep breath and cheer up again. So yeah, all of the good stuff is there, we know it, we just don't practice it, we just don't keep repeating it and repeating it and repeating it. And that's the real issue of the teaching of the Dhamma. Of the Buddha is not that we get a good feeling for a moment and that's it. It's that we can get that good feeling, get another good feeling, get another good feeling, go back to the first one having that good feeling, and keep in good feelings, keep cheering, keep cheering, keep cheering. Not asking questions about how do you cheer up, just doing it. Not bragging about how good you can get cheered up, just go back and get cheered up.

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm. Yes.

**Speaker B:** So yeah, all that exists, all of that good advice that you've heard is correct. It's just not repeated. But that's the important part, is all of that good stuff you mentioned about self-help books. The reason that people don't get anything out of a self-help book is after they stop reading the book, they put it on the shelf. And now they're not helping themselves. You should see that you read it in the book and self-help, and then self-help again, and then self-help again, and stay on page 4 of the book. You don't ever need the rest of the book. All you need to read is page 4. It says cheer up, and then I cheer up. Then I read page 4 again, cheer up, and I cheer up again. And I read page 4 again, it says cheer up, and I cheer up again. And that's all there is to it. There is nothing more than that. That's the entire teaching of the Buddha. Can you come back and cheer up again, and come back and cheer up again, and come back, and when Dukkha comes, never mind, come back and cheer up? Or as Brian said, even when he's being crucified, always look on the bright side of life. So even though somebody's trying to scar your hands with nails, you can still cheer up.

**Speaker A:** You're going to be able to do it pretty powerfully by then.

**Speaker B:** Right, exactly. That's the whole point. If we practice it, we get really good at it, cheering up, cheering up, cheering up. They can't keep me from being cheerful.

**Speaker A:** You see, you are by making me sort of cheer up— well, not making.

**Speaker B:** Me— I'm giving you the opportunity. I keep reminding you, I'm reminding you, cheer up, cheer up. That's what a good teacher does, is remind a student to do what they've already been taught to do.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I think you've— yes, right. Well, this is.

**Speaker B:** This is the same old thing. Can you cheer up? It's a very simple process. It just has to be repeated over and over and over again. And you're talking about all the times that you're not repeating it. And I'm saying, never mind about all of that stuff. Just repeat. Rinse out the mind and repeat. The entire teachings of the Buddha is on the back of every shampoo bottle. All you have to do is rinse and repeat. Rants and repeats.

**Speaker A:** But if the entire teachings of the Buddha can be written on the back of a shampoo bottle, what are we doing with all these suttas?

**Speaker B:** Well, there's two reasons for it. One is teaching or talking about how good they feel. And the other one is, are you sure? Please tell me how to be happy. Please tell me how to cheer up. Please tell me how to clean my mind. And that's where most of the literature, most Buddhist literature is written out of a mind of doubt.

**Speaker A:** Well, it would have to be, wouldn't it, really? It would have to be, because if you got it, you don't need to explain it.

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** But although, mind you, if you got it, you'll want to spread it, of course, as well as explaining it.

**Speaker B:** Right, that's why I said that there's two ways. One is to actually spread the joy, and the other one is to keep asking, how do I get it, how do I get it? And the answer to that that and stop asking how to get it and just enjoy.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** It'S that simple. It really is that very simple.

**Speaker A:** Yes, man, this is, this is actually Yeah, well, this is interesting. Well, this is interesting because this is the first time I've actually been able to generate or try to generate these thoughts in the presence of somebody else.

**Speaker B:** And it's better to do it in front of a noble. It's better to do it in front of somebody who's cheered up too. It's really hard to do it when Granny is on her deathbed and you can't go in and cheer her up, or me either. Yeah, yeah, unless she's already close to being a Buddha, and then you can cheer her up and say, yeah, you're right, grandson, I'm ready to go, check me out.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker B:** So can you, can you keep remembering? Never mind, just enjoy this moment. And enjoy this one too. And enjoy that sip of coffee. Just take the flavor of it and experience it.

**Speaker A:** It's actually called tea, called black tea.

**Speaker B:** Which is something you— I don't care what you call it, can you enjoy it? And you taste it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, sure.

**Speaker B:** That's the point. It doesn't matter what you call it. The question is, is it good enough?

**Speaker A:** Well, if it's proper coffee, it's good enough. If it's instant coffee, it's not.

**Speaker B:** Well, you're making judgments now rather than saying, yeah, I can enjoy what I drink.

**Speaker A:** You can enjoy instant coffee.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you can enjoy instant coffee. Yeah, it's not the same thing as you had, but it'll do. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, never mind, start again. There's nothing to do and no place to go. Just clean out the mind and then repeat. Clean out the mind and then repeat. Clean it out again. I don't hear you talking now. Go ahead. I hear you.

**Speaker A:** I better stop here.

**Speaker B:** All right, I can stop too.

**Speaker A:** I better stop here. It's been great, and thank you for that. You've taught me something on this occasion. You've possibly even— it's possibly even like the time when the when the Zen master hits you with the stick and you sort of go, ah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right, we'll see you later.

**Speaker A:** I'll see you later. Cheers. Thanks a lot, pal.

**Speaker B:** Okay, we'll see you again, Jerry. Good friend.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) with a student (Speaker A), centers on a core, radical insight: **the direct and effortless cultivation of happiness by letting go of all "shoulds," procedures, and striving.**

Here is a summary of the key points:

**1. The Breakthrough:** The student (A) reports a pivotal moment where he sat down and realized he didn't need to follow any meditation technique, trigger, or procedure to find peace. By simply dropping the effort and the "to-do list," a wave of relief and happiness arose spontaneously.

**2. The Core Instruction:** Dhammarato relentlessly reinforces this point: **"burn that to-do list and just sit down and be happy instead."** He identifies the student's main obstacle as turning even this simple instruction into another rule or item on a spiritual checklist. The goal is to stop *doing* and start *being*.

**3. Freedom from Past and Future:** The discussion uses the metaphor of a soldier marching to the front. Dhammarato corrects the student's interpretation: the path isn't about marching from a bad past toward a better future. True peace is found in **stopping completely**—letting go of the dissatisfied past *and* the idealistic, demanding future. Happiness is found in the present moment where "there's no place to go, nothing to do."

**4. Jhana as Simple, Abundant Happiness:** They redefine "Jhana" not as a hard-earned trance state, but as the natural, pleasant state that appears when the mind stops its compulsive activity. The sign of true Jhana is that it's "good enough"; you don't ask "what's next?" The challenge is learning to **stay** in that contentment.

**5. The Practice is Repetition ("Rinse and Repeat"):** The entire teaching is compared to the instructions on a shampoo bottle: **"Rinse and repeat."** The Dhamma is not about complex theory but the continuous, moment-to-moment practice of "cheering up," returning to a pleasant mind, and cleansing it of hindrances. All the suttas and literature, Dhammarato suggests, largely stem from doubt—asking "how?"—while the answer is simply to *do it* again and again.

**6. Application in Life and Even Death:** The talk explores carrying this "happy feeling" into daily activities (making tea, typing) and social interaction. It culminates in a powerful contemplation on dying: if one can "cheer up" continuously, even the last moments of life can be met with pleasure and relaxation, as exemplified by the Buddha's serene passing.

**7. "Be a Moron":** A provocative suggestion is made: practice being a "moron"—too "stupid" to get caught up in the intellectual planning, worrying, and over-complicating that creates dukkha (suffering). This is a call to innocent, direct experience.

**In essence,** the talk strips away Buddhist complexity and points to the heart of the path: **happiness is always available when we stop striving for it.** The practice is the gentle, persistent art of letting go of mental clutter (past/future, rules, doubts) and returning to the innate okay-ness of the present moment, over and over.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the dialogue, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by the speakers:

### **Metaphors**
1. **The Basket/Rulebook of “Shoulds”**  
   Speaker B describes how Speaker A keeps turning advice into another item in a “basket of rules and shoulds and to-do list.” This metaphor represents the tendency to over-systematize practice, turning freedom into obligation.

2. **Burn the To-Do List**  
   Related to the above, this is a metaphor for letting go of striving, procedures, and self-imposed demands in meditation.

3. **Marching to the Front (Soldier Metaphor)**  
   From the Kipling reference—initially used by Speaker A as a metaphor for perseverance (“leave the past behind and keep going”). Speaker B reinterprets it as unnecessary striving: *“Why can’t you, as the soldier, take off that uniform, sit down and go to sleep?”*

4. **The Frog and the Scorpion**  
   Speaker A references this fable (“It’s what one does”) to illustrate ingrained habits—like automatically resisting encouragement (“why, if somebody says cheer up, do I answer *fuck off*?”).

5. **Bicycle Wobbling**  
   Speaker A describes trying to maintain a happy state while talking as like a bicycle wobbling. Speaker B extends it: wobbling happens when you’re in too much of a hurry; instead, **stop and balance**.

6. **Shampoo Bottle Instructions: “Rinse and Repeat”**  
   Speaker B humorously reduces the Buddha’s teaching to this: rinse out the mind (let go of hindrances) and repeat (return to joy again and again).

7. **Being a Moron**  
   Speaker B playfully suggests that “being a moron” — in the sense of being free from overthinking, intellectualizing, and the need to *do* something — is a blessed state in meditation.

8. **Cheer Up / Look on the Bright Side of Life**  
   Used repeatedly as a metaphor for the essential practice: returning to a joyful state regardless of circumstances, even referencing Monty Python’s crucifixion song.

### **Stories & References**
1. **Kipling’s Poem (Soldier in the Indian Empire)**  
   Speaker A mentions this as an example of “muscular Christianity” or stoic perseverance—initially thinking Buddhism might be similar, but later distinguishing Buddha’s approach as older and different.

2. **The Buddha’s Death (Parinibbāna)**  
   Speaker A references the account of the Buddha passing through jhānas before dying. Speaker B reinterprets it: the Buddha was **enjoying the process of dying** with pleasure, not following a formal procedure.

3. **Monty Python’s “Always Look on the Bright Side of Life”**  
   Speaker B references this song (sung during crucifixion in *Life of Brian*) to illustrate cheering up even in extreme suffering.

4. **Self-Help Books**  
   Speaker B critiques them: people read but don’t **repeat** the essential point (like “cheer up” on page 4). The problem isn’t the advice but lack of persistent application.

5. **Zen Master Hitting with a Stick**  
   Speaker A compares the conversation’s impact to a Zen *keisaku* (awakening blow)—a sudden, jarring insight.

### **Overall Theme of Metaphors**
The metaphors collectively contrast:
- **Striving, doing, following rules** (soldier marching, to-do lists, procedures)
- vs. **Being, allowing, enjoying** (sitting down doing nothing, balancing, rinsing and repeating, being a “moron”).

They emphasize that the core of the practice is not in complex techniques but in repeatedly returning to a joyful, present-moment awareness—and that this simplicity is often missed by overcomplicating it with “shoulds.”
