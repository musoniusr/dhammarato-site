### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, um, there seems to be a buzz or a hum in the microphone, but that— is that on me?

**Speaker B:** I can mute.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I think it's on your side. That's better. When you speak, the hum goes away, so it's clearly on your side. Um, The question that you were having would be, from the frame of reference that you were in now, a young man living in the United States wanting to check out. I went through that actually in the late 1960s when I was working for IBM. I was planning on doing exactly the same thing. I was woefully underplanning even in those days, but it was still a very high bar. I thought that if I could get $5,000 together, that I could retire, I could leave. Now, back in the 1960s, $5,000 was a whole lot more than it is today, but it certainly was not enough for for long-term goals, especially since I didn't even have the information about what I know now, or what you can find out now. Then I was just wanting out. That was actually part of my waking up, if you could call it spiritual. Part of my spiritual awakening was this whole process of Something's got to be better in life than this. That even though I would— how to say it? It was an extraordinarily lucky find. I was extraordinarily lucky. I felt it then, my whole family felt it. That I could get a job with IBM as an engineer. Many of the guys who were working for IBM as customer engineers had degrees. I didn't have a degree. They hired me anyway. I was making more money when I first started working for IBM that was more than my mother and my father's combined salaries. They were both working. My dad was making about $350 a month and my mom was making something about that same amount. I don't remember how much, but I think she was making a little bit more than he was. And here I was coming in at $800 a month.

**Speaker B:** I feel like mine is kind of similar too, in terms of not like— I don't think I'm doubling my mom's, but it was a big deal to get the one I got. Anagami. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so, sitting on top of the world, um, upgrading motorbikes and buying BMW cars and all of that kind of stuff, but I was still recognizing deep down inside that I was missing something, that there was something missing in this. That I had more than almost any of the other kids that graduated from high school, and they were all still stuck in Dillon. That was the funny thing also, is that when I took the job, my mom and dad still lived in Dillon, and IBM posted me in Florence, South Carolina. They hired me to go to Florence, which is the biggest city in northeast South Carolina. Florence is the big main hub there, and Dillon, Darlington, all of those other towns are in that area. So I was actually then less than 30 miles from home where I graduated from high school. So that's why I would know about— here I am after I've gotten out of the Navy gotten the job with IBM, and still my mom and dad are still living in Dillon. And so that's when I began to see that almost all the kids that graduated from high school when I did were either still picking tobacco or owned the farm or had joined their dad's business or something like that. And they had nothing, where I had loads of opportunity, and I could see that. And I was— but I was still recognized, and we are all stuck in something here. There's something wrong with this whole show. And so that's how I began to get into that idea. And so quite naturally, without knowing much of anything about Buddha In fact, I had read Light of Asia by Christmas Humphreys and was not particularly impressed with what I got out of that book, very magical and whatnot like that. And I was already, let us say, for years now being dragged to church by my mom and not being impressed at all with Christianity, either what they taught or who they were or how they behaved. This is racist South Carolina. I could see the racism very strongly. So this part of the story is what got me propelled to go. And so when I had an opportunity, I did. I started studying psychology because I thought that was the way to go. But then I got back into Hinduism, and through that a different way into the practice of the Buddha. But for quite a long time, I lived in— we called it basically just backpacking around, going from one wat to another, one temple to another. That staying in a hotel we could do from, or I would do from time to time, but mostly whenever I would get into a city, the easy thing to do is just to check into whatever wat or temple there was in either India or Thailand. But in fact, I bicycled just to save money. I bicycled from Bangkok to Wat Suan Mokkh, then down to Malaysia and then back to Wat Soan Mok, spending almost every night in a wat. Now the wats got thin as you got into Malaysia, but that— I think there was one or two nights in a hotel, but other than that it was generally one night after another, just, you know, biking all day, getting to some town, and in the afternoon or evening and finding what the local wat was, and then go in and sometimes set up a tent. Sometimes they'd give a room.

**Speaker B:** Wat surfing? What?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, mm-hmm, wat surfing.

**Speaker B:** And did you— scan the part where you ended up leaving— uh, not to cut you off— where you ended up leaving the job or doing the teaching, or is this— how did, how did you end up in in with the time to go to India is a question. How would you schedule that?

**Speaker A:** I don't understand the question.

**Speaker B:** Like you're saying you've jumped from South Carolina and now we're in India. How do we get here?

**Speaker A:** By way of graduate school and Texas and then Michigan and 10 years later.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay.

**Speaker A:** Not 10, but almost.

**Speaker B:** So you took a break from the job and you went to graduate school, is that what you're saying?

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** So you took a break from the job and then you went to graduate school?

**Speaker A:** No, actually I quit IBM to go to get a degree, that I was very much impressed with the software side of it. I was hired in hardware and worked on repair of IBM mainframes and whatnot like that. So I had that side of it. Lots of long stories, interesting stories that can be left. The point I guess that I'm making is that The money itself is not important. The importance is the strong determination that you gotta go, you gotta do it. And also it helps if you have the attitude that you will be successful at this. That you can do this thing. That's more important than the cash. I know people who are actually wealthy who don't use that wealth. They just park it someplace and say, hey, I'm going to go off and visit the world and things like that. They wind up being tourists rather than travelers. There's a whole different mindset. The tourists will go on a tour to a— let us say in Bangkok, they give guided tours to the more famous temples that are tourist attractions. I've never been on one of those tours, but I've certainly been in those temples. But I wouldn't want to do it with a tour. You go where you want to go, you don't go because you're following a crowd of people that paid the same money that you paid to listen to the same song that somebody has been singing every day for years. So that part of it then is a different mentality of beginning to get out of the Western mentality completely, as if you were now no longer a resident. You're always Anicca, a visitor. Wherever you go and whatever you do, you have both the quality of feeling very much at home and also very much uninvolved with, as if you were a guest, in any of the politics of the locals. And so we begin to change that style of mentality. And you're right about the four requisites, that in fact the tent on the back of the bicycle is just enough housing.

**Speaker B:** I've never been camping before. This could be an issue. I'm a city, city boy through and through. This could be a problem.

**Speaker A:** No, that's not a problem. The problem is the fear, the fear of the unknown. You've not done it before, and because you haven't done it before, you're not sure if you can do it. I'm sure you can do it. You'd be better off than I was.

**Speaker B:** Why do you think that?

**Speaker A:** Uh, because you've got a whole lot better foundation of knowledge and guidance, and you've heard my stories, and,

**Speaker B:** uh, uh,

**Speaker A:** don't make some of the same mistakes I make, kind of thing. So, um, and I can point you in, in a lot of different directions., within the world of, uh, low

**Speaker B:** rent.

**Speaker A:** Okay, but I've, I've toured the United States in a 1976 Dodge van, for one thing. I just talked with Eric about that because he's out on, uh, roundabout too. He's now in Prescott, Arizona. I just talked to him.

**Speaker B:** Wow.

**Speaker A:** And so he's out, he's out doing it. He's been to Mexico and spent Uh, I think he's probably going to go back to either that or, uh, Wat Atamayata when he gets back to Seattle.

**Speaker B:** Wat Atamayata, that exists?

**Speaker A:** That exists, right? Actually, the whole name of the wat is Wat Atamayata Rama.

**Speaker B:** Okay, that's a very good name, but

**Speaker A:** they just call it Wat Atam. Achan Reek is there. Rith.

**Speaker B:** Ajahn Rith.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Now, why they get that name out of the— uh, they don't. In fact, they get the English out of the Thai, and the English winds up being very strange with an R-I-T-T-H-I is how they get it into the English. But his name is pronounced Ajahn Rith. With a rising tone. Right, like Tony the Tiger says, they're great. Okay, so yeah, Ajahn Rit is there. Um, he's a big fan of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. There's a lot of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa in the United States in these various ones.

**Speaker B:** I was going to say Atamayata sounds very Bhikkhuni.

**Speaker A:** Sure does. Well, uh, uh, Wat Buddhadhamma in Hinsdale, or whatever, West something, they've got the name of it changed. I don't think that they changed location, they just probably changed the address for some reason or another. I've already sent that to you one time.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you did.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And, uh, and also

**Speaker B:** Alan, uh, he

**Speaker A:** spoke But I don't know who's there now. Alan showed me, uh, that there was a scandal, gosh, 15 years ago or something, and that's about the only thing that's left on the internet is some scandal. Some lady didn't like what the monks were doing. I think she was a Western woman who was married to a Thai, and she just did not understand how things operated, and so she got into court, set battle in court suits. I don't know any of the details about it, uh, but I do know that that's long, long ago

**Speaker B:** history.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So if you run across any things like that, it's no longer a scandal, never was one much, but it made the newspaper. Yeah, yeah. So That's one place. I mean, you don't have to leave Chicago. You can just start visiting one Thai temple after another and keep going back to the ones you like the most. And after a while, you begin to spend the night or two there, and then maybe a weekend or two, and pretty soon you're holding a weekly class of meditation and teaching the Dhamma and beginning to fit right in. You don't even have to quit your job until you actually move in. When you move in and start spending every night in the wat, then that would be the time to quit the job because you don't need it

**Speaker B:** anymore.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that I didn't know about myself, and that didn't actually exist when I was on the spiritual journey, thirsting for it, and back, let us say, in the period around 1970. But now there's a lot of Thai, Lao, Cambodian, a few Burmese, a few Sri Lankan wats in the United States that are housed by Asians. Really? And there are.

**Speaker B:** So, so do you recommend— sorry, go ahead.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I would recommend that. I would recommend that you become very friendly Almost as if it would be like, like a courting relationship with a girl, exactly like that, in the sense that you have a date, then you have another date, then you have a weekend together. You know, that's the way you go. Go slowly, but find the watch that you like. And you've got so many, I think there's more than 10 of them in the Chicago area, so you should have a lot of fun just moving around and playing around with those wats. And that would be easy way to do it. You could do exactly the same thing with a plane ticket to Thailand, but then it's not 10 or so wats to go visit. You've got over 20,000.

**Speaker B:** Wow, 20,000!

**Speaker A:** That's really how many there are? Actually, I'm not sure how many there are, but I have heard that there are 20,000 wats that no longer have a monk, because the monks tend to congregate together. And in the old days, there would be 2 or 3 monks out in the woods, and they'd make a wat, and people would come and bring some stuff. And now those old wats— there's one of them that I was very familiar with. The name of it was Wat Wat Phang Boa, and that was on Koh Samui. It was, let us say, a 5-minute walk to the beach. It had its own lagoon, and all the buildings and kutis and everything were just falling apart by then. This was a wat that Ajahn Po stayed at when he was a young monk, but no monk stayed in that wat anymore. Partly because the tourism had started to build up and somebody had built a disco that was too close to the Wat for people to want to stay there. But then the disco went out of business, but the Wat was already falling apart, and that's when I got there in the 1980s. Since then, that Wat, I think, has become property that's part of the international airport. Airport on Koh Samui, which means that it would be very difficult because they always build a fence around the airports. And so this wat now is inside the fence of the airport and would be very difficult to get to. But if you could, you got a really nice place to hang out. There's no food to

**Speaker B:** eat. That sounds like one of those things that you go to and check out, because like how the Buddhist said you should go to the scary places, I'm just thinking of an empty abandoned wat. Sounds pretty creepy.

**Speaker A:** Oh, I was going to tell you about

**Speaker B:** that.

**Speaker A:** Uh, the— this happens with the Lao more than the Thai. This is a Laotian tradition that I'm about to talk about, and that I saw it in Denver. I saw it in Amarillo, I saw it in Dallas, and I've seen it at other places where they get enough land. They were actually talking about planning one in the big laowat in Charlotte. And that is that they build a big, big warehouse kind of building with the understanding that over time this building is going to be populated, and upon first glance it looks like a dormitory with bed after bed after bed after bed after bed, lining this wall, that wall, center walls, all of this. Huge numbers of empty beds, except that the beds are not empty. They are loaded down with monkly kinds of gifts, baskets not of fruit but of items for shaving and soaps and that kind of stuff, all wrapped in orange cellophane wrappers, pillows, robes, and this kind of stuff. And what these things are are offerings for the dead, as well as also on this bed will be an urn. And this is the Lao way of doing it. You see, in Thailand they build individual chedi. So in the back of the wat You'll have chedi after chedi after chedi after chedi after chedi after chedi. A little— some of them are small, some are big, depending upon what the family buys. And there will be a photo of the guy who's died and the ashes.

**Speaker B:** Listen, I'm friends with all the monk ghosts. Don't worry about it. I'm not afraid.

**Speaker A:** Well, this— but this room here, it actually is not intended to be, uh, fearful. But this is, uh, for the lay people, not the monks. This is for the entire lay community. Why would the lay community build such a large building when they've only got 20 or so monks at best? No, this is for the entire population. But in Thailand, they put each one in an individual chedi in Lao for some reason, they have bed after bed after bed that is supposed to be the bed for the person to lie on, except that it's loaded down with all of these gifts of pillows as well as an urn and the photos and maybe some wilted flowers or maybe some plastic flowers, you know, that kind of stuff for funeral stuff. Yeah. Okay, so this is a room that you can go and sleep in. There's probably a bed or two that hasn't been designated for or who gets this when they're not dead yet.

**Speaker B:** I don't know if I could do that. I take it back. That's an interesting one, to spend the night there.

**Speaker A:** Wow. But there's been nobody died in that room. There's no ghost in there. I mean, if you took all the ash and dumped it on the floor, you wouldn't have more than a gallon or so. And that ash is probably not dangerous, but it gives you a chance to figure out what fear is. Yeah, because you recognize, look at all this fear that we've got, and there's nothing here to be afraid of. Absolutely nothing to be afraid of. And then the mop that was leaning on the wall falls

**Speaker B:** over.

**Speaker A:** Wow. Okay, so there are opportunities in the United States now that were not there many, many years ago. Not only that, but the Asians are welcoming. This is not a shotgun wedding, as it were. Okay, uh, they're not going there. It's not like walking onto ISO property or to private property. The, the wats are actually, uh, considered more or less public property. But there will be some hurdles. There'll be language barriers and cultural barriers that the, the Thai people go to their Thai wats, the Lao people go to their Lao wats, so that the Lao people there can do do Lao things that they can't do in the United States unless they're around other Lao people. That's part of the reason why these Lao wats are there, is they're as much a cultural center as they are a wat. And if you did have a cultural center that was, um, uh, like Laotian or Thai, naturally it would be a wat, because the wats in Thailand are the cultural centers here too. And so all of the old ladies— this was especially true in the Lao community— the old— and this was not just in one town, but this was all over the place. It just seemed to be the norm that the old Lao ladies would do their best to get the most authentic roadkill, weird animals, strange plants cooked in strange ways. That was the old Laotian way. In other words, they were trying to recreate the old Laos, even if they had to specially import. But surprisingly enough, the grocery stores in every community were open. There was an Asian grocery store. There's great, you know, in almost every city. And that those grocery stores are often run by Vietnamese who also specialize and will have a Lao section for stuff. It's very interesting like that, that they've got their own kind of thing so that they import this stuff just so that they can show off. And so the way that I said it was, is that I was always perpetually a student of Lao food. Thai food, I got that one, got that one mastered. But Lao food, still a student of Lao food. Yeah, because they could come up with some really strange

**Speaker B:** stuff.

**Speaker A:** So these that had weeds in it and all kinds of things. Weeds? Yeah, little strands of, you know, what the hell is this?

**Speaker B:** Is that what Vendi Bot is like? You got to eat like whatever comes

**Speaker A:** in, like, even if— uh, yes, except at most once. The monks get back together again and then they share amongst themselves what they have, plus there will be additional food brought. Or maybe even in big temples like at Wat Soi Nok, they had their own kitchen, right? And so just because you collected this in your bowl this morning does not mean that, one, you have to eat it all, or number two, you can only eat this. Neither one of those are rules. Yeah, okay. But, but there is a strange story that makes it weird in the sense that when the Buddha passed a provision where he didn't want the monks out at night. One of them complained because for him that was the best time to go out on Pindapat was when the people were eating their dinner. And I guess that there were some complaints about that. And so the Buddha says, let's not go out at night to get food because that's when they're eating dinner. Let's wait till the next morning and go get their leftovers. Okay, and so this monk complained about that, and the Buddha says, well, you don't have to eat it just in the morning, that you can actually get all the food that you want, go on Venerable Bodhisattva and stay on Venerable Bodhisattva all morning, get 2 bowls of food if you want, and then you can have it all day and eat all you want all day long. But at night when you go to bed, you dump it out and give the rest of it to the animals, because otherwise the animals are going to come get the the food, and maybe you too. And so you dump the food out before you go to sleep at night, so you don't keep anything overnight. So that's a way of looking at it. But when you eat is not the issue. And so wake up, Arahant, doesn't have to do with the time of day you're eating the food. It has to do with the time of day you're collecting the food and where you go to get it. That rule actually came about when some monks had gone to, let us say, the equivalent of a state fair. They went to the state fair, 4 or 5 monks walked into the state fair, and they come back with so much stuff that they take it back to their fellow monks and say, look at what we've got. And they share it all around, and some of The monk says, I don't want this stuff because this is not the kind of food that you get from the households. This is party food. This is stuff that's sold at the fair. Where did you get this? And they told him about it. And that's when the point came is that you don't go bothering people when they're trying to do something

**Speaker B:** else.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the people who were there were bothered by the monks. They had to stop their going to the fair stuff in order to go and buy food and give to the monks. And that wasn't appropriate for the monks to have been there at that particular time. That's why it's the wrong time. But actually, it's not the time of day, it was the wrong event or the wrong place— time and place. So that helps you understand that. But other than that, yeah, the monks eat communally. And I have had things put in my bowl like a half-eaten banana. I've had a small fish that are about this size, and you turn it over and all you see is the bones because somebody's eaten the first half of it and they didn't eat the second half, so the monks got it the next

**Speaker B:** morning. Wow. Interesting. Well, that's part of the practice, I bet,

**Speaker A:** right? Actually, the practice that I had coming from my snooty high-quality position, remember that I started with IBM and now I'm a computer scientist and big whoop-de-doo, and I make more money in an hour or a day than these people make. And now I'm letting them, or I'm going to them to get my food. And so that whole quality of status, I had to recognize, wait a minute, there's, there's no status here, that this is different. They don't think of me as who I'm thinking of me. And how dare me think of me as that way when I'm out here just humbly getting some

**Speaker B:** food.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that makes sense. That was, that was an issue that I had to work over, work on, uh, that it wasn't the fact that the food was of low quality, it was the fact that these people were generously offering it to me because that's all they had. And they were still being generous with it. And here I'm holding my nose up, your gifts are not good enough.

**Speaker B:** Right. Wow. Yeah. Well, that's a really interesting story. What's coming to mind, I remember I have like a memory as a kid That, like, I'm remembering, like, as a kid, like, I think I wanted to— I had in my mind, like, being like a traveler that you were, like, you were saying when I was a kid, something like that. Like, thinking

**Speaker A:** about— how many cartoons did you see with a guy with a stick this long with a bandana that's got tied on the end of it? He's got it throwing over his shoulder and he's just off on a trip.

**Speaker B:** Right, that's the monk, like on the boxcar, the train, like, right?

**Speaker A:** The hobo from the 1930s. We don't have hobos now, we have homeless. And the cops keep clearing them out. Well, the cops cleaned them out, out of town in the 1930s, and that's why they would go to the railroad yards, because it was hard for the cops to clean them out there, as well as down in the woods and whatnot like that. My dad was part of that back in the 1930s, the hobos, which is now the homeless, because we got the same problem. They didn't solve the problem, but the mentality of the people has changed. So that in the old days, people actually felt the freedom to just go and see and take a boxcar and just go all over the place. Now they don't do that. One thing, though, it's hard to get the boxcars, but the other one is the people don't feel the freedom. They just seem destitute. Pardon?

**Speaker B:** They just seem destitute. The hobos that I was thinking about like as a kid is probably more like, you know, just going out and like seeing the world and traveling and like, you know, going on an adventure.

**Speaker A:** There was a code. That the hobos had that they would mark a house. They would mark the mailbox or the picket fence or something like that with chalk to say these people are mean, they don't go here, or these people have this kind of food and they're generous. And just a little sign here and there. And so there was a kind of internet of signs that were left with the hobo community.

**Speaker B:** I didn't— I didn't— I don't know any hobo history, so I didn't know that they would go to people's houses. They did that.

**Speaker A:** How are you gonna

**Speaker B:** eat? Homeless people don't come to people's houses nowadays.

**Speaker A:** Well, they'll get shot nowadays.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Times have changed.

**Speaker A:** Times have changed, exactly. But this wanderlust doesn't. And that wanderlust is actually, in a way, part of the spiritual practice of the spiritual journey anyway. This is why we talk about it in the sense of a pilgrim out on a pilgrimage, going someplace, going from holy site to holy site. So this is an old tradition. Humans have been doing this for so long. Some have been quite famous at it— Marco Polo, for

**Speaker B:** one.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. Let's go see what's over that mountain. Let's go over

**Speaker B:** there. That's some bravery.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so that's what I'm talking about. It doesn't have to do with how much money you've got. It has to do with are you ready to

**Speaker B:** go? Yeah, that's a good point.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. Because guess what? You don't know what the future is going to bring. You don't know what money you're going to need. You don't know what choices that you'll be making with or without money. And yet the Western mentality is all about the money. It's the money, money, money, money. Can I get enough money so that I don't need so much money anymore?

**Speaker B:** What? That's a good

**Speaker A:** point. But rather, see what you have is enough. This is good enough. This is fine. This is all we need. Everything's okay. Just enough. A little dab will do you, they

**Speaker B:** say. Yep.

**Speaker A:** If you've ever had Brylcreem. So in fact, uh, uh, Buddha's religion is, is, uh, an advertisement for Brylcreem. You don't know, bro?

**Speaker B:** Cream?

**Speaker A:** Cream? Brylcreem was a hairdressing in the 1960s or whatever like that, to put in the hair to make it slick down. But you don't want to put too much in your hair, just a little dab will do you,

**Speaker B:** right?

**Speaker A:** Just enough, just enough. A little dab will do you, but

**Speaker B:** you don't want to do it stupidly, right? You know, you want to be able

**Speaker A:** to like— oh, you had to be very wise, you had to be open eyes, you had to be very friendly, you have to know how to go places and do things and talk to people and fit in and all of that kind of stuff, and be at home with where you are. Be comfortable and satisfied with what you have.

**Speaker B:** Did you know the language where you went oftentimes? When did you learn

**Speaker A:** Thai? Actually, I still don't know Thai. Oh, I know enough Thai to get myself into a whole lot of

**Speaker B:** trouble.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so I tend to not speak Thai, and the real reason is because my hearing is not good, and because of that, the Thais will speak so fast that I don't understand what they're saying. If they spoke really slowly, then I could pick up the words.

**Speaker B:** How do you speak to, uh, your

**Speaker A:** wife and all that? We together speak a language that is often referred to as Thai-ish. Okay. Which is a mixture of English and Thai and pointing and figuring out things and sometimes coming to the internet and using Google Translate. And sometimes we put in images, like the last time it happened years ago, and the joke is about a helicopter. I won't tell you the joke. But here I am going to Google, typing in helicopter image, and showing. And she said, oh yeah, I know. All right, so, but without that, without that image, who knows what a helicopter is translated to in Thai? Yeah, that's funny. Things like airplanes are easy. Kruen bin, because the word bin is to fly and kruen is the word for machine. So flying machine is the word, but a helicopter is a flying machine, but it's not an

**Speaker B:** airplane.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but really it's the speed of the language that's the problem. When they slow it down, I can begin to understand better.

**Speaker B:** So how did you sort of, you know, what was that like coming from America, you get off the plane and you're at the Wat now. How are you communicating with

**Speaker A:** people? Why should I want to do

**Speaker B:** that? You got to be friendly, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but you don't have to jawbone a lot. Just be friendly. Oh, okay. Yeah, there's enough. Doesn't take a whole lot. If you're going to be enemies, that takes an awful lot of language, an awful lot of words.

**Speaker B:** So smile, don't take too long. Just a smile is all it takes, handshake or bow.

**Speaker A:** All right, yeah, that's all it takes, right? Everything is cool, no

**Speaker B:** problem. Nice. Wow, that's the attitude. So how did you have such a great attitude to

**Speaker A:** start? It wasn't there in the beginning. It had to be developed. Oh, okay. But I was lucky enough to be around Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and other monks who pointed out that that's part of what needs to be developed. That's what the sankhapa is all about. Samma Sanghappa is to develop the right attitude. So you could go so far as to say that that's really the whole teaching Buddha. There's attitude, right attitude, the attitude of Dukkha or the attitude of Dukkha,

**Speaker B:** Nirodha.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you have the attitude that this is tough, you got the attitude of this is easy.

**Speaker B:** Yep,

**Speaker A:** yep. So let's change this topic into one of the others that you were talking about, and that is how to spread the Dharma and what is needed and things like that, especially giving advice to others on sexual issues. Okay, yeah, first off, within the teachings of the Buddha, we look at it as the Dhamma is a gift to be given, and that it is best given when it is best received. And when it is well given and well received, both people get joy out of it, or rather say it's available. And that in fact, while sharing the Dharma, if the student or the teacher is really paying attention to it, they can actually go into the first Jhana while they're talking about the Dhamma. How can that possibly happen? It's because first off, the Dhamma is all wholesome all the time, one wholesome thought after another after another. And that's the way of looking at it. And so we begin to feel really good about the Dhamma being really one good thought after another after another. Another with one good feeling after another after another. So actually sharing the Dharma is a marvelous gift because it actually can place people into a marvelous state right in the present moment, and it gives them something that they can possibly carry away, not only the mere experience of good feelings but also of handy

**Speaker B:** information.

**Speaker A:** However, Westerners coming from their Western mentality and critical and whatnot often give advice in the form of what is right, what is wrong, what is should, what is could, what is critical. You should do this, you should not do this, and then it's not Dharma anymore, it's just ordinary critical thinking. Yeah, so we have to be careful about how we're giving the Dhamma. And the most important quality of it is that it's best given as a gift when it's best received, which means don't tell anybody to do anything because that's not going to be well received. It never has been. You You didn't like being told what to do when you were a kid, you didn't like it as a teenager, didn't like it in college, you didn't like it, you don't like it today, and you're certainly not going to keep calling me if I keep telling you what to do. So I had to be careful not to tell people what to do, but to share the Dhamma as a gift instead, and let them figure out for themselves what to do. Okay, that's an important thing. And so we can't tell people what to do, but we can offer the Dhamma as something that's liberating. In other words, um, uh, if, if someone gets themselves into a great deal of desire, then I think of the song "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes." Have you heard that by The Platters of the 1950s? When your heart's on fire, burning with desire, smoke gets in your eyes.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** I never heard it, right? But you see what wisdom that is, is when your heart's on fire, burning with desire, smoke gets in your eyes.

**Speaker B:** You can't see straight.

**Speaker A:** Can't see straight. Not only that, but things are painful to look at. Yeah, yeah. So this is a way of speaking, is to allow the people to see the danger rather than pointing out the danger or thinking that because you know the danger, they see the danger, and therefore they should be able to follow the rule because the rule was set up because somebody saw the danger. That's like when the road is out, right? It's dangerous for people to fall into that pothole, so they'll put up a tronchon, uh, you know, a sawhorse kind of thing that's got stripes on it so that people can see it. All right, that's all the rules. Guess what? The whole world is filled with the human minds of human people that have all of those roadblocks up all over the place. Yeah, all kinds of places that people have designated as being dangerous, and the kids have to figure that out for themselves. You've got to go and fall in your own pothole. And then you put up your own sawhorse or sign saying, "Danger, danger, don't go there." But this is a major teaching of the Buddha that people do what they do because they seek gratification in doing it like that. For instance, when somebody has anxiety, they see the gratification and thinking up something that caused that anxiety and then go fix that so that the anxiety will go away. And basically what happens is the anxiety only goes away while they're busy doing that fix job, but when the fix job is over, they come back and now they're back into anxiety again. Yeah, okay. But they took on that job to do because they saw that as a delicious way of avoiding the anxiety, or they thought that they could get rid of the anxieties, and so it was delicious. This is what we mean by the gratification, that we do things because we have been told and we expect results. If I do this, I should get that. This is the gratification that we're looking for. Now, in regard to sexual activities and whatnot, generally sexual activities for one reason or another are associated with danger. There's dangerous things that can happen. Now, in modern times, those dangers have been modified by medical science, but in the old days and the time of the Buddha and before that, Sex was always downright dangerous. Okay, you could— if you had sex, you could get killed by the father-in-law. If the girl got pregnant, she could die with the baby. Women were chattel property. If that girl is wound up without all of the necessary equipment upon her wedding day, then she may get wound up dead on the doorstep of of her old man who should have been protecting her. You see all of this old stuff that's come into modern society, all the old dangers that all the religions knew about. Instead of talking about it in the sense of what the dangers are, they talk about it in the sense of these are the rules, kids. You can't do that until you get married. And the kids, they say, well, I can do that. But now the kids are not warned of the danger. This is why abstinent-only sexual education doesn't work, is because they're not teaching the dangers, or they're putting the dangers in a spiritual world rather than letting the dangers be real. Because the dangers still are real, it's just that we're able to mollify some of those dangers now, but not all of them. That sexuality and sexual stuff continues to have a lot of dangers to it, including the relationship itself. That the man and the woman come together and they get familiar, they get used to each other, and then one or another of them will wind up with some wanderlust, which is quite natural, and one of them wants out of the relationship. And so the getting— the breaking up of the relationship winds up being fraught with Dukkha. And it takes a whole lot of wisdom to have a good divorce. Very few divorces are good divorces. Almost all of them are, let us say, they're— it's like bread that's been sliced with a knife because of wisdom versus just being torn apart and that's usually what happens with relationships. These are just torn apart the way one end of the loaf is torn away from the other end of the loaf. This is the problem then of relationships that a lot of people don't understand. The Buddha talks about it in this way. There's actually the name of a sutta, I think it's number 80 7, 8, it's in the '80s someplace, 86 I know is the Angulimala Sutta. Anyway, the name of this sutta is 'Grief Comes from Those Who Are Dear.' There's where he is actually pointing at that relationship. If you develop a strong relationship with someone, one of you going to be dead, which is enough Dukkha for most people, and the other one is going to be sobbing in grief because of that person dead. Now, that person dying can be because they left the house, they went to work. But if you've got an abandonment issue, when that person leaves, you feel abandoned from them, and therefore you start to grieve. So that people who have an abandonment issue, they will cling really tight to a relationship, causing the other person in that relationship to really want that wanderlust or that freedom very quickly. And so people who have abandonment issues go from one torn relationship after another, and it's very difficult for them to establish relationships because they need one so badly. Arahant. Okay, so there's a lot of stuff that can be understood about this, and you know the particular situation a lot better than I do. But dwell on what the dangers are that he can see as dangers. And the way that you can get that is by asking questions. Don't you think it's blah blah? Or What do you think about that? So that they can actually, by answering those questions, begin to think about it, to begin to see what is dangerous. Because only after we see the danger can we begin to see the escape.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, the situation in this case was about, um, he was looking at some of the benefits of abstaining, is what we were talking about. Is what he was thinking about, like taking this challenge on. And I was looking at it and I was thinking, I mean, yeah, I think that's like a step in the right direction, essentially. But like from the perspective of if you're not like practicing, like being satisfied, it just seems like a really good recipe of just being a really dissatisfied, abstaining guy.

**Speaker A:** That's exactly right. So in this regard, the danger is that he will abstain in a way that gives him a whole lot of suffering. Like he wants it, he wants it, he wants it, he wants it, and then, "No, you can't have it. No, you can't have it. I've set a rule. This is a challenge." And you see all of that one-up, one-down parent saying, "No, you can't," and the child saying, "You watch." "No, you can't." 'You watch.'

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** 'Oh yes, I can.' And I wanted, and I wanted, and I wanted. And so finally he does the deed, and now he's going to be full of remorse because, I mean, he set a rule, didn't he? Yeah. Okay, so there's, there's dangers in, in any direction that you go in. So you have to make sure that he understands the danger. That's the way to teach the Dhamma, is so that they can understand. Don't teach— don't try to point out the dangers so much, but you can dance around them so that he can figure out the dangers for

**Speaker B:** himself.

**Speaker A:** Because otherwise we'll put it in there as a set of rules. Right, we'll go, we'll go, uh, put our own, uh, uh, sawhorses up in his mind, which he doesn't want. He's got to put up his own sawhorses. And so this is how we have to learn to teach the Dharma, is so that the students themselves can see the dangers. And once they see the dangers— and he's already been able to see some dangers— if he can see some dangers in sexuality with which we've been talking about, then he's trying to avoid those dangers by setting up another dangerous

**Speaker B:** situation. So it's like a good question because I know that they set up— I feel like in this group, it's like a group, and they kind of put out a lot of benefits that are to be had. Like at day 500 of your abstinence, you're going to get like these superpowers. And I'm just like, I mean, I guess maybe, I don't know it's possible, but you know, it just seems like a whole lot of the same story that we played our whole lives. Like, do go to school and do this and you'll be happy on this at this point in time, right?

**Speaker A:** That's exactly what's there. So then the dangers in that regard are

**Speaker B:** multiple.

**Speaker A:** For instance, what happens on day 500 and no cities

**Speaker B:** happen?

**Speaker A:** Right. What if day 5,000 and no siddhis happen? What if he cannot see or discern any benefit at all after 5,000 days? Also, there is another kind of danger, surprisingly enough, and that danger is prostate cancer. Do you know that even though there is so much, let us say, publicity and news about pedophilia in the ranks of priests within the Catholic Church, but one of the things that they don't advertise is that prostrate cancer is rampant among the priests who abstain from sex, don't have it, won't get it, and then their things down there start to rot away from lack of use. Yeah, yeah. So there's got to be a middle path in there someplace. Yeah. Okay, so that's the danger that you can point out to this group, that hey, there's an awful lot of Catholic priests that go a whole lot longer than 500 days. 500 days is only about a year and a half, you know. Priests that have gone for 15 years. Yeah, they've gone for 5,000 days and they still have nothing. They don't even have any little boys. I mean, they've got nothing. Yeah, they're not particularly happy. They don't have any particular magical powers. Yeah, they did, they'd fly out of that church, but they

**Speaker B:** don't. That's a funny one. That's a funny image. That could be a good cartoon.

**Speaker A:** Exactly right. You could see them. You can see the calendar on the wall of the priest and he's checking it off, and finally 5,000, and he checks that off, and then he wings and he just flies out. Okay, I put my time in, now I can

**Speaker B:** fly. Oh my

**Speaker A:** God. So there's a lot of dangers when people put pressures on themselves like that to do without something that's natural ingredient. We need to deal with it naturally at a natural level. Now there's the other side of the coin that we'll talk about, and that is, is that look at the the sales and the promotions and all the stuff associated with Cevallos. And, um, oh, what is it? Viagra. Viagra Dang, right? That's what they have in Thailand. The dang means red. Viagra Red means it is manufactured in India. But elderly men want that product. Young men don't buy Cialis. Young men don't buy Viagra. You don't see them in the commercials. There's always those guys that have got a little bit of graying hair, even though they're very handsome. Even in the commercials, they'll have the makeup artist put a few strands of gray hair in there to point out that Viagra and Cialis is for old men. Yeah, well now wait a minute, aren't these young men saying, wouldn't it be nice if that equipment down there didn't get up and bother me? And now here the old men are going around and the darn thing don't get up and bother them, and they take pills to make it get up and bother

**Speaker B:** them.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so it still has a whole lot to do with attitude, that in fact the whole concept of celibacy is that concept of doing without in order to get a future reward. That's practiced in Catholicism, is practiced in, uh, Hinduism, is practiced in many places. And you could also go so far that with Buddhist monks that they kind of sometimes practice it there. But there's another attitude that you can take, and in that sense you don't call it celibacy, you call it freedom. Freedom! Yeah, right. Why? Because I can see where I'm going without having my heart get on fire, burning with desire. Yeah, right. Because when our heart's on fire, burning with desire, then we can't see what we're

**Speaker B:** doing. That's where— that's where I feel like I'm at with the whole situation. But yeah, or again, I don't know, that's the— I I mean, it just seems foolish to think otherwise at this point, for me at least. It just seems like you're hurting yourself if you go and you would— the whole point of the Dhamma, the whole point of the Second Noble Truth is this liking that's followed by this desire, that's followed by the sense of self that wants it, right? So you are inherently just hurting yourself by driving towards— especially if you pursue it. At that point, if you're pursuing it, then you're just saying, you know, you're asking for

**Speaker A:** trouble. Exactly. Well, you see, you've been working through that stuff over the course of the time in the past few months that we've been talking together, and you've been able to see that for yourself. He probably is not going to be able to see it as clearly as that yet. So he has to be able to see clearly that many of the things that he wants are dangerous. For instance, he's making a choice about long-term. He's not saying, oh, I can resist the temptation right now, and we can deal with that as a kind of a microcosm because that's really all that needs to be dealt with is what's happening right now. Yeah. And yet he's putting all of this future on it, 500 days or whatever in there. Yeah. And we can also see that, um, that if we deal with it incorrectly that in fact getting all hot and bothered and then not ejaculating is possibly what is causing the prostate cancer. But they don't know this yet. They haven't done enough research. They've barely been able to touch off that the real issue is that there is lack of Well, let us say that celibacy is connected with prostate cancer, but cities are only connected with celibacy in the minds of those who were greedy for the

**Speaker B:** cities.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay, that's the only connection that's there. If I do without the very, very best that life has to offer, then life will finally give me something a whole lot better. Bliss or cities or powers or whatever like that. So you can also approach it in the sense, well, if you had such powers, how would you feel? And can you feel that way without those powers?

**Speaker B:** I don't think it's actual powers. I think it was just like, you know, it might be like we're not talking about flying here exactly.

**Speaker A:** I'm talking about maybe like— How about

**Speaker B:** jumping? I think it's— I think what it's about is like, you know, maybe confidence, maybe more drive to do your work, maybe like more mental clarity, like that kind of like basic life improvement type stuff.

**Speaker A:** But that's the way that the Buddha defines it. Those are the real powers. Okay, in fact, the Pali word is, uh, uh, iddya. That is— well, that's what I'm saying,

**Speaker B:** then you might as well practice Anapanasati, what the Buddha taught. But hey, what do I know?

**Speaker A:** Okay, in, in the, in the Sanskrit, the word is Citta. But in the Pali it is iddhi, and that the iddhi, iddhi-apada, the foundations of these powers, the foundation of these powers are the same as you find in the Eightfold Noble Path. You'll definitely find mindfulness as one of the foundations of the power. You will find investigation as one of the foundations of the Power, you will find right effort is one of the foundations of the Power, and you will find that these foundations of the Powers are exactly the same thing as the skills that we need to develop anyway. And that the idyapada is mentioned right there in the Anapanasati Sutta as one of the things that we're practicing. Anapanasati is for the fulfillment of the idyapada, the power, real power. What is that real power? The power that we're actually talking about now is the power of feeling safe and secure. "Ere though you walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil." Not because of bat

**Speaker B:** rod, I think I missed that one.

**Speaker A:** Is that a— oh yeah, that's about— oh, this is Psalms 23. Sorry, I should have done that. I'll go for the whole thing. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff to comfort me. And then I said, but it's not that kind of rod, you see. But in that in fact, um, the rod or the staff here is the rod or the staff that the shepherd carries to keep the, uh, the, uh, the goats and the sheep separated from the wolves. Okay, so he has that rod or the staff as protection, and that's all he needs. And so he can walk through the valley of the wolves and fear no

**Speaker B:** evil.

**Speaker A:** So this is actually what the idya has to do with, is becoming fearless, right? Power. This is the way that we look at it. But a guy who is celibate and is worried that, oh, I've been 374 days now, only got 190 left to go, and wow, this is terrible, terrible, but I can endure. And so he's got so much discomfort, you see, because he wants something. He wants these powers that would come naturally if he understood them better. And so the real power is the power of success. The real power is the power of the feeling of safety, security, satisfaction, comfort, being at ease. And in fact, the key word is satisfaction. Why? Because Dukkha is just the opposite of that. Things are dissatisfaction. So the guys who are practicing celibacy are coming to it from the perspective of dissatisfaction. I want something and I'm willing to give up my cock to get it. Yeah, yeah, that's it. And so he's doomed to— maybe he won't think of it as failure immediately, but he's certainly doomed to having Dukkha, as opposed to waking up and say, hey, wait a minute, I don't need this thing. Yeah, I'm okay without it. You'd be surprised how flat that thing will go when you stop thinking about

**Speaker B:** it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, when you get your mind off of it and on to something more wholesome, more pleasant, then it doesn't mean anything anymore. It's not a bother, it's not a big obstacle.

**Speaker B:** It's a little counterintuitive to say like This is the— like, I don't know, I guess it's kind of like a not-to-do list at the same time. But if you make it a big thing, then it's kind of like it's going to come. You're going to think about it. Now I can't do this thing.

**Speaker A:** Well, on the not-to-do list would then be to not think about it, right? Hey, I got better things to think about than that girl that came to the wat 3 weeks ago. I don't even remember what she looks like now. Yeah, okay. So out of sight, out of mind. And yet in our culture— he likes that phrase.

**Speaker B:** Maybe I should just tell him that.

**Speaker A:** What's that?

**Speaker B:** Out of sight, out of mind. That's what he would say a lot.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, if that's the case, if he knows that much about it, then withdrawing from the society and not being around women, not seeing them on the internet, not seeing them on on, uh, the TV, not seeing them dancing or shaking their booties or advertising or, um, anything like that, that he completely secludes himself from it, things don't get out of hand or in hand,

**Speaker B:** whichever.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's funny. So yes, out of sight is the right way to do it is again seclusion, and then it's not so much of a bother. But living in the world with all of that advertisement, and it floods the mind, invades the mind, and remains, and things tend to build up from

**Speaker B:** there.

**Speaker A:** Yep. Wow, so many puns today. Build up from there, I know what that

**Speaker B:** is. Yeah, yeah, I noticed that. So I recently had a pretty good, a very good day yesterday. And then I feel we talked, we've had the same story before, but I had a very good day and I was feeling really good. And then I started watching a whole bunch of YouTube videos. And I was still feeling really good, like, while I was watching it. I was like watching videos about like puppies or like animals, like vet care. And I was like, oh, this is wholesome. This is very wholesome. I was like, okay. But then, like, soon enough, like, next thing I know, it's like midnight and I'm still watching videos. But now I'm watching like some other like videos that's stirring up my mind and concocting my mind. And then I just, I was like, it's like it's a slippery slope. And it just gets deeper and deeper, and it just seems like smarter.

**Speaker A:** That's right. Where do you draw the line? I mean, it can get bright— bright things like puppies dancing and playing and joy and all of that— and then a little bit darker and a little bit darker and a little bit darker and a little bit darker until now you're in a very dark place where you've got two politicians arguing with each other over this bill or that bill, or even worse than that. I mean, things get dark in a hurry.

**Speaker B:** I went from puppies to just like guys arguing on the internet. It was really bad. And so, and so, I don't know, after that I just saw like how good of a day I was having until I did that. I was like, wait a minute, like maybe what I did was I went on my YouTube and and I made it so that I only like look at my subscriptions, and my subscriptions are like Dhamma stuff and then one like race car guy. So I left it at that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, uh, in the beginning it is very, very useful to stay away from arguments, um, and discussions that two people have when each one of them is holding a position, because they're not going to be able to convince each other of anything. And all they can do is make you, while you're watching it, feel bad and perhaps confused. Or you'll take a side, and yes, you agree with this guy, and then you don't agree with this guy. And all of that. It's better to leave those kind of discussions alone unless you're already beyond it. And the way to get beyond it is by being able to turn it off or put it down at any second, as soon as you recognize that this, this is no good from this mind, and off you

**Speaker B:** go. I started to see that, and what I— when I saw it, I think it was actually kind of valuable because it seemed like it applied to not only just watching arguments and stuff, but I could almost— I don't know, in my mind it's like at this point what's happening is like, why did I even— why did I go there in the first place? Is the first question I ask myself. Why did I even pick up the phone in the first place? And I was thinking, well, maybe if next time I go for the phone, I check, am I satisfied right now? And maybe if I get satisfied, I don't need to pick pick up the phone.

**Speaker A:** That's a very important— that's excellent, right? That, that you can actually use— you can incorporate the phone itself as an anchor, just like we originally start using the breath as an anchor. So every time that you pick up that cell phone, you could do a bit of Anapanasati right then and there. You can do an investigation. Why did I pick up this phone? What am I wanting? Am I okay right now? Everything is happy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** I pick up the phone, can I, can I make a, a check? Can I make sure everything is okay? Yeah. And then we can continue doing that while we're on the phone because there's more than likely something unwholesome going to come back. I mean, the whole internet is based upon that argument. Unholds critical thinking. We got to make this thing better and better. We got to find out where the lies and where the truth is.

**Speaker B:** Another thing I noticed, yeah, another thing I noticed was like, it seems like when I go to a YouTube, I mean, maybe it's not the same when it's a Dharma video or whatever, but like when I go to a movie, I go to a video game, I go to something else, It feels like what I'm doing is offering my mind, like, in my hand, like, here, do what you will with it. Concoct my mind, please.

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly so. And people in general want that. Why? Why would they want that? It's because they're dissatisfied with the shape that it's in now, with the thought of, oh, I am bored, let me turn on the TV. And give my mind to the TV, right? So that, that will take my mind away, and then I don't have to deal with it anymore.

**Speaker B:** But then they determine how you feel.

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker B:** So, so they can just take a sledgehammer to it,

**Speaker A:** and they often do.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. I only want to give my mind to the, to the guys that I trust, like, you know, Santi Karo and Bhikkhu.

**Speaker A:** Don't watch shampoo commercials. Who? Don't watch shampoo commercials.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, good

**Speaker A:** point. Unless of course they're advertising a shampoo that you could use on a crusty old bear, and that's who they show you getting shampooed. Normally they don't show a crusty old bear or a dog getting a bath. They find the cutest young girl that they can find with the longest, silkiest hair, right? They do that on purpose. Yeah, they do it with the idea that girls, if you buy this, you'll look like this girl on TV. And, and, uh, to the boys, they say you can have a girl like this one on TV if you buy our product. Yep. And nobody believes any of that, but they still wind up wanting that girl or wanting to be that

**Speaker B:** girl. Yeah, that's why, uh, it's time for me to get away from it all pretty soon

**Speaker A:** here. Yeah, so the ads are the worst. So, uh, your, your city guy who is wanting to practice celibacy, keep them away from the television.

**Speaker B:** I'm just going to tell

**Speaker A:** them out of sight, out of mind. Right. Out of sight, out of mind. Exactly. If you don't see her, you don't think about her. Exactly.

**Speaker B:** There you go. Yeah. So the next thing I wanted to talk about, though, was Anapanasati and make sure that I'm practicing correctly.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** I don't know. It's just like recently in my sit today, I find it interesting, like how I mentioned like yesterday I was like really good. And then like, do you find that like after you take like a path, like of not being mindful, that it takes like you got to get back on the path kind of, even if it's just like half a day? I guess you gave me a good analogy with that one time. You remember the piano player and he says He says if he doesn't practice for one day, the maid will notice.

**Speaker A:** Oh yes, right, that was Rubenstein. That impressed me when I heard that from him because he was not as old as he was. I mean, he died in the '90s. He was in his '90s when he died, but he was in his 70s or 80s when he was talking about this. That if he misses even a day of practice, he'll know it. If he misses 2 days of practice, the housekeeper will know it. If he misses 3 days of practice, the dog will know it. Yeah, yeah. And so yes, we can see that way within our own mind, except that with the practice of Anapanasati, kind of the thought that comes often is, "There it is

**Speaker B:** again." Yeah, it did happen.

**Speaker A:** That in-breath, right? There it is. Yeah, I've noticed it over and over and over again. Yep, there it is, that in-breath.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I was kind of like yesterday, I was kind of impressing myself a little bit with like my— because I actually like, I think that I watched most, like a lot of my breaths, like for like the beginning of the day for the most part, like most of them, but just like not even necessarily sitting down but actually just Anapanasati throughout the day, just like watching the breath. And I thought that was really great, but I have not really been able to do that as well today.

**Speaker A:** I don't know, but you don't have to watch it all day, just this one.

**Speaker B:** Just this one.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, just this one. There it is.

**Speaker B:** There it is. Okay, just this one. That's what I'm going to go by now. So with my Anapanasati practice, what I do is now what I'm kind of looking at is like I obviously want to start seizing the breath. I think sometimes I feel like I'm not sure about if I'm spending too many mind moments, seizing the knowing that this is a long breath, because it really shouldn't take that long to know, just be like, one, I just know that this is a long breath. Or do you like really try and be like, I don't know, I feel like I try and say it, like say like, this is a long breath, like that's helpful to like fully comprehend that this is a long in-breath. But I feel like you could also just kind of tap in and just touch in and know this is a long breath, okay, and then on to the next.

**Speaker A:** Well, when we are actually taking the long deep in-breath and we know that it's a long deep in-breath, that's actually a thought. It may not be a verbal thought, but it certainly is a mind moment of paying attention and what's aware. In that regard, you can know that you know that this is a long in-breath and that you know that that's the only thing that you know right now, that this is what we're thinking is this is a long deep in-breath. And then the mind might start up in something verbal. The question is, is that when it starts into the verbal, is this verbal wholesome or is this unwholesome. But so long as you're actually paying attention to the breath itself, you don't have to worry about what kind of thought it is, because it's going to be wholesome because it's right here now watching the breath. That's a wholesome thought. The unwholesome is coming when we go into the past or into the future or into the thinking or whatever like this. But this particular moment is okay when we're thinking about the breath. But generally, the mind will start up. The question is, does it start up wholesome, intentionally? Because you can actually intentionally start it up with having good, wholesome thoughts about the breath itself. Wow, this is a nice breath. You can begin to describe the breath.

**Speaker B:** You can begin to describe— That was my next question. So like In terms of skill development and practicing and seizing at each step, I'm kind of noticing what I do like to do though is come in and say, okay, I could come in off the beginning and just saying like, okay, like, or at least maybe for more so the out-breath, I would say the out-breath I like to go like, and maybe like to start with like the job is done, like, and the job is done, feel like really satisfied. But then like, maybe I'll get like in my mind, I'll be like, okay, but like, and I also know that this is a long out breath or like, you know, it's like, am I ordering it correctly? Like, should I say this is going to be a long out breath and then the job is done or is the job done? And then this is a— you know what I

**Speaker A:** mean? What difference does it make? Or another way of thinking of it is, is that recognize that that is a thought of doubt, a doubt of insecurity, of doubt. I don't know which way to do it. Yeah, where in fact it really doesn't even matter which way you do it, but what is better is to choose one and do it without doubt. The doubt becomes the hindrance right then and there. And those thoughts of doubt— which comes first, the chicken or the egg? You know the whole

**Speaker B:** show.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. All right, so recognize that doubt as doubt, and recognize the doubt as a hindrance. Asking questions in that state is basically doubt. We can say if I'm asking myself questions about my practice while I'm practicing, then that's doubt, because I actually do know how to practice. Been over and over again, I've been successful before, so why should I be picking on this stuff when I could just be enjoying myself instead? Yeah, trying to get it right. Right? Yeah. Trying to get it perfect.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but we talked about that. We talked about slowing it down and getting the fingering right, you know? That's why I'm just like— that's what I'm trying to like say, like, okay, like, if I really break this down, if I really slow this down, what's the right way to do it? That's why I'm asking the question.

**Speaker A:** Okay, uh, the answer is, is that the mind is actually complicated enough to do more than one thing at a time. Okay, or at least it appears that way. In an Anagami moment, several things will have to happen, and so a lot can go in that direction of things begin to happen kind of together. For instance, it takes a while for a breath And you can have a lot of different thoughts during that breath. But if you start to have thoughts about what should I do first or what should be done next is a doubt that keeps us from actually saying the things that need to be said. Instead of having doubtful thoughts about, should I take a deep breath and then gladden the mind, or should I gladden the mind and then take a deep breath? And you're not doing either one of them. You're in doubt. Instead of saying, I'll do one this time and I'll do the other next time and I'll play with it and I'll figure it out.

**Speaker B:** Okay, because one that's coming to my mind right now is to say Just say like, wow, this is a really nice long out-breath.

**Speaker A:** Yes, this is good.

**Speaker B:** Both in there, it's nice and it's long.

**Speaker A:** Nice and long. And the mind is so relaxed and so easygoing, don't have to whack it right now because it's good. Yeah. But then if those thoughts of doubt come in like we just are talking about, you whack those. Arahant, I see you doubt. Right? And I'm being doubtful over this or that when this, this or that in the order that they're in is completely irrelevant and easily

**Speaker B:** investigated. Yeah, we know that it's irrelevant too because we're not even practicing like steps 1 through 16 in that order anyway.

**Speaker A:** So we're not doing it in that order anyway. We're one by one as they occur. As things arise. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. I think that's the question. The doubt was stemming from that, actually, that one by one, because it's like, oh wait, I'm doing like, I don't know if I can do two at a time or whatever. But it's okay if you do two at a time.

**Speaker A:** Okay. That should not be too much of an issue. One by one as they occur, can be thought of depending upon the time duration. In other words, what is synchronicity? Is it nanoseconds? Is it half seconds? Is it a tenth of a second? That kind of thing. We don't really care about what the word simultaneously or together actually mean. Because they can in fact have an overlap, or they can merge from one to the other, or they can go seamlessly back and forth. And so which one you do first is not so important, but recognizing that you have doubt about which one comes first as a hindrance, and that— aha, I see that. Yeah. And the doubt is actually wanting something that you don't have, saying, if I do this first or if I do that first, then what will I get? In the sense of, hey, I don't have to have that kind of doubt. I can, you know, gladden the mind and take a breath, and it doesn't really matter which order that they're in. And often they, like I said, for a more advanced student to especially, they kind of happen

**Speaker B:** together. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Um, at least sometimes. Other times they don't happen

**Speaker B:** together. Yeah, because I think that what I might have been doing was like starting to think more about what I'm doing. Like, I don't know, think more about the steps, like in between. Like, okay, now move to this, now move to that.

**Speaker A:** I don't know. Okay, that's part of the skill development. As these things grind in, it's not so important. That you visit them in or out of any particular order, so long as you cover them all, or that you only cover part of them. All of these things become kind of irrelevant because eventually, over 5 or 10 minutes of practice, you're going to be touching all of them here and there, that you are going to see Anicca, you're going to see things change. You're going to see that you're letting go and relinquishing. So even the higher steps of Anapanasati will be there. But the one thing that we want to operate first is to understand that the number one skill is Sati. That's the big one, to keep coming back, coming back, coming back. And when we're in doubt, guess what, Sati is not there, even though we think that there's Sati there because we're actually practicing Anapanasati, in that moment what we have instead is confusion, of doubt. So in that mind moment there was no Sati, but the next mind moment there will be some Sati, especially if the Sati is coming, I don't care which order, so long as I'm bringing myself into a state of Sukkha, And so we could say then that Sukkha and Piti are the Jhana factors, but I wouldn't say that any of them are more important than the others, but they do kind of come in the order that you have to get rid of the hindrances first. And so even that hindrance of doubt about which one to do or another is kind of in the way actually doing it. And so once the mind is completely free from the hindrances, now the thoughts are actually going to be wholesome, not going to be filled with doubt. And so naturally the thought of wholesome breath and the wholesome breath are going to be interjoined. They kind of come together. But if you're thinking, but if your mind moment has, which one do I do first? You're not doing either one of them in that moment, you're just in doubt at that moment. And so when does the Sati come back? Well, the Sati hopefully will come back when you actually do take that deep in-breath, because we're pegging the Sati to that breath, mindful. And in fact, that's something the way that the sutta is constructed, with every one of the stages It says it in the sense of mindfully. Now that word is the English language, but it's called Sati. Sati on the in-breath, he develops joy. Sati on the out-breath, he develops joy. Thus one trains oneself. And so we always go back to that Sati on the in-breath and Sati on the out-breath while we're training. In Sukkha, while we're training in the feeling of being a winner, or the feeling of being successful, the feeling of being a lion, the feeling of right attitude. So we're developing that while we breathe in mindfully, and while we breathe out mindfully. So every stage of Anapanasati has that sequence in it that has the verb to train or to develop. And also every one of them has mindfully breathing in, I train or develop to do this task. And then the next sentence will mindfully he train, mindfully he will breathe out, training to do that. Yep. So mindfully he breathes in, training to have Sukkha. Mindfully he breathes out, training to have Sukkha. Mindfully breathing in to develop Piti. Mindfully training to breathe out, or mindfully breathing out, training to do Piti. This is the way that it's actually stated in the sutta over and over again. Hopefully we get the idea from the Buddha, because we only have his words, we don't have his emphasis upon this, other than the repetition of the words that always in our language, repetition gives more emphasis. And everything has to be repetitive. Over and over and over again. We've already talked about Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. Yep. Okay, so that repetitive part over and over and over again. Mindfully breathing in, we train for Sukkha. Mindfully breathing out, we train for Sukkha.

**Speaker B:** The, uh, there's a video with Sankhara talking about, uh, Bhikkhu translation that he was doing, he said using the breath sort of like a metronome in that way. It was sort of like, I don't really even know if I really know what a metronome is, but the way I took that and I started practicing this way was sort of like, I guess at the top or at the bottom, whatever it is, like the beginning of the breath. And now we train ourselves on this in-breath, this Piti. And then at the top again, it's like it goes off again. So Sati, the long out-breath, and then we train ourselves as we go down, the Sukkha. Yes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yes. Now we don't have to do it in any particular order, but we do know that we do an in-breath followed by an out-breath, that we rarely do have an in-breath followed by another in-breath followed by by another in-breath, by another in-breath. The only time that it ever happens, I think, is for tokers. For who? Tokers, you know, like— and now I've got so much in, and then I go— yeah, but other than that, we don't do it like that. We normally do an in-breath followed by an out-breath, or in-breath in-breath followed by an out-breath. But there's all kinds of ways that you can play with the breathing, to make it a toy, something to pay attention to, knowing that there is great benefit in doing it, not great benefit later, but great benefit right now, that this is the best thing that I could do right now. Is to sit here and enjoy breathing. And so this is the quality then that we bring with that breath is that, and sometimes I say this to the students, do you like breathing? Isn't that in-breath so refreshing? If you don't think so, then stop breathing for a while. And if you stop for a minute or two or 3 or 5 or 10, that next in-breath, if you ever get around to it, is going to be so delicious, but you got to do it while you're still alive because that breath is going to keep you alive. That's how wonderful that in-breath is, is it's actually going to keep you alive. That's life itself. And this is— the old scriptures are just so full of this that everybody understood that breathing is life itself. Even in the precepts, when they talk about not killing, they're actually talking about panatipada, and there it is, Anapana, taking the breath away, panatipada, to take away the breath. And also, whenever you die, the last breath that you have is always an exhale. That's why they call it expire, to breathe out. And then we don't take a new breath. So if you think about every breath like that, then this breath is life-giving. It is sustaining your entire existence. You should be able to appreciate this new in-breath. Yeah. And so this is how we begin to see it, is that, wow, isn't it marvelous that I get one more breath? Let me enjoy it to its fullest.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I heard you say something recently and something that I heard from Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's translation recently too that impacted me was hearing about one you said was, as you go to sleep, you can see the last breath, the last mind moment. You can know the last mind moment before you go to sleep if you're mindful. And then one from Bhikkhuni was the story of the monk and he tells his two students to like stand here and stand here, and he walks up and he walks back down, and then he walks in the middle of them, and then he just dies and lets them hold him because he knew exactly like when that— which breath was his last breath. Because he knew his breath so well, he knew when he was going to die.

**Speaker A:** Everybody does. The question is, what kind of mind state are we going to be in when it happens? Because everybody knows this is

**Speaker B:** it.

**Speaker A:** Interesting. Sometimes it's a false alarm in the sense like in an accident, in an automobile accident, and you see that this is going to happen, this is going to be deadly, and then somehow you survive. But everybody has that feeling that this is it, and generally they get it on that last one. Yeah, sometimes we don't even get the opportunity of that last mind moment. An example of that would be a nuclear bomb goes off in the neighborhood and you're dead. And that one mind moment, you're awake, and the next mind moment, there's not even a you anymore

**Speaker B:** there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, that's really being blown away, is completely disintegrated in an explosion. So that can happen, but generally That another one was when people die in their sleep, and so then they don't know. But by and large, Granny, who's going to die in the hospital, knows she's going to die in the hospital. I've seen that many times. I know people who have been with people dying right in front of them, and they say that they know. It's almost like a last breath, like, wow. And that happens a lot, and sometimes it's even verbal in the sense of, I'll see you in

**Speaker B:** hell. Yeah, that's quite the way to go.

**Speaker A:** That's not the best way to end, not the best way out.

**Speaker B:** No, you know, I just wanted to mention before I hop off here, it's getting late, but I yesterday I remember there was like getting to sort of these states of satisfaction that was like very satisfied. It was like, wow, this is like something that, you know, it's like life, we should feel like this more often. It's like, this is why don't we feel this way more often?

**Speaker A:** Wow, this is great as one of the first ones, but later we get into I can do this anytime. Wow, this is so great, and we can do it anytime. That would be nice. Anytime. Wow, this feels so nice, and we can do this anytime. That's the knowledge, real knowledge, that, hey, I can do this. I can feel good anytime. I don't have to feel bad. I can take a deep breath and just relax. And I can do that standing in line. I can do it at the visa office. I can do it while I'm handcuffed in the back of a patrol car. I can do it anywhere.

**Speaker B:** I don't think I'm there quite just

**Speaker A:** yet. Practice, my boy,

**Speaker B:** practice. Yeah, I mean, like that, it was like a really deep, like, sense of like, wow, like, fully okay.

**Speaker A:** You know, yeah, that's the practice, is to get into that state over and over and over again. And eventually thought, Sila, I could do this. I really can. Then we develop that winner's attitude. Yeah, I can handle this.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's what I'm working on.

**Speaker A:** Enjoy. In fact, don't work, play.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, good point, good point. I got to get back to kindergarten here. I was watching your video on

**Speaker A:** that. All right, well, we'll see you later then. All right, interesting talk.

**Speaker B:** Absolutely.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. See you later.

**Speaker B:** Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, primarily led by **Dhammarato (Speaker A)**, is a wide-ranging, informal conversation with **Sangha friends (Speaker B and others)** covering several interconnected themes centered around the spiritual path, practical Dhamma practice, and personal experience.

Here is a structured summary of the key topics discussed:

### **Core Themes**

**1. The Spiritual Urge & Leaving Conventional Life**
*   Dhammarato shares his personal story from the 1960s: despite a lucrative career at IBM and material success, he felt a deep sense that "something's missing" and a desire to "check out" of the conventional world.
*   He emphasizes that the driving force is not money, but **strong determination and the right attitude**—the confidence that you can make the journey and live simply.
*   He contrasts being a **tourist** (following pre-set plans) with being a **traveler** (embracing openness and being a "visitor" or *anicca* in all situations).

**2. Practical Advice for Spiritual Exploration**
*   **"Wat Surfing":** Dhammarato describes his method of low-budget travel, bicycling and staying in monasteries (*wats*) across Thailand and Malaysia. He highlights this as a way to live on the "four requisites" (food, shelter, clothing, medicine).
*   **Starting Locally:** He advises the questioner (a young man in Chicago) to begin by visiting local Thai, Lao, and Cambodian temples. The approach should be gradual—like "courting"—visiting, spending weekends, and eventually integrating into the community. This can be done without immediately quitting one's job.
*   **Overcoming Fear:** A significant part of the journey is confronting the "fear of the unknown," such as staying in unfamiliar or seemingly eerie places (e.g., Lao funeral halls with beds for the deceased). This becomes part of the practice to understand and overcome fear.

**3. The Centrality of Attitude (Right Intention - *Samma Sankappa*)**
*   A major point reiterated throughout is that **attitude is everything** in the Dhamma.
*   The spiritual path is about cultivating an attitude of **satisfaction** (*santutthi*), **freedom**, and **fearlessness**, rather than one of deprivation, rule-following, or striving for future rewards.
*   True power (*iddhi*) is redefined as the "power of feeling safe and secure," the ability to be at ease anywhere.

**4. On Celibacy, Desire, and the Middle Way**
*   In response to a question about a friend considering a long-term celibacy "challenge" (e.g., 500 days) for supposed benefits, Dhammarato offers a nuanced critique:
    *   **Dangers of Forced Abstinence:** Framing celibacy as a rule-based challenge often leads to internal conflict ("I want it, but I can't have it") and eventual failure followed by guilt.
    *   **The Natural Approach:** True freedom from sexual desire comes not from willpower but from **shifting attention to more wholesome, satisfying mental states**. When the mind is content and engaged elsewhere, desire naturally subsides ("out of sight, out of mind").
    *   **Seeing the Danger:** The key to teaching Dhamma, especially on sensitive topics, is not to give rules but to help others **see the dangers (and gratifications)** of their actions for themselves, through skillful questioning. This allows them to find their own escape.

**5. Practical Dhamma Practice: Anapanasati & Daily Life**
*   The discussion turns to the correct practice of **Anapanasati** (mindfulness of breathing).
*   **The Anchor:** The breath (or even the act of picking up one's phone) can be used as an "anchor" to check in: *"Am I satisfied right now? Why am I doing this?"*
*   **Overcoming Doubt:** Dhammarato addresses the practitioner's over-analysis of the "steps" (e.g., "Do I note 'long breath' or 'gladden the mind' first?"). He identifies this perfectionism as **doubt**, a hindrance. The solution is to relax, choose one approach, and simply do it, enjoying the breath.
*   **The Essence:** The core skill is **Sati** (mindfulness)—continuously coming back. The practice is to **"mindfully breathe in/out, training to..."** develop joy (*piti*), pleasure (*sukha*), and other factors. The order is less important than the consistent, joyful return to the breath.
*   **Integrating Practice:** The ultimate goal is to reach a state of satisfaction so accessible that one can access it anywhere, anytime—"standing in line" or even in difficult circumstances—cultivating a "winner's attitude."

**6. The Poison of Unwholesome Input**
*   Using the example of a "slippery slope" from watching wholesome puppy videos to getting agitated by online arguments, the talk highlights how media "concocts" the mind.
*   The advice is to be vigilant about what we feed our minds, as it directly determines our mental state. It's better to "give your mind" only to trusted, wholesome sources.

### **Key Takeaways**
*   The journey begins with a deep-seated urge for meaning, not with a large bank account.
*   The path is about cultivating an **attitude of satisfied freedom**, not one of austere deprivation.
*   Skillful Dhamma practice, especially Anapanasati, is about **joyful, present-moment awareness**, not mechanical perfection of steps.
*   True spiritual power is **fearlessness and contentment**, accessible here and now through mindfulness.
*   The Dhamma is best shared as a gift that helps others see for themselves, not as a set of commands or rules.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this rich and wide-ranging conversation, here is a breakdown of the key metaphors and stories used by the speakers, primarily **Speaker A**.

### **Core Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **Tourist vs. Traveler:** This is a central metaphor for mindset. A **tourist** follows a pre-set, commercialized path (like a guided temple tour), seeking external entertainment. A **traveler** is self-directed, open, and engages deeply with the culture and place, embracing the role of a "visitor" or guest. This maps directly to a spiritual seeker's attitude.

2.  **Road Signs & Sawhorses (for Dhamma Teaching):** Rules and warnings (like "abstain from sex") are compared to **sawhorses or danger signs** placed around a pothole. The teacher can point out the pothole (the danger), but the student must "fall in their own pothole" to truly understand and erect their own internal warning sign. Imposing rules is ineffective; insight must come from within.

3.  **"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" (for Desire):** The old song lyric is used as a metaphor for how intense desire ("when your heart's on fire") clouds judgment and causes suffering ("smoke gets in your eyes... you can't see straight").

4.  **Brylcreem: "A little dab will do you":** This 1960s hair cream slogan becomes a metaphor for the **Middle Way** and contentment (*santutthi*). The Dhamma teaches "just enough"—not deprivation, not excess.

5.  **The Shepherd's Rod & Staff (Psalms 23):** Referenced when discussing spiritual "powers" (*iddhi*). The real power is not supernatural ability but the **fearlessness and security** of a shepherd walking through a dangerous valley, protected by his staff (the Dhamma).

6.  **Torn Bread vs. Sliced Bread (for Relationships/Divorce):** A bad breakup is like bread **torn apart**, ragged and messy. A wise, mindful separation is like bread **sliced cleanly with a knife**. This illustrates the difference between relationships ended with and without wisdom.

7.  **Wat Surfing:** A playful term coined in the dialogue (like "couch surfing") for the practice of traveling and staying in different Buddhist monasteries (*wats*).

8.  **Piano Practice (Arthur Rubinstein):** The story of the pianist who says if he misses one day of practice, he notices; two days, the critics notice; three days, the audience notices. This is an analogy for the **consistent, daily necessity of mindfulness practice**.

### **Key Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **Speaker A's Personal Journey:**
    *   **The IBM Epiphany:** The core story of having a prestigious, high-paying job at IBM in the 1960s, feeling spiritually empty despite material success, and planning a "check-out" with only $5,000. This frames the talk's central theme: determination matters more than money.
    *   **Bicycling & "Wat Surfing" in Asia:** The vivid story of bicycling from Bangkok to Malaysia, sleeping in temples (*wats*) almost every night, living on alms food. This illustrates the "traveler" mindset, frugality, and immersion in practice.
    *   **Confronting Status:** The story of having to humbly receive alms food (sometimes half-eaten) from poor villagers, confronting and overcoming his own ingrained sense of status and superiority from his IBM identity.

2.  **Stories of Place & Culture:**
    *   **The Abandoned Wat (Wat Phang Boa):** The story of an abandoned, crumbling monastery on Koh Samui, now inside an airport fence. Used to illustrate impermanence and the idea of seeking out "scary" or solitary places for practice.
    *   **The Lao "Funeral Bed" Hall:** A detailed, slightly macabre story about Lao temples in the U.S. that have large halls filled with beds, each holding funeral offerings and urns for the deceased lay community. Told as an ultimate test for confronting and understanding fear.
    *   **"Lao Food as a Perpetual Student":** Anecdotes about elderly Lao women in the U.S. preparing extremely authentic, sometimes bizarre (to a Western palate) foods at temple festivals, representing the deep preservation of culture and the speaker's attitude as a perpetual learner.

3.  **Stories to Illustrate Dhamma Points:**
    *   **The Monk at the Fair:** A reference to a Vinaya story where monks collecting alms at a festival were seen as a bother. This explains the monastic rule about "wrong time" for alms—it's about context and not being a nuisance, not just the clock.
    *   **The Hobo "Internet" of the 1930s:** A story about hobos leaving chalk marks on houses to signal kindness or danger to others. This connects the "wanderlust" of spiritual travel to a historical American archetype and contrasts it with modern homelessness.
    *   **The Cartoon Hobo:** Referencing the classic image of a wanderer with a stick and bandana bundle, tying the spiritual journey to a universal, almost romantic archetype of adventure and freedom.

4.  **Stories for Humor & Caution:**
    *   **The Celibate Priest Flying Away:** A humorous image of a priest marking off 5,000 days of celibacy on a calendar, expecting superpowers, and finally sprouting wings to fly away—used to critique the "transactional" view of renunciation.
    *   **Viagra for Old Men vs. Young Men's Problems:** An ironic observation that young men seek celibacy to quiet desire, while old men take pills to stimulate it, highlighting that the issue is one of **attitude and mental obsession**, not the physical act itself.

### **Overarching Narrative Metaphors**
*   **The Spiritual Journey as Pilgrimage/Wanderlust:** The entire conversation is framed by this ancient metaphor. The path is physical travel, internal exploration, and moving from "holy site" (temple, teaching) to "holy site."
*   **From "City Boy" to "Traveler":** The dialogue with Speaker B acts as a microcosm of this journey, with Speaker A mentoring him from a mindset of fear and planning ("city boy") toward one of openness, simplicity, and courage.

In summary, Speaker A uses a tapestry of **personal autobiography, cultural anecdotes, humorous images, and classic analogies** to convey that the spiritual path is about **a fundamental shift in attitude**—from accumulation to contentment, from fear to fearlessness, from being a passive tourist in life to an engaged, mindful traveler.
