### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So.

**Speaker B:** My friend, I always like to meet people who have been already, let us say, coming after they already know about Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, that you probably also are familiar with the fact that he has been quite a revolution in Thailand over the past 60, 70 years. And basically what that means is that he has let the real Dharma, the supermundane Dharma, the actual Dharma that works, he's let that out of the bag. Cat out of the bag, okay, and to make it public. And so, um, this quality of letting things be public— by the way, why don't you go ahead and turn your microphone off so that, uh, uh, we don't have a lot of extra noise? Okay, uh, if you want to talk, go ahead and turn it back on. Okay, so Good, Michael. So starting off with Bhikkhu Buddhadasa is actually a very good place to begin. But often there's so much happening in the retreats that many of the students miss some of the key points because they're, let us say, finding and falling in love again with all the things they already believed were true in the first place. This is called confirmation bias or projection, right? And sometimes some of the really important stuff gets slipped right by because it didn't make any impact on us, or let us say that we didn't gain much of any kind of insight. Into that. Okay, so going back over then the actual practice of Anapanasati and kind of filling in some of the gaps for you would be quite valuable. And the place always that we begin is with the teaching of the Buddha that the only thing that he taught was Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. The Buddha didn't teach anything about attainments. He didn't teach Jhana. He didn't teach rebirth, reincarnation, magical powers. He didn't teach any of that stuff, and he admitted so, okay, that he didn't even teach annihilationism. Which was what he was most accused of. What is annihilation of? In the Suttas it says, upon the breakup of the body, the existing being is annihilated. When you're dead, you're dead. You're alive and then you're dead, right? And the Buddha does not teach that either. Nor does he even teach all about Anatta. That what he really teaches is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, to come out. Now most of the Westerners have the idea that, oh, that means that I've got to go look at the dukkha, dukkha, dukkha, dukkha, here's dukkha, that dukkha's, uh, that dukkha's connected with this dukkha, let's go down this dukkha rabbit hole for miles, right? But the Buddha didn't teach that. He taught Dukkha, Dukkha Nirodha, to see the Dukkha. And the better at seeing it for what it is, the easier it is to come out of. And that's the third noble truth, is that we can come out of this once we see the cause of it. And the cause is actually manufactured in the mind. So in a way, what we can say is that there are three actual kinds of people that have three different actual kinds of doubt, and that as the doubts are eradicated, we can come to the Dhamma. Okay, and the first doubt is, who can I get to help me? Where is my mommy? Where is my authority? Which rules do I follow? What am I supposed to do? Right? This is actually all wrapped up with Sila, Bhante, Paramasa, which I don't know if you've heard that word before. It's attachments to the way that things are supposed to be and the people who set them up. Okay? And so in our culture and society, we do that with gurus, We do that with psychologists, medical doctors, "Please be my mentor, be my daddy, tell me what to do." And that's the first doubt that keeps people at an ordinary level, because they never will find that authority, it doesn't exist, and in a way, it cannot exist. Because nobody can see what's inside your mind, only you can do that. And that's where the responsibility comes, that's actually now the Second Noble Truth, is all the crap comes from within. It's our own stupidity, our own greed, our own ill will, and when we can see that in operation, we can make a change. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was really big on change. Did you hear that word at the retreat at all? Change?

**Speaker A:** Um, I'm not sure if I remember hearing about change specifically. I mean, Tanha, Anagami gave most of the Dhamma talks, and he talked a lot about Dukkha, and he talked a lot about— oh yeah, change, Anicca. Okay, of course I did hear about change. What am I saying?

**Speaker B:** Okay, right.

**Speaker A:** For some reason it didn't click when you said it as like impermanence But yeah, definitely.

**Speaker B:** Right? Exactly.

**Speaker A:** You're probably thinking, what is he talking about?

**Speaker B:** Okay, so this is what I was mentioning before, is some of the most important things that are said. Slip-right bias. And now I'm bringing it up to kind of wakey-wakey. Okay, the whole teaching of the Buddha is about changing the Second Noble Truth around so that we can get into the Third Noble Truth, that we can in fact be free from the Dukkha. Now the way that we would define Dukkha would be dissatisfaction. So if we can get ourselves into a state of satisfaction, then that's it. It's an easy thing to do, is to just get yourself into a state of satisfaction. That's the only thing that the Buddha was ever trying to teach in the first place, is let's get satisfied. And what does that mean? It means being okay with the way things actually are without having to fix it. But our whole culture teaches us that we've got to fix whatever is broken, and we— and there's a whole lot of stuff broken. Some people think the society is going uphill, but not half fast enough and not high enough. Other people think that the thing is broken down and they want to destroy it, and all kinds of stuff. And you've got so many different wars going on, both outside in the society and each one of those people within. We don't like, we're dissatisfied. And we often think that if I can get what I want, then I'll be satisfied. And so we go around wanting things that we don't have. That's the real Dukkha, is it? And basically ignorantly not even aware that it's the fact that you're wanting something, pining something, can't get what you want, that makes you feel bad. Actually, it's almost like if I don't have what I want, I see it, I like it, and because I like it, I want to keep it. I want it to be around often so that I can look at it again and like it again, because I really like looking at it. Whatever it is—girlfriend or a painting or $100 bill—whatever it is that I like looking at, I want to keep it around. So I can like it again, right? Well, if that's the case, then that means that I've got to go get it. I'm not good enough without it. I'm not good enough without it. I can only be good enough, and therefore complete enough, and therefore satisfied enough, if I have that $100 bill, or that house, or that girl, or that car, or whatever it is that's my heart's desire right now. Guess what? All we have to do is to stop wanting stuff, or more wisely, only want the things that are easily available. Now, that's profound. Think about it. Go ahead.

**Speaker A:** I wanted to see if I can express some of my personal delusions and see what you think. You know, having at this point in my practice, I don't really want too many worldly things anymore, except for the occasional, oh, if I could just go back to Thailand, if I could just go back to Wat Suwan Mook, I'll be able to get back into the stream and all that. I do get caught in that sometimes. But the wanting that I find myself with at the moment, besides the unconscious bad habits of, like I said, going to eat and watch TV constantly, that just gets in the way of my mental health is like, to be frank, is like, I want to make contact with the Nibbana element. Like, I want like the full— Exactly. Explosive. Yes.

**Speaker B:** Way beyond stream entry. This is what I was getting at. Okay, so now we know. In other words, got you.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Okay, that look that you're not good enough because you don't have what you need or want. You think you'd be better off with this Nibbana, and that whole thing is in your mind, is concoction. Just like Sati, Karuna, and Arhat, Dhamma, Vipassana talk about, these are the concoctions. You have concocted a Nibbana in your mind, and now you lust after it. And that's why you're dissatisfied, thinking that you will be okay and satisfied when you have that. This is the basic teaching now. This is taught in Zen. You're already enlightened, they say. Tathagata is to be here now. You're good enough right now. Let go of all of these desires. See that that's painful. Wanting spiritual attainments is painful. It's called spiritual materialism, and I have not met a student yet who isn't deeply infected with that. Okay, go ahead.

**Speaker A:** So, you know how I'm a bit technical. I actually wrote a thesis on Ajahn Buddhadasa, so some of my questions might be a little technical.

**Speaker B:** But I'll get you out of that soon enough.

**Speaker A:** Well, what I've always appreciated about Buddha's teachings is some of it is what you're talking about, like that immediately effective, apparent, here and now Dhamma, but like the criteria for measuring awakening by basically the absence of the defilements, of the taints, of the asavas, things like that. So even though conceptually I understand that wanting to go through Jhana have an insight into, you know, the constructed nature of myself that gives me these insights that lifts the suffering off for a while before it comes back and the habits come back. Even though I know conceptually that like wanting that itself is the opposite of Nibbana because it's wanting some attainment. When I'm not practicing, when I'm not doing Anapanasati for 2 hours, 3 times a day, so 6 hours a day, then my mind is filled with defilement. It's filled with craving. It's filled with old habits of delusion. So I guess my question for you is, and for me, for that reason, I've always taken personally, taken issue with the idea that I'm already enlightened because the mind is filled with all these impurities and there's a way to get rid of it. So I guess the question is, How do I balance the idea that I'm already satisfied, I'm already awakened here and now, and the fact that the mind still has these habits that cause Dukkha, these different forms of defilement?

**Speaker B:** All right, let us say it this way. I can give you short answers. The shortest answer I can give is because you're not changing. The whole point is we got to change, and you're not changing. Okay, number 2 is that of course you're going to ask that question. That's where all of this has been leading in anyway. You're just a step ahead of me, that's all. You're asking the question about, you know, you're stopping in the middle of the book on chapter 3 saying, well, What's in Chapter 4? Okay, well, we'll get to Chapter 4. We're on our way, in fact, we're right into it. Okay, that in fact, going back to where we were, Chapter 3, about coming out of the Dukkha right here, right now, waking up or seeing things clearly is the end, the eradication of, or the opposite of the ignorance that keeps us caught in wanting things we don't have, like spiritual attainments, Jhanas, Nibbana, and all of that kind of stuff. It's almost like standing at the foot of a ladder wishing you were on the roof. And in fact, there is actually one step at a time, if you'll take it like that. And the fact is, is that at the retreat you missed a few rungs along the way. And so now you're trying to figure out where those rungs were that you missed so that you can climb that ladder again. Okay, but so long as you're standing at the bottom of the ladder pining for— then we're not going to get anywhere. And the state that I'm talking about right here is the state of, let us say, 90% of all of the people. This goes back to what I was saying about who am I going to get to fix me, and the answer to that is nobody's going to do it. So now the second doubt comes: am I up to the task? Am I up to it? Can I do it? Do I have the mojo? Do I have the success? Am I going to pass the test, etc.? What test? The test that I set up consciously, wisely, rather than ignorantly. Okay, so this is the whole idea again. So let's go from the first, second, and third noble truth. The second Truth is that we are responsible for all the crap, because we made it in the first place. We changed it from infancy into childhood, and then we changed it from childhood into a brat, and then eventually into adulthood that's still kind of a brat inside. So, we have been able to change, let's continue to do that. Let's in fact, in a way, grow, actually grow up. To grow up to be completely mature, which means when we were a child, we played with childish things, and now that I'm an adult, I put away those childish toys. This, by the way, is out of the Bible. That's one of the things that Paul got away with, is that statement. And he was talking about it at that emotional level. Like wanting things that we don't have, like inventing toys like Nibbana or Jhanas or whatever things like that, inventing those things in our mind and then wanting them. Like some emperors in the old days, they wanted eternal life, and wow, did they go through a whole lot of trouble. Many of them actually accidentally killed themselves trying to take medicines they designed to make them live long. Okay, now that's ignorance for you. Okay, so we go into now in this teaching from the Eightfold into the Eightfold Noble Path. In fact, in the time of the Buddha, it did not have that kind of connotation, or certainly not that language. The 8, in fact, is there and evident in the suttas but it was never listed like that. Just like you probably heard about 8 jhanas, where in fact there's only listed 4. And then some suttas, there's 9 if you count them the way that they counted up to 8. So this is actually a bunch of abstractions that people are putting on to things when we're actually talking about natural events. Natural events that happen naturally when we set things up like that, that we have to make decisions, we have to make changes about which direction we're going. And so in the Eightfold Noble Path, everything starts with right view. Right view starts first, and that right noble view is different and that we actually have to have a bit of Right Noble View to ever really get into practice anyway, that we know in fact enough about Dukkha, we just don't know how to get out of it. And that's where we have to bring the viewing into the present moment, rather than the view of there is Dukkha out there and it comes by from time to time, into, are we on guard so if it comes right now, I can see it right now. This is what Sati is all about, which works with it. The Sati then is to wake up and take a look at what you're thinking about. Wake up and take a look. Now you were doing a lot of that at the retreat. That's part of what they talk about, is to wake up and take a look. And then number 3, is right noble effort to make a change, to make a change from unwholesome thoughts to wholesome thoughts. This is actually a fairly easy thing to do, but it needs to be done over and over and over again, because at any particular moment you'll be triggered back into unwholesome thoughts. Can you catch those? And so long sitting meditations actually is not necessarily advantageous for being able to see Dukkha. We can get ourselves into happy states, but the question is, are we going to live our lives? Is your goal to wind up sitting in some forest monastery in Thailand or in Burma, and sitting on the floor in that small temple for 14 hours a day, 16 hours a day, maybe sit there and sleep? Is that what your plan is? I haven't met anybody who has that plan, but I've certainly seen guys who are like that. The Asians can get really into this stuff. So the question is, is he sitting there wanting something just like you? Or is he sitting there comfortably and happy because he's got any and everything that he wants? Or is he sitting there in some deep, some non-dualistic trance that would be, by some imagination, some high Jhana, to where the reality is, is he's just dull, asleep? So I'm glad that you're telling me that in fact that you don't want to in fact live like that, that you actually want to be alive and to live, because this is something that actually I used to.

**Speaker A:** Right? That is what you described used to be my aspiration, um, but it's not anymore.

**Speaker B:** Oh, so you had an insight.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Well, actually, you described perfectly the reason why my mind changed. I could see that Michael sitting in a forest monastery in Thailand would probably be just as dissatisfied as Michael sitting at home here, that the difference isn't going— it's the same delusion as any other delusion. I thought to myself, like, there's another aspiration I have, which is to have a homestead in the mountains, in the forest. And I tell myself, if I get that homestead, then I'll be able to do my practice, I'll be at peace. Well, you know, those are just two versions of the same habit I have, which is to create a fictional place where I'm perfectly peaceful and experiencing Nibbana 24 hours a day.

**Speaker B:** And yes, and guess what, in the regard of how we're speaking, those That whole train of thought is unwholesome, and it's planning for the future, not living in the present moment. And that's very common. Everybody does it because we're taught to do that as children. We're asked stupid questions like, "What are you going to be when you grow up?" rather than asking the child, "What are you right now?" And so we get into that habit of always continuing to grow up into some new future, which marks us as some sort of child today. But when we come to the point of living in the present moment, that's when we're fully alive. We've got no future. All we've got is everything right now. We need to practice doing that because we're already well-practiced at thinking about the future. So change means to change those thoughts from unwholesome thoughts to wholesome thoughts. One wholesome thought after another after another. When your mind is in a state where you're having one wholesome thought after another, after another, that's actually then the definition of first Jhana, along with several other factors. In fact, the word Samadhi is referred to for the first Jhana because we're actually bringing several factors together. Samadhi does not mean concentration. This is one of the most important teachings that I can give you is because we're here to wake up. Bodhi, to be awake, to be alert, to be alive, not somnambulistic, off in some dull meditative state, which seems to be the way that everybody wants to go because they think that there's going to be a light at the end of some dark tunnel that they've gone into. Something like after the end of the dark night of the soul or something.

**Speaker A:** I feel you can, you can get that from taking heroin, you know, or opiates if you want to, like, get.

**Speaker B:** Yourself into a really bad state doing various things, including the wrong kind of meditation.

**Speaker A:** I mean, like, with that type of, that type of, like, like using meditation to get high, basically, to get into like a, like a dull trance. I was like, if that's your goal, you might as well you know, just take drugs, you know. I mean, probably more consequential with the drugs, but, um, it seems, it seems to be a similar driver.

**Speaker B:** Um, exactly. Okay, so the story then is, is that the new young Zen monk goes into the temple and there's his teacher, teacher just sitting there, and the young monk goes up and he says, Master, Master, Are you meditating in order to become enlightened? The master opened one eye and says, I'm not meditating because I don't need to be enlightened. Okay, don't need anything, that we're satisfied, everything is already hunky-dory. Okay. But the thoughts that we have are planning thoughts, thoughts that things are not hunky-dory, we've got to fix this broken thing, rather than relishing the fact that everything is already okay. In other words, we're intentionally having unwholesome fixing-it thoughts rather than wholesome 'it's already okay' Thoughts. Now, I'm actually referencing Sutta number 117, where the Buddha uses the term unwholesome thoughts. Also, we use— Sutta number 19 has two kinds of thoughts, wholesome and unwholesome, and it gives definitions for those. In the Anapanasati Sutta, it uses a slightly different language. What was the language that it used to say in the Anapanasati Sutta? Is to gladden the mind. You've probably heard that one before, to gladden the mind, right? Right by you. Because gladdening the mind is in fact to change that we need to make. All right, now we actually make a kind of a little distinction, but it's not important, but there's a difference between gladdening the mind by using the words versus brightening the mind or gladdening the mind in the state of mind that we're in. So if the mind is dull, we can make it sharp, we can make it bright, we can wake it up. As well as talking ourselves into having the kind of thoughts that are worthwhile having right now. And so in having kind of thoughts of, oh no, it's still 30 minutes before that bell rings, we can have the hot, hot dog. I've got another 30 minutes to sit here and do absolutely nothing. So this is the distinction then between gladdening the mind versus doing something that has a lot of thoughts about what we want. That in fact, having spiritual and mystical experiences is a dead hindrance or deadly. It's a deadly hindrance. Why? Because we begin to want something before we didn't want. Now that we've had that experience, I want that again. I've had that ice cream, I want more. Okay, and guess what? We didn't get it the first time by wanting it. But now that we want it, can't get no satisfaction when we want it. What we have to do instead is practice being satisfied.

**Speaker A:** There's sort of an irony with me, and is that the peak— and now I'm talking about the past— but you know, in the peak of that practice that I continued after Swamiji. The recurring thought I had was.

**Speaker B:** That.

**Speaker A:** There'S nothing to do, there's nowhere to go, and there's nothing to say. And I started to perceive Buddhism as a cure for religious aspiration. Like that, you know, I had these— I didn't tell you about the— you know, I didn't go back this far, but I had these mystical experiences when I was 15, and that created, like you said, I had a want for that. And then it felt like that was the biggest fire in me that was cooled after Swan Book. And it felt like to move my body instead of my body moving itself towards hunger or towards hurrying towards some craving, it felt like there was nothing moving my body. So for me to do anything, I had to choose to do it. So I felt completely I felt like I had complete agency. And it was just like this absence of having anything to say or having any desire. So the irony now is that I'm aspiring for that again, which is the opposite of what that was because there was no fire in me. It was just coolness all the time. And I'm constantly trying to get back to that. But I know in my mind intellectually that that trying to get back to it is craving, is being dissatisfied. But I haven't been able to crack.

**Speaker B:** My own code for— All right, listen carefully. Listen carefully because I actually have already given you the code. At least the first 4 digits of the combination, the first 3 digits, okay? You have to go back to remembering to be here now, to wake up and look at what the mind is doing, and then with discernment decide whether you can improve it or not. Then you make a decision to improve it which means you're taking actually the effort, actual effort, that I'm going to come out of wanting Nibbana and be okay without it. I can be fine. I'm okay. Now there's something else along with that, and that is that whenever we're practicing, naturally I think that you know this, or at least you agree intellectually, that we want to have the body in a safe place. We do not want to practice Anapanasati sitting on the railroad tracks, nor at the police station. All right, maybe in a hospital when we really need it after we will skill, but we don't go into Anapanasati to practice Anapanasati at the beginning when we're already laid up in the hospital, it's too late. Okay, why? Because those places are all dangerous. We need to get the body into a state of relaxation. That, in fact, that's what step 4 is in Anapanasati, is getting the body relaxed. How we're going to do that with the relaxing the body is first off getting into the safe secure and comfortable environment. Safe, secure, comfortable. Remember those three words, because getting the body safe, secure, and comfortable is exactly what we are also doing with the mind. In fact, by talking ourselves into getting the body safe, secure, and comfortable, both as we are sitting down and then when we are sitting down, we already get the mind into a state of safe, secure, and comfortable. Anagami, the mind— no place to go, nothing to do, everything is okay, everything is safe, everything is all right. This is what will bring on the feeling of, yeah, everything is okay, everything's all right, a state of satisfaction. And that satisfaction now, surprise, surprise, is exactly opposite of Dukkha. When we can get ourselves into a state of satisfaction that we can't have any fear, we can't have any dissatisfactions, we can't have any discomforts, we remove those things intentionally. How? By changing the kind of thoughts that we were having before. And we do this over and over and over again. This is actually more Buddhist teaching about the Eightfold Noble Path and the first three items: Samadhi, Samma Sati, and Samma Viriya. And now we're going to talk about the fourth item, Samma Sanghappa. Which is almost always translated wrongly as wrong thought, but the better translation is right intention. And I'm giving you a new definition for the word right attitude. Okay, why? Because if we continue to get ourselves into a state of satisfaction over and over and over again, doesn't that feel a little successful? Yeah, and we begin to get the attitude, I can clean out the mind, I can do it, I can take the right effort and throw these hindrances out. And that gives us the feeling of being a winner. And when that grows into maturity, we become Anagami, completely self-confident. Why? Because we know we can handle anything, which is another way of saying I don't give a flying rip about anything. Why? Because I'm smart enough to not cling and grasp to anything or to carry anything around. So in fact, in this way, we're also understanding that the teaching of Paticcasamuppada, which you were introduced to. Okay, Paticcasamuppada is about when we cling to things, that's the real Dukkha. If we don't care, then there's nothing there. And so we keep practicing this way, and over and over again we get that confidence growing. That mojo, "I can do this, I can handle this." And then there comes a point when that confidence, that Shraddha, is strong enough that we can say, "It does not matter what happens, does not matter what kind of hindrances come into the mind, whatever obstructions it might be, I can throw that stuff right out. I can throw that stuff right out and see reality as it is right here, right now. Now, this statement that the Buddha said is noble. It is supermundane. It is a factor of the path, and it's not held by ordinary people. Ordinary people are still struck in point of 'Help me, Daddy.' And this is beyond even that second doubt of 'Am I up to it?' Because we've got the answer: dang tootin', I'm up to it! You got it, buddy, you got it! This is the whole point, is that we can in fact control the mind. We can get it to the point of having one wholesome thought after another after another, condition it into the feelings of safe, secure, comfortable, satisfied, and successful. And now we've actually talked about Sukkha, which is part of the Anapanasati Sutra, to develop this as a skill. And then the satisfaction itself leads to success. And that's the Piti, the feeling of wow, being on top of the world. In fact, one of my students said one time that it's commonly known, or at least in some quarters, some famous person said that every one of us is an emperor of our own pile of dirt. Now actually what the dirt is there, it's our old rubbish. That's the Sankhara. Achan Dhammarato is so on about the Samskara. Every one of us is an emperor of our own pile of dirt, except.

**Speaker A:** We are underneath the dirt and we think somebody else buried us.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. So the attitude is, are we going to be on top of the world? Are we going to be on top of vermilion pile of dirt, or you're going to get buried under it.

**Speaker A:** Reminds me of the— I don't remember where the story came from, but the story about the sandwich. You might have heard of it. There's a man who goes to work every day and he complains, oh, I got a ham sandwich. And then the next day he goes to work and he's like, oh, another ham sandwich. And it goes on and on and on every day. At lunch he's hanging out with his coworkers, he's like, ham sandwich again. And finally, like, after about 3 weeks, his coworkers say Hey, why don't you just ask your wife to make you a different sandwich? And he goes, huh? I'm not married. I make my own sandwiches. Yeah, so it's the same idea. It's like, like I'm complaining about this Dukkha that I'm making for myself, you know.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. That's a good one. I like that. The ham sandwich.

**Speaker A:** And ourselves.

**Speaker B:** Okay. So that means now if we can change that we can come out from under our own pile of dirt that we're buried in. We can claw our way to the top of it, because that's where you were. Or we can just simply sit on top of the world. It's a mental attitude. Are you going to be on top of your world? Are you going to try to claw your way to the top? Are you going to be dissatisfied being in the bottom?

**Speaker A:** I'm not sure to answer that. I'm trying not to skip ahead because that is my habit. I actually heard one of your talks where you talked about the drivers, and I'm definitely a hurry-up and a perfectionist, but the hurry-up is very dominant. But the question that keeps coming to mind is I love how you describe Jhana as one wholesome thought after another. Of course, with the Jhana factors, the various Jhana factors relative to what Jhana you're in as well. And when my practice is, when I'm doing it, I've had times where I've just been in that stream of one wholesome thought after another, just that state of there's nowhere to go, there's nothing to do. There's nothing to say. Everything is exactly right. I could feel my body from head to toe. I couldn't get angry if you stuck a knife in my arm. I'm so, you know, good, you know.

**Speaker B:** All right, so why don't you practice that instead of wanting it? Yeah, so.

**Speaker A:** I should. Yeah, I got— like my dad said, I have nothing but excuses. But, um, not about Buddhism, but about other things in my life. But so where I'm getting to is.

**Speaker B:** The Dhamma is Everywhere, everything is Dhamma.

**Speaker A:** So what I'm getting to in my question, and maybe the question will just be another expression of the same problem, but you know how the Buddhist path is often summarized as abandoning the unwholesome, cultivating the wholesome, and purifying the mind? I'm trying to get to the purify the mind part because I feel that the conceit The conceit, and just, I have so many ways that I fool myself.

**Speaker B:** When you have the Western mentality, the thought you're living in the future again, by the way, okay. And that's the mistake, is that we think that we got to get rid of something. We think that it's going to happen in the future. If I'm a good boy now and do the right thing, then soon I'll have relief. And all you have to do is say, aha, I see that thought, and I don't have to figure that out right now. Right now I'm okay, I'm satisfied.

**Speaker A:** I guess I'm looking for like a guarantee that I won't fool myself again, because I fool myself.

**Speaker B:** You can have that guarantee, and you are the one who's going to have to write that ham sandwich. Okay, you can have guarantee. That's what we mean by having that mojo, having that lion. You work up to it. You get one success after another after another until they pile up like trophies in the mind, because that's a whole lot better Sankhara to have than the crap that you're carrying around now. And that's basically what we're talking about. We can't get rid of the sankhara, but what we can do is we can put a whole lot of wholesome things in there. Or as one of the talks that I had, the DJ really loved it when I started talking about put hamburgers on your sewer. If you only put one hamburger in it, the sewer is going to eat that hamburger. You don't want that hamburger. But if you've got a layer of hamburgers 10 feet deep Then you don't even have to worry about the fact that there's a sewer under there. You got all the pile of hamburgers you want right here. Okay, so that's the way of looking at it, is that we've got to pile up a whole bunch of happy thoughts, a whole lot of wholesome thoughts, so that they become readily available to us. Okay, change the habits. One dog at a time.

**Speaker A:** There's a fear of myself, like there's this like other part of my personality that just like fools me into going back into the habits. When I reach that level of practice where everything is perfect, there's always a voice that comes into my head and.

**Speaker B:** Says like, take a deep breath and tell yourself right now everything is perfect. Go ahead, do it right now. Let things be perfect right now. Everything is all right. Everything's fine.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I'll just keep doing that instead of, you know, convincing myself at all for myself.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. Stop thinking about the future and recognize that right now is just fine.

**Speaker A:** What do you recommend for, for like sitting Anapanasati practice? 'Cause the way you're talking right now is, I think, a really beautiful way of bringing it into daily life. And then of course that'll make the sitting better. But of course that's like the most important thing is the daily life stuff.

**Speaker B:** But— No, let me put it this way. I'm going to give you the 3 Ps. Do it early. That is practice, performance, and play. You have to practice that. In fact, the Dharma is very, very much like a whole lot of different skills. One example would be becoming a musician, learning to play music. The kid has to practice, okay? He's got to practice. If he's going to take music lessons, the teacher's going to tell him, you got to sit down and practice 30 minutes a day or an hour a day. You got to practice. When the kid's doing that, he doesn't want Mama in the room. He wants to do that alone, so that he can experiment with his instrument. But the most important quality of it is he's got to actually enjoy his practice time, getting something of benefit out of it. Because if your practice is dry, then you'll quit, just like almost all piano students they quit before they ever get anywhere with it. After 2 or 3 years, they're gone. Okay, so we got to get the joy out of it. There's a whole lot of people who practice dryly in the sense that they keep wanting what you want. They get a good experience and then they lust after that experience 6 hours a day, every day for years, until someone like me comes by and front some on that, okay? Very, very dedicated meditators really up themselves off it about how many hours they put in, how good they are at sitting still, And what kind of rinpoche or whatever titles that they've gotten before. So the whole idea then is to come out of that mentality and get benefit out of your practice, to actually take the right effort, breathing one after another. You already know how to do this now that I've given you this expression of it. Okay, you keep remembering that you can change your mind, you can get your body comfortable and relaxed, that in fact the relaxed body is one of the factors of the Jhana in some of the suttas. In others, they only have 5 factors, and I've only talked about 4 of them so far. And the last 2, besides getting the hindrances out of the mind, getting one wholesome thought after another, after another, with the Sukkha of safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. And then the Piti comes in with the success. The championship. I got it, I know it. And then that grows into, I can do this anytime I want to, all I have to do is remember. And I can remember. Okay, so that's that confidence that grows. So with that, the way that we get into this is with the applied and sustained thought. We have to keep coming back to this and keep coming back and keep coming back and keep coming back. That in fact, one of the ways that I speak about it is the entire Dhamma is written on the back of every shampoo bottle at 7-Eleven. Have you heard that joke?

**Speaker A:** I heard you say it in one of your talks, and I definitely laughed hysterically, and I was like, that's it, that's the Buddhist teaching, rinse and repeat.

**Speaker B:** Rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat.

**Speaker A:** And I thought to myself, purify the mind and purify the mind and purify the mind.

**Speaker B:** Okay, exactly. And what do we mean here in this regard? To remove unwholesome thoughts, to remove that unwholesome thought, thoughts about the future, thoughts about the past, thoughts about someplace else, thoughts about wanting things, thoughts about, um, thoughts about wanting something out of the Dharma. But a wholesome thought would be going over the aspects of the Dharma, like a rehearsal, or like a sutta, or like a chant, that you would go over and over and over the Dharma, because what else have we got to think about? This is the really good stuff. Thinking about the Four Noble Truths, that's good things to think about. Thinking about the Anapanasati Sutta, that's good things to think about. Thinking about the Eightfold Noble Path, What, how is my Sati, how is my ability to see, how is my effort going? I got some effort, got some mojo. Okay, so this is in fact the kind of stuff that we want to evaluate at any point in time, but the best time to do it is when we're already in the first Jhana. You see, one of the interesting things about first Jhana is that whatever we notice is always wholesome, is always real. It's not made up, a bunch of crap, or by definition we're not in First Jhana, we're back into hindrances. Okay, so that means now that the investigation that we're going to be doing is the real jail, the real thing. Um, how is my investigation? Can I keep coming back? Can, can I sustain this? And we look at that. That's the applied and sustained thought that we're looking for, is actually remembering to apply and sustain the mind. It's kind of a tight little circle there, but Sati is to wake up to Sati. That's why we talk about Sati and also with Right Noble View, to remember to look. Is all wrapped together into one little thing. So, this is how we're going to practice with the bringing the wholesome thoughts, because we keep looking at how we're doing, what's happening in the mind, investigate, talking to ourselves about the breath, talking to ourselves in fact about what sensory input input that's coming. And also we talk to ourselves about how we feel. Okay, so in fact, by talking to ourselves about the Satipatthana— this body, this set of feelings, these thoughts, this condition of the mind— is all very wholesome kind of thoughts to think about as it really is right now. As opposed to what you were doing was, oh, this body will be better off, these feelings will be better off if I get this, that, and the other thing. Instead of examining how things are right now, because right now they are good enough, they're satisfying enough. And in that regard, we've already gotten enough information to practice correctly, so we don't even have to deal with doubts about what to do, or what I don't know, or what is Nibbana, or what is First John. I don't care what all of those things are. That's what we— that's, you know, throwing that stuff out, dropping it, relinquishing it. I don't care what First John is. I don't I don't care what Nibbana is, I'm having too much fun right now playing with my own mind. That's the way that we practice Anapanasati, and the Anapanasati Sutta itself is geared around getting the mind into the first Jhana, so that we can continue to investigate, but now the only things we find are wholesome. So we can investigate Sati, we can investigate investigating, we can investigate Piti, or how good can I feel? Let yourself feel, I mean just experiment, how good can you feel? And while you're experimenting with how good, what are your peaks of good feeling, that's the second Jhana. And then how good can I feel just hanging out would be like the third jhana. And so we investigate that, we pay a whole lot of attention to being satisfied, pay a whole lot of attention to feeling really good. But in the beginning, we pay a whole lot of attention of, am I paying attention?

**Speaker A:** How about when we get to the point where we've had a lot of insight into the uncertainty of feeling and wanting to go beyond feeling, if that makes sense?

**Speaker B:** Well, that's still wanting to something.

**Speaker A:** You still want to something. Not trusting the feeling, I guess I could say.

**Speaker B:** We actually have to be able to develop them and control them. If you can't control your feelings, you can't stomp them out. It's true, because you have to be able to go to the highs rather than say, I'm just going to stop the lows.

**Speaker A:** I think you're right about trying to skip like 10 rungs on the ladder and get to the roof, because I've seen the roof and I'm like, all right, I'm just going to jump over the ladder to the roof since I know what's up there.

**Speaker B:** Wanting something that you don't have instead of enjoying the second rung of the ladder. Because now you're 2 feet off the ground, what do you do?

**Speaker A:** You fall down very quickly.

**Speaker B:** Well, learning to be satisfied is the process. You have to actually learn to be satisfied by practicing being satisfied. You don't learn to be satisfied by practicing being dissatisfied, it doesn't happen.

**Speaker A:** That's a good point. Yeah, well said. I think I caught practice and play in what you were saying, but I think I missed performance.

**Speaker B:** Well, exactly. In fact, that's okay. Think about the musical student who is in the recital, and they have been practicing piano for 2 years and been practicing this one piece of music for a year, and that little kid walks out on the stage and she sees all of the mommies and the daddies and she gets terrified, but she gets her mojo up. I know this piece of music, and she sits down and she carefully plays that piece of music the way that she knows exactly how to do it. That's performance, okay? And we need to learn to perform the Dharma when we're in public. We need to play, we need to practice it on our own, but when we're in public, we perform. Now, when we've performed so many times that we know that piece of music, just what they say, by heart, but I'm talking about not by heart, but by bones, that's how deep the music will go. The example that I have is this guy is working at a piano bar back in the 1950s, where the bar has a piano and he's there playing, he's got a repertoire of about 200 pieces of music. And a woman in an evening gown comes and leans on the piano and starts to talk to him, and he looks at her and he has the conversation with her, and he doesn't miss a note. And then the story goes on is that then Joe Friday, the detective cops walk in and interrogate this guy while he's playing the piano, and he's paying attention to them, and he's letting them do this interrogation, and he's answering their questions as best he can, and he doesn't miss a note. Okay, that's play, is when it's deep into the bones. And you can see some musicians, especially those who like a piano concerto, that the first time they played in public, they don't play it, they perform it. They got to watch every note. They're students. The whole audience knows their students are listening for every possible mistake. Okay, but if he's played that same piece of music 15 times or over 15 years at various concerts, he's going to walk out on that stage and he's not going to miss a note because he's got every one of them right into the bones, and he's just enjoying that thing. Because he's actually more paying attention to the reaction of the audience than the rest of the musicians. And he's not worried about the music, the most difficult music in the world, and he's able to just play with it. You got your mute.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] I said, I really like that analogy, because two understandings come into my mind. The first is, like, like sort of levels of success. Like, first I'm a piano student. I'm sort of like a kid who's being taught to play piano, and I gotta practice, practice, practice, practice, practice. And then I am good enough to perform that practice at a recital. But at the highest level, I'm like that, like, jazz musician who can just like be freewheeling, just let it rip, coming out of the soul. And you're basically kind of in Samadhi in that level, right? When you're at play, like, it's just like so in you.

**Speaker B:** You are Samatha because you You got it together. That's the word. That's what the word Samadhi means, is you got your stuff together.

**Speaker A:** And then the other understanding from that is the more technical Buddhist understanding, which is it sounds like a metaphor for guarding the mind. You know, practice and then the performance, you're guarding the mind. But then when the guarding the mind becomes so continuous, you don't even have to think about it. You're just— there's never going to be Anagami.

**Speaker B:** You've got a new set of habits. You've got a new set of habits. Exactly.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I like that. That image will stay. That's a good— that's a good image to keep.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, go practice some. Okay, go, go practice.

**Speaker A:** I will.

**Speaker B:** And start to play with it also, that in fact, this is what we do on Alone, is we begin to play with our own mind and our own body as if it were a toy. To experiment with it rather than setting a set of rules about it. So this is how we're going to practice now, is in a really playful way, because we're going to enjoy this stuff.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I'm looking forward to it. I mean, I'm going to start right here and I'm going to continue on, give my kid a bath, put him to bed, you know, all that stuff. I'll just keep it going.

**Speaker B:** All right, so when are you going to call again?

**Speaker A:** Let's see here. How often do people usually call you?

**Speaker B:** Okay, I'll answer that. You can call once or twice a week, something like that, for a while.

**Speaker A:** Okay. That works for me.

**Speaker B:** Up to you.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** I don't make appointments, but we need to keep at it.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I'll put it into practice for maybe the next 2-3 days, and then on day 3 or 4, I'll give you a call.

**Speaker B:** Excellent.

**Speaker A:** And I'll report how it's been applied. You know, the interesting thing about me is I'm very stubborn, and after I left Swamukha, I wrote down like the teacher ego is my biggest enemy because I'm always trying to be the teacher. And all the years that I've been practicing the Dharma, I've only done that retreat. And then now speaking to you is the only two times in my life I've ever actually sought advice from someone outside of my own practice. And it's very difficult.

**Speaker B:** All you're going to get from me is, hey man, you got to go do this for yourself. But I'm telling you what you got to do. Pick at you for some of the stuff that you have been doing rather than the Dhamma.

**Speaker A:** I'm impressed. I'm impressed at my mind's response to you because I'm usually so stubborn. The whole time somebody's trying to talk to me, I'm just like, no, you know, kind of like that, just evaluating. And then, but as you've been talking, it's just been a lot clicking and clicking and clicking and clicking and clicking. So I'm like, okay, good, I found somebody who can get through to me. Which I thought was impossible.

**Speaker B:** I've got my ways.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, he snuck in there though. Well, thank you, I appreciate that.

**Speaker B:** Okay, Michael, we'll see you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, have a good day. Yeah.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) in dialogue with a student, Michael (Speaker A), is a practical and direct guide to core Buddhist practice, emphasizing immediate application over abstract theory. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: Ending Dukkha Here and Now**
The central teaching is that the Buddha’s core message is **Dukkha and the cessation of Dukkha**. The goal is not to attain special states (Jhanas, Nibbana) in the future, but to achieve a state of **satisfaction and freedom from dissatisfaction in the present moment**.

### **Main Teachings and Corrections**

1.  **The Trap of Spiritual Materialism:** A major focus is warning against the common pitfall of craving spiritual attainments (e.g., Jhana, Nibbana, stream-entry). This craving itself is a form of **dukkha** and a hindrance. The idea that “I will be satisfied when I get X attainment” is identified as a mental concoction and a form of ignorance.

2.  **Change is the Path:** The essence of the path is **change**—specifically, changing the mind’s habits. This is linked to *anicca* (impermanence) and the Second Noble Truth: we create our own dukkha through greed, ill-will, and ignorance, and we have the power to change that.

3.  **From Unwholesome to Wholesome Thoughts:** The practical method is to **wake up (Sati)** and notice the mind’s activity. Then, use **right effort** to deliberately shift from unwholesome thoughts (planning, wanting, fixing, complaining) to wholesome ones. A wholesome thought is one that acknowledges “**everything is okay right now**.”

4.  **Redefining Key Concepts:**
    *   **Jhana:** Redefined not as a trance, but as the natural state that arises from sustaining **“one wholesome thought after another.”** It involves factors like feeling safe, secure, comfortable, satisfied, and successful.
    *   **Samadhi:** Clarified as **“having your stuff together,”** not merely concentration. It’s the collected, unified mind that results from wholesome thinking.
    *   **Right Intention (Samma Sankappa):** Framed as **“right attitude”**—the growing confidence that “I can handle this; I can clean up my mind.”

5.  **The Practice Framework: The 3 Ps**
    *   **Practice:** Dedicated, private time (like sitting meditation) to develop the skill of gladdening the mind and shifting thoughts.
    *   **Performance:** Applying the Dhamma “in public” or in daily life situations, consciously maintaining the wholesome attitude.
    *   **Play:** When the skill becomes effortless and “in the bones.” The mind plays with awareness joyfully and naturally, like a master musician improvising.

6.  **Anapanasati as a Framework:** The four-step process of calming the body and mind in Anapanasati is linked to creating a feeling of being **safe, secure, and comfortable**. This physical relaxation supports the mental shift to satisfaction.

7.  **Building New Habits:** The path is about piling up “wholesome sankharas” (mental formations) through repeated success in finding satisfaction. This builds the confidence (*saddhā*) and “mojo” needed to overcome doubts like “Am I up to this task?”

### **The Dialogue Dynamic**
The talk is a live demonstration of this teaching. Michael identifies his own “ham sandwich” problem—creating his own dissatisfaction by craving a past peaceful state or a future ideal. Dhammarato repeatedly brings him back from technical, future-oriented questions to the **immediate directive: “Take a deep breath and tell yourself right now everything is perfect.”**

### **Key Takeaways**
*   **Stop wanting enlightenment.** The desire for attainment is the primary obstacle.
*   **Your practice is to learn to be satisfied** by practicing satisfaction, not by practicing dissatisfaction.
*   **Change your mind now.** Wake up, see the unwholesome thought, and deliberately replace it with a wholesome one: “I am okay now.”
*   **The entire path is “rinse and repeat.”** This simple, persistent re-training of the mind’s habits leads to confidence, joy (piti), and ultimately, freedom from dukkha.

The talk de-mystifies Buddhist practice, presenting it as a straightforward, psychological skill of thought management aimed at achieving present-moment well-being.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this talk, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate key Dhamma points. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **Metaphors**
1. **“Cat out of the bag”**  
   - Used to describe Bhikkhu Buddhadasa’s role in revealing the “real Dharma” to the public—making something hidden widely known.

2. **“Rabbit hole”**  
   - Refers to over-analyzing *dukkha* (suffering) instead of seeing it clearly to let it go.

3. **“Climbing a ladder” / “Missing rungs”**  
   - Represents the gradual path of practice. The student is seen as trying to “jump to the roof” (enlightenment) while missing essential steps (foundational insights).

4. **“Pile of dirt” / “Emperor of your own pile of dirt”**  
   - The mind’s accumulated mental formations (*sankhara*). We can either be buried under it or sit on top of it (in control).

5. **“Hamburgers on a sewer”**  
   - Instead of trying to empty negative mental habits, pile wholesome thoughts on top until they dominate.

6. **“Ham sandwich story”**  
   - A man complains daily about his ham sandwich, only to realize he makes it himself. Illustrates how we create our own *dukkha* and blame others.

7. **“Rinse and repeat” (shampoo bottle instructions)**  
   - The need for continuous, repetitive practice in Dhamma.

8. **“Standing at the foot of a ladder wishing you were on the roof”**  
   - Craving for spiritual attainments instead of taking one step at a time.

9. **“Dark tunnel / light at the end”**  
   - Critiques the misconception that meditation is about entering a dull state to reach some future awakening.

---

### **Stories & Analogies**
1. **The Zen monk and the master**  
   - A young monk asks if the master is meditating to become enlightened. The master replies: “I’m not meditating because I don’t need to be enlightened.”  
   - **Point:** Satisfaction is already here; no need to seek something else.

2. **The piano student → performer → jazz musician**  
   - **Practice:** Learning the basics alone.  
   - **Performance:** Applying the Dhamma in public with careful attention.  
   - **Play:** Mastery so deep it becomes effortless and joyful, like a jazz musician improvising.  
   - **Point:** Stages of integrating Dhamma into life.

3. **Piano bar musician**  
   - A pianist plays complex music flawlessly while carrying on a conversation and being interrogated by detectives.  
   - **Point:** When Dhamma is “in the bones,” it remains steady under any conditions.

4. **Emperors seeking eternal life**  
   - Historical rulers who poisoned themselves with “immortality” elixirs.  
   - **Point:** Ignorant craving (even for spiritual goals) leads to harm.

5. **Child asked, “What will you be when you grow up?”**  
   - Contrasts with the Dhamma emphasis on “What are you right now?”  
   - **Point:** Cultural conditioning pulls us into future-oriented craving instead of present-moment satisfaction.

---

### **Recurring Themes in the Imagery**
- **Satisfaction vs. wanting:** Many metaphors highlight the trap of craving (for Nibbana, jhāna, etc.) versus being content here and now.
- **Self-responsibility:** The ham sandwich, pile of dirt, and ladder metaphors all stress that we create our suffering and must change our own minds.
- **Gradual training:** The ladder, music student, and rinse-and-repeat motifs emphasize continuous, patient practice.
- **Playfulness and joy:** The piano jazz musician and “playing with the mind” encourage a light, experimental attitude toward practice.

These metaphors and stories help make abstract Dhamma concepts relatable and memorable, while gently challenging the listener’s spiritual materialism and future-oriented striving.
