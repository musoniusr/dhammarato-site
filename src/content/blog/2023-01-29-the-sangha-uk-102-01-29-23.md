### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So I don't see an indication. Does anybody see an indication that the recording has started?

**Speaker B:** Yes, it started.

**Speaker A:** Okay, good. All right, so welcome to Sunday Sangha. In UK time, this is probably Sunday morning, and today Dean has asked a question about a sutta. Actually, the sutta is Sutta 111 in the Majjhima Nikaya, and the name of the sutta is One by One as They Occur. And we need to keep track of that one by one as they occur, because that's in fact much of the teaching discussion. What is it that we're going to be looking at one by one as they occur? Now, when the mind is in an ordinary state, that means that much of the things that occur one by one are unwholesome. But if we can somehow manage to get the mind into a state where it's wholesome, then whatever occurs one by one are going to be wholesome things, not unwholesome things. And this is an important quality, is that once we get far enough into the practice, then we abandon having unwholesome things to look at. So that we're going to start looking at the things that are wholesome. Now in this sutta, it talks about Sariputta taking a fortnight to go through this list of wholesome things one by one as they occur. But there's some background to this, and the background is that Sariputta was already on the spiritual path when he met the Buddha, that he just didn't come right out of the ordinary life, that he had already been practicing. So it's quite probable then that the 2-week period of time that we're talking about was not the basic foundation of meditation of getting his mind into being able to control and manage the first Jhana. He was already there. That's one of the ways that we can look at it, but the sutta is not actually clear about it. But based upon everyone's practice, getting into that first Jhana is probably 90% of the work. So you could say then that that fortnight was spent when he was doing the examination of the things that were wholesome. Because that's what the thing is, the sutta is about, that in fact it starts off after that paragraph when he says that it only took him a fortnight to do this. The first thing it says is, having been completely secluded from unwholesome thoughts and unwholesome states of mind, Sariputta entered and abided into the first Jhana. Which meant that he was probably doing that right from the get-go. That's before the 2 weeks started, or as the 2 weeks started. Okay, so now let's go through all of the things that are there that are wholesome, and that the first items on that list, one by one as they occur, are actually the Jhana factors of the first Jhana. So as we're going into the first Jhana, the thing to do is to take the factors of the first Jhana as our objects. And one of the objects that we're going to have is the object of being free from the hindrances, that we're applying the mind to be free from hindrances and then being able to sustain that. So applying the mind to the hindrances and sustaining it in a wholesome state is basically the first thing that's on that list, the wholesome stuff to do. In other words, how is my meditation? How is my Sati? How is my investigation? And we start looking at all of those factors of the Jhanas with that discernment, the discerning eye. We're investigating the states that we're in. Now when we go into the other Jhana factors of the first Jhana, like how good is my Piti That actually is now the introduction into the second Jhana, that when we no longer are paying attention to the words that we're saying and the wholesome things that we're saying to get us into a really, really good state, the second Jhana is actually paying attention to that really good state that we're in that doesn't really require us talking ourselves into it anymore, there we are. And so we change our object from the object of how nice it is into the object of voicelessly just experiencing how lovely, how nice, how blissful, if you want to use the word bliss, or how relaxed. Okay, so in fact, going through the Jhanas then are going through the various feeling processes that we have. And the second Jhana is the expression of how good can we feel. How good can you feel? What's your top note? What's your highest soprano note of absolute best feelings? Generally, it has the feeling to do with being a winner, being on top of your world, being a champion, being really, really good enough. The feeling of being an insider, of being at home, these are the very best feelings that we can have. And so we can talk ourselves into having those feelings, and then we just sit there experiencing those feelings of how nice this is. Okay, now Bhikkhu Buddhadasa points this out, but it's already quite easily seen in the suttas that that really, really peak experience of how really good can I feel it's not really a long-lasting thing. But that doesn't mean that we don't develop the skill of being able to create it. It's sort of like some kind of Chinese cooking: they use a very, very hot flame, but not for long. So we can see the Piti then is a very, very hot, exalted, superior feeling, very energetic. But then we cool it off down to the next level, which was actually the way that we got into that state of Piti was through Sukkha. So after we hit that peak, we come back into the state of Sukkha. An example with that of when they climb very high mountains like Everest, one of the important things that they do is they establish a base station. They haul up all of their gear to that base station, and then they sit in that base station and get acclimated And then they go to the top, to the summit. Guess what? They don't spend very much time at that summit; they come back to the base station. So think of that base station then as the Sukkha, and the Tepiti is kind of a very high event kind of thing, the top of your mountain. We're all mountain climbers, except that here we're not climbing the physical mountains which have got names; we're climbing the mountain of the mind, how high can your mind go? That's the Piti. But then we come back down to the base station, which would be then the third Jhana, and that third Jhana is the experience of Sukkha. But then we can let that feeling also subside And when it subsides, it goes down to what we would call Upekkha, or very, very restful. Now we can think of this also in the sense of brain waves, that we're actually learning to manipulate the brain waves, that when someone is very busy and very active, then they have as high as gamma rays, which is about a frequency of about 35 cycles a second. But the level of relaxation is down at the level of alpha, and that's what we're intending to operate with, is to being able to control our brainwaves so that we can— and by the way, for most people, there's no particular one frequency of a brainwave, that they're just all over the place, that they have a short frequency and then a long frequency and then a short frequency, very noisy within the mind. And what we're actually practicing is getting the mind in a stable state so that they can be at a particular frequency. And the frequency that we're looking for is the alpha wave, which is about 8 to 12, maybe around 10 cycles per second, which is actually what most meditation mystics and all throughout literature talk about, that that's the mind moment, which is about a tenth of a second. And that we can begin to manipulate how we feel in the sense of are we relaxed or are we uptight, are we excited. That in fact the frequency of the brain then determines how excited we are and that we're going to start to slow that down. And when we get it slow, we experience, wow, I could do this. And that's the Piti, that's what we call the Samma Sanghappa or the success story that we begin to tell ourselves. I can do this, oh how marvelous this is. And then by talking to ourselves like this in the first Jhana, that's what sets us up so that we can experience the second Jhana, which means we don't even have to tell ourselves how good we feel, we're too busy just feeling good. But then the baseline is to come back to the first Jhana, that we don't want to go back into the ordinary world because the ordinary world is painful. We want to be able to establish a base of operation that most of the work that we're going to put in is to be able to get the mind into the first Jhana and then apply it and sustain it and apply it and sustain it. And anytime that we're not in that state, we want to hop right back into it. But in fact, that state of being, that anytime that we're not in it and we want to hop right back into it, that's what's referred to as access concentration, to where we can go right back into it. We can go gather those factors. They got scattered, but here they are. Let's go put them back together again and get the mind in a really good state. Okay, so after we get to the Upekkha of the fourth jhana, now the mind is so stable, so solid, so relaxed that it can begin to see the way that the mind itself processes data so that we can come up with the images that the mind makes. This is the Piti— that's why the four jhanas and Piti are so deeply interrelated. Is that we have to get the mind settled down so that we can actually see, rather than just experience, or let us say accept the Paticcasamuppada as an intellectual teaching. We begin to experience it. We begin to actually see that we can in fact manipulate our perception. We can in fact begin to manipulate our Saleyatana, and the Saleyatana is our memory system. How are we going to manipulate our memory systems? It's by intentionally adding good, happy, wholesome memories, one after another, rather than just letting things occur and build up haphazardly. So we're actually going to intentionally give ourselves happy memories, good solid memories, and so then when we go to understand things, to— from our past, that's the past that we'll remember things from, so that we can actually then begin to automatically feel good because we've got it stored in our memory base, rather than going back to the old default of how it was when we were a child. So, Dean, this is where you were talking. Okay, we've got to get our mind fit for work so that we can then just start looking at very wholesome things. And eventually, when the mind gets stable, we get it down to where we can listen, we can see the mind when we're very, very quiet, very stable, and the waveforms actually go kind of below the alpha level down into maybe the theta level. Not sure about all the words, but we begin to slow the mind's cycles down. And that way we can begin to see those processes as they're occurring.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker C:** Before we go further again, your friend Tan Dhammavido, is that his name?

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato, yes. Uh-huh.

**Speaker C:** He speaks about— he has a good lecture series on YouTube, and he speaks about and I can get this far, like I can experience the Piti at times, but he talks like it's like for most people, it's like when we go up to a front door but we don't go in through the front door, but the Piti is just coming out of the front door, bits and pieces, and shooting little bits out of us. How do we get through that fucking front door? That's— I can experience the Piti, I have loads of times, but how do I walk through that front door? Okay, the real deal, you know what I mean?

**Speaker A:** Here is the secret to that, and that is, is that we got ourselves as far as we did get by working on being satisfied, coming back to the Sukkha, that everything is okay, and we begin to feel that way. And now you're talking about getting something, like getting through some door. Which means that now you've got thoughts about there's got to be someplace to go and something to do, that you want to get something, which means now you're no longer satisfied. So when you get to that state, you're not progressing in your first Jhana. You have actually moved back into ordinary thinking. The way to work with this then is to say, oh, never mind, this is good enough. Let me just sit here and experience things the way that they really are. This is the part where we really do have to get a very firm handle on that first Jhana, because if we want the second Jhana, the wanting of the second Jhana is in fact an unwholesome thought, and we have just destroyed our first Jhana. That we have to get completely into the first Jhana and get completely satisfied with it. That we have to practice it to where we can bring it on quickly, and then we have to practice it so that we can maintain it. And once we can maintain it, which means we can stay in that position of not wanting anything, not wanting the second Jhana, not wanting this, that, or the other thing, not wanting to go through some magical door that I've created in my mind, but rather, can I just be satisfied? Knowing that all of this pity is coming out from something. And so let's look at the experience of the pity. How good does this feel? Wow, this feels so great. This is good enough. This is the way that we practice it. Rather than saying, where does this all lead? It doesn't lead anywhere. It has to be developed right where it is. So we accept it the way that it is. This is how I feel right now. Isn't that marvelous? And so we continue to practice it that way, that this is good enough. And pretty soon it begins to build.

**Speaker C:** But if you get— so I leave somebody else to ask a question now, but one thing I want to say first is I'm on your team with about a year, roughly a year, and I tell you, on a subtle level, you have changed my life. Thanks very much. I'll leave it at that.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Okay. And what is that? That we learn to become satisfied. That things wind up being good enough. That when the students first start talking to me, they want this, they want that, they're unsatisfied. And then they begin to understand that all the first Jhana is actually the quality of being satisfied. That when we get satisfied enough, then we don't have to talk ourselves into being satisfied anymore. We can just experience it. And that's the progress that we make. But when we start wanting something new, that's what prevents us from getting something new, because we're actually— by wanting something new, we're just practicing the same old stuff we've been doing our whole lives, which is wanting something new. And when we stop wanting something new and really satisfied with what we've got right now, that's when we actually are making good progress. Everything is backwards in that regard, that when we want something, we're not progressing. If we want to progress, we're not progressing. When we become satisfied with where we are, that's progress. Reminds me of a story, by the way. The story has to do with an old book that was written many centuries ago. The name of the book is called Pilgrim's Progress. Do you know what a pilgrim is? It's somebody who goes from holy site to holy site. He's a pilgrim, he's on a journey. Well, what happens to the pilgrim when he gets to the holy site? Does he stay at the holy site, or does he just plan on his next trip to the next holy site? The question is, can you get yourself into that holy state and then stop planning for the next stop? Because you've already stopped. Here you are, stay in your holy place. That's the whole point of getting into a holy place, is so that you can maintain it, you can stay there. And so that holy state that we're looking for is actually the sustaining of the first Jhana, when the mind is whole, it's not disintegrated. But when we want the next step, now we brought in a disintegration. We've disintegrated the mind into wanting something that we don't have. What we really need to practice is being satisfied with how marvelous things are already. Right now. Does anybody have any comments about this? Yes. And do you have any comments? So let's just sit and be happy. Just sit and be satisfied. That's all there is to it, is just to sit and be satisfied.

**Speaker C:** Since nobody else is talking, What I will say is, when I was the best time I was at getting up to Piti was when I was nurturing each single breath at each time. That's when I had the best success at getting up to Piti.

**Speaker A:** Well, what you're saying is, is that with each of those breaths, each one of them, you were really there with it. Being in this present moment is what brings on that sense of joy. Of being alive.

**Speaker C:** And then I had people throwing shit at me, so I kind of went back to it again. But anyway, I get back there.

**Speaker A:** Well, the people were throwing what people throw. You didn't like it and called it shit, and that was what drove you out of the first Jhana. They didn't do it, you did it.

**Speaker C:** And also, now I know why you shouldn't get give yourself labels. I made myself a fucking huge target as well by telling people how happy and confident I was since I started fucking following the teachings of the Buddha, and I made myself a total target.

**Speaker A:** Well, now that you've set that up, um, you can, you can remember to do that every time that they make you into a target. You can say, yeah, you're— you got me. You could be happy too.

**Speaker C:** But the biggest thing for me, Dhammarato, is definitely the attitude change. For the first time ever, I've had a kind of a winner's happy attitude, and I was never like that. I have a tough— I'm working a job there now at the moment in a meat factory, and it would be considered a tough mundane job, but I'm just able to accept it and fucking— because it's physical, I'm able to do a lot of practice, this practice with it, and it just makes the job so much easier, so much easier.

**Speaker A:** I love to hear success stories.

**Speaker C:** Anyway, someone else must be there, they must be doing something in the background. So, Vedana, you come in and ask Dhammarato a question, will you?

**Speaker D:** I do have a question.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker D:** If one is in this happy state, being with this you just talked about, could that be in just every situation? In a destructive situation or whatever, how How does it relate to where I am in the world, so to speak?

**Speaker A:** All right, the first thing is that we have to recognize a disgusting situation. And eventually you'll recognize them in advance so that you don't get yourself into disgusting situations. Okay, so that's part of the skill, is to recognize that there are many times when we would be better off if we were not in this situation. And so we can walk away, right? Or we cannot even walk into it because you can see that there's a sticky situation, let us say, in that room. Don't go in that room. If you hear somebody arguing in that room, don't go in that room. That's the kind of way that— that's the way of wisdom. And that's the ultimate way, okay? But let's say that we weren't already in that position and now we find ourselves in that situation. There we are, we're in the room with it. The question then is, well, who is it that's in the room? Because you can be just an observer in that room without having to pick up all the stuff that's being thrown around. This would be the next level, is just to be the observer. But almost always, when, when let us say flak or whatever is thrown around, we want to be there to pick it up.

**Speaker D:** I stopped doing that most of the time.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the whole trick, is you just don't pick up the stuff that they're throwing around. It is not our business. We can avoid it. We don't have to get into it. There's some situations where— let me talk about it like this. Just, there's been another recent killing in Memphis. And that you could see that the police were doing their police thing the way that police do it, that the boy who got killed was resisting the police. He didn't like it. He was trying to pick it up and argue with them and tell them that what they were doing was not right. Well, of course it was not right what they were doing. Telling them so, when they're in that state, is not a wise idea. Running away from them, getting afraid, is what he did. He got really, really intensely afraid of the police, and because of that, they killed him, because he was trying to escape from them. So we all do that in little situations, in the sense of that people will do what they want to do, And we try to escape from it and argue with them and try to set them straight, etc., like that, which just makes everything a whole lot worse. And so the easy way that this young man could have handled it was completely going limp, telling the officers, "I surrender completely," and just go completely limp. If he had gone completely limp on them, then maybe some compassion would have shown. Oh, what's wrong with this guy? Oh, he's completely out of it now. But as long as he's resisting them, they're going to keep, let us say, trying to exert their power over him. So that happens in a normal, ordinary place. That's what bullies are all about. It happens at school. It happens in the workplace. It happens out on the street. It happens everywhere. And we as Dharma dudes have to learn that we don't have to resist. We don't have to come up with, oh, that's me you're hurting. But whether we can go— in fact, we can go limp, or a way that I described it is to take a hike, to get out of it. And if you can't get out of it, just be quiet, just sit, don't do anything. That in fact, when the bullies are not getting anything out of you, they'll go find somebody else to harass. And so, becoming very silent, just sitting, don't do anything at all, or if you're really, really together, you can just smile at them, with statements like, "Oh, that's very interesting." But what we do is we make ourselves targets. That I can reiterate this, we've just talked about it. There's a sutta number 63 in the Majjhima Nikaya that has the story of this guy who gets shot with an arrow. And that in this sutta, the guy not only gets shot with the arrow, but he waits. Until the doctor comes, and then he argues with the doctor. Now, this is what we ordinarily do, that when we're out there in the field and somebody shoots an arrow towards us, an arrow of an unhappy remark or whatever like this that you and Dean both have been talking about, we actually make ourselves a target. We stand up and let that arrow hit us. But an advanced student of the Dharma is going to stand out of the way of those arrows. He's not going to get hit. And a slightly less advanced student is going to get hit because he couldn't completely get out of the way, but he's going to remove that arrow immediately, just to take it out: "Oh, that's not me." But the best thing to do is to just let it go right by you. Like this, you know, the arrow is coming this way and it just goes like— I saw that and it missed me. Okay, so that means that we don't have to stand up to get hit by that arrow, which means that we don't have to feel afraid of the person who is shooting at us, whatever it is that they're shooting at us. They don't know me. They can't hit me as a target. Only I can hit me as a target. I have to actually make myself a target. That's what the self is, is that it's a target that's in danger. And so all you have to do in the situation is that if you become the target of somebody else's Metta say complaints, you can just sit there. Sit there and perhaps smile because it's not you. Whatever is coming at you is something that came out of their mind, not yours. There's no reason for you to pick that stuff up and stick it into your mind like you would stick yourself with an arrow. And so the kind of language for the first Jhana would be, 'Oh, that's not me.' Or, 'Look, they missed me.' Or in another context, we could say, 'Oh, that's not my business.' I mean, you've seen things on television and YouTube and whatever about politics, and instead of saying, 'Oh, ain't it awful that this party or that party or this politician or that politician does this, that, and the other thing,' The better way to say it is, that's not my business. Let them do what they want to do. I'm just here enjoying the show. And so we don't get involved with it, that we can in fact stop caring about what people say. Because what people say about you is not you.

**Speaker D:** Now I see that. That way of saying it, that's really good to hear in this context. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it's not you.

**Speaker D:** Yeah. I've been thinking about that word, you know, me and so on, the self and all of this, but this clarifies a lot what that is about. So yeah.

**Speaker A:** That if we are undefined, then when people define us, they missed because they've given a definition to something that is a moving target. You're in fact— that's the whole point about in the sutras about what is personality view, is stop having a view that you've got a personality. That you don't have a personality. The personality that you have is a moving target, is changing all the time. It's not fixed, it's not set. And that leads then to the most important part of that teaching, is that means then that we can change. We are not doomed to repeat our past over and over again, that we can do something wisely now because we're looking at what's going on. So, does anybody else have anything like this? Kath, it's been a while. What you up to now? Have you had that conversation with your mom yet?

**Speaker E:** I've been kind of pecking at the seeds, you know, I haven't really jumped in the whole, I haven't really had like this deep conversation because I still really feel like Uh, it's much, it's much better to just kind of give her compliments. Like, I've been telling her food is really, like, way more than I have. Like, her food has been really nice. I usually don't say those kinds of things, but I know how much I have noticed how much it affects her, you know.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, knowing that, pour it on. Yeah, start appreciating many things that she does. Whenever she comes in the room, hi, I'm glad to see you. Okay, really start to treat her well. And the next part of that is, is that recognize that every time that you do that, in a way you're forgiving her for all of the stuff that you've been holding against her all of this time.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, it's, uh, it's quite literally feeling poisoned, you know. Inside yourself. So I see that clearly as like blatantly, completely confronted by it. It's just in me, and I, you know, why would I want to carry that? So I, I just keep piling it on. But I guess, uh, the thought of having some really deep conversations squirms me inside, you know. I think I will, uh I will, uh, before I leave here, I'm definitely going to, um, attempt it, you know, some kind of format. I know how good it will be anyways for myself.

**Speaker A:** So yes, it will be enormously valuable for her and you. And I really do like your build-up to that. Yeah, yeah, of telling her that you enjoy her food and start to tell her all of the little things you begin to enjoy that she's that way, and then you can actually open up and tell her that you have been holding a bunch of stuff against her and that you're letting that go because you want to be really close friends with her. I mean, this is something that all of us needed to do when we were young and we didn't do it, and that's square things around with our parents.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, because I know we're all going to be dead, so it's like, I think it's good. I mean, they are quite more quicker than me, so it's best to do it, you know. I was told that before, someone told me about, you know, like it's I mean, I know a lot of people, when their parents die, they have a lot of like regret and they have a lot of noise in their head because they never really expressed certain things.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, our society actually has it set up that way, that it's a common, common thing for teenage boys in the Western society to kind of have it out with their dad, a big blow-up, you know, that it just builds and builds and builds. And that quite often the things that the son and the father are arguing about is merely the kind of language that they're using to describe the same thing. They both agree with each other, they just want to fight. The son wants to establish his manhood, while the father wants to re-establish his fatherhood, which are naturally in conflict with one another. And so, the way that we have to learn to do that wisely is to come out of those roles of son, growing up, or father, etc., so that we can actually be friends with one another. And what you're doing with your mom now will fit right into that, to start making friends with her, because ultimately that's what you want to do with your dad also, is to have him to become a friend. And for some of us that sounds almost terrifying.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, yeah, definitely. It's a— I think with the father it's a different situation, you know? It's not the same as the mother, I don't think anyway. It is in a sense, but it's not, you know?

**Speaker A:** Well, it is the same, and the whole series is the same, What's different is your degree of bad feelings.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, exactly. Yeah, and it's the approach too, I think. It's slightly different with the woman.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Well, that's because mommies always are the ones who take care of the little kids in the beginning, and so our stronger relationship is almost always with with mommy. But that's how our societies operate. And so the daddies don't ever see tender infants as tender infants, they always see them as little kids that are just a little me. To where mothers will see their tender infants, even when they grow up, they still have the idea of this kid, this 19-year-old boy is still tender infant in my arms, right? And so there's that different perspective that the parents have because of our society. And so you can fit in with your mom then by appreciating her and all that she's doing for you and get close to her like that. And the way that you can do that with your dad is by beginning to agree with everything he says. You'd be surprised that you probably already do anyway.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I'm just kind of— because, yeah, I just agree with everything. I don't even, you know.

**Speaker A:** But now you're going to do it with gusto, wholeheartedly. You're right, Dad. Wow, I hadn't looked at it like that before. You're absolutely right. And so that's the way to begin, uh, your healing of your relationship with your parents. And I highly recommend that to everybody, is to start making friends with your parents. Start bringing back that sense of community within your own family that is quite often messed up in the society that we're in. That's one of the things that I appreciate about the Thai society is they still know family. Where in the West, family is been kind of eroded with individualism.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I kind of wish families were more like larger in the sense like the child was more a child of the community rather than just this little family, you know, like the whole community was the parents of the child rather than just we're gonna like blockade ourselves, we're gonna separate ourselves from the community as a family, you know. But instead of just having one large community, that's the family. Makes a lot more sense.

**Speaker A:** That in fact, a lot of the communities, small farming communities in Thailand, are a family. They've always been a family. Everybody in the community is at least a half cousin or something. And so that's actually part of the attitude, that if we can bring our family feelings back into our own family, that will then help us to go into the community and learn to make good close friends with other people also. That this is really the teaching of the Buddha when he says that friendship is 100% of the Dharma. It comes in two phases. One is we have to learn to make friends with ourselves on the inside, to start nurturing, to start giving ourselves warm fuzzies rather than cold pricklies, to stop having conceptual ideas of conflict and following the rules and concepts and criticism, to stop being critical of one another. In fact, that's what you learned, Kath, was from your family, was criticism. That's what your whole family is all about. But they were doing that criticism from the perspective of wanting you to be better. They actually were doing it out of a sense of love, but the criticism kind of took over and you missed the love part of it.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I see, I see that, uh, really clearly now, like, uh, over the years of reflecting on the childhood stuff, you know.

**Speaker A:** So, Yesin, you had your hand up for a moment there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I just wanted to add on the topic of, uh, that Tathagata wished that Families consisted of more people. I think this is a fairly recent invention by Western societies, that nuclear family where it's like the mom, the dad, and the two children, and maybe grandfather, grandmother. And these old sayings usually had some truth to them, like it takes a village to raise a child and things like that. And my country was industrialized at a later point in time, so 2 generations back, it used to be that, you know, people lived in small villages. You knew everyone, like there were 50 people in a few houses and everyone knew everyone. And like at least 3 generations lived under the same roof and things like that. So it was a much more tight-knit community than what the industrialized world offers. So maybe we have lost some of that because now when you only have like your mom and your dad, what happens if you get shitty ones? You know, you're stuck in that situation but if it was like a larger net, first there would be some accountability and there would be other, I guess, not parental figures, but what's the word, other caregivers that could have given better models for you to imprint while growing up. So unfortunately, Western society has screwed us on that point.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] Yes, but that doesn't mean that we have to stay screwed. That we now know that we've got a choice, that we can come out of that, and we can repair these relationships, and we can set things straight. But it's going to take some effort, some right noble effort to do that. And the place to generate that effort is by being able to clean out our own mind. But that's actually the harder part. Once we get our own mind straightened out, then learning to deal with others, even ordinary people, is kind of an easy thing to do. Why? Because you already know them very well, because we're all really alike. That I've got greed, they've got greed, I've got criticism, they've got criticism. And so when we recognize that we're all in this together Now, we can begin to treat each other better. Rather than blaming your dad for all the ill will that you had for him, you can recognize, "Oh, I don't have to have that ill will at all, that he's just an ordinary guy, and he can make friends with people, bet I can make friends with him too.".

**Speaker B:** Or, you know, you could just take the other advice, which was like, don't put yourself in bad situations, and you could just eject. Many people, you know, just like, if they don't like how they've been parented and stuff, just like separate from their family when they get the chance and go off and do their own thing. So I don't know which is wiser, but yeah.

**Speaker A:** Go ahead, Kath.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I was wondering, do you think you can empty your mind out without having to be physically doing it with the person? And it's like, if you, let's say, left the country forever, just for example, do you think you can empty the mind out to the point? Or yeah, do you think you can empty the mind out when you're not physically with the person?

**Speaker A:** Like Oh yes, absolutely. Out of sight, out of mind is very, very common within human beings. And in fact, for let us say elderly people whose parents have been dead for 30 years, they don't think about their parents very much. But young people think about their parents a lot. Why? Because let us say that they've been away from the parents for 3 or 5 years, but they spent 20 years with the parents, so the ratio is, you know, about 7 to 1 in the sense of having thoughts about them. But if they've been dead for 30 or 40 years, then the likelihood of you thinking about your parents is probably very low. It's probably contextual in the sense that some email comes up or some old family member mentioned something or whatever like that, it's always coming up in the present moment to where when we're young we keep digging up our parents.

**Speaker E:** Because what I've noticed is like they get projected even when you like— the image you still have of them in your mind that's just there is being projected even no matter where you go, you know, because it's still kind of you're still very much attached to them even though you've left. Obviously, like, you're far, far away. It's, it's being projected all over the place.

**Speaker A:** Like, and, uh, yes, and that, and that attachment is not always wholesome. We tend to continue to blame our parents for the situation that we're in, almost as if I've been out of the house for 5 years, but the reason I'm out of the house is because I didn't like my dad. And so we continue to blame each other, our parents. And as I started to mention a while ago, the Buddha was actually very big on making friends with our family to clean that up. He in fact at one occasion made the analogy that even if you carried your parents around on your shoulders and took them to the store and to wherever they wanted to go so that they didn't have to walk, and you did that for months and years, you still wouldn't be able to pay them for the fact that they gave you life.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, but if you can show them, if you can establish them in the Dhamma, it's like you've repaid them like tenfold of what you could ever do for them or something.

**Speaker A:** Right, and every time you smile and laugh and tell your dad that he's right, that's Dhamma. Okay, making him feel good, that's Dhamma. And we actually have to practice that because we're not very good at it. In fact, one of the things that I remember about my own let us say teenage times especially, is that I wouldn't compliment anybody for anything. No possible way would I give anybody a compliment. Now, the bottom of that was that I didn't ever learn the habit of complimenting people. But now, as you see, while I'm on the air here with the Dhamma, that that's what I want to do. I want to encourage students, I want to encourage people, I give them compliments so that they can see the bright side of life. And so that was a major change that I had to make, to stop resisting that quality of not ever giving anybody a compliment. But I also know where it came from. And that is, is that how dare me have to lift them up when they won't lift me up? That that was actually it, that it was actually a selfish position that I was in. And when we recognize, oh, we don't have to do that, that in fact everybody is lifted up, everybody feels better when we give them warm fuzzies, when we give them compliments, and that's especially true when we learn to compliment ourselves and tell ourselves, "You're doing okay. You're all right, kid." You begin to love yourself, warts and all. That doesn't mean that we don't see the problems. Oh, we do see them, and we're quite willing and happy to do something about it. But most of the time we're trained to hate our darker nature and therefore not see it. And because we don't see it, we blame other people for our own problems. But if we're able to look at our own darker nature and make friends with it, then we don't blame anybody else for our own problems. We could just— that's it. Okay, so I've got an old bad habit. Never mind, I can change. And so that's what I'm encouraging you to do, Kath, is you can change your attitude and then change your behavior about your parents. We can all do that. It's a good thing for each one of us to do. Even if they're dead, we can still change our attitude about them. Anna, do you have anything to add?

**Speaker D:** Well, thank you, because it's really helpful what you said.

**Speaker A:** Good. Yeah, good to see you. I'm glad that you're on. Thank you. So does anybody else— Agnes or Veda or Yasin, Kat— do you have anything else to add?

**Speaker E:** Oh yeah, I was wondering, um, when it comes to wholesome thoughts about your parents, um, uh, is it ever— is it good to like visualize things that, uh, or to create scenarios that never happened but you kind of wish to happen? Because I've seen this in a lot of psychology kind of forums where people talk about how when they're dealing with inner child stuff is that they start to visualize things that they wish happened, like they start to visualize the perfect parent scenario or something. And it can be very cathartic for people to do that. And I was wondering what do you think about that?

**Speaker A:** Yes, I would highly recommend, now that you're mentioning that, visualize you having a walk with your dad. Visualize the two of you sitting in the living room discussing something with great joy. Visualize giving your dad a hug. Visualize giving your dad a why. What do I mean? That's the Thai word, out of respect. So give yourself images of you respecting your dad. Have images of things that he is worthy of respect for. Start thinking about the good things about him. That he's a good driver, or he's a good postman, or he's good whatever it is. Allow yourself to see that he did a good job. He's good. He supported you all of these years. And so you can visualize those kinds of things. More than likely though, without you having the wisdom to do this, The visualizations are going to be there anyway, only now the visualizations of the things that you remember having. So instead of having new visualizations and new memories, you're reapplying on the old ones where you now visualize you pointing your finger at your dad, or you're visualizing him with his hands in the air, or some things like that that indicate that the image that you've created may have actually happened in the past, but it wasn't actually a noble situation, that it was full of Dukkha. So now start to have visualizations of your dad that are free from that. Start seeing yourself joyful towards him. That's what in fact Metta would be all about. Is when we say, may all beings be happy. In this case, may your dad be happy. So start visualizing him as happy. Start seeing him as walking in the park with you. You've got a very powerful mind there, Kat. Start to use it for hope's purposes. See your dad as a close friend, because this is exactly what we're talking about with the practice of Anapanasati, the practice of Metta. It's all the same. And that is let's come out of our negative feelings and come have positive feelings. We can. You are in control of your feelings, but we've let them go on automatic pilot. Now it's time to change, to start taking control over the way that we feel.

**Speaker D:** I think a big change for me when you're talking about this, that happened actually quite some time ago, but the thing I discovered, I started looking for the good qualities in people instead of the bad ones, because about the criticizing mind, I used to do that all the time. I never saw almost saw anything good in people unless it benefited me in some way. So then I started to change that, and with that I discovered that today often people do the same with me. That was also a big discovery for me. Is this happening? So all those good things started to happen to me thanks to that, I think. Yeah, I couldn't see myself before, how people used to say I was so negative and this and that. I couldn't see it even. I didn't know what they were talking about. I didn't know what am I doing wrong. So That was a huge change for me. And what you're talking about, the smiling and what am I supposed to do, how can I do? I didn't know anything, but just be silent. This silence can be a great gift, just to listen and just to be there and all of that. When I don't know what to do, I can just be silent and know this is a good thing. This is great to do. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Thank you, Agnes. That was a really good testimonial. Yes. And in fact, what you're pointing out is that we're all alike. We all do that. We all start off really negative. People will tell us that we're negative, but we don't hear it. But now that you've come out of your negativity, now you can recognize everybody's doing it. Everybody goes around being negative, and it's our job is to not be affected by their negativity, but rather to add something positive back into the mix, expecting them to be negative. Like, Kat, you can expect your dad to be negative for a while, but that's not going to stop you from being positive. And it'll eventually sink in.

**Speaker D:** And it's a great pleasure for me to be able to do that. Whatever their reaction is, I can be happy with that. And I can kind of be with that. They are the way they are because they are conditioned to be like that right now. So, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. Excellent. Well, Vedana, you have been very quiet today. Do you have anything to add? No.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** Well, thank you guys so much. This has been a really delightful conversation. We've had actually two parts of it. One was starting off with Jhana, and then we ended up in how to actually apply that Jhana when we're out in the world. So thank you all very much. I hope to see you again.

**Speaker E:** Thanks, Dhammarato. Thanks, everyone.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** We'll see you. Yeah, we'll see you all on Skype.

**Speaker D:** Thank you so much, see you soon.

**Speaker A:** Okay, all right guys, this has been great. Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Have a good one, bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key teachings and discussion points:

### **Core Teaching: The Jhanas and a Wholesome Mind**
The talk, centered on the sutta "One by One as They Occur" (MN 111), explores how to cultivate a mind that observes only wholesome states. The primary method is mastering the **first Jhana**, which is presented as the foundation—about 90% of the work.

*   **First Jhana (Satisfaction):** This is a state of seclusion from unwholesome thoughts, characterized by **applied and sustained attention** on wholesome objects. The crucial attitude here is **complete satisfaction**—being content with the present state without wanting more. Progress happens not by striving for the next stage, but by deepening contentment with "good enough."
*   **Second Jhana (Joy/Piti):** When satisfaction in the first Jhana becomes deep and stable, it naturally matures into a **joyful, energetic feeling** (*piti*). This is compared to reaching a mountain summit—a peak experience not meant for prolonged dwelling.
*   **Third & Fourth Jhana (Happiness & Equanimity):** One returns to a stable, peaceful base of **happiness** (*sukha*), akin to a base camp. As this settles further, it leads to **tranquil equanimity** (*upekkha*). This settled mind allows for clear insight into mental processes.

### **Practical Application in Daily Life**
The second major theme is applying this meditative stability to interpersonal relationships and difficult situations.

*   **Don't Make Yourself a Target:** When faced with criticism or conflict (metaphorical "arrows"), the Dhamma practice is to **not identify with the attack** ("that's not me"). By not picking up the negativity, you avoid creating suffering for yourself.
*   **Wisdom in Action:** The ideal is to avoid "disgusting situations" proactively. If caught in one, the skilled response is **non-resistance**—staying calm, silent, or even "going limp" to de-escalate, much like not resisting a bully.
*   **Healing Relationships (Especially Family):** A significant portion of the discussion focused on repairing familial bonds (e.g., with critical parents).
    *   The method is to actively **cultivate and express positivity**: give genuine compliments, express appreciation, and seek agreement.
    *   This is an active practice of *metta* (loving-kindness) that repairs old patterns of blame and criticism. It also serves as internal healing, forgiving others to release one's own "poison."
    *   One can use **wholesome visualization** to imagine positive interactions with family members, creating new, positive mental patterns to overwrite old, negative ones.

### **Key Takeaways for Practitioners**
1.  **Progress is Backwards:** Wanting the "next" spiritual stage (e.g., second Jhana) is an unwholesome desire that undermines the first Jhana. **True progress is found in deepening satisfaction with the present wholesome state.**
2.  **Jhana is a Practical Toolkit:** The purpose of developing Jhana is not just for seated meditation but to create a **stable, happy, and resilient mind** that can be applied to all of life's challenges.
3.  **The Inner Work Enables Outer Harmony:** Cleaning up one's own mind of negativity and criticism is the prerequisite for healing external relationships. By changing your internal dialogue, you change how you perceive and interact with others.
4.  **Community & Friendship:** The talk emphasized that Dhamma practice is fundamentally about **cultivating friendship**—first with oneself, then with others, starting with one's own family.

In essence, the talk wove together deep meditation instruction with very practical advice for living, emphasizing that a calm, satisfied mind, free from wanting and blaming, is the key to both spiritual insight and peaceful, harmonious relationships.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by the speaker (Dhammarato) to explain Buddhist meditation and life principles:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Mountain Climbing (for Jhana Stages):**
    *   **The Summit (Piti):** The peak, exhilarating experience of the second Jhana is compared to reaching the summit of a mountain like Everest. It's a high point, but you don't stay there long.
    *   **The Base Camp (Sukkha):** The third Jhana, a state of sustained happiness and contentment, is likened to the base camp. It's the stable, acclimated place you return to and operate from.

2.  **Cooking (for Intensity of Feeling):**
    *   The intense but short-lived feeling of **Piti** (joy/rapture) is compared to a very hot flame in Chinese cooking—powerful and used for a brief, specific effect, not sustained.

3.  **Brain Waves / Radio Frequencies (for Mind States):**
    *   An ordinary, busy, and noisy mind is compared to having chaotic, mixed brainwave frequencies (like gamma, beta).
    *   A calm, meditative mind (first Jhana and beyond) is compared to a stable, clear frequency like the **alpha wave** (around 10 cycles/second). The practice is about "tuning" the mind to this stable, relaxed frequency.

4.  **The Front Door (for Accessing Deeper States):**
    *   Used by another teacher (Tan Dhammavido/Dhammarato) and referenced by a student. The profound state of **Piti** is like a house. Most people only get little bits of it "coming out the front door," but the challenge is how to fully "walk through the front door" and enter the state completely.

5.  **The Arrow (for Taking Offense):**
    *   A harmful remark or situation is compared to an **arrow being shot at you**.
    *   The unskillful response is to **stand up and let it hit you** (taking it personally, making yourself a target).
    *   The skillful Dharma response has three levels:
        *   **Advanced:** See the arrow coming and **step out of the way** entirely (not letting it affect you).
        *   **Intermediate:** Get hit but **immediately pull the arrow out** ("that's not me").
        *   The metaphor teaches non-identification and not internalizing others' negativity.

6.  **The Moving Target (for the Self):**
    *   The concept of a fixed "self" or personality is compared to a **target**. If you are undefined (not having a fixed view of self), you become a **"moving target."** When people try to define or attack you, they "miss" because there's nothing solid for their criticism to stick to.

7.  **Warm Fuzzies vs. Cold Pricklies (for Internal/External Speech):**
    *   **Warm fuzzies** represent compliments, encouragement, and kind, wholesome thoughts.
    *   **Cold pricklies** represent criticism, harshness, and unwholesome thoughts.
    *   The practice involves learning to give yourself and others "warm fuzzies" instead of "cold pricklies."

### **Stories & Analogies**

1.  **Pilgrim's Progress:**
    *   Referencing the classic Christian allegory, the speaker compares a meditator to a **pilgrim**. The key insight is that once you find a "holy state" (like the first Jhana), the goal is not to immediately plan the journey to the next one, but to **learn to stay and abide in the holy place you've found**. Progress means sustaining satisfaction, not craving the next experience.

2.  **The Police Encounter / Going Limp:**
    *   Using a contemporary example of a police confrontation, the speaker advises that when faced with aggressive "power" (like a bully or an angry person), the unskillful response is to **resist and argue** (which escalates conflict).
    *   The skillful response, akin to Dharma practice, is to **"go limp"**—to not resist, not engage in the power struggle, and completely surrender the need to be right or defend a "self." This disarms the situation and allows for the possibility of compassion.

3.  **Repaying Parents' Debt:**
    *   Referencing a teaching from the Buddha, the speaker says that even if you carried your parents on your shoulders for their whole lives, you couldn't repay the debt of them giving you life.
    *   However, the ultimate way to repay them is to **"establish them in the Dhamma"**—which, in practical terms, begins by making them happy through your kindness, respect, and positive relationship.

4.  **The Testimonial of Changing Perception:**
    *   While not a traditional story, **Speaker D (Agnes)** shares a personal narrative about how she used to only see the bad qualities in people. When she consciously started looking for the **good qualities**, her entire experience of the world changed, and people began to reflect that positivity back to her. This serves as a modern, experiential story of how changing internal habits alters external reality.

### **Core Conceptual Metaphors**
*   **The First Jhana is a "base of operation" or "home"** – a wholesome state you constantly return to.
*   **Access concentration** is like being able to quickly "gather scattered factors" and reassemble the calm state.
*   **Memory is a storage system** – we can intentionally stock it with wholesome, happy memories instead of haphazard, painful ones.
*   **Meditation is climbing the mountain of the mind** – seeing how high (calm, joyful, peaceful) it can go.

These metaphors and stories effectively translate abstract meditation concepts (Jhana, Piti, Sukkha, non-self) and ethical principles (non-contention, gratitude, right speech) into relatable, everyday imagery and narratives.
