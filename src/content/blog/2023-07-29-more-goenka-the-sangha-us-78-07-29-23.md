### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, so this is the Friday evening call for the US, also Saturday morning here, 9 AM in Thailand. And Daniel was just mentioning that he had gone to a retreat At Goenka, was that the only retreat, Goenka retreat that you've done?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, my first one. I was really curious to just see what it was like just spending like hours meditating. I don't know. I don't know what I was expecting. Honestly, nothing happened.

**Speaker A:** Here's an interesting point, is that the schedule that they have comes out of Burma. For people who are fairly advanced, but the teaching is for beginners. And almost all of the students that do Goenka retreats are doing it the first time. I've got a friend, his name is Thad. Last time I talked to him, he was the logistics manager, like the number 2 guy at the Goenka retreat center in California. And so he knows all about the computers and all of that kind of stuff, the applications that they file and computerize. Got some statistics and that kind of stuff. And what he pointed out was, is that when a person does another retreat, a second retreat, it's often as many as 7 years. Between the two retreats.

**Speaker B:** Oh, interesting.

**Speaker A:** And that we kind of contribute that to the fact that the schedule is ferocious.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like a trial by fire, I think. I think that's the intention, is to just make it so brutal that it leaves a mark. Like, Goenka even jokes about how all the students must be suffering. He like would always crack jokes about it on the recording.

**Speaker A:** Oh well, the recording would crack jokes.

**Speaker B:** About the strong determination, like how painful it is, stuff like that, and waking up early.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I don't understand why that, uh, because that's not actually the teaching of the Buddha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's another thing. He's very sneaky about that. He's just like kind of passes off his whole system as a teaching of the Buddha, but, uh And pretty much everybody there doesn't know anything about Dhamma or Buddhist teaching or anything. They're just total beginners, so they just kind of take what he's saying as like fact, as like reliable, but really it's kind of his own thing, and it's very like overlooked by everybody or just gone unnoticed.

**Speaker A:** I would say offhand that he didn't get all of the training that he could have gotten if he had stayed in Burma. The situation was, is that in the 1950s, when the Burmese government, let us say, became free from the British government, the British government had been in India for centuries, and they brought their entire administration out of India into Burma rather than having to retrain the Burmese for their bureaucracy. So when the Burmese took over, their intention was to change the bureaucracy from Indian back to Burmese. In doing that, Goenka was deported. And I think that that was 1959 when he was deported, and he had only been a student for several years of, uh, U Ba Khin. Yeah. And by the way, U Ba Khin was one of these Burmese government officials. Yeah, very high ranking.

**Speaker B:** Um, he apparently had a ton of responsibility in the government that he had to manage, like all the accounting and all this managerial stuff. He was like super, uh, involved, which is impressive.

**Speaker A:** Like the, the, uh, the secretary of, uh Treasury. That would be the U.S. equivalent. So he was in charge of the— so he was in charge of all of these new accountants that had been Buddhist all of this time. And so that schedule was set up, so I understand, for adult Burmese who had been practicing, but they were giving them time off of work. That's where the 10-day course came from, was from Friday evening to the following Monday morning. Yeah, and so, um, in that situation also, uh, Goenka was Indian and he did not get all of the Hinduism out of his teachings. There's— oh yeah, shards and shreds of that kind of stuff. And, um, one of the— what specifically.

**Speaker B:** Like the Samskara stuff?

**Speaker A:** Well, I'm about to get into it. Okay. One of the points was that a lot of the Indian women who were doing the retreats, especially because he would do both English and Hindi retreats. Okay. He also went around India that I would follow him to Jaipur. I would follow him to Hyderabad. And I think that there was a couple of others and that in, in that the Indian part the Indians would do the kind of pujas that they do in the temple. They would bring their bells, they would bring their beads, they would bring their own incense. They were bringing stuff in there, and that this is where Goenka got the idea that you have to practice what we're teaching here. And so that's why that's pretty strong as a point. Was that a lot of the teachings that he did, he did actually do to the Hindus. And this is in the early days when he had just gotten back, because I was there in 1980, '81, that time period, '82. So one thing is like the dress that he would— in fact, I'm wearing the same thing. I can't complain because I'm wearing a plaited sarong. The way that he would wear. And I don't have any real remembrance of things that were absolutely outrageously Hindu, but that the thing that I found most interesting, in fact, the reason that I finally left Igatpuri was because I knew deep inside, after all of that time with him, because he had just started the Satipatthana retreats as well, that there was something missing in the teaching.

**Speaker B:** That's the Satipatthana, is like the noting stuff.

**Speaker A:** Well, actually, the only thing that would be different would be, it was just like a new retreat or a second retreat, the second grade kind of thing. And the schedule was exactly the same. The sitting was exactly the same. And more or less, the teachings were about the same thing. But that the Burmese system has always been fairly oriented around the Satipatthana Sutta as opposed to the Anapanasati Sutta. You see, the Anapanasati Sutta is according to Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, this is a point that he made, was that the Buddha only taught one type of meditation practice or one thing, and that was Anapanasati. That the Satipatthana Sutta is a kind of a companion, but it doesn't really have any actual instructions. And it is based upon the Four Foundations, you know, the Satipatthana, just as the Anapanasati Sutta is. And that in the Anapanasati Sutta, it says that we're practicing Anapanasati for the fulfillment of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. And then we practice the Four Foundations of Mindfulness for the fulfillment of the Sambujhana, the Seven Factors of Enlightenment. And then we practice the Seven Factors of Enlightenment for knowledge, vision, and then release or escape. Let's see which word is used— deliverance. And so, this sequence is kind of hard to tell. It's almost like the Satipatthana Sutta was delivered in a different time, maybe a year or two or something different than the Anapanasati Sutta. Anicca. But that the— here's an interesting point, and that is the early part of the Satipatthana Sutta goes into a kind of history that talks about the practices that were happening early in the Buddha's time, including the charnel ground meditations. And this is also covered in Sutta number 119 which is the Kaya Nupassana Sutta, which is about the body. But they do break off, because there's in fact no Vedana or Citta or Dhamma Nupassana Sutras, there's only a Kaya Nupassana Sutra, which gives the idea that maybe there was some stuff that was missing. Maybe it never got around.

**Speaker B:** And so you're saying that's where all the Vipassana stuff is like derived from? That's where they got it from, right?

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay. Yes, and that the, um, uh, the better parts of the Satipatthana Sutta is in the Dhamma Nupassana, simply because everything is so different from the Anapanasati Sutta to the Satipatthana Sutta. In other words, the Dhamma Nupassana part of the Anapanasati Sutta talks about the process of the mind in the sense of Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta, or Anicca, the constant changing leads to deterioration and finally the destruction, and then the letting go and the release. But in the Satipatthana Sutta, that Dhammanupassana starts off first with hindrances, because that's what people are going to experience in the first until they get rid of the hindrances, they're going to do that. And then the next part of the Dhammanupassana in the Satipatthana Sutta is Dhamma, that's to be investigated. In other words, if you look at it in this way, you have first unwholesome, and then you begin to have wholesome thoughts, and the wholesome thoughts are intentionally Dhamma. Now in the Anapanasati Sutta, the Eightfold Noble Path and the Four Noble Truths is discussed extensively, and the Seven Factors of Enlightenment are only mentioned, to where in the Anapanasati Sutta it looks like that the Seven Factors of Enlightenment, the Sambhojana, is central. Now here's one point. For one thing, this is that Goenka hardly ever referred to the Eightfold Noble Path, which is actually the real teaching of Buddha, and that he doesn't mention the Sambhogana that I remember ever. And that what I began to put together, because the Satipatthana Sutta talks about the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path, but the Anapanasati Sutta talks about the Sambhogana, I began to recognize, oh, they're the same thing. One of them is a to-do list and the other one is a done-that list. Mm-hmm. Okay. The Seven Factors of Enlightenment are after we've well practiced the factors on the Eightfold Noble Path. They become enlightenment factors as the skills are developed.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So the first item on the Sambojana is unremitting mindfulness. Now, that word unremitting we can think of as persistent, okay, or insistent. You keep coming back and coming back and coming back. Well, if you— the way that a lot of people have it is that you've got to go there and stay there, and the mind doesn't work like that. That is, that it's not a kind of an indwelling, it's more of a repetitive coming back to it. An example of that would be if you hold the pedal down on a piano or hold a note down, you just strike that note and hold it, it will have an intensity in the beginning and then the fading off. And if you keep holding that key, you're going to not have any music anymore, it's going to stop. Yeah, but if you come back and hit it again, then it's going to make another sound again. Or like beating a drum. So the example that I would use is this would be the drum head and this would be the mallet. Is this the way to make music? No, you're not going to have any music on a drum like that. What you have to do is hit it. Okay, and so this is what that quality of unremitting is, is that we keep having to do it. We keep having to apply it over and over and over again. This is what makes it an enlightenment factor, is that we keep coming back, we keep remembering. Now, that's another word that we can put in there, is the word Sati is actually, or let us say, most frequently in the English translated as mindfulness. And yet mindfulness is not a word that we would commonly use in English. In fact, the reason that mindfulness has become common in the English is because because of its application to Buddhism. All of those years, nobody ever used the word mindfulness. They would do— they would make a statement like, mind your P's and Q's, because of the letters, you know, they're switched back and forth. The kids will get K's and R's backwards and things like that. So yeah, if we realize that the word mindfulness actually is kind of misleading, that the minding of the Ps and Qs can't be done unless you remember to keep track. This is part of the reason why on computers now, people's spelling is a whole lot better, is because it will be underlined to remind the people that this is a misspelled word or that the computer doesn't have this word in it. So, this is what we mean by reminding. This is the quality of the Sati, and so the unremitting Sati would be that it's coming back and coming back. We remember to remember. Remember to come out of the past or whatever the mind is doing into the present moment. This is the remembrance. And that the word mindfulness is possibly closer to the word investigation. Which is what the second one on the list of the Sambojhana is, unremitting investigation of the mind states. And it's interesting about that word state because that's also what we're looking at in the Anapanasati Sutta in the sense of gladdening the mind means that we're not actually just having gladdening words, but we're actually changing our attitude. We're actually changing the mind state. The state of the mind needs to be changed. And so this is often one of the things that students fail to look for, in the sense of, what's my state of mind right now? Am I worried? Am I trying to solve some problem? Or am I in a state of everything is okay and there's no problems to solve? So if we practice this way, which is part of the reason that the Goenka system is so hard for people, is because they get themselves in a frustrated state of mind. And Goenka is joking about leaving them in that state of mind. Yeah, rather than changing the state of mind to bring it up.

**Speaker B:** I think the attitude is like shock therapy there, like let's induce a bunch of voluntary suffering and maybe something will happen. I feel like that's— I feel like.

**Speaker A:** That'S a lot of meditation, right? So the attitude then becomes that I put in my dues.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Or that you owe me now because I have done the work that was necessary. And this fits into the cultural way of looking at it. And this is what the Buddha talks about in the Four Woeful States of the Animal. Now, when I was originally hearing about this, especially through the Gwanka— here's one of the points you asked about the Hinduism— was that people get the idea that they're going to be reborn as an ant or a fly or a bee or a worm or something really low. On the evolutionary scale. But actually what I've come to understand it to mean is the dumb animal is actually a draft animal, a domesticated machine that's designed to do work. The donkey that pulls the cart, this is the dumb animal. And how humans get into that state is like doing the first grade. The example is, well, the kid says, "Why should I have to learn the ABCs?" And mom will say, "So you can read." "Why should I read?" "So that you can learn stuff," OK, and all of this kind of stuff. But the mom never says to the kid, "Oh, you can learn the ABCs because you'll enjoy learning it, and I'll be really proud of you." which is the kind of thing that happens right here and now, so it's always future-oriented. So if you do the Goenka retreat and suffer through it, then later you'll get some value or some reward out of all the suffering that you've done. Well, guess what? Those draft animals— you've heard of the story of the carrot and stick, that you have the stick out on it with a string holding a carrot in front of the donkey, and so the donkey will try to get the carrot and will move forward and carry the the load. But if the donkey doesn't do that, then you take the carrot and the stick and beat the donkey with the stick. All right. And so the point is, is that the donkey never gets that carrot that's dangling in front of him. He never gets it. If he gets all the way to the destination and the driver will take the carrot put it in a box and put that same carrot out in front of the donkey tomorrow. And the donkey never gets any reward for what he's doing. So this is the way that many people practice, and it's very, very set up that way in the Goenka retreat, so that people don't get the benefit or the reward for their hard labor. And so the story is, I put in 10,000 hours, and the other guy says, well, I put in 50,000 hours. And then the guy says, well, I put in 100,000 hours of meditation, and all three of them are looking for some benefit from their meditation practice, almost as if the Kamma machine is going to waltz into the meditation hall, do some chanting and some Shakyapatra, and then they're going to feel good. Then they'll be in bliss because they're rewarded finally for all the hard work that they put in.

**Speaker B:** I think this is like how people rationalize a lot of stuff in life, just like everything. People in the West are surprisingly like believing in karma, like, oh, I should or shouldn't do this because of like universal law, which they really have no idea about.

**Speaker A:** Actually, the way that the Westerners look at karma is kind of different than they do in Asia, and the Westerners are highly, highly Christianized in the way of Christianity's teachings, in the sense of your reward is in heaven. You're going to have to wait a long time. You're going to have to wait for the bank to burn down before you can withdraw your money.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay. I think, uh, but would you say—.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Or would you say that like a lot of the suffering basically stems from like clinging to belief.

**Speaker A:** Oh, it's one of the four modes of clinging— clinging to views, the thicket of views.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And also it's our own personal territory. Our belief system is our own personal territory, which means then that we can apply this to an instinct, that we have a natural territorial instinct, that this land is my land, God gave it to me. Okay, so this is my religion, God gave that to me, or this is my science, or this is my point of view. And it very closely matches that territorial instinct, which is actually built right into our DNA.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, like a survival mechanism. Evolutionary.

**Speaker A:** It's evolutionary survival mechanism, but it's not liberating. Ah, we have a guest. Hello, what is your name?

**Speaker C:** Pañña.

**Speaker A:** Ah, thank you for joining. Where are you located? Right now I'm about an hour outside Bangkok. Oh, okay. Yeah. How long have you been ordained? Now is 5 years. Congratulations, you've made it over the hump.

**Speaker C:** Well, we'll see.

**Speaker A:** I'll see how it goes. You know, the traditional hump of 5 years, and after that, uh, you do not have to request permission from your Upajaya to travel anywhere that you want to go. Yeah. So most Westerners who ordain, they don't make it 5 years. Sure, sure. So congratulations on both those points. So today, uh, before you joined, we were talking about, um, the Satipatthana in its relationship to the Anapanasati Sutta, as well as Goenka and his method. Have you ever done a Goenka retreat? Yeah, yeah. Okay, so you'll know what we're talking about. The statement that I made earlier was that the schedule seems to be for very advanced students But the teachings and the way that they set it up, almost all the people in the retreat are beginners. And so it winds up being a kind of a boot camp as opposed to a— and I mean a military boot camp where there's a lot of up, 2, 3, 4, and a lot of suffering and a lot of stuff like that. And the students get into the idea that if you put in enough hours and suffer enough through your meditation, then there will be a reward there someplace in the future. To where the teachings actually of the Buddha from the perspective of, oh, let us say number 117, 118, 119, and several other sutras where the Buddha talks about removing unwholesome thoughts and making them wholesome thoughts, or the same thing would be the hindrances. And Goenka does not stress removal of the hindrances nearly the way that the Buddha would stress that. But in fact, in Sutta 117, with Sati, to remember to look at what we're doing with discernment, and then right effort to make a change, right then and there. That we don't practice and look at Dukkha and look at Dukkha for 5 years and then all of a sudden some inspiration will come, or maybe the Kamma machine will whack you with Shaktipat or something, and then we wake up and gain the benefit after all of that time, that in fact in the Anapanasati Sutra, The gladdening the mind is something that we do right away. We remove these hindrances very, very quickly. This is in fact the first practice that we have, is removing unwholesome thoughts and putting in wholesome thoughts, which means that the students are going to be getting benefit from their practice right now, that they can come out of their misery right now by focusing on something this positive. So, in this regard, the Western Buddhism has to do with delayed gratification, and that the actual teaching of the Buddha is no Dukkha, and Dukkha-Nirodha, coming out of that state of Dukkha right now, is the gratification. That we don't wait, that we come out of it immediately. So you could say then that the entire teaching of the Buddha is recognized as Dukkha, Nirodha. That's the only thing that the Buddha teaches. The way that it's taught and the way that it's practiced, and the way that Goenka and also the Mahasi method that's taught in the West, not necessarily from Mahasi Sayadaw, the monk. But the practice is Dukkha, Dukkha, Dukkha, more Dukkha, look at the Dukkha, deep dive into the Dukkha, see that this Dukkha is related to that Dukkha over there, and it's always insight into the.

**Speaker C:** Dukkha, but they never get into the.

**Speaker A:** Dukkha, Nirodha, that that's delayed. To where in the actual teaching of the Buddha, no, as soon as you see the Dukkha, you end it right then and there. Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. And so if we practice that over and over again, we begin to get very good at being in a state of no Dukkha. And so this is what I learned from Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, was that no, the value of your practice is immediate. That if you go into an hour session with Goenka, they go in reluctantly and they come out really exhausted, really tired, and really frustrated. But if they're practicing correctly, they can go into it, into the practice, into the hour sitting happily and get even more happy throughout that hour sitting. Go ahead, Daniel.

**Speaker B:** You think there's value though to the strong determination thing? Because I would notice like I finish an hour-long sit without moving and I feel like, wow, like I pushed through that. And I was observant of the pain, but like sort of practiced being neutral, and I sort of like gained a little control over my mind. So you think there's no value to that?

**Speaker A:** Well, yes, in fact, we're next. I was going back to the Eightfold Noble Path. We have Sati and Ditti are actually the investigation and then putting in the right effort Now, you're putting in effort, let us not say that it's exactly right effort, but you are putting in some effort and getting some result. And then, the fourth item on the list is Samma Sanghappa, which is referred to as right intention. I would translate it better as right attitude, and there is where you are, you're changing your attitude from "I can't do this, this is really difficult," into "Wow, I can do it.".

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's wholesome.

**Speaker A:** And so let us say that we could get that "Wow, I can do it" feeling from a better practice in the sense of you wake up, or Sati, you remember to take a deep breath, you remember to change this hindrance from "Oh, I don't like this" into, wow, I can handle this. And we use those words and change the mind state. So then Sutta number 117 in the Great Forty out of the Majjhima Nikaya is spoken like this, that Sati and Mudita and Viriya, or right effort, run in circle. These three run in circle around each other. Are you going to leave us? Yeah, I have to go. Someone just arrived here. Thank you. I would really like it if you came back.

**Speaker C:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I will come back sometime. Excellent. Well, we do this on this time of day on Saturday morning every week. So good. We'll see you. So, with this right effort, cycling around with Sati, that the stronger our Sati is, the easier it is to do the effort. And with the right effort, these are skills that are being developed. And with right effort, with looking, to wake up, take a look at what you're doing, and make a change. Wake up, take a look at what you're doing, and making a change. And these three things run around each other, and then the fourth item comes in with the confidence that I can do this process, I can remove these hindrances, I can get my mind straight. And that's when that competence, that Shraddha, comes into Samma Sanghappa, or the right attitude. We're actually changing the state of mind now into "I can do it, I can do this." And so this is why we have this quality of repetition. Doing the right thing over and over and over and over again is a completely different thing than putting in a whole lot of work and then expecting some results of that. So an example that I would use would be like going to the gym and lifting weights. That what the practitioner does, and in fact the new student, they're given little dumbbells like 2 kilograms, which are for the beginner kind of heavy, but then they do repetitions over and over and over and over and over again to build those muscles. But when they're going to be lifting great big barbells with huge amounts of weight, they don't do that much. They don't do repetitions of 200 kilograms. A guy getting 400 pounds in the air is a one-time shot, and he's kind of done for the day. And this is the way that meditation is practiced, is giving the students very, very heavy weights to lift when they don't have the muscles to do that, the mental muscles.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so it's the repetition of little weight over and over and over again that will build up those muscles so that occasionally a disaster will happen and then we'll have the strength to handle that disaster, like mom dies or divorce or losing one's job or your guru dies or something like this. Those are big occasions that are not frequent. We may have the muscle power, the mental muscle power to do that, only because we've done the small amounts of weight over and over and over again. So this is the actual practice, is that let's get secluded, let's get away from all the big problems of life and go into a secluded place where we can practice repetition of just changing these thoughts from unwholesome thoughts to wholesome thoughts. Very, very lightweight stuff to do over and over and over again. But in fact, if the students will change their mind from an unwholesome thought to a wholesome thought, they will eventually start changing their mind or their attitude. And I've had a lot of students who come and say, well, I keep having wholesome thoughts, but I don't feel wholesome yet. And the answer to that is, we'll keep practicing. You're not ready for that 100-pound or 100-kilo barbell right now. Let's still practice and rep with the 1 or 2-kilogram dumbbells.

**Speaker B:** I think it's less about even the thoughts but more about just creating like a general wholesome state. I mean, just like mindlessly saying words over and over doesn't really do anything. It's more about just relaxing and like consciously, like your whole system, just making it good as opposed to not dwelling.

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker B:** So the worst— Noting in the Vipassana is good because you strengthen the looking muscles. So that is very useful. And they do talk about that, but it's just not as obvious as it could be, probably to beginners.

**Speaker A:** So they do develop some muscle. They develop, in fact, Sati. They also develop the looking or the investigation. What they're not developing is the right effort. Those muscles are not developed. And what is the right effort is to change our thoughts, to change our attitude.

**Speaker B:** They talk about like real peace, they can find, we can find it in things that in basically developing the equanimity of mind, where basically good things, bad things come and go, but we cultivate a peaceful and wholesome state of mind by just rolling with the punches.

**Speaker A:** Okay, but my question is— That's a good point. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. What I mean, like there's a lot of talk about like grounding ourselves in the truth and like the objective reality. That's like a big theme in Buddhism. And that was, to the defense of Goenka a little bit, that was like heavily emphasized, that we should just drop the stories, drop what's between our ears, and get back to like the objective sensations. And that, that's, that will be lasting, that won't go anywhere, that will be like something we can be anchored to. And not be disturbed.

**Speaker A:** Right. So there is just the thread, or the very tiny little bit of the Samma Sanghappa, is because if the people will remove the unwholesome thoughts, eventually they might stumble on the fact that they can have instead wholesome thoughts. And so they're doing a little bit of right effort, but not much right effort.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you don't want to become— I think that is the problem with the whole equanimity thing, where it's like, oh, I'm totally equanimous, I can't even like take action, like I can't even change stuff, you know, I can't even make changes for the better because I'm just being totally neutral.

**Speaker A:** That is— but they're not generally totally neutral. They, when they say they can't change stuff, that's almost a loser's attitude because they really do want to change stuff.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, of course. Why else are they sitting there?

**Speaker A:** Exactly. And so equanimity, I don't think should even be taught to the beginners in the Goman Kha course.

**Speaker B:** I don't think it's being like observed in its— what it was meant by whatever Buddhist master or whatever. It's kind of just being used as a placeholder for, uh, as like a practice tip, like just try to be accepting. But Anapanasati is like a whole other thing. I don't even think anybody experienced it on the whole retreat.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, let's look at it from the perspective— you used the term a moment ago of roll with the punches, right? Okay, well, now guess what? There's a whole variety of punches that it's really, really hard to roll with a big slug in the head. Yeah, right. But it's easy enough to roll with it with a gentle slap.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So that's back to the point about doing the repetition with the small dumbbells, is that we can learn to roll with little punches, then we can learn to roll with a little bit bigger punches, and pretty soon we can learn to roll with the haymakers. All right. But within the Goenka retreat, they start throwing— or the students start to themselves throwing great big haymakers. Right from the very beginning. Yeah, but the Dhamma doesn't recommend that. In fact, that whole story about getting into seclusion to get away from it all, which means to get away from all the heavy-duty punches so that we can start learning to deal happily with the little slaps.

**Speaker B:** So you think that's the value of ordaining as a monk, that you just get to basically practice the fundamentals of Dhamma, and because the challenges and like the conditions of life are too much to develop like a solid skill. Because I have this discussion in my head, it's like, yeah, you can become a monk and it'll probably be like easy. You're just basically on retreat all life, all your life. Well, there's two sides to it, right? People think that being a monk is challenging, and in a sense it is. But in another sense, when you're not.

**Speaker A:** Ready for it, right, right.

**Speaker B:** And yeah, but in another sense, it's easy because you're not dealing with all the challenges and pursuits of the householder's life. But wouldn't a householder possibly be better off because they have more opportunities to practice? What's your take on all that?

**Speaker A:** All right, so let's look at it from this perspective. There is a sutta, number 48, the Gosambhyan Sutta, where the Buddha talks about the stages of practice. And one of the later stages is that when the monk is only interested in the Dhamma, he's Dhamma full-time. So even if he's sweeping the grounds, he's still thinking about the Dhamma. Or another example on that same thing is a mother cow will look after her calf, but she's got one eye open while she's eating. So she's eating grass or she's doing whatever she's doing, but she's looking after that calf. She's got an eye on the calf. Yeah. Okay. Most people, Westerners especially, when they get into Buddhism They only think about Buddhism maybe once or twice a day.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. And so the point for the monk is, is that when people get so deep into the Dharma that they want to actually say, I got nothing else to do with my life other than Dharma. And I have a lot of friends in here on the list that have wound up here in Thailand. To check out these deeper kinds of things. So, if someone for the wrong reason ordains too quickly, then that ordination he's not ready for, and it's a great big challenge for him. But if somebody has already come to the point of wanting to be a monk, then when he does ordain, he's ready for that deep kind of seclusion. Yeah, okay. So this is the way— it's kind of a process. And that some people, in fact most of the Westerners, ordained too early. They don't stay monks and they quit it because it was too much for them, that they didn't have this one time.

**Speaker B:** We were having— yeah, sorry, go ahead.

**Speaker A:** They didn't have the skills to be focused on the Dharma all the time. And so the monks then are looking for motorcycle magazines or looking for pornography. They're looking for all kinds of things to distract them because they're nearly not really fully deeply into the Dhamma yet. So that's the time for someone to ordain, is when they've got nothing better to do.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but how would you— how would you call it?

**Speaker A:** You know, how would I call it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, how would you call it? Like, how do you know when it's right? Versus the— because you could be really into like the Dhamma, uh, or I don't know, one time we were having a conversation and we were talking about like the same topic because I've brought it up many times, and, uh, you were like, maybe it could be more wholesome to join the military, because we were talking about the military. It could be more wholesome to do something like that because you gain that attitude of, I can do this. Like, is it possible that— and this is a common critique of ordaining as a monk— is that it might be a cop-out? Like, it might be too easy? That it might be more beneficial to your progress on whatever development to like be— to just be a layperson, even if you understand the Dhamma?

**Speaker A:** In any regard, It's the repetition. It's the building up of the muscles, the mental muscles of remembering to take a look, to make a change and congratulate yourself. So when people are saying that it's a cop-out, those are ordinary people who were saying, why should he have to get a break and not have to have a job when I have to? And that's just a bad attitude on the behalf of the people on the outside. That's not an inside thing.

**Speaker B:** Uh, with like having a job or whatever, having a family, all that stuff, wouldn't that be better? Wouldn't that be more rigorous and like fruitful training for looking and cultivating wholesome?

**Speaker A:** Yes, except going back to that, that when people are in the lay life, they get too many haymakers that they're not ready Yeah. All right. And so if the layperson will practice and will practice and does practice and keeps practicing, he goes through then the twofold process of one is that he can handle the haymakers easier, but then he also gets the attitude, why should I have to deal with these haymakers when I really could go off into seclusion and be to be a monk. That's the difference, okay, is that in lay life, yes, there's some big problems to have to solve, mainly because almost all of the people who are around you are ordinary people slugging it out with each other. And so getting into seclusion so that we can start handling the tiny little slaps of the bad attitudes and the worries that we have and start having a wholesome mind state. By having that wholesome mind state, like I said, this twofold process is one is that we want to get away from the world, that we want to do Dharma, that we don't want to deal with ordinary people who were slugging it out with each other. We want to get away from that and get around noble people, get around the monks. Who are not slugging it out with each other. Then when we can refine it or get the little stuff done, the residue— so you could say then that the big stuff always comes up and manifests itself as hindrances in the moment, the really heavy-duty bad feelings we have because of events and whatnot. But if we can get out of that arena and get around really, really wholesome people, then we can begin to refine or fine-tune. Just like modern carpenters will use various grades of sandpaper so that they can get a very, very rough edge down to a smoother edge. But if they go all the way down to buffing by doing a 600-grade and then a 300-grade and then a 100-grade and then start buffing it, they can actually get it to polish. You can polish wood, but you can't polish it with the buffer when it needs the heavy sandpaper to start with. Okay. Okay. So you can see then that the world is really heavy-duty sandpaper. And yes, you can get quite a lot done, but you need to have more refined sandpaper in order to get the real polish job done, getting free from what we call the underlying tendencies, getting rid of the fetters themselves rather than having to deal with the slugfest.

**Speaker B:** Right, so going to the source, doing the fundamentals. Is that kind of what you mean by the little things?

**Speaker A:** Well, guess what? It's always the fundamentals.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** It's always the fundamentals in the sense of, um, we're not going to be able to deal with Grandma's death unless we're dealing with gladdening the mind before then, that we can in fact deal with Grandma's death, the big slugs, if we can keep practicing gladdening the mind and gladdening the mind, and when we find out that Granny's dead, we can gladden the mind right now. Instead of having, oh, I miss her, we can have, oh, she was a wonderful old lady, may she rest in peace, she's better off now. Okay, so this is the way we can start handling those thoughts. But when someone is a monk too soon, then having nothing to do is quite a challenge. And in fact, that's one of the statements that I had with Eric, and he got the point immediately. Here was the situation. Due to visa issues, he wound up in a forest wat, a tiny little town with a tiny little wat in Laos. And he communicates to me is that all he wants to go to a bigger wat or a better wat because the wat that he's in is not a challenge for him. And my answer to that is, oh, so not having a challenge is a challenge for you. Yeah, he got it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, that's definitely true. On the meditation retreat, the Goenka retreat, you realize that you're attached even to like work. And like stress and exercise and all this like stuff people usually view as just unfavorable, you know, unagreeable. But even that, where we cling to it because it just fits, because basically it comforts deeper things that we're attached to, like beliefs and like states of mind, something like that.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And look at all the examples that we have that this is one of the values of becoming a monk and getting away from it all, is now you're dealing with people who have gotten away from it all. And so they can sort of refine each other. Let us say that if you come down from a 600-grain to a 300-grain, or whatever the way that they deal with sandpaper, smoother objects will smooth each other. But if you put a really smooth object and you put a very heavy, grainy thing on it, that graininess will not be smoothed out by the smoother. In fact, the graininess will dig into the smoother part. Okay. Okay. So with that, it's better than for a beginner, let us say a student of the Dhamma to be around nobles. This is what the Buddha recommended for the issue of the Sangha, is let's not associate with people who are not good for us. Let us not. So many, many examples of that in real life. One of them is chess. If you have a very, very high quality chess player, maybe a master, and you have a beginner that beginner will get better by playing the master, because the master will point things out and teach him along the way. But while he's doing that, the master gets sloppy. The master gets really sloppy because he is not being up to the level of the challenge of the chess. So Grandmaster should pay So beginners should play with people who are better than them, but grandmasters need to play against grandmasters, someone at your own level.

**Speaker B:** But you agree it's probably not the best thing to rush into ordination? And like, you think there's any harm to waiting?

**Speaker A:** Well, are you talking about it from an Asian mentality or from a Western mentality? You see, I think from a Western.

**Speaker B:** Mentality Yes, we know, we've discussed, they go in and out as they please.

**Speaker A:** But I feel like if you— and they have support from their family and they have support for their community. Yeah, it in fact is quite common. I've actually seen it to where a guy goes to his boss and says, I'm going to ordain and I'm going to be ordained for 3 months. And the guy says, I'll see you when you get back.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and it's okay. It's like a normal thing there.

**Speaker A:** Normal thing. A Westerner goes into his boss and says, I'm going to Thailand and ordain 3 months. And the boss will say, good luck, goodbye.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. So there's a difference in the mentality that the family, the community, the bosses all support the Asians. With the Westerners, oftentimes he's in conflict with his family.

**Speaker B:** About his order. There's just the pressure. There's just the feeling once you learn about all this stuff that like nothing is more important than sort of like spiritual progress.

**Speaker A:** Ah, but very few people have that attitude.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well then, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** In the West, very few people are, or they think of— it's not spiritual. Buddhism is of the devil.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so you have that, that, that issue. And so, um, uh, by the way, the Buddha recommends, and that in Thailand is actually enforced, that the Abbot or the, uh, Upaya or the Anicca who is going to be assisting in your ordination, they will will insist that they— it's proven to them that you have your mother's permission.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And that's, for the Westerner, sometimes hard to come by because mom doesn't want him to go to Asia or to go to Wat Wat and get away from it all, because I'm the me that's the all that he wants to get away from, is the attitude. To where in Thailand, the story is, is that the mother rides to heaven on the coattails of the robe. Yeah. Okay. And so moms in Asia want their sons to ordain as Buddhist monks. In the West, the moms don't want the boys to ordain. And so there's that additional issue. But there The idea then is that Westerners don't ordain because it's part of the culture. They've got to really be dedicated. Yeah. Very rarely do you have a Westerner who is going to ordain. He may not be ready for it, but he's at least gung-ho to do it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** To where in Thailand, the monks who ordain do it out of family obligation. They do it out of social and whatnot like that. And then they're gung-ho for the Dhamma. Will go after they ordained.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so this is part of the reason why the Westerners don't last in the Dharma, is because they have the gung-ho attitude, but they don't have the skills to deal with nothing at all, the way that Eric was talking about, that having nothing to do was quite frustrating to him.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** Because he was used to having a job, doing what he was told to do, etc. So the bigger issue then is that if the Westerner, when he wants to ordain, doesn't have the skills that he needs to ordain. What are the skills that he needs? Well, he already needs to practice being in seclusion, maybe not weeks at a time, but a few minutes at a time, a few hours at a time, to get away from it all. That in fact, the seclusion is kind of artificial. When the students do a Goenka retreat, the Buddha recommends go to the forest, go to the foot of a tree, go to an empty hut, go to a pile of straw, get away from the village, get away from it all, and then bring Sati to the fore. Practice Sati, practice remembering to look at what we're doing, make a change, and congratulate ourselves. This is the Eightfold Noble Path. So when we practice that, we're gaining some value immediately, And if we practice it well enough, we begin to see, wait a minute, I would rather do that than anything else. And now he's ready to ordain is because he's gotten that gung-ho attitude about it.

**Speaker B:** I think that's the way to do it, because if you just read about it and you go for it, that might be bad. But let's say you spent like a few, maybe a decade even, just for good measure, and you really delight in like the Dhamma, and you've kind of like distanced yourself from Western values. And then you just naturally find that, hey, going to live at a monastery would be just easy. It would just be pleasant. Yeah, a great way to continue what I like to do.

**Speaker A:** That would be a good way.

**Speaker B:** And I'm happy to let go of everything. That would be the natural way to do it.

**Speaker A:** That would be the excellent way to do it. And not only the additional benefit is now that you're getting away from all of that slugfest, now you're putting down the heavyweight. Putting down that heavy weight of society, and now we can go to the temple, go to the wat, and associate with all of those other people who have put down that burden of life and are in retreat and seclusion. So, getting back to the point about the retreats, is that the retreats are artificial in the sense that they're not really secluded. You're supposed to have noble silence, they say, which means to ignore everybody else. But that's not what the Buddha teaches. He doesn't teach. Yeah, right. So he doesn't teach to deal with people by ignoring them like you have at a meditation retreat, but rather that when you're in retreat yourself, away from everybody, when you're in seclusion, you practice those repetitions to get the strength so that you can go back and deal with the ordinary people. All right. So if the Goenka retreat goes and the retreat itself is heavy duty, it's got a heavy schedule. You're not in retreat. If you went to the forest, to the foot of a tree, you can just bring bibles to the poor and you can take it easy, relax, and everything is really nice. Yeah, but if you go to retreat, oh no, you've got a schedule. They ring those bells. You've got to be here and do what I tell you to do.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, when people think of the word retreating, they don't think of that. They don't think of boot camp. They think of retreating, you know.

**Speaker A:** A retreat should be a retreat, not a boot camp.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so that's where the Goenka retreat system— that's why it is so let us say, non-functioning. Instead of going into the retreat and people come out all blissed out and everything is so happy and fine because I've changed all of that mind state, I've come out of that loser's attitude into the winner's attitude and all of that, to where people go into these retreats, these heavy retreats, and they come out of the retreat, "Oh, I'm so glad to get out of that retreat." Relief is the day of the end of the retreat rather than the whole retreat long. And so they have the attitude, I don't want to go back there again, that's tough work, because of the schedules being so hard.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so the students are challenged in a way that they don't need to be challenged. They're challenged in those Goenka retreats the way that they're challenged in boot camp or in the Army. They're challenged in the Goenka retreats the same way that they're challenged in university. The boot camp retreats are very much like a heavy-duty slugfest.

**Speaker B:** To their credit though, someone who's really lost in just the Western life, even that little 10-day thing, guys I talked to who have jobs and families notice the difference of living a life where you've just completely withdrawn from normal pursuits. One guy was telling me, like, on day 5 or 6, I just smiled and I, like, understood what monks are up to. You know, when you drop all these things, all these things you want, all these things you're going to do, and you're just— nothing to do, nowhere to go, like you say.

**Speaker A:** Nothing to do and no place to go. Exactly.

**Speaker B:** And realizing that for the first time, even that could be powerful for people. And there is a benefit to the hard work as well. Yeah, but the message might be garbled, right?

**Speaker A:** Okay, so there are various ways to look at it in the refinement. And if the student, for instance, on day 6, this guy had that— generally day 6, by the way, in the Goenka retreats is the low spot. It may have been in fact day 7 when he came out of that low spot. The day 7 is generally because now in day 6 you're wearing down. That's like the middle of the retreat. You've got about half of it done and it's taken the micky out of you. All right. But day 7, you can see light at the end of the tunnel. Oh, this is almost finished. I can handle this now. And so the attitude is changed naturally instead of the right way for it to have is for the for the teacher to encourage them to make that mental change, to make the change of, "Oh, here you are in a retreat and you've got no place to go and nothing to do. Why don't you just sit and enjoy it?".

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Practice enjoy sitting here rather than practicing trying to get it done.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, more of that would have been good instead of just kind of the workout, the exercise boot camp mentality.

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm.

**Speaker B:** And also a big emphasis on like putting in the work and not really.

**Speaker A:** Like enjoying and not enjoying it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And you do both. Well, actually, that would be the actual normal way of doing it is that you get the benefit from the work when you're doing the work. In the real world, you can say that would be the difference between a cooperative or self-employment versus working for a big corporation. If you're working for a big corporation, then you're going to get your promotions after a long time of putting in all of the work, and all the work, and all the work, and finally you get a raise, and things like this. To where the cooperative, they share the profits among themselves for the work that they're actually doing. Okay, so in this regard, we're getting the benefit for the actions that we're taking immediately rather than having to go through delayed gratification. Yeah, it's very Western for us to go through delayed gratification, that we put in the work and we don't get the reward for it. This is what the Buddha refers to as the woeful state of being an animal. We train our kids in that in first grade, that you're not supposed to enjoy first grade. None of the first graders really enjoy first grade. They actually play in playschool, and in kindergarten, they enjoy that. And a little bit of education is done along with that, but when they go into first grade, we have to sit down in a classroom. We have to do what we're told to do. We have to pay attention to the teacher. Put in the homework and all of that kind of stuff. And that's when the delayed gratification comes in. And so our life turns out from being the young child who is enjoying playing through his life— now he's a student and he has to work through life. And after he gets out of school, never mind how much school he's got, when he gets a job, now he has to work through that life. And the whole point then of the Goenka retreats is— in fact, Goenka uses the word, 'You gotta work, you gotta work,' rather than, 'Hey guys, you're here to relax and enjoy.'.

**Speaker B:** Here, look, this is my stepmom.

**Speaker A:** Hi. Hello. Hi, how are you? I cannot see anything above your mouth. I'm a little bit of nose. Yeah, hi. Hello, good to meet you. How are you? Everything is okay, everything is happy. Where are you? Thailand, and on Koh Phangan, a small island off the east coast of Thailand, southern Thailand. Wonderful. Yes, it's a party island. Are you doing much partying yourself? Oh, I'm partying right now. Nice.

**Speaker C:** Who's this?

**Speaker A:** Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** Thailand guy. This is my dad.

**Speaker A:** Hi. Hi, how are you? Oh, now I know what's going on. Okay, what is going on, huh?

**Speaker C:** What is going on?

**Speaker A:** Skin color. Oh, and now I see everything. I see the whole story.

**Speaker C:** Well, yes, that is correct. I'm the winner on the skin color scale though, I'll point out.

**Speaker A:** I know you've got more of it than any of them.

**Speaker C:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Where are you from? Where were you born?

**Speaker C:** I was born in New Delhi, India.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh, okay.

**Speaker C:** My father and mother are from the south of India.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker C:** My mother is from the west coast of India, from the state of Kerala.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker C:** My father is from the east coast of India, from the state of Tamil Nadu.

**Speaker A:** Tamil Nadu, I spent a lot of time in Tamil Nadu. Yes, I've been into Madras, and in fact, there was a teacher down there, Mother something or another, that I went to visit.

**Speaker C:** Oh, so my father is from Madras, so he grew up there, and now known as Chennai. And my— because they've changed all the names. And now my mother— and my mother's from the other side of the peninsula, the West Coast, so to speak. But most of my life I spent in New Delhi.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, your accent indicates that you've been in the West for a number of years.

**Speaker C:** I have been out of India since 1987. So yes, that is correct.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's nice to meet you. I'm having a lot of— and in fact, I also have noticed his last name, though he's only got an R, but I've heard it is a very Indian last name.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yes, it's a— what is it?

**Speaker A:** Ramaswamy. Ramaswamy. I did remember it correctly.

**Speaker C:** Yes, yes. So it's a It's a great pleasure to finally talk to you. Daniel has mentioned you a number of times, and I know he's been talking to you for a while, so it's great to see you finally and chat with you.

**Speaker A:** Well, I'm glad to meet you.

**Speaker C:** Go ahead.

**Speaker A:** I'm also very, very pleased that the parents— you see, a lot of the students that I have, the moms and dads don't want their students into Buddhism. Why?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, we have no such concerns. I believe that knowledge is universal and there is no fear of knowledge. It is not a good thing. So knowledge takes many forms. I am happy that you are imparting some of it to young Daniel here. And we have talked about even coming and I spent a lot of time in Singapore and Malaysia, and Daniel and I have been talking about coming one of these, one of these years. No, no, no commitment yet, but coming down there and paying you a visit.

**Speaker A:** I would like that. Currently there are a number of students in Thailand right now, that I've had 3 students ordained. One of them, a guy named David, has just ordained this week.

**Speaker C:** Excellent.

**Speaker A:** Um, and that we have students doing retreat, um, on a regular basis. So, um, Laurent, Nor, David, Daniel, Cathal, Vinaya, Eric, uh, that's all— that's how many students that are here in Thailand right now, that there were few coming during the COVID But now that COVID is over, people are coming and doing the retreats. We have a lot of retreat centers and a lot of wats here in Thailand for people to go and visit and get around real monks, really noble, high-quality people.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, we look forward to experiencing that at some point in the future.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, where do you live? What— where's your location?

**Speaker C:** So we're in San Diego in California.

**Speaker A:** Okay. All right, around San Diego there is a Wat Metta, uh, Achan Thanissaro, and there's also other Thai wats in Southern California. And so that would be— yeah, there's.

**Speaker B:** Lao, there's a couple of Lao wats. I've only seen Lao ones, and there's a Thich Nhat Hanh one nearby.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the Vietnamese, the Deer Park. I've been to the Deer Park Monastery a couple times. I think the teachings are fantastic, just.

**Speaker B:** Everyday life of simplicity and humility and detachment.

**Speaker A:** I highly recommend people in the West, in the United States, to find the various temples. You see, because of the Vietnam War, There were a lot of refugees that eventually came here from that. And so there are millions of Vietnamese, millions of Laotians, hundreds of thousands of Thai people. And so over the years, they have developed and built wats. Right now, in fact, the latest that I've heard is there are approximately 1,000 Buddhist temples or wats in the United States. That blows my mind. Yeah, because I haven't been to all of them.

**Speaker C:** Yes, I've only been to about 50. Let me put it this way, the United States is sorely in need of a return to simplicity and clear thinking.

**Speaker A:** I know, I know. But the media and the politics in the United States does not support that. And not only that, but neither do the religions. The religion should in fact support that. That was what the original point was about Christianity. Jesus was quite a teacher of that.

**Speaker C:** The religions have been transformed into businesses, which is a problem.

**Speaker A:** I would not agree with that. They haven't been transformed into businesses. They've been transformed into political parties.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, close enough. Yes, I agree. Yes.

**Speaker A:** I agree. And so getting back to that easygoing simplicity, I mean, look how many miserable people, no matter how much money they can attain, they still are miserable. They don't have the feeling of satisfaction with their lives. They're always wanting something. And this is what I'm working with Bhikkhuni Daniel, to teach him how to be satisfied with the way things are right now.

**Speaker C:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** We can handle things.

**Speaker C:** We're grateful for your instruction of Daniel, and I try to add a little voice to that occasionally, because it's simplicity and freedom from desire. Is really the key to happiness.

**Speaker A:** Well, I would agree with you 100%, but I would add something to that, and that is that this is something that most people miss out on anyway, is that there are some things that are worth desiring. There are some wholesome things that are worth desiring. So we don't— a lot of people get caught into in the West of desiring desirelessness. But I wouldn't say that desirelessness is the state that we want to be into, but rather satisfaction would be the state that we want to be in, basically because the desires that we have are wholesome desires. Yes, rather than unwholesome desire.

**Speaker C:** Absolutely. Absolutely. All right. We let you return to your lesson here.

**Speaker A:** All right. I am so happy to meet you. Thank you. Come on. Great meeting you. Nice to meet you. Okay, bye-bye. Thank you, Daddy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that was fun.

**Speaker A:** So this has been about an hour and 20 minutes as, uh, we've been— I'm, I'm really glad to see you again, Daniel, and I hope to see you again soon. And I hope that what we've talked about today has been all over the map, because that's what a dialogue would be rather than a particular teaching discussion with participants.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we covered a lot of ground.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So does any— do you have anything to say?

**Speaker B:** No, we covered some good topics, good review. I'm glad I got to talk about my retreat. I hadn't talked to anybody.

**Speaker A:** So, Miguel, I see that you're still on. If you have any comments or anything to say. Nope. All right, so thank you all for coming. We'll see you later. Bye-bye. Okay, bye-bye. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends including Daniel (Speaker B) and others, is a wide-ranging dialogue that critically examines the Goenka Vipassana retreat system and contrasts it with core Buddhist principles, particularly as taught by Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **1. Critique of the Goenka Retreat System**
*   **Brutal Schedule for Beginners:** The schedule, originating in Burma for advanced practitioners, is applied to mostly first-time retreatants. This "ferocious" or "boot camp" approach is seen as a "trial by fire" that can be counterproductive.
*   **Low Return Rate:** Statistics suggest a long gap (often around 7 years) before people attend a second retreat, which Dhammarato attributes to the difficult experience.
*   **Delayed Gratification & "Draft Animal" Mentality:** The system is criticized for promoting suffering now for a future reward, akin to a donkey chasing a carrot it never gets. This is contrasted with the Buddha's teaching of immediate relief from *dukkha* (suffering/stress).
*   **Missing Core Buddhist Teachings:** The Goenka method is said to overlook or underemphasize essential teachings like the **Eightfold Noble Path** and the **Seven Factors of Enlightenment** (*Sambojjhanga*).
*   **Historical & Cultural Context:** Dhammarato provides context: Goenka, an Indian student of U Ba Khin, was deported from Burma after only a few years of training. The 10-day format was designed for Burmese government workers on leave. The system retains some Hindu influences and was shaped by early Indian practitioners' devotional practices.

### **2. Core Dhamma: The Buddha's Direct Path**
*   **Anapanasati vs. Satipatthana:** Dhammarato, following Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, elevates the **Anapanasati Sutta** (Mindfulness of Breathing) as the Buddha's primary meditation instruction. The *Satipatthana Sutta* is seen as a companion text, with the Goenka/Mahasi "noting" practice derived from it.
*   **Immediate Relief from Dukkha:** The true practice is **Dukkha-Nirodha**—ending suffering *in the present moment*. One should recognize *dukkha* and use right effort to change the mind state *immediately*, not just observe it endlessly.
*   **The "Muscle Building" Analogy:** Effective practice is like lifting light weights with high repetitions. One builds mental "muscles" (mindfulness, investigation, right effort) by repeatedly changing unwholesome thoughts to wholesome ones in seclusion. This prepares one for life's "haymakers" (major crises). Goenka's method is seen as making people lift heavy weights (intense schedule) without proper conditioning.
*   **The Role of Gladdening the Mind:** A key practice from Anapanasati is actively gladdening and calming the mind, changing its state toward wholesomeness and happiness *during* meditation, not just enduring frustration.

### **3. The Eightfold Path and Enlightenment Factors**
*   **The Cycle of Sati, Investigation, and Effort:** These three factors of the path reinforce each other. **Sati** is framed as "remembering to remember"—repetitively bringing attention back, like striking a drum to make music.
*   **Right Attitude (Samma Sankappa):** This develops from the confidence gained by successfully changing one's mind state. It shifts from "I can't do this" to "I can handle this."
*   **Enlightenment Factors as a "Done-That" List:** The **Seven Factors of Enlightenment** (e.g., persistent mindfulness, investigation) are the natural result of mastering the **Eightfold Path**. They are the qualities of a developed mind, not just more techniques.

### **4. On Monasticism (Ordination)**
*   **Purpose of Seclusion:** The goal of monastic life or retreat is to withdraw from the "slugfest" of worldly life to refine the mind with "fine sandpaper," dealing with subtler hindrances.
*   **Right Timing for Ordination:** One should ordain not to escape but when the Dhamma is the primary interest in life—when there's "nothing better to do." Westerners often ordain too early without the mental skills to handle the simplicity and lack of external challenge, leading them to leave.
*   **Cultural Differences:** In Asia, ordination is often supported by family and community (seen as making merit). In the West, it can be met with resistance and lacks that social support system.

### **5. Concluding Reflections**
*   **Value in the Goenka Retreat:** Daniel notes that even the difficult retreat can offer a powerful glimpse of a life free from worldly pursuits, which can be transformative for someone deeply entangled in "Western life."
*   **The Essence of Practice:** The discussion concludes by emphasizing that true practice is about finding **satisfaction in the present**, cultivating wholesome desires, and building the skill to handle life's challenges through repeated, gentle application of the Dhamma, not through harsh endurance.

**Overall Theme:** The talk advocates for a joyful, immediate, and skill-building approach to Dhamma practice based on the Anapanasati Sutta and the Eightfold Path, contrasting it with the austere, effort-heavy, and delayed-gratification model perceived in the Goenka Vipassana tradition.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key metaphors and stories used:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Trial by Fire / Boot Camp:** Used to describe the intense, grueling nature of the Goenka retreat schedule. Speaker B says it's "like a trial by fire" and the intention is to "make it so brutal that it leaves a mark." Speaker A later explicitly calls it a "boot camp" as opposed to a true retreat.

2.  **The Carrot and the Stick (The Donkey):** This is a central, extended metaphor used by Speaker A to critique the "delayed gratification" model he sees in systems like Goenka's and in Western/Christian thinking.
    *   **The Donkey:** Represents the meditator (or any person) performing hard labor.
    *   **The Carrot:** Represents the promised future reward (enlightenment, heavenly reward, benefit from meditation).
    *   **The Stick:** Represents the present suffering and discipline.
    *   **The Point:** The donkey never actually gets the carrot; the reward is always deferred. This is compared to the idea of putting in "10,000 hours" of painful meditation expecting a future payoff, rather than finding immediate benefit.

3.  **Mental Muscle Building (Gym & Weights):** Used to contrast effective vs. ineffective practice.
    *   **Effective Practice:** Like lifting light weights (2kg dumbbells) with many **repetitions**. This builds the "mental muscles" (Sati, right effort) gradually through small, manageable changes in mind state.
    *   **Ineffective Practice:** Like trying to lift a massive barbell (400 lbs) right away. This is what the intense Goenka schedule does—it gives beginners a weight they can't handle, leading to frustration instead of skill development.

4.  **Music & Repetition:**
    *   **Piano Key / Drum:** Used to explain "unremitting mindfulness." Holding a piano key down creates a fading sound; true continuity comes from striking it repeatedly. Similarly, mindfulness is not a static "holding" of attention, but a repetitive "coming back" to the object—like beating a drum to make continuous music.

5.  **Sandpaper and Polishing Wood:** Used to explain the purpose of monastic life/seclusion.
    *   **The World / Lay Life:** Is like **coarse sandpaper**. It can handle big, rough problems ("haymakers").
    *   **Monastic Seclusion:** Is like **fine-grit sandpaper**. It allows for the refinement and "polishing" away of subtle underlying tendencies and fetters after removing the major roughness. You need both stages for a complete polish.

6.  **Chess Players:** Used to discuss spiritual community (Sangha).
    *   **Beginners** benefit from playing with **masters** (who can teach them).
    *   But **masters/grandmasters** need to play with **their peers** to stay sharp. If a master only plays beginners, they get "sloppy." Similarly, advanced practitioners need noble companions to maintain their level, not just be around beginners.

7.  **Territorial Instinct:** Clinging to beliefs and views is compared to an evolutionary "territorial instinct." Our belief system becomes "our own personal territory" that we defend instinctively.

### **Stories / Anecdotes**

1.  **The Story of Thad:** Speaker A shares a statistic from his friend Thad, the logistics manager at a Goenka center, that the average time between a first and second retreat is **7 years**, attributed to the "ferocious" schedule.

2.  **Goenka's Background and Deportation:** Speaker A tells the historical story of S.N. Goenka. He was an Indian student of U Ba Khin in Burma who was **deported in 1959** when Burma reshuffled its bureaucracy post-British rule. The key point is that he had only studied for a few years before being cut off from the full tradition, and later adapted teachings for an Indian/Hindu audience.

3.  **Origin of the 10-Day Schedule:** The story that the 10-day retreat format was designed for **adult Burmese government workers** (like U Ba Khin's accountants) who were given time off from **Friday evening to Monday morning**. It was meant for people already embedded in Buddhist culture, not total beginners.

4.  **The Mother Cow:** A brief story to illustrate the constant, background mindfulness of a dedicated practitioner. Like a mother cow eating grass but always keeping "one eye open" on her calf, a monk immersed in Dhamma is always mindful, even while doing chores.

5.  **Eric in Laos:** A short anecdote about a student (Eric) who was frustrated being in a small, unchallenging forest monastery (*wat*). Speaker A reframed his complaint, pointing out that **"not having a challenge is a challenge for you,"** highlighting the difficulty of adjusting to true seclusion.

6.  **The First Grader:** Used to illustrate how "delayed gratification" is ingrained from childhood. The child asks why they must learn ABCs, and the parent gives future-oriented answers ("so you can read... learn..."). The parent doesn't say, "You'll enjoy it," or "I'll be proud of you *now*." This trains the mindset of labor for a future reward.

**Overall Theme:** The metaphors and stories collectively build a critique of meditation systems that emphasize hard labor and delayed gratification, contrasting them with the speaker's interpretation of the Buddha's path as one of **immediate benefit**, **skillful repetition**, and **present-moment satisfaction** through the gradual development of mental faculties.
