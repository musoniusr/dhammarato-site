### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Started recording here. Yeah, that's great, man. For those of you watching the pre-recorded version of this, Thomas was just talking about how he was doing good being calm, but now he's adding some joy into it. That's great, man. And yeah, more awareness of what we're doing too. I was just listening to Food for or Food of the Heart by Ajahn Chah. Oh, welcome, Philip. And he was saying that when he was He was saying people that only are experiencing a calm and they're not really aware of it are missing out. Because a lot of even everyday people, you know, they can fall into states of calmness. And he was saying it's better to be in a state of calm awareness Because that state's not going to last forever. And can you be aware when it ends? And can you be satisfied with it if and when it ends? So I thought that was interesting. Anybody else have anything they want to talk about or have been thinking about Dhamma-wise?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, fear of the uncertain. Well, obviously you never fear that something good will happen, I guess, unless you're trying to remain unattached then. But obviously it's of all the things that can go wrong, you know, not you spilling a coffee or something like that, but just like the actual.

**Speaker C:** The.

**Speaker B:** Actual horrible stuff that can happen in this life.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. The most horrible thing that can actually happen is if we don't wake up to our ignorance and wake up to the Dukkha that surrounds us and change it, you know. Because if we're aware of aging, sickness, and death as part of reality, our culture developed, our society developed a culture that's a very fear-based culture that cultivates exactly what you're talking about. It cultivates, you know, turn on any news channel, you don't even have to seek out the news, it'll find you on social media. Oh, today in the Olympics, this scandal happened, or today Today there's this new flu that's out there. Everybody be afraid, be afraid, be very afraid of the uncertainty. But the truth of the matter is there's not much to be afraid of. If you can accept aging, sickness, and death as part of life, if you can remember to gladden the mind here and now, come back to the truth, come back to reality, the Dhamma, that everything is actually very perfect and peaceful right here, right now. Fear exists here. That's why the Buddha called it the Middle Way. Fear exists in the future and in the past, but right here there's peace. This past and this future is just bullshit. It's just illusions. And our society doesn't help us break these bad habits. It promotes and cultivates these bad habits. But if you notice them, like you're— it seems like you're noticing that you have some fear there of things that may or may not happen. That's very good, and you need to congratulate yourself that you had the ability to see those things. You know, not everybody does have the ability to see them. They're so used to their fear, they're so used to their paranoia, it's become like their clothing. They barely notice they even have it. Dragging that case of bricks with them, you know, that bag of bricks is still on their back and they don't see it even. But if you see it, then you could do something about it. It's just set it down, you know. We can't control what may or may not happen. That's superstitious beliefs. What will, what won't happen, who the fuck knows? I don't know. It doesn't mean that you just, oh, whatever happens, I want it to happen. No, it doesn't mean you want to get sick, you want to get bad stuff happening to you or your friends. Of course nobody wants that. But you can be okay with, like the Christians say almost, like it's in God's hands. It's in the universe's hands. It is what it is, and whatever will be will be. You know? Don't take it so personally. Don't take it so seriously, you know, just relax and don't try to attach to control, you know, because that's where a lot of our fear comes from, our inability to control reality. We want things the way we want them and we want it now, but it doesn't matter. There's rich people who suffer loss, there's rich people who get cancer, There's rich, famous who have gained everything, every ladder, rung of ladder you can climb in this country, in this world, they've climbed it. And it did not protect them from the things you're talking about. But what can protect you from fear is the Dhamma practice of remembering to look and change, the Noble Eightfold Path. What causes our Dukkha? The Buddha said, Negative attachments. What is the difference between a regular attachment and a negative attachment? The negative attachment causes dissatisfaction. And what is a negative attachment? There's only really one negative attachment. It stems from all attachments. We want things to be different than the way they are. We want, or we want what we can't have, to put it another way. So the Buddha said, there's the truth. If you cling to things, you will suffer. You will have dissatisfaction. You'll have Dukkha. Hi, buddy. Aurelien. Aurelien.

**Speaker D:** Yes, Aurelien. But yeah.

**Speaker A:** Aurelien. Okay, cool.

**Speaker D:** Hey, guys.

**Speaker A:** Nice to meet you, man.

**Speaker D:** Nice to meet you, Dasa. I really enjoy your talks on YouTube. They've been great.

**Speaker A:** I love you, dude.

**Speaker D:** I especially enjoyed the illustrations you showed, I think, Jonas, one time. They were good. It was the— oh yeah, and I think like the black and white one, but I don't remember what it was.

**Speaker A:** But it was— oh, thanks, I appreciate that, man. You should, uh, anybody listening, I have a Discord server, uh, Clear Light Zen. Feel free to join, and it's, um That's just another practice of the Dharma. It's just more another branch of the same tree. It's nothing special or different. And also, everybody listening, really fast, visit opensanghafoundation.org and start making friends on there. Dhammarato really— and Mike, you put a lot of work into that. A lot of people put a lot of work in that. I don't even know all the names of people, but Yeah, definitely check that out as well. But thanks, dude. We were just talking about getting rid of— not getting rid of— how do we manage when the body has fear in it? Fear of the unknown. Yeah. And is there— does that help you a little bit, Om Shanti Love?

**Speaker B:** Yes, it does. Sometimes it's often the case that you're deep into the challenge of whatever life is throwing at you, and then you'll be really calm. Everything, you know, you'll have really stressful times and you'll just be able to handle them pretty well. You're not, but it's the anticipation that something bad will happen that creates all that suffering. Of course, I've never found it in my life, at least, that when I'm in the thick of it, that I am really suffering. If anything, I'm just quite calm.

**Speaker A:** And let's practice. What happens when that fear arises? What should we do, guys? Go ahead.

**Speaker D:** You replace the Dukkha and turn it into Sukkha.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the holy alchemy. Yeah, Dhammarato has brought it into such a clean, perfect package, the practice. And he'll tell you, it's not my method or practice, it's the Buddha's. And that's great. But Dhammarato definitely has made it clear. He's taken away the rhetoric, he's taken away the mumbo jumbo. Him, Buddha Dasabikkhu, any other teachers Dhammarato may have had that helped him with this type of practice and method. It's a guide, you know. When we feel fear, let's say fear arises, just like you said, we remember to look. Oh, I notice— you can't change it unless you notice. I notice that this state I'm in is not sufficient because there's this desire, this negative attachment to control outcomes, you know. I can't control the future, therefore I'm afraid of it. So we just have to remember when those feelings come up, take a big deep breath and smile and say, everything's okay, everything's fine right here, right now, right in this present moment. This is the simple practice of gladdening the mind, of chilling out. It's nothing special or magical, but it is magical and special in the sense that it is available to everybody, and it is so simple and beautiful. There was— if I could tell you a quick story I thought of to help illustrate these things. There were two farmers. Let's say that they were rice farmers. And the two rice farmers, one of them was young and the other was old. And when they're out there planting the rice or doing whatever they do, a storm. The older farmer could feel in his bones that a storm was coming. He looked at the clouds, he saw the gray sky. He's been doing this long enough, he knows that a storm's coming. So he uses his wisdom to say, man, there's a storm coming, we better get inside. I've seen this before. And where does he go? He goes right inside his beautiful warm cabin. And the other arrogant young farmer says, man, we got work to do, we got money to make, we got mouths to feed, you know, I want to be viewed as a hard worker, I'm going to stay despite the storm, who cares, maybe the storm will come, maybe I'm going to stay. And the young stupid person stays there and the storm comes and he breaks his ankle trying to go run toward the house when it's too late. And that story just illustrates that storm that's coming is our negative attachments. And if we let it, if we don't have the wisdom to remember to look and change it by going back to the breath, going back to the present moment where everything's fine, going back to our home, that storm will come and consume you. And it consumes everybody who's arrogant and young a lot of the times. But the old farmer recognizes the signs. He feels the little dripples of precipitation on him. He's like, he looks at the sky, he reads the wind, he's like, I've seen this before, this is not good. Let's go home to our nice warm cabin, put our feet up by the fire, have a nice cup of coffee, relax. That's reality, you know. You don't have to be a slave to your negative attachments. Dumb people think that the reward is out there climbing the ladder of success, greedily trying to get every last drop of food before the storm comes. You have to let that stuff go. There's nothing there that's going to benefit you. Better to come home. It's always better to come home when you see a storm on the horizon, you know. And the breath is— it's such a good metaphor for the Anapanasati, because the cabin, it has the door and you have to open the door, and that's the breath. It's the doorway to what's happening right now in reality, and the reality is everything's fine. And our peaceful nature is revealed to us when we're just chilling with the breath. So we have to develop that Sati that the farmer had. We have to develop the skills with a little bit of practice, and it's fun. It's not work. It's fun. It's easy. And we get in the habit, the good habits of seeing, checking in with ourselves in a balanced way throughout our day. Is my mind at— and for people who are more letter and number oriented, I'm a very visual person. I know Dhammarato probably won't like me using the word I or me, or especially talking about how my mind's visual. I don't know, maybe I'll have to ask him, but but whatever. I'm a very visual person, and other people are very letter and number oriented. You know, they see things, they think in text almost. So I hear. And for those people, think of it more like your baseline is zero, and get really good at reading the scale. And once in a while, once in a while, check into your scale. Is it super high, happy, joy that you're getting attached to? Or is it super negative -10, fear, anxiety, anger, hatred, delusion. Or is it just peacefully at zero? So if it does get too happy, you say, yeah, I like this happiness, it's fine. But I have to keep in mind, I can't get attached to this stuff. It's not going to last forever. And that brings you back to zero. And then things— your mind switches to anger, hatred, fear, delusion, greed, lust, whatever. Doubt, that's a big one we were talking about the other day. And then you remember to look at your scale. Oh, is it -50? I mean, you know, this is not good. I got to bring it back to zero. Boom, you bring it back to zero. You change it. Say everything's okay, everything's fine. And the breath is the zero. The truth of reality is everything's fine here and now. This is the practice. This is why I emphasize this so much. And this will be the only thing I talk about is Anapanasati, the Noble Eightfold Path. Because it's the only thing that's worth talking about. Everything else is meaningless. Everything else is just pissing in the wind. Because what else can you do? I read— like I was talking to my friend on here the other day, we were talking about Milarepa. I've read the biographies of Milarepa. I've read the biographies of Yogananda and Osho and and read some of the Buddha, read the Pali Canon, I read all these things. But you ask yourself the question, well, what does this all mean? What can I do? So what? I read all this stuff. What good does it do? What we can do is the Noble Eightfold Path, which is why I emphasize its value. Not only is it valuable, it's the only thing worth of value. It's the only thing we can change to our benefit. True benefit, not just temporary sense pleasure bullshit. So is there anything else anybody has on their mind, Dharma-wise, or anybody just want to talk about something?

**Speaker E:** Hello, hello, hello.

**Speaker A:** Hi, Crash, how you doing, dude?

**Speaker E:** Wait, is my mic working?

**Speaker B:** Yes, it is.

**Speaker E:** Oh, oh, the blue wasn't showing up, so I didn't think it was putting audio. Sorry.

**Speaker A:** Oh, it's all good, dude.

**Speaker E:** Okay. Yeah, I thought that was really insightful. I've ever since that talk a couple of weeks ago, I've actually been sort of like digesting the everything is okay mentality. And I think I've been getting a lot out of it. It's like, at first, there's this resistance that's like, there's all these problems, right? These need to be fixed before this or that, and it can't be okay yet. But realistically, the idea that something isn't okay is an— like, it's an applied— it's an applied quality from the mind. It has nothing to do with the thing itself. The idea that something needs to be changed comes from the idea, not the thing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so we can just— it's as ridiculous as a tree telling itself, or a little small plant It's as ridiculous as the plant telling itself something needs to be done, something needs to be changed and controlled. It's like, plant, you're a plant. God gave you water and whatever the hell else you need. Just chill out.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, it just is. That doesn't mean that things can't be better, but they don't need to be better in order to find peace or comfort or whatever, right?

**Speaker A:** It doesn't mean you can't have fun. A lot of people, they get on this kick of like, you know, I can't do this if I'm practicing the Dharma. I can't, I can't, I can't. I've never experienced that. I've never felt because I practice the Dharma, therefore I can't. Like Dhammarato always says, all these things are just guidelines. You want to draw? Draw. As long as you're not hurting yourself or others, causing Dukkha for yourself and others, fucking go in the fucking field and dance around, fucking, you know, with a, with a hat on your head. I don't give a shit, you know. It's like, what does that have to do with anything, you know? It's like, do whatever thou will, you know. It doesn't matter as long as you're.

**Speaker D:** Not causing— Yeah, just the right amount of effort to find your middle way is the only thing to do ever, really.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, just the right amount of effort How much effort do we need? Just the right amount to change the Dukkha into Sukkha.

**Speaker C:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** And getting in the habits of bringing our scale back to a homeostasis, back to a balanced zero of the mind where it's his natural home. And the breath does that. Fear arises, we come back to the breath. Everything's okay, it's not that big of a deal. We don't have to worry so much about this stuff. That's the truth. And then eventually, even noticing the breath, even noticing this wholesome speech and inner thoughts, feelings, and emotions that are more wholesome, even that just becomes a second nature after a while. And you just are chill. Because what could possibly bother you? Oh, this person you love got sick? Okay, I don't want them to get sick, but I'll deal with it in this physical reality the best I can. I don't I know Dhammarato doesn't like the word try, but I love the word try in the physical sense. In the Dharma practice sense, he's right, you want to just do the practice. You don't want to try to do the practice, you just do it. You just come back to the breath and change it, because if you try to change it, it's not changing. But in the physical realm, I think trying is very important, because when a problem presents itself, what choice do you have but to try? You can't control things in that physical realm. You can control very little. But when it comes to the mind, it's like one of my favorite artists, Bukowski. I have Riders tattooed on my arm. On his gravestone it says, "Don't try." That's all it says, "Don't try." And what he meant by that was, don't try, do. Just do it, like Nike. He would hate that correlation. But that's what he really means. So when it comes to the practice, just do it. When it comes to the physical reality, problems occur. Just what can we do but try to solve them the best we can? Or don't solve them, you know, it's up to you. Whatever your choice is, the fact, the point of the matter is we have the ability to change our mind. We have the ability to not get caught in the weeds of our mind by remembering to look and change. And it's very easy. It's nothing special. You're just relaxing. We're just breathing. We're just having a good attitude. We're just, you know, don't worry, be happy with everything. Ah, stop worrying about getting it right. Oh, go ahead, buddy.

**Speaker D:** Um, one thing I think people get wrong a lot is like they they think they need something extra to like be okay, when in reality breathing is effortless, it's free and always available. And so when you get wrapped up in like needing something extra, a desire, you're always going to get it wrong. And it's until you try to actually detach from that, you'll then— you'll actually be satisfied, then you'll actually be happy, and you'll be able to sustain these things through Anapanasati.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well said. Definitely, man. Anybody else got any thoughts or opinions on what he just said?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I think it makes a lot of sense. I've sort of— there's been this idea that like I need to work through this issue or fix this thing and then things will be better, but there's not a need for things to be better. It's just like finding acceptance with how things are and just finding what you have and appreciating that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you need very little to be happy in this world, to be joyful in this world. And they whittled— the Buddhists, they whittled it down to the breath. And even that, if you don't have the breath, you're no longer here, and then you have no problems for sure, you know. Like Dhammarato always says, you know, it's a beautiful thing to breathe. Because if you're not, if you don't think it's a beautiful thing, try holding your breath. It sucks after a while. Everything in your cells wants to breathe. And when you have no breath and you finally breathe, it's like, man, I should appreciate the breath more because we take it for granted. We have a tendency to do that.

**Speaker E:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Kind of related, but I think one reason why cigarettes are so popular is because they actually force people to be in their breath. Not only is it the chemicals they're getting, they actually are having to take that moment of inhalation, deep chesting it, and then exhaling.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's probably why they're so popular. I don't smoke. Yeah, I don't smoke anymore. I smoked for like 16 years though. It's so heavenly. But well, yes, you're right, it's a fucked up form of Anapanasati. Yeah, there's a bunch of tar and.

**Speaker D:** A bunch of other chemicals that are fucking up your body whilst you're at it. Isn't oxygen better? Like, don't you think?

**Speaker A:** I don't know. Oxygen is definitely the best.

**Speaker D:** It's just enough for me.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah, a lot of monks smoke and there's a lot of people, they get all wrapped up in that drama. Should I, shouldn't I, should I? What's the rules? What's this? Man, if you're looking for your happiness to come straight from any material thing, you're never really going to be satisfied because it's never going to fully satisfy you. That's the nature of it. It's like the nature of a dog is to bark. The nature of, uh, having ignorance in this reality causes Dukkha.

**Speaker D:** When you want something, you're always going to want more of it. Like, when's my next hit? So it's going to be a cycle.

**Speaker A:** Definitely.

**Speaker B:** Of course, any smoker knows that if you wake up and you don't have a pack of cigarettes you're gonna go straight to the gas station. For the UK people, I don't know, does Tesco sell cigarettes?

**Speaker D:** They do, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Does it? That's good. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** And then you turn into, uh, I don't know, just like a badger. Get all mad. Where's my cigarette?

**Speaker D:** Treadmill cigarettes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, basically everywhere sells cigarettes here. It's kind of crazy. I'm also fucked up.

**Speaker A:** But yeah, yeah, alcohol is a big one too. A lot of people get sucked into that trap, man.

**Speaker D:** Live it down.

**Speaker A:** That is good. Yeah, addiction, you know, that's Mara's addiction.

**Speaker D:** Exactly. They don't have the, uh, wisdom to see past it because they're just so engulfed by it, I guess.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you know, it's a— in a weird way, it's a It's a very sad attempt of people who haven't heard the Buddhist teaching discussion trying to find Sukkha.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** It's a sad attempt of them— what's the old phrase? I want to get comfortably numb. You know, they don't know Buddha, they don't know the Dharma practice. All their society has given them is money, greed, and alcohol and drugs. So they're like, huh, why do we have this homeless problem? Why do we have this drug addict problem? I wonder why.

**Speaker D:** Why is the mental health so bad?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, why is the mental health— well, how was your childhood? Well, my parents, both parents worked all the time, and then I had a TikTok showing me, uh, yeah, drugs and other debauchery things. It's like, I wonder why our culture is so fucked. But in the truth of the matter is the culture, society, the world, everything's perfect because that shit's just illusion, phrases in my mind that don't exist. Come back to reality. Come back to right now. There is no society. There is no culture that's fucking up. There's just perfection, you know? But the more social media you watch, the more fear-based, fear-mongering news you watch— you know what's funny about the government? The government— there's a little secret about the government. It's not fucking powerful. It doesn't exist, but they get you talking about it. They get you saying, yeah, it's about as real as money.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, the constructs.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but what do they do? They get you talking about it, and they have no gripe if it's bad, a negative way you're talking about them, just as long as you have big daddy government in the back of your mind. Religion used to do the same thing. We don't care if you agree with us. We don't care if you like us or hate us. Just be talking about us. Have that fear in the back of your mind that we are an entity that's very powerful. And they exist and boom, like magic, they exist. Just like everything in our mind, you.

**Speaker D:** Know, I'm worried about— It's good.

**Speaker A:** Go ahead, buddy.

**Speaker D:** Any publicity is good publicity. Like, talking about it is the whole point.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's right. And in a way, we're doing almost a reverse propaganda campaign on our mind. We're taking away the bad Samsaras and Kammas, and we're saying— we're pumping it full of new propaganda that's actually— I don't know if it's even considered propaganda because it's just the truth. It's— everything is okay.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I think propaganda, the actual meaning of that word, is just like trying to convince people of something with some kind of like media or whatever. So it can definitely be true or beneficial things.

**Speaker A:** Sweet, then we pump our mind full of positive propaganda.

**Speaker D:** Yay, propaganda!

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's truthful propaganda about reality, because the truth is, like Dhammarato always says, there's no tigers attacking us right now, there's no mafia after us, it's just rooms It's just peaceful dudes chilling, trying to better themselves in a general way of speaking. You know, we're just— we just want to— we want to get to Nibbana, man. We just want to get to a place where our mind is taken off of the fire and we're just relaxing. And it is possible. The doubt disappears the more you do it. I've noticed that there's no— there's nothing to be doubtful of because you can see the truth plainly in plain sight when you remember to look at the truth. And the fruits of that truth are just the natural peace that is— I like to call in a kind of poetic way— it's our true nature, this peace. Perhaps even in a literal way. You know, everything else will go away and pass, but our true nature, this emptiness, this peace— a lot of people don't like to put labels on it, but I don't mind. Call it the Dhamma, you know. Bodhisattva Bhikkhuni used to say, if you want to get attached to something so bad, if you want a thing to be called a self so bad, if you need one, have it be the Dhamma. You know, and if you attach yourself to that, if you want, if you feel like attaching onto something for dear life, attach to the Dharma. You'll be happy as a clam, peaceful as a little Buddha statue. Anybody else? I'm sorry, go ahead.

**Speaker D:** People are too obsessed with the, like, aesthetics of the Buddha statue rather than, like, his actual, uh, teachings, or, you know, obviously the Dharma. Yeah, the Westerners, we've been, uh, we've.

**Speaker A:** Been trained to, uh, we've been trained by bullshit artists, you know, like, like, like when people are running for re-elections and stuff, like Barack Obama, perfect example. They don't care if you're a good person. They want you to dress and smell and look and act like a good person. Oh, then they become putty in your hands. You can do whatever you want. They don't give a shit, you know. The real evil— oh, sorry, go ahead, buddy.

**Speaker D:** I was just saying, I was just agreeing with what you're saying.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the real evil in common society, the thing that they think is really evil, is not fitting in with the herd. You know, and what is the herd like? The herd likes the way things look. The herd likes not the inside. The herd likes the outside, the physical, the status, the beauty, the bullshit clothing, the money, the houses, the cars. These are the things that ordinary type-minded people go after, and to their detriment, you know. But can't control them, and who would want to control them? The only thing we can control is remembering to look and change here and now. And it gets it. You got to get in the habit. You got to get to the momentum going, and it becomes a fun game, and it becomes easier over time. Then fear, doubt, all these things— nothing can be there because you're not clinging. You're not attached to anything negatively. You're just like, you're just chilling in a parking lot somewhere in your car or right here, whatever. And a thought comes, oh, I feel bored. That's okay. The mind offers me all types of suggestions. I don't have to listen to every damn suggestion it gives me. Oh, I feel angry. Okay. It's not me that feels angry. It's the body. See, I disassociate myself from that. That term has been used in a negative way, but yeah, disassociate from the body, disassociate from all these things. The I, me, my, mind. Because it's not us, you know. It's just a randomizer, a computer program. Actually, it's funny, I just heard a talk about from Buddhadasa Bhikkhu, and he actually said we should become more like computers because they just, they do their little activities and there's no quarrel within them. There's no clinging, there's no attachment. It's just you program it to do something, it does it. And he says that's a good way to practice the Dhamma. Remember, look and change. And then over time, that becomes so easy, it's not even a thing anymore. Then we Nibbana, then we chill out. That's all this is. It's nothing special, it's nothing magical or fairytale-like. It's just chilling, it's just breathing and relaxing. A lot of people get disappointed. They want to make it a religion, they want to make it a big show, they want to make it a fucking What the fuck is it called? They want to make it scholarly, you know, they want to make it this. No use, no use in doing any of them. A lot of times, you know, it's— I like to put things simply because that's when things get done. You know, I could say to my friend, hand me the cup of coffee, or I can say, oh, I noticed the sunlight glistening off this lovely mug. Would you be so kind as to raise your hand in the ether, and thereby springing it forth towards the cup? It's all bullshit. Just hand me the cup. Hand me the cup of coffee. The Buddha practice, what is it? Remember, look, and change. Relax. That's all it'll ever be. But people don't like that. They want the hard work. They are obsessed with the bullshit because that's what our bullshit society has brought us up in. So anyways, does anybody else have anything they want to talk about?

**Speaker D:** I'm sorry, one second. I'm sure you can hear.

**Speaker A:** One second. Yeah, it's okay. Thomas, were you saying something?

**Speaker C:** About bringing practice into doing things and finding the balance of When to take a break? Is it to take a break as soon as doing something while practicing becomes unsatisfying and maybe in a minute or two it doesn't change? Is it then time to take a break or lay down, sit down and practice that way and then go back again? Any thoughts about that?

**Speaker A:** Does anybody else want to respond to what Thomas was saying about, are taking breaks necessary or relevant?

**Speaker B:** I think, shouldn't it be fun? It should be fun, right? It should be joyful to practice. And if And if it's uncomfortable, it must be in some type of way that there is some attachment in the sense of, oh, I'm practicing and I'm not doing so well, I should be doing better, or I'm not meditating all the time as well as I could be. And I think all of those are Attachments, are they not?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, shoulds and shouldn'ts are definitely attached. I should be getting this out of it. I should be more joyful. It should be this way. It should be that way. But to answer your question simply, you want to take a break, take breaks. Yeah, if it's causing you dissatisfaction, yeah, chill out for a while. Oh, I think that dude had to go. Peace out, homie.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, and I also meant Practicing, not just practicing by itself, but practicing, for example, while cooking, while doing the dishes, any kind of other activities. And then as soon as it kind of feels like too big of a piece of cake to handle, being satisfied, taking a break, going to seclusion from all the doing and just being still and practicing that way, going back to satisfaction. Going back to the easier way to go back to satisfaction.

**Speaker A:** Ironically, taking a break from practice is practice. Relaxing from getting attached to all this bullshit is the practice. To feel good. You know? People say like, okay, I've been practicing, which to them means I've been— let's say I'm cooking. I've been cooking, but I've also been very vigilant. And I'm not letting a single dukkha thought come. I'm going to battle this dukkha thought. Now this, I'm really practicing now. And they go, fuck, this is kind of tiring. I'm going to go sit down and relax and take a break from practice. That is practicing, taking a break, breathing. Everything's okay. Whatever you're doing, if you're cooking, if you're working, whatever you're doing, then that is the practice. So I almost laugh when people say that I'm going to take a break, I'm doing too much. It's like in a weird way, you're not doing enough. Because you should— whatever activity you're doing, you should be relaxing within that activity. But for beginners, we say, you know, do it balanced way, 6, 7 times a day, because that's easier for them to conceptualize. They want to sit and meditate, they want to sit and be alone, and that's sometimes what beginners need. But as you become more seasoned, you realize that the meditation is— the Sati is what it is. It's not really meditation. The Sati is the lifestyle choice of feeling good, gladdening the mind here and now with whatever you're doing. So you become an expert really fast when you're doing it all the time because it's not a strenuous thing. It's just what else are you going to do besides feel good? And sure, the brain may have some things that don't feel good, but then you get— you just say, that's the body, that's not me. And that's a very natural and okay thing for the brain to experience. And ironically, that's the way you feel good again, even within this bullshit in your mind. So whatever comes, just go back to your house, go back into your home through the doorway of the breath. And the storm is negative attachments. And the negative attachments come in many shapes and forms and disguises, but usually you know them by their fruits, and their fruits are they cause Dukkha. So even if you're saying, "I'm going to a Buddhist temple 100% of the day, I'm meditating 50%, I'm doing everything good," are you satisfied? Fuck no, I'm tired and exhausted and stressed. Then stop doing all that shit or change what's happening. Remember to look and change. That's the opposite of practicing the Dharma, is to obsess over getting a result instead of just letting go of getting a result. Letting go. Who cares if you're enlightened? Who cares if you get it right? Who cares if you're the best Dharma practitioner? Who gives a fuck? Then you become the best when you let go of all that shit, when you let go of getting it right. Don't worry about getting it right. There's nobody— to get it right is to get it wrong. To get it right is to let go of expectations. Be okay with whatever is. It's easy. Yeah, but it's not easy when you feel anger. Who feels anger? Well, I feel anger. No, your body just suggested you feel angry because of an activity that happened that didn't go according to your plan, and you followed that suggestion down the path of Dukkha, and now you're trapped in the weeds. But when it throws me that suggestion, I go, oh, there's anger there. Okay, so what? Why am I angry? Oh, because my kid broke this. So let it be broken. I wouldn't want it to be broken, but it got broken, and that's fine. Fuck it. I'm not going to get angry. And I'm not anger. My body has anger. It's a difference, you know. Yeah, anyways, dudes, I gotta get going soon. Any, any last, uh, any last things you guys want to talk about before I go?

**Speaker E:** Well, just thank you first. Just very nice to have stuff like this every now and then.

### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by **Speaker A (likely Dhammarato or a close student)**, centers on the core practice of transforming dissatisfaction (Dukkha) into well-being (Sukkha) through mindful awareness, using the breath (Anapanasati) as the primary tool. Here is a summary of the key themes and teachings discussed:

### **Core Teaching: "Remember to Look and Change"**
The practice is presented as a simple, moment-to-moment adjustment:
1.  **Notice (Look):** Become aware of your mental state. Is there fear, anxiety, anger, or clinging? Or is there calm, joy, or peace?
2.  **Adjust (Change):** Consciously shift from a state of Dukkha to Sukkha. The primary method is returning to the breath and the present moment, affirming "everything is okay right here, right now."

### **Main Themes Discussed**

1.  **Fear of Uncertainty & the "Storm" of Attachment:**
    *   Fear arises from the desire to control future outcomes. Society and media often amplify this fear.
    *   The solution is to accept the reality of aging, sickness, and death, and to find peace in the present, where fear does not exist.
    *   A parable is shared: A wise farmer sees a storm (negative attachments) coming and returns to the safety of his cabin (the present moment/breath). The arrogant farmer stays out and suffers. The "door" to the cabin is the breath.

2.  **Calm Awareness vs. Mere Calmness:**
    *   It’s not enough to just be calm. One must be **awarely calm**—mindful of the calm state itself, its impermanence, and able to let it go without dissatisfaction when it ends.

3.  **The "Scale" or "Baseline" of the Mind:**
    *   The mind's natural, peaceful home is a balanced "zero."
    *   Practice involves checking in and gently bringing the mind back from extremes of negative emotion (-10) or excessive, clinging joy (+10) back to the peaceful, balanced center (0) via the breath.

4.  **Simplicity and Anti-Dogmatism:**
    *   The practice is stripped of ritual, scholarly complexity, and religious dogma. It is repeatedly called "simple," "easy," and "nothing special."
    *   The **Noble Eightfold Path** is emphasized as the only thing of true value—the practical method to end suffering.
    *   The group cautions against getting caught in aesthetics (e.g., Buddha statues), rules, or the "shoulds and shouldn'ts" that turn practice into a burdensome task.

5.  **Integration into Daily Life:**
    *   Practice is not just sitting meditation. It is a **lifestyle choice** of "gladdening the mind" during all activities—cooking, working, etc.
    *   If an activity becomes stressful, "taking a break" to relax *is itself the practice* of returning to peace.
    *   The goal is for mindful awareness to become effortless and second nature.

6.  **Non-Identification with Thoughts/Feelings:**
    *   A key strategy is to dis-identify from mental phenomena: "It's not *me* that feels angry; the *body* has a suggestion of anger." This creates space to choose not to follow the thought down a path of suffering.

7.  **Addressing Addiction and Societal Ills:**
    *   Addictions (smoking, alcohol) are seen as misguided attempts by those unaware of the Dhamma to find happiness and numb suffering.
    *   Broader societal problems (mental health crises, fear-based culture) are rooted in ignorance of this core practice of inner peace.

### **Key Takeaways for Practitioners**
*   **The Tool:** Use the breath as the anchor to the present.
*   **The Mantra:** "Everything is okay right here, right now."
*   **The Habit:** Frequently "remember to look and change" your mental state back to a peaceful baseline.
*   **The Attitude:** Let go of striving for results, achieving "enlightenment," or doing it "right." Peace is found in letting go of expectations.
*   **The Scope:** This practice is applicable at all times, transforming every moment into part of the path.

The talk concludes with an emphasis on community, directing listeners to the Open Sangha Foundation website and a Discord server for ongoing support. The overall tone is informal, pragmatic, and encouraging, focusing on immediate, accessible relief from suffering.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (primarily Speaker A) uses several key metaphors and one extended story to illustrate the Dhamma practice.

### **Metaphors:**

1.  **The Bag/Burden of Bricks:** Fear, paranoia, and negative habits are compared to a heavy "bag of bricks" or "case of bricks" that people carry on their backs, often without even noticing it. The practice involves "set[ting] it down."

2.  **The Scale/Baseline:** The mind's state is compared to a numerical scale. The peaceful, ideal state is "zero" or "baseline." Positive states (joy, happiness) go above zero, and negative states (fear, anger, doubt) go below zero (e.g., "-10," "-50"). The practice is to "check into your scale" and bring it back to zero.

3.  **The Home/Cabin:** The state of peaceful awareness is compared to a "beautiful warm cabin" or simply "home." It's a place of safety and comfort to return to.

4.  **The Doorway (of the Breath):** The breath is explicitly called "the doorway" to the present moment and to reality ("the cabin... has the door and you have to open the door, and that's the breath").

5.  **Holy Alchemy:** The core practice of transforming dissatisfaction (*Dukkha*) into satisfaction (*Sukkha*) is called "the holy alchemy."

6.  **The Fire:** *Nibbana* (the ultimate goal) is described as a state where "our mind is taken off of the fire," implying a release from the "burning" of suffering.

7.  **The Weeds:** Getting lost in negative thoughts and emotions is described as being "trapped in the weeds."

8.  **The Herd:** Ordinary society, which values external appearances and materialism, is referred to as "the herd." Not fitting in with these superficial values is seen positively.

9.  **The Computer:** An ideal, unattached mind is compared to a computer that performs tasks without internal quarrel or clinging, simply following its programming (in this case, the "program" of remembering to look and change).

10. **Pissing in the Wind:** Activities other than the core Noble Eightfold Path practice are dismissed as meaningless, like "pissing in the wind."

### **Story:**

**The Two Farmers and the Storm:**
This is an extended parable used to illustrate the core teaching.
*   **Characters:** An **old, wise farmer** and a **young, arrogant farmer**.
*   **The Storm:** Represents **negative attachments** and the suffering they bring.
*   **The Plot:** The old farmer sees the storm (negative patterns) coming based on his experience and wisdom. He proactively goes inside his warm cabin (returns to peaceful awareness via the breath) to safety. The young farmer ignores the signs, stays out to work (clings to greed, status, control), and is caught in the storm, getting hurt (suffering).
*   **The Moral:** Wisdom involves recognizing the early signs of negative mental states (fear, attachment) and using the practice (the breath as the doorway) to return "home" to peace before you are overwhelmed and suffer.

### **Summary of Core Analogies:**
The talk constructs a coherent metaphorical framework:
*   **The Problem:** Carrying a **bag of bricks** (fear, habits), being stuck in **the weeds** of thought, or staying outside in a **storm** of negative attachment.
*   **The Solution:** Use **the breath as a doorway** to go **home** to your **warm cabin** (peaceful awareness).
*   **The Method:** Check your mental **scale** and use the **holy alchemy** to bring it back to **zero**. Become like a **computer**, efficiently running the program of "look and change" without internal drama.
*   **The Goal:** To be taken off **the fire** of suffering and stop chasing the illusions valued by **the herd**.
