### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Is A, we stop investigating. Yes, we fall out of right view automatically because we've collapsed the investigation. We said, oh, this person's beyond reproach, this person we don't— and we can trust someone and still it's like the CIA, in God we trust, in all else we investigate, right? In all else we look into it, and we know we don't need to worry about God, so all we need to do is keep investigating. So when I hear this, I see this as part of the problem. Would you say that I'm on the right track with what you're talking about?

**Speaker B:** Yes. Okay. That one of the things that happened very early when I was actually in psychotherapy and psychology and all, I, like so many of the other students that I knew, we were all into commiserating about how hard it is to go into business that everybody, you know, that even though they've got a PhD in psychology, the easy way out is to go work for the government.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And a great deal of it had to do with insurance, that in Michigan at the time they had Michigan Blue Cross Blue Shield. And that the insurance companies would not pay for anything that was mental health. Interesting. In fact, they wanted medical procedures, right? They wanted proof that what they were paying for had some value.

**Speaker A:** This is where we get the DSM.

**Speaker B:** That's exactly right. That's why the diagnostic codes were invented for psychotherapy as an let us say, an answer to the insurance companies not wanting to pay for it. Wow. And that the diagnostic codes got more and more complicated, more and more sophisticated, trying to, you know, go down that rat hole of convincing the insurance companies that they were legitimate as far as health is mental health.

**Speaker A:** So can I ask your opinion on this real quick? Because when I hear you talk about that, one of the things that comes to my mind is what I've heard referred to as, within the setting of like a meditation instructor and a person learning instruction, is called scripting. So if I tell you that you're going to have a bad time before things better, it's highly likely you're going to have a bad time before things get better. When I hear about this big book of diagnostic codes, and I think about the relationship and its intention of being therapeutic, which in my eyes now consists almost entirely of being able to engender non-discrimination.

**Speaker B:** Okay, does that make sense?

**Speaker A:** Like, for me to have a therapeutic outcome from psychotherapy, I need to be able to hold my experience without cutting it.

**Speaker B:** And.

**Speaker A:** I shouldn't say I need, because I'm sure there are other possible therapeutic outcomes, but I envision, you know, the outcome that I would desire would be to be able to hold whatever experience without wanting to cut it. Without wanting to push some of it away and pull some of it closer. So, when I have someone that I recognize the image or the sign of authority within because it's vested upon them through the AMA, right? And they have this book and they can say all day, "I don't care, this is just for insurance." But, when this is part of the script of the parent— I mean, of the patient. Funny that I said parent. Of the patient, patient-provider interaction, I don't understand how it could possibly not influence the treatment.

**Speaker B:** Does that make sense? Well, it does influence it, but not quite in the way that you would think. And then, in fact, most of the time it backfires. And here's what I mean by that, is that those diagnostic codes are not for the client. Those diagnostic codes are for the therapist and the psychiatrist, just like they are for the medical doctor. Okay, that the diagnostic codes often have fancy words, just like the body and the bones and all have very fancy words— femurs and all of that kind of language that nobody speaks.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** All right, so if you tell the kid you've got a broken arm, that's all he needs to hear. He doesn't need to know the technical definition of which bone that was broken. He's going to have to wear a cast, right?

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** All right, so let's get back then to the diagnostic codes. Are often, and in fact in almost every case that I have seen, the diagnostic codes that a person has about themselves that they were told by a psychologist actually is detrimental.

**Speaker A:** Yes, right, that's what I was— yeah.

**Speaker B:** It'S detrimental in the way that, um, oh, this is who I am, right?

**Speaker A:** Because they tack that on, they pick it up, they hold that, and they.

**Speaker B:** Certainly don't— in general, not true, right? Right. Uh, uh, ADHD, attention deficit disorder, Any mind that is not trained, yes, has an attention deficit disorder. Every kid has that.

**Speaker A:** When I realized that, I laughed so hard because that was something that came up when in the course of talking about PTSD and ADHD and all of these, so many words and terms and such. And I remember at the time thinking, okay, this makes sense, I suppose. I look around and I see others and they do something different, and someone is telling me 'Oh, it's because of this.' And when I actually learned from you how to train the mind, I was amazed at just how quickly we buy those labels to cover up because we have ignorance. We don't know.

**Speaker B:** Right. And then the label becomes an excuse.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly. And it even becomes an excuse to not take the medicine, the real medicine, the actual learning how to see the.

**Speaker B:** Mind medicine because they're relying upon the pills, which is not medicine. It's a business transaction. Yeah, that often the medications that people are given don't do what they're prescribed for. No, then they have side effects. And so people wind up taking 5, 10, 20 different pills. Half of them are there interfering with the other pills that didn't work in the first place.

**Speaker A:** Right. It's so wild. It's exactly like what the Buddha describes with a thicket of views, but we just removed the experiential portion somehow and just delved even deeper into the thicket of chemically reinforced views.

**Speaker B:** Okay, and then that perpetuates that relationship. Yeah, the therapist and the client. Now, when I was in psychotherapy and figuring that out, you knew, or you probably had known by then, by the time that I got into the PhD program in psychotherapy after having some courses and some training and that kind of stuff, and getting up there with them, I had a fallback.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** In the sense that I already had a master's in electrical engineering. Right.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And I recognized that it would— I might eventually, as a psychologist or a psychotherapist, be able to make more money than I could as an electrical engineer. But I can go make a high salary as an electrical engineer right now. Right. And so that's when I kind of made the decision that, uh, yeah, I'll finish the program, I'll finish the degree, but I'm not ever going to bother getting a license.

**Speaker A:** Oh, interesting.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because those licensing— I mean, that's like getting a lawyer's license. You got to stand before the bar and all that kind of stuff. It's very, very, um, copycat like that. Yes. So this is when I ran across Muktananda. This was in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which in those days was very, very progressive, right?

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And so, um, Muktananda had an ashram there, and, uh, I started to go. I hung out there. I parked my van in front of the place, and sometimes in really cold nights would come in But then Muktananda himself shows up, and all of this guru worship, all this Indian stuff was there. And I kind of, with a background of psychology, started studying the situation from that perspective rather than the raw guru Sila kind of thing. And I did have a lot of respect for him. In fact, I had even more respect for him once I got to India, to his ashram in Ganeshwari. But I could also see that he was just an ordinary human being that had gotten placed in the status of a guru, okay, that they were worshiping him for no good reason. This was actually my first great disappointment in India. And so I began to go around looking for all of the great gurus.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** I spent quite a lot of time, about 5 or 6 months, at, uh, uh, at the Rajneesh, or Osho, place, and became again quite disappointed. Yeah, he was a good teacher in the sense of a good talker, but he was dirty. Oh, you raped female women. And, uh, had a fetish for royals' voices and all kinds of stuff. Yeah, and not only that, but I did some of the, uh, the courses and things, and I had a, uh, a session with one of the guys who was a hypnotist there. And, uh, I had had hypnotist training in Detroit And I was completely disappointed with this guy in the sense that he didn't know what he was talking about. He didn't know what he was doing. He was just there trying to make a buck to stay in, uh, Pune or Poona. Gotcha, gotcha.

**Speaker A:** That's pretty funny.

**Speaker B:** So I guess I was, you know, too educated and too wise and too smart and too much of an investigator to actually put up with all of that Hindu stuff. So I went down to Bangalore, and on the train to Bangalore, I met an Indian woman who spoke fairly good English, and she invited me to her home having a meal. And while we— while I was there with her, she drug out an old, old newspaper that showed an exposé that was page after page of hidden camera shots showing that, uh, Satchidananda Sai Baba in Bangalore was a fraud.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I remember you telling me this story. I like this one.

**Speaker B:** All right, and so, uh, that's, that's when I eventually got into Buddhism, was having, uh, all of these experiences of all of these frauds in the Hindu tradition. Okay. And now I see that the same thing is basically happening in Buddhism in the West, to where the monks that I met in Thailand were much more legitimate in the sense that they really— I mean, Ajahn Po really cared about me. Yes, he really, really cared about me. And that was the thing that was so amazing to me, that gave me so much let us say, confidence. But that's the difference, is that I would say that it's something like closer to family rather than a teacher, that a teacher expects the student to always be a teacher, unless the teacher is— excuse me, the teacher is always going to be the teacher and the student is always going to be the student.— to where that doesn't— that generally, if we're lucky, that doesn't happen. Eventually, the roles are reversed, and the student becomes the teacher of his old teacher. For instance, the guy who teaches algebra in high school, he has a few kids that are really, really interested in math, and he's a really good teacher for them. Then they go to the university, really get some math, and now they know a whole lot more math than their high school math teacher.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** And so this is where the whole teaching of the Buddha comes in, is that we do not want the student to remain a student. No.

**Speaker A:** And this is really what the Mahayana tradition is trying to say as well when I hear them talk about it, when I hear them talk about Buddha nature. They're not talking about turning into a superhero. They're saying that it's your job to continue to spread the light once you figure out how to look with it.

**Speaker B:** And so this is where that idea of the teacher training comes in.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Is that normally teacher training, in fact, is almost a requirement that if you do teacher training on the internet then that relationship is never going to change, right? The original teacher who sets up those courses is going to be seen and highly regarded as a great big teacher, and those students pay high dollars for the course, and yet they're not really trained as teachers, right? They just listen to what the other teacher said about teaching, but they never get thrown into it. That was what Bhikkhu Buddhadasa did with me long before— well, at least months before I became a monk. He already had me teaching. Uh-huh.

**Speaker A:** Out at Wat Suwan Mokkh?

**Speaker B:** At Wat Suwan Mokkh. Just like the Buddha put that duty onto Ananda, he put that duty onto Sariputta, Mahamagala, and all of the other monks was, is that now it's time for you to teach the Dharma. There's also a sutta that says that there are 5 ways to learn the Dharma, and the most important one is to become a teacher of the Dharma. Okay, that first you listen to the teacher, then you learn the chanting, you mull that over, you talk with the other students and that kind of stuff, But then the way that you really learn the Dharma is by teaching it.

**Speaker A:** Got it.

**Speaker B:** Because why? Because you're not just out on your own running your mouth the way that we would have it in the West, but rather that you're there being trained as a teacher by teaching in front of your elders.

**Speaker A:** In front of teaching? Yeah, in front of teachers, right?

**Speaker B:** It doesn't Bhikkhu Buddhada, I remember that so well. I remember it was in the spiritual theater. I remember the crowd, and I remember that he and I were sitting there, me on a lower place, all dressed in white, and I was going to help him. He asked me to help him with the talk. That's what I was set up for. Now the talk he's going to give is on the Four Noble Truths. And he starts it off, and I explain what he just said and turn back to him, and he says, you take it from here. And there I was with Achan Po, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, and all of these monks and Thai people, and, and a whole bunch of Westerners were there, and he put me on the spot. In later times, Achan Po would put me on the spot like that, but I was ready for it. I mean, that first time was enough.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so when Ajahn Po asked me to give a talk on the Seven Factors of Enlightenment at a retreat that I was visiting, I was ready to go. And in fact, to be honest with you, he said that in the evening for the talk that was going to be done at 7:30 in the morning, and I just happened to have had the Mahayana with me. And that was the night that I basically memorized the Anapanasati Sutta, so that I could give that talk on the relationship of the practice and the culmination of the practice is then the enlightened factors grow. So this is the whole style of the teacher training, is that it has to be done in a way where the teachers are actually trained. Now I can go back to my childhood when I was living in South Carolina. There was a school called Winthrop Training College.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And that this was what— I don't know how many schools like that were around or how many were in South Carolina, how many states have these kind of schools, but I do know that it didn't last long. If something happened in the sense that a teacher doesn't get teacher training so much as they get a lot of classroom and a lot of psychology. But at Winthrop Training School, the students did all of the teaching, like for the first grade, but they had first grade teachers in the classroom with them. And so the students would do the teaching, but the old masters were standing right there, right? And that meant that you have to be on your toes. You can't respond to the kids the way you want to in your heart. You've got to respond to them correctly because the teacher is standing right there, right? So this is, this is the kind of thing that we need to do in a teacher training program. And obviously the easy way to do it— I mean, the Open Sangha Foundation is not going to actually do that kind of thing. But what we can do is set this up so that if people want to become, let us say, dedicate their lives to the Dharma, whether they're going to be a layman or a monk or a nun, uh, but almost always what you hear is, is that, oh, I want to be a teacher, I want to be a Dharma teacher, right? And then with that, it goes back to the old Western idea of, well, you gotta You got to eat, so you got to work to eat. And so they begin to mix those two together, charging these high prices for the Dharma and even higher prices to do a teacher training program to where the teachers are not trained in that program. Right. The right way to do it is to help these students who are coming to Open Sangha Foundation with that kind of point of view and help them get into a wat where they will have an abbot that's been a monk for 20 years who is really going to be doing the training. That is in fact what's happened to Cat here on the island. He's at Wat Ruesipas Yangtong, and that the abbot there is marvelous. Well, I kind of figured he would be marvelous anyway, but he's marvelous in the sense that Cat can see that this guy has something. One of the things that Kat has said was, is that Ajahn Maitri doesn't have any problems of his own, so he's there to help the people who come to the wat with their problems. And that I assume that if Kat stays there for a few months, he's going to be put into the teacher's position. Yeah. Arya is going to say, you take it from here, Cat. And Cat's going to say, the first time it happens, but then he'll make it through, right? And that this is the way that teachers are trained. And I can see that in the West, that because of the language problem, that the Thai monks who come to the West are there for the Thai people and they don't care whether the monk learns English or not, right? It is not that big a deal because they come to teach to the wat for the Thai language anyway, right? So I would imagine that if you had, let us say, just some wat as an example, the abbot of that wat would be very kindly looking towards a Westerner who would come hang out maybe move in, and pretty soon we're going to set up a meditation class once a week so that the Westerner can start teaching the Dhamma to the community.

**Speaker A:** Very nice.

**Speaker B:** And then maybe after a few months, we'll do a weekend retreat or two, right? And so this is the way that we would get it started as sort of a grassroots level. But the point is, is that you can't take a teacher's training program and then start teaching the Dharma if the training program is not set up correctly. And paying money for it means that the teacher cannot teach generosity because he's charging you money for what he's given you. This is a business deal, right? In order to teach generosity, you have to be generous to people. Yes, that's how we teach generosity, is by being generous. And so this moving into the what, the— like the example with Cat here on the island, is that he is extraordinarily in a state of gratitude for the generosity that he's getting from the abbot. That Pedro was thinking about doing this. And one of the things that Kat said to Pedro is, is that once you move into a wat, you don't need money because the Thai people are going to take care of your bodily needs, and you've got housing, and you've got a master teacher there. Now, most— one of the things that's really amazing is, is that in order to be an abbot of a wat Anagami, the monk has to have been a monk for 20 years. Okay, that means that he was in training as a teacher for 20 years. Yep. That in fact, the label of Achan doesn't come until one's been a monk for 10 years, and the word Achan then means that he's ready to start teaching. Why? Because he's been thrown into the teaching over and over again, though many monks, they don't do that. I've seen, well, mostly Westerners who have been too shy to allow themselves to be put into the teacher's position. Interesting. And in fact, I've seen one guy like that, that he would avoid Ajahn Po at all costs because he knew that if he hung around Ajahn Po, Aishanpo is going to put him to work. So, uh, any teacher program that we're talking about setting up with OSF is not going to be the school itself. It's much more like going to be the HR department of a university. Okay, to get people connected together, that that's what the whole point about the Open Sangha Foundation is, is to communicate so that people can find teachers, students can find other students to make friends with, that the students can find wats to go to. This is why Kat and Pedro both are doing so much work of getting the names of wats. We've gotten more than about 300. Yeah. So that, uh, people can get in touch with these places, go visit them. That's one of the reasons to have the Google Maps, is so you can say, oh, well, there's a wat only about a 20-minute drive from here. That's, uh, and so, uh, getting people involved with real Dharma people rather than the Westerners who are making it a business. That's the danger of Western Buddhism, is it's fallen into a business model, which means it is just another kind of psychotherapy. Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** Samsara light, right?

**Speaker B:** Exactly. So.

**Speaker A:** Like, just let me stay a slave but make it comfortable. Which is sad, but it's also fun.

**Speaker B:** But an example then would be the difference between a mommy and a daddy is that the mommy wants the child to be a child and to be her son or her daughter for their whole lives, where dad is saying things more like, grow up and be a man.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker B:** All right, so this is the kind of relationship that we need. We don't want to keep a client a client. We want them to come up to the level of the teacher himself. And this is where the word Kaliyametta or Kaliyamitta comes in, that we become spiritual friends. I don't have Ajahn Po up on a pedestal anymore. I know his foibles. I know Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's foibles. He's a human being. He just happens to be an extraordinary, happily human being. And they can manage things just quite well. Yeah, within the guru, the guru has to hide all of his faults because he doesn't want to disappoint all of the, uh, wannabes.

**Speaker A:** But we already know from the Anapanasati Sutta that this is not— like you said, it's not When Anapanasati is practiced fully and continuously, as in we don't stop it, we see, you know what I mean, clearly there's no end to a painful feeling arising. Painful feelings still arise even in the Arhat. They simply know that their next step is to breathe in and out, calming the painful feeling. Rather than acting out like a monster man.

**Speaker B:** Precisely so. And not only that, but that whole idea of friendship means that it's a continuing, ongoing kind of thing. But one of the things that you can see within the model of the psychotherapy, and I see this in with Buddhism in the West also, is that we come We pay, we expect to get results, right? And then the business deal is over.

**Speaker A:** Yep.

**Speaker B:** This is exactly what happens with retreats in the sense that there is no relationship much with the teacher, not a real relationship. I mean, a howdy-do and maybe an hour or so before they have the retreat. And then they have only a few minutes a day with the teacher. If they're lucky, they get 15 minutes. Normally they get 15 minutes with another student, right? And then they pay for the course, and then when the course is over, they leave. Yeah, the 10-day retreat is over, the business deal is finished, there's nothing left to it.

**Speaker A:** Any enduring relationship is the relationship of a repeat customer.

**Speaker B:** Yes, exactly. That businesses know that, that Kleenex wouldn't sell a lot of Kleenexes if they only sold one box of Kleenex to the, to the, um, to the customer. No, they want him to buy a box of Kleenex every week. So this is the whole idea of that repetitive business or that repetitive practice. We leave the world, we go to the wat so that we can spend the time that it takes to practice, right, over and over and over and over again. Why? Because we've got two major problems. One is that we're fighting with both the DNA that we were born with, the instinct, which is a self-preservation instinct basically, And so in our society, almost everything that happens becomes a survival issue, right? I remember a 7th grade spelling test became a survival issue for me. Having bullies walk down the hall is a survival issue. Yeah, that's right, because of our DNA. But the worst part of it is, is that the society then everybody in the society is in that survival mode, right? And so that's propagated in the form of education, which goes with the instincts. And so we live a life of instinct, and that the education that we get is from other people who live instinctively.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** And so here's all of that deep training for our whole lives being trained by instinctive people, and also we've got our own instincts. And so to come out of that requires practice.

**Speaker A:** A lot.

**Speaker B:** Well, not a lot, but right now it does.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Okay. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Practice right now. The point, I guess, that you're making is that there's a lot of right nows.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Right. They continue to come one by one.

**Speaker B:** One by one.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** About the time that a clock ticks, there's a new now, right? Yeah. And so that's the time to practice again, is right now, to come out of our instincts, to come out of our survival mode, to come out of our territorial mode, to come out of our going along to getting along mode coming from the herding instinct. You got to be part of the herd to survive. No, you don't. No. And yet we're trained that way. And the way that we're trained in our society is, oh, you got to eat, so you got to work. You got to work to eat. Yeah. And yet I know millions of people on the planet Earth, literally millions of people who do not work. And they eat. A good example of that would be Donald Trump. He doesn't work, he frets. Yep. Okay, that wealthy people, they don't work but they eat. Um, politicians, they don't work but they eat.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's really hard. You see this, you see this idea mirrored all over the place in society that— and it's this idea of— I have a feeling it comes from Protestantism. It has to do with delayed gratification and the idea that we're not there yet and the idea that it's Anapanasati, but it's wrong. Does that make sense? It's from the wrong perspective. It's like the idea that, uh, what do we call it? There's words for it in the Western language. Um, when you see Donald Trump and he has money, the fact that he has money, uh, confers upon him the idea that he deserves to have that money. It's a very circular logic. Does that make sense?

**Speaker B:** Like, a lot of people look at— oh yes.

**Speaker A:** And they think because they're rich, they deserve their riches.

**Speaker B:** Right, one of the words that is there is nepotism.

**Speaker A:** Yes, right, things like this.

**Speaker B:** Yes, my dad was a carpenter. You got to be a— I got to be a carpenter. Well, in my case, my dad was a pipe fitter, uh-huh, as one thing, and meter reader, and, uh, also a furnace installer. Well, yeah, because he was a furnace installer, that's where I got my first transformer. And off I go into electrical because he was very much involved with the electrical stuff. Wiring houses for thermostats and all of that kind of stuff. So we do basically live in a nepotitic world, right? And that politics is one of those, and big money is another one. Teachers, how about cops? Yeah, yeah, cops have families of cops. My grandfather was a cop, kind of thing, you know, that's so We do what we know, which means we do what we're trained to do. And what we're trained to do is by people who were ignorantly trained also, going way back into the past.

**Speaker A:** Way back. Yes, right.

**Speaker B:** And it makes way, way back. And so one of the things then we can say that we can do is to come out of that instinctively herding, that we do what we're told to do in order to stay in the herd, right? And this is one of the reasons why Westerners have so much trouble with their families to go off to Thailand to become a monk, where in Thailand the kids are pushed into it, right?

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** And it's from the same perspective. And that is, oh, don't go do something that we don't know how to do. You got to go do something we know all about, right? That the parents are uncomfortable when a student, when their child takes on something that they don't understand, correct? So that, that's part of that herding instinct, which means now that that instinct that we're born with and raised with, that raising then makes it even more pressurized, right? And so this is why we have to remember the practice right now, because those instincts and those old memories of all that we've been trained keep coming right back up to the surface over and over again. So we have to be— we have to remember to be here now. We have to remember that this present moment is all that we really have, and that we can then, when we get fairly good at that, we can start communicating that to other people, to our friends. This is where the teacher role comes in, but a teacher role is not going to be a teacher role for long. What we're really teaching is friendship, right? And so the teacher is not necessarily such a teacher. He's a friend, right? And yet in our system, it's always been separated. The example that I'd use here now is in military situations, it's always the aristocracy who put on the armor because they can afford it. They become the centurions, they become the officers.

**Speaker A:** Yep. Officer over here.

**Speaker B:** The overseers, the officers of the troops. And the troops, the one who have the grunts, are the ones who have to do all the work.

**Speaker A:** Yep, yep.

**Speaker B:** An example of that then would be that the ship's captain, he doesn't work. No, he's got the— I mean, he's got the boilermakers, he's got the gunners, he's got the, um, uh, the deckhands and all of that. And they're the ones who do the work. Of the ship, right? But the admiral, he's got nothing to do except stand around making sure that everybody else is working. So this two-tiered system of officers and enlisted— in fact, they don't enlist often, they're drafted, right? But if they— well, if they— that.

**Speaker A:** Two-Tiered system, you just run right to them. They got me good this time around that way. Yes, I know. I look back at my family like you were talking about with nepotism, and I see on my mother and my father's side, back 4 or 5 generations, as far back as I figured to look— and I didn't even bother, my wife did the whole genealogy thing a while back and started telling me about it— but when she did, she's, oh, look at that, how familiar. All of them, all the way back, either Army or Marine Corps. And okay, so You know, it's very plain for me to see that they just load you up right out of the gate and shoot you with a cannon, you know, or shoot you out of a cannon. They don't even know they're doing it, you know. It just happens.

**Speaker B:** And so there you go with that two-tiered system. Yeah, America experimented for a while with a three-tiered system in the sense of the working class, the middle class, which is just more wealthy lower class, and then the upper class, right? And that upper class then is the idea of the teacher versus the student. It's a divisional system, right? Mother and child, boss-employee, officer. Yeah, all of that is a two-tiered system. And in Buddhism in the West, that's system remains. The teacher and the student, the doctor and the patient. Yeah, the psychotherapist and the client, the politician and the voter. It's all this duality that is built into our system. And what we need to come back to is the integration of those two. And this is where the, uh, the the Kaliya Metta concept comes in, is that when someone is new to Buddhism, the teacher's job is to bring that student up to his level, right? Because rather than keep him one down, right? This is one example of that would be when Buddhadasa was getting really old He would talk about everybody be a Buddhadasa. Oh, your job is to be a Buddhadasa. Don't go suck up to Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. Be one. Be him. Be him. We come out of that one-down position. Yeah. Become your own boss. Be on top of the world. Well, how can that be taught by someone who wants himself to be on top of your world, right?

**Speaker A:** I can't. It's not possible.

**Speaker B:** So this is where real teacher training is, is the real teacher training is the training for the teacher to depart to the student, that the student is really a teacher. He's really going to become as high as he thinks his guru is. Now, one of the disadvantages that our culture has is that we take and place people at very, very high levels like they're very special, right? That guru thing, it comes, I think, out of Christianity, that Jesus himself had a lot of good advice, but he made some mistakes.

**Speaker A:** You know what?

**Speaker B:** He was— he wasn't perfect. But by the time we hear about him later, he's a god, right? They take him and throw him way high up in the air, and then.

**Speaker A:** Nobody can ever get near him again.

**Speaker B:** And then nobody can get near that again.

**Speaker A:** But you know what, I remember in the Bible, I remember them saying to Jesus— I don't remember which of his two it was— but they were asking him, hey, which one of us can get it with you in heaven? You know, like, which one of us is going to sit by you? And he immediately got down and he began to wash their and he washed their feet and washed their feet and washed, and they were like, what are you doing? He's like, that's not how it works. He's like, you're not, you know, he just washed their feet instead of saying like, oh yeah, you'll be elevated to where I'm at.

**Speaker B:** And I always trying to point down to point to him is, is that he's already down to their level, right?

**Speaker A:** That they're already all sitting right there together.

**Speaker B:** And so, this idea of elevating the teacher and having great respect for the teacher is the problem, rather than recognizing, "Oh, this teacher has something marvelous to offer, let's take it!" This is the idea then of that mural that's on the side of the building there at Watsuo-en-moku that is in an Anagami, The Eye of the Dharma. Egyptian, right? The Eye of the Dhamma. That one guy is sitting there with a basket full of eyes, but he's giving them away. And so you have one guy who is bowing in gratitude. Thank you, I've got the eye. Another one is screwing the eye on, making sure that it's working. A third guy is just receiving his eye. And then up in the top corner you have a whole mass of stick figures running away. Yeah, they don't want— why are they running away is because they don't see themselves as one with the Dhamma.

**Speaker A:** I— oh yeah, I was thinking about this earlier today when I was thinking—.

**Speaker B:** Hey, hang on, Keishon is calling. I'm going to bring him in. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Hey, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** Hello. I'm on the phone with Alex now. I've been waiting for you to call. I thought that you would. You're pretty late. Anyway, we're in the process or just about to finish up with the idea of what a teacher's job in the Dharma is. Is to bring the student out of the position of being a student into becoming his own guru, to be his own star. And this is what real teacher training is, is to teach the student how to be his own guru, how to be his own boss, how to not need another teacher. So anyway, good to see you, Keishon. Good to see you too, Dhammarato. We've been talking about teachers for about an hour now. Why don't we finish this call? You guys stay on and we'll just finish the call and we'll turn the recording.

**Speaker A:** Off.

**Speaker B:** I think that we've gotten it pretty well positioned that the job of OSF is not to train teachers, but to connect them with people who would be a good teacher for them so that they can move into the wat, gain the experience of the abbot of the wat, and then the abbot is soon going to be putting the teacher or the new student in the teacher's position. You've already seen that happen with you, haven't you, Kishan? That when you were going to the wat, they were beginning to give you responsibility. Oh, why don't you teach English to the monks? That would be an excellent thing because then you're spending your time with the monks. And while you're teaching them English, They're teaching you happiness.

**Speaker A:** That's a good trade.

**Speaker B:** All right, so let's finish this call. Hang on there with it and we'll, uh, turn the recorder off.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, the core summary is a critique of hierarchical, commercialized spiritual and therapeutic models, and a prescription for authentic Dhamma practice and teacher-student relationships.

Here are the key points:

**1. The Problem with Labels and Authority:**
*   The discussion begins by critiquing diagnostic labels in psychotherapy (like ADHD), comparing them to a "thicket of views." These labels can become identities and excuses, preventing genuine healing and self-investigation.
*   This extends to spiritual settings, where blind faith in gurus or teachers leads to a collapse of critical inquiry. The principle is: trust the Dhamma, but investigate everything and everyone else.

**2. The Failure of Commercial and Hierarchical Models:**
*   Speaker B (Dhammarato) shares his disillusionment with fraudulent gurus (Muktananda, Osho, Sai Baba) and the business model of Western Buddhism and psychotherapy.
*   He criticizes retreats and teacher training programs that are transactional—you pay, you get a time-bound experience, and the relationship ends. This creates a permanent, inferior "student" or "client" role.

**3. The Authentic Teacher-Student Relationship:**
*   The ideal is not a permanent hierarchy, but a **spiritual friendship (*kalyāṇamittatā*)**. The teacher's true job is to elevate the student to their own level, to make the student their own teacher and "boss."
*   True teachers, like Ajahn Po and Buddhadasa, *care* and demonstrate generosity without charge. They aim to make the student independent, not dependent.

**4. Real "Teacher Training" is Apprenticeship, Not a Course:**
*   Authentic training happens through immersion and apprenticeship, not paid certification programs. It's modeled on how the Buddha trained his monks or how Bhikkhu Buddhadasa trained Dhammarato—by suddenly putting them in the teaching role to learn by doing, under the watchful eye of a master.
*   This is compared to old-fashioned teacher training schools where student teachers taught in real classrooms under supervision.

**5. The Role of the Open Sangha Foundation (OSF):**
*   OSF should not become another commercial teacher-training school. Instead, its role is like an "HR department" or connector.
*   It should help sincere practitioners find authentic monastic communities (*wats*) where they can immerse themselves, be supported by the generosity of the laity, and learn through service and gradual responsibility under a qualified abbot.

**6. The Core Practice: Overcoming Instinct and Conditioning:**
*   Underlying all of this is the need for continuous practice (*ānāpānasati* - mindfulness of breathing) to overcome our deep-seated survival instincts and societal conditioning (the "herd instinct").
*   Practice is for "right now," moment by moment, to break free from the dualities (teacher/student, boss/worker, officer/enlisted) built into our systems.

**In essence:** The talk advocates for a return to a generous, relational, and non-commercial Dhamma practice. It emphasizes investigation over blind faith, spiritual friendship over guru worship, and immersive apprenticeship over paid certification, all aimed at the student's ultimate independence and ability to hold all experience without discrimination.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used in the talk:

### **Metaphors & Analogies:**

1.  **"The CIA, in God we trust, in all else we investigate."**
    *   **Used by:** Speaker A.
    *   **Purpose:** To argue against blind faith in spiritual or therapeutic authority. The metaphor advocates for maintaining a stance of continuous, critical investigation in all relationships except a hypothetical perfect one ("God").

2.  **"Go down that rat hole"**
    *   **Used by:** Speaker B.
    *   **Purpose:** Describes the futile and complex effort of creating diagnostic codes (DSM) to convince insurance companies of the legitimacy of mental health treatment.

3.  **"Thicket of views" / "Thicket of chemically reinforced views"**
    *   **Used by:** Speaker A, referencing the Buddha.
    *   **Purpose:** Compares the confusing, entangled, and misleading nature of philosophical or psychological labels to an impenetrable thicket. The adaptation ("chemically reinforced") extends the metaphor to critique over-reliance on psychiatric medication.

4.  **"Samsara light"**
    *   **Used by:** Speaker A.
    *   **Purpose:** Critiques Western Buddhism and psychotherapy that have become a comfortable "business model." It's like a "lite" version of suffering (*samsara*)—it doesn't liberate you, it just makes bondage more pleasant.

5.  **The Broken Arm vs. Technical Diagnosis**
    *   **Used by:** Speaker B.
    *   **Purpose:** Contrasts a simple, functional understanding ("you've got a broken arm") with an overly complex technical diagnosis (e.g., specifying the bone). This argues that diagnostic labels in therapy are often for the practitioner/system, not the client, and can be detrimental when internalized by the client.

6.  **Mommy vs. Daddy Relationship**
    *   **Used by:** Speaker B.
    *   **Purpose:** Contrasts two models of teaching/care:
        *   **Mommy:** Wants to keep the child dependent forever (analogous to a guru or therapist who keeps the student/client in a subordinate role).
        *   **Daddy:** Tells the child to "grow up and be a man" (analogous to a true Dharma teacher whose goal is to make the student independent and equal).

7.  **The Two-Tiered / Class System**
    *   **Used by:** Both speakers.
    *   **Purpose:** Repeatedly compares the hierarchical teacher-student or therapist-client model to other oppressive dualities: officer/enlisted, boss/employee, aristocracy/commoner, politician/voter. This frames the critique as one against inherent, disempowering hierarchy.

8.  **"The Eye of the Dhamma" Mural**
    *   **Used by:** Speaker B.
    *   **Purpose:** Describes a painting at Wat Suan Mokkh where a figure gives away eyes (Dharma understanding). It illustrates different reactions: gratitude, practical application, reception, and rejection (those who run away because they don't see themselves as one with the Dharma). This symbolizes the teacher's role as a generous giver of insight, not a hoarder of status.

### **Stories & Anecdotes:**

1.  **The Disillusionment with Gurus in India:**
    *   **Told by:** Speaker B.
    *   **Key Figures:** Muktananda, Osho (Rajneesh), Sathya Sai Baba.
    *   **Purpose:** To explain Speaker B's journey from psychotherapy to Buddhism. The stories of encountering fraud, hypocrisy, and "guru worship" in Hindu traditions led to disillusionment and a search for a more authentic, less hierarchical path, which he found in Theravada Buddhism.

2.  **Being Thrown into Teaching by Masters:**
    *   **Told by:** Speaker B.
    *   **Key Figures:** Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and Ajahn Po.
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate the authentic "teacher training" method in traditional Buddhism. The stories of being unexpectedly asked to teach in front of these masters (e.g., on the Four Noble Truths, the Seven Factors of Enlightenment) emphasize that real training is experiential, immersive, and designed to build independence, not perpetuate dependency.

3.  **The Winthrop Training School:**
    *   **Told by:** Speaker B.
    *   **Purpose:** Provides a Western educational analogy for the ideal Dharma teacher training. Student-teachers taught real classes but with master teachers observing and correcting them in real-time. This mirrors the method used by Buddhadasa and Ajahn Po.

4.  **The Story of Cat (and potential for Pedro):**
    *   **Told by:** Speaker B.
    *   **Purpose:** A contemporary, positive example of the ideal student-teacher relationship. Cat, living at a Thai wat, is experiencing the generosity of the abbot and is expected to be gradually given teaching responsibilities. This story models how the Open Sangha Foundation (OSF) should function—as a connector, not a school—guiding Westerners to authentic training environments in existing monastic communities.

5.  **Jesus Washing the Disciples' Feet:**
    *   **Referenced by:** Speaker A.
    *   **Purpose:** To support the argument against hierarchy. The biblical story is used to show that a true teacher (like Jesus in this act) dismantles status differences and serves the student, embodying the principle of elevating the student to equality.

**Overall Theme of the Metaphors and Stories:** They consistently contrast two models: a **hierarchical, commercial, dependency-perpetuating model** (Western psychotherapy, guru cults, business-like Buddhism) with an **egalitarian, generous, empowerment-focused model** (authentic Dharma teaching as spiritual friendship or *kalyāṇa-mittatā*). The stories trace Speaker B's personal journey from the first model to the second and outline a vision for how to cultivate the second in the West.
