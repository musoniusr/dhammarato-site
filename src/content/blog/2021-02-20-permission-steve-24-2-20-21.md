### Transcript


**Speaker A:** couple of them.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there it started. Now, there was a Guru Viking episode number 20 where he asked me some of the stuff about what happened a long time ago. And so I don't think that this part of the story was in what I told him. But basically, I left Goenka feeling like he wasn't teaching enough, that there was something missing, not just in my own practice, but in the way that they were teaching. There was something missing. That was the strong feeling that I got. And I think fairly soon after that, I wound up in Bodh Gaya.

**Speaker A:** India.

**Speaker B:** In India, right. But you see, Goenka was in Igatpuri, which is in Maharashtra state, kind of halfway or a bit between Bombay and Delhi, to where Bodhgaya is much closer to Calcutta. That would be the largest city, or Varanasi would be another city in that vicinity, actually closer to Varanasi. So I don't know if you've been to India. I mentioned 4 cities, so I don't know if you know this area.

**Speaker A:** No, I mean, we— I kind of— I think I flew into, uh, Calcutta, um, was in the airport, but I kind of went down the, I guess it would be, down sort of west coast. So I did a yoga retreat in Tamil Nadu and then kind of went up to Goa and then kind of went down Kerala, like Cochin, Varkala, down South Point, Srivandrum, and then back up to— then I was running out of money, went back up to Mumbai, um, got lost in the city, had a bit of a scary kind of incident. You know what, I got, I've got one week left, I'm gonna go back down to Goa and just chill out for a week rather than, uh, um dealing with corrupt policemen and all this kind of thing.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, there's over in the Calcutta area, another city in that vicinity is Patna, and it's also one of the main kind of tourist backpackers' way of getting into Nepal, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so the north, sort of north.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we're in, in north Yeah, no one. East, northeast India area. Yeah, yeah, Varanasi. And this is the area that the Buddha hung out in. And in fact, his birthplace in the area that he actually was born would now be in modern-day Nepal. Really? Okay. And that also he was friends with the kings in the more southern areas in King Bimbisara and— oh, I forgot his name. I'll think of it in a moment. Bimbisara. And so that was the area that he lived in. And the idea then that there are four sacred places: the place where he was born, the place that he died, the enlightenment place, and the place that he first taught the Dhamma. And so all of those are in that whole vicinity there, that Bodh Gaya is the place where he became enlightened, and that's also the area where they were practicing heavy austerities. Naturally, if he goes to the very best austerity master in India, that's where he's going to give it up, is when he was there. And so that's the area of Brahmanism and austerities and a lot of stuff like that. And the Deer Park, that is the Tanha, is where he gave the Dhamma Chakra Bhikkhuni Sutta. He also was in Varanasi and he had a lot of followers in Varanasi, including Anicca, who was a kind of a banker of the day, and he was the one who was really— he was the moneybags, and he bought property from one of the princes to make a grove in that area for the monks to stay in. Okay, so anyway, that's where I was in Bodhgaya and Varanasi and Isitanya, but I was hanging out mostly in Bodhgaya. Reading the Visuddhimagga. And I did it, and I did a course with Christopher Titmuss there. I think that was in December 2000— excuse me, 1983, or was it 2082? Something like that. I think it's '83 I did it. Yeah, because, uh, uh, Shortly after that, I met a monk there at that temple. I was at Wat Thai Bodhgaya, and that's where I met this monk who actually— we had many conversations. He spoke fairly good English, and one day he caught me with the Visuddhimagga, and he actually took it away from me.

**Speaker A:** What, took it off you?

**Speaker B:** Like, he took it off of me, right? Here I am, I'm trying to quote to him out of the Visuddhimagga, and he takes it away from me, folds it up and kind of half throws it over onto the bed. And that's when he started, uh, deeper introductions to me about Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, that I got to go to Thailand. This is where I found out about Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, was in, uh Bhagaya.

**Speaker A:** Christopher, Christopher Titmuss talks about Buddhadasa. I think he studied with Buddhadasa as well.

**Speaker B:** He did too, yes. In fact, he was, uh, but it, it did, it took a while to click in. I think that, uh, Christopher is a much more subtle teacher, but the way that I, the reason that I teach the way that I do is because of conversations I've had with Ajahn Po, that not to teach Buddhism in two steps, in the mundane and the supramundane, and guide students part of the way through the mundane and then take them into the supramundane, which is the way for ordinary people. Because of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, Ajahn Po said, "No, the right way to do it is take the supramundane right from the very beginning." Let's teach the real teachings of the Buddha as if the people were actually ready for it. It's time to let the cat out of the bag, basically, which is what Bhikkhu Buddhadasa did. There's a very, very interesting story about what happened to him in the 1930s, was that he was an Anagami, a Pali scholar in Bangkok going through the various— they've got 9 levels of Pali studies, and I think he was like study number 6 or something like that. And so he was also doing public speaking. I think he had been a monk about 10 years by then. One group of lessons that he was giving had too many people in the audience who did not like what he was saying. I guess you could call them rebirthers, hardcore rebirthers. And so, they made a stir, and the stir got to the point that it became what is called an Anagami, which is an accusation that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa is trying to destroy or to tear apart the Sangha, a very, very severe act within the Sangha, that the whole idea of the Sangha is that it should be unified, and here he is doing things that's trying to destroy the Sangha.

**Speaker A:** Like a heretic.

**Speaker B:** He's a heretic, right? A hairy tick. Exactly.

**Speaker A:** And so, pain in the ass.

**Speaker B:** Like a big one. A very, very big one. And as you can see, that if you could keep the people believing, uh, like sheeple, that they are making merit by building temples and, uh, feeding the monks, that they'll continue to do so. That was the fear, that if the real noble Dharma came out, people would stop being generous for the wrong reasons. The reality is, is that when people begin to hear the truth, they become generous for the right reasons, for the sake of it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, for the— uh-huh.

**Speaker B:** Many times students ask if they could pay me, and I won't let them because I've got better plans. Get them hooked. So that they'll go and spread the Dhamma. And so this is how it goes, is the Dhamma should be freely given. And even a subtle manipulation, like, "Oh, if you feed the monks, you'll have a better life next life." is like a built-in scam or promise. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa didn't like the feeling of that. But because of historical circumstances, the nobility of the Dharma was not lost, wasn't ever lost, wasn't lost in Burma, wasn't lost in Sri Lanka, It was only lost in India because everything was lost in India. But the nobility was always there in the sense that it was nobles who brought Buddhism to Thailand. Therefore, the nobility is going to be implanted there as well as all of the formalities of the surface level of Buddhism, plus all of the beliefs that the people already had. So if the people already believed in reincarnation, the nobles are not going to try to beat it out of them. And that's why the nobility, the nobles and the ordinary people, lived side by side, or let us say, within the Sangha. So some of the Sangha was noble and some of it was not, but they were still monks for many, many years, they just never did quite figure out that, hey, they can give up their beliefs and be happy instead.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but it was kind of a necessary vehicle.

**Speaker B:** So actually, you could say then that magical thinking is necessary to get us started, but it's like the booster, uh, uh, the first primary stage rockets. Of putting a spacecraft up, that you need that really, really heavy energy to get this thing off into the air. But once you get up, you get into flight, you can jettison all of the crap and get on with the show with a primary rocket.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's the whole point originally.

**Speaker B:** Okay. And so magical thinking around the Dharma is what gets people launched into the Dharma, but then they have, in order to go into the outer space of the noble existence, they have to jettison all of those old beliefs.

**Speaker A:** Because it's about the reality which is

**Speaker B:** now, as opposed to— Exactly, exactly. But you see, you can think of it in three stages, and two of the stages can be thought of as the same predicament. Okay, let us actually, for just description's sake, put those in with the labels of atheists and Christians, just for discussion purposes, okay? Because it also happens within Buddhism, but it's a little more difficult to see. In Christianity, they say that the soul goes on, that it is strong enough to survive death and a good deal after that, but it's still not on its own because it's really nothing but a football for God to kick around. And so you got to suck up to God to get him to treat you well. Okay, so The atheist— so I was

**Speaker A:** just going to say, isn't it built in that in a way there's a kind of the more you suffer in this life, the kind of better really, you know what I mean? You're proving your worth. You're kind of, I'm such a— exactly so.

**Speaker B:** When you do all of the work that you've got to do, when you suffer enough, then you can get forgiveness or you'll finally get paid or something.

**Speaker A:** There's a kind of pride in that suffering that you're— yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's, that's the law of karma. You do good, you'll get good results. You do bad, you'll get bad results. No longer— no matter how long it takes, you'll eventually— it'll get— you'll get caught up with, so they say. And yet look at how many wealthy people got their wealth and keep their wealth by dirty dealing and shenanigans and manipulating, uh, politicians and But that's on

**Speaker A:** the mundane level, isn't it?

**Speaker B:** If you view it from— It's on every level.

**Speaker A:** So they probably don't— You're right.

**Speaker B:** You are right.

**Speaker A:** They don't sleep at night, you know, and they don't, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I'm just using that as an example. So, so to go into the mundane level means that we can assume that the student has already come far enough that they're ready to jettison that baggage anyway. So, back to the idea of an atheist, very few Christians are going to come talk to me on Skype and argue with me about— and whatnot. There's no reason for them to do that. So those that are believing in eternalism are not the issue. The ones who believe that that there is a soul that goes on and on.

**Speaker A:** Is that— is that eternalism? Is that what— is that what it means?

**Speaker B:** Right, that is eternalism. Okay. And in fact, there's two kinds of eternalism. Absolute eternalism means it keeps going on and keeps going on, and a trillion years after that, it keeps going on. And then there's the idea of eternalism that after trillions of years, eventually it will stop. But that that time is so far into the future that the result is the same as if it were eternalism. So eternalism and semi-eternalism are often bagged the same way, in the sense that there is something that keeps going on and on and on.

**Speaker A:** I've seen this in various teachings that I've looked into, you know, in our sort of gap, you know, like yoga teachings and sort of occult teachings and all sorts of stuff.

**Speaker B:** Okay, now let's contrast that to the second kind, which we will call atheist. And the atheists have the kind of belief is like that the existing being upon the breakup and death of the body is annihilated. This is annihilationism, that yes, here I am, I'm a human being, I thump my chest and I work at my job and all of that, but when I die, I'm dead. Now, both of those miss the point of the Buddhist teaching. So both eternalism, semi-eternalism, and annihilationism miss the point of the teaching of the Buddha. The third one is nihilism, and nihilism is absolute be against the teaching of the Buddha, and even the nihilists know that.

**Speaker A:** How are you defining— not so— nihilism would be what?

**Speaker B:** Like, nihilism would be like, oh, I can get away with anything. There is no Kamma, there is no result of anything, there's no mother, no father. I can go do what I damn well please and I can get away with it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I kind of thought it was like, like there's no meaning inherent.

**Speaker B:** There's no meaning either. I can go do what I want to do. There's no meaning. And in fact, because there's no meaning, I can go do what I want to do to try to find meaning. And I still don't find any meaning. And so I'm miserable, but I'm going to do what I want to do anyway.

**Speaker A:** I mean, maybe if you're a psychopath and you have no kind of remorse.

**Speaker B:** That's exactly it. That's psychopath. Okay. Or you could think of it as very, very primitive times in a dog, a truly dog-eat-dog totally competitive world where even the warlord is going to get knocked off by his lieutenants.

**Speaker A:** Just survival, just pure.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, just raw survival. Yeah, because if everybody's out just, I'm going to do anything I want to do, and if you stand in my way, you're dead.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there are strands of that, obviously you can see.

**Speaker B:** And so in fact, you could say that our civilization grew out of that. The civilization grew out of that. How does civilization grow out of that? It didn't grow out of it with pure wisdom. It grew out of it with retributions of punishment of you do bad behavior, the whole crowd is going to come after you.

**Speaker A:** It's a bit like this, like nuclear deterrent, I guess, where every country's got nuclear warheads and it kind of keeps the peace because— exactly, if China fires one, America's gonna fire one, and then we all blow ourselves up, and then kind of— it's all— exactly.

**Speaker B:** Which means, Matt, Mutual Assured Destruction means, guess what, nobody gets away with it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Now that is what the Buddha would call ordinary right view, and ordinary right view encompasses both annihilationism and eternalism and semi-eternalism. Ordinary right view, which basically means is that you will get punished for what you do wrong. Which means that you can teach that to children, whether it's a secular household or whether it's a religious household. The religious household just adds the no matter what, and adds hell as an example of no matter what. But secular people do the same thing with their kids. They try to teach them between right and wrong. And not only that, but they seem to learn it better. If you look at the statistics in the United States, county by county, those counties which are highly religious are very, very low in morality in the sense of there is more domestic violence, more alcoholism, more psychotherapy problems, more social issues, and those—

**Speaker A:** sorry, in the religious

**Speaker B:** family, in religious counties, the morality according to the statistics is lower, and in Counties that are atheist or have very low church membership generally have fewer deaths, fewer murders, fewer break-ins, fewer domestic violence, less alcoholism, less drug abuse.

**Speaker A:** What's the— do you know the reasons?

**Speaker B:** Because the kids believed what the parents told them, that, hey, the cop's going to come after you if you do that. Okay, yeah, but where the kids are told about hell, some of them believe it, many of them don't. They all believe in forgiveness. Oh, I've got to get out of hell free card here.

**Speaker A:** I'm a Christian, God loves me, it's all right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I can go do what I want to and God will forgive me. Get out of hell free card. And you can see where then Christianity and other religions, the morality spirals downward, not upward.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whereas like in a non-religious family, the, the parents saying, look, you misbehave, you're going to get a slap, you know what I mean? And so that's a, that's an actual— the kid can understand that sort of, you know.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so getting back then to the teachings of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, in Thailand there are already a lot of people who are Buddhist who did not believe in rebirth anyhow, just like there's a large number of atheists in the United States that don't believe in the afterlife that the Christians talk about, which means that those are the ones that are primed for the noble, because they've already got no— they can still live a life. They don't have to fall back into wrong view of all greed all the time, they actually become really interested in Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. That's why he's got such a mass following in Thailand. It's brilliant. But there was more to it than that, and that is that Bhikkhuni was noted on both sides. Not only was he noted by those who were strongly holding and critical of people talking against rebirth, and holding to that. But there were those who were also highly placed in Buddhism that knew that rebirth had nothing to do with the teachings of the Buddha. In short, there were already nobles in Thailand, some of them very, very highly and well placed. You could also go so far as to say that even the royal family of Thailand at one time was, let us say, akin to the nobles. Friendly with the nobles, having noble monks. There was one monk who disrobed in order for himself to become king. He gave up his monkship to become a king, and he was dead within 2 years. And that made everybody reminisce about what the Buddha said.

**Speaker A:** What sort of— this was 10 years ago, 20 years ago, or— no, this

**Speaker B:** actually, uh, he died in 1920. He disrobed in 1917. He was born in 1860. He was one of the 46 children of King Mongkut, and when he was 8 years old, King Chulalongkorn became the king, and that they were good friends, and King Chulalongkorn really supported what this monk wanted to do in the Dharma. And so they actually revolutionized the Dharma by bringing much more of the wholesome part of the Dharma into the public thinking anyway.

**Speaker A:** Does this link slightly to what you mentioned in the Guru Vaikuntha, you know, like a benign dictatorship in a way?

**Speaker B:** You kind of— that I was describing exactly the Thai government, always up until the last generation. It's kind of like, like you've been

**Speaker A:** the wise elders kind of have a strong influence and kind of make the rules because they can see it from a higher perspective, kind of what's good and good, really.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So our best example of that benign dictator or benign king is King Bimbisara, who was the friend of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa was friends with the royalty, but it comes from this Sangha to Sati that I was— the story I was about to to tell you about, because he made some really good friends in there and in fact picked up a very famous teacher. And that teacher actually went to visit Bhikkhu Buddhadasa at Wat Soan Mokkh. His name was Bhikkhu Buddhagosujjarn. Yeah, Bhikkhu Buddhagosujjarn, it was his name. And he was made some debt in 1920 by this very— or, uh, '17 by this very king. So that was the connection that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa had with the royal house already, was because his teacher, who was on that council in 1932, '33, something like that, when Bhikkhuni was put on trial— uh, the results of that trial, by the way, came out as he's teaching the correct Dhamma.

**Speaker A:** He was put on trial. You mean he was put on trial? You mean like he was put on

**Speaker B:** trial as Sangha decessor?

**Speaker A:** Like an actual court case in a way?

**Speaker B:** An actual court case of 20 monks. A Sangha decessor requires— sorry, I should have pointed that out to you. Yes, he was put up in a— in a— on a— on trial. But it was all the top monks in Bangkok, and some of them were noble. And knew the noble Dharma, and some of them were not. And they were the ones who— okay, so part of the trial, which lasted for months and months and months, actually turned out to be a Pali literature search, right? Because they were— because this group here that was on the side of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa thought that, yeah, maybe now's the time to let's do this. And so, there was an absolute literature research that actually started changing the way that the Thai monkhood at the top looked at things. And so, they wound up with the verdict was, just to get along with the old guard, was that he was teaching the correct Dhamma to the wrong people. Why? Because he was teaching it openly, and he continued his whole life to teach it openly. And the nobles that were supporting him— he was actually, he became quite famous because of that, and many of them then wanted him to be their teacher.

**Speaker A:** It was kind of good publicity in a way.

**Speaker B:** Like, it was, it was such good publicity being on trial. And being accused— or not accused, but being sentenced to teaching the right Dharma to the wrong people.

**Speaker A:** But that's going to draw out like the, the maybe the rebels and the kind of people that are, that, you know, kind of into that.

**Speaker B:** This story gives me so much respect for Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, on top of the fact that I actually knew him in his old age. Yeah, yeah. And so this is the story then that he is the one who said it is time to stop, how to say it, putting up with all of the belief systems that people have. If it's time for the Buddha, Dharma to become known worldwide, let's let the real show be known worldwide without having to take Asian stupidity and superstition along with it. Because there's so many Westerners that'll gobble that stuff right up. They came out of Christianity, but rebirth sounds like another ticket back into the afterlife. Because you can think of it is that the afterlife sounds very delicious. It must be marvelous. If I enjoy being alive a little bit now, maybe I'll enjoy more being alive next time.

**Speaker A:** But it's taken away from us, isn't it?

**Speaker B:** And not only that, but the thought of death is the fear of death. Thinking about dying— nobody wants to die. Why do people want to die when we have this instinct called the self-preservation instincts, whose major job is to keep us alive and winds up being that which always gets woken up to put us in hell. It is the waking up of this self-preservation, and it has many false positives. You could say that that's the self itself, is when the self-preservation instinct pops into place. And when it pops into place, it almost always does with fear, that that's the primary language of the self-preservation instinct. In the sense that things are dangerous right now. So if we can finally talk ourselves back into, hey man, things are not dangerous, I do not need that self or its preservation instinct to keep interfering with a wonderful life, because things are really not dangerous.

**Speaker A:** And the self-preservation instinct isn't— it hasn't got intelligence, as in a way, just it lashes out. It's, um, it makes your life worse. Like, you know, you could have a moment and end up in prison or whatever.

**Speaker B:** And that's right, people wind up in prison because of that momentary self-preservation instinct. They let it out.

**Speaker A:** It can be a strong feeling, though, can't it? And it can take over, you know, if you're not mindful, you know, you're not on the ball, right?

**Speaker B:** So in one flash, you can destroy a life or two or a bunch. But we can also see that in the small ways that it can pop up just for a short time, just enough to muck up this moment.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, definitely.

**Speaker B:** Doesn't have to muck up our whole lives and everybody's around us, but it can muck up a day.

**Speaker A:** But I guess that's when— that's the kind of the question, isn't it? If you're not happy right now, that survival instinct is doing it. It's doing something, no matter how subtly.

**Speaker B:** Exactly right. If you're not happy right now, That means the self-preservation instinct is doing something in there.

**Speaker A:** But I guess through socialization that it can get more and more subtle. So I'm not going to chop your head off, but I might have a little verbal dig and try to tear you down verbally. And then on another level, just like I said, gossip, it can get more and more refined, I guess. But at core, it's the same. It's the same thing, you know, you're trying to protect yourself.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay. Now what you're describing happens with everybody. You're talking about not just what you've observed in yourself, but you can extrapolate that with the teachings of the Buddha to recognize that that's very common. The human condition, yeah, it's a human condition, right? And that human condition there is there with both the Christians who believe in reincarnation and the Buddhists and Hindus and whatnot that believe in reincarnation and rebirth, and the atheists who don't believe in an afterlife, they still get caught, all of them, in that human condition that you're talking about.

**Speaker A:** I guess you could say the only difference between anyone like myself and someone on death row is maybe in certain moments I was better at controlling the survival instinct compared to the other guy, or maybe the other guy had so much alcohol in his system that he couldn't control himself.

**Speaker B:** Exactly so. So if you can see it that way and begin to notice it all, it is with Sati waking up and investigating what's going on more and more often, more and more clearly then the less likely it is I'm going to allow the self-preservation instinct to spring into gear and take over, or even spring into gear and influence. Maybe not even take over, but it does sometimes influence our behavior.

**Speaker A:** I guess that's so sharper and sharper levels of clarity.

**Speaker B:** That would be what would be called then nobility, is when the noble mind is the one that's sharp enough not to elect, not to allow the instinct to influence the wisdom.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I think sometimes you come to this if you've come close to being really burnt, you know. And cool, you said in that talk that I listened to last night with Guru Vaikuntha, you know, it's, uh, sometimes you catch yourself halfway through, sometimes it's kind of too late. And the optimum would be to catch it, you know, that point of contact, so you don't go down that path at all. But You know, sometimes you might catch yourself 30 seconds into it, sometimes 3 days into it, and sometimes, you know, 30 years into it and think, what have I done? Why that from that seed? You know, I guess I'm proud of

**Speaker B:** you for remembering that because that was one of the things that I would have liked to have gone over again several times to grind that in for people. And I only mentioned it one time and you picked right up on it.

**Speaker A:** I feel like I'm coming to the Dharma again for you because it is— I can understand why people say like they're seeking refuge, you know. Is you see the wisdom in the teaching and you see the danger, you know. You don't want to let the danger just ruin your enjoyment of life, but you know, it's there and it's— you want to— and that's why I can see why you would dedicate maybe becoming a monk or something, because the optimum conditions— get this thing sorted out first, you know. It's, uh, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Um, I was in the US Navy, and because of that I got several things ingrained the way that the Navy guys look at things. And when you use the word refuge, what springs to mind for me is a harbor, a safe harbor. Okay, like the world is actually the high seas, the— where the other way of looking at it, no, you come ashore, you come back to the world when you're on the high seas. But when you're on the high seas, that's basically the world that the sailor wants to escape from. So he's looking for that safe harbor. Okay, so that refuge or the safe harbor, the Dhamma, is really a safe harbor from the high seas of the mind, the heavy seas. You know what I'm talking about?

**Speaker A:** The wisdom to navigate, you know, and to find that, you know, to navigate and in this world, because there's always going to be a better path of action.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, when I say high seas, I'm also talking about the wind and the rain and the storm. And there's a lot of storms in life when we're dealing with the world. And so that refuge or that safe harbor or getting out of the storm is, and then we recognize, wait a minute, when I sit down to meditation and I get away from all of that storm, I recognize I brought my own tempest. I've now got a tempest in a teapot.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, 100%.

**Speaker B:** And when we recognize that's where the real storm is, is on the inside, now we recognize, oh, but we can still use the Dharma for refuge from even that storm.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's just navigating the interior landscape, the interior.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly. So now we begin to manage the interior landscape so that we can stay away from our own storms.

**Speaker A:** And yeah, and we spoke about last time that, you know, when you can put a roadblock up in a highway just to stop a whole load of problems later down the road just by one simple act. Take a right instead of going over that bridge.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. To think of how much damage that you save and not have by putting your ship into safe harbor as opposed to leaving it out in the storm. If you leave your ship out in the storm, it's going to have a whole lot of damage and it's going you're going to have a whole lot of work that you got to do to get it back repaired again, but you can bring it into safe harbor.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and it might sound kind of exciting, but when you kind of lose a taste for that kind of Dukkha, of adrenaline, you know, and you don't want to play the hero anymore, you know.

**Speaker B:** I know. So that's part of growing up, isn't it? Because there's a part of us as kids that we like those high seas.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's why I like sort of reading like thriller novels and kind of like soldiers and all this kind of stuff. But in reality, you know, it doesn't feel very nice, does it? You know,

**Speaker B:** so in that regard, it doesn't really matter. And that was the part that it was hard for me to get quite through to, uh, to Steve on Guru Viking, was that it— since the storm of life that we're talking about happens to both the atheist and the Christian, then it doesn't matter what the Christian believes that's different than what the atheist believes. They both are caught in the storm. Yeah, maybe so. It doesn't matter for the Buddhist whether he believes in reincarnation or not. That's an irrelevant belief. The question is, can he come out of the storm right now?

**Speaker A:** Because you got the skill. The atheist might— the atheist might be just— it's another type of belief. He might— he might believe, like, I don't believe in God, but everything he does, kind of, it back deep down somewhere inside himself, he still believes in God. Maybe, you know, he, uh, you know,

**Speaker B:** he might say he still believes that he's a victim. He's just not quite so sure of what he's a victim of now.

**Speaker A:** Maybe, yeah, the government, or

**Speaker B:** right, or the boss, or of YD. I mean, there's a whole lot of different bosses out there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, or the missus, or, you know, right, exactly. So he's still a victim. That's, that's the core thing. He's still a victim. If you're saying anything If you're unhappy for any reason, really, you're a victim.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. So that victimhood is the same no matter what anybody believes. So whether they believe in anything or not is not the issue. It's an irrelevant topic.

**Speaker A:** Are they suffering or not?

**Speaker B:** Right. They're both suffering. Can we come out of our suffering right in this very life? That's the question. And you can see that many Buddhists in Thailand actually rob themselves of asking the right question because somehow or another they've got the idea of, "Oh, it's too hard to do now. Let me make some merit and I'll get out of my troubles next life." That's a very common belief, and I think that it actually is Well, it's part of the mass propaganda. It's a very common belief.

**Speaker A:** I think the thing that's coming into my mind is it's almost like with money in the West, it's almost like you believe you can buy your way out of anything. Like, you know, you can, but you can't. If you're suffering, if you feel it, if you're in the hell realms, you're feeling anxiety or any of this sort of stuff. It doesn't matter if you're a billionaire or you haven't got one P. It doesn't really matter. You can't, you can't. You can't buy yourself out of that. You can distract, maybe you might buy some heroin or something and distract yourself, but you know, you're going to come back, you're going to come back again, aren't you?

**Speaker B:** You know, that, that I would say, um, has been well known for a long time. Uh, the Buddha recommended that also, is to not apply or to try to gain monetary wealth, that the monks themselves were— a lot of people think that they were not allowed to handle money, and that's not true. It depends upon what we define money, but actually the precept is jatarupa rajata patikahana. Patikahana means to receive, so jatarupa rajata is actually gold and silver specifically, and in bullion form. Not coinage, that even the archaeology has proven that there was no coinage that was done in gold and silver, that it was all brass and copper and tin. They've dug it up, they know what it was. They've even found wooden coins. Even in the time of the Buddha, they had wooden nickels.

**Speaker A:** But I guess if you're coming at it from like— I guess it would be a subset of like, say, right livelihood Again, the not handling money is a right, rights, rules, and regulations.

**Speaker B:** If you don't know, if you've got, if you've got pocket change, that just makes things easy. If you've got a huge stash, now you've got to guard it.

**Speaker A:** It's true.

**Speaker B:** Okay, but in time, and you can see those. Here's an example of that, by the way, just, uh, and we'll get on, on with it. But in, in Thailand the law of the land, and this is a Buddhist country, they pride themselves on being Buddhist, and still the monks have to pay half price. Now generally the monks don't have any trouble finding somebody at the train station that's going to buy their half-price ticket for them. That's easy enough to do. But many of them don't, but they get the money someplace for the ticket. But the point that I'm making is that if the monks in Thailand were known to not be able to handle money as a rule, then the law would be that monks would travel free instead of half price. And yet a lot of people in the West think that, "Oh, the monks can't handle any money at all." No, they can handle a little bit. What is their limit? How much can they stand before they fall over in greed?

**Speaker A:** How big are the pockets on the robes? I guess, right?

**Speaker B:** How big are your pockets? Exactly, exactly. There are stories, and one of them is, is that after this old monk died, they went into his private quarters. Nobody had been in there in years, and the whole place was stacked with money, absolutely stacked from floor to ceiling, mostly with 20 baht notes, which is the smallest baht note that they have in Thailand. And also great big sacks of money, except that when you looked at the, the coinage in there, much of it was already in a little plastic bag of its own. Because in Thailand, what they do is, on birthdays, people will give— like on your 47th birthday, you will get 47 little bags of money, each one of them containing 47 baht. And you go out and give one bag of 47 baht to every monk until you've given 47 of them. And that's your birthday gift to the monks. And some of those monks will take that bag of money and just toss it over on the corner until finally they got to clean up. And so here you got this old monk that he's got this whole place is absolutely loaded down with money, wound up being not that much. I mean, it was under $20,000, but oh, such a scandal. Instead of being really proud of him, he never spent any of that money. People gave it to him as gift and he just put it there. He didn't care enough about it at

**Speaker A:** all because he's worthless to him, really.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. Or enough of it was enough.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, just, yeah, for the bus ride.

**Speaker B:** For the bus ride. Or maybe he needs a new razor and he asked his buddy to go get it and he'll give him the money for it, and you know, that kind of stuff. Yeah, because most of the stuff is given anyway, and so there's very little that the monks need, but the people want to be generous. And it doesn't matter whether they believe in rebirth, they still want to be generous to the monks.

**Speaker A:** Makes them feel good.

**Speaker B:** And so belief in rebirth just is kind of irrelevant. But you can see where the value is. It is that that's the way to control people, is to tell them, if you're a runaway slave, if you run away, even if you don't get caught— you probably will because we've got people up there, they're going to catch you and bring you back here and we're going to beat the tar out of you— but even if you escape completely, you know that our God is going to come after to you. And so that's the way that it's been all along, is this idea of this Kamma, is, is that you can't get away from us.

**Speaker A:** We, we spoke last time about this kind of fourth level of karma, didn't we?

**Speaker B:** Um, right.

**Speaker A:** And last time I was just— I've been thinking about that. I'm just trying to find my Notes.

**Speaker B:** So it's the— yeah, the comma that is at the end of Kamma, which is the comma. I remember talking to you about that. Yes, it's so profound, this teaching of the Buddha, that we should have actions that are only useful in this present moment. And if we behave, start behaving like that, we begin to behave less and less with future intentions.

**Speaker A:** Those roadblocks. So I've been thinking about this because it's sort of— I want to understand this, you know, this is something to do with like the super mundane level, I guess.

**Speaker B:** This is super mundane.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and just thinking about it, yeah, and it's almost like, yeah, the action to end action. And I guess sometimes, and I think it's a lot of this is to do with what you don't do rather than what you do do.

**Speaker B:** You know, and what we do do is often make a mess.

**Speaker A:** So just don't do— that's that roadblock in the highway.

**Speaker B:** Just— yeah, so we begin to restrain ourselves. That word is used fairly often in Buddhism, in the suttas, is that we have restraint. Here's an example of restraint, is that if someone is, let us say, decides that they're going to go on a diet The place to have that diet is at the grocery store. Why is that? Because there they will restrain themselves from purchasing that stuff and taking it home, because it's easier to restrain one time at the store than it is to restrain ourselves every day when we've got it at home. So, this is what we mean by restraint. If we can restrain the senses in the way so that we're only looking at wholesome, then we don't have to filter out the unwholesome. So not only do we have thoughts that are wholesome, we begin to monitor where we go and what we do and that kind of stuff to keep everything wholesome. And so we restrain our behaviors and actions and whatnot like that, being content with very little, which now means that there's even less to do. And so this is the comma that brings the end of comma, is the comma of wisdom, of recognizing that, hey, if I'm not going to get any benefit out of it right now, what's the point of doing it?

**Speaker A:** That was one of the first things, like, I remember we ever spoke about, and it, you know, I liked it because, you know, you said basically if you, if you don't want anything, you kind of— no one can get you. You kind of No, you can't be corrupted because you don't want anything anyway, you know. Like, that's, you know, isn't that brilliant? Yeah, that's absolutely brilliant.

**Speaker B:** It's really hard to con people who don't want anything because how are you

**Speaker A:** going to get to them? What angle are you going to try

**Speaker B:** to— Exactly, you know, playing on our emotions one way or the other. This is what it's all about, is propaganda. Is to get us to really hate that or get us to really want this. And when we do that to a whole lot of people, you've got a revolution on your hands that perhaps you didn't need at all.

**Speaker A:** And that's why— so what was the one of the steps of Anapanasati? Anapanasati is— I mean, it's been a long time since I looked into this, but Vedapassana or something, is that the right word?

**Speaker B:** Vedanupassana is the feelings. Okay, if they cannot manipulate your feelings, they can't manipulate you.

**Speaker A:** That's so cool, don't it?

**Speaker B:** You know,

**Speaker A:** that's so cool. There's so much going on all the time, you know, with media and just everywhere, you know, to sort of— that's

**Speaker B:** what Sati is all about, is to wake up and look at how we're feeling, because how we're feeling may be in the process of being manipulated right now, or we're having thoughts about it that it was manipulated, being manipulating it all over again.

**Speaker A:** And like you said in that talk with Guru Vaikunthi last night, you know, you kind of, you learn these feelings as well. You know, you learn, you know, you learn from your, you copy your, your mom or your dad and how they dealt in a situation. And oh look, when my sister sort of cried like that one time, she got given the toy, so hey, maybe I'll cry like that this time, you know.

**Speaker B:** And all I got was slapped.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. 100%. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's, that's, that's, yeah, that's, that's, that is a part of my conditioning. That's how it feels actually. But I was a little. She was the angel, but that's another.

**Speaker B:** I know, I know. And we wind up resenting that for a long time. And guess who's the one who has to deal with resentment now? Exactly.

**Speaker A:** Every time, it's funny, it's funny you say that because, you know, I don't see my parents very often. They live like an hour away. But it's funny how you, when you're back there, you're transported, you know, these feelings that have kind of been latent, you know, and they come back to the surface again, you know, and all of a sudden you're back being 7 again and in your parents' house and the same dynamics and the same, just the same stuff, like, you know,

**Speaker B:** it's, you know, then you come— part of the reason that they behave so much like they did is because they know that you expect that of them and you do the same thing. And so everybody is almost like an unspoken rule that we can't be who we are now. We've got to pretend to be who we were back when.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And you can— everybody does it, and everybody gets into the same war.

**Speaker A:** It's seductive, you know, to step back into these roles. And, and you— and it takes a lot of, say, presence of mind to, to catch yourself in the act and think, I'm 37 now.

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** You know. Um, so, uh, so, you know,

**Speaker B:** and this person in front of me is not my dad. No. Even though he thinks so.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And I'm going to meet this guy right where he is right now, not the way that I met him when I was 5.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah. See him as a human being, you know.

**Speaker B:** Uh, he was a real human being right here, right now. Rather than some— many times we do not want to do that. We want the parents to remain the way we remember them to be.

**Speaker A:** Well, you said it's an unwritten contract where you both played a role, you know, you both got a role in this, you know, you know, good mom, bad son, or, uh, you know, I

**Speaker B:** guess that's whatever that old role was, we go right back into it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. Unless I say we take control, you know, I guess. And, um, you know, we see that clearly and decide not to go down that path again, to be proud. I guess, I guess you're not, you're not being, you're not in the here now, are you, when you're, when you're doing that? You've slipped back 30 years or something, you know. And, and you're not exactly sure, you're not dealing with the reality right now, you know. You're, you're coming out from the old the history, you know, it's, um, in, in like a robot, you know, like, you know, he's gone to sleep again.

**Speaker B:** One thing's for sure, and that is it is much, uh, let us say, is much beneficial for one to go into that and to have some Dhamma with them, have some Dhamma under the belt. If they're a Dharma dude, they can handle that situation of going home a lot better.

**Speaker A:** It's a test, is it? You can— you could see it as a challenge, you know, as a— it

**Speaker B:** is, it really is. And not only that, but it's quite insightful sometimes too, to recognize what's going on, or how I can see in them now how things used to be precisely. I can see it now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, 100%. And it breaks the spell, maybe, you know.

**Speaker B:** That's right. And, and having that spell broken right in front of you is quite liberating to see those chains fall away.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. And you see exactly, you could have a— you could— I remember always idolizing my dad, you know, he was Superman, you know. And I kind of remember as you saw growing up and seeing, you know, that, you know, maybe he's not so great all the time, you know.

**Speaker B:** And, and that's okay now. I don't have to hold him in that high ideal. He doesn't— he never met up to that anyway. No, that never was who he was. It was my idea who he was. I don't— we all do that with our dad.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And when he, you know, when he was, you know, going crazy and, you know, whatever, um, you know, misbehaving quite badly, you know, you could say that's when you could have some compassion and think that he was, he was really scared back then. He was worried about losing his job, and, and he, and he didn't know how to deal with it. You know, he didn't know, he didn't have the skills to deal with it.

**Speaker B:** So he wasn't— which gives you even more oomph to figure those things out for yourself. Yeah, that you can use his misery as your education. Yeah, and determination and enthusiasm to come out of that stuff. Yeah, you can break it in one generation.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I believe that. And then that way you are doing some good in the world as well, you know.

**Speaker B:** Exactly so, exactly so. We're not just surviving anymore, now we're living.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you're kind of thriving and kind of turning a kind of negative into a positive. Transforming it, I guess.

**Speaker B:** Precisely. Or better still, leaving the positive and the negative as is and dropping positive and negative. Instead of dwelling on the positive and hoping to get rid of the negative, get rid of it all and be satisfied with nurturing rather than criticism. It already is all good. Yeah, you don't have to accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative. We don't have to do that. It's already just fine like it is.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, that's interesting you say that. I'll take that away and have some thought with that, because you automatically assume that you should be— I guess it's something to do with karma, that you accentuate the positive, you know. But I guess sometimes accentuating the positive is just smearing over the negative, glossing over.

**Speaker B:** Exactly, exactly.

**Speaker A:** That yin-yang symbol, like, you know, it's, you know, when every, you know, the white bit's got a bit of black in it and the black's got a bit of white in it, and it's sort of, it will turn into its opposite eventually. Like love, if you're you can fall in love with someone and kind of hate them. Like, you know, you can go from love to hate when your expectations are

**Speaker B:** kind of— in the movies it's backwards. They throw these two people together in combat or something and they hate each other, and then after a while they love each other. End of movie. They don't go to the second part of it, and that's when they— after they fall in love with each other, now they start the war.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You're not the person I thought you were, and it's because you were blind anyway. You didn't see it. You were blinded by the the drug of love, you know, like the oxytocin and the glamour and all this. Didn't see the fish hook.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. Blind by the adrenaline, blind by the oxytocin, and now blind back by the adrenaline again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's a cycle.

**Speaker B:** And that's right. And so the thing to do is to get out of that cycle. And when you do, everything is beautiful. Everything is marvelous. We don't need that cycle. The problem is that it keeps going like that. In that cycle. That's the Samsara wheel that the Buddhist talks about. Get out of that thing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you're saying reality doesn't need that lipstick put on it, you know. It's all right enough as it is.

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** Don't need to tart it up, you know, because if you were taking it all in, you would see it was all right anyway, just as it is, you know, the crack in the window. It's fine.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. Everything is all right. Everything is fine. This is the way to look at it, as opposed to, I know what good is and we're going to get it. You hear that difference? Everything is all right. Everything is fine. No worries. Versus, I know what's good and we're going to get it.

**Speaker A:** And that, when you say that, I've got images of like Christian evangelicals, for example, Like, like, they're so, you know,

**Speaker B:** they're— God has a war with it. I mean, the war of good and evil, that's the whole show. That's it, having that war. Let's get out of that war. We don't need wars with gods and hell and devils.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you know, I mean, as well, like, the preacher, he's kind of, you know, he says it with such fervor and such against you know, I don't know, prostitutes.

**Speaker B:** Oh, it's important.

**Speaker A:** He's talking about, you know, he's— and prostitutes are evil and all this kind of stuff. And it turns out, you know, in the papers later that, you know, he was seeing some prostitutes. You know, it's just, you know, it's the— so he was— those red lights are sneaky. But, you know, I mean, though, he's, you know, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Well, Steve, I've really enjoyed our little conversation, and I really appreciate you having so much to say about the video that Steve and I did yesterday. I'm glad to hear that you're getting it, you're coming back into the groove. I'm glad to hear that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's all there again. I'm happy as well because I thought I'd kind of, you know, I'd led myself to believe that I screwed it all up and kind of forgotten it all. And but it's It's not— start again. Exactly, exactly. It's just the— exactly, every, every day, that's, that's the forgiveness. That's the forgiveness right there, isn't it? You've got another chance.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I don't need to forgive myself. I can just forgive what I did wrong.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but you know what I'm saying? You're like, there's a, there's a kind of every— because every moment is new, there's, there's kind of the blessing.

**Speaker B:** Who is that dude anyway?

**Speaker A:** So yeah, kind of. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, that really helped me what you said about that, because I— when we first started talking again, I thought it's coming from a place where I'd, you know, sort of messed up a little bit, you know, in a, you know, so recently. And, you know, I can— with resolve, I can say I'm not going to do that again, you know. I know, and that's the forgiveness right there, you know. It's, um, can't change the past.

**Speaker B:** That resolution is the— is the better forgiveness.

**Speaker A:** And it's a learning. It was a learning. If I hadn't learned it then, who knows what happened down the line, you know, something worse.

**Speaker B:** Well, here you are now, and that's the important thing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I was seeking refuge. That's, that's— and as you said, I was— and that's the wisdom, you know. I'm seeking that wisdom, you know, which is in here anyway. Yeah, you know, so,

**Speaker B:** okay, we'll see you later. I'm really glad to see you back again.

**Speaker A:** Really nice to see you, Dhammarato. So have a nice evening.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it's about that time, isn't it?

**Speaker A:** Okay, see you soon, Dhammarato. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, primarily led by **Dhammarato (Speaker B)**, is a wide-ranging, informal conversation covering several key themes in his approach to the Buddha's teachings. Here is a summary of the core topics discussed:

### **Core Themes & Summary**

1.  **The "Real" Dhamma vs. Popular Belief:** A central thread is the distinction between the "noble" or "supramundane" Dhamma and the "mundane" level of popular Buddhist beliefs. Dhammarato recounts the story of **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa**, who was put on trial in Thailand for teaching the "correct Dhamma to the wrong people"—that is, teaching the core, present-moment teachings openly instead of upholding traditional beliefs like literal rebirth and merit-making for future lives. The talk positions this direct, here-and-now teaching as the "real show."

2.  **Moving Beyond "Magical Thinking":** Popular religious structures (including in Buddhism) are described as "magical thinking" or a "booster rocket"—useful for initially attracting people but something that must be "jettisoned" to reach the "outer space of noble existence." The emphasis is on practice for freedom from suffering **in this life**, not for a better future life.

3.  **The Irrelevance of Eternalism vs. Annihilationism:** The talk argues that the classic philosophical debates about eternalism (a soul that continues forever) and annihilationism (nothing after death) are ultimately distractions. Both the religious believer and the atheist can suffer equally from the "human condition" of unsatisfactoriness (*dukkha*). The Dhamma's purpose is to end suffering now, regardless of one's metaphysical beliefs.

4.  **The Root of Suffering: The Self-Preservation Instinct:** Dhammarato identifies the core mechanism of suffering as the **"self-preservation instinct."** When triggered, this instinct creates a sense of a "self" that needs protecting, leading to fear, defensiveness, and unskillful actions (from gossip to violence). The path of wisdom involves using mindfulness (*sati*) to see this instinct arise and choosing not to let it dictate thoughts and actions.

5.  **Dhamma as a Safe Harbor:** The practice is framed as finding **refuge**—a "safe harbor" from the storms of the external world and, more importantly, from the internal "tempest in a teapot" of our own reactive minds. Skillful practice is like putting up a "roadblock" on a harmful path, preventing future suffering through present-moment restraint and wise attention.

6.  **Practical Application & Kamma:** The discussion touches on practical aspects:
    *   **Kamma as Present-Moment Action:** True kamma is action whose value is seen **right now**, in the peace and lack of conflict it creates. The highest "kamma that ends kamma" is the wisdom of acting without future craving or aversion.
    *   **Freedom through Non-Desire:** If you don't want anything, you can't be manipulated or corrupted. This is true freedom.
    *   **Mindfulness of Feeling (*Vedanānupassanā*):** By being aware of feelings as they arise, you see how they might be manipulated (by media, others, or your own habits) and can choose not to be controlled by them.

7.  **Personal Anecdotes & Relating to the Teachings:** The conversation is grounded in personal stories:
    *   Dhammarato's journey from Goenka's retreats to discovering Buddhadasa's teachings in Bodh Gaya.
    *   Relating the Dhamma to family dynamics, noting how we fall into old childhood roles and how mindfulness can break that "spell."
    *   Using the suffering of previous generations (e.g., a father's fear) as motivation to "break the cycle in one generation."

### **Key Takeaways**

*   The essence of the Buddha's teaching is about ending suffering in the present moment, not adhering to cultural or religious beliefs about the afterlife.
*   The primary enemy of happiness is the reactive, self-protective mind. Freedom comes from recognizing and disarming this instinct through mindful awareness.
*   The Dhamma is a practical toolkit for navigating both internal storms and external challenges, leading to a life that is "already fine as it is," without needing to constantly seek "positive" and reject "negative."
*   The conversation champions a direct, accessible, and belief-free approach to the Dhamma, inspired by teachers like Bhikkhu Buddhadasa.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used in the talk:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The Rocket Booster / Spacecraft:**
    *   **Used by:** Speaker B (Dhammarato)
    *   **Purpose:** To explain the role of "magical thinking" (like belief in literal rebirth for merit) in early spiritual practice.
    *   **Metaphor:** Magical thinking is like the powerful first-stage rocket booster needed to launch a spacecraft (the practitioner) into the air (the Dharma). Once in flight (committed to the path), you can "jettison all of the crap" (the magical beliefs) and continue with the primary rocket (the true, supramundane teachings).

2.  **Safe Harbor / Stormy Seas:**
    *   **Used by:** Speaker B
    *   **Purpose:** To explain the concept of taking "refuge" in the Dhamma.
    *   **Metaphor:** The world and the untrained mind are like **stormy high seas**. The Dhamma is a **safe harbor** where you can find shelter. Initially, you seek refuge from external storms, but you realize you bring an internal "tempest in a teapot." The Dhamma then becomes a refuge from your own inner storms.

3.  **The Roadblock on the Highway:**
    *   **Used by:** Both speakers, introduced by Speaker A.
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate the power of wise restraint and preventing future suffering.
    *   **Metaphor:** A single wise decision (like not engaging in a harmful action) is like putting a **roadblock on a highway**. It stops a whole cascade of potential problems ("traffic") from coming down the road later.

4.  **The Get-Out-of-Hell-Free Card:**
    *   **Used by:** Speaker B
    *   **Purpose:** To critique a potential flaw in belief systems that promise forgiveness.
    *   **Metaphor:** In some religious contexts, the belief that one will be forgiven can act like a **"get out of hell free card"** (a reference to the game *Monopoly*), potentially encouraging moral complacency or bad behavior because the consequence is seen as removable.

5.  **Letting the Cat Out of the Bag:**
    *   **Used by:** Speaker B
    *   **Purpose:** To describe Ajahn Buddhadasa's direct teaching method.
    *   **Metaphor:** Teaching the profound, "supramundane" truths from the beginning, instead of hiding them, is **"letting the cat out of the bag."**

### **Stories**

1.  **The Monk Who Took the Visuddhimagga:**
    *   **Told by:** Speaker B
    *   **Purpose:** A pivotal personal story that led Speaker B to Ajahn Buddhadasa's teachings.
    *   **Story:** While reading the *Visuddhimagga* in Bodh Gaya, a Thai monk took the book from him and "half threw it" on a bed. This dramatic act was the start of the monk introducing him to the teachings of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, suggesting a more direct path than the scholarly one.

2.  **The Trial of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa:**
    *   **Told by:** Speaker B
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate the controversy and courage of Buddhadasa's teachings, and the tension between "noble" and conventional Buddhism.
    *   **Story:** In the 1930s, Buddhadasa was put on trial (*Anagami*) by the Thai Sangha, accused of being a heretic and "destroying the Sangha" for teaching that rebirth should not be taken literally. The trial involved a deep study of Pali texts. The verdict was a compromise: he was **"teaching the correct Dhamma to the wrong people"**—meaning he was right, but too public. This backfired and made him famous.

3.  **The Monk Who Disrobed to Become King:**
    *   **Told by:** Speaker B
    *   **Purpose:** To show the historical connection between the Thai nobility and enlightened monks, and the perils of worldly power.
    *   **Story:** A Thai monk (a son of King Mongkut) who was a friend of King Chulalongkorn and a supporter of Dharma reform disrobed to become a king in 1917. He died just two years later, which reminded people of the Buddha's warnings about worldly power.

4.  **The Old Monk's Hoard of Money:**
    *   **Told by:** Speaker B
    *   **Purpose:** To challenge Western perceptions about monks and money, and to illustrate non-attachment.
    *   **Story:** After an old monk died, they found his room stacked with money, mostly in small bags of 47 baht (a traditional birthday gift to monks). The scandal was that he had hoarded it, but the point was that he never used it—it was worthless to him. He had the money but no greed for it.

5.  **The Diet Starts at the Grocery Store:**
    *   **Used by:** Speaker B
    *   **Purpose:** To give a practical, everyday example of the principle of "restraint" (*samyara*).
    *   **Story:** This isn't a historical story but a relatable analogy. Practicing restraint at the point of choice (not buying junk food) is easier and more effective than trying to resist temptation constantly at home. This mirrors restraining the senses before unwholesome impressions take root.

### **Recurring Analogies & Frameworks**
*   **Eternalism vs. Annihilationism vs. Nihilism:** Used as a framework to categorize wrong views, contrasting them with the Buddha's "Middle Way."
*   **The Storm Inside (Tempest in a Teapot):** The idea that the real suffering we seek refuge from is our own internal emotional turmoil.
*   **Playing Old Family Roles:** Both speakers discuss how visiting family can make you unconsciously slip back into childhood dynamics, like actors following an "unwritten contract." Breaking this spell is seen as a Dhamma challenge and insight opportunity.

These metaphors and stories collectively serve to make abstract Buddhist concepts (like right view, refuge, restraint, and non-attachment) more tangible, memorable, and applicable to daily life.
