### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Um, all right, all right. You, you were asking about, uh, Jhana, specifically the first Jhana.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And, um, possibly the first thing to understand is, is that The first Jhana is the foundation of practice. And when one is practicing correctly, one goes into first Jhana, that that's the whole point of the practicing correctly, is to go into the first Jhana, and that the other Jhanas then are natural outcomes of the skills that we develop in the first Jhana. Okay, okay. So it's like graded music. If you can play first grade music, then you can play second grade music. If you can play second grade music, then you can play third grade music. But you have to be able to play second grade music. You can't go from playing and even being good at first grade music right into third grade music. Yeah, okay. There's one step at a time, and that, um, the correct development of the first jhana then is the foundation so that the later jhanas can be possible. But most people, if they do happen to get a first jhana, they immediately want the second jhana. In fact, they say, with the first jhana, I want the second, and on they go. Okay, it's always kind of bottom-line oriented or goal-oriented. At it, setting higher and higher goals and standards that they can't meet. And so they wind up feeling like a failure because they're wanting something they don't even understand.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** that in fact, that's one of the four imponderables. There are four imponderables, and what we mean by imponderables, these are things are not worth thinking about because you won't be able to figure it out. You can't ponder your way through some kinds of question. Okay, an example of that is, what's the beginning of everything? What's the root cause? What is creation, if you call it that? Look how many fights and arguments over the centuries has that done, and all anyone has is stories, and some of them have more math than others. Yeah, but the point is, is that it's pointless. Yeah, it doesn't matter how things got started. Here we are. Let's deal with what is. So that's one of the imponderables. The extent of the human mind is another imponderable, and we can see that in the sense of the kind of technology that we have today was undreamt about 100 years ago. Right?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, cell phones and even chips and that kind of stuff. And so who knows what's going to be next, because nobody does know, because it's actually a whole lot of people that will work on each other climbing a ladder that nobody even knows exists now. Who knows the extent of the neurocircuitry that can be done with chips. We don't know that. Okay, so let's take it back to another level. Also, people who don't have Jhana don't know what it is.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so they dream up something about what they think it is, and they take this and that piece of information from this and that person, and most of the people they learn it from don't know what Jhana is, and all they have is their ideas. And so by the time their average listener hears about Jhana, they're not going to hear about Jhana at all. They're going to hear a hodgepodge collection of various people's opinions, no one of which has actually had the Jhana. So they don't know what they're talking about. It's better to go to people who know exactly what they're talking about and get it from that perspective. Okay, so that's the first thing, is that if an imponderable, that it has to be known and experienced in order to know what it is. Yeah, but from there you can say it in the sense of it takes one to know one. Once you know what it is, you can identify it and spot it when you see it. Okay, so this is kind of what we're talking about in the sense of that Jhana, as well as the whole extent of the human mind, is another imponderable, just like the beginning, because some people can't even begin, can't even figure out what was the beginning of a conversation that they've had with someone, right? They don't— it's imponderable. They can't figure it out. In fact, the two of them will get into an argument over what happened. And so we can see that a lot of things are not ponderable. And Jhana, or the extent of the human mind, what happened in the very beginning— a third one, by the way, is the extent of Kamma, that in Asia is quite famous to look at someone who is crippled and say, oh, they must have had a very bad life their past life, they must have been really evil to be crippled in this life, you know, that you see what you already are shaking your head. I think, no, you cannot make those connections.

**Speaker B:** No,

**Speaker A:** it's too vast.

**Speaker B:** I— the, the way I think of karma is simply universal cause and effect, conditions of existence here right now, and to tie in all these ideas of like the past lives and stuff. It's like there's so much information here right now to their like present moment experience that you don't even have to like start saying like these are reasons why this is now. You're assuming a whole lot of stuff.

**Speaker A:** Exactly so. And not only that, but it's not worth our time and effort. Yeah, it's an imponderable. Accept it. That's just an imponderable, right? That's the way to go with it, rather than, oh, I need to know everything, which is the normal way that we're raised. We're raised that, oh, you get credit for what you know, and if you don't know something, you lose credit. You get your score ticked down in school if you don't know something.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so we get into the feeling of being punished because we don't know something. And so we're grasping and thirsting after knowledge, much of which is not possible, not worth knowing. If we could know it, it's not worthwhile knowing it. So a lot of wisdom is to figure out what we can figure out and not worry about the stuff that's not worth figuring out.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so now that is the foundation we can say that the actual first jhana is mentioned and talked about in the suttas in a variety of ways, including the various methods of getting into jhana and what are the factors of the jhana. And in Anapanasati, the whole sutta is designed around getting one into the first jhana, including the various factors that are necessary. Now, normally we think of that there are 5 factors of the first jhana, but both the Anapanasati Sutta implies it as well as that at least in one other sutta there are in fact 6 factors to the first jhana, and that 6th factor is relaxation of the body. Okay, so the body is relaxed, it's comfortable. Now, that means that people who are sitting in meditation and dealing with pain in their body while they're doing meditation, 100% definition-wise, they're not in first Jhana, not if the body has pain or if it has a sensation that is speaking of lack of comfort. The back hurts, the neck hurts. The knees go in sharp pain or the leg goes to sleep. Those kind of postures then are not conducive to being in the very state of mind that their sitting there is designed to get them into. So they're in a deep, deep catch-22. OK,

**Speaker B:** yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. So there's a whole lot of things that people are doing with meditation, thinking that they're going to get into first jhana when they're not. They're not going to get there because they're not practicing correctly. And relaxation of the body is definitely one of the issues. Okay, so let's look at some of the other issues, because that's the part of it that makes it important, is that we have to have all of the factors of the first jhana gathered together. That is like a system. And if you, you know, have you, you know, General Systems Theory? One of the qualities of General Systems Theory is that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Okay, okay. Which means that a feature-rich piece of software allows you to do what you need to do. The whole show, as opposed to just one little thing. So you can see the, uh, the possibility of having a car, but the car is actually in parts all over the yard. The motor's over here and the tires are over there and the steering wheel is in the tree, and you know, that kind of thing. All right, yeah, you don't have a car, you've got car parts. The car parts have to be put together and assembled in a correct way in order for it to actually be a car, because the car has function, and that is transportation. If a car has no function of transportation, it's not much of a car, is it? If your car won't start, it's not a car right then. It's a piece of junk.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, unless it's some like show car that gets, you know, just transported around. But yeah, yeah, I get that.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so, so the proof of it is that it's a whole, or it's a unified thing, or it's a system is, is that it functions correctly, right? The other idea would be a clock. The idea of going and cleaning one's clock, which means actually taking it apart, looking at the jewels, doing a little bit of polishing, putting a little bit of oil on, and putting it back in correct order and position so that the clock functions correctly. And that correctly functioning clock is the Pali word Samadhi. This is an important point because normally Western mentality has to do the transmission or the translation rather of the word Samadhi is concentration. So they think that there's some element of concentration in Jhana, which in fact, no, it's not an issue of concentration. It's a concept of gaining and gathering all the factors together so that the mind is properly functioning and unified. Concentrating.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah, a quick question on that line. Would you say maybe more than concentration, it's absorption?

**Speaker A:** Would that— that's even a worse word to use.

**Speaker B:** A worse word?

**Speaker A:** That's even a worse word to use. Why? Because when you're absorbed with something, you are not paying attention to what's going on around you. That in fact correct understanding of absorption is you desperately want out of it. Just like if you were completely absorbed in the water and in the ocean, the first thing you want is to not be absorbed with it. You want out of it. You want to at least get your head above the water, and after an hour or two, you want your body out too. Okay, right. Well, you are not looking for absorption or taking the mind and getting it stuck on something.

**Speaker B:** Okay, that's okay.

**Speaker A:** An example of that is within the Zen training, they have a thing called a Zen stick. Who gets hit with the Zen stick?

**Speaker B:** Probably the guy absorbed in something.

**Speaker A:** The one who's not paying attention to the fact that the teacher's in the room. Everybody else is going to perk up just a little bit to let him know, I know you're right behind me. And those who don't know that he's behind them because they're absorbed in something, daydreaming off in outer space in meditation, they get whacked. Wakey wakey, wake up, be here now. Don't get lost in something that you are artificially labeling as concentration when really what you're doing is just simply so focused on something you're not paying attention to what's going on. People get absorbed in books. Their house can be on fire and they can read a page or two before they recognize that they smell smoke, when they could have done that 30 seconds ago and maybe saved their house. Another example of that is taking the Zen stick into ninja training. The Zen master not just walks into the dojo where they're sitting, he walks into the dormitory when they're sleeping. Guess who gets hit with the Zen stick then?

**Speaker B:** I'm not sure.

**Speaker A:** The one who is still asleep when the Zen master comes in the room.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they're all supposed to, right?

**Speaker A:** They're supposed to wake up. Exactly. Now that we get that definition, we can understand why Western Buddhism is going off in the wrong direction, because they're actually getting absorbed into something not paying attention to what's going on, and their Zen master, their bad feelings come into their room and whack them, and they don't even know why. And when it whacks them hard enough, they call it a dark night of the soul. OK, OK. So that's the whole point, is the teaching of the Buddha has to do with the number one issue is to get the mind free from hindrances. What are the hindrances? The things that we concentrate on, the things we pay attention to, to stop that and to come into the present moment and start spending more of our time in our actual senses rather than in the sense door of the mind.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Yet another example of that is a student who calls me after he has a situation with his dad. You see, he's at home working on his computer. He's a computer scientist and he's deeply into code. And his dad comes into the room to say good night, and he didn't even wave. He just continued to type. And his dad got angry and just blew up at him, and he didn't understand why. The reason is that he was too busy typing and not paying attention. To give the Zen master his due. And so the Zen master whacked him with a stick. He began to call his dad the Zen master. Why? Because you got to pay attention to what's going on. You can't just go around absorbed in whatever you want to get absorbed in. You need to start paying attention to what's going on. Okay, so this is the very first issue about Jhana. It's not absorption. It is getting out of being absorbed and being into the present moment. Having your senses awake. Another possible way of thinking about it is be in such a state so that no one can sneak up behind you, not even a Zen master. No one can get your goat. No one can pull a fast one on you because you're awake and you're watching what's going on.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, that's a much different angle than I've heard before, but I see a lot of value in it. So what are the other 5 factors, if you want to get into that?

**Speaker A:** Or— That's exactly where we're going.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. That's the whole rest of the talk. But first, we have to understand that it is not absorbed. It is not focused. It is, in fact, being in a state of intentionally not focusing. Or another way of thinking about it is unifying things, putting them together, where concentration is in fact whacking things apart and separating them out. And Samadhi is putting things back together. One of my examples, even though it doesn't work anymore because nobody's used this stuff in years and years, and that is frozen concentrated orange juice. Have you ever heard of it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, have you ever drank frozen concentrated orange juice

**Speaker B:** without having like the water?

**Speaker A:** While it's still concentrated? Exactly.

**Speaker B:** No, I have not.

**Speaker A:** No, if you do, you don't want to do it a second and a third and a fourth time. No, you want it to be not concentrated. You want it to be Samadhi. You want it to be complete. You want to have the right ingredients in it. You want it complete and whole, not concentrated, not whacked off. Okay, so now we're understanding a little bit more about these factors. We actually have to add the water back into the dryness. You probably heard about the distinction between wet and dry meditation. Dry meditation is staying in the hindrance.

**Speaker B:** In that podcast I was talking about at the beginning with you, I remember that. And I've heard him use that term a lot, you know, like dry insight practice.

**Speaker A:** Right. Yeah, dry insight practice is one of the things that makes your practice slow and at times unbearable. The slow, hard way is to not have the mind fit for work. Yeah, let us say it in that regard then. What you want to do before you take a trip is get your car in order, get all of the tires fixed, get an oil change, tune it up, put some oil in the transmission, check your— you know where I'm coming from, you know. But that's the way that you do before you start a long journey. You get your automobile fixed up in an order. You get it, Samadhi.

**Speaker B:** And would you say maybe the oil in that situation, if we're going to transfer it to practice, would be gladdening the mind, would be one of the—

**Speaker A:** you could say that, right? And enthusiasm then would become the fuel rather than right effort. But in the beginning, we're going to put some effort into it. But then we have to put some juice in it. But the whole point is, is that many people try to take their mind out on a grand tour without having the car fit for travel. Yeah, so they have constant breakdown.

**Speaker B:** They're like, okay, now I'm gonna go meditate and go into Jhanas and stuff. But you're— yeah, it's I can see that being problematic.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So we need to gather up all the ingredients and get the car ready to go. In fact, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about this in the sense of making the mind fit for work. Now, in the description of the jhanas, we talk about this in the sense of applied and sustained thought. And what we mean by that is applying the mind onto something that's worth applying it to and sustaining the mind on that which is worth keeping sustained upon, rather than drifting off into something that's unwholesome. So we can say whatever it is that's wholesome, we're going to apply the mind to wholesome things and then sustain that. We're not going to concentrate on it. We're just simply going to not do that other thing. So this is basically back to the teaching of the Buddha about subtractive, not additive, that in all cases we keep taking things away and taking more away and taking more away. And in this case, we're taking the hindrances away. And so the applied and sustained thought is applying the mind so that there are no hindrances and sustaining the mind so that there are no hindrances. And when we can do that, one thought after another, one wholesome thought after another, after another, that means that now the mind is stable and fit for work. And that the first job, by the way, that we need to do is to keep applying the mind and keep sustaining it and keep focusing on: am I applying? Am I sustaining? Can I keep— can I stay with this? Okay, so one of the first objects that we take then is the object of the breath. Can I apply the mind so that I'm taking a long, deep breath? And can I sustain the long, deep breathing? Can I be mindful on the in-breath that it's a long breath and mindful on the out-breath that I'm taking a long out-breath? So the Anapanasati Sutta is actually the Buddha's method Buddhist teaching students how to get into the first Jhana.

**Speaker B:** And would you say that's probably one of the best, you could say, like objects to— well, a whole lot of breathing— focus that sustained thought and attention on when you're starting is just the breath.

**Speaker A:** And in the beginning, yes. And as we progress in the practice, while we maintain the mindfulness of breathing in long and breathing out long, then is when we develop the other skills. So basically, the first skill to come to is the skill in the Eightfold Noble Path of Sati, to wake up. And in that waking up process, we're going to do a very small group of things. Well, the first item on the list is to really take a look at what's going on. Like, is that a hindrance in the mind? That's the first thing that we do, because sometimes you'll wake up into a beautiful thought. The waking up and the beautiful thought often come together, which is quite marvelous. Wow. And then the other one is, is that we wake up and all there is that stuff again. Hi, Harry, I see you. Okay, so the acknowledgment of the hindrances, to seeing them, to recognize them, and then to know by recognizing them that you also have a choice over them, that you have complete choice over what kind of thoughts you're going to have. And so in this regard, we're talking about step 9 of Anapanasati, the waking up and investigating the mind, examining the mind in the sense of what contents are in there right now. And then the next one would be step 10 of Anapanasati, which is to gladden the mind, to brighten the mind, to throw that, which actually means this is a two-step process of throwing the hindrances out of the mind, is to want to see them. In this sense. Normally, when the mind is spinning around, we're just spinning with it. But Sati is the process of, aha, I see you, to wake up to it. And by doing so, we separate ourselves. We're not that thought anymore. Now we're an observer of the thought rather than lost in the thought. We're not the thought. You are not your thoughts. You are an observer of your thoughts. Can you see the distinction with that? Okay, that's step 9 of Anapanasati. And now the next one is, is that we're glad the mind. I see you. Okay, so the gladdening of the mind, along with that, is also taking the deep breath and relaxing. So the body component, the breathing is done so that the knowledge of the body, including knowledge of tension and knowledge of comfort and uncomfort, so that we can bring the body into a state of relaxation while we're bringing the mind into a state of relaxation by not having to deal with the hindrances anymore. And in fact, now Part of the way that we're beginning to talk is the end of the speech of, wow, what a relief it is. I don't have to think about that right now, or I don't have to do anything right now. Well, I can just take a break for a minute and just enjoy the moment and come into the senses and be aware of what's around us, including and especially the body and how relaxed we are and how do we feel. That in fact that's the first way of doing it is body and mind together, that in fact you cannot control the breath without controlling the mind to control the breath. You have to put Sati, you have to put a little bit of effort, or another way of saying it in our language would be pay attention. So pay attention. Actually, the payment is the right effort. And the attention is the investigation. So we're going to start paying attention to what's going on, but not in a very, very detailed, specific, going deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper into that, but paying attention to whatever is happening, whatever is happening, what's coming up in our senses, what is coming up into our field of awareness, rather than just the old stuff that we've been processing all along. Normally, that's the way that we can say that we think in past or in future, but we experience in the now. And so what we're talking about is getting into a state of experiencing through the senses what's happening in this present moment. Along with that, we begin to enjoy this present moment because all of our Dukkha comes out of the past and future. But this present moment is quite nice, especially if we talk ourselves about how nice it is. Wow, so great, I don't have to do anything with Aunt Susie right now. Aunt Susie's asleep. Boy, let her sleep. And so we can just leave things alone. And what a relief it is that I don't have to think about it, I don't have to deal with it, I don't have to get anything done. Everything is okay, everything is fine. 'Yeah, he hurt me. I don't have to retaliate. I'm okay. He didn't hurt me after all. He can't get to me,' is the kind of thoughts that we have. 'I'm above that. I'm better than that. I got this wired.' So these are the kind of thoughts that generate the right attitude. We begin to have the attitude of, 'I can handle it. I can do it. I feel safe. I feel secure. I feel satisfied. I feel comfortable.' These are actual elements of the Pali word Sukkha. Yeah, the Sukkha is exactly the opposite of the word Dukkha. So in fact, when the Buddha says his teaching is nothing but Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, he would actually could also say Dukkha, Sukkha. Get yourself out of a state of Dukkha by bringing yourself into a state of Sukkha. Come out of your dissatisfaction by intentionally becoming satisfied with what's happening. Normally, we're dissatisfied with something that we've got on our mind. But the reality of the situation of this moment, of the way that your clothing fits your skin, the way that your face feels, the way that the air is moving around you, and just this general sense of security can be found right where you are. So we begin to develop the Jhana factor of Sukkha by inviting ourselves into it, basically by talking ourselves into a state of Sukkha. Now, along with Sukkha comes then often we practice feeling really good. And in that regard, we let the body relax. And then the next item comes on is that if we practice over and over again so that we know that we can do this, then the sense of Confidence comes up. The Pali word is shraddha, and it does not mean faith. It means evidential confidence that you know that it's that way, and you keep checking it out, and every time you check it out, it keeps coming out correct. You begin to trust or know both the Dhamma as taught by the Buddha and your experience of the Dharma when you're practicing and you know that that stuff works. As you begin to know that that works, you can also gain the knowledge that no matter what happens, you can pull yourself out of the hindrances. No matter what happens, I can stop the hindrances and come back into the present moment and see the way things really are. Now, this stage is called the stage of the first knowledge on the path. The first knowledge on the path is that the student has the knowledge that no matter what, he can clean out, no matter how obstructed the hindrances are, no matter whatever he's got on his mind, no matter the dire situation he's found himself in, he can get his mind out of it. So whether you're arguing with your mother-in-law, whether you're visiting the doctor, whether you're sitting in the waiting room, when you're riding on a train, a bumpy train, whether you're getting arrested and having handcuffs and you got your face in the dirt, it doesn't matter what's going on, you can come out of it and smile and say, I can handle this, I can handle getting busted, I can handle it, I'm a champion here. This is what we begin to call the noble attitude. This attitude that we're talking about is noble. It's supermundane. It's above it all, because whatever it is can't touch me. I'm above it all. Even the cops busting me can't touch me. I cannot be bothered. I can still say, enjoy yourself, officer. I know that you guys like handcuffing people, and I will fully cooperate to make your job easy for you. Go ahead and make them as tight as you like, I can handle it. But the likelihood, if you had that attitude all along with the cops, he's probably not going to arrest you, probably not going to handcuff you. He's got no reason to handcuff you, you've already been his best friend.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, of course, of course.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, of course, that's the whole point of it, is that nothing— you're above it all, you can handle anything. Doesn't matter what comes by, you can get your mind out of it, back into a good state. Now that's a pretty high place to be at, right? That's what we mean in that particular moment. That's the state of first Jhana, the feeling like you're on top of the world, that you can see exactly what's going on. And it has that quality also of the feeling of being not superior, but at least the winner here. I'm in charge. I'm the emperor. I'm the one who can handle this, that whatever it is, I'm fully responsible for it and I'm fully capable of managing that responsibility beautifully. This state is what is referred to in the Pali. You probably heard the word called Piti. This is not absorption. This is being the feeling of being a champion on top of the world. This is the feeling of grand success, that very thing that every human craves for. And that's why some enter politics, some enter business, some go into sports. And everybody wants the feeling of being in charge and being the champion, when all it is is just a feeling that you can actually create within your own mind. That's the Piti. The feeling of being the boss, the feeling I can do this. Also the word Samma Sanghappa, which is the item on the Eightfold Noble Path, which has to do with one's right attitude. To begin to change your attitude to the attitude of a winner rather than the attitude that we were born with and maintain our whole lives, and that is the victim. The people feel a victim to their feelings, a victim to their thoughts, a victim to the rules that they have to keep, a victim of the standards they can't meet. Rather than being, you know, I can set my own rules so that I always win. And if you're thinking about it and you're thinking correctly with wisdom, of course you're going to set your own rules and standards so that you're— of course you're a champion.

**Speaker B:** I love that.

**Speaker A:** But instead, you bought into other people's rules, and now you're trying to live up to somebody else's standards and rules, and you wind up being miserable. Because you can't match up to the rules that you've adopted, instead of adopting the right rules, which are the rules that you can match, so that you do feel successful, so that you don't want anything anymore. A lot of want, a lot of desire has to do with, oh, if I get that, then that plus me can get me over the hurdle or the bar of the standards that I can't meet without it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's just not feeling enough.

**Speaker A:** So me plus the new car I call the chick magnet, the two of us can get a girl, but me alone, I can't get one. But if I got a— if I got a Mercedes, then I can get a girl. Okay, so that's the kind of thinking that we have. So we want things in order to feel good. And the Buddha is inviting, you know, take a look at— in fact, you can feel that way. All on your own. You can give yourself the wet juicy. You don't have to settle for the dry. And we invite you to do that with Anapanasati. That's the practice, the wet juicy. That's the gladdening of the mind. Add some joy. Allow yourself to be satisfied, content, got enough, everything is okay. So you have those things. You have the fearlessness, which actually is a better way, because fearlessness has to do with battles and going in and doing dangerous things stupidly. Then in fact, bravery is nothing but fear plus stupidity mixed together. Wise guys, really wise guys, don't go into battle. They try to make peace instead. And if they can't make peace, they take a hike. So this is not about bravery. This is about being— feeling secure that I can go talk to my enemy, feeling secure knowing that he's not going to attack me because I have no intention of getting into a battle with him, which is different than going into a meeting with him fearlessly thinking that it might at any moment he might try to kill me. Yeah, so we're developing the feeling of safety and security and comfort and ease and safety and satisfaction. That's the big one. When we have the satisfaction, then that's the cookie, or that's the the full-on definition of Sukkha. Why? Because dissatisfaction is the full-on definition of Dukkha. Dissatisfaction versus satisfaction. And satisfaction is one of the elements of the Eightfold Noble Path. But basically it's right there in front of us as a Jhana factor and as number 6. Step 6 of Anapanasati, that mindfully breathing in, we develop safety and security. Mindfully, as we breathe out, we have thoughts of comfort and satisfaction. Like that, mindfully breathing in, wow, I got this handled. Mindfully breathe out, oh, what a relief it is to have nothing to do and no place to go. And so we mindfully develop that skill of feeling safe and secure and comfortable, relaxed. The body gets relaxed, the mind gets relaxed, but the mind is also very alert to make sure that the mind does not go back into hindrances, because that's his playground. I mean, that's where the mind has been. This whole existence has all been, you know, getting stuck in his own pile of mud. And so we have to keep bringing the mind out. Never mind, dust yourself off and pick yourself up, dust yourself off and start again. Over and over and over again, we need to practice. And as we do, the skill of Sati begins to develop. And as we develop the skill of Sati, the skill of Piti begins to develop. As I breathe in, I feel really joyful and in charge of the world. And as I breathe out, the world is mine. What world? Right here, this world. Not that one way out there, because that world way out there is just a concept, and I don't have to deal with concepts. We could deal with the reality of right here, right now. I'm the king. I mean, I've got this chair nailed down to the ground. It will not move because I'm sitting on it. I mean, this is the kind of thoughts that we have, that we've got it. Our life is wonderful right now. As I breathe in, I feel really good and champion and fine. And as I breathe out, oh, what a marvelous place this is. And so we start having these very wholesome, high-class, noble thoughts, and we begin to feel that way. Piti and Sukkha, free from hindrances, with a mind that's applied to the wholesome, sustains the wholesome, and the body is relaxed. So those are the factors of the first Jhana, the six factors. Number one, freedom from the hindrances. Number two, let's juicy this thing up, let's gladden the mind. Number three, let's start breathing more naturally rather than breathing normally. Everybody normally breathes in a very shallow, conservative way. Here we're going to be inviting the joy of living, life itself, that the breath is life-giving. So begin to enjoy that we're taking in all of this life and we're breathing out. And as we breathe out, we throw out a bunch of garbage. So as we breathe out, we can also throw out a bunch of mental garbage and take in some new, fresh reality. And as we breathe out, we throw out old mental garbage. And as we breathe in, we breathe in joy. As I breathe out, I relax. And so we practice this over and over again and get the mind into that relaxed, sharp frame of mind. This is the first Jhana where the mind is really fit for work and can see what's going on because we're having far more mind moments in reality and very few mind moments stuck in the past to the future. Even the talking that we're doing is a blow-by-blow description of what's actually happening in reality right now, rather than, oh, you should do this, or I've got to go do that. So a lot of it has to do— oh, never mind, never mind that stuff. Back to being happy. Over and over and over again, we practice that. It has to be quite repetitive because you have been practicing repeating being in hindrances. You have practicing being in a state of talking yourself into feeling bad So now we have to practice over and over and over again to start to develop this as a skill, to be able to easily talk ourselves into this state of happiness and joy and satisfaction, contentment, fearlessness, or safety and security. You know, it's really just nice. And you need to practice getting into that state over and over again and then practice maintaining it over and over again. So when the mind is truly fit for work, now we can put it to the work of noting. And there's a whole lot of stuff that we can note once the mind is fit for work. But also in the process of getting it fit for work, we're developing the Jhana factors, which what we mean is what is the mind fit for work to do is to develop and maintain the Jhana factors. How is my Sati? How is my investigation? How is my joy? How is my fearlessness? How is my comfort? How is my relaxation? How is my ability to focus or in the sense of apply the mind? How is my ability to sustain? Can I keep sustaining? Can I keep sustaining? So basically, the Jhana factors themselves wind up being the objects that are worthy of investigation, because they're all wholesome, as opposed to observing, noting, and watching unwholesome things, which is what dry insight meditation does. They just note whatever's there. Here we're going to have everything spick and span and clean so that when we do a mental inspection, we win completely. The old butler cannot take his white glove and wipe anywhere and find any speck of dust. And so we invite him to come take a look.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, this is, uh, showing a lot of light on the first Jhana. I did I definitely haven't heard this level of depth on it in this way before.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's all right there in the suttas.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Is there a sutta that you would recommend to someone to read first if they haven't read a full sutta before? I mean, the closest thing I've listened to the Diamond Sutra a number of times, but what would be a good beginner sutta in your opinion?

**Speaker A:** I would say for the beginner to recognize, and I do I'm laughing because this was hard for me. Sometimes I used to think that I can find what I'm looking for in the sutras, like there's one sutra that's going to give it all right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And that's not true in the sense that the sutras were always given as threads or as a thread of conversation, just like you and I are having a thread of conversations about it now. But in that regard, I pulled stuff from a whole lot of different suttas. So I can say this, that without going too deeply into it, there is one sutta, number 119, which is the Anupassana Sutta on the body, where it does discuss the first Jhana, including stories about it. So you could take that little passage out of sutta number 119 and then superimpose it on top of the Anapanasati Anapanasati Sutta to say, oh yeah, that's right, the Anapanasati Sutta fits exactly what we're doing here in this theoretical definition with examples of it in 119. And then we can go to which— so that's 119 and 118. And then we go to 117 to see where the Eightfold Noble Path is what ties all of this stuff together.

**Speaker B:** So start 119, then 118 with the knowledge of 119, and then 117 with the knowledge of— Right.

**Speaker A:** And if you can get those 3 suttas down so that you can see the interrelationship between the 2 of them, or the 3 of them, then we can begin to add other suttas to that to begin piling on. But I have drawn stuff out of Sutra Number 48, Number 2, Number 24, Number 39, Number 117, 118, and 119 just today in our talk. I've covered all of the bits and pieces of all of those suttas.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I can't imagine

**Speaker A:** what,

**Speaker B:** what understanding you have from the suttas of all this stuff that I lack right now. It's got to be a lot.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's, that's so I can point you in the direction, but the, um, uh, the pointing you in the right direction is only half the job. I've also got to kick you in the ass to get you started.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So it's both one and two. I gotta point you in the right direction and then kick you off to get you started. And we have to do both of them over and over and over and over and over again as you move down the path.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And so what are your thoughts on the idea of transmission?

**Speaker A:** That's what we're doing right now.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's why I was asking, because I actually feel quite a difference. That's why.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that is the art of transmission, the art of kindling a spark and then blowing it in your direction to light your fire. And that fire is basically the attitude of, I can do this, I can do that, I can change my way of living, I can feel the way I want to, I can change. That's what my deal is. That's what I'm trying to give you is I can change mentality. You can. You can develop the skills you need.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I would say that's probably been the most consistent thing that I've gained from talking with you the times that we have, or the time that I was in one of the Sangha meetings. You're really good at that, generating that feeling of being able to do it. I think that's something that is missing from a lot of teachings that I've gone through. And it definitely helped me a lot when I first talked with you afterwards. I noticed some really big changes

**Speaker A:** with

**Speaker B:** that attitude, you know.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, now that you know about the details and the forms of the first Jhana, now we have to practice how to get into it. Because actually, when you understand the first Jhana, then you already know how to get into it. We've been talking about how do you get into the first Jhana? The answer to that is we have to wake up and we have to then pay attention to what's going on, gladden the mind, deepen the breath, and repeat. Basically, we rinse the mind and repeat. That's all there is to it. Rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat, over and over and over again. You probably heard that. That's on the back of shampoo bottles. Yeah, so we keep working on it over and over again, keep cleaning the mind, keep throwing unwholesome thoughts out, and pretty soon you get very good at figuring out what is wholesome and what's an unwholesome thought. You begin to do an investigation that's determinative. You're questioning, is this thought worth having or not? Or is it actually hindering me from feeling the way that I could feel if I let myself feel the way I want to feel, rather than feeling the way that this thought makes me feel? And so you begin to change the thoughts, and the higher quality of the thoughts you have, the better you feel.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's very true.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it is, isn't it? That we do condition ourselves to feel with our thinking. So if you're thinking about hurting someone, anger is not far away. But if you have the thoughts, oh, he didn't hurt me, he didn't touch me, I'm beyond that, he can't touch me, I'm okay— you probably heard it in the expression of the best revenge is living well. Which means whatever he did to me, whatever he did to me didn't touch me. I'm still living fine. He can't get to me. He can call me anything he wants or take any product I own, and he can't hurt me. So if you feel above it all and you just can't— he just— I mean, they can't do anything to hurt you. You're, you're good enough to you're above all of that. That's a whole lot better position to take than, oh no, poor me, he took my Wadidah, or whatever. You can't smirch my reputation, I don't even have one.

**Speaker B:** What'd you say? It disconnected for a second there.

**Speaker A:** I, I made the joke, you can't smirch my reputation because I don't even have one. So this is the kind of attitude that we're talking about, that we develop that attitude. The Buddha was known as a lion. This is what we're talking about, is the lion's attitude, the attitude of I can handle this, which is basically wrapped up in that Piti, Sukkha. You can't do anything to make me feel bad, only I can do that. And I'm certainly not going to use what he said as an instrument to make me feel bad. Why? Just because he tried to stab me in the back, should I pull that dagger out and start stabbing myself with it? That's what we do. So this is the way that we do it. We remove those hindrances, we remove those knives and the slings and the arrows of outrageous fortune. Throw them out of the mind. They're not there. They can't touch me.

**Speaker B:** I think you're transmitting a bit to my cat too. He seems to be more relaxed and out than he's been in a while.

**Speaker A:** Well, maybe he's getting it third hand through you.

**Speaker B:** And he's just— yeah, he's He, I guess he's, he's got the relaxation of

**Speaker A:** the, the— he's the lion at the

**Speaker B:** top of the food chain.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, he's the lion in the room. Yeah, yeah, become a cat, become above it all. You're better than those humans. They'll go around thinking about things and then feeling bad, and we don't have to think about anything and we don't have to feel bad. So your cat's in First Jhana most of the time.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, this feels nice.

**Speaker A:** Okay, Brandon, well, I think that this is a good time to end. I think that this is a good discussion we've had. Thanks for asking.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the time went quick. I thought to myself, you know, Dhammarato talks a lot about the first Jhana, and a lot of people come in with all these high-end questions. They want to be at the end. I was like, maybe the best thing to actually move forward would be to try to focus on the most fundamental thing as I can.

**Speaker A:** Well, as you can tell, I've had some time to do this over and over again. There's probably 4 or 5 videos in the past several years that talk about this.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I might, I might go back. Well, do you think it's worth it to watch those after I've had the discussion with you, or— up to you.

**Speaker A:** It's all entertainment. Just enjoy the show. You might pick up an extra tidbit or two.

**Speaker B:** I think I'm definitely gonna check out 119, then 118, then 117. That sounds like a good plan from what you said.

**Speaker A:** Have to remember that that's in the Majjhimanakaya.

**Speaker B:** Majjhimanakaya, if I said it right.

**Speaker A:** Right, the Middle Link Sayings. Well, all right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, thank you for everything today. It was great. I really enjoyed it.

**Speaker A:** Me too. Yeah, this is— I get a real kick out of the Dhamma. I mean, I could be in my bedroom pouting right now. Yes, I'm still here.

**Speaker B:** Hey, when you said— you said, me too, I really enjoy it, and then it cut out. What did you say?

**Speaker A:** Oh, I said, yeah, if we weren't talking together right now, I'd probably be in my bedroom pouting or something.

**Speaker B:** Oh really? I don't believe that.

**Speaker A:** No, I'm joking.

**Speaker B:** I don't believe that for a second.

**Speaker A:** Alrighty, well, we'll see you, and see your cat too. Okay, Brandon, see him again. All right, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) in dialogue with a Sangha friend (Speaker B), provides a detailed, practical, and often unconventional guide to understanding and entering the **first jhāna**. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Thesis: First Jhāna is the Foundation**
*   The first jhāna is not an advanced goal but the **essential foundation** of correct practice. Mastering it makes the higher jhānas a natural progression, like mastering grades of music.
*   A common mistake is to rush toward higher jhānas without solidifying the first, leading to frustration and a sense of failure.

### **Key Misconceptions Corrected**
1.  **It's Not About Concentration or Absorption:** The common translations of *samādhi* as "concentration" or jhāna as "absorption" are misleading and harmful.
    *   **Samādhi** means **unification** or making the mind "fit for work"—like assembling a functional car from parts or tuning a clock.
    *   **Absorption** implies being lost in an object, which is the opposite of the goal. True practice is about **waking up** to the present moment, being alert to all senses (like a student aware of a Zen master with a stick), and not getting lost in thought.

2.  **It's Not Dry or Forced:** "Dry insight" practice, which tries to observe whatever arises (including hindrances) without cultivating joy, is the slow, hard path. The Buddha's path is the **"wet, juicy" way** of actively gladdening the mind.

### **The Six Factors of the First Jhāna**
The talk emphasizes **six factors** (not just the traditional five), all of which must be present together as a unified system:
1.  **Freedom from the Five Hindrances:** The mind is free from sensual desire, ill-will, sloth, restlessness, and doubt.
2.  **Applied Thought (*Vitakka*):** Applying the mind to wholesome objects (like the breath).
3.  **Sustained Thought (*Vicāra*):** Keeping the mind steadily on those wholesome objects.
4.  **Joy/Rapture (*Pīti*):** The thrill of success, the feeling of being a **champion**, in charge, and fearless. This is the "juice."
5.  **Happiness/Contentment (*Sukha*):** The deep contentment and satisfaction of being free from hindrances. *Sukha* is the direct antidote to *dukkha* (unsatisfactoriness).
6.  **Relaxation of the Body:** **Crucially, if there is physical pain or discomfort, you are not in the first jhāna.** The body must be comfortable and relaxed.

### **Practical Method: How to Enter First Jhāna**
The method is framed through **Ānāpānasati (Mindfulness of Breathing)** and the **Eightfold Path**:
*   **Start with Sati (Mindfulness):** "Wake up" and notice what's in the mind. Recognize hindrances as they arise.
*   **Gladden the Mind (Step 10 of Ānāpānasati):** Actively cultivate joy. Talk to yourself in a way that generates feelings of safety, security, and success (e.g., "I can handle this," "What a relief").
*   **Work with the Breath:** Breathe deeply and naturally. Use the breath to relax the body and refresh the mind. Breathe in joy, breathe out mental garbage.
*   **Cultivate the Right Attitude (*Sammā Saṅkappa*):** Shift from a **victim mentality** to a **noble, champion mentality**. You are not your thoughts; you are the observer who can choose wholesome ones. Set your own internal rules so you can "win" and feel satisfied.
*   **Rinse and Repeat:** The practice is **repetitively letting go** of unwholesome thoughts and **repetitively inviting** wholesome, joyful, and contented states. It's subtractive, not additive.

### **The Result: A Mind Fit for Work**
When these factors are unified, the mind is in **first jhāna**—**relaxed, alert, joyful, content, and supremely capable**. It is "fit for work," meaning it can then be used for true insight (*vipassanā*) by examining these wholesome states themselves. This state is characterized by **evidential confidence (*saddhā*)**—the knowledge that you can always return to this peaceful, unshakable core, no matter what life throws at you.

### **Additional Important Themes**
*   **Imponderables:** Don't waste time pondering unanswerable questions (e.g., the origin of the universe, precise workings of kamma). Focus on what you can know and change: your present-moment experience.
*   **Transmission:** True Dhamma teaching is the "art of transmission"—kindling the spark of confidence in the student that **change is possible** and they have the ability to do it.
*   **Sutta References:** The talk synthesizes teachings from several suttas, primarily **MN 119 (Kāyagatāsati)**, **MN 118 (Ānāpānasati)**, and **MN 117 (Mahācattārīsaka)**. The speaker recommends studying these to see the integrated framework.

In essence, the talk re-frames the first jhāna not as a trance state, but as the **practical, achievable, and joyful art of mastering your own mind and attitude**, creating a foundation of unshakable well-being from which all deeper understanding grows.

### Metaphors and Stories

The speaker uses a rich tapestry of **metaphors** and **stories** to explain the nature of the first jhāna and common misunderstandings about meditation. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **Graded Music:** The progression through the jhānas is compared to learning music grades. You must master first grade before moving to second, and so on. You can't skip steps.
2.  **Car Assembly & Maintenance:**
    *   **Car Parts vs. Functional Car:** The factors of the first jhāna are like car parts. Having the parts scattered in a yard isn't a car; they must be assembled correctly to create a functioning whole (the jhāna). This illustrates "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts" (General Systems Theory).
    *   **Tuning Up for a Journey:** Before a long trip, you tune up your car (oil change, tires, etc.). Similarly, you must make the mind "fit for work" through jhāna before undertaking the deeper journey of insight.
3.  **Clock Repair:** Samādhi (often mistranslated as "concentration") is likened to a correctly functioning clock. It's not about focusing on one thing, but about cleaning, polishing, and assembling all parts so the entire system works in unified harmony.
4.  **Frozen Orange Juice Concentrate:** Concentration is like the thick, unpalatable syrup. Samādhi is the complete, balanced, and enjoyable drink after you add water. True practice is about "adding the water back"—making things whole and integrated, not intense and narrow.
5.  **The Lion:** The attitude of the first jhāna is compared to a lion—fearless, "on top of the food chain," unassailable, and in a natural state of noble confidence. It's the opposite of a victim mentality.
6.  **Rinse and Repeat:** The practice of entering the first jhāna is compared to the instructions on a shampoo bottle: you cleanse the mind of hindrances and repeat the process continuously.
7.  **The Butler's White Glove:** A mind in proper jhāna is so clean and "spick and span" that even a butler doing a white-glove inspection couldn't find a speck of dust (unwholesome thought).

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **The Zen Stick:** Used in multiple scenarios to critique the Western misconception of meditation as "absorption."
    *   In the meditation hall, the student who is daydreaming (absorbed) gets whacked to be brought back to the present.
    *   In the ninja dormitory, the sleeping student who doesn't wake up when the master enters gets whacked. True awareness means being alert to your entire environment.
2.  **The Programmer and His Dad:** A student, deeply absorbed in coding, ignores his father saying goodnight. The father's angry outburst is the "Zen stick." The story teaches that true practice is about being present and attentive to life, not lost in thought.
3.  **The Cop and Handcuffs:** The speaker describes how with the jhānic attitude of fearless security, even being arrested couldn't disturb you. You'd be so cooperative and unperturbed that the officer likely wouldn't feel the need to use force. The point is that external events "can't touch" the inner state of safety and sovereignty.
4.  **The Cat:** In a spontaneous moment, the listener's cat becomes part of the teaching. The relaxed, content, "above-it-all" cat is humorously presented as a natural example of being in a jhāna-like state—comfortable, secure, and not lost in thought.

### **Key Conceptual Contrasts Built Through Metaphor**
*   **Concentration/Absorption vs. Unified Wholeness (Samādhi):** The talk relentlessly argues against seeing jhāna as intense focus (the car parts, the clock, the orange juice, the Zen stick stories).
*   **Dry vs. Wet Practice:** "Dry insight" is struggling without the joyful, lubricating factors of jhāna. "Wet" practice is "gladdening the mind," adding the "oil" of joy and satisfaction to make the path smooth and pleasant.
*   **Victim vs. Champion/Noble/Lion:** Most people live with a victim mentality to their thoughts and circumstances. The first jhāna cultivates the attitude of a champion, a noble, a lion—someone who is in charge, secure, and cannot be harmed by external events.
*   **Pondering the Imponderable vs. Practical Work:** The "four imponderables" (like the beginning of the universe or precise karmic results) are stories used to illustrate the folly of intellectual grasping. Wisdom lies in focusing on what can be known and changed—the present-moment mind.

These metaphors and stories work together to demystify the first jhāna, framing it not as a trance state, but as a **practical, accessible, and joyful skill of unifying the mind, letting go of hindrances, and cultivating a noble and unshakable attitude in the present moment.**
