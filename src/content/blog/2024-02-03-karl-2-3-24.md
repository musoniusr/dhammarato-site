### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, as soon as you turn on the camera, your image disappears from me, but that's fine as long as—.

**Speaker B:** Alright, normally that comes by turning the camera off and turning it back on.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, it's back. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Alright, great.

**Speaker B:** Okay. So you're asking about leaving Tainan and going back to London, and about And you're saying what, that you can't think of anything to talk about but the Dharma? And so you're asking about being a Dhamma teacher.

**Speaker A:** I don't want to be a Dhamma teacher, but it seems to be like the only thing that there is to do. There's nothing else really worth doing other than food and shelter, right?

**Speaker B:** The first thing then is to think of is to take the word teacher and all of the bad and double meanings and all of that has to do and substitute the word talk. So you can just talk about Dharma. Or another word that you can use instead of teacher is smile. You can just smile the Dharma. You don't have to teach the Dharma. That in fact, that point about smiling is a major part of it. You know, all the Buddha statues have the Buddha with a smile, a slight grin. Some call it the cat-eating-the-bird grin. Okay? And that's basically what it is, except that the bird that we've got a hold of, that we've swallowed, is reality. And reality is actually quite tasty. And so that gives us a grin. All right, so that's the way to spread the Dhamma, is by talking about it and by smiling about it. But if you start teaching it, you're going to sound like a door-to-door salesman and get a bad rap. Something like, there's a group in the US called the Jehovah's Witness. And they've got a really bad rap. Why? Because they insist on proselytizing and on teaching the Dharma, and you don't have to do that. Basically, the easy way to do it, the way that I would do it, the way that it's practiced generally in all of Buddhism, is you wait until they ask questions and then you answer their questions in Dhamma. That way, you're off the hook. And that was what I would suggest. And the way to get them to ask questions is with having that bird-eating grin on your face. Because people are not used to people being happy. That in fact I've heard many students who talk about the people that they knew before they started practicing Dharma would come up and say, "You have changed," indicating really changed for the better. And so this is the way that we want to approach it. We want to look at it from that perspective. That you're actually not just talking the Dharma or teaching it, you're living it with a smile.

**Speaker A:** What I find is this thing of when we sat down on the porch and we talked about the retreat and how the Dharma was being taught in the retreat, I found it that there is a lack of joy And a lot of like teachings do lack that of joy because they don't really know how to almost portray it in a more digestible way for people that you can see this joy in their everyday life. It's actually happening, but they're just not being really aware of it.

**Speaker B:** Right. That's an important point, you see, is that a lot of Buddhist, especially Western Buddhist, They're not satisfied with what they are and what they have to the point of smiling about it. They're still wanting something, and so they're wanting something out of the meditation, as opposed to the meditation actually being sitting down and cultivating joy, practicing, developing the skill. Thus one trains oneself, is what it said in the Suttas. About gladdening the mind, brightening the mind, putting a smile on it. And then you know that there's a lot of research also about facial muscles and neurolinguistics and all of that kind of stuff, neurology, that says that it works both directions. If you put a smile on your face intentionally, it'll put a smile on your mind. And if you've got a smile on your mind, it'll put a smile on your face. It works in both directions like that. The muscles are kind of funny that way, they work together. And so just by remembering to smile and smiling when you're out in public, that puts a smile on your mind also. And the whole trick is to remember to do that, to remember to take that frown and turn it upside down. That's what's hard to remember.

**Speaker A:** But that also puts like a— that smile already puts like a center of attention on you as you even walk into the room. As we talked about Ajahn Paul walking into the room, or even being around you, there's a precise center of attention that people are drawn to, which is uncomfortable at the same time to continue smiling. You want to almost put yourself down into the level of others, isn't it?

**Speaker B:** Well, yes, that's true, because misery loves company. And when you have a whole lot of ordinary people that are having ordinary mental states, They don't much like it when someone walks in with a great big grin. They don't like that so much. Why? Well, partly because you don't fit into their misery. You won't join their pity party. That's the whole point. And when they can get over that, then they'll want to join your happy party. But the initial reaction is, is they don't like it so much. But they'll get over that. You have to have— you've heard the expression, a teaspoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down, right? Well, that's what we're doing, except in some cases a teaspoon is not enough. We need a shovelful. Or maybe a backhoe scooper full. And in some cases, even one of these mining buckets that take about, what, 60 tons or something in its jaws and then spits that out. That's the kind of joy that we need for some people, because they really don't like it when you're happy. But that's living the Dhamma. Can you continue to smile even when people don't like it, when you're smiling.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Q] Well, that comes from just having no more doubts really about all of it.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:D] That's right, no more doubts about the Dharma. I know enough that I can get away with anything by smiling. And what do I mean by getting away with anything? Getting along with people who don't smile. And so that's the place to start. And then the next point is, he said, sure, it's okay to talk about the Dharma, but you can use the smiling as, can you remember to smile? And then we're starting to talk about Sati, but you don't have to say that you're— the Pali word Sati. You can just tell them you can remember to smile, you can remember that today is not as bad as you think it is.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's precisely what I see myself doing more and more is I'm not really interested in discussing more about Noble One. I'm more interested in making them see that they have these moments when they do ask or when they do write about it. I'm making it more adjustable to their life because they want to see it. If they want to see it, if it's not something they can relate. Like, if they're not engineers, they're not going to understand engineering. So that's what I see as teaching. It's not really teaching, it's more like relating.

**Speaker B:** You say. Exactly so. But that's exactly what the Dhamma is, is learning to relate with the Dhamma. Or another way to say it is learning to relate with reality, because that's why people get so miserable. Such a pity party, is because they don't want to relate with reality, they want reality to conform to their ideas, and it's not going to do that. And so, by seeing reality as just fine, then we can smile, because we know that. You've got a secret. And the secret is: reality is good enough. And we don't need a lot of plans to fix reality. Only a few will do. So this is my hint. This is the way that I would expect anybody to learn to teach the Dharma, is starting this way. Starting to help people to remember that they've got a choice. About smiling or not smiling. You don't have to bring in Buddha or the Eightfold Noble Path or the Four Noble Truths, not in the first 10 minutes anyway.

**Speaker A:** Well, it happens really naturally. You know that there is no way getting through that thickness initially anyway, so it happens naturally, you're just smiling, and the questions come from time to time, right?

**Speaker B:** And you know that some people are going to be downright resistant to hearing anything that's outside their system. So a Christian's not going to like you talking about Buddhism, but a Christian can smile. Smiles are not illegal in Christianity. Learning to remember to smile, learning to remember that everything is real. I mean, they talk about their religion as if a whole lot of magical creatures are out there someplace. And so in general, Christianity lives in a non-reality to begin with. And so it's really easy in that delusion to fall into misery. Their teaching is that you already are broken, you already deserve hell, and that's where you're going to go when you die. And the idea then is that, well, whatever is real is better than whatever we make up. And smiling, like I said, is not illegal anywhere that I know of. And so that's what you can teach. You don't have to use the word Buddha or anything. Just smile, darn you, smile. That's all we need to do. And when people start asking questions about why are you so cheerful, you can say, because I practice being cheerful. I remember to be cheerful. If I didn't practice and remember to be cheerful, I'd be as miserable as you are. Hint, hint. So is that Is that good enough? Is that enough for you to get started?

**Speaker A:** Oh, I already have started a long time ago. It's just something that I see more unfolding naturally as you're just smiling, as you said, it just happens. It's nothing I can really do about it, other than smile, smile through it, isn't it so?

**Speaker B:** Yes, in fact I encourage my friends, to stop seeing me as a teacher and to just see me as a friend who talks about the Dharma.

**Speaker A:** That's one of the things I also seen lately, that there is no teacher really, and we do just talk about Dharma. I can envision you as some kind of spiritual teacher or whatever, but in the end it really stick when you said the only way to give back to Dharma is by Like the only way to give back to the teacher is by continuing the Dharma. It's just by continuing to Buddha, to you, to whoever teaches it. Like it's the only way of actually feeling like this gratefulness and giving back. It's the only way. It's by you starting to being joyful and then it rubs off on others. That's the whole effect.

**Speaker B:** That's all there is to it. Makes it really easy that way. Is to remember to smile.

**Speaker A:** Well, I'm really glad I called you again to catch you just one last time before we go to the different time zones.

**Speaker B:** All right. Well, we'll see you again on the internet. Once you get back to London, you can tell me how it's going.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely.

**Speaker B:** All right, Carl. Thank you, Dhammarato. We'll see you later. Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key themes and advice shared by Dhammarato (Speaker B) in response to a practitioner's (Speaker A) questions about sharing the Dhamma:

**Core Theme:** Sharing the Dhamma is not about formal "teaching," but about **living and embodying it with joy**, primarily through a genuine smile.

**Key Points:**

1.  **Replace "Teacher" with "Talk" or "Smile":** Avoid the identity and pressure of being a "Dhamma teacher." Instead, simply **talk about the Dhamma** when asked, and, more importantly, **"smile the Dhamma."** The serene smile of Buddha statues is presented as the model—a grin that comes from having "swallowed" and accepted reality, finding it "quite tasty."

2.  **The Method: Wait, Then Answer:** The most effective and graceful way to share is to **wait until people ask questions** based on observing your demeanor. Your joyful disposition becomes the invitation. This avoids the pitfalls of proselytizing.

3.  **Cultivate and Remember Joy:** A central problem identified is that many practitioners approach meditation and Dhamma from a place of **wanting and dissatisfaction**, rather than as a direct **cultivation of joy and gladdening the mind**. The practice is to actively develop this skill.

4.  **The Smile is a Practice & a Tool:** Smiling is a two-way street between mind and body. Intentionally **putting a smile on your face can cultivate a smile in the mind**, and vice-versa. The essential practice is to **remember to smile**, especially when it's difficult.

5.  **Dealing with Resistance:** Smiling in a group often accustomed to complaint ("misery loves company") can draw attention and discomfort. The practice is to **continue smiling anyway**, offering a "teaspoonful of sugar"—or sometimes a "shovelful" of joy—to help the "medicine" of reality go down for others.

6.  **Relating, Not Preaching:** Sharing Dhamma effectively means **relating it to people's immediate lives and reality**, not discussing abstract doctrines. The core "secret" to share is that **reality is good enough** as it is, and we don't need elaborate plans to fix it. This understanding naturally leads to joy.

7.  **Universality of a Smile:** This approach transcends religious labels. You don't need to mention Buddhism; you can simply talk about **remembering to smile and be cheerful** as a practice. This is accessible to anyone, anywhere.

8.  **The True Relationship:** The ideal dynamic is not teacher-student, but **friends talking about Dhamma**. The ultimate way to express gratitude for the teaching is to **continue the Dhamma by embodying joy**, allowing it to naturally "rub off on others."

**Conclusion:** Dhammarato's advice distills the path of sharing Dhamma into a simple, profound practice: **Remember to smile.** This smile is both the fruit of accepting reality and the method for inviting others to inquire about the well-being it represents. The transmission happens through joyful living and responsive conversation, not through formal instruction.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the dialogue, the primary metaphors and stories used are:

**1. The "Cat-Eating-the-Bird" Grin (Smile of the Buddha)**
*   **Metaphor:** The slight smile on Buddha statues is compared to a cat that has caught and eaten a bird.
*   **Meaning:** The "bird" is **reality**. Having "swallowed" and accepted reality, finding it "quite tasty," leads to a genuine, contented smile. This smile becomes the primary way to express and share the Dharma.

**2. Spreading Dharma as Smiling, Not Teaching**
*   **Metaphor:** The roles of "teacher" and "teaching" are substituted with **"talk"** and **"smile."**
*   **Meaning:** One doesn't proselytize or "sell" the Dharma like a door-to-door salesman. Instead, one **lives it with a smile**, which naturally attracts questions. This approach is contrasted with the negative stereotype of groups like **Jehovah's Witnesses**, who are used as a cautionary example of forceful teaching.

**3. The Bidirectional Smile (Neurological Loop)**
*   **Metaphor/Concept:** The connection between facial expression and mental state is described as a two-way street, supported by neurology.
*   **Meaning:** Intentionally **putting a smile on your face** can "put a smile on your mind," and vice-versa. The "trick" is to remember to "take that frown and turn it upside down."

**4. Misery Loves Company / The Pity Party vs. The Happy Party**
*   **Metaphor:** Social dynamics are framed as parties.
*   **Meaning:** Unhappy people are in a **"pity party"** and may resent someone who smiles because they "won't join their misery." The goal is for them to eventually want to join your **"happy party."**

**5. Sugar Helps the Medicine Go Down (Escalated Version)**
*   **Story/Metaphor:** The common saying is escalated to humorous extremes.
*   **Meaning:** For some resistant people, a simple smile (a "teaspoonful of sugar") isn't enough to make the "medicine" (the joyful reality you embody) palatable. You might need a **"shovelful," a "backhoe scooper full," or even a giant mining bucket** of joy to overcome their resistance. The point is to maintain your smile even when it irritates others.

**6. The Secret of Reality**
*   **Metaphor:** Understanding the Dharma is having a **"secret."**
*   **Meaning:** The secret is that **"reality is good enough."** People are miserable because they fight reality; happiness comes from accepting it. Sharing the Dharma is helping people discover this secret, often starting simply with the choice to smile.

**7. Christianity as Living in a "Non-Reality"**
*   **Metaphor/Concept:** A specific religious worldview is described as a state of **"delusion"** based on "magical creatures" and the idea that humans are inherently broken.
*   **Meaning:** This is used to contrast the Dharma's focus on relating to present reality. The speaker argues that smiling—a simple, real action—is a universal and non-threatening entry point, even for those entrenched in such belief systems.

**8. Giving Back by Continuing the Dharma**
*   **Metaphor:** The transmission of Dharma is framed as a **chain of gratitude and influence.**
*   **Meaning:** The true way to repay a teacher or the Dharma itself is not through formal teaching, but by **"continuing" it**—by living joyfully so that it **"rubs off on others."** This is the "whole effect."

In summary, the talk uses metaphors centered on **smiling as the embodiment and transmission of Dharma**, contrasts between **joyful acceptance and miserable resistance**, and **humorous escalations** to emphasize the power of persistent, joyful presence.
