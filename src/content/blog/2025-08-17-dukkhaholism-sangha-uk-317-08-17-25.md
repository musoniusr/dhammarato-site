### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Well, hello friends. Today is Sunday afternoon. Let's see, it's, um, what, August 17th? Wow, time flies when you're having fun. And it's, uh, 4 o'clock in the afternoon. For, uh, UK, it's, uh, uh, morning, Sunday morning. So you can think of this as Sunday morning, uh, frivolity service, not worshiping. Unless you spell it with a W-A-R-S-H-I-P. So one of the questions that was asked today shouldn't take very long, and that is the story of Samsara. Now, actually, Samsara is kind of like a wheel in the sense that things go around and keep going around and keep going around. But they don't always go around the same, as you'll see my hand. Think of it kind of as a spiral. A real good example is the planet Earth. When it turns exactly 360 degrees around, how long does that take? Anybody got a guess? Yes, Dietrich, go ahead. How long does it take for the Earth to go around 365 degrees, one full circle?

**Speaker B:** 24 hours.

**Speaker A:** Huh?

**Speaker B:** 24 hours?

**Speaker A:** No, no, it takes 23 hours and 54 minutes. Ah, why is that? Because while the Earth is turning— it's also moving. So it takes another 4 minutes for the Sun to line up the way that it was yesterday because the Earth is not, let us say, just turning around. It's also in a spiral around the Sun. Now the reason that I'm mentioning that, a little bit of physics for you, is that Samsara is like that also. It's not a wheel. In other words, when you go around a full circle around, you're not where you were the last time you went around. Things have changed. But they have the idea that everything is in cycles. An example of that would then be that all forms of government, no matter what names they have, All forms of government are oligarchy. In other words, the wealthy, regardless of what kind of government you call it— can be a communist, can be a socialist, can be a democracy, whatever you want to name that form of government— it's always run by the very wealthy. Isn't that interesting, Alex? Oh yeah, oh yeah, what can you expect? All right, so the idea of the, uh, Samsara is, is that it is what goes around comes around, but it never comes around the way you expect it to come around. That in fact, the Buddha has the Four Imponderables as you do not know the results of actions. You just don't know what you're going to do. For instance, when you buy stock, you don't know whether it's going to go up or down. It'll probably do some of both and wind up being just where it was for a while. So you don't know the outcome of what you're doing. That's also true with human relations. In fact, that's the same thing as on this call. We don't know what people are going to get out of it. All we can do is be mindful of what's happening right now rather than the expectations of when things come around again, what's it going to be like, because we don't know. So this whole idea of Samsara is not what people mostly think. They think of Samsara as a wheel to where once it goes around 360 degrees The wheel is still exactly where it was before. Except that, what if the wheel is on a cart and the cart is going at 10 miles an hour? Then by the time the wheel rolls around, it's not in the same place it used to be. Everything keeps changing, everything keeps moving. And for that reason, the whole concept of Samsara within the context of the teaching of the Buddha is kind of irrelevant. The Samsara in fact is more of a Hindu concept, or we can place it in the regard, as we've talked several times, of it's part of Buddhism, but it's not part of the teaching of the Buddha. That the teaching of the Buddha is direct. In other words, we're not interested in what the wheel is going to be looking like at the next cycle, We want to know what's happening with the wheel right now, that this is really what the practice is all about. So as we move along, we don't go back to the same place that it used to be. Things always are possibly changing. You could even go so far as to say the moon has never been in the same place twice. Why? Because the moon is circling the Earth, the Earth is circling the Sun, and the Sun is off shooting off someplace in the galaxy. It's also in motion, and the moon never comes back to the same place. It can appear like it does, but actually, not a chance. Nothing is ever going to be the same. Everything is in constant motion. In constant moving. So Samsara actually then doesn't fit in with the teaching of the Buddha about Anicca. When he says Anicca, what does Samskara— everything is constantly moving and it never winds up being exactly the same place that it used to be. How can we use that? Well, we can use that in the sense of if you want to see what's going on, the only way that you can see what's going on is by seeing what's going on right now. This is the only time that we have. In fact, past and future don't really exist. The past is gone. Not only is the past gone, you don't even have a good memory of it. Not exactly. Not unless you've got a camera out and filming it. But when you're reviewing the video that you took, it's not the same. Example of that is a lot of people come to this island for the sunset. Beautiful, gorgeous sunsets. And so when they're looking at the sunset, what do they do? Instead of looking at and enjoying the sunset, they get their cameras out. Fiddle with the cameras and take a video of the sunset. Then they take that video camera home and show it off to their friends and say to the friends, I was there at that sunset and it was so gorgeous. Please look at this video. And you look at the video, how gorgeous is that sunset? Not a chance. A video of a sunset is not a.

**Speaker C:** Sunset.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Just like Anagami.

**Speaker C:** And what is the time?

**Speaker A:** Go ahead.

**Speaker C:** Who's talking?

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** What is the time actually that you are able to see the recording of the past? It's right now also.

**Speaker A:** That is the only time available.

**Speaker D:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** It is the video right now. You're not looking at the sunset anymore. That's the important point. Now you're not looking at the sunset, now you're looking at a video. So the real practice of the Buddha is not what we have been talking about as a gradual path. There is some gradual stuff in it, but the real path is immediately. It happens right here, right now. And if we practice being okay right here, right now, then later when we're around people who are not worth being around and they're doing stuff that is not worth being around, what are we going to do right then and there? The right thing to do is start to practice again right then, because we don't yet have the skills of being able to put up with other people. This is actually pointing at the reason why we have Sangha. We have Sangha to help remind us so that we can practice in the here-now along with people who are practicing in the here-now. At one time, a couple of weeks ago, we were talking about guarding the sense doors. And that we talked about it in the sense of video recordings, or going down the road in a car and keeping your eye on the road instead of watching all the billboards and all the scenery on the side of the road. Because if we're watching the scenery on the side of the road, we'll more than likely not be watching what's happening right in front of us. So you can think of that analogy also is how we live our lives is by watching what's going on around us right here, right now. Now someone asked recently about wholesome in the sense of wholesome on the outside and wholesome on the inside. And the real reality is, is that The outside is neither wholesome nor unwholesome. It's actually just real. All the wholesomeness is going to be on the inside. And so this is where the work is done, is on the inside, because the outside is just real. There's no rights, no wrongs, except when people have those opinions. And when you listen to the opinions of others, They'll tell you whether something is right or wrong, but that doesn't mean that they're right or wrong when they say so. That's just an opinion. So what we're doing is we're learning to come out of our opinions and actually into the state of observing, to look, to look at what's going on. And when we see what's going on, we have the option of being able to change what's going on on the inside. We can't very much change what's happening on the outside, but we can trust that whatever is really happening on the outside is actually just reality. That's all that there is out there. But what is going on on the inside is, are we attuned to the reality that's happening on the inside, and can we adjust that? Because in fact, if we've got unwholesome thoughts on the inside, then that's not being attuned with the reality on the outside. So some people have talked about affirmations, and what I would say an affirmation is, is something like positive thinking. We want the world to look at us or to be in a certain way, that would be an affirmation, and what we're actually practicing here is to getting real, to getting wholesome. We can brighten the mind, gladden the mind, and have a mind that's very happy because we can deal with whatever reality there is out there. This is the main reason why we want to get away from the world out there, because as long as we're dealing with the world out there, so long as we're not guarding the sense doors and letting all kinds of stuff come in from the outside, that stuff affects us, and probably it'll affect us in whatever way we are trained already to have that affecting us. So if we have somebody yelling at us and telling us that we're ignorant and whatnot like that, then we'll react to that the way that we've always acted to it. We don't like it. And so the right way of looking at it is, is that when we're practicing, we need to get away from the outside influences, to guard the sense doors, to not allow the world to affect us, to not allow the games on the cell phone or the news or the documentaries that are on the cell phones. That in fact, if we turn the cell phone off, we can now look at what's happening on the inside of the mind and just be easygoing, restful. Everything is all right just the way that it is. So when we are around other people, it's really good then to guard those sense doors to not be around people who are, let us say, ordinary people who are not guarding their own sense doors. So we don't really have to be in a wat, but it certainly would be valuable if we were around noble people who were noble-minded, who were in the moment and living their lives in the present moment. In reality. This is one of the reasons why we've started this Sangha on Discord, is to make it available worldwide. And from what I've gotten from Ivan just recently, that the number of people on the group calls is increasing. Is that true, Ivan? You're on the group calls.

**Speaker D:** Often? Seems like.

**Speaker A:** It. Yes, go ahead, Dietri.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so about people who are not guarding their senses, sense of doors as you say, it's like, right, as we do that practicing, is that what you call taking refuge in the.

**Speaker A:** Buddha? Well, in regard to what we're talking about here, it would be taking refuge in the Sangha, taking refuge in the other like-minded people who you'll find here on the internet and perhaps other places. I don't know, for instance, any of the wats that are having calls like this, but I do know that there's a Meiji at Wat Suwan Mokk who is doing Zoom calls, and that would be a good, healthy way of spending someone's time. Christina has mentioned that, and Dietrich in our ladies' group, you can look that information up.

**Speaker D:** I saw it.

**Speaker A:** All right, so what we're looking at then is to get away from it all, to get into seclusion. Now, the Buddha talked about seclusion in the following way in Sutta 36, and that is the story of the log in the bog. When a log, a tree log, is in the swamp and it's waterlogged, it can't be set on fire. If you take the log out of the bog and put it on the shore, at that particular point in time, it still cannot be set on fire.. It needs to stay out of the bog for a while so that gravity will pull the water down and the sun will bake the top of it so that even though the water is not completely out of the log yet, at least you can set the top of the log on fire. And so this is why we would say to stay away from the outside world, to go to be alone. That's where we practice. Now, it doesn't matter what kind of posture that you have or what kind of room that you're in. Just to walk in nature and being in the present moment is what we're talking about here. This is what the Buddha really taught. He taught not meditation. You've seen so many people looking at Buddhist meditations, and some people get downright miserable. But the real practice of the teaching of the Buddha is if you catch it correctly, that you're going to have very quick or immediate results. And every time you practice, you'll be glad that you're practicing because you're getting the immediate results right then and there. But most people grab the Dharma from the wrong end. Like the simile of the snake, if you grab a snake by the wrong end, It's going to bite you. And most of the people who have practiced mindfulness meditation or Mahasi Method or whatever like that, they get bitten really badly. They get more miserable, not happy, not obediently. But the teaching of the Buddha, as you've all heard, is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end. So the first time you sit down for meditation, if you're in seclusion, not in the normal environment, not at the bus station or the police station or in a hospital waiting room, but in fact you're alone, then you can begin to get immediate results by gladdening the mind, brightening the mind, saying, wow, I'm really glad to be away from the maddening crowd. Just being alone is better than being in the crowd, and we can appreciate that. Well, I'm glad I'm not in that mess anymore, not right now. So once we begin to practice, we can see then that when we do deal with people, it's better to deal with people who are already in that mind state. And so one of the things that you can do would be to go to the wat. Now, not all wats are, let us say, in that realm. But those that are practicing correctly— and I would say that if you go to a wat, your chances of being in a wholesome environment is astronomically better than if you go to the cinema or to the bar. So going to any wat is going to be better than going to a bar, going to any wat at all. But even there, there are some wats that are better than others. When I was traveling around as a monk in the United States, I used the name-dropping of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. If anybody had known Bhikkhhu Buddhadasa, had heard his name, then I felt that that was a pretty good wat to be in, especially if they were fans of Bhikkhhu Buddhadasa. But I have also found out that there are many monks who are also nobly minded, that have never heard of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. I was actually quite surprised to find that in the Lao Watch, that in fact I would go so far as to say the Lao Watch that I saw in the US were more spiritual, more inclined to correct practice than the Thai Watch. I know I can get some flak for that, but that was what I found. And so the Lao wats that you'll find, and there's about maybe 50 or 60 wats in the US Laotian, altogether about 500. But you will find nobly minded people more likely in the wat, or you can work with the community. Now, one of the problems of the other kind of places An example would be a dojo. A Zen dojo more than likely is not started by a Japanese master Zen practitioner. That more than likely it's some middle-aged Jewish man who has started the Zen dojo, and I would not recommend those kind of places. The same thing would be true about the Tibetan. If there are actual Tibetan monks that are at that Tibetan temple, then you've got a chance. But if it's Westerners who have started a temple, I wouldn't go there. That in fact, what I would say is, is that in, in the Thai tradition, a monk cannot become an abbot of a wat until he's been a monk for 20 years. 20 years is generally enough time for him to have actually gotten introduced to the Dharma and has begun practice. So all of these zendo and all of these meditation centers and whatnot generally don't have people who are doing that. Not only that, but it's very common for a Westerner to say, oh, I want to teach the Dharma, I like it very much. But I need to eat, so I can combine the two of them by starting a retreat center. But now that same guy that started a retreat center, he's not a Dharma teacher, he's a retreat center manager. He's also dealing with the banks and construction companies and food delivery services and all of that kind of stuff. And he is not actually practicing the Dhamma. Often. He's much more of a businessman. For this reason, I would recommend to give meditation retreat centers a miss because they're more than likely do not have elderly seasoned, uh, Dhamma dudes there. But if you also know that, uh, that here we have people who have only been in the Dharma for a few years, but the point is, is that they actually come into the Dharma. And in fact, right here on this group, we have some that I would trust any new student to go spend time with. For instance, with Mikey, with Timo, with, um, Ivan, with, uh, uh, Alex, Any of those guys have been around the Dhamma long enough that they'll give you Dharma even when you want their crap. They won't give you the kind of crap that ordinary people give you. They'll be giving you Dharma. And that's why I would recommend that you do the calls here, is because then you're going to be guarding the mind door, guarding the eye door, by only dealing with wholesome people. Because if somebody that's on that call brings up a pile of shit, the Dharma dude is going to stop that. He's going to put it back straight again. Ivan and I have had several conversations about that. We have the metaphor of the Zen stick. Then in fact, Alex has been using the Zen stick to keep these guys on track. Let's talk Dharma when we're on the Discord groups. We're not going to be talking talking about just any old thing. They were going to be guarding the eye door, guarding the mind door, and the speech door. So that we're actually talking about Dharma, especially in regard to that you can feel good and be free from your Dukkha right here, right now. That this is the real teaching of the Buddha, is to get over it right here, right now. And we practice that over and over again. Now I'll bring up a concept that I call the 3 Ps: Practice, Performance, and Play. And what we're really looking for is to become playful moment by moment, whatever you're doing, treated as non-serious. Nothing is important, everything is joy, everything is just another cosmic joke and you're the punchline, so long as there's a you there. But to get there we need to practice, just like in music. If somebody learns to play the piano, he doesn't learn to play the piano for a long time, but he learns to practice the piano. And we practice that music over and over and over again, and pretty soon, if we're practicing correctly, we begin to like it. Well, this practice that we're doing here is easy, much easier than learning how to play the piano, and so you can get immediate benefits. How is that? Is by looking at the unwholesome, unuseful, invaluable thoughts that we have right here right now and change them into wholesome, happy, good enough thoughts. Everything is all right, everything is fine. We can actually gladden the mind by talking ourselves into it. As I've said before, everybody has spent many, many years talking yourselves into feeling bad. Now it's time to talk yourself into feeling good. And if you can talk yourself into feeling good, you can talk yourself basically into anything, including that you don't have to talk to yourself anymore. You can just enjoy, you can just play. So then there is the time when we need to perform, we need to do what's expected of us, and we have to kind of work at it. I've seen an example would be a recital. When the students have a particular teacher, she'll have a recital, and all the parents and aunts and uncles and maybe another teacher or two and some friends will go to the recital. When the student is playing the music in the recital, he's not playing at it at all. He's working. He's got to make sure every note is correct. It takes many years for a pianist to actually play music. For most of the time, they're practicing, and then for a number of years, they're performing. But eventually, they begin to play the piano. What does that mean by play? That means they get a big kick out of it. A really good example, if you've ever seen him, would be— oh, what's his name? Victor Borg. How many of you know Victor Borg? Have you ever seen him give a piano performance? Not a chance. He's too busy playing the piano and playing with the audience. Okay, so this is what we mean is learn to play with your life, but we need to have some skills built up. And how we get those skills is by practicing the Dharma. Practice becoming playful and then perform being playful when you're out there dealing with all of those other people who are not practicing the Dharma or performing it. The whole world, in fact, you could say that of all the people that you probably know right now, fewer than 5% of them are actually Dhamma people. Most of the people you know are ordinary people with ordinary problems, ordinary suffering, and that you have actually— many of them are in some religion or another who thinks that there is value in suffering, with the idea that, oh, if you suffer enough, then you can get forgiveness. I use the example of the word sorry. How many of you have said the word "sorry" today? "Oh, I'm sorry that I did that." How many of you use that word, "I haven't used it in a long time," without making a big point out of it because I'm not sorry? I may apologize, but my apologies are playful. I'm not sorry. Don't be sorry for what you do wrong. Be playful with what you do wrong. But if you're sorry, that means that we are not practicing correctly. And what we can do instead is change. So if somebody starts talking some crap on the, um, uh, the Discord here— in fact, Alex, just today we were talking about this and, and somebody was putting out some crap and we called him on it. Whack goes that Zen stick! This is foolish talk, this is silly talk. We don't talk like that. We'll delete your post if you talk like that here on Discord. And the guy, he deletes all of his posts that were silly. And then he said, sorry. Well, I hope he's not sorry, because when we're sorry, that means that we feel bad. I'm not interested in anybody feeling bad and being sorry. What I'm interested in is people becoming happy. And so he's posting a bunch of crap, and when he says, "I'm sorry I posted a bunch of crap," that's just more crap. Don't be sorry. Be happy. "Well, I'm glad I don't have to post that crap anymore. I can be mindful. I can watch what I'm doing. I can change it." And so this is the way that we practice. And we practice that with Noble Friends because he can post a bunch of crap over on some other Discord and he'll get people to agree with him. And now you've got a whole bunch of people having a pity party on Discord. Let's not do that. Let's have happy thoughts with happy wholesome language on our groups so that everybody who joins on our Discord groups gains the benefit as if they were actually practicing right then and there in a wat that had noble monks there. So we don't really need to be in a temple, but you're surely a whole lot better off if you are in a temple. And the second best thing to do is to be on a Discord group where people are practicing the Dharma correctly. This is what Sangha is all about. Sangha is actually to— when you're around somebody who is spewing a bunch of garbage, you need to perform your Zen stick. Whack! You don't talk like that here. We're going to have good, happy, wholesome language on this Discord group. And there, that's helping each other. And that, from what Ivan— and actually I've seen some of it— that a number— we have a number of calls, Discord. In fact, this is actually quite a busy Discord group. We've got nearly 700 people in it, and more than 50 people are online at any particular point in time. So there's always somebody there. The reason you don't see them is because we're all just reading what somebody else is writing. But if we find something interesting, we might chime in. But this is something that I can say that we need to really work on, is that issue of practicing. So you practice alone. Remember to keep your mind wholesome. If you want to use that language, keep your mind holy, keep it spiritual, keep it light. We talk about heaven. Well, heaven is in the sky, and the sky is light. You, if you're heavy, you can't fly. I have heard that the reason that angels can fly is because they take themselves so lightly. If you begin to take yourself so lightly, you can fly too. Don't mean you come right out of your chair, but you know what I'm talking about. We have that light, happy mentality, and everything is cool. This is what the Buddha taught. He did not teach any airy-fairy magic. He did not tell a story about gods in heaven or rebirth and reincarnation and heavens and hells and Anagami, any of that kind of stuff. What he taught was you can put your mind into whatever state you want to be in by practicing when you're away from all of the crap of the world. So, does anybody have any comments? Ivan, let me hear.

**Speaker D:** From you.

**Speaker A:** Nothing.

**Speaker D:** To say. Nothing to say.

**Speaker A:** How about you, Mac? Do you have something.

**Speaker D:** To say? Can't.

**Speaker A:** Hear you.

**Speaker B:** Dhammarato, can I say something if?

**Speaker A:** Let me give Mac a chance, he's about to, and then you can too. So Mac, go ahead.

**Speaker D:** I'm listening. I think the voice setting there has a problem, like can't hear you.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, Mac's mic is unmuted, but for some reason we still cannot hear.

**Speaker A:** You, Mac. All right, who was wanting.

**Speaker C:** To talk?

**Speaker B:** Dhammarato, I want to say, how do you— how to apologize without feeling sorry, without feeling bad?

**Speaker A:** Well, that was a bunch of crap. Let's not.

**Speaker C:** Do that.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah. But I feel, you know, I feel.

**Speaker B:** Like if I don't really feel sorry, then I'm not apologizing. Because if someone, if someone needs to apologize to me and he's laughing at my face, and you know, I cannot.

**Speaker A:** Take his apology seriously. Guess what? I would not ever take any apology seriously. That I think in our culture, apologies are highly, highly overrated. Actually, if there's anything to an apology, the only real valuable thing out of an apology would be that someone recognizes that what they just did or have done in the past was offensive and didn't work, didn't have its intended quality. That's all there is. But we don't really need an apology, especially the kind that says, "I'm sorry." So, um, the example of the guy today when he deleted his, um, uh, videos, he could say, I see what you mean and I deleted those videos. And that's all he had to say. He didn't have to say he was sorry. So it depends upon the context, but there is absolutely no reason to say you're sorry, especially when you're not. Isn't that kind of a lie? But it's expected in our society. Actually, I'll go one point further. In the Thai language— we got some Thai people here? Nick? Pardon? Please explain to us what the word kathut means. Oh, kathod. Uh-huh. Yeah, sorry. So like beg them for some— like, kathod means like harm. But kathod is like— kathod has a bad meaning and ka means beg. So we're begging for something like some sort of punishment. Yes, exactly. Isn't it exactly in Thai language the same thing as saying please beat my ass? Wouldn't you say that's what it means? It means please harm me, please beat my ass. Now in the Western language, we use the word sorry because we're wanting forgiveness, because forgiveness is a big deal in the West. It comes out of Christianity. It's like you could go and harm and do all that you want to do, but if you're sorry and you ask for forgiveness, then God's going to forgive you and let you into heaven. We don't do any of that kind of stuff in the Dharma, so there's no reason to feel bad over wrongdoing. That we can learn and make changes without feeling good. In fact, we could be very happy. Oh yeah, I'm glad that I don't use that language now. Thank you for pointing that out to me, that I'm not going to use that kind of language. That's unwholesome language to use with Dhamma students here on the Sangha. So I'm not going to use words like that, mostly referencing sex, because there's no reason to talk about it because there's no value in it. Except that in the West we've been trained that sex is the highest good. I had a talk a few months back about sunyata, bhavana, the highest good. All right, the highest good then would be to recognize that we've done wrong and be very happy that we can see that we've done wrong, because if we can see happily that we've done wrong, we can change it. But if we are sorry for what we've done wrong, we try to hide from it. We don't want to see it. So we're less likely to be able to change when we're sorry than we are if we are happy that we can see the wrongdoing. This is actually correct practice. The Buddha— one point: a lot of people think that an Arahant or a Buddha is a perfect being, never has any unwholesome thoughts at all, and that's not true, as we can see in a number of suttas, especially the section in the Samyutta Nikaya that's devoted to what is called Mara, or the Buddhist devil. And the way that the Buddha handles unwholesome thoughts is by the phrase, the happy phrase, I see you, Mara. And so whenever you have an unwholesome thought and you can see that that's an unwholesome thought, don't say, oh no, I shouldn't have unwholesome thoughts. Oh, poor me, I'm not doing the Dharma correctly. Oh no, now you've committed two sins. The first one is the unwholesome thought, and then the second one is the bigger unwholesome thought about having an unwholesome thought. The right way to do it is, aha, I see that I just screwed up. Be happy that you can see that you screwed up, because only then do you have a happy, positive way of changing the screw-up. Dhammarato? Yes, go ahead, Dietrich.

**Speaker B:** It feels more like it has to do with responsibility, like to say, it's my responsibility. I did this. No excuses. I'm not going to do it again.

**Speaker A:** Something like that. I'm not going to do it again, or better stated, I'm going to watch out to not do that again. Because we can't say permanently I'll never do that again. We don't know what the future is going to be. But you can say I am going to now be mindful that I don't.

**Speaker B:** Do that. Yeah, but, but what do you feel about the.

**Speaker A:** Word responsibility? Well, let us say the word responsibility has to mean the ability to respond, and in this case, the ability to respond wholesomely, to where reaction is what we normally do, and saying sorry is a reaction. What do I mean by reaction? It means that we've acted that way before and we're just acting that way again. And a reaction is always not as, let us say, mindful. It doesn't have any Dhamma with it. But you can, in fact, use the word responsible if the response is wholesome. Otherwise, we're just reacting in an unwholesome way. And this is really good to practice that and perform that on the internet, on our Dharma groups, or when you're at the wat, so that you can learn then to be playful all the time. Because nothing really is that important. Yeah, so what if I screwed up? I've screwed up before. I'm still here. I made that one out alive. Wow, I'm really glad, in fact, that I did all of that screwing up because that helps me to be as happy and wholesome as I am right now. So be grateful, have gratitude that you did all of those screw-ups that you've done has helped you to become happy. And now you can share your joy with others. So you mentioned, Dietrich, before about suffering, that some groups have the idea that you've got to suffer, you've got to hit rock bottom, in fact, before you can change. This is actually something that is well known in Alcoholics Anonymous. For many, many years, judges who would have to deal with alcoholics when they came to court, by assigning them, you've got to go to AA, or other people, you've got to go to therapy. Well, in the example of AA, if somebody is going to therapy or going to AA because they've been told that they've got to go, they're not going to get any value out of it. In fact, they're going to resent their time there. So you have to actually be able to see or recognize your Dukkha. That does not mean that you have to become overwhelmed with Dukkha for many, many long periods of time. Before you want out of it. See the little Dukkha and see, hey, I want out of that too. You don't have to have great big suffering. Now sometimes that's true about— in fact, is he— is Sheep here on the group? I don't see him now. He was here earlier. He's got an alcoholic dad, and the dad has not seen the danger in the alcohol. That's true about the AA. A lot of drunks do not see the danger. But if you can see the danger, if you can see whatever dangers that you have, that's when you can do something about it. But if you see the danger— oh, poor me, I'm an alcoholic, oh, I shouldn't drink— and then I take a next drink because I feel sorry for myself because I'm a drunk, I'm a lush, they call it. The game of lush is drinking more to feel sorry for yourself because you drank too much. But there is no real insight, no wisdom in that. But if the lush can say, hey, wait a minute, I have drunk enough, I have harmed myself enough, let me stop drinking Well, if you think about it, we're all dukkha-holics. We are all attached to our suffering. We think that we're going to get some benefit out of it. That's why we say "sorry," to apologize, is we want somebody else to forgive us so that we don't have to take that responsibility, Dietrich. Taking the responsibility means that we can see the Dukkha and say, "I'm out of that. I'm going to stop doing that. I'm going to do my best to watch what I'm doing and stop doing that." This is correct practice. And it's not at all needed or necessary for one to be sorry. What we need is to be able to see clearly and change. The Buddhist model is a change model. Can you see the unwholesome thought and change it to a wholesome thought? Can you conceive the unwholesome behavior and change it to wholesome behavior? Can you do that well enough to where you can actually do.

**Speaker E:** It playfully?

**Speaker A:** 'Yeah, I screwed that up. I'm going to watch for that one.' That would be playful. 'Oh, poor me. I shouldn't do that. That's a terrible thing. I'm truly sorry.' That's not wholesome. So, Timo, do you have something to say? You were on here. Turn your mic back on, Timo.

**Speaker D:** Can't hear you still.

**Speaker A:** Oh, you can't hear me? You've been on this call this whole hour and you haven't heard me?

**Speaker D:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** CB, what are you doing up so late?

**Speaker B:** Christina, good morning.

**Speaker A:** Good morning.

**Speaker B:** Is right. It looks like I joined at an interesting, interesting topic, but I got— I think I got the good part out.

**Speaker A:** Of it. How about you, baked potato? Do you have something to say? How about you, Jose? Are.

**Speaker F:** You there? Can you hear me now?

**Speaker A:** Yes, I can hear you, whoever is talking. Okay, it's Mac here. Mac, hi Mac, I can hear you now.

**Speaker F:** Okay, hello. I have fiddled with the mic.

**Speaker C:** Here.

**Speaker F:** So I find it interesting, this that you say about Dukkha and people.

**Speaker D:** Being dukkha-holics.

**Speaker F:** I work in a place where I find it increasingly difficult to be, as.

**Speaker A:** It.

**Speaker F:** Seems like a badge of honor to be to be stressed and be behind in your work and be unsatisfied.

**Speaker D:** With the work you do.

**Speaker A:** You work really hard and the boss is going to give you a raise, so you have to really work hard, not necessarily be happily productive, just work hard.

**Speaker F:** Exactly, and I've actually felt it that I've been unselected from doing certain tasks that I actually wanted to do here at my job. Because people think that because I seem content and unstressed in the situation that I do absolutely nothing. And this is sort of starting to bother me. And also that I'm becoming sort of excluded from the company of my co-workers.

**Speaker A:** Because I won't take part in— [Speaker:Dhammarato] It's marvelous that you don't have to put up with their.

**Speaker F:** Crap. Exactly. It does sort of give me— I teach and I enjoy being with the young people that I teach very much, but you know, we teach as a group of teachers and I find it difficult to find someone to.

**Speaker A:** Work with.

**Speaker F:** So I find it interesting, this Dukkha-holism that that.

**Speaker D:** You say.

**Speaker A:** All right. Well, just because others suffer doesn't mean that you need to suffer, but it's hard, especially for the beginners, to be around people who are suffering, to not suffer along with them, because they expect you to suffer as much as they do. Misery loves company. When people are angry, they want other people to be angry too. When people are miserable, they want people to be miserable. It's only here, in places like this Sangha, is where you'll find people who are expecting you to.

**Speaker F:** Be happy. It's working very well.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. So, José, did you hear my call? Can you turn your mic on and let us have it? How about you, Michael Swift? Are you there? I'm here, Dhammarato. Thank you. No, this was a wonderful talk. I, um, can recognize what you said about the dukkha-holics. As you know, I'm in recovery. And that's something that I stay away from in some of the 12-step meetings because it seems like people have put the substances down, but they still got the Dukkha. So that's a big part of what's brought me to the teachings of the Buddha, the Buddha path. So good to be here. Thank you, Dhammarato. Excellent. So if you become a mentor, then in AA, You can mentor them to come not only out of their alcohol but out of all of their misery. That's right. Yeah. So we got some new people on. How about you, Z? Do you have something to say? There you go. Hello and welcome, Z. What do you have to say? I hear your microphone clicking. How about you, Ioannis? You got your microphone on already. What do you have to say?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I wanted to say that it's very— this is something that I've been thinking a lot because of being a Dukkha-holic, because there seems to be a benefit to, you know, self-flagellation basically. Like, if you're sorry and you're like playing the victim, uh, like, you— other people won't want to hurt you. At least that's how it seems, uh, but then like you're just kind of hurting yourself. And yeah, like, also the, uh, the co-worker story. If you are at the job and you act as if you're struggling and like you're working really hard then the boss is going to notice that. So there seems that the Dukkha and the hindrances, they always tell me, like, oh, you need me, like I've protected you. Like, if you feel bad, others won't try to hurt you. This is what.

**Speaker A:** I've noticed. Yes, that everybody wants you to be miserable. So once they've gotten you miserable, They'll just go to the guy who can do next. In fact, I have heard the story of that. There was a group of people, of Christians, who were out proselytizing, and they came up to this guy and started talking their shtick about proselytizing. And he says, oh well, I'm in seminary right now studying to become a preacher. And they, without even saying a word, just walked away. They don't want to talk to him He's already part of the group. Same thing, I mean, misery really loves company. They want you to be part of their misery group. And once they've gotten you miserable, they don't need you anymore. They'll go get somebody else to pick on. So Red, what do you have.

**Speaker D:** To say?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** I do. I do follow— actually, I co-host meditation sessions, and I try to channel the wholesome stuff. Prajna also does participate in those calls too. I heard you, and I heard you talking about the Dukkha-holics, and I also participate in a support group, and I see what you're trying to say about the AA stuff, the Alcoholics Anonymous, and yeah, just allowing people to try to find a Dhamma, even if they don't accept that directly, trying to find that tongue-in-cheek way to make it positive and make it, uh, giving, giving, give them a wholesome path to get out of the suffering that they have in those support groups also. Like, yeah, I would love to hear.

**Speaker A:** You commenting on that too. Well, I'll say one thing about the word positive. And that is that often positivity is not what we need. We do not need the power of positive thinking. We need to think in reality. And the reality is, reality is actually a paradise. We already live in paradise. That's the reality of the situation. We don't have to take a hell and try to positivity it into a paradise. We're already in paradise. And so I don't use the word positive or positivity. What we use instead is the word wholesome, which has a whole lot closer connotation to being real. Everything is.

**Speaker C:** Real enough. It's real enough, it's good enough, it's wholesome enough. And we just— we're laying that to more people. Allow more people to see the wholesome stuff from life and we giving, okay, did you try this to not like not put yourself into more misery that you already are? And okay, maybe just doing Y, X instead of Y, and then just allowing that to see more of reality and to just allow suffering to go. As much as possible.

**Speaker A:** Well, it's not a matter of allowing it to go. It's a matter of taking active duty to take an active role of right noble effort to kick that stuff out, to keep kicking it out and keep kicking it out and keep kicking.

**Speaker C:** It out. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So it's double duty, basically. Right, it's not a matter of letting go, it's a matter of flicking it off to get rid of it, throw it out, because that stuff is really sticky. The example would be— let me see if I can— yes, yeah, here we go. You see this in my hand? It's actually a hub, but I let go of it. Why is it still in my hand? Why is it in my hand? I let go of it. Why doesn't it float off? It's not going to. I have to actually actively put it down.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, without holding.

**Speaker G:** It.

**Speaker A:** Yes, double duty, basically. Thanks for sharing. So let me get somebody else. How about you, Robert? You're new on your group here. What do you have to say?

**Speaker G:** Well, is my mic on? Can you.

**Speaker A:** Hear me? Yes, I can hear you, Rob.

**Speaker G:** I liked what you said about apologizing. Something that Max said made me think of what we talked about a little while ago, or a couple of days ago, about balancing the normal life with Dhamma. So what he— at work, balancing work life with Dhamma. And I think that's what helps with being a monk. You don't have to balance all of the unwholesome stuff with.

**Speaker A:** The wholesome. Right. When you're at work, you're going to be around an awful lot of unwholesome people. If you're at the right wat, you're going to be around an awful lot of people who are wholesome almost all.

**Speaker G:** The time. And something else I wanted to ask about was seclusion. You mentioned seclusion. And some people that I've talked to on the group, they don't really have semi-formal meditation sats, they just drop it immediately. And I know it's a thing of you can drop it immediately and go straight to the wholesome, but I assume that for, because I've also seen videos by you where you said that it's good to do like a short formal semi-formal Anapanasati sats where you get your, you're in seclusion and in seclusion you get yourself into a good state. I assume that then later you can do it immediately, or you can do it immediately already. But for beginners, it's good to practice.

**Speaker A:** In seclusion, I assume. Yes, it is very good to practice in seclusion, just like it's very good to practice if you're a new student of a piano to be in a room by yourself. You do not want your mom flick changing the pages nor having Aunt Susie sit there and listen to you practice. You want to do that alone. Yeah, yeah. So we want to do this practice alone so that we can begin to see what our own mind is doing rather than all the noise.

**Speaker G:** And then when you practice.

**Speaker A:** You can start. Yeah, and I would recommend to spend a lot of time in seclusion. The more time that you spend in seclusion is the less time that you have to put up with all the crap that you've got to put up with from other people, including the stuff that you remember and repeat that you got from other people. To take some time and get away from other people— don't get away from it all, just get into seclusion. Close the door behind you. And being in an empty room, that's what the Buddha recommends. He does not recommend going on retreats, because if you're on a retreat, you're around what, 100 people pretending to be in noble silence? All right, so let's see, how about you, uh, uh, Puman? Do you have something.

**Speaker D:** To say? I think.

**Speaker A:** He'S sleeping. No, he was awake. Oh, he's smiling now, so I know he's awake. He must be trying to find a place to click to get his mic going. It should be in the bottom middle of the screen.

**Speaker D:** There you go. Oh, so we were talking about me. I thought you said somebody else.

**Speaker A:** I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

**Speaker D:** Go ahead. So you hear me now? Yes. Thank you, thank you, Dhammarato. I enjoy your talk, and I was reflecting upon this analogy between alcoholism and dukkha holism. Alcoholism, I'm just thinking like, probably not drawn to alcohol because of the alcohol, because some people drinking don't have a problem. It's probably the relief and the fact that it's drunk. So then I'm just thinking regarding dukkha, let's say I'm lying to somebody. And I started thinking probably it's also because I'm drawn into getting some relief from the fact I'm lying to somebody. And so that might be just the fact to cover something I don't want others to see in me. I'm just kind of reflecting that way, just trying to see to the bottom of.

**Speaker A:** This analogy. You could say that anything that's mind-altering is more like a scab removal, that if you drink or you take drugs, then it's— that's just ripping the scab off so you can get down to what's really there. That's why you find so many bar fights. Most fights happen either in a bar or when somebody's come home from a bar. But that's also why it's so violent out on the streets where they're taking fentanyl or today's popular whatever it is, is people really feel bad. They don't feel better when they're drunk. That's why they get angry and fighting and whatnot like that. But they are kind of unaware of how bad they do feel because of the buzz. So Alex, what are you thinking, friend?

**Speaker D:** No, I like that we talked about seclusion, and I really liked that you mentioned, um, not suffering alongside other people. I know that was something that we talked about this morning in the group call that we had as well, and I like to point that out because that word compassion that everyone uses has that meaning with it, that meaning of suffering.

**Speaker A:** Alongside someone.

**Speaker D:** Compassion.

**Speaker A:** Compassion. Yeah, that's the way to be compassionate, by not falling into their trap.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I like that you pointed that out. I appreciated that. I'm glad that we came back to talking about seclusion.

**Speaker A:** Again too. All right, so Ivan, what do you have.

**Speaker D:** To say? Yeah, really, I was laughing when you said the word Dukkha, just now. And yeah, it's really true. It's almost like when you practice, or at least when I practice more and more, it seems more and more obvious. Like, I mean, it's always there. But for some reason, I don't know, maybe I justify or whatever, I don't see it. But it's becoming more and more clearer how quick the world can just pull you in and, you know, they want you to be miserable or something like that. It's really funny. Yeah, it's really funny. You have a laugh about it sometimes.

**Speaker A:** But yeah. They talk about like raining on your parade. Well, if people have got a whole lot of Dukkha, wow, they're ready to put it in their water gun and just spray you with their Dukkha. So this is part of the reason why, especially in the beginning but throughout your entire practice, practice in seclusion. Get yourself into a really, really good state when you're alone. So Ben, what do you have to say? Great talk. Thanks, Dhammarato.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, no questions, but yeah, misery loves company, but happiness is contagious.

**Speaker A:** So we can spread it to others. Yes, it is. All right. Jose, are you on yet? You here yet? Karwan, do you have any last things.

**Speaker D:** To say?

**Speaker B:** Dhammarato, I have always something to say. You know, basically, Dukkha is anything that feels heavy. It does not matter whether we call it compassion or anything else, as long.

**Speaker D:** As it feels heavy, we can drop.

**Speaker A:** It and say, okay, this is Dukkha, correct? If something is important, doesn't that mean that it's heavy? That's why we get away— uh, you'll never— you'll not hear me generally say it's important to be in seclusion. That's adding heaviness to it. No, it's delightful to be in seclusion. It is a great fruit, a great benefit to be in seclusion. You don't have to listen to any of.

**Speaker C:** That crap.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so, so do not even make— yeah, what was that, Kawan? So Paul, are you here?

**Speaker D:** Yes, uh, just wanted to say that the Sangha is an excellent way to forget our Dukkha-ism and be reminded of the practice and being wholesome. It's quite joyful sharing time with the Sangha. And yeah, it's mostly us reminding each other to practice correctly with a few jokes thrown around.

**Speaker A:** Thank you so much. So does anybody else have anything to say? I'm all, I'm all, I got you. Do you have something to say?

**Speaker B:** Hello. Hi, Dhammarato. Thank you so much for the reminder to practice in seclusion. Also, I really liked the talk about that feeling sorry is a form of feeling bad and it's hindrance to being able to make the change. So there's no need to feel sorry. We can just pay attention to what is happening and make.

**Speaker A:** The change.

**Speaker B:** That's good.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. Yes. All right. So does anybody have any final things to say?

**Speaker B:** Thanks, everybody.

**Speaker A:** So, Mikey, take.

**Speaker E:** It home. Yeah. Thanks, friends, for joining these calls. It's a delightful reminder, regardless of where you are in your practice. It's such a joy to chat and listen to the noble Buddha Dhamma. So yeah, continue hanging out here. You know, for those of you that joined late, you can stay on and keep chatting.

**Speaker A:** It's okay.

**Speaker E:** This is an excellent place to make friends. And yeah, as Dhammarato mentioned earlier in the call, we've been seeing about 50 people or so online at any given time. So, you know, if you're feeling like talking the Dharma, you can just hang out in the Hangout channel and see who else shows up, kind of get an impromptu call going. We enjoy seeing that. So yeah, thank you again, friends, for being here today. And yeah, this has been quite a splendid call. And yeah, take care, enjoy, take.

**Speaker A:** It easy. Happy— just stay online. We'll go ahead and finish the call formally and turn the video recorder off. Now. So glad you're here, but you don't have to go. You can just hang out and talk with each other. Yeah, so bye-bye.

**Speaker D:** Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. Bye, friends.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends, focuses on reinterpreting core Buddhist concepts for immediate, practical application. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: The Present Moment Over Cyclical Stories**
*   **Samsara is a Spiral, Not a Wheel:** Dhammarato challenges the traditional view of Samsara as a repetitive cycle. Using the analogy of Earth's orbit, he explains it's more like a spiral—you never return to the exact same point because everything is in constant change (*anicca*). Therefore, obsessing over future cycles or past results is irrelevant to the Buddha's core teaching.
*   **Focus on "Right Now":** The only time we can work with is the present. The past is gone and the future is unknown. The practice is about seeing and dealing with what is happening **right here, right now**.

### **The Practice: Cultivating Wholesomeness Internally**
*   **Guard the Sense Doors:** To practice effectively, we must learn to guard our senses (sight, hearing, mind, etc.) from unwholesome external influences (e.g., distressing news, negative people, trivial distractions). This creates the seclusion needed to observe the mind.
*   **Wholesomeness is an Inside Job:** The external world is simply "real"; it is neither inherently wholesome nor unwholesome. All wholesomeness is cultivated **internally** by adjusting our thoughts and reactions to that reality.
*   **Change the Mind, Don't Just "Let Go":** The path is an active "change model." When an unwholesome thought arises, see it clearly and **actively change it** to a wholesome, happy, and light thought. Don't just "let it go" or wallow in self-judgment ("I shouldn't have that thought").
*   **The Importance of Seclusion:** Regularly spending time alone (seclusion) is essential, especially for beginners. It's like practicing an instrument alone before performing. It allows you to see your mind's habits without external "crap" and learn to gladden it.

### **Community and Conduct**
*   **Role of the Sangha:** A noble Sangha (community) serves as a refuge and a guardrail. It provides a wholesome environment with like-minded people who help correct each other playfully (using the metaphor of the "Zen stick") to stay on the Dhamma path and avoid unwholesome speech and behavior.
*   **Beyond "Sorry" – Playful Responsibility:** The group critiques the culture of apology ("I'm sorry") as often being a form of unwholesome self-pity rooted in Abrahamic ideas of forgiveness. The Dhamma alternative is to **playfully take responsibility**: see the mistake, be happy you can see it, and change it. Move from reaction to wholesome response.
*   **The 3 Ps: Practice, Performance, Play:** The goal is to reach a state of **Play**, where life is treated as a non-serious, joyful activity. To get there, one must **Practice** in seclusion, then **Perform** that practice in the world, until it becomes natural and playful.

### **Countering "Dukkha-holism"**
*   A significant portion of the talk addresses the tendency to be attached to suffering ("dukkha-holics"). People often believe there is a benefit to misery (e.g., gaining sympathy, appearing hard-working, avoiding further hurt).
*   **Misery loves company,** and the world will often try to pull you into its suffering. The practice builds the strength to not "suffer alongside" others in the name of false compassion, but to remain wholesome and happy, which is truly contagious.
*   The true practice leads to lightness and happiness, not heaviness and importance.

### **Practical Advice**
*   **Seek Noble Friends:** Prioritize spending time with people practicing correctly, whether in a good monastery (*wat*) or a well-moderated online Sangha (like their Discord group).
*   **Be Wary of Commercial Retreats:** Dhammarato cautions against many Western-run meditation centers, which can be more focused on business than genuine Dhamma practice led by seasoned practitioners.
*   **Immediate Results:** Correct practice of the Buddha's teaching should yield immediate benefits—feeling glad, light, and happy **in the very moment you practice**.

In essence, the talk emphasizes a direct, pragmatic, and joyful application of the Dhamma. It moves away from metaphysical cycles and heavy rituals, focusing instead on the immediate work of guarding the senses, changing unwholesome thoughts to wholesome ones in seclusion, and cultivating a playful, light heart supported by a noble community.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate their points about Buddhist practice, mindfulness, and the nature of reality. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Key Metaphors and Analogies**

1. **Samsara as a Spiral (Not a Wheel)**
   - **Metaphor**: The Earth’s rotation and orbit around the sun. The Earth doesn’t return to the exact same point after 24 hours because it’s also moving forward—like a spiral.
   - **Purpose**: To explain that Samsara (the cycle of existence) is not a repetitive loop but a constantly changing process. Things never return exactly the same way.

2. **The Cart Wheel**
   - **Metaphor**: A wheel on a moving cart. By the time the wheel completes a rotation, the cart has moved, so the wheel isn’t in the same place.
   - **Purpose**: Reinforces the idea that everything is in constant motion and change (Anicca). The past is gone; only the present moment is real.

3. **Video of a Sunset**
   - **Story**: People watch a beautiful sunset through their camera screens, then later show the video to friends, thinking it captures the experience.
   - **Purpose**: To illustrate the difference between direct experience (“looking at the sunset”) and indirect, remembered experience (“looking at a video”). Emphasizes being present “right now.”

4. **Driving and Guarding the Sense Doors**
   - **Metaphor**: Driving a car and keeping your eyes on the road instead of getting distracted by billboards or scenery.
   - **Purpose**: Compares mindfulness to focused attention—guarding the “sense doors” (eyes, ears, mind) from unwholesome distractions.

5. **The Log in the Bog (from Sutta 36)**
   - **Story**: A waterlogged log in a swamp can’t catch fire. Only when removed and dried by the sun can it ignite.
   - **Purpose**: Symbolizes the need for **seclusion** from worldly distractions to “dry out” and become receptive to Dhamma practice.

6. **Grabbing a Snake by the Wrong End**
   - **Metaphor**: If you grab a snake by the tail, it will bite you.
   - **Purpose**: Warns against misunderstanding or misapplying Buddhist teachings (e.g., meditation techniques that increase misery instead of reducing suffering).

7. **The 3 Ps: Practice, Performance, Play**
   - **Metaphor**: Learning to play the piano. First, you **practice** repetitively. Then you **perform** with focused effort. Finally, you **play** with joy and spontaneity (like Victor Borge).
   - **Purpose**: Describes the progression in Dhamma practice—from diligent practice to playful, joyful living in the present.

8. **Angels Can Fly Because They Take Themselves Lightly**
   - **Metaphor**: Angels fly because they are light, not weighed down by heaviness.
   - **Purpose**: Encourages a light-hearted, non-serious attitude toward life and practice. “Heaven” is equated with a light, joyful mind.

9. **The Zen Stick**
   - **Metaphor**: A “Zen stick” used in meditation halls to correct posture or attention. Here, it’s used figuratively to correct unwholesome speech or behavior in the Sangha.
   - **Purpose**: Illustrates how the community (Sangha) helps “whack” away unskillful talk, keeping discussions wholesome and on-track.

10. **Dukkha-holics**
    - **Metaphor**: Comparing attachment to suffering (Dukkha) to alcoholism—an addiction to negative mental habits.
    - **Purpose**: Highlights how people often cling to suffering, complain, and resist happiness, even when relief is available.

11. **Letting Go vs. Actively Removing**
    - **Metaphor**: Trying to “let go” of a sticky object (like a hub) that doesn’t fall unless actively flicked away.
    - **Purpose**: Emphasizes that ending suffering requires **active effort**, not passive “letting go.”

### **Stories and Anecdotes**
- **Western-Led Meditation Centers**: A story about “middle-aged Jewish men” running Zen dojos or retreat centers as businesses rather than true Dhamma environments.
- **Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)**: References to AA to illustrate how people often don’t change until they “hit rock bottom,” but in Dhamma, you don’t need extreme suffering—you can change by seeing even small dissatisfactions.
- **Workplace Misery**: Anecdotes about coworkers who wear stress as a “badge of honor” and exclude those who are content.
- **The Word “Sorry”**: A cultural critique of “sorry” as a request for punishment (linked to the Thai word *kathod*—”please beat my ass”) and a Christian framework of guilt/forgiveness, contrasting it with the Dhamma approach of mindful change without self-blame.

### **Overall Themes**
These metaphors and stories collectively emphasize:
- **Impermanence and change** (spiral, wheel on cart).
- **The importance of present-moment awareness** (sunset video, driving).
- **The need for seclusion and wholesome community** (log in bog, Zen stick, Sangha).
- **Active, playful effort over grim determination** (3 Ps, angels flying).
- **Replacing unwholesome habits with wholesome ones** without guilt (sorry vs. change).

The speaker uses everyday imagery to make abstract Buddhist concepts accessible and practical.
