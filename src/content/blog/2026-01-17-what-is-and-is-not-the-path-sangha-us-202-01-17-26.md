### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So today is January 17th, year 2026, and today we're going to be talking about what is and is not the path. And that what is and is not the path is actually in several suttas, but one most specifically is Sutta number 24. Where it's a level of attainment, but it's not an attainment. Let us say that what is attained is only the knowledge of what is the path, because when we find out what is the path, then we find out that everything else is not the path. But today we're going to be spending a little bit of time talking about what is the path. And then quite a lot of time talking about what is not the path in a specific kind of way. So first off, I'll start with the question, and Gigi, I'll give you this question to see if you have a decent answer to it. It's a which came first kind of question. What comes first? Dukkha or dissatisfaction, disappointment, danger, etc., or pleasure in the human existence? Which comes first, pleasure or disappointment?

**Speaker B:** I was listening to your talk on this and there was all of these people answering and I started getting confused. I was like, wait, someone said for someone first Someone said suffering, then the other one said pleasure, or someone said dissatisfaction and then said pleasure. So I'm a little confused right now. It was a beautiful long talk, but yeah.

**Speaker A:** Let's make sure then that everyone here understands that when the Buddha started, he talked about what he teaches is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. But the Dukkha that the Buddha is talking about is based upon the dissatisfaction of not getting what we want, and what we want is pleasure, that the pleasure-seeking is built in, and the Dukkha is that which is added on, that in fact there are many suttas where pleasure and joy is emphasized, is emphasized in developing joy as, let us say, a skill to be developed. It talks about spending time in joy and pleasure, and that the main point is that We seek pleasure and become disappointed because we're seeking pleasure in the wrong places. Where we're seeking pleasure normally is in the senses—the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, the taste, 5 of them—which can be very quickly summarized as relationships, that we seek our joy in relationships, like my relationship to my hot rod car, or Alex is in a relationship with his Harley-Davidson motorbike, etc., like that. Okay, so we are in relationships with the things on the outside, And that motorbike can get stolen, that car can get wrecked, that relationship with Harry and Sally can go sour. So the Buddha talks about pleasure that can be found within one's own mind, and there it can be actually not just found but developed coordinated and controlled. When one can in fact control their own pleasure, then everything else is not important. Now, in Western Buddhism—and I'll start off by saying that Western Buddhism is not the path, that in fact much of what the Buddha taught has been changed over the centuries, that in the time of the Buddha, most of the people were in some sort of spiritual practice. The Brahmins, the fire worshippers, the Jains, the Nataputtas who sought to flagellate themselves, hoping that they could burn off all the old bad Kamma. They performed ritualized pain. But one of the questions that the Buddha asked them was, is that, oh, if that were the case, that if you could burn off old bad Kamma, then wouldn't sick people, prisoners, and animals be enlightened before you? Because they all have pain. So pain is not the path. Pain does not burn off old pain. That in fact, what pain is, is basically not getting what one wants. Now, there are basically three kinds of feelings, and when I say feelings, we're talking about Vedana, we're not talking about emotion. The feeling of I like it, or finding pleasure. Then there is the opposite of that, which is finding displeasure, but almost always displeasure is because we're not getting what we do want. And then there is a third kind of feeling, which is kind of a mixed bag. And that mixed bag actually is associated with ignorance, because we don't know how we feel, we don't know what to feel. Sometimes we become confused about what am I supposed to feel or not. And so we try to make something out of it. Now, as you probably know, the human is prone to not like that which is the unknown. You could go so far as to say that's the territorial instinct, that we're okay because I know we, but they're not okay because I don't know them. But what happens when a person has a feeling that they don't know what it is. The answer is that it generally turns into, "I don't like it." It doesn't turn into the pleasure of investigation. So, what we can say now is that the teaching of the Buddha has a specific path called the Eightfold Noble Path, that is able to get us out of our dissatisfactions over not getting what we want by training the mind into finding pleasure in the right places. We can get pleasure, and when we find that pleasure, whether it's a small pleasure or over-the-moon pleasure— in fact, one of the problems with with Westerners is that little pleasures are not enough. They want the big stuff. And so they're not satisfied with the joy of just being okay. I've heard many students talk about it in the sense of satisfaction. Now, what is satisfaction? It's exactly opposite of Dukkha. Dukkha is dissatisfaction, disappointment. And that Sukkha then is being satisfied. And so the students will say, "Yeah, I'm satisfied, but not enough satisfaction." Well, if not enough satisfaction, what is that? That's dissatisfaction. In fact, it's kind of a lie, or it's kind of that third feeling that it's not enough satisfaction, and so it's actually dissatisfying. So if I can say it like this in a very short way, the entire teaching of the Buddha is in correctly finding our way to pleasure. That is the path. There is a pathway to that path, the Eightfold Noble Path. The Eightfold Noble Path also has a specific practice that is referred to as Anapanasati. And Anapanasati is not just a breathing meditation, but is in fact, it's an all-encompassing practice that works with feelings, works with attitudes, works with mind states and mental objects, as well as getting the body into a state of relaxation. So that, in short, is the teaching of the Buddha. Now, a little bit more detail would be that there is an actual procedure that is based upon 3 points. One is Sati, to remember to be in this present moment. Most often our dissatisfactions come from remorse about the past or not having what we want now, and so we'll want it in the future also. So past and future are really dangerous places, but the present moment is fairly safe. Moment by moment by moment by moment throughout your life, almost always the present moment has been safe. And all of the dangers were, let us say, short spikes in time. And yet we spend a lot of our mind moments thinking about the past, thinking about the dangers, and so we wind up being in danger mentally when physically we're not in danger at all. And so the first point of Sati is to remember to come into the present moment. This is what the practice is. And then when we're in the present moment, the next one, which is the Buddha says is the big deal, the important one, is looking. The word ditti is translated as to view, and he talks about wrong view. And he talks about ordinary right view, but ordinary right view and wrong view are, let us say, viewpoints, concepts, long-term views, to where right noble view is not a noun, it's a verb. Right noble viewing, look, to look at what's happening in the mind right now and then The third item, which is the most important in this case, is that once we can see, we can change. If you can't see, you can't change. If you're fumbling around in the drawer trying to find a pen but you're not looking, you're just fumbling with your hand, the best thing to do if you can't find a pen is to actually look into the drawer and see the pen, and then you can take that pen in hand. That's the change. What good would it be to look in the drawer to find a pen if you just leave the pen in the drawer? No, we want to use that pen. So this is an important point, these three things together: to remember, to look, and to change. To remember, to look, and to change. Now, if we keep doing that over and over again, even though the mind is subject to habits and old ways of doing things, fairly soon we begin to change our attitude that, wow, I can do this. I can remember to look and to change. This is where we begin to congratulate ourselves. This is actually part of the Eightfold Noble Path. We've covered 4 of them now. And with these 4 of remember to look, to change, and to congratulate yourself. Most people, in fact, don't do that. They might remember to look, and when they see it, they don't like it, and so now they begin to feel bad, and they're not looking at it anymore. So this is where nurturing comes in, to remember to see what you're doing with the thought of changing it rather than the thought of not liking it. In fact, you begin to get the pleasure through the changing. Because remember, we're seeking pleasure here. We're not trying to find out where all the problems are. We're only finding the problems in the sense of being able to change them. So with that, 4 items—remember to look, to change, and to congratulate—comes an organized, unified mind. With that unified, organized mind, the Pali word for it is Samadhi, and Samadhi, like so many other words, have been wrongly translated into English. With that point of having an organized, unified mind, if that person who has that mind in that moment doesn't want anything. Saddha doesn't want anything from Harry, then she's okay. But if Saddha wants something from Harry, she's not in a noble state of mind. And the best thing for her to do is to go off and get into seclusion. The Buddha was actually quite big on seclusion, to get away from other people, especially other people who were in a state of dissatisfaction, so that their dissatisfaction doesn't rub off on you, and therefore you can get your own mind into a state of satisfaction, and then you can come back and deal with their dissatisfaction happily. But if your satisfaction is not strong, their dissatisfaction will probably be strong enough to pull you back into dissatisfaction. Time to take another hike, to get away from them. And so the Buddha was actually quite big on seclusion. But surprise, surprise, he was also big on Sangha. Now Sangha is actually being around other people who are noble, a noble Sangha, so that when you're around other people who are not in the state of dissatisfaction, they can help you come out of your state of dissatisfaction, and everybody can be happy and satisfied together. So this is a very, very brief discussion. Now let's start talking about what is not the path. Now, over time, there has always been those who were not on the path. In fact, you could go so far as to say that within a particular small group or very large group it would run somewhere between 90 to 100%. Of all of the billions of Christians on the planet Earth, maybe 1 or 2 at a time will become free from Dukkha. Those are very bad odds. We're talking about 99.999— how many 9s do we have there? Of failure that is within what we would call Christianity or other religions. But the Buddha did teach a path that is liberating, if we are able to consistently stay on that path. And once we really understand what the path is, we become dedicated to staying own the path. But for those who have never found the path, they have, let us say, stayed around over the centuries, actually changing what the Buddha taught. That by the 3rd century, 200 years after the time of the Buddha, there was an emperor called Ashoka. And that he was so, let's say, joyful about what the Buddha taught, that he wanted to make Buddhism a state religion. And he was giving robes and bowls and housing, and anybody who wanted to— well, guess what? Almost everybody did. All of those wanderers and rishis and ascetics who were doing the wrong practice came. And imagine that it was like a— I'll give the example of a daycare. If you have a daycare that has 25 3-year-olds and 2 nursery workers, guess who the average 3-year-old learns from? Now let's take that and give a different example. We have a 3-year-old here who is in a family. He has two grandparents on one side, two grandparents on the other, uncles, aunts, older siblings, and perhaps some good nannies, teachers, whatever like that. So now one kid has 25 adults around. Which of them is going to get a better education? The child that is around 25 3-year-olds, or the 3-year-old who is around 25 adults? This is exactly what happened in the time of Asoka. And so this was the beginning of the Mahayana, and that much of the teaching of the Buddha then was diddled with. They put in all kinds of things that are not the teaching of the Buddha, and that has been there ever since. Now, there was a particular monk, his name was Bhikkhu Buddhaghosa, who was about 450 AD, and his background was Brahmin, and he wrote a book called the Visuddhimagga. Now, the Visuddhimagga actually was written in Sri Lanka, and so the Sri Lankan monks had really loved it. It got very, very high marks in Burma also, and even in Thailand. And so when a particular monk could see that the Visuddhimagga had a lot of errors in it, he was slow to say something about it. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, by the way, was already kind of seeing that the Visuddhimagga was not the path. And that he was saying this back in the 1950s, but by the 1980s when he was an old man, when his Wat Soan Mokkh was firmly established, he was well known as a teacher, that's when he would say that the Visuddhimagga, if you threw every copy of it into the ocean, we might be better off with the actual teachings of the Buddha, that the teachings in the Visuddhimagga actually do not lead to the end of suffering. Now, in the 1800s, 1900s, early 1900s, and early in the, let us say, the late 1800s, there was political turmoil in Burma. And that's when they took this stuff out of the Visuddhimagga to try to teach people. They called it Vipassana. This Vipassana teaching then was widespread in Burma, and several Westerners in the '60s and '70s, because of the visas, could not stay in Burma for very long. And so they picked up a little bit of Vipassana and brought it to the West. And because they were psychologists, they then started using it. I won't bother to name names, but it became the predominant teaching in the West of Vipassana. Now, one of the things that the Buddha said was, and you can see this, if his system is based upon gaining pleasure wherever it may be found, so long as it's wholesome pleasure, mental pleasure, then you can see why in that regard his teaching is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end. And yet there's a lot of stuff about Vipassana meditation that is not good in the beginning, gets really desperate in the middle, and nobody ever gets to the end because they get stuck someplace in the middle. An example of that is that in the Visuddhimagga, there is a thing, a work called the 16 Stages of Insight. Now that 16 Stages of Insight, especially the way that it's set up, is that the students are supposed to use Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta to see the three characteristics, so that they begin to see the disillusionment. And with that disillusionment, they become fearful, miserable, in a state of despair, wanting to find a way out of it, and then finally taking on the right noble effort and start practicing the Four Noble Truths. Now we start with the Four Noble Truths immediately in the sense of let us see what the Dukkha is so that we can avoid it immediately, and in the 16 stages of insight it's step 12, leaving the students in a lot of unhappy states that are ordinary, and it doesn't teach pleasure at all. So it stays with the three characteristics of Anicca, Dukkha, and Arhat. Now, Anicca, Dukkha, and Arhat are teachings of the Buddha, but they're not framed together, stuck together as a teaching or as a method. The Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path is the method of the Buddha. And that the whole idea is, is can you see Dukkha? If you can see it immediately, you can get out of it. That's not what is practiced in current systems with either the Mahasi or the choiceless awareness. You can see that choiceless might have some problems immediately. And so they think that they need to analyze Dukkha. Oh, if we get really expert in Dukkha, then we'll be able to do something about it. Yeah, you're in Dukkha. You're analyzing it. There you are. You're stuck. And you're not even taking the time to immediately get out of it. So my little story is imagine you're walking down the sidewalk and there you find a dog pile right in the middle of the sidewalk. What are you going to do? Well, choiceless awareness will see it and step right in it. The Maharshi method, they'll take that dog doodle into their kitchen, slice it, dice it, analyze it, powder it, fry it, and eat it. And then they get indigestion called their dark night. This is not the path of the Buddha. The path of the Buddha is easy to see dog doodle as dog doodle and step around it immediately. Don't play with it. Dukkha is not to be investigated, it's to be seen, immediately avoided. This is the actual teaching of the Buddha. Now, that which is not the practice then— Gigi, you made a point about thoughtlessness. Now, this actually is not the teaching of the Buddha. The Buddha would teach the first Jhana, where we have applied and sustained thought. Now, what does apply mean? It means that we apply your investigative skills to the mind to see what is there. And as we continue to do that, we gain the skill so that it's not just temporary or momentarily, it begins to sustain itself so that you can watch what the mind is doing over a period of time. But that applied and sustained thought is now understood by Westerners as you got to get into no-thought. There is no place in the suttas where the Buddha talks about no-thought. There are some places in Zen when they talk about it, but let us say, see where it is in reference to what the Buddha taught. Now, in the first Jhana, which is actually quite possible for people to get into, has 5 factors: applied sustained thought, freedom from unwholesome thoughts, because we see those unwholesome thoughts and change them into wholesome thoughts, into happy thoughts, so that we develop Sukkha. Sukkha is exactly opposite of Dukkha. And so if you can get into first Jhana, you can be free from suffering. The Buddha says this in Sutta number 36 in the Majjhimanakaya, and he says it in a way: this is the path of enlightenment. Why have I been so afraid of pleasure, when in fact pleasure is what I was seeking all along, yet I was afraid of it. And so if we can develop the pleasure of first Jhana and be able to sustain it, then we are on the path, and that path will last us for the rest of our lives. We don't need peak experiences. However, we begin to get those peak experiences. One of those peak experiences could happen when the student realizes that no matter how obstructed the mind becomes, we can clean it out. We gain that confidence, we gain that shraddha, we can do this. And that becomes then an attitude of, "Whoo-hoo, I can do this!" I can do this. That's one of those peak moments that we can do it. And it sometimes brings goosebumps, sometimes energy will rise up the spine, all kinds of things happen because we realize that we can become free from Dukkha. Now, this peak experience that we're talking about, the Pali word for it is Piti. And that if you then start paying attention to how good you feel, then your thought moments are thought moments about feeling, not about discursive thought. You're still thinking, you're still spending mind moments in direct awareness. But the Western mentality begins to think that all that means that you're not having discursive thought, you're not having any thoughts at all. It becomes kind of an empty-headed situation. But the Buddha never taught that as a practice. It actually, even in second Jhana, is not the end of thought. It's just that you're now thinking about how good you feel in this present moment. It's a directedness of the mind, as opposed to no thought at all. So much for the thoughtless. Now another thing that Gigi asked about was illusion, that the Western mentality is, is that everything is an illusion. That's not what the Buddha taught. The Buddha taught Paticcasamuppada, which actually is a system of events. It goes from one dependent state to another dependent state. The word Paticcasamuppada actually means this is dependent upon that, and that the laws of cause and effect is actually known as Iti Apapajayata, that everything is dependent upon something else. Now in there In that Paticcasamuppada, it does talk about perception. What perception actually is, is that when we see something on the outside with the eyes, we hear something, we want to know what it is. We want to know because possibly it might be dangerous. So we become curious, we want to know what it is. And so we make up a story about it. Now, most people do not live in reality. They live in what they call their head. They live in the stories that they tell themselves, not recognizing that it actually is a story. It's not an illusion. It's just a story. And the story may or may not have true elements to it, and that the actual then practice is that we begin to gain skill at our perception, so that how we perceive things is close to what reality actually is. And then later, if we are able to control our perception very well, we can actually stop perceiving and just be in the here-now completely. Because if you have no perception, then you have no feelings at all. This is actually a fourth kind of feeling. There is no such thing as a neutral feeling. As you remember from when we first started talking, there are three kinds of feelings: pleasure, displeasure, and a feeling of not sure. It's a subtle feeling. Maybe it's a mixture, maybe it's neither one, but it almost always rots into don't like him. And now we're introducing a fourth kind of feeling, and that fourth kind of feeling is no feeling at all. We're just there seeing things the way that they are. Without much changing. This is because we have fully developed perception, but we don't want to stay in that state. This is a temporary state also. Can you imagine somebody driving down the freeway in fourth jhana? If I was a cop, I'd bust them for DUJ, driving while under jhana. Why? Because if they're in the jhana, they're not perceiving that car that just drove up, including they're not even able to see the cop behind them as a cop. They're not making that story connection. All they see is just light colors flashing. So we don't spend much time in these higher states. Well, what's the point of them? The Buddha says there's not much point to them, but there is one particular point, and that is he called them pleasant abidings. They're really nice states to be in. But the first Jhana is also a really nice state to be in. And yet the Westerners, they want these deep states of meditation. They think that if they go deep into meditation, that somehow or another, that the deep state of meditation will burn off their old bad Kamma, just like the Jains did. But that doesn't happen. In fact, we could say that deep states of meditation that the Westerners are so fond of is not Jhana at all. Why? Because the first Jhana is absolutely overloaded with pleasure. And yet they don't teach pleasure at all. So how can they go into jhana states that are full of pleasure, having pleasant abidings? No, the states that they go into that they call jhana— actually, a better word for it would be Vipassana jhanas, because it's got no joy, no pleasure built into it. It's much more like a trance state.

**Speaker C:** State.

**Speaker A:** It's not pleasurable. And so this is also a way of saying it's not the path. So deep states of meditation is not the path. Vipassana also— the word Vipassana is a Pali word, but you do not find it in the early suttas. The place where it is found is in the Anguttara Nikaya where it is trying to make sure that you understand to not put any emphasis upon Vipassana. One example of the sutras there is that it says if you have Vipassana, stop developing that and develop Samatha. If you have Samatha, stop practicing that and take on Anicca. But if you have neither one, which is the state that almost everyone is in, then develop them both together. There is nothing special about Vipassana. In fact, if you are practicing correctly according to the Eightfold Noble Path, if you see Dukkha as Dukkha, that's the Vipassana. See it and then get out of it immediately. Don't let it chase you down the street and don't put it in your pocket for later analysis. Get out of it immediately. That's all the Vipassana that you need. And you can do that by being in an ordinary state. So you don't need to develop Vipassana. And yet you'll find, oh, half or more of Western Buddhism calls themselves Vipassana meditation. The Buddha never gave a Vipassana meditation. They also call it insight meditation. The Buddha never gave an insight meditation, and in fact, he wasn't really even that big on what we refer to as meditation the way that is taught in retreats. The Buddha never gave a retreat. What did he say? He said, go to the forest, go to the foot of a tree, go to an empty hut. He didn't say go to a meditation hall where it's got 100 people in it. He said go away, go to an empty hut, sit down by yourself, and start examining, looking, investigating what your own mind is doing right now so that you can change it into a state of joy, into a state of satisfaction. Into a state of everything is okay, everything is fine, not a problem in the world. Oh wow, what a relief! Ah, we can relax, got no problems. You know, almost all the problems that you'll ever have in your life, you made up. You don't have to call them delusions. We can just say we made that up. I got several things to talk about in that regard. This week we went to the hospital to get the medical paper. It turns out that it was so easy, we weren't even there for 30 minutes. It was a really easy thing. Mikey went with us and we all had a ball. And then this year, Tam got all the papers for the visa ready. And she just told me the other day, or just yesterday, oh, everything is finished, no problem. You wouldn't believe how much I used to worry about the visas. Oh, we've got to get this paper. Oh, we got to get that paper. Oh, we got to go get that thing over there. We got to get a medical thing. We got to get a certificate. We got to do all this kind of stuff. And guess what? All of the problems were manufactured within the mind. People will actually fret over going to the bank when all you're going to do is deposit money. Easy! So when you practice correctly and you have a lot of pleasure, your life becomes really easy. Everything is okay, not a problem in the world. To finish off, then we can say the path of the Buddha is easy, and as we tread that path, we gain skills, and the skills then make the life really easy. We don't need words like enlightenment, that the word enlightenment, actually you can take it apart and see the word light And light is like shining a light on it. We can see it. If you can see it, then you can drop it. That's the other kind of enlightenment, is that it's not heavy, it's light. Why can it be light? It's because we saw that it was heavy and we set it down. So enlightenment, there's not much to it. And yet the Western guys, they have it as way far away. Oh, it's such a long goal. Way. Oh, you'll never get to be enlightened. And basically what that means is, is that the path becomes impossible and your only possibility then is keep paying that teacher. The Vipassana meditation in the West is designed for failure. If the people did get the Jhana, did get it, they wouldn't need to teach her anymore. They'd say, bye, I'm going to go sit under a tree for the next ever how long, and I don't need a teacher anymore. The same thing is true, by the way, about Western psychotherapy. And that is, is that especially in the 1970s, going along with Fritz Perls and his idea of top dog and underdog, they begin to do things like pillow bashing, getting your anger out in counter-groups and counter-therapy, and other things like that, which was very much like the Jain self-flogging themselves. Psychotherapy began to say, wait a minute, it's really nice for the psychotherapist to feel all joyful and have a big ego, because she can get her clients to, uh, cathart. Except that the problem is, is that if you can get that man, uh, the family man who has been keeping it in or whatever, not letting it out, and he goes to the psychologist and the psychologist teaches him to beat a pillow, guess what? He's going to go home and beat his wife. And so the psychology began to figure out that this pillow bashing, this encounter group stuff, actually had a dark side. At one time, there was industry of batons and boxing kind of helmets and boxing gloves and knee pads and all kinds of stuff so that people could get out their aggressions on each other. Guess what? That entire industry has folded. Nobody makes that equipment anymore because the psychologists know that making people emote is not the right way to do it. But why hasn't the Vipassana group learned that? Why do they still get pleasure, the teachers get pleasure, in seeing their students fall apart, have dark nights, get frustrated, when in fact all they need to do is just to forget all about it and feel good. So the teaching of the Buddha is still not taught in Western meditation. They don't want it. They don't want people to become free and happy because they'll lose their business and the whole show will fall apart. It's better then that— and it's been a history throughout all of history The teaching from a senior teacher is given freely to his students, generation after generation after generation. When I went to Wat Suan Mokkh, I could stay there as a layman. They fed me, they didn't hassle me, and eventually I became a monk and stayed a monk for many years. And I kept that. I do not charge money. To any of you. But in fact, I think that you can see that the fact that we don't charge money is a genuine benefit. And yet you go on to some of these groups and they say, oh, well, the teacher's got to eat. The answer is, is that the teacher who has to eat is now more interested in eating than he is in spreading the Dharma. So if you've got a meditation teacher who has to eat, leave him. He's not going to be good for you because he's going to provide— he's going to be providing his food on your back. But if that teacher is already satisfied, has everything that he needs, then he's going to be sharing the Dharma for free. This is the way of the, uh, of the monks. Now One of the last things that I'll say about this is that Western monks, there's 200 or more of them. Many of them are in isolated places throughout Thailand. That when I was at Wat Suwan Mok, it's a big wat, and there was another Westerner there. His name is Santi Karo, but we rarely saw each other. Achan Po had me over here and Bhikkhu Buddhadasa had Sankhara way over there. But Achan Chah decided that he wanted to have a lineage of Westerners. And so now you have places like Amravati, Abhayagiri, and Wat Phananachat, which are more like enclaves of Westerners. Well, remember that story I told about 3-year-olds? That's what you have in the Western Sangha of monks is they collect with each other rather than collecting with senior Asian monks. In fact, I can tell that much of what I see as Western Bhikkhus actually have fallen into the Vipassana group. They teach Vipassana because that's what's being taught in the West. So that's where we leave it, is that there is a path, but it's not practiced in the West. So, uh, Gigi just left. Matt, what do you think?

**Speaker D:** Uh, I I'm super grateful that no one's asking for Donna here. Like you said at the end of the talk, I feel like there's something that feels very genuine about that. So I really appreciate that. Other than that, satisfied listening to the talk. Thanks, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** All right. Nicholas, what do you have to say?

**Speaker D:** Good talk. I liked it.

**Speaker A:** The.

**Speaker D:** Part about donations always resonated for me. Because I never, I never did understand why a satisfied man needs more than what he's got.

**Speaker A:** Some of them are making a lot of money off of it.

**Speaker D:** It's a good business.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the funny thing is, is that they're still not satisfied. They go around teaching the teaching of the Buddha but they never teach the real point about being satisfied. Why? Because they're not satisfied themselves. So, Brett, what do you have to say?

**Speaker E:** Enjoyed the talk, friend.

**Speaker A:** You have something extra? Anything more?

**Speaker E:** Nothing more. Nothing comes to mind.

**Speaker A:** All right. Ivan, what do you think?

**Speaker C:** I think much. Enjoy the talk.

**Speaker A:** Anything come to mind?

**Speaker C:** I fell asleep halfway through the talk, so not much.

**Speaker A:** Oh, I hope that that nap was pleasurable.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, very pleasurable.

**Speaker A:** Mr. Ben, what do you think?

**Speaker C:** Thanks for the talk, Dhammarato. Now, the fruits of practice are here and now. Lots of the time people want peak experiences or magical mystical experiences and things that are permanent. All this stuff, but here and now is not important. Like, it's not, it's not. Yeah, there's no extra benefit. Like, yeah, pleasure can feel pleasurable, but beyond that, that just is what it is. There's nothing permanent to it. There's nothing— it doesn't need to be this crazy extreme peak moment. Just being satisfied and content and still is enough. Like, then you just don't want anything else.

**Speaker A:** That is in fact one of the real issues of the Western practice, is people do want an experience. They want a peak experience because they're not satisfied with just taking the next breath happily. They want something special. And the danger is, is then they get something special. They do have a peak experience. It fades away. They go home. And then now what?

**Speaker C:** Now they start chasing it again and again.

**Speaker A:** Right now they want it. Now they've had that peak experience. They want it again and again and again. Chasing experiences.

**Speaker E:** Yet when we practice Anapanasati properly and joyfully, the experience of rising above the irritation of the hindrances, of the Nivarana, I mean, that's pleasurable and that's intrinsically rewarding and Sukkha-inducing in and of itself. And that can occur every time we sit. If we gladden the mind, relax, and link together a few wholesome thoughts, and pay attention to our breath and the kairupa, the proprioceptive feel of body as fabricated by the breath from within, and that's joyful, and that's a joyful abiding if we're absorbed in mindfulness of the body in the here and now. You know, it's fun.

**Speaker A:** That's the whole point, is that we can in fact gain the benefit that the Buddha talked about when we practice according to the teaching of the Buddha. But look at all of these other practices that are not as beneficial. So, Naved, what do you think?

**Speaker E:** Dhammarato, I missed you guys last week, so I'm really glad to be here. Thank you for explaining how this pleasure came first, not the Dukkha. That's what we want to go back to. Also, thank you for explaining the no-thought camp versus what, you know, Buddha actually taught.

**Speaker A:** Yes, the Buddha didn't teach no thought. In fact, it's not possible. Even in all the Jhanas, there is still paying attention, looking at what's there. That in fact, it's the Westerners who practice a going deep meditation that winds up being a trance or maybe a dull state where they do have thoughts, they just don't know that they're having thoughts because they're almost asleep. So, Yanis, what do you have to say?

**Speaker C:** Yanis is not here. I don't see Yanis here.

**Speaker A:** Yannis is not here, he's online. So Alex.

**Speaker C:** What— hey, happy, happy, joy, joy! Everything is okay, everything's all right. I really appreciate hearing, talking about correct practice, keeping it in mind again and again.

**Speaker A:** So Krishna, what do you think?

**Speaker C:** I don't see Krishna. Is Krishna here?

**Speaker A:** I see it on my screen. So Mikey, why don't you take this thing home?

**Speaker F:** Happily. Thanks for being here today, friends, and thanks for the Dhamma talk. Y'all are welcome to stay. You don't have to leave. In fact, let's hang out, make friends with one another. And if you're watching this on YouTube, feel free to come join us. There's a link to join the Dhamma Friends Discord in the video description. And yeah, you can come chat with us here, ask questions, share something about the practice, look at some Dharma-related memes. There's all sorts of things to play with here on the Dhamma Friends Discord. You can also listen to these talks on Spotify and iTunes and other podcasting platforms. And we'd also like to invite you to check out opensanghafoundation.org, where we've got things like our Sangha map, books by Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, talks by Anagami, Anapanasati, and many more resources beyond that to go play with. So yeah, thanks for being here today, friends. Remember, don't worry, be happy. Take care and take it easy.

**Speaker A:** All right, so Now I'm going to go and be happy someplace else. So I'm going to leave you guys here. Don't go away, don't log off, but stay on and make friends with your noble Sangha here. We have a lot of good people who really understand the Dhamma. And if you have any questions or any thoughts, stay on. This has become a tradition that people will hang out for an hour or two even after the talk is over. It's sort of like, uh, going to a concert, and after the concert's over, everybody's still milling around talking to their friends before they go home. So don't leave now, just stay on and, uh, and enjoy each other's company. And I'll go now. Thank you all.

**Speaker C:** Thank you, Dhammarato. Enjoy.

**Speaker D:** Thank you.

**Speaker E:** Thanks, Dhammarato.

**Speaker C:** See you.

**Speaker E:** Guys.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points:

**Core Thesis:** The talk distinguishes the authentic path taught by the Buddha from common misinterpretations in modern "Western Buddhism."

**1. What IS the Path (The Buddha's Teaching):**
*   **Goal:** The end of *dukkha* (dissatisfaction, suffering) through the cultivation of genuine, wholesome pleasure (*sukkha*) and satisfaction within the mind itself.
*   **Method:** The **Eightfold Noble Path**, framed as a practical, moment-to-moment process:
    *   **Remember (Sati):** To be present, pulling the mind away from past/future worries.
    *   **Look (View):** To see clearly what is happening in the mind right now.
    *   **Change:** To skillfully alter unwholesome states into wholesome, pleasurable ones.
    *   **Congratulate:** To nurture the mind by appreciating this ability to change, building confidence (*saddha*).
*   **Key Practice:** *Ānāpānasati* (mindfulness of breathing) as an all-encompassing practice that works with body, feelings, mind, and mental objects to develop joy and relaxation.
*   **The Role of Pleasure:** Seeking pleasure is innate. The path correctly redirects this seeking from unreliable sense pleasures (relationships, possessions) to stable, internal mental pleasure. The **First Jhāna**—characterized by applied thought, sustained thought, and joy/pleasure—is presented as an accessible and sufficient goal for a happy life.
*   **Attitude:** The path is **"good in the beginning, good in the middle, good in the end."** It is meant to be joyful and easeful, making daily life "really easy."

**2. What is NOT the Path (Critique of Modern Interpretations):**
*   **Western Buddhism / Modern Vipassana:** Critiqued as a system "designed for failure" that does not lead to the end of suffering. Its focus on analytically dissecting *dukkha* (like the "16 Stages of Insight") is compared to analyzing dog excrement instead of simply avoiding it. This leads to unnecessary "dark nights" and frustration.
*   **The Visuddhimagga:** The commentary by Buddhaghosa is explicitly rejected as containing errors and not representing the Buddha's core teachings.
*   **Misguided Emphasis on:**
    *   **Pain/Asceticism:** Self-mortification (like the Jains) or cathartic "pillow bashing" in therapy is not the path. Pain doesn't burn off past *kamma*.
    *   **"No-Thought" / Empty Mind:** The Buddha never taught a "no-thought" state. Even in deep *jhānas*, there is directed attention and awareness.
    *   **"Everything is Illusion":** The Buddha taught dependent origination (*paṭiccasamuppāda*)—understanding cause and effect—not that everything is illusory.
    *   **Chasing Peak Experiences / "Deep" Meditation:** The goal is not trance-like states or mystical peaks, but sustainable satisfaction. So-called "*vipassana jhānas*" without joy are not true *jhānas*.
    *   **Commercialization:** The talk criticizes teachers who charge money, suggesting it creates a conflict of interest and perpetuates a system where students don't become truly independent and satisfied.

**3. Historical Context & Corruption:**
*   The pure teaching was diluted after Emperor Ashoka's patronage, when many non-Buddhist ascetics joined the Sangha (analogized to a child being taught by other 3-year-olds instead of adults).
*   This led to the rise of Mahayana and later commentaries that strayed from the original suttas.
*   Modern Western Sanghas often cluster together (like "3-year-olds") instead of learning from senior Asian masters, perpetuating the incorrect "Vipassana" model.

**Conclusion:** The authentic path is simple, joyful, and freely available: remember, look, change, and cultivate inner satisfaction. It is about stepping around *dukkha* immediately, not wallowing in it. The talk encourages finding noble friendship (*sangha*) and teachers who are already satisfied and thus teach without a price.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate their points about the correct Buddhist path versus common misinterpretations. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **The Pen in the Drawer:** Used to explain the three-step process of the path (remember, look, change). Fumbling in a drawer for a pen without looking is futile. You must first *look* (see the problem/pen) to then *change* (pick it up and use it).
2.  **Dog Doodle on the Sidewalk:** A central, vivid metaphor for how to deal with suffering (Dukkha).
    *   **Choiceless Awareness (Wrong Path):** You see it and step right in it.
    *   **Analytical Vipassana/Mahasi Method (Wrong Path):** You take it home, slice it, dice it, analyze it, and eat it—giving you indigestion (the "dark night").
    *   **The Buddha's Path (Right Path):** You see it as what it is and simply step around it immediately. Dukkha is to be seen and avoided, not wallowed in or over-analyzed.
3.  **Enlightenment as "Light":** A wordplay explaining enlightenment not as a distant, heavy goal, but as the act of "shedding light" on something to see it, and thereby making one's burden "light" (not heavy) because you can set it down.
4.  **Driving Under Jhana (DUJ):** A humorous metaphor warning against getting lost in deep, non-perceptive meditative states (which he argues are not true jhana) during practical life, like driving. It highlights that such states are not the goal for daily living.

### **Stories & Analogies**
1.  **The Daycare vs. The Adult Family:** This story explains the historical corruption of the Buddha's teachings.
    *   **The Daycare:** Represents the time of Emperor Ashoka. Many unenlightened ascetics (the "3-year-olds") joined the Buddhist order for material support, and their incorrect practices spread by peer influence.
    *   **The Adult Family:** Represents learning directly from the few truly enlightened teachers (the "adults"). The speaker laments that Western monk communities often resemble the "daycare," where monks learn from each other rather than from senior, accomplished teachers.
2.  **The Visa & Bank Worries:** A personal anecdote to illustrate how most problems are "manufactured within the mind." The speaker recounts how he used to fret over bureaucratic tasks (visas, bank visits) that, in reality, turned out to be simple and easy. The moral is that a correctly practiced mind, focused on present-moment satisfaction, sees life as easy and without unnecessary problems.
3.  **Pillow-Bashing Psychotherapy:** An analogy from 1970s therapy trends to critique certain meditation approaches. Just as psychologists learned that encouraging patients to violently cathart anger (e.g., beating pillows) could lead to real-world harm (e.g., domestic abuse), so too do some meditation teachers mistakenly believe that making students confront and "fall apart" in "dark nights" is productive. The correct path, he argues, is to "forget all about it and feel good."
4.  **The Teacher Who Has to Eat:** A metaphorical critique of teachers who charge money. A teacher who is focused on earning a livelihood ("has to eat") is not truly satisfied and thus cannot genuinely teach satisfaction. A truly satisfied teacher, like a traditional monk, shares the Dharma freely.

### **Overall Rhetorical Purpose**
These metaphors and stories serve a clear dual purpose:
*   **To Clarify the "Right Path":** Making abstract concepts (like right view, dealing with Dukkha) concrete and actionable (e.g., step around the dog doodle).
*   **To Criticize "Wrong Paths":** Vividly caricaturing common Western Buddhist practices (over-analysis, chasing peak experiences, dogmatic no-thought, paid courses) as futile, harmful, or business-oriented deviations from the Buddha's simple, pleasure-centered path.
