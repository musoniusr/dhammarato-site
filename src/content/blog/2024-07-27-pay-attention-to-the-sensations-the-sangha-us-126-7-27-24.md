### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Video recording on now. So welcome to the Saturday Morning Call. Looks like we got 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11 folks on it, uh, and I very much appreciate you guys coming on. Uh, David had a question, I think. Can you repeat your question, David?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I can. I was listening to a Dharma talk by you, and you had mentioned that there are certain skills that we really need to develop to appropriately and skillfully handle discomfort. And so my question is, what exactly are those skills that we should cultivate?

**Speaker A:** Okay, let us start with the answer of the skills to be developed are listed directly by the Buddha. That the first 3 or 4 skills that we'll talk about come as part of the Eightfold Noble Path. And with that, a list of skills that are actually directly specified in the Anapanasati Sutta under the label of, in the quotation, "Thus one trains oneself." Okay. Now, as far as the Eightfold Noble Path, as you know, that fits into the Four Noble Truths. And so in that regard, you could say that working with the Four Noble Truths will gain certain skills. And the first one that I want to talk about is the First Noble Truth. In fact, it's got a lot of skill issues built right in there in the sense of when you have discomfort, what that actually means is you probably have either mental or physical or perhaps some emotional psychological discomforts, which is just another word for Dukkha, just another word for dissatisfaction. That in fact, I'll use it this way. Goenka talks about the difference between the two words sensation and pain. Sensation is what you get. You get sensations through the eyes, you get sensations through the ears, you get sensations through the taste, you get sensations through the olfactory, and you get sensations through the touch. And then with that, the body is touching. There's also a system called proprioceptive And that proprioceptive actually means that you know the position of the body. An example of that is that when you're laying in bed, you know your posture. You don't have to go look at a mirror to see what your posture is, that the only ones who really need to do that are, let us say, ballerinas in training will have a whole lot of mirrors. And the reason that they have is because they're looking for very, very fine detail. But in general, you know, your body's postures, which also means that there is a sensational system that's built really, really deep, as opposed to touch, which is on the surface. All right. That in fact, if somebody's got prostate cancer, that would be part of the proprioceptive feeling system. Because the pain or the sensations are deep in the body. Now, the next point about sensations are that you can say that they're messages. The body has a lot of messages. The neurological system of touch and the body sensations is a message basically to say, stop doing that. So if you're getting the example, I'm not sure of which example that you want to use. So we'll start with the example of students who were practicing meditation and sit too long and the legs go to sleep for lack of circulation, or maybe their legs start to hurt, maybe in the knees. Okay, what the knees are saying is Hey, dude, this is not correct. You're hurting me here, and I'm sending you a message. So if people who are practicing meditation ignore that, they can harm themselves. They can do permanent damage. Okay. Another example of this would be, let us say that you made a mistake and made a gesture that some expert martial artist didn't appreciate. And so what he did was he twisted your hand. And when he twisted your hand in that certain way, it gave you the sensation of you've got to go with him. And so he'll put you on your knees, right? That's because you're going along with it, because you don't like the sensation that the hand is in. So I'll make a short mention of the fact that I know several people, most of them had become ordained monks, who went by that. They didn't pay attention to, they ignored those sensations of the body to the point that they harmed themselves. Several of the people that I know by name You don't hear about him anymore, but way back when, the first one that I knew about was a guy named Bhante Palo, who actually disrobed because he couldn't sit on the floor with the other monks. He wound up in Malaysia someplace at somebody's house. And if you're going to be an ordained monk, the way to do it is by living with other ordained monks. You don't live in somebody's house. You're just a houseguest or a vagrant in that regard, robes or not. And then there's the famous one, Bhante Vilamaramsi. How many of you have ever heard of him? Have you ever seen him sit? The answer is no. That's because he sits only in a chair because he's hurt his legs. Well, actually, he's dead now, and so I can honor him in death. But he was one of those. All right, so you were talking then, uh, David, about ignoring the pain. I just gave you a few people who actually went through life-changing situations because they ignored the pain. So I notice you've got your hand up. Go ahead, I'm listening. And we'll stop now and continue in a moment.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, thank you so much. Since you did ask what kind of example of pain I would like you to use, I would really appreciate it if as much as possible you could use your own example of the medical situation that you have been experiencing as a wonderful dharmic opportunity to practice, as you like to say, that sickness is an opportunity to practice the Dharma. And I think that you have so much wisdom and insight and awareness that we could benefit a lot from how you have been practicing and to learn from your experience.

**Speaker A:** All right. First off, I want to mention Mickey. He's here, Mikey. He's here on the porch and he's been watching that. Go ahead, David.

**Speaker B:** That's all right, just as much as yours as possible.

**Speaker A:** All right, the way to handle it.

**Speaker C:** Is.

**Speaker A:** To pay attention to the sensations. There's a message in there someplace. But the easy way to answer it is that when I'm sitting, even if I'm deeply engaged, say writing PHP code or talking to someone, I'm aware of the sensations of the hip or the foot. And that I can then finish the call, or just when I'm doing something else, I could, right in the middle of it, I can say enough and then get up and go and lay in the bed. That's especially true for the foot, because what— by laying in the bed, that elevates it. Okay, when I'm sitting or standing, all the blood— way too much blood— rushes right down to the right leg. It begins to swell and fill up and get red. And the sensations then is a sensation of heaviness, the sensation of tightness, almost as if what's under the skin is under so much pressure that it's telling the skin that it's tight. I imagine that you've had a bandage on your foot, you know, a wrap, and you know that it feels tight and you want to relieve that. Okay. So basically, we need to pay attention to the sensations. Not saying that it hurts, because hurting means that you don't like it. Now, we are trained from childhood to simply not like it. In fact, babies, they are way more sensitive to sensation. One of the qualities of growing up is that An example of it is that young children have a palate in their mouth of the sensations of the taste of food, and children are especially, let us say, sensitive to bitterness. They don't like gourd things and broccoli and cauliflower and— well, not so much cauliflower, but especially Brussels sprouts and other things like that have a bitter taste to them. And children repel that. But there's DNA right built into that. And that DNA is, is that almost all poisonous plants have a bitter taste. And so over the many, many hundreds of centuries, Humans, basically, you could say that we inherited that quality from apes, that the apes knew what to eat and what not to eat because of the quality of the bitterness, that they would avoid bitterness. And now humans, when they're born, were especially sensitive to bitterness. And so there's Mom with her rules. You have to eat your broccoli before you have dessert. Why make a child develop taste for broccoli? It goes against his nature. In fact, you have probably heard the phrase acquired taste. You can also say that, well, what acquired taste is, is that as we grow up and keep eating the stuff that is overly sensitive, We actually kill off those nerves so that we need more and more and more, for instance, hot, spicy, sweet, salty, other things like that in order to taste the food because we've killed off so much of the stuff on the inside of the mouth by eating things that were inappropriate in the first place. But it was served for lunch. We got no choice, and so we eat things that are not good for us. Okay, so that's an example there of not paying attention and therefore doing ourselves harm. But we've already done a lot of damage already. So now is the time for students to start paying attention to the sensations, the sensations of taste, of smell. Another one would be the sensation of smell. Humans don't have a good smell. Dogs have really excellent smell, but they have a different judgment system than we do. So they'll smell something and they say, hey, I'll have some of that. And humans smell the same thing and may go so far as to vomit because they're repelled by it. Okay, that's another quality, is that humans are in fact sensitive to certain things. And so when we smell it, we know that it's repulsive and we don't want it. So this is another example where people will smell a particular food They don't like the smell of that food. They don't want to eat it. But let us say cultural circumstances or the circumstances of the people around them, they feel compelled to eat it when in fact their body is telling them no, no. Michael, Mickey, can you give a guess as to how to pronounce that guy's name? He had his hand up a minute ago. Yes, Yoonjare Chu, Y-H-U-N-J-U-R-E. Can you hear us? Are you there? Yes, you had a question.

**Speaker D:** Can you hear me?

**Speaker A:** Yes. But you turned your mic off again. Go ahead, turn your mic on. What's the question?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I'm just curious about, like, you're talking about ignoring the pain, right?

**Speaker A:** I didn't catch that. Talking about what?

**Speaker D:** Uh, about ignoring the pain.

**Speaker A:** Is that— yes, denying the pain. That's what this whole talk is about, and I've got other things to say.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, but like, isn't, isn't we supposed to like learning that, like knowing that it is The pain, right? It's about— it's not— it is about suppressing. I'll be confused.

**Speaker A:** Mikey, can you help me out with what he just said?

**Speaker D:** Let me try.

**Speaker C:** Kabbalah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, he's saying that he's confused about whether you're talking about ignoring the pain or suppressing the pain. He's not sure what you're getting at. Okay, I'm talking about— let me get it really short and clear— that all sensation— you use the word pain. I'm not using the word pain, I'm using the word sensation. The difference between the word sensation and the word pain is that sensation is a reality and pain means we don't like it. And oftentimes when we see it as pain, we don't like the pain, so we just kind of ignore the pain. We don't pay attention to it. But a better thing to talk about would be sensations, no matter where they're coming from, are all messages., and that when we see it as pain, we will often ignore the message. But wisdom says no, pay attention to that message. If something smells repulsive, allow the body to be repelled from it. If something tastes bitter, take it out of the mouth. For instance, bitter, sour. An example of that is that if you eat sour cream, it can make you sick. Depends upon what made it sour. For instance, you can buy sour milk and they've got the right kind of stuff in it so it can be sour and you can eat it. But if you let milk sit in the refrigerator and grow sour, it's better to throw it out. It's repulsive. All right, so this is what I'm getting at, and I've got some more to say about it, but let's clear this point up because we're talking about the easy way of looking at it, and that is with sensations of the body. Pay attention to what the body is telling you. This is a major part of the practice of Anapanasati in the sense of In the Anapanasati Sutta, it talks about watching the breath, watching the body breathe in and out, which means start paying attention to the sensations of the breathing. Then the next stage is talking about it in the sense of thus one trains oneself we actually begin to investigate the body. Now, in the Goenka method, they make it a formal kind of practice called body scanning, and it has value. But the Buddha did not talk about that. He talked about it in the sense of watching the body as it's moving, when the breath is moving, when your hands are moving, when your face is moving, When there are sensations, pay attention to it. If there is a slight breeze, know that there is a slight breeze. When there is wind, notice that too. Another example, and I'm sure that you guys will just touch on this point, and that is barometric pressure. Do you guys know what barometric pressure means or air pressure? An example of it is that Uncle Pete, he says it's going to rain because his knee hurts. What that means is that his knee is sensitive to the barometric pressure. Now, what barometric pressure in that regard is, is that when the hot air is on the surface in your area, then it becomes heavy. It becomes heavy and laden. And then when the wind begins to blow, actually, as the heat rises, as the heat rises because of the heat, then cooler air will come rushing in on the surface from out at sea or from other places. And that means that the pressure of the air.

**Speaker C:** Reduces.

**Speaker A:** They have these barometers on board ships. They're almost necessary to have a barometer on board ship to keep track of the barometric pressure, because storms at sea can arise immediately, and it happens because of the change of the barometric pressure. How many of you are sensitive to barometric pressure so that you'll know when it's about to rain 5 or 10 minutes before it starts to rain? Anybody there? Yeah, Mikey. All right, he's from Oklahoma, so they need that. When the wind starts sweeping by the plains, it's time to figure that out. Okay, so, uh, Jung, you got your hand up again.

**Speaker D:** Uh, yeah, um, it just I have been into meditation for a while. I noticed that, for example, like for the human, right? Like sometimes we have the sensation of the fear, but in reality it's not really dangerous. I also want to know like How do we overcome that kind of sensation?

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Mikey, can you translate what he said?

**Speaker C:** I'm.

**Speaker A:** Sorry. You're talking about overcoming the sensation of fear, is that what you said?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, like maybe when you were a child, you don't like to eat some vegetable, and then you grow up and that vegetable is okay to eat, but you still have the sensation before, the same one that you had when you were a child.

**Speaker A:** Actually, that could be a holdover. It's not a sensation that's new from, let us call it, mental memory. It can actually be muscle memory. That you didn't ever get over. You didn't kill off all the taste buds because you ate that food and became used to it. But in fact, that's a good way of talking about it. When you get used to something, that meant you killed off nerves. When you get used to something, that means that you're doing some kind of damage, because the better thing to do is to remain sensitive to these messages. But a lot of the nervous system is going to die off in age anyway. It happens all through our life, but it begins to get really noticeable when you get close to 80 years.

**Speaker C:** Old.

**Speaker A:** For instance, the nervous system part of the cochlea in the ear, which is responsible for keeping and maintaining your balance, When I was a young man, I remember impressing people when we were actually in Kandy, for the Kandy Perahera in Sri Lanka. And there is a river outside, and that river has great big boulders in it, a lot of boulders. And I could jump from boulder to boulder to boulder with ease because I had a good balance system. And that balance system came because of the training that I had with band. We had one of those fancy bands where people are— it wasn't exactly a jigaboo band, but it was having to do with a lot of marching and movements and bowing and doing all kinds of stuff. Another example of that is to train in sports. And dance and other things to where people can train that balance system. But now in old age, I don't have near the balance that I used to have. I can tell that it's waning in old age. And so that's an example of— with many examples, our taste buds are not as sensitive in old age. One of the things about that you can tell is, is that old people, you might know this, don't eat as much. That's because there's a whole lot of work and there's not much value because it doesn't have much taste anymore. So they eat food and what's the point? They've got to chew and chew and chew with bad teeth and they're not getting any enjoyment out of it. And so they wind up not eating so.

**Speaker C:** Much.

**Speaker A:** So over time, we lose our sensitivity unless we actually train ourselves in sensitivity. And this is going back to what Goenka was talking about, is that we need to become sensitive to the body. An example of that is, is that if a mosquito lands on your arm It's better to know that the mosquito has landed on your arm, otherwise you're going to get bitten. And if that bite feels like pain, you want to get rid of it, often killing the mosquito while his nose system is still embedded in your arm, including all the bacteria or whatever. So when you kill a mosquito while it's biting you, you're actually doing yourself harm. The better thing to do is to blow the mosquito away, or light a mosquito coil, or put some ointment on that the mosquitoes don't like so that they don't come near you and bite you in the first place. But if they do bite you, then invite them to leave. But if you kill them you're going to probably have a whelp. And if you don't like the sensation that they've left, then you'll probably scratch, which then means that you're irritating the skin, all because you don't like the sensation of the mosquito. And in that regard, all that I'm talking about then is lack of awareness, lack of paying attention. So how do we train with this is through Anapanasati, is to become familiar with the body. Watch what your hands are doing, watch what your posture is. Some of you have probably heard of the little phrase rising, falling, touching, sitting. This is a phrase that comes out of Burma. Rising means the rising of the chest for breathing in. Falling means the collapse of the chest and the body when you're breathing out. Paying attention to this. Touching means that you know the touch of the cloth, you know the wind, you know the experience of the touch. And then the sitting is actually back to that proprioceptive system that I mentioned. All right, so now that we've fairly covered the body, we can make— we can leave it off with the final point, and that is thus one trains oneself to relax the body, which means to make the body comfortable. To relax the body and make it comfortable, that's what the teaching of the Buddha is, is that We're not going to avoid pain. We're going to eliminate the pain. In other words, if we're uncomfortable, being uncomfortable— that's the word you use, David— is the same thing as being dissatisfied. So the thing to properly do would be is to get the body comfortable and then there is no problem. Now, that also happens mentally. It also happens emotionally or feeling system. And it also happens with our attitudes. Now, these four things: the body, the mind as an attitude, the state of mind that we're in, the actual thoughts that we have. And the way that we feel. This is called the Satipatthana, the four foundations of mindfulness. Now, the word mindfulness here is actually a translation of the word Sati. And so what we can say is, is that the word Sati in this case actually means to remember to pay attention, to remember to look. To remember to experience the body, to remember to experience what mind states that you've got, to remember what your thoughts are, and to remember to be aware of the way you feel. All right, uh, young who, I guess— how do you say your name?

**Speaker D:** Uh, uh, just, just call me, uh, how do I say this, Yang.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, all right. Yeah, yes, I've got a Yang for your Yen.

**Speaker D:** I'm actually Thai people, it's just so—.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so where are you from? What, what— you have a heavy accent in English. What language is your, uh, Native language? I'm Thai. Thai? Oh, put Thai Dhamma. Okay, show you.

**Speaker D:** It's really funny because as Thai adult, we were growing up to study Buddhist teaching and it never goes into my head. Just until like I'm starting to listen to you and talk with other people who also joined this, which helped me a.

**Speaker A:** Lot. Actually, in Thailand they have a thing called Buddha Satsang, and Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about it in two ways, in the sense of it's the Buddhist religion of the masses, which has a whole lot of religion built into it, including ceremonies and, uh, tambun and, uh, a whole lot of stuff that is actually not the teachings of the Buddha. And I, uh, am especially pleased that you're coming out of the Thai religion and coming into the teachings of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa as he is teaching the actual teachings of the Buddha, and the real teachings of the Buddha basically is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha—to be able to see the Dukkha and to come out of it. So, if we can see the body is uncomfortable, then we can make the body comfortable. If we do not see the body as uncomfortable, then we're unlikely to make it comfortable. We'll put up with it, we'll ignore it, we'll actually do more harm because we're not paying attention to the body. But the whole point in Anapanasati, in the Kayanupassana, is in part of the body, the whole point of Watching the breathing, slowing it down, getting the body comfortable is so the body can relax. Now I'll just make a little survey here. How many people would prefer to be uncomfortable or to be relaxed? Anybody here vote for relaxation? Relaxed. Yeah. Okay. A lot of votes for relaxation. Exactly. So this is the teaching of the Buddha, is to get to know the body very well with the intention of using that knowledge to relax. So if the leg is hurting because the student is sitting too long in a meditation class, the right thing to do is to relax that posture. That at the retreats at Wat Soan Mokkh, they only have retreats for 30 minutes, not an hour. And in that time, they still give the students the instruction that if your body starts to pain, if you've got back pain, if you've got leg pain, then the right thing to do is actually adjust your posture, even to the point of standing up. And that doesn't eliminate it, then go outside and do some walking practice, walking meditation. In other words, do what you need to do to relax, to take the discomfort away. And yet you'll find retreats like Goenka's and to some degree Mahasi. They want you to sit in pain in order to, I don't know why, get used to it. The little joke that I have is that the strong determination settings that goenka have, I can only think of two kinds of people who should have that kind of practice. One would be CIA agents who are going to the Taliban and are likely to get caught and tortured. If you can handle torturing yourself, then you can handle getting tortured by the Taliban. I don't recommend that you join the CIA. I don't recommend you get caught by the Taliban. And I certainly don't recommend you sitting in meditation, training yourself to handle and manage pain by ignoring it. That the right way to handle things is letting your body become comfortable. Now, that's a really good lead-in to the next part of it, and this is an important part. How many of you have heard about Dukkha and coming out of Dukkha? But in our Western frame of reference, they think of, well, I should not have any Dukkha. How many of you have had that point? That's a little rule that we have. Oh, you shouldn't have Dukkha. You shouldn't have it, right? What that means is, is that when you do have Dukkha, you want to ignore it, you want to deny it. But that's not at all what the Buddha taught. He taught instead is to get to know the Dukkha, not get rid of it in the sense of you're supposed to not have any. Because if you have the idea of, oh, I'm not supposed to have any Dukkha, then you're not able to deal with it correctly. Going back to the example of sitting in meditation with the leg pain, oh, I'm supposed to sit here. I'm supposed to do that. I've got a rule here. I'm supposed to put up with that. Sensation. I'm supposed to be able to tolerate that sensation. And when we do that kind of thing, we're putting ourselves in danger. The same thing is true when we deny mental dukkha, emotional dukkha, attitudinal dukkha. Whenever we have any discomforts, mental discomforts, Let us say an example of that is that when somebody is practicing Anapanasati, they're practicing it correctly, and all of a sudden a thought, maybe a thought of cruelty, a thought of not liking comes up, and then they see that thought, they say, oh, I'm not supposed to have that kind of thought. Oh me, I have failed. See, what they're doing with that is they're going deeper and deeper into dissatisfaction and denying it at the same time. The right thing to realize is that our job is in fact to be alert to the Dukkha that is going to come. The Buddha does not say eliminate Dukkha. He says when you have Dukkha, See it correctly so that you can then do something about it. Just like with the leg pain, when you see that your leg is in pain, do something about it. For instance, me sitting here and the leg begins to swell and hurt because I'm sitting up too long. The right thing to do is to walk to the bed and lay down, raise the the— elevate the leg so that it will stop hurting. It's a messenger. That tightness and heat that is felt in the foot, that is a message. And we need to pay attention to these messages. That's the whole point. If you can understand that, then you can understand that this is the correct way of practice. And yet several of you raised your hand, "Oh, you're not supposed to have Dukkha." If you have the attitude you're not supposed to have it, that means that you're going to ignore it when it's there. In a way, you're going to lie to yourself about it. But in fact, that's what we do all the time. Whenever we lie, it's because we have some rule, "You're not supposed to do that," And, oh, I'm following the rule, I'm not supposed to do that, therefore I say I did not do it, when in fact it happened. So if we can change the rules, that's the whole point. Then in fact, the Buddha talks about this in the sense of it's a fetter, it's a canker, it's a bondage that we're in, is all of the rules that we made. How many rules do you have, David? I would estimate probably more than 100,000, maybe 100 million different rules. Look how many rules are associated just with the English language, never mind all of the rules about polite language. Okay, and so we have all of these— go.

**Speaker C:** Ahead.

**Speaker B:** It's just hilarious because when you asked me what rules I have, the first thing that I thought of was English grammar rules because I'm an English teacher. So it is absolutely amazingly synchronistic that you mentioned English.

**Speaker A:** Rules. That happens a lot. Another example is, is that I use dishwashing Just this plate. Have fun rubbing this plate and making it clean and setting it down. Guess what? The guy then says he's a professional dishwasher. Other things, like I mentioned a particular song and the woman is blown away because that particular song is still on her phonograph. They just played it. Okay, why that happens, I'm not sure, and I don't care, but I really get a big kick out of the fact that things are in tune. They're in synchronicity. The better word that I like is serendipity. So anyway, yes, we have tons and tons and tons of rules, and one of the rules is you're not supposed.

**Speaker C:** To dot, dot, dot.

**Speaker A:** All right, and in this case we're talking about you're not supposed to have, uh, to have leg pain. Don't ignore— I mean, ignore that pain. Just sit. You're told to sit, so you're following the rules. And by doing that, you're putting yourself into grave danger because you're not listening to the reality of the message of the leg. The same thing is true about the idea of you're not supposed to have Dukkha. If you're not supposed to have it, then we begin to ignore it. The right thing to do is to pay attention to what we're thinking, to pay attention to our attitudes and our moods. In fact, we could start with that one and work with it first. Our attitude is almost always the attitude of I'm a victim. We play the blame game. It's somebody else's fault, or I need help from someone. Look how much that's built into our system. We need doctors, we need lawyers, we need automobile mechanics, we need accountants, we need a mommy, we need a daddy, we need a God, we need a religion, we need all kinds of things, down to, I need a therapist, I need a guru, I need a meditation master. I need, I need, I need, I need is built right into our attitude. And the first kind of doubt to get over is to finally recognize nobody's going to help you. You've got no help coming. All you have is information. But if old fat man Dhammarato gives you information, you're the one who has to put it to work. He's not going to make you feel better. That's your choice. He can howl with laughter and enjoy himself, and you can watch him and still be miserable. Up to you. It's not up to the teacher. It's not up to the guru. That's why I would rather prefer you guys to see me as a friend rather than as a teacher or a guru. I'm just a friend. I can't fix you. Gurus are those who do the doobie-gummy-gummy— oh, I got a guru, he's going to fix me. He's not. He's not going to fix you. The accountant is not going to fix you. You can get the accountant to do your IRS forms, and then you can take them home and sign them and change them and lie to the IRS even after the accountant fills it out. But most people, especially the rich ones, they lie to the accountant before he fills out their income tax forms. All right, so the accountant is not going to keep you out of trouble. Your lawyer is not going to keep you out of trouble if you lie to him. This is the whole point, is, is that This is in fact what I'm talking about here, is the Second Noble Truth. The Second Noble Truth is that you create your own Dukkha. Nobody hurts you at all. For instance, if the body sensation is of tightness, of swelling, of heat, and you don't like it, you call it pain. That's your choice.. Or you can see the tightness and the swelling as a message and say, oh, the foot is talking to me. I got to go do something about it. So the way that the Second Noble Truth is phrased is in English, they call it greed, ill will, and ignorance. How many of you have heard those words? Greed, ill will, and ignorance. That's not a really good definition, by the way, of the Second Noble Truth. A better way of looking at it is liking and not liking and delusion, denial, deception. We don't like it and we lie to ourselves about it. Okay? So, I like it, I don't like it, and I'm confused is a better way of thinking about the Second Noble Truth. And guess what? That didn't come from the outside. A really quick example is a tsunami, an act of God. How many of you would say, oh, I'm a victim of the tsunami? You're out on the beach there in Patia. I'm thinking about specifically December 2004, and there was a huge earthquake out in the Adriatic. Or the Indian Ocean. And all the Western tourists were standing on the beach saying, oh, look at it go out, oh, look at it come in, and then they get washed away. And then they say, oh, it was an act of God. No, here's the important point about this, is that on Phuket, all of the elephants headed for the hills because they could feel the sensations and the vibrations of the earthquake. And so when they headed for the hills and the beach gets washed away, the elephants are okay. They're paying attention. But it's the partygoers who are out on the beach that weren't paying attention. So which is the point then? Is— was it the tsunami that washed them away, or was it their own denial and ignorance that washed them away? If you can see it that way, then you recognize that everything that ever happened to you that you didn't like, you created it. No one is going to help you. No one has ever helped you out of your Dukkha, out of your suffering, out of your dissatisfactions, out of your discomforts. Only you can help you. Now, little children have a little trouble with that because they don't I have the skills. But as we grow up, especially if you're beginning to get the Buddha Dharma, you begin to recognize you've got some skills that need to be developed. And one of the most important skills then that needs to be developed is to take responsibility. Nobody's going to help me. This is all up to me. It didn't happen that way. Okay, that in fact you can see some of the major politicians in the United States right now— hint, hint— blame other people, completely in denial. It's not his fault, it's always they did it to me. Okay, that will leave you in a state of misery. You will be uncomfortable and unhappy and angry until you recognize that all your troubles, all your sorrows, all your stuff is self-manufactured. And most of it is that attitude of being a victim. So what do we do now? We begin to change that attitude to the attitude of, oh, it's up to me. So that brings in the second kind of doubt. And that is, are you up to it? Can you handle this? Are you good enough? And the answer to that is, develop the skill that you can handle it. You can be satisfied. You can be successful with the right training. And then the next point, the third level of doubt, is, do I have the right tools to do it? I can have the right attitude that I can do it. I have the right attitude, I could build a house, but I don't have any cement, don't even have a hammer. Okay, so in this regard, we can say that the tools that we need is the teaching of the Buddha. We need to use the tool to develop the skill to use those tools. And what are the tools? The Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Noble Path, and the practice of Anapanasati. And when we have those, we can in fact then begin to make the change that needs to be made. So the way to make these changes, again, we're talking about the Satipatthana, the four foundations of mindfulness. If we have an unwholesome thought, we can change that thought to a wholesome thought. If we can see that we have the attitude of a victim, we can change that attitude to the attitude of a winner. If I'm in the state of feeling of not liking it, I can change that to either liking it or making it neutral. And if the body is uncomfortable, I can adjust and move the body. All of these things, by the way, are built on the change model. And you can't change it if you can't see it. But if you can see it, you could do something about it. So this is actually then going from the Second Noble Truth to the Third Noble Truth, and that is you can do something about it. You can become comfortable in the body by making the change. You can come out of your unwholesome thoughts into wholesome thoughts and change your mind. You can come out of your victim's attitude into the winner's attitude and change your attitude. You can change your feelings eventually so that you can feel the way you want to feel. An example is that you see the mosquito on your arm. Instead of not liking it, you can say, "Oh, go away, mosquito," instead of killing it. But if you don't like it, you're full of hate and anger, You kill that mosquito, you may leave half of the mosquito under your skin, which is going to cause a big whelp. So these four foundations of mindfulness are actually the whole point. Now, I know, David, that you started the question about bodily discomfort, and now you're recognizing, oh no, you're much more complete than that. It's not just the body. It's our mind, our mind states, and the way that we feel. And we got to start paying attention to all four of those things. And with Anapanasati, the very first place to start is with our unwholesome thoughts, to begin to see that if I've got an unwholesome thought, I can change that thought if I can see it. And so the practice then is with the Eightfold Noble Path is to wake up and take a look at these thoughts we're having. We can wake up and take a look at our attitude. We can wake up and take a look at the way we feel, just like we can wake up and pay attention to the body, listen to the body. So if the swelling is like in the early days, Wow, the foot was so big and so swollen, I recognized I've got to go to the hospital. And so I went to the hospital. In the hospital, by the way, for 9 days. And so the doctor thought that I was really needing to be in the hospital too. So he at least agreed with me on that. But it wasn't him that healed me. It was my attitude that I'll get over this. A lot of people can go to the hospital, "Oh, poor me, I don't feel good anymore," and they die. People can die over the dengue fever. But you can change your attitude to the attitude, "I'll handle this, I'll get over it." That's the attitude that we have to change, so that we stop blaming my misery on my foot, or blaming my misery on the doctor, are blaming my misery over whatever bug it was that gave me the disease. It's not their fault. It's always mine, and I can handle this disease. The same thing is true in intellectual stuff. Writing code, it's not the compiler's fault that I keep forgetting to put the semicolon at the end of the line. You know, I was raised in Fortran where the end of the card was the end of the line. But in PHP, you have to end the statement with a semicolon. And I make that statement, or that error, often. But I know it when I see it. Aha, I know what's wrong with that. Let me go find where I left my semicolon out. So as a matter then of, can you change your attitude instead of, oh, poor me, my code doesn't work, oh, poor me, my website's broken, or oh, poor me, my flat that tire. Okay, so here's another example. Let me give you this example, and then, David, I'll give you a chance. Okay. Imagine that you're driving down the road and the tire has low pressure. A sensitive driver will know that his left rear tire is deflated. So what is he going to do? He's going to pump it up. This is what we need to do with Anapanasati, is when you feel deflated, pump yourself up. Now some people will let the tire go completely flat, and then they've got a lot of pumping to do. This is your ordinary person. But then some people will not only let the tire go flat, but they'll keep driving, and then the tire begins to get loose on the rim, they can tear up the tire. Right? A lot of people do that with their mind. They get their mind so deflated that their mind just comes off and destroys the tire. Now it's going to get expensive. You got to buy a new tire. But then some people will continue driving. Then, in fact, you probably haven't seen it in reality, but you've seen videos of people who are driving now, and they're on the rim making sparks, and they keep driving. They're not paying attention to the fact, and if they had paid attention to the fact that their tire was low, they could have pumped it up. If they paid attention to the tire is flat, they could do something about it. But they continued to drive, and now the tire is ruined, and then they'll continue to drive, and now they're on the rim, and they destroy the rim, they destroy the bottom part of the car, because they're not paying attention, or they're ignoring it. In fact, most of the time when people are driving on the rim and worse is because it doesn't matter. They got to get away from the cops. And so they're driving and driving and driving even down on the rim and not recognizing, hey, if I'm on the rim, the cops are going to stop me. I can't escape from the cops if I'm driving on the rim. But look how they get into denial. Okay, so many people live their lives like that. You could go so far as to say, using psychological language, is that unhappy people have low pressure. Then you have neurotics that have a flat tire. And then you have really crazy people that are out destroying the tire, and then you have schizophrenics that are riding on their rim. Okay, they need a whole lot more help than just pumping it up. And guess what? They can't get that help. Their pills don't work. So this is a way of looking at it. Now, David, you have your hand up, so.

**Speaker B:** Go ahead. Yes, this has been extremely helpful so far. I have two questions. First one is just a real quick— I missed it while I was writing down the first two. You mentioned that there were three specific kinds of doubt that really keep us from taking responsibility, and the first one was, "Who is gonna save me from this?" Yeah, the victim position. Am I good enough to.

**Speaker C:** Do this?

**Speaker A:** Am I apt? The third one is, do I have the right tools to do it? Do I have the right tools? Okay. That in the suttas, by the way, it is stated as this third level of doubt is knowledge and vision of what is and what is not the path. Most specifically, what is and what is not the Eightfold Noble Path, the Noble Path. For instance, following the rules. A lot of, let us say, religions are into, you got to follow the rules, you got to do tombun, you got to keep the precepts, you got to keep the Ten Commandments, you got to keep the Sharia law. Well, guess what? There's an awful lot of people who follow the Sharia law, and they're possibly the most miserable people in the world. They want a jihad, they want a caliphate. We've got rules here, you know, right? And so miserable people are the ones who think that the path is following the rules. Actually, the way to look at it is, is that when you practice correctly and change your attitude using the Eightfold Noble Path correctly, and begin to have the winner's attitude to where you don't want anything anymore, you're satisfied, your mind is together, your mind is well organized, your mind is unified, and you are happy as a clam. Then if you don't want anything, you're unlikely to go out and kill somebody to get it. If your mind is unified and healthy then you're unlikely to go out and kill and take it. If your mind is healthy and unified and you don't want anything, you're unlikely to lie. We lie because we're in denial, because we've broken some rule. That's the reason why people lie, is because they want something and they've broken a rule that will prevent them from getting it. And therefore we got to lie. Oh, I didn't break that rule.

**Speaker B:** Right, they're not taking responsibility. And this is the major point here that I'm taking away from this talk is that, you know, and I really— it helps a lot that you actually said, oh, well, it doesn't matter like where the bug came from, who sneezed where, or whatever, because that's just looking for another person to blame, and that's shifting away the responsibility of whatever sensations that I have in the moment. And so Since I'm elsewhere and not being present, I'm really not being of much benefit to myself whatsoever. So you want to complain about pain? Well, how about we look right here, right now and deal with that first and not look at it as pain, which is to say that it's something that we really don't like. So all of this is really, really helpful. And we have to have a really strong attitude and we have to have the right effort. And I feel like that's just the answer to the next part that I'm going to say. Which is like, you know, you realize, do I have the tools? And you said, no, I don't have the tools to deal with this sickness. I need to go to a hospital. And like you said, the doctor agreed. So there's a middle path in all of this. But as you're sitting there doing, taking responsibility in the hospital for yourself, there's a lot of sensation that you were experiencing. And so it's just continuing to have the right effort and the right attitude of saying, yep, I'm doing everything I can, and I'm going to continue to do everything I can to relax this and to be aware of the messages. And I'm gonna build the skills, gosh darn it, because that's it.

**Speaker A:** Is that it? Yes. And I'll add something to that. What you said is correct. Now, I'll add one thing to it. Imagine yourself laying in the hospital bed with 3 different IVs and taking blood 4 or 5 times a day, that in fact all the veins and all the arteries were hiding. When they saw that nurse come in, everything disappeared. They tried to take blood out of my wrist, out of the normal place in your elbow. They would even go after the foot, the left foot, not the right foot. I imagine if they had gone for the right foot, they could have gotten all the blood they wanted. It's just not the blood that they wanted. But here's the point. With all of the sensations over and over and over again, especially when there was no nurses there, only IVs, the thoughts come. And what are the thoughts? You know, I'm going to get over this. Everything is all right. Yeah, the website can wait. I've got a lot of friends. I could just lay here without any worries and I'm okay. And over and over and over again, all 9 days of it, it was like a retreat. Okay, and the retreat is everything's okay, I'll manage this, the doctor will finally set me free, I won't even be well then, but he'll eventually discharge me and I'm all right, the website can wait, I've got nothing planned that I can't wait on. Wow, let me just lay here and enjoy. Get that? Let me just lay here and just enjoy. Oh, this is so nice. Oh, I can relax. I'm in the hospital. Oh, everything is all right. Everything that I had planned can wait. No worries. No place to go. Literally no place to go. And literally nothing to do. There was not even any internet. No Wi-Fi. Everything is okay. Everything is fine. So that's the way to practice. Now, in that regard, if I had not already been skilled in that practice, like most people in the hospital— how many people in the hospital can just relax and say everything's okay, everything is fine? Oh no, the mind is churning and spinning and worried and frustrated. The hospital patients are pretty miserable people. Can you be in the hospital and be relaxed? All right, everything's okay. Yeah, the foot's up, these big— it's swell, it's double the size. In fact, uh, uh, Mikey can attest to that. You remember when I was going to the hospital trying to put the shoes on? How swollen that foot was. Yeah, it was big balloon. In fact, part of the process of the healing is the old dead skin would itch. Huge amounts of skin were coming off. So, dang. Go ahead, you got your.

**Speaker C:** Hand up.

**Speaker D:** Uh, just if, uh, it's just, it's.

**Speaker A:** Like.

**Speaker D:** When I'm, oh, I think I'm having time to process what you're telling me. It's just, yeah, like, like, like, first, like, I want to tell you that.

**Speaker C:** Like.

**Speaker D:** I use Actually, I come and join this call because I do want some help. But you say something that, like, for example, the rule. Because the thing is, I have.

**Speaker A:** The.

**Speaker D:** Sensation of, for example, my sensation to my parents is really highly sensitive and it's like really intense. And then I'd be like, I'm not supposed to have that. I shouldn't have it, right? Like, I'm not supposed to be like, oh, I'm so scared to talk to my parent that I— and then I dislike the sensation because I'm really sensitive. Logically, like, if you think like that, you You're gonna be like, "Oh, how do I get rid of the sensation?" But you tell me otherwise, like it's not about remove the sensation. Wait, I'm having a hard time to.

**Speaker A:** Remember what you tell me right now. Okay, right. It's not the sensation. We call it pain because we don't like it. And because we don't like it, we want to get rid of it. We want to ignore it rather than paying attention to it and listening to it. And that's the normal way of society. Ordinary Buddhists are like that in Thailand also. But the right way to practice is to pay attention because there's a message in there someplace. And if you can see what's going on, then you have an opportunity to change. That's the important part, is if you can see what's going on, you have an opportunity to do something about it. And if you don't like it and start to lie to yourself about it, guess what? You're stuck with it. You can't change. You're in a state of denial. This is part of the Second Noble Truth, is that when we don't like something, we try to get rid of it. Okay, but in fact, one more point that I'll make, and that is that it's okay to use diversion as a skillful tactic, as a skillful means. For instance, if I'm laying there in the hospital bed while they're taking blood, instead of paying attention to the sensation of that needle poking around trying to find it, the right thing to do is to put my mind in the state of the nurse. Hey, I'm doing this. Let me find that vein. All right, just in other words, I'm paying attention to what the nurse is doing. Rather than paying attention to, 'Oh, poor me, this is so painful,' because all she's doing is just drawing blood. It's only a needle that long. It's not the same as a hypodermic needle that goes all the way into the muscle. She's just there on the surface, but there's a lot of sensations on that surface. And so I will divert the mind from, 'Oh, poor me, my arm hurts,' into, oh, let's explore, let's go find that vein, let's watch what the nurse is doing. So I got my eyes open, I'm watching what she's doing. And in fact, on one of the occasions, one of them that hurt the most, in fact, was because the nurse could not get the— there's a little vial that's got a vacuum on it, and when you poke that, the other end of the needle into the vacuum, the vacuum will help suck the blood out. She couldn't get that going. So what she was doing, she was collecting into the vial blood as it was dripping out one drop at a time. It wasn't being drawn out with a hypodermic. It wasn't with that vacuum tube. She was just letting it drip. And so the next time they came in for blood, I looked at their equipment. You got that little vial that's got the vacuum on it? Let's get one of those. Let's not do it by the drip method. So anyway, that's the whole point, is pay attention to what's going on instead of, oh, poor me, and withdrawing from it into the pain. What you could do instead is actively watch the procedure, divert your attention from unwholesome into the wholesome. If you're having unwholesome thoughts about someone— I'm going to get him back— or maybe he's a terrible politician, wish somebody would shoot him— into the position of, hey, look, I can see what's going on, I know what's happening, isn't that nice that I can see what's going on, and guess what, it doesn't matter what happens in American politics, I'm going to be okay. How many of you have that feeling of your own country, whether you're in America or in Thailand? I mean, the politicians are in Thailand, the politicians are in Malaysia, and all the population is worried about what the politicians are going to do. The answer is you're going to be okay. It doesn't matter what they do. Even if they, the Republicans, come in and start monkeying with Social Security, there's going to be a whole lot of unhappy people that'll deal with it. I don't have to deal with it. Yeah, I can handle on the Social Security being cut. I'm okay. That's the kind of attitude to begin to develop. That takes skill, that it does not matter what happens in politics, you're okay. Does not matter what the wife does, you're okay. So let's go ahead and end this call. This has been a good call. Thank you so much. I'm glad that some of you getting something out of it. Ben, you've been shaking your head up and down. I bet you got a neck pain from all the nodding that you're doing. Do you have any final comments? It was all very illuminating. Yeah, no, it was all good.

**Speaker C:** Thank.

**Speaker A:** You, Dhammarato. How about you, Jordan? You got any.

**Speaker C:** Last remarks? It was interesting hearing like a different way of explaining the same sort of thing of paying attention and then making a change. I like just hearing the different way of explaining it. I was trying to think of a good way of giving advice. I think it was Yen said he had strong sensations towards his parents. He was trying to figure out what to do with it. And the advice that I was sort of trying to come up with was like, the reason you need to pay attention to it and not avoid it is so that you can make a change, because you won't know what change to make unless you're actually paying attention to why you're feeling those sensations. So like, yeah, avoiding it's not going to help, but actually paying attention will allow you to actually know what change to make so that you're not going to be feeling those sensations like forever.

**Speaker A:** Or we can expand that into there is going to be Dukkha. There is— it's going to happen. Don't have little rules about you're not supposed to be unhappy, you're not supposed to be miserable, you're not supposed to be dissatisfied, because it's going to happen. And if it does happen, can you see it so you can change it? You do something about it. So if you're unhappy with your parents, then do something nice.

**Speaker D:** For them. Can I ask you a bit more question?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, the thing I'm curious a bit, how does, like, for example, I have— okay, let's do the family one because it's the actual problem.

**Speaker A:** Like, no, it's not a problem. You don't like it. I don't like— I don't like it. Okay, do you— if you can see that you don't like it, you've got a choice. You called it a problem when in fact the whole idea of it was that you manufactured that problem. There's no problem, you made it up. It's really true. You're blaming them. It's not their fault that you're unhappy. You chose to.

**Speaker D:** Do that. And then like, I decide to do some— to went on to do the separate— the activity that's suppressing the emotion. For example, maybe you're smoking, you're drinking, maybe you're doing something completely like playing games all day, something like that. Is that the same one as the diversion you mentioned? You say that the diversion is okay, right?

**Speaker A:** Yes, healthy, wise diversion as opposed to avoidance. Can you see the difference between avoiding.

**Speaker D:** Versus diversion?

**Speaker A:** Diversion means you've got a choice about moving out of the way, as opposed to avoiding it: "Oh, there's a big truck in front of me, and I don't like that big truck," and I wind up smacking right into the truck. That's what avoidance is, is that you're going to bring to you that which you're avoiding. But if you can wisely divert get out of its way. In other words, if you have the rule, "Oh, I'm not supposed to hate my parents," you're going to continue to hate them. But if you have the idea of, "Oh, look at all of my bad feelings about my parents, let me start to change that," Let me give them a gift. Buy your dad a pen. Buy your mom some needle and thread. We don't have to spend a lot of money. It's the thought that counts. And can you have happy thoughts? Can you appreciate what your mom and dad are doing for you? Because they do both good and bad. And when you're thinking about the bad things that they're doing, You're doing yourself harm and them. So if you start paying attention to what they're doing correctly, then you can begin to enjoy them. That's another way of talking about the diversion. Start looking for the good in them. For instance, if your dad is yelling at you, Probably he's yelling at you because he really cares. So you can say, Dad, thank you so much for caring about me. I know how much you care because look how loud you're talking. Instead of, I don't like him yelling at me, we can say it— you can divert that into, well, he's yelling at me because he cares about me. Thank you for your love and caring and attention, Daddy. Guess what? He may stop yelling. But if you argue with him and tell him no, he's going to keep yelling. The best way to stop an argument is by agreeing with the person. So begin to be agreeable. Agree with your mom and your dad. I mean, that's Thai culture anyway. So begin to be a Thai. Fit in. Begin to like what's happening. You've got a choice, you know. Up to you. But if you want it my way, then you'll always wind up on the highway. That in fact, there is a statement in the Ten Commandments. How many of you have heard this? Let me see if I can quote it directly. Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long on the land that the Lord thy God giveth thee. Is that the way to say it, Mikey? Yeah. Honor your father and your mother, or they're going to kick you out of the house. Honor your father and your mother, or they're going to yell at you, going to make being at home difficult. Honor your father and your mother. They, they have put so much into you. They've raised you. I mean, look, you're an adult. You're a big happy fat man. That's because they cared about you. If they didn't care about you, you would have been abandoned. You'd have been thrown in the— uh, Cha Phra, you would have been thrown in the river. You would have been thrown in the klong. No, they kept you. They cared about you. Isn't that wonderful? They still take care of you. So congratulate them for doing such a marvelous job. Your dad yelling at you has been quite beneficial to you. Appreciate him for that. In other words, change your attitude. You feel like a victim to them instead of you're the winner here. You can show them gratitude, show them your generosity, show them your caring back to them. They'll appreciate it. Can you remember to do that? You need to develop that as a skill, to remember that you're okay, that they didn't screw you up, they raised you up, and you're good enough just like you are. Thank you, Mom and Dad, for caring for me. Thank you, Mom and Dad, for feeding me so well. This is the way to get started. Recognize that your tire is low. Don't let it go flat. Pump it up. Pump up.

**Speaker D:** Your mind. Is that also how you change your attitude, right?

**Speaker A:** Like, that's how you change, because you're not a victim of your mom and dad, you're the benefit of their generosity. So does anybody else have any final words? Alex, how you— go ahead, David.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I just want to say thank you, uh, because I really appreciate this. This— you fully answered my question. I feel like, uh, I, I have a good working understanding of what to do, uh, now when dealing with, uh, different forms of discomfort. And also for Yang, uh, I have Also, difficulties with parents. And here's some wisdom that I would love to pass along to you. When you meet intolerance with more intolerance, all you get is more intolerance. Okay, the reason why you don't like your parents is because they were intolerant, period. And if they had been tolerant, we wouldn't have an issue.

**Speaker A:** But we do have an issue because.

**Speaker B:** They are intolerant, and that's the issue. And when you meet them with your intolerant attitude of, this is wrong and I don't like it— attraction and aversion, but super aversion— then you just created more intolerance. You created a fight. And I'm sure you experienced that quite.

**Speaker A:** Frequently.

**Speaker B:** So We cannot continue and meet intolerance with more intolerance, because all we get— it's like fighting fire with fire, just more fire, gasoline, boom, it doesn't work. Okay, so that's, that's what I would suggest. It's helped a lot for me, and it requires a change in right attitude.

**Speaker A:** Have you ever heard of the phrase, when an immovable object is being attacked by an irresistible force, what happens? A collision, a rochon, a lot of damage. So, if you meet an irresistible object, a force like Mom and Dad, they're going to get their way, And if you stand in their way, you're going to get run over. Better to stand out of their way. Get out of the road. That's the diversion. Don't resist them. Enjoy their caring for you. Alex, you know exactly how to apply today's talk. Maybe too late, but never mind. Never mind, start again. Exactly.

**Speaker C:** Over.

**Speaker A:** And over. Okay, does anybody have any last remarks?

**Speaker C:** Good.

### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points and teachings:

### **Core Question:** What skills should we cultivate to skillfully handle discomfort?

**Speaker A (Dhammarato)** answers by framing discomfort as **Dukkha** (dissatisfaction) and outlines a practical path based on the Buddha's teachings.

### **Main Teachings:**

1.  **Shift from "Pain" to "Sensation":** The first skill is to reframe "pain" (which implies aversion) as neutral "sensations" or **messages**. Bodily sensations are communication; ignoring them (e.g., sitting through meditation pain) can cause harm. The goal is to **pay attention** and respond wisely.

2.  **The Foundation: Satipatthana (Four Foundations of Mindfulness):** The primary skill is mindfulness (*sati*), meaning to **remember to pay attention** to:
    *   **The Body:** Sensations (tightness, heat, pressure) as messages.
    *   **Mind States (Attitudes):** e.g., a "victim" mentality vs. a "winner" mentality.
    *   **Thoughts:** Unwholesome vs. wholesome.
    *   **Feelings:** The tone of liking, disliking, or neutrality.
    You cannot change what you do not see. Seeing clearly creates the opportunity for change.

3.  **The Framework: The Four Noble Truths & The Eightfold Path:**
    *   **First Noble Truth:** Recognize discomfort/Dukkha clearly without denial.
    *   **Second Noble Truth:** Understand that we **create our own Dukkha** through our reactions of liking, disliking, and delusion. We are not victims of external circumstances.
    *   **Third Noble Truth:** There is a way out. We **can change** our experience.
    *   **The Path:** Use the tools of the Eightfold Path (especially Right View, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness) to make these changes.

4.  **The Central Attitudinal Shift: Take Responsibility.**
    The talk identifies three layers of doubt that block us:
    1.  **"Who will save me?"** → Shift from a **victim attitude** to "**It's up to me.**"
    2.  **"Am I good enough?"** → Develop the confidence that you **can** develop the skill.
    3.  **"Do I have the right tools?"** → The tools are the Buddha's teachings (Four Noble Truths, Eightfold Path, Ānāpānasati).

5.  **Practical Application & Examples:**
    *   **Bodily Discomfort (Dhammarato's leg):** See swelling/heat as a message to elevate the leg, not as "pain" to be endured. Respond to the message to relax the body.
    *   **Meditation Posture:** If there's pain, adjust, stand, or walk. The goal is **relaxation and comfort**, not endurance for its own sake.
    *   **Mental/Emotional Discomfort (Yen's parents):** See feelings of fear or aversion as messages. Instead of suppressing them or blaming parents, **change your attitude**. Practice gratitude, look for the good, be agreeable. This is **wise diversion** (actively changing your focus) versus **unwise avoidance** (denial and suppression).
    *   **In the Hospital:** Choose thoughts like "I'll handle this," "Everything is okay," and "I can relax here." This transforms a stressful situation into a retreat.

### **Key Metaphors:**
*   **The Flat Tire:** Life problems are like a tire losing pressure. A mindful person (sensitive driver) notices early and pumps it up (makes a skillful change). An unmindful person ignores it, ruins the tire (neurosis), and may even drive on the rim (severe mental distress).
*   **Fighting Fire with Fire:** Meeting intolerance (e.g., from parents) with your own intolerance only creates more conflict. The skillful response is to change your own attitude and reaction.

### **Conclusion:**
The ultimate skill is **the choice to be happy** regardless of circumstances. Discomfort is an opportunity to practice. By paying attention to sensations, taking full responsibility for our reactions, using the tools of the Dhamma to change our attitudes and thoughts, we can "pump up our mind" and find ease. The talk ends with the core refrain: **You are not a victim. Your happiness is your choice.**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this Dharma talk, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate his teachings on handling discomfort, mindfulness, and the Four Noble Truths. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors**
1. **Sensation vs. Pain**  
   - **Metaphor**: Sensations are **messages** from the body or mind, while "pain" is our judgment of disliking those sensations.  
   - **Purpose**: To shift the listener’s relationship with discomfort—from avoidance to mindful investigation.

2. **The Flat Tire**  
   - **Metaphor**: Our mental/emotional state is like a **tire with low pressure**.  
     - A sensitive driver (mindful person) notices and pumps it up early.  
     - Ignoring it leads to a flat tire (neurosis), then driving on the rim (severe mental distress).  
   - **Purpose**: To emphasize the importance of paying attention to early signs of distress and addressing them skillfully.

3. **Acquired Taste**  
   - **Metaphor**: Children’s aversion to bitter foods (like broccoli) is an innate protective mechanism. Over time, we "kill off nerves" through repeated exposure, leading to "acquired taste."  
   - **Purpose**: To illustrate how we often override the body’s natural warning systems, leading to harm or desensitization.

4. **Mosquito Bite**  
   - **Metaphor**: Killing a mosquito while it’s biting you leaves its proboscis and bacteria under your skin, causing more irritation. Better to gently blow it away.  
   - **Purpose**: To teach non-reactive, wise response to irritants rather than impulsive aversion.

5. **Barometric Pressure and the Aching Knee**  
   - **Metaphor**: Uncle Pete knows it will rain because his knee hurts—a sign of sensitivity to atmospheric changes.  
   - **Purpose**: To highlight how the body gives us valuable information if we pay attention.

6. **Diversion vs. Avoidance**  
   - **Metaphor**: Diversion is like skillfully moving out of the way of a truck; avoidance is denying the truck exists and getting hit.  
   - **Purpose**: To distinguish between skillful redirection of attention and unskillful suppression/denial.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1. **Meditators Harming Themselves**  
   - **Story**: Bhante Palo and Bhante Vimalaramsi ignored body pain during meditation, leading to permanent injury (e.g., unable to sit on the floor, needing a chair).  
   - **Purpose**: Warns against the misguided "no pain, no gain" approach to meditation.

2. **Dhammarato’s Hospital Experience**  
   - **Story**: His 9-day hospitalization for a severely swollen foot. Instead of resisting, he treated it as a retreat—relaxing, accepting, and observing sensations without adding "poor me" narratives.  
   - **Purpose**: Demonstrates applying Dharma in extreme discomfort—changing attitude from victimhood to "I can handle this."

3. **The 2004 Tsunami**  
   - **Story**: Tourists on the beach ignored receding water (a natural warning), while elephants sensed vibrations and fled to higher ground.  
   - **Purpose**: Illustrates how ignorance/disregard of signals leads to disaster; mindfulness saves.

4. **Programming Error**  
   - **Story**: Forgetting semicolons in PHP code leads to errors—it’s not the compiler’s fault, but the programmer’s responsibility to notice and fix it.  
   - **Purpose**: Parallels taking responsibility for one’s mental states rather than blaming external factors.

5. **Parent-Child Conflict**  
   - **Story**: A student’s intense sensitivity toward parents. Dhammarato advises reframing: see parental yelling as caring, not attack, and respond with gratitude.  
   - **Purpose**: Teaches how to transform relational conflict by shifting attitude and perception.

### **Recurring Themes in Metaphors/Stories**
- **Messages vs. Problems**: Discomfort is a messenger, not an enemy.  
- **Skillful Response**: Pay attention, adjust, and relax—don’t suppress or endure blindly.  
- **Attitude Shift**: From victim ("poor me") to empowered ("I can handle this").  
- **Natural Wisdom**: The body/mind already knows what it needs; we just need to listen.  
- **Dukkha as Feedback**: Suffering is information to guide change, not a flaw to be eliminated.

These metaphors and stories make the teachings on **Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing), the Four Noble Truths, and the Eightfold Path** relatable and practical, emphasizing **mindful awareness, personal responsibility, and wise adaptation**.
