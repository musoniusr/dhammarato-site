### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Sit over here a little bit, keep the sun out. So, Aaron, welcome. I'm glad to have seen you last Saturday, and we just got started talking about criticism, and that I would go so far as to to say, but the Buddha was really, really big on this issue of Buddhism and how to stop it. And in fact, the word in the Pali is Silabhata Paramasa. Sila there is like the rules, and what we do is we attach to these rules, and for some children following the rules keeps them alive. And so, yeah, we really do have to follow the rules. Now, the point is, is that it's not the rules that are on the signs or on the post or actually in the books. It's the rules that we carry around in our head. And so we wind up being very critical of ourselves. Critical of the environment, critical of everything. And that this gets started somewhere around the age of 3 or 4, gets really heavy-duty by the age of 6 when we start school, because then we're no longer mommy's tender infant. We're either mommy's little helper, or we're the little bastard who doesn't cooperate. 'Go do your homework, learn your ABCs. I don't care whether you're enjoying your life anymore or not, you got to learn to read. Pick up your toys, pick up your room, do what you're told to do.' And so we all get into that style, we all get into that mentality. But there is something really, really important to that, and that is that it was new It was newly added to the child when the child was first born. We were completely dependent, a complete victim to our environment, but we survived because we were nurtured and cared for by mommy. Didn't even know what a tit was until it was plopped in our face. So all of these instincts catch in. And so, in the beginning, the mother and the child bond together. There's actually chemicals that they know about. And the example would be that all of the nurses on the maternity ward, they all live and die for being in the room at the time, not of the birth, but of the meeting of the child, after the baby is first newly born. Somebody will go clean it up, and somebody else will clean up Mom, wheel her to her bedroom, and then the baby comes in with a big celebration. All that bonding happens. I am the mommy, and this is my job to take care of, and I love it. Okay, so that's the bonding. The nurturing starts then. Unfortunately, we get used to it And then it stops. And we all, for the rest of our lives, pine for that being nurtured and taken care of, and everything we do is okay. By the time we're 4 or 6, we're not nurtured anymore. We're told what to do.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And that the dumb animal The dumb.

**Speaker B:** Animal that gets told what to do.

**Speaker A:** Precisely right. We all become dumb animals that do what we're told to do. But the worst part about that is, is that the dumb animal not only does not have a choice about doing what he's told to do, he also does not have a choice about how to feel, how to do it. That if he were given a project in a nurturing way, then he might want to do the project. Then he can enjoy his work. He's not taught that way. He's taught to do it no matter what. "You sit down and you do that homework right now. You concentrate on it. No more dilly-dallying around. No more playing." I mean, we've all heard that kind of thing. It's a double whammy to lose the nurturing and get piled on with the criticism. So we begin to have those habits of criticizing, criticizing, criticizing ourselves, criticize others, get criticized by everyone, and that we don't have any more bonding. Okay, so this is the state of being that we wind up growing up into, and no one really ever comes out of that victimhood, the twin victimhood. One, not being able to take care of ourselves and have to be nurtured. And then the second, um, is the criticism, being told what to do and never wind up enjoying it. So these two things we carry into adulthood. And it's the teaching of the Buddha, is how we can drop that stuff, simply by catching the fact that we are criticizing ourselves, criticizing others, and start nurturing ourselves and nurturing others. That's the whole secret to the teaching of the Buddha right there. That's the whole show. Then in fact, there's a sutta where the Buddha talks about— Ananda comes up after having been with Sariputta and says that friendship is half the Dhamma, and the Buddha corrects him and says, "No, friendship is not half the Dhamma, it's the whole Dhamma, that's all there is." But it's a twin kind of complex, that's why it looks like half, because normally we think of the word friendship as being friendly with other people. But the big deal is to become friends with ourselves, start nurturing ourselves, and stop the criticism. Now, the time when we're most likely to criticize ourselves is when we catch ourselves doing something that we don't want to do. So Goenka has a very favorite phrase that he uses, or he used, and is recorded and repeated often, and that little phrase is, "When the mind wanders away from the breath, never mind, start again." And the reason for that is that the students, when they catch their mind wandering away from the breath, they don't never mind, start again, they beat the tar out of themselves. "Oh, you're supposed to be meditating now, this is hard." "Maybe this is not a good place to go, maybe this is not my day, maybe the teacher is no good, maybe this is a bad method, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe," but I am hard on myself rather than being nurturing and gentle on myself. "Oh, the mind wandered away, never mind, let's just go back and start again." That would be then the correct practice, but very few people start practicing correctly because they go according to their habits of being critical. And so, we have to actually practice then, being friends with ourselves, warts and all. That's a saying that's really interesting, because many people are introduced to Buddhism through things called precepts. Thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not kill. I mean, it sounds in the minds of most people very Christian-like with the Ten Commandments. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Very critical kinds of things. But really, in the actual teachings of the Buddha, it is from the perspective of once the mind is clean and bright and pure and we don't want anything. And we're friendly with ourselves and others, then we're very unlikely to hurt them, very unlikely to steal from them, we're very unlikely to lie, cheat, steal, any of that kind of stuff. But we're very likely to behave that way because of the critical nature and the capitalism which is a kind of— actually capitalism is very much a dog-eat-dog world. You can see that we got into that kind of mentality actually quite instinctively. The instinct, first off, the most important instinct is the self-preservation instinct, and that's where fear comes up. And most of the time we're dealing with other people as if we were afraid of them. That's why we've got to compete with them. If we weren't afraid of them, we wouldn't bother to compete. I've already won. Don't bother to compete. So, like in any sport, let us say chess, a national or world grand champion, when he plays a game of chess with a child or a student. It doesn't matter, because he could win that game easily. What matters is that now you're being a mentor and a coach, and you want to let the child win sometimes, so that the child can get the feeling of winning, and then get interested in life, chess. I've actually done that many times by teaching my daughter checkers. I was too good at checkers, and because of that, I would give her moves back. I would show her, oh, if you move there, I'm going to take 3 pieces. You got to watch what you're doing on the board and that kind of thing. So we don't— if we do train our students that way, then they will learn. But if they— we don't— if the child is not enjoying what he's doing, he's going to quit, he's not going to be very good at it. And then we have to really push him to get him to do it. An example of that would be a young child who's taking piano lessons. If the child actually enjoys it, if he can learn one or two songs and get interested in playing the piano— that's why it was so popular, chopsticks, because it's really easy to learn to play— and if a kid can learn to play chopsticks, he'll like it so much he might want to start actually doing the work of learning scales and chord fingering and that kind of stuff, right? But if the kid takes a year or two of piano lessons and doesn't like it, then it's a drudgery, and his mother will probably stop paying because she sees that the kid's not getting anything out of it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I have experience with, uh, with a child in that way.

**Speaker A:** So, if we can then begin a practice of changing the structure or turning the tables on that kind of education that we've all received, that's what the practice of Anapanasati is all about. That basically the teachings of the Buddha are very, very simple. He says it this way, he says that, "I only teach one thing, both formerly and now I teach only one thing, and that is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha." And that even though the Westerners have gotten Dukkha and just made it a great big huge thing they call suffering, most of our Dukkha is not actually suffering, it's just dissatisfaction. That we put up with a whole lot of stuff that's not really up to our scratch. So we criticize it, but we put up with it anyway. Okay, and the teachings of the Buddha is saying, no, we don't put up with our dissatisfactions. Catch them, turn them around. Turn that stuff around, uh, by, by recognizing Recognizing that when the mind wanders away from the breath, that's the time to congratulate yourself for seeing that the mind has wandered away from.

**Speaker B:** The breath.

**Speaker A:** For the blessing ourselves because it did.

**Speaker B:** And could I ask a question about that? So the dissatisfaction, is it purely dissatisfaction in our attitude, or would you also consider, you know, like the standards that we expect of the world, if we're dissatisfied with them, is that also the dissatisfaction?

**Speaker A:** Any kind of dissatisfaction is dissatisfaction.

**Speaker B:** Because ultimately it's our mind that's in that state, right?

**Speaker A:** Right, ultimately the mind is in a state state of dissatisfaction, no matter what was the source of the dissatisfaction. That in fact, the Buddha strongly recommends that we begin our practice in seclusion, that we get away from the world and all of our dissatisfactions out there, and so we sit quietly, close the eyes, and start just monitoring what's going on inside the mind and inside the body. Start looking at what's going on. And there we find that the root of the dissatisfaction is almost always inside, that we're dissatisfied with ourselves. Not friends, we're not nurturing. And so when students recognize that their mind has wandered away, instead of nurturing themselves, they complain, they criticize. And we're very critical of ourselves. Why are we that way? We were taught that from childhood. We were criticized, criticized by our parents. So we learned how to criticize ourselves by listening to our parents criticize us.

**Speaker B:** It's especially dissatisfying when you have contradictory competing rules, right? You can be dissatisfied with both sides of it.

**Speaker A:** Right, is that there's often so many rules that they are contradictory.

**Speaker B:** Like, be friendly but don't talk about yourself, or, you know, different things that.

**Speaker A:** Could complete— those are a lot of the social conventions. But another thing that we can see that's actually quite common is that you get good advice, and that good advice— there's good advice everywhere. The problem is, is that we don't remember to take the good advice when we need to take that advice. The most. Okay, like look both ways before you cross the street, right? And yet the kid's playing ball and he's now in the heat of the game and he's not going to look twice. He's just going to run out in the road to catch that ball. Okay, so, um, the other side of it though is that when we do get good advice, we often turn that into a rule.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so we make new rules with the good advice that we've had, rather than learning when and where to apply that good advice. And if we don't remember to take the good advice, then we don't take the good advice, or in that moment, if we don't remember that advice, then we're unlikely to behave in that direction. So the practice really is in a way twofold. That is, number one is you start practicing with the concept of moving the critical thinking and start into the nurturing thinking while at the same time time. Let's not make that a rule. Let's not make that good advice into a rule, because when you're not nurturing yourself, when you're critical, then you'll be critical of that too, right? And so, um, in the Pali texts, this issue of critical versus nurturing, I take those two words out of Eric Berne's Transactional Analysis, which we'll talk about a bit. But in the teachings of the Buddha, there's a wide variety of language that's used for that. One of them is that the critical mind is an obstructed mind, that the mind is obstructed or it is hindered. These are the hindrances, or this is this criticism. That we get restless, we get worried, get agitated, we want things, etc., like that. And so we're in a way critical because we don't have what we want. And so another language that's used is wholesome and unwholesome thoughts. But wholesome and unwholesome is used quite a lot. The Pali word, by the way, is kusala and akusala. And the word kusala actually comes from a very, very heavy grass, like lemongrass, long blades, very thick, serrated also. And in the time of the Buddha, they would take this kusala grass grass and dry it under a heavy weight like a log or a brick or something, and then it was suitable to be used as a knife. You could cut cloth, you could cut bread, you could cut all kinds of things with this. It's a very easy, cheap knife, and you don't have any grasp on iron around. The grass itself would be cuttable. Okay, and so when we say Hosho, That means that we can see into it, we can cut through it, we can diagnose it. Okay, you've heard diagnostics or diagnosing. Okay, what does that mean? The diag is the cutting, so right, know it, right, right, sure, right. You take it apart, you, uh, isolate the damage, etc., like that. So this is what we mean by shala. Versus ekusala, which means just leaving those unwholesome things unwholesome without diagnosing them. But let us say using discernment. Okay, another way that we talk about it is in the sense of the nurturing is to gladden the mind to brighten the mind, make the mind bright and shining. Okay, so we've got obstructions, we've got hindrances, we've got wholesome versus unwholesome, and we've got brightening the mind. These are the words that are used in the literature, but I'm also adding the words nurturing and critical. Okay, now the interesting thing about the nurturing part that most people think is, is that, oh, I can be nurturing to myself once I pass the critical test. I've got to get up to scratch first. I've got to meet my standards, and then I can get my nurturing. That my love for myself is conditional. Okay, and what we're actually teaching teaching here, and this is such an important thing, is to start taking yourself unconditionally loving, unconditionally being friends with ourselves. Even when we catch ourselves screwing up, we don't criticize that, we nurture it in the sense of, "Wow, I'm glad that I caught myself screwing up there. I can see it.".

**Speaker B:** And then make that more salient than the screw-up. Exactly, right.

**Speaker A:** Catching the screw-up is more valuable or wholesome than just screwing up and hating that you screwed up. In fact, if we don't like the screw-up, we'll try to hide it. We'll hide it from ourselves in the state of denial, and we'll hide it from others in the state of lying.

**Speaker B:** Or try to blame somebody else for why we screwed up, right?

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker B:** It wasn't me.

**Speaker A:** Instead of accepting that we screw up naturally, that every toddler who's learning to walk is going to fall down a whole bunch of times. If they were critical, and every— I mean, if you were critical of the child, 18 months old, just beginning to stand up And as soon as he falls down the first time without even getting one step going, and we spank the child because he can't walk yet, that child may never learn to walk. Okay, the same thing true with piano, that if the child is enjoying the mistakes that he's making and he's still getting through the piece, then he's enjoying it. But if the teacher stops him and spanks his fingers with a ruler because he missed a note, Now he's not enjoying it. Okay, and so here we are as an adult banging our own fingers with rulers because that's what happened to us as a child.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and we're not seeing the next thing that's happening while we're criticizing ourselves.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. So, all right, so this is the actual, um, aspect. So let's get into it from that quality of Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Because most in the West, because they're already in that critical mind state, they think that they have to look at the Dukkha, see the Dukkha, inspect the Dukkha, cut the Dukkha open and see how bad the Dukkha is, and see that this Dukkha is related to that Dukkha, and that Dukkha is going down the Dukkha rabbit hole, and down at the bottom of it is fear, disgust, despair, anguish, and a strong desire to get out of it. Well, you already had the strong desire to get out of it before you ever started practicing in the first place, so there's no reason for us to use our practice to take ourselves into some dark night of the soul or whatever they want to call it. Okay, then in fact, the right way to practice is to come out of the criticism and congratulate ourselves immediately. Which actually means then we go from Dukkha immediately, avoid it, and come into the state of the Third Noble Truth, of being free from the Dukkha, which is actually the Pali word for that is Sukkha. Sukkha and Dukkha are opposites. And so if we can practice getting the mind into a state of Sukkha, then that's the practice, that's the whole thing. And one of the important qualities that we have to understand is that the Dukkha is not given to us, it's not a tsunami that God Almighty makes, or thunder and lightning, or any of the things that the bully does, right? It's not the source of Dukkha. The source of Dukkha is that we don't like the bully. We don't like it, we want him to do something else, we want him to go pester some other kid or anything like that, but it's the fact that we don't like it. That's the dissatisfaction right there. The dissatisfaction comes from my feelings. And so there's a lot of teaching about feelings because the mind is the forerunner, and the way that we're thinking is going to affect our feelings. And vice versa, in the sense that in many, many sports and other things, if you can get your opponent angry, then you can defeat him. Because when they're angry, that means that the whole body fills with the blood and they're not thinking much anymore. In fact, in the 1972 World Chess Championship, Bobby Fischer won over Boris Spassky. They don't have much of this in the literature, but in some of the books about it, they will point out that Bobby Fischer did any and everything he could to irritate Boris Spassky. One of the techniques that he uses— there's a rule that if you touch a piece in chess when it's your turn, you've got to move that piece. Well, Bobby Fischer would take his hand and hover over a piece but not actually touch it, okay, and just let it be there. And he was looking all over the board about to touch that piece, and then he would pick up and move another piece over here. Well, here Boris Spassky is all going in his mind about what am I going to do when he moves that piece over there, and then he moves this one. Another one that he would do is when it was Boris Spassky's turn, he would stand up, walk around, and look over Spassky's So there you are having chess with this guy's face right there. And he would also be late and other things like that and just completely get his opponent befuddled. You see that in court, you see that in debates. In fact, there's a thing called ad hominem attacks. You're not supposed to attack the personality of your opponent because that will throw him off.

**Speaker B:** Right, trigger him maybe.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Okay, so this is part of the proof then that we can't think straight when we're feeling bad. So in order to think straight, we've got to get out of our anger, our frustrations, and all of that. And so this is actually a great big part of the practice, is to understand that all of this dissatisfaction that we have in our lives We create it, we manufacture it. How do we do that? Because we're in the habit of doing it. We were taught how to do that as children, and we continue with those habits our whole lives. And so some of those habits gets really deeply ingrained, and see those things and make a change to it. That's stuff open.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And can you talk about the other way around where the feelings, we sort of, the feelings trigger thoughts in that sort of the opposite way?

**Speaker A:** Fine. You can think about the human being as a complex machine and possibly just As an example, we'll use an alarm clock, a desktop clock, the old style that had gears and wheels and springs and all of that kind of stuff in it. And our job actually is to dismantle the clock and clean it out, take all the dust and the dirt from the cogs and oil the bearings, the jewel bearings, etc., like that. And put it back together again so that it functions correctly. Because when the clock has gotten dirty, it doesn't work very well. Extra frictions and things like this, balance wheel gets out of balance and all of that kind of stuff. So in that regard, with that example, we're going to actually examine the body as a unit. We're going to examine the feelings as a unit, and we're going to examine the mind as a unit, and then we're going to watch how these things fit together so we can put it all together again and recognize that the feelings affect the body, the feelings affect the mind, the body affects the feelings, the feelings affect the mind, the body affects the mind, and they're all three running and circling around one another, and we do that ignorantly. We're not aware of what's going on, not paying attention. And so this whole quality then is—.

**Speaker B:** And that— so we're not seeing the cause and effect in that dynamic, right?

**Speaker A:** So, uh, a really easy example then of seeing is, is that When the body is sick, when the body is sick, we feel bad, and because we feel bad, the mind is low. And so, a sick body, but if we're wise, if we're wise to that, if we can see it, then we can change our language about it: "Oh, the body's sick, but it'll be okay. I'll get out of this. Let me lay here and enjoy." that I've got no place to go and nothing to do. I can keep my mind clean even though the body is sick. It's okay that the body is sick. We'll use that as a training tool. And in fact, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa says is that when we're sick, that's an excellent opportunity to practice. That's a really good time to practice if we're already skilled in practicing. If we're not schooled in practicing, then we can't practice when we're sick. We actually have to— it's almost like going to a gym. That the new kid that goes to the gym does not go to the very, very heavy weights to start. He starts with little weights, starts with 1 or 2 kilogram dumbbells, and you do the reps over and over and over and over and over and over again. That repetitive quality of building the muscles is actually a major part of the practice, is that we have to repeat this over and over again, because we our whole lives have been talking ourselves into feeling bad. Now it's time to repeat over and over again to talk ourselves into feeling good. So we've got a lot of old history, we've got a lot of old dirt. And so polishing and polishing and polishing and polishing will eventually remove all of the old dirt.

**Speaker B:** And the sort of talking ourselves into feeling good, um, is it sort of irregardless of the conditions that we're in?

**Speaker A:** Well, let us say, um, that that's not generally the case. Generally, the case is, is that when we have no skills, we can't handle anything very well. Can't even handle getting insulted, right? But as the skill level grows, we begin to handle things that we're used to not being able to handle. But there's still a whole lot of stuff we can't handle yet. And so, uh, in a way, the training means is that we can't just sit there with, uh, sitting in private doing 1 kilogram dumbbell. We have to actually go to the bigger stuff and progress through it.

**Speaker B:** So that— and but we also can't just jump to the big stuff, right?

**Speaker A:** Right. Uh, so we practice in seclusion first to be able to at least get the mind cleaned out when it's got no heavy-duty work to do. There's nothing to lift. All we have to do is just get the mind into a good state. And then we can learn to do that even when the cell phone breaks, or even when the postman comes. Right, that's the whole idea, is that we kind of build up to it and we begin to— but we don't have a whole lot of control about what thing's going to happen. Anything can happen at any time, and some of it we're going to be able to handle, and some of it we're not. Yeah, but as time goes on and we begin to handle some of the intermediate stuff, now we're ready to handle the really heavy-duty stuff.

**Speaker B:** And by handle, you mean stay satisfied?

**Speaker A:** Stay satisfied even when you're at, let us say, the one standing that doesn't have a gun in the firing squad. Because in fact, we're all going to die. Everybody's going to die. You can count on it. You're going to die. You're going to get sick, get old, and die. The Buddha is really big on illness, sickness, old age, and death, because it happens to everybody if we're lucky. If we're not lucky, we die young. But if we're lucky, we're going to get old. And every old person gets sick. And so when we're young, if we can handle being sick, then when we're getting older, we can handle being sick. And in fact, that's why we want, as Bhikkhu Buddhadasa says, use sickness as an object of meditation. And it's a really excellent time to practice, because there's going to be some day that you're going to get so sick, it's going to kill you. How can you handle that if you can't handle the stubbed toe? Okay, so this is actually a training for the really, really big stuff, but we do it a little bit at a time. Um, and if we've got nobles around us, they'll set us up in positions to grow. Put us under pressure, not enough pressure that we go into Dukkha, but just enough pressure so that we can get over it and learn something, get that heavier training. It's like when our coach brings over a 10-kilogram dumbbell and says, "Here, do this one." And then we recognize, "Oh, I can do that." I am ready for it. Okay, so this is one of the reasons for being around other nobles, is because they can guide us and help us as we're progressing. They don't have the same confirmation biases that we have. This is also one of the real good reasons why the teaching of the Dharma is best done on a one-on-one instruction But look at all the stuff that really is done one-on-one. I mean, if a kid really wants to learn Anagami, it's better for him to be there with the book and the teacher rather than sitting in the back of the class being disturbed by half the other kids that are not interested.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so a great big meditation class is not the best place to learn. Because the students, for one thing, they don't get a chance to ask the questions like you do in your own Skype chats. And so the Dhamma is actually best learned from a teacher who knows what he's talking about so he can guide the student easily. The problem is, is that a book, you can't get Dhamma out of a book because you get to page 96 and the book doesn't say that, hey man, you're on the wrong page here, go back to page 6. That's what you need to do right now, right?

**Speaker B:** You shouldn't be here, right?

**Speaker A:** Right. You're trying to pick up a dumbbell too big, and you're going to get frustrated and angry and upset and uptight because you can't do something that you knew you couldn't do before you tried it. Um, so Moving in this direction, there is actually a method to practice. That method is actually called the Eightfold Noble Path, but guess what? The word path is a bad translation. We immediately think that it's a journey or a destination, a footpath, a horse path, a trail, a highway, something like that. In fact, it's not a path at all that way. Uh, in fact, the word way is better because we also use the word way for like a parkway or a highway, but it's also a method. This is the way to do it. Okay, so that's actually the, uh, the Eightfold Noble Way would be a better word, but Eightfold Noble Method actually nails it. This is something that you're doing right here, right now. It's not something that you've got to go someplace to do. Okay, so I use the analogy of a door. The door is right here in front of you, and all you need is the key to the door. You put it in, you turn the latch, you push the door open. The pushing of the door open is the right effort. The key to it is to remember to look at what's going on, or remember to turn the crank, turn that knob, okay, to change it a little bit. And then we take the effort to push that thing right open. These are actual items on the Eightfold Noble Path: Right View, Right Effort, Right Sati. Now the word view is misunderstood in the sense that we use the word view for viewpoints, worldviews, ways of looking at things. And this is true for wrong view and ordinary right view. But this practicing kind of noble right view is not a noun, it's a verb. It's right noble viewing, looking, inspecting right here, right right now. Okay, so it's not— it's not a conclusion or a criticism or a concept. It's an investigation.

**Speaker B:** It's remembering to be viewing, to do that cutting.

**Speaker A:** Remember to do that diagnosing, to cut that thing open, to see what's in there. Okay. And that once we do, once we make that diagnosis and we cut that thing in there, we can see that this is a nut to crack, or this is hard, or this is an unwholesome thought. And so now we take the right effort to change it from an unwholesome thought of "this is hard, this is a nut, this is difficult," into "Oh, I've got this, I can handle this, I can do this." Everything is going in that kind of direction. There's actually— it's— there is a kind of universal law like gravity. And that is, is that what we— the mind— the Buddha talks about it like this. The mind is the forerunner. The mind is the forerunner. Wherever the mind goes, reality will follow. An example of that is someone who is afraid of dogs. Will be the one that the dogs are barking at, because they can sense that fear. So, if we are creating mental thoughts like, "Oh, this is hard, this is difficult, I'll try," then we've already got in the mind failure. But if we bring into the mind the mental processing of success. I could do this. This is possible. Then we could bring it about in naturality. This is part of the gladdening the mind, from no, I can't, or oh, me, into hey, I can do this.

**Speaker B:** And then when we fail, naturally we don't trip over our failure as well, right?

**Speaker A:** When we become a success deep inside, then whatever we do that we used to call failures, we don't call that failures anymore. We call it an opportunity for growth. That our failures were failures because we call them failures, and so we call ourselves a failure. And we have to change that attitude. We have to change that, that in fact we practice these three things of waking up to remember, be here now, to look at what the mind is doing, Number 2: First Sati, then Ditti, and then Viriya, to take the effort that it takes to make a change. Now, right effort has a quality to it that's quite interesting, and that is that people practice way too much effort, put too much effort in everything. In fact, when the child is doing his homework and Mama is watching him, he puts even more effort than it takes to actually do the arithmetic. He has to struggle with it, writ his brow, dull the pencil, break the pencil point, you know, all that kind of stuff happens because we're working too hard. And then there is also the not working hard enough, and that's also done in meditation quite a lot. So students will have to start because of their nature either not work hard enough or too hard, to where right noble effort is just the least amount of work necessary to actually get the job done. Okay, so the analogy that I use there is imagine that you're standing in the road and you look over to the right and you see that there's a great big lorry, a great big truck, a semi bearing down on you at 50 meters at high speed. If we don't have enough effort, then we just let that truck run right over us. That's the Vajrayana method, and they call that choiceless awareness. And then there is the Mahayana method of the noting, and that is more like Popeye the Sailor Man, who stands there after he's taken his spinach, holds his great big puts his fist out and gets run over by that truck. But one's right noble effort is to see the truck coming and just get out of the way, step aside.

**Speaker B:** Be.

**Speaker A:** About of the road. This is the way that we begin to understand that, oh, I can just get out of my own way. I don't have to run over myself. Okay, so this is one's right effort, is just the right amount of effort that it takes to throw that unwholesome thought out of the mind, put a wholesome thought into the mind. And when we have a wholesome thought, that generally thought about what's happening right now, or an unwholesome thought is generally about fussing about what happened in the past, or trying to figure out how to handle the future. In fact, past and the future are very dangerous places. All kinds of bad happens in the past to us already, and boy, can we plan all kinds of bad things to happen. Like this very minute, we're safe.

**Speaker B:** And if we try to plan good things, there's all kinds of doubts about whether we're able to do that.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. But right here, right now, we're actually safe. And so we actually pay attention to the fact that there are no alligators, there's no frogs, there's no barking dogs, there's no militia, there is no SWAT team, there is no boogeyman, there's no bear in the closet. All of these childhood things we don't have to deal with anymore. They're not there. We can feel safe and secure.

**Speaker B:** Sorry about the beeping.

**Speaker A:** So this would be then wholesome language that we could use, is to say, there's no reason to be afraid right now. I could just sit here and just relax, just relax. I don't have to have this mental concept about some train or some truck barreling down on us. If we could just let that go, know it well, and let it pass by. Just throw it out, let it go, and we come back to the security and the safety of this present moment. Also in the practice, we want to practice with the body to make the body feel— if the body is uptight, tense, in pain, then the mind is going to be uptight, in pain, and so we need to get the body situated in a natural place. You probably already know enough about Buddhism in the West to know about retreats, and those retreats are actually way over the heads of most of the students, and they wind up with a lot of body pain because they're not used to sitting on the floor. And I wouldn't recommend sitting on the floor, but Asians do that because in the tropics we don't need furniture. Furniture is cold weather, and by the culture. And so whatever posture that you're in, whether you're sitting on a chair or on the floor, the important thing is to get the body comfortable, which means we actually have to pay attention to the body. Taking long deep breaths will help relax the body. The mind will be breathing, we relax the body, we experience the body, and by experiencing and finding out where the tensions are, we relax the body. This is the part of Anapanasati that's concerned with the body. The intention is to get the body relaxed and secure comfort. So we intentionally talk ourselves into that, getting into postures that are comfortable. And then we talk about that. "Ah, the body feels really good right now. Oh, this is a really good breath." And so now our thoughts about what's happening in this present moment. Because all of the trouble is either in the past or off in the future, but right now everything's okay. And so this is the way we begin to practice, and then the mind will wander away, and when we catch it wandering away, "Oh, never mind, never mind, you're a good kid. It's okay, the mind wandered away, just come back and start again." And yet most new students, when the mind mind wanders away, they actually take an opportunity to beat themselves to a frazzle. Not good enough. Oh, this is a monkey mind. Oh, I can't control this. They're controlling the thing all along. They chose to have that thought.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I'm curious about about that if the student is better at the meditation than the rest of the day, let's say, when their mind's being pulled into other tasks?

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, here's kind of an important point. In the West, they have gotten into the habit of those very, very long sittings, like for an hour hour and a half, 2 hours. But it's a much, much better way to practice is several times a day, because then instead of— you can imagine it like that. We have spent years and years and years in hindrance, and then we're taking an hour, and part of that hour is in hindrance, and part of that hour is in correct practice. And then for 23 hours we're all hindrance all the time. The likelihood of the hindrances winning is high, so we have to practice a different way, and that is by practicing on a much more frequent basis. So if we're going to practice an hour, we can take that hour, do a whole lot of things with it. One of the things we can do is say, okay, we're going to practice 3 times a day for 20 minutes. Or we could practice 4 times a day for 15 minutes. We can practice 6 times a day for 10 minutes, or if we're really sharp or really need the meditation, just for 5 minutes, we can practice once an hour.

**Speaker B:** Is there a danger to being really good at the 1 hour and then not doing it?

**Speaker A:** I've never met anybody who is actually very good at the 1 hour. Yeah, because the mind has got an attention span. The mind gets dull. When the mind gets dull, the breathing gets dull. The mind gets dull, or they go into a really dull state. And when they wake out of that, they say, oh, that must have been Jhana. It's just a really dull state. Yeah, dullness is the habit of students who are practicing too long. It's better, in fact, to practice just long enough to get yourself into a pretty, really good state. Wow, I feel so good! And then get up out of meditation and practice whatever you were doing in your life in that really, really good mood. And when the good mood wears out, then let's go back and get ourselves back into a good mood. Okay, this doesn't actually take very long. Possibly 6 times a day for 10 minutes would be a good place to start, knowing that I've got only this 10 minutes and that's enough time to practice, to be— to get the mind into a really good state. I could feel safe, secure, and then satisfied. So this is the way to practice, to break it up into short pieces and start practicing these three things over and over again. To remember, take a deep breath. Remember, quieten the mind. Remember, investigate the mind and to remove the unwholesome thoughts and put wholesome thoughts in. And so we practice uses over and over and over again with thoughts like, I feel safe, I feel, I feel, wow, this is good, I like this breath. Okay, these are all, by the way, nurturing thoughts also.

**Speaker B:** Now, so those are, those are what you would consider wholesome thoughts? Is that the same as gladdening the mind, or are those two different?

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's exactly gladdening the mind. Okay, brightening the mind. There is a subtle kind of difference in there, but the point is that we're also not paying attention to just the objects of the mind or what thoughts we're having, but we also pay attention to the states or the condition that the mind is in. Is the mind dull? Is it sharp? Is it comfortable? Is it exalted? Is it full of joy? Is it a joyful, gladdened mind, a brightened-up mind, or is it a dull mind? And with proper breathing, breathing deeply, we actually start to change the bodily chemistry that helps brighten up the mind. Oh, you've got a visitor.

**Speaker B:** The EMS, I think, go down the street a lot.

**Speaker A:** So, um, this is the way to begin practice. These 3 things out of the Eightfold Noble Path run and circle around one another. Over and over and over again. And as we do that, we begin to build up some confidence. That confidence is a really big thing. That's the important one. Sometimes it's called a vision. An example of that is that of Elon Musk. If you know anything about Elon Musk and Tesla, you know that he's driven. He knows what he wants and he's going to go get it, right? That's the kind of confidence that we want to build up, to build up the 'I can do this.' Wow, I feel so good. Yeah, hey, I feel good because I feel confident and I feel like a winner. This is the Samma Sanghappa.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And when we bring those four things together, that brings the mind into a unified state. That confidence that I can do this is the unification, to where the criticism is a disunification. It is finding faults, it's breaking things apart, it's being unfriendly. But if we start with nurturing and friendly, and then we develop the attitude that I can do this, then that really brings things together.

**Speaker B:** And if we're bringing it together for ourselves, it's hard to not do that for others, right?

**Speaker A:** When you're in a joyful mood, you said you spread that joy to others. It's hard to really cheer somebody up.

**Speaker B:** Until you're cheerful yourself, until you trip again, until you trip again on the competitive aspect, right?

**Speaker A:** Exactly. But when you're already the best guy in the room and you know that you're the very best in the room, then you can— an example of that, let us say that you've got a situation where one guitar player after another gets up on the stage and shows off, okay, for whatever. Maybe it's a competition or a contest or whatever like that. And when you're on stage, you have the confidence that you're already the best one here. Ain't nobody going to do anything, so you could just have a ball playing your instruments. Get your axe just smoking because you love it. But then when you go down and you sit in the audience, then you don't have to compare what you did with the other guys. You can let the other guy smoke and burn and really show off his talent, and you give him a great big hand because you really like the fact that he's good. Yeah, not as good as you are, but he's good. But if we have the idea that, oh, he's better than I am, Oh, poor me, I've got to go practice. Oh, and then we begin to get critical ourselves.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, he might, might beat me if he's better than me.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Okay, so here's the thing, and we can use this kind of as an, um, an equation. You know, the equation, the most, uh, important one would be the equal sign, but we also have greater than and equal and greater than and less than. We have equivalency, there's a lot of different signs that mathematics uses. What we're going to do is stop using those symbols in our mind of less than or greater than. Then when we're good at that, when we stop comparing things and just let them be, the next thing that we do is then we remove the equal sign. Stop comparing altogether, stop having an equation, and instead the new symbol that we want to put in there is the heart symbol. A loves B, rather than A is less than B, or A is greater than B, or A equals B. No, A and B are good friends. That's the mathematics that we're going to be doing. Stop comparing ourselves. Let him be the very best he could be, but he's certainly not as good as me because I'm not comparing anymore. I'm just enjoying what he's doing like I'm enjoying what I'm doing. And how he's the very best there is, and so am I. Very best there is. No No comparison needed.

**Speaker B:** How does that work within yourself if you're comparing?

**Speaker A:** This is all right. No place to go and nothing to do. I've already done the job. The job that needed to be done has been done. Okay, sundown, time for the bell to ring, time for the slave to put down his big sack of cotton and sit down on it. Just take a rest. Just stop working. Stop comparing. Stop striving and just enjoy. What a relief it is that the job is over now. Don't have to work. So what was the job to do? The job was to throw the problems away rather than solving them. We think that the problem needs to be solved and then the work has been done. No, the real work to do is to have no problems. And when we have no problems, the work is done. So get into the state of having no problems. Right now there's no problem. Right now there's no place to go and nothing to do and everything is just hunky-dory. So that's the way that we practice. We practice getting the mind into a really good state, and just like I've been talking here, you can talk yourself into getting into a pretty good state in only 10 minutes. After you do that, you're ready to go do anything happily. So that's the way that we practice, and we do it several times a day. Doing these 4 things: to remember to look, make a change; remember to look and make a change; to remember to look, to make a change and then congratulate ourselves for it. Yeah, we can do this! Now we've got to remember to take a look, make a change, and pat ourselves on the back, congratulate ourselves. And with that, that becomes— by practicing that over and over, the mind becomes unified around this. The Pali word is shraddha. Shraddha means confidence. It's translated as faith, but it's not faith because this is evidence-based. We've got solid evidence that I feel good. So this is how we practice, and we can do that in seclusion, get ourselves in a really good state, and then we can go off and do whatever we.

**Speaker B:** Will. And then when we— the more we're in that state, the more we can be confident that we can do it.

**Speaker A:** That we can do the job, rather than doing it because we were told to do it and not enjoy it. Now we can actually enjoy it because we got the mind in a state of joy, state of can-do, a state of, yeah, I could write that email. Oh yeah, I can play this guitar piece. Got it, got it wired, know it. So we can enjoy it. That's what we mean by that confidence, and it needs to be developed. And how do we develop it? By constantly making a change out of the criticism into the nurturing. So do you think you can practice nurturing yourself? You're an okay kid, you're all right, no problems. You don't have to do anything to be okay, you're already okay. Or as the Zen people would say, you're already enlightened. Just enjoy the fact that you're already enlightened. What does that mean? That means that you've just lightened up. Criticism, that's heavy.

**Speaker B:** All right, so setting aside the problem of whether it's good enough or not.

**Speaker A:** Right, that's what we're looking for, is enough, sufficient. Just enough. Okay, because if we've got enough, then that's being satisfied. We're satisfied with just enough. That satisfaction then leads to the feeling of success, safe, secure.

**Speaker B:** And it doesn't matter because we don't have anywhere to go anyway.

**Speaker A:** Vajrayana. Just enjoy. Excellent. Well, Aaron, let's stop now. Do you have any questions about what we've been talking about?

**Speaker B:** Um, no, but I look forward to listening to this again.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, go practice this. Go spend your time, set it up for yourself, maybe 6 times a day. Like when you first wake up in the morning in bed, you can take 10 minutes and just enjoy the heck out of not having to get out of bed yet. When you go to bed at night, before you go to sleep, you can practice, 'Oh, this feels so good. What a wonderful night. I don't even have to sleep. I can just lay here and just enjoy the heck out of just breathing and being happy. So those are good times of the day. And then there's other times you can figure out at lunch break or coffee time or whatever. Instead of going and having a smoke, you have a joy.

**Speaker B:** Instead of scrolling on my phone.

**Speaker A:** All right, Aaron, well, thank you so much. This has been a good talk. I really have been enjoyed our time together.

**Speaker B:** All righty, Dhammarato, good to talk to you.

**Speaker A:** Okay, we'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I hope so.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) in conversation with Aaron (Speaker B), centers on overcoming lifelong habits of self-criticism and dissatisfaction by cultivating self-nurturing and friendship. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Problem: The Habit of Criticism**
*   We are conditioned from early childhood (ages 3-6) to follow rules and be criticized, first by parents/teachers, then by ourselves. This replaces the initial nurturing bond we had as infants.
*   We internalize this as a state of "twin victimhood": 1) feeling we can't take care of ourselves, and 2) being critical, doing things without enjoyment.
*   This critical mindset leads to constant dissatisfaction (*dukkha*), which is often subtle—not intense suffering, but a background of discontent.

### **The Buddha's Essential Teaching: From Criticism to Nurturing**
*   The entire Dhamma can be summed up as **dropping criticism and learning to nurture ourselves and others**.
*   True spiritual friendship (*kalyāṇamittatā*) is the whole of the path, which includes becoming a friend to ourselves first.
*   We must learn to love ourselves **unconditionally**, not only when we meet our own standards.

### **Practical Application in Meditation & Life**
*   **In Meditation:** When your mind wanders from the breath, the correct response is **"never mind, start again"** with a gentle, nurturing attitude. The crucial moment is to **congratulate yourself** for noticing the wandering, not to criticize it.
*   **The Method:** The Eightfold Path is better understood as a **method**, not a journey. Its core practice involves three interwoven elements:
    1.  **Right View (Seeing):** Remembering to look at the present state of the mind (a verb, not a fixed opinion).
    2.  **Right Effort:** Applying the precise, minimal effort needed to change an unwholesome state—like stepping off the road to avoid a truck, not fighting it or letting it hit you.
    3.  **Right Mindfulness:** Remembering to apply this method again and again.
*   **Changing Mental Habits:** We must actively replace unwholesome, critical thoughts (often about past/future) with wholesome, nurturing thoughts about the present ("I am safe right now," "This breath feels good").
*   **Practice Frequency:** It's more effective to practice **shorter sessions (5-15 minutes) many times a day** than one long session. The goal is to repeatedly return the mind to a joyful, bright state (*sukkha*) and carry that mood into daily life.

### **Key Insights and Analogies**
*   **Precepts vs. State of Mind:** Moral precepts (not killing, stealing, etc.) naturally arise from a clean, bright, friendly mind—they are not imposed critical rules.
*   **Confidence (*Śraddhā*):** Practice builds evidence-based confidence—the "I can do this" feeling—which unifies the mind.
*   **The "Mathematics" of Comparison:** We must stop using mental symbols of comparison (greater than, less than, equal to) and replace them with the "heart symbol"—seeing ourselves and others with friendly, non-competitive appreciation.
*   **Handling Difficulty:** Start practicing in seclusion with easy "weights." As skill grows, use life's inevitable challenges (sickness, insults, old age) as opportunities to practice staying satisfied under pressure.
*   **The Job is Done:** The real work is not solving all problems, but **arriving at a state of having no problems** in the present moment. "No place to go, nothing to do."

### **Conclusion: The Path of Joy**
The talk encourages a radical shift from a life driven by internal criticism to one centered on self-friendship and joy. By constantly remembering to see our state, make gentle adjustments, and congratulate ourselves, we can break the habit of dissatisfaction and discover that we are already "okay" and capable of enjoying life without conditions.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses a rich tapestry of **metaphors and stories** to explain the core Buddhist teaching of moving from self-criticism to self-nurturing. Here is a breakdown of the primary ones:

### Core Metaphors & Analogies

**1. The "Dumb Animal" Metaphor**
*   **Description:** The transition from a nurtured infant to a criticized child turns us into a "dumb animal" that is told what to do without choice, and crucially, without being taught *how to feel* about the task. This creates a lifelong pattern of compulsory, joyless action.
*   **Purpose:** To illustrate the twin victimhood we carry into adulthood: dependence followed by criticism.

**2. The Meditation Instruction: "Never mind, start again."**
*   **Description:** This phrase from S.N. Goenka is used as a microcosm of the entire practice. When the mind wanders in meditation, the habitual, critical response is to "beat the tar out of ourselves." The correct, nurturing response is to gently say, "never mind, start again."
*   **Purpose:** To provide a simple, repeatable model for replacing self-criticism with self-friendship.

**3. The Kusala Grass Knife**
*   **Description:** The Pali word *kusala* (wholesome/skillful) is etymologically linked to a type of thick grass that, when dried under pressure, becomes a sharp knife suitable for cutting.
*   **Purpose:** To redefine "wholesome" not as a moral rule, but as a quality of mind that is sharp, discerning, and capable of "cutting through" or diagnosing a problem (like a diagnostic tool).

**4. The Weightlifting / Gym Training Analogy**
*   **Description:** The practice is compared to building a muscle at the gym. You start with light weights (short, manageable meditation sessions) and consistently repeat the exercise. You don't start with heavy weights (long sittings or confronting major life issues) because you'll fail and become discouraged.
*   **Purpose:** To emphasize gradual, consistent skill-building and to critique the common Western approach of long, arduous meditation sessions that can lead to dullness or frustration.

**5. The Alarm Clock Analogy**
*   **Description:** The human being is compared to a complex, old-fashioned alarm clock that has become dirty and dysfunctional. The practice is to dismantle it (examine body, feelings, and mind), clean it (remove hindrances), oil it (nurture), and reassemble it so it functions correctly.
*   **Purpose:** To frame the Dhamma practice as a methodical process of cleaning and tuning our internal machinery, not as a philosophical belief system.

**6. The Oncoming Truck & "Right Effort"**
*   **Description:** Right Effort is explained through the metaphor of seeing a truck barreling toward you.
    *   **Too little effort (Vajrayana/Choiceless Awareness):** Let the truck run you over.
    *   **Too much effort (Mahayana/Noting - like Popeye):** Try to stop the truck with brute force and get run over.
    *   **Right Effort (Theravada):** Simply and efficiently step out of the way.
*   **Purpose:** To define "Right Effort" as the precise, minimal effort needed to replace an unwholesome thought with a wholesome one—"getting out of your own way."

**7. The Door and Key**
*   **Description:** The Eightfold Path is not a long journey but a method. It's like a door right in front of you. Right View/Sati (awareness) is the key, Right Effort is turning the key and pushing the door open.
*   **Purpose:** To demystify the Eightfold Path, portraying it as an immediate, actionable set of tools for liberation in the present moment.

**8. Replacing Mathematical Symbols with a Heart**
*   **Description:** Our critical mind constantly uses mental equations: A > B (I'm better), A < B (I'm worse), A = B (comparison). The practice is to first stop using > and <, then to stop using = (comparison altogether), and finally to insert the heart symbol: **A ♥ B**.
*   **Purpose:** To vividly illustrate the shift from a comparative, competitive mindset to one of unconditional friendliness and non-comparison.

### Key Stories & Anecdotes

**1. The Maternity Ward Bonding Story**
*   **Description:** The speaker describes the celebratory moment after birth when the cleaned baby is brought to the mother in her room, creating a powerful chemical bond. This natural nurturing is what we instinctively pine for after it's replaced by criticism.
*   **Purpose:** To ground the need for nurturing in a biological, universal human experience.

**2. Teaching Children (Checkers, Piano Lessons)**
*   **Description:**
    *   **Checkers:** The speaker recounts teaching his daughter by giving her moves back and showing her consequences, making it a nurturing learning experience.
    *   **Piano:** A child who learns "Chopsticks" easily may develop joy and motivation, while one forced through scales without joy finds it drudgery and quits.
*   **Purpose:** To contrast nurturing education (which leads to joy and mastery) with critical, compulsory education (which leads to resistance and aversion). It shows how we internalize the "ruler" and use it on ourselves.

**3. Bobby Fischer vs. Boris Spassky (1972 World Chess Championship)**
*   **Description:** The speaker details how Fischer intentionally irritated Spassky by hovering over pieces without moving them and looking over his shoulder—tactics designed to trigger emotional disturbance and impair rational thought.
*   **Purpose:** To prove that negative feelings (anger, frustration) directly hinder clear thinking, a core reason why purifying feelings is essential to the path.

**4. The Grandmaster Playing a Child**
*   **Description:** A world-champion chess player doesn't compete with a child; they mentor them, sometimes letting the child win to nurture their interest and joy in the game.
*   **Purpose:** To illustrate that true security and confidence eliminate the need for competition. When you are not afraid, you can nurture others without feeling threatened.

**5. The Person in the Firing Squad**
*   **Description:** The ultimate test of practice is being able to stay satisfied even in the most extreme circumstances, like being the one standing without a gun in a firing squad.
*   **Purpose:** To frame the entire training as preparation for life's inevitable difficulties—sickness, old age, and death—by building the skill to find satisfaction independent of conditions.

### Overall Narrative Arc
The talk itself follows a **story arc** from the **origin of the problem** (loss of nurturing, imposition of criticism in childhood) through the **mechanism of its perpetuation** (internalized rules, self-criticism) to the **practical solution** (the method of the Eightfold Path, framed through these accessible metaphors). The metaphors collectively build the case that the Dhamma is a practical, psychological toolkit for undoing a deep-seated cultural and personal conditioning.
