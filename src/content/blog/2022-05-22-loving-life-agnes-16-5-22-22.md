### Transcript


**Speaker A:** This is useful, this is good for students. I want to go ahead and— Okay, Agnes, anyway, sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you there. Go back and start talking about how, when that you were at a state of procrastination and saying, "I'll do it tomorrow." 'it'll get done tomorrow' and 'I'm not up to it now' and that kind of thing. And take it from there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it seems to be some kind of pattern in my life to have that kind of thinking, because I intend to do it, I'm into it, but I just don't start doing everything because I cannot see I don't see the urgency or danger in it. Some things I've been able to do it and when I get there, then I really do it. And then the meditation practice has been life-saving for me at such times because it comes into question of life or death for me and it's very liberating to see that too and then the happiness comes and everything kind of— but at that time when I started doing it I also had a lot of fears coming up but there was this basic profound happiness in that, the peace of mind. I knew it was the right thing to do and I kept doing it. And from then on, I've been dropping things and stopped doing things along the way. But there have been some things that it's difficult for me to let go of.

**Speaker A:** Okay. All right. Well, let's take it from the perspective of I have been known to tell people that it would be a wholesome thought to say, "Well, never mind, I'll do it tomorrow." But that is in the sense of relaxation, and I'm saying that that's a wholesome thought, but it could also be unwholesome if in fact it is not freedom from fear, but it is based in fear. In other words, I'm afraid to do something, so I'm— and I don't know what to do, and I'm confused and whatnot. And so now I'll put it off tomorrow. So basically what we're really looking at here, Agnes, is your wisdom eye. Can you begin to discern and see the difference between what is wholesome and what is unwholesome, given that it almost is exactly the same words, but it's the underlying feeling and/or the feeling that it brings on, but it's the associated feelings that we're beginning to look at. That in fact, you keep talking about fear, and I'm going to tell you something about fear. Fear is the primary motivator of not just all the humans that I know— I suppose it's with every one of them— but it's also the motivation for the dogs, it's the motivation for the ticks, it's the motivation for everything, is driven by fear. Not only that, but one more thing about fear, and that is, is that it's fear that has been able to keep us alive and keep life itself progressing in the forms of evolution that has actually given rise to the birth of humans that gave birth to the rise of you and me. So we should be very pleased about fear. Except that when we experience it, we don't like it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right. But now I've even started missing it sometimes. Where is that fear? Because sometimes it feels like I need it somehow, because that would be this thing.

**Speaker A:** That was the motivator. Exactly.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Where is my motivation going to come from if there is no fear? The answer is maybe we don't need so much motivation, or maybe we can find motivation coming from doing, let us say, wholesome, useful, beneficial things. This is what Bhikkhu Buddhadasa would call the duty to the Dharma, but that is based in wisdom because we can see what value we can do for people. That in fact, I want to thank you at this point in time for pointing out again to me that this practice is actually useful, beneficial, and wholesome to you, and that that's my fulfillment of my duty to the Dharma, is to give this freedom, to make it available to others. That's how grateful I am for it. But this is based in wisdom And the wisdom also has the quality of being free from this fear. But we have to really know it first.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And the problem with fear is, is that we have been doing any and everything throughout our whole lives to avoid it because we don't like it. And we wind up having to deal with it on a regular basis. It's almost like it's chasing us wherever we go. Or another one would be that we're in the habit of running away from fear.

**Speaker B:** I guess sometimes I come to a point, perhaps it's about that, I come to a point I don't want that fear, so I keep doing what I'm doing to not have to deal with it.

**Speaker A:** Right, okay. So this is then the hard part, is to understand first intellectually, and then at a kind of deeper level, that fear is actually our ally. Fear is actually a friend. Fear has kept me alive, because otherwise I would have been too stupid to survive. But, and I have done some pretty stupid things. But I stopped doing some of those stupid things because fear drove me to stop. That what I'm doing is too dangerous. Okay. And I survived because of that. Now that I can see things wisely and recognize, among other things, to stay off and stay away from high-speed motorcycles, just stay off of them. Because once I'm on it and once I'm down the road, that throttle is—.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no more fun.

**Speaker A:** Now with that, right now we've got it too much on and there's— and it's dangerous. Okay, so that whole wisdom thing is, is let's avoid that whole circumstance so that I won't have to deal with the fear that I would put myself into. Okay, so this is, this is now the wise way of looking at it. And there's many things like that, like with alcohol One of the qualities that we can— you can probably recollect and remember this, and that is that if you buy alcohol at the store and bring it home, it's a whole lot harder to resist once it's at home. But if you resist buying it at the store and don't bring it home, then it's easier at home to resist the alcohol.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because I've already decided to drink when I buy it.

**Speaker A:** That's right, right. And the same thing is true with smokers, that the strongest case of someone actually quitting smoking is when a pack of cigarettes is still open, half full, and they quit so solidly that they— that pack of cigarettes, they after a few weeks throw the pack out because it's stale and old and But that's unusual. Most of us need to wean ourselves with things like staying away from it with wisdom so that we can get over it, because in the moment that we would be weakest, it's not available to us.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** All right. And we can see how wholesome that is to use wisdom to avoid fear.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah.

**Speaker A:** So with that, we can say, I can procrastinate now. But now, instead of— hang on a second, I've got to go take care of— go get her, go get her. Sorry about that. We've got a great big dog being accosted by a brand new puppy that's too stupid to recognize she's in danger. Perfect example of what we're talking about here. And so the daddy had to go in to intervene because he was the only adult in the room. Okay, so can we see dangers coming so that we can avoid them in advance? That's part of the practice now, is working with the wholesome. And you've come quite a ways around along with that. This is kind of clearing up some of the confusions, but it's almost a linguistic confusion because you can tell the difference between procrastinating something that needs to be done but you're afraid of it and you don't like it and you're postponing it and you're not sure what you're doing, versus the wholesome side of that is that that stuff doesn't really need to be done right now anyway. Why am I pestering and bothering myself with all of that fear and whatnot when I can in fact relax because there's really nothing to it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so there's— that's the wisdom. Is, in fact, we can think of the wisdom, the key for that then is, is do we see whatever it is as important? Okay, because in fact, you know about the teachings of the Buddha with especially the point about Sunyata. Is when we can make things empty, especially empty of importance, which means also empty of value, empty of meaning, empty of purpose, and empty ultimately of, let us say, a soul or an existing being or an inherent property. Okay, and in that sense, we— you've heard the story of the chariot.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, you told me last time. Yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** Okay, the story of the chariot means that there's no inherent chariot-ness there, that the chariot is a concept that was first put together with the human mind and then put together to match that human mind in the reality of it. But just like every automobile that has ever been manufactured had a prototype first, at least one, probably dozens, and the prototype didn't get done until somebody had drawings so that the prototype could be put together. And there was a lot of drawings. Okay, where did the drawings come from? Was out of some human mind, or maybe a whole lot of human minds. Working in collaboration. So the ultimate point is that an automobile does not really exist except in the human mind. If you took a brand new automobile and put it off in the jungle, what's the alligator going to think about that car? It's not a car to him. It may be a hidey-hole if he can get his way in. When we recognize that the reason why things are important is because we make them important. You have no doubt heard the line that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Basically what they're really saying is beauty is in the mind of the beholder, the one who looks and sees. Adds the beauty. So now we're talking about adding the importance, which then, if failure adds the fear, and if it doesn't have any importance to it, then failure has no importance either. And so where's the fear value, right? So this is how we can work it out intellectually. But now we have to start practicing this because the habit of making things important, failing and being fearful about failure, is a deeply ingrained habit in the human mind. Yeah, and we add importance to all kinds of things. Here's a clear example of that. Is the monk who gives his first public Dhamma talk important to him? Right. But after he's done 1,000 of them, one more Dhamma talk is not going to be important unless now he's got a special audience that he's never had before, like maybe the king of Thailand, or maybe 50,000 people or something like that, but he still manufactured that importance in his own mind. And that's what gives them then stage fright or butterflies in the stomach. The fear is done. And so the whole point is about practicing doing something over and over again, and then it becomes easy, it becomes routine, and then it becomes not important.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right. I experienced that in a way because I was scared to death to speak in front of people, but now it's not very dangerous anymore.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's because been there, done that, can do it. Okay, it has to do with a bit of confidence. So if we can see that it works in that one case, And in a way, it also worked with alcohol. It worked in that case. All right. That when you— when one first stops drinking, there's all kinds of fear about, I don't know if I can make it or not. I'm determined to die. I'm going to die if I don't do it. But I might die because I couldn't— could do it. Okay, exactly.

**Speaker B:** That's the point I came to. It was Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** All right, so now that we know that that's the case, we can say then that fear actually was loud enough to drive you into wisdom, to wake up and stop what you're doing because it's dangerous.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Yeah, that was— that's one of the things that happened with me on many, many different items, including motorcycles.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Even though we've got two of them here in the basement, but they're little step-through, uh, lady bikes. The 250 Sherpa was a downsize, but it was still very, very high quality, high-speed bike. But that was now— so gosh, that was 7 years ago when I got rid of my last superbike.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so it's enough now with the smaller one?

**Speaker A:** No, I don't even drive them though. No, I don't drive them at all. No, damn Tanha has them. I don't use them at all. I don't drive anymore. And the reason why mostly is because she doesn't want me to. She doesn't like it. She knows that I'm a speed freak. And even if I wasn't a speed freak, I actually enjoy that because now I've got a built-in chauffeur who will take me any place that I actually need to go. Yeah, I don't do things frivolous, so I'm not asking her to take me off to someplace. And in fact, most of the business that needs to be done, she just does it while she's out and about, like taking things to the post office and getting printing done and that kind of stuff. So I don't spend any time on the road anymore.

**Speaker B:** Sounds wonderful to have such a person around.

**Speaker A:** Well, it takes a bit of training. Yeah. And also willing to give up driving.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** To stop driving and let her do that because that's how she wants to do it. So, um, but we can see that with many, many things also, that once we see the danger in something, we're willing to do some remarkable stuff, to make a change. Okay, once I recognize that, hey, if you think that a teenage speed freak, well established in the neighborhood and knows where he's going and knows his motorcycle very well, is still really dangerous, think about that same kid when he's 75. And I recognize that danger, and I recognize that that's one of the things that I need not do, is to test that. And so we can say that then, that by not getting on the motorbike is exactly the same thing as not buying those donuts, or not buying those cigarettes, or not buying that alcohol at the store, because if it's not at home then we can deal with it easier. If you can take that one as a physical set of examples, we can apply that mentally also, so that we don't put ourselves in position that will cause us to be afraid. We begin to know where our limits and our boundaries are.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so it's a good thing to withdraw from things. I—.

**Speaker A:** Actually, going back to the point of importance, we start not withdrawing from things, we start withdrawing from the importance of things. So let's look at that in the way that the Buddha mentioned it in order to get started on this. And that is that he talks about it in the sense of the four requisites.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** The four requisites would be— because we, I think, have mentioned this a little bit before, so we don't have to spend a lot of detail on it— but the four prerequisites is adequate housing. Very, very few of us are tough enough to tough it out in the woods with or without adequate camping gear. It gets old. But even the Buddha moved into a hut. He started off in the woods, but he moved into a hut when somebody offered him a hut. Okay. So even for monks, have adequate accommodations. And in our life, you could say then that the adequate accommodations mean that the room itself, empty, you would not know whether a layman or a monk would live in such a room because they're about the same, just a basic room. Okay, maybe a small room, but a basic room is all there is to it. As opposed to what we have here is a ramshackle old shack, and we know the difference. One of the things that makes this a ramshackle old shack, and it hasn't been painted probably since it was new, which is about 100 years ago, and the floor looks interesting because we've had enough termites. This is teak, and it's hard for those bugs to eat. I mean, teak is fairly safe, but over time they eat through enough of the floorboard so that the repairman will come in and cut out just a tiny little section this big and replace it between the joints. And so we've got it all. It's not quite a checkerboard yet, but it sure is beginning to look like one. We've had so much. So, but it's still, it's adequate. That's the idea, is that it's good enough.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Don't need any more than this. This is what we've got is good enough. So adequate shelter, adequate clothing, adequate food, and adequate medical care. And Bhikkhu Buddhadasa adds a fifth element to that that he calls adequate entertainment. And if he's going in that direction, I would also add a sixth one just to spite him and add adequate transportation. Now, in the time of the Buddha, one's bare feet were adequate. Yeah, but not nowadays. They've got concrete out there, you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so what is adequate then depends upon the circumstances. But we also have to think in the point of how do we spend our time? And is the time— is the way that I'm spending my time, is this wholesome or not? And how I do my transportation, is it wholesome? Or not. But we can look at it in the sense of the— from psychology, they and governments use psychology and whatnot to talk about what we would call a poverty line. Yeah, a poverty line is such that in any one of these items, if you go below what you actually need to the point that you feel bad, then that's not adequate. Okay. Yeah. And so we need to move up to something that's adequate, but then we stop at the adequate just so long as it's comfortable.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's really helpful to— yeah, to think like this. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Everybody has a bottom line on all of these items.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yeah, I used to think a lot about that before, and it was really helpful. I need to come back to those things, I guess. And you're saying exactly those things now that I used to do and how I used to think, and I really got rid of a lot of things. I was very happy with that.

**Speaker A:** Is this good enough? Is this fine? We begin to treat the things that are projects and all of that as just a toy. Nothing's really important. That we do things just because we enjoy doing them without making much of a purpose out of it. Yeah, I, I, because— or make it important, because if we make it important and then we're not successful, then here comes the fear and here comes the bad feeling.

**Speaker B:** But, but unfortunately, perhaps they don't come anymore, the fear. I, I don't get any consequences because I have a mindset that it, it doesn't— it's— I don't really care. That's even more danger in that, I think, to kind of— Not if you're doing it wisely. No, yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** You learn to do that unwisely because you weren't paying attention to the fear.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Now that you're paying attention to the fear, you recognize that you can control that fear. In fact, you're having less and less fear. Yeah, but when it does come up, you don't like it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** You never have liked it. No, you didn't want to listen to it. And in fact, it almost— it was only to the point that it was about to kill you when it got fear enough, big enough fear, finally you listen to it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And now it can be a whisper. And you're still trying to avoid it. So here's the point, is that you can begin to listen to the whispers of the fear without it bothering you at all, so you'll actually listen. Let it be your teacher, let it be your ally, because it's actually not talking about what is to be avoided and what's dangerous. It's actually pointing out what's important. So when fear comes up, you'll begin to say, aha, what kind of importance am I putting on something here that I have attached myself to the point that I'm afraid?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, even those things that are of importance, I can see how I make it a priority even. It's even worse than important. I put it above.

**Speaker A:** Knowing the way that the Buddha works with things in the sense of Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, let's imagine that there is one thing that is important. What would that be? What is one thing That's important.

**Speaker B:** The Dharma.

**Speaker A:** Okay, we're going in the right direction. All right, let us go right to it in the sense of life itself is so precious that that's what's important.

**Speaker B:** All right, that's what's important.

**Speaker A:** And in fact, that was where the alcohol came into, is that in fact, which is more important now, the alcohol are life itself.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Uh-huh.

**Speaker A:** And I'm glad you chose wisely.

**Speaker B:** Me too.

**Speaker A:** See, you do like to be alive. It is the only important thing, is being alive. Okay, well, if being alive is so important, why is all of us in our society going around feeling bad, wanting things that we don't have, and living in this invisible existence when we could be enjoying that life that we find so precious?

**Speaker B:** Right. Right.

**Speaker A:** Isn't that interesting? Yes. Okay. The one thing that is important, we don't see as important. We find all kinds of stupid things to be important.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah. This is really helpful. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** That's it. Okay, so if we recognize then that, here's the next step towards Anapanasati, and that is, is that if life itself is important and we're going to start paying attention to that in a wholesome way, then we begin to recognize, wait a minute, there's a whole lot of stuff I can do without and stay alive. I can go without a job forever. I can go without riding a motorcycle for a long time. I can go without sex for years. I can go without eating food for 30 days or more. I can go without cigarettes. I can go around and go without water for maybe a day or two or three. How long can I go without a breath?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, very short time.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so that means then now that taking this next breath is part of that life itself, part of being important. Breath itself and breathing is important, and yet we don't teach that to children at all. And yet most of the problems that we have, most of the health problems that people have, have to do with breathing. Respiratory illnesses and respiratory thing. That's one of the three primary— actually, there's four groups, and that is, it's the heart that keeps the circulation system going, the lungs that keeps the circulation system pure or free in oxygen. The fourth group is to keep that circulation system replenished and cleaned out. That's the kidneys and the liver and the stomach and all of that kind of stuff. And then the fourth, the whole reason for having a circulation system is to keep the brain going. Yeah. All right. So these four major areas and breathing and heartbeat. Now, the thing about heartbeat is, is that lucky enough, it's pretty well automatic. But breathing is both automatic and mindful, and that oftentimes the automatic is not correct because we long time ago recognized as a species, as a survival mechanism, to breathe very tightly and shallowly or very little at all when we're afraid. Yeah, okay. That when we are breathing well, we are noisy. When we are alive, we are noisy. When we are fearful, we're quiet. Yeah, okay. Go into any business meeting with that thought and you can pick out who's in fear and who's not afraid. Look at the body posture, looking the way that they're protecting themselves, and then look at their breathing and recognize that their breathing is pretty well shut down.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so, okay, yeah, I never thought like that before.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, all right, so breathing then is the breath of life. All of this stuff from all of these religions are correct about it, that breath And breathing is life itself. And spirit. And spark. And like expire means to breathe out. And we also mean that breathing out is dying. That's one of the things they figured out, that the last breath is an out-breath. We don't breathe in and then hold it. No. Fire. So you could say, yeah, he's full of hot air until he dies, and then he has to let that go. So breathing is important, and we can see that from Anapanasati. It's life itself. And if we breathe really well, then we feel very oxygenated, we feel vibrantly alive. Paying attention to the breath gives us life, and it also kind of frees us from fear. And that if we are breathing well and we feel anxiety, we can chase that down with the breathing, we can find out where that is, we can manipulate it.. We can breathe into it and we can let go of it and stay in that vibrantly alive position. So this is why it's so beneficial with Anapanasati, is to think wholesome thoughts and breathe in a very wholesome way and just enjoy and relish being alive. Yeah. Oh, it's so nice to be alive. What a marvelous gift! Yeah, and we feel grateful.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I got that from someone somewhere. Yeah, and actually I was going to ask a little about that too. I've been thinking about that. Is it Is it the Buddha's teaching only? Is it specific for the Buddha's teaching, this thing?

**Speaker A:** Yes, this is definitely the teachings of the Buddha. I'm using Western language and New Agey kind of language and Christian language. Because it's part of our culture. But I have the basic foundation of all of this back into the Pali. But when people read the Pali and don't understand it, they don't make this connection, right? That this is the thing that I'm providing, is that this love of light is in fact getting ourselves into the First Jhana. This is it. Is being in that state of feeling gratitude and feeling alive and feeling safe and secure and comfortable and satisfied. And we know that we can do this and we know that we can get ourselves into this state often. And that's where the success that I've made it, I can actually be alive and really enjoy it. Well, what else is there to want?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, now I come to the first thing I wrote down as a question. When I come to this state, when I start, I get confused and I start doubting things and so on. Is that doubt about the teaching? Could one say that I'm doubting the the Buddha's teaching discussion with Dhammarato? Is that what it's about, or is it another kind, some other kind of doubt? Is it one of the hindrances in that way?

**Speaker A:** Any kind of doubt is that way. We can express it that way. That's one of the ways of expressing it. However, if we look at it from wisdom, we can say that the doubt that you're having is not about the actual teachings of the Buddha, because if you were dwelling in the absolute teachings of the Buddha, you wouldn't be in doubt. But if you are in doubt, that means that you're in doubt about what is the teachings of the Buddha. Okay. Okay. So it's doubt about the teachings, doubt about the teacher, doubt about your capabilities, doubt about Does anybody make it? In other words, we become very, very skeptically doubtful about all kinds of things. And that's a kind of a miserable.

**Speaker B:** Position to be in.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. To be in that state of doubt, and we're confused and doubtful about all kinds of stuff. And it's good to remember to look at that and say, hey, why do I bother to be in such a state of doubt when I could take the next breath and really enjoy the moment? Because I don't need to know any of that stuff. That in fact, in our culture, We have been told that you have to know everything. We also have greed for knowledge, that we want to know. That in fact, in our culture, it's thought about that knowledge is valuable. Knowledge is important. But if I know something that you don't know, then I can take advantage of you. This is the competitive environment. Okay. This is Zen, or not Zen, The Art of War from ancient China. Anicca is the everything is deceptive.

**Speaker B:** Go ahead. I actually dropped a lot of that. I dropped most of that, I would say, because I don't really want— that's also something I start feeling. Where is that fear to help me kind of get engaged in something.

**Speaker A:** Here? So your good practice then is modifying that doubt already, that you are in fact not so riddled with doubt the way that you were, say, 20 years ago. Exactly. But the doubts are still there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So I started thinking about— because this I've been thinking a lot about too— that for a long time I was actually thinking about, you know, that becoming an a nun or something.

**Speaker A:** And then I— Everyone does. Okay. Everybody does that.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah, but then I came— Only.

**Speaker A:** Some of us are stupid enough to actually do.

**Speaker B:** It.

**Speaker A:** But okay, so if you think about it like that, when we begin to really see the Dukkha as a really, really great big important thing, it comes very much like the issue with the alcohol in the sense of I've got to escape from this. I've got to get this. My Dukkha is going to kill me and I've got to make a great big change. Yeah, okay. What I need to do actually is to change that thought. That's because I'm making the Dukkha too big.

**Speaker B:** Ah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. That's an unwholesome thought, is to see the Dukkha as a great big thing, because it's not the way that the Buddha taught. He says, aha, I see you. The dukkha is a very light.

**Speaker B:** Thing. I can really relate to that. I think that's what I'm doing. I start seeing too much dukkha.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right. Those times, dukkha, dukkha everywhere, and it's all to be laughed at. Rime of the Ancient Mariner, you know, not a drop to drink. Don't bother. It's just you know, don't drink it. And we do. That's the whole thing, is when we see our sea of Dukkha, we see ourselves drowning in that sea rather than seeing ourselves escaping from.

**Speaker B:** It. I think I asked about the hindrance because there are different things to do about them, right?

**Speaker A:** Well, yes, but there is one thing to do about them that is similar to all of them. And the first thing is to recognize that they are interrelated.

**Speaker B:** Uh-huh.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And so because they're interrelated, it doesn't matter which end of the snake you pick up, you've got a snake in your hand.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Okay. And so you can see the hindrances like, okay, this is the head, this is the tail, this is the stomach. Okay, like that. But the fact is, is that you pick up the hindrances like this. So the first thing is to recognize that we don't have to individually pick them out, but we can recognize that they have traits. And the traits of the hindrances is the thoughts that we're not thinking about what's happening right now, that what I'm hindered by is almost always either the past or the future, or some conceptualized timeless thing, but that is not right here in front of me, right here, right now. Yeah, okay, okay. That I feel like I've got a gun in my face, I'm imagining the gun that I feel bad about. There's no gun there. Reality of the situation is it's not here. Okay, so the hindrances is hindering us from being right here. Okay, that's what they have in common, is they have the common point of keeping us out of the present moment and also keeping us in bad feelings of sadness, fear, doubt, perplexity, worry, desire. All of that kind of stuff. But in the here and now, being free from hindrances, we can feel satisfied. Yeah. And we can do that anytime that we remember to. That's the whole point. If I remember, I can throw any of that stuff out. And one of the ways to remember it is, is that it's not heavy, it's not important. I can throw it out. It's just a thought. It weighs almost nothing. And it can be thrown out, and the next thought can be popped right into place, only the next thought is.

**Speaker B:** Wholesome. Sometimes I kind of know that, but I'm just kind of not paralyzed, but I just don't do anything.

**Speaker A:** Weigh it down. Weighted down rather than paralyzed?

**Speaker B:** Or what's the word? Blank.

**Speaker A:** Perhaps.

**Speaker B:** Blank? Yeah, something like that. I don't know. I just don't— I just sit and I'm There's some kind of empty— I don't feel anything. I'm just cut off.

**Speaker A:** How long does that last? 2 minutes, 5 minutes, 2 days?

**Speaker B:** It can last some time, not more than a few hours perhaps sometimes when it happens the most.

**Speaker A:** When it's happening, do you like it or not like it? Well, it's blank, so it doesn't matter, I guess.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. It's more like, well, okay, so what?

**Speaker A:** So since you didn't know it before you did it, and when you did it you didn't care, your caring about it must be after you came— come out of it. Now you're worried about it. Yeah. Okay, that is the problem, is the worrying about it. Because when you were in that state, you didn't give a flying rip, so there was no problem. Yeah, yeah. Right. And so if that happens again, this time you can add the wisdom to it. Hey, this is okay. I like this. Begin to settle into it.

**Speaker B:** Perhaps that's what it's about, because I'm actually practicing being lazy, I think. Okay. And it might be something like that because I start to realize, why am I doing this? Why am I— I can't bring up the energy anymore to do things that I start to see, why bother?

**Speaker A:** Exactly, that's the whole point of it, is to recognize that it really doesn't have any weight, so why bother? But you also have the old stuff coming back saying, knock knock, this is important now.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** You need to start hearing that, that that's not the real part, that's the old part, that in fact it really is okay for you to relax and take it easy. Okay, that if there is something to be done, then you will know that Yeah. And that you will want to do it because it needs to be done because you're acting.

**Speaker B:** Wisely. That makes a lot of sense. Yeah, that's really helpful. Yeah. Because I actually do some things and when I start doing, I feel, yeah, this is what I'm supposed to do. This.

**Speaker A:** Is enjoyable. This is good enough. So I'll do this. Okay. But when you're sitting there in that kind of nothing state— yeah, that I will tell you, Agnes, there are tens of thousands of people who are practicing meditation that if they hear this video, they would be jealous of you because they're striving to be able to get into that state. Okay. Okay, so congratulate yourself for being— get to get into a state to where nothing matters and I'm here but I don't care, and it'll last a while. So then stop hassling yourself that you're actually able now to accomplish something that many people would be jealous over, rather than hassling yourself because you're not doing what your mommy and your Aunt Grady and the Gestapo and the Swedish Guard told you to do, and the church. Yeah, that you have learned to do nothing. Finally, now you can enjoy your life. You can actually sit here and enjoy being alive with nothing to do. Just let it be.

**Speaker B:** Empty.

**Speaker A:** Right. And so it's okay to do that, really. It's okay. Yeah. What's not okay is to hassle yourself about it.

**Speaker B:** Later.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. That's the hindrances coming up right then and there, because it's expecting you to go do something in the future. You're wasting your time. You ought to be You know, blah blah. That's the rules. Okay. So begin to tune into those rules and recognize that, hey, you're free. You can't— you do not have to do anything because somebody told you to do it. The Buddha's got a whole list of them that's listed in the Kalama Sutta. That very, very famous one starts out with don't accept things. And here we've been accepting things since our childhood. All of the rules and all the oughts and shoulds. The Buddha says don't take any of that stuff because it's tradition, or it's part of the society or the social structure. Don't take it because it was written in some old book. Don't take it because you heard it advertised on television. Don't take it because your teacher said it. Don't take it because it fits in with what even you've been told before. Don't take it because it's all the rage now, or all of that. That the only way that we could accept something is through investigation, to really look closely. Okay, so now here you are really looking closely and getting yourself into a really, really nice state, and then later up pops this rule and you're not looking at it. Where did that thing come from? What am I supposed to be doing instead of sitting here with nothing to.

**Speaker B:** Do? I guess what comes up is some doubt about my ability to discern what is old stuff and what is new, because in my old life I didn't follow rules at all. I did not care at all, and I went against society, everything. It's the complete opposite to what I started doing after 22 years ago.

**Speaker A:** And here you've gotten into the Buddha-Dharma, and you're on all confused because the Buddha says that, hey, you were doing basically the right thing, but you went— you, you left the stuff because it needed to be left. You just went off in the wrong direction about alcohol. Yes. Okay, now you're coming back and doing that, and so it's okay to rebel against that stuff. But now you have to be clear about that these old rules that you're rebelling against are these old rules that it's okay to rebel against because you're okay now, that you're all right already. Yeah, now you don't have to go do something. Before, see, you were in a state of rebellion, that you were running away from those rules. Now you can sit down and laugh at them.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And another thing I can see how what I have been doing around other people actually works. And I'm very surprised about that. That's all the Dharma doing that, because I didn't know how to be among other people even. I wasn't very kind at all, but now what I do seems to be appreciated. And I'm kind of happy happy, and I think that people appreciate that too.

**Speaker A:** Well, we have talked about that in the past. I remember talking with you about that, that your only job is to be friends with the people.

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I've been— And it's working for you. What? And it's been working for you.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. And also in very difficult situations, when it was really, really new and difficult for me. And it worked. Not perfectly, but I'm amazed about the outcome that I'm really— I cannot understand how that could happen, but it works basically.

**Speaker A:** Well, you do understand it. I mean, we just talked about that, that you've been actually practicing dealing with people differently, and it's absolutely amazing how successful you are at it.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yeah, and it feels good. I can see the change in myself. About— actually, I went to see my mother. She's at an elderly care home and I can see how I treat her and think about actually with compassion. I've been having some time lately, I had some problem accepting and forgiving her and there was not much forgiveness. I had this problem on and off for a long time, but basically I've been kind of forgiving and kind. But now, a week ago or so when I went there, I actually did something I never thought I would do. I don't usually do things.

**Speaker A:** Practically. What did you do?

**Speaker B:** What did you do? My son discovered her watch. She started looking at the watch. What time? 'Oh, this doesn't seem to be working.' And my son checked and, 'No, it stopped. It doesn't work.' And I thought, 'Well,' I said, 'I can go and change the batteries.' And I wouldn't have done that before because I really didn't want to get involved with things in that way. But I did that. I was a little surprised about myself. Because then I would have to go back again, and I really don't like going there much. But I still, yeah, I can do that.

**Speaker A:** And so that was a really nice gift for your mom then. I bet she really liked that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, she likes that a lot, and she's so happy to see me. And yeah. And it's a practice for me with that, with her too.

**Speaker A:** Excellent practice. Yes. You know, Bhikkhu Buddhadasa says that when we are ill, when we are sick with a cold or whatever, that that's an excellent opportunity to practice. So with the old animosity and all of that that you talked to me about with your mom and your rebelliousness for everything. Now, when you go to visit her, now's the time teaching to practice. And that you can practice it from the perspective of the Buddha, that the Buddha— he has a lot to say about how we treat our parents. That we should be grateful because they gave us life. In one sutta, it's just an analogy, but he tells this guy, Even though you carried your mom on your shoulder around everywhere she wanted to go, still you would not fulfill your duty to her because she gave you life itself. Yeah, you'll never be able to repay that. Okay, so when we think of our mom, we should think of her with gratitude. But I learned a lot from my mom. She was a really great person and I can let her go. With that. Okay. And so you can go and look for the good things or the wholesome things about your mom, including the fact that when you come into the room, she's happy to see you. Yeah, she's glad you're alive, and you're glad that she's alive. And there you go. That's it. That's all you need. I mean, you got a starting point right there, and you don't have to go into the past at all. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And so that's the way to practice. Don't go into the past, stay here now with mom because she's really happy to see you, batteries and.

**Speaker B:** All. Yes, and also actually I can see how my son has been teaching me so much about things because he acknowledged that he kind of said it was a very good thing you said to grandma Because she said she was kind of worried about getting old and how hard, how difficult it was. And I said, you're allowed, you can be forgetful and you can be. And she really was happy to hear that, that she didn't have to do anything. And she can't do things, she said. And I say, exactly what you're telling me now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the Dhamma is for the.

**Speaker B:** Elderly. I'm amazed. Oh, my son, he seems to be seeing those things. I don't know where he got that from. It certainly wasn't from me.

**Speaker A:** I think I would, I would doubt that. I would say that he is probably be picking up from you, and you're not even aware that you, you're shining, and he can see your shine. He's even complimenting you on it. Yeah, sure. And he's, and he's had his own life that you and I have talked about him before, that he, um, and that he's a pretty smart guy. He's figured out a whole bunch of stuff on his own.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** So you can give him credit that he can see you now in a way even better than you can see yourself. You're still having some doubts. Yeah, just a.

**Speaker B:** Few.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And so you can see those doubts now and recognize, oh, I can handle that stuff with wisdom. And in fact, most of the stuff I have doubts about, I don't even really need to know because I know enough. Now, what do I know? I know how to be.

**Speaker B:** Happy. Yeah, that's also a thing. The saying in AA, happy, joyous, and free. Could that be? I started thinking about that in a way. I became happy when I got sober and started practicing the Dharma and so on. And then there was this kind of heavy stuff, but I was still happy in that. Then I started to realize I'm I'm kind of content with less. I can be joyous and I have those Jhana things going on. And it's more about the feelings in that, that they are less. It's not so extreme as it used to be. And then, but the freedom, the peace, I started to realize I never really wanted that peace because it's boring. And it might have to do, you know, not driving a motor but not doing, you know, those extreme things anymore. Doing anything. And for me, just doing this nothing in my state I described, I never wanted that before, but now I I start to realize it's a whole new world to let go, to get into the peaceful. Perhaps it's about that, because I never understood the peace. What is peace? What is this about? But now I started. It could be.

**Speaker A:** That. Well, you mentioned boredom. And we've made the connection between boredom and restlessness. And the Buddha talks about restlessness as both a hindrance in the mind right now and also an underlying tendency. It's one of the high fetters, and that will come up. In other words, that we get bored from time to time. And also we can recognize that that boredom comes with thoughts. And the thought that I began to have, in fact, this was a lifesaver for me, is that, oh, I'm bored because I'm not practicing correctly. If I were practicing correctly, then my practice itself would be not boredom. That would be the activity that I'm craving. Okay, to be happy, that's the activity that we need, some sort of activity. And if we have zero activity, then that restlessness is there. So we need to find a way of pointing it in order to learn to control it also, rather than just getting bored and I don't like this present moment. We can say, okay, well, I can practice then. I can take a deep breath. A deep breath, by the way, is never boring, especially if you have to wait for.

**Speaker B:** It.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Thank you so much. This is so helpful. Even if I don't get it in the moment, but it's something.

**Speaker A:** It does. It takes a while for this to sink in. Yeah, just like a dry cloth does not accept water right away, it rolls off. But if you keep putting water on it, it will soak in. Yes, don't worry, I already know that. That's why I'm willing to talk about it over and over again. And in fact, I really like to do that. Rehearsing the Dhamma.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So Agnes, I'm glad today was quite useful for you. Yes. If you get some of that doubt out of the way. Oh well, I don't need to doubt. Not important.

**Speaker B:** Right, right. Thank you so.

**Speaker A:** Much. See you later.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a Sangha friend named Agnes (Speaker B), revolves around the themes of **procrastination, fear, importance, and wise practice**. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Themes & Insights**

1. **Procrastination: Wholesome vs. Unwholesome**  
   - Agnes describes a lifelong pattern of putting things off, often because she doesn’t see the “urgency or danger.”  
   - Dhammarato reframes this: procrastination can be **wholesome** if it comes from a place of relaxation and wisdom (“This doesn’t need to be done now”), or **unwholesome** if it’s driven by fear, avoidance, and confusion.

2. **Fear as an Ally and Teacher**  
   - Fear is presented not as an enemy, but as a **primary motivator** and evolutionary survival tool.  
   - The problem isn’t fear itself, but our habit of **running from it**. By avoiding fear, we let it chase us.  
   - Wisdom involves **listening to fear’s “whispers”**—using it to detect what we’re making overly important, and then skillfully avoiding dangerous situations before they arise (e.g., not buying alcohol if you don’t want to drink).

3. **The Wisdom of “Emptying Importance”**  
   - Much of our suffering comes from **assigning undue importance** to things—projects, outcomes, social expectations.  
   - The Buddha’s teaching on **Sunyata (emptiness)** is referenced: things are empty of inherent importance, value, or soul. We add importance with our minds.  
   - By **seeing things as “not important,”** we disarm the fear of failure and reduce suffering.

4. **Practical Wisdom in Daily Life**  
   - **Adequacy over excess:** Dhammarato discusses the **four requisites** (food, clothing, shelter, medicine) and adds “adequate entertainment” and “adequate transportation.” The goal is “good enough,” not perfect or luxurious.  
   - **Preemptive wisdom:** Like not buying cigarettes to avoid temptation later, we can structure our lives to avoid triggers for fear and unwholesome habits.

5. **Breath (Ānāpānasati) as the Anchor to Life**  
   - The most important thing is **life itself**, and the breath is its immediate manifestation.  
   - **Wholesome breathing** oxygenates the body, reduces anxiety, and fosters gratitude for being alive. It’s a direct path to feeling “vibrantly alive” and entering a joyful, concentrated state (first Jhāna).

6. **Dealing with Doubt & Hindrances**  
   - Agnes mentions experiencing **doubt** and a “blank,” disconnected state.  
   - Dhammarato reframes this: the “blank” state is actually an achievement many meditators strive for—a place of no burden. The suffering comes **after**, from judging that state as “wrong” or “lazy.”  
   - All five hindrances (doubt, restlessness, aversion, sensual desire, sloth) share one trait: they **pull us out of the present moment**.  
   - The antidote is to see thoughts as weightless, drop them, and replace them with a wholesome thought or attention to the breath.

7. **Real-World Practice: Relationships & Letting Go**  
   - Agnes shares how applying Dhamma has transformed her relationships. She visits her elderly mother with compassion—a practical practice of letting go of past resentment and being present with gratitude.  
   - Her son notices her change and reflects her growth back to her.  
   - **Peace is not boring:** Agnes realizes that the peace she once avoided is now a “whole new world” of freedom. Restlessness/boredom can be met by returning to the breath or joyful practice.

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Fear is useful.** Don’t run; listen. It points to misplaced importance.
- **Importance is a mental creation.** Empty things of importance to find peace.
- **Procrastination is wise if it comes from clarity, not fear.**
- **The breath is life.** Cultivating joyful, grateful breathing is central practice.
- **Doubt and hindrances are overcome by staying present** and not believing the old, internalized “rules” from society or past conditioning.
- **The goal is happy, joyous, and free**—found in adequacy, gratitude, and letting go.

The talk ends with Agnes feeling reassured and grateful, recognizing that understanding sinks in gradually “like water on a dry cloth.” Dhammarato emphasizes **rehearsing the Dhamma** through repeated discussion and practice.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary speaker (A) uses several **metaphors** and references a few key **stories** to illustrate the teachings on fear, wisdom, and practice.

### **Metaphors**

1.  **Fear as a Motivator and Ally:** This is the central metaphor. Fear is described not just as a negative emotion to avoid, but as the **primary motivator for all life** (humans, dogs, ticks) and an **ally** or **friend** that has kept us alive through evolution. The problem is our habit of running from it.
2.  **Fear Chasing Us / Us Running from Fear:** The dynamic with fear is pictured as a chase: "It's almost like it's **chasing us** wherever we go. Or another one would be that we're **in the habit of running away from fear**."
3.  **Wisdom as Proactive Avoidance:** Using wisdom to avoid tempting or dangerous situations is compared to:
    *   **Not buying alcohol at the store** so it's not at home to resist.
    *   **Quitting smoking with a half-full pack** still in the house (the strong way), versus the wiser method of not making it available.
    *   **Not getting on a high-speed motorcycle** to avoid the dangerous situation and the fear it would create.
4.  **Importance as an Additive:** We "**add importance**" to things, like adding beauty ("beauty is in the eye/mind of the beholder"). Failure only brings fear because we first added importance to the task. Letting go of importance makes things "empty."
5.  **The Hindrances as a Snake:** The five hindrances (doubt, restlessness, etc.) are **interrelated like a snake**. "It doesn't matter which end of the snake you pick up, you've got a snake in your hand." The key is they all pull you from the present moment.
6.  **Teachings Soaking In Like Water on a Dry Cloth:** Understanding the Dhamma takes repetition. "Just like a **dry cloth does not accept water** right away, it rolls off. But if you keep putting water on it, it will soak in."
7.  **Breath as Life/Spirit:** Breathing is metaphorically linked to the essence of being: "**breath of life**," "**spirit**," and "**spark**." The last breath (an out-breath) is equated with dying ("expire").

### **Stories & Analogies**

1.  **The Story of the Chariot:** Referenced directly ("you've heard the story of the chariot"). This is the classic Buddhist analogy of dependent origination and emptiness (*sunyata*). A chariot (or a car) has no inherent, independent existence ("chariot-ness"); it's only a concept assembled from parts, existing in dependence on our perception. The speaker extends it to a modern **car prototype**, developed from drawings in the human mind, to make the same point: things exist conceptually, not inherently.
2.  **The Monk's Dhamma Talks:** An analogy about **importance and habit**. A monk's first public talk is hugely important and scary. After 1,000 talks, one more isn't important—unless he *makes* it important by thinking of the special audience (e.g., the king), which then creates fear again. This illustrates how we manufacture importance.
3.  **The Puppy and the Big Dog:** A brief, real-life incident during the talk serves as a **practical parable**. The "brand new puppy that's too stupid to recognize she's in danger" accosting a big dog forces the "daddy" (the adult) to intervene. This is a direct example of "seeing dangers coming so that we can avoid them in advance" using wisdom.
4.  **Carrying One's Mother:** Referencing a Buddhist sutta, the speaker tells the story of the Buddha saying that even if you **carried your mother on your shoulders** everywhere, you could never repay the debt of her giving you life. This story is used to encourage gratitude as a practice, especially in Speaker B's relationship with her aging mother.

### **Core Conceptual Framework**
Underlying these metaphors and stories is a consistent framework contrasting two paths:
*   **Unwholesome Procrastination:** Driven by fear, confusion, and aversion.
*   **Wholesome Procrastination/Relaxation:** Driven by wisdom, seeing the lack of true importance (*sunyata*), and consciously choosing to avoid creating fear and suffering.

The talk uses these vivid images and narratives to help Speaker B discern between these two states and to reframe fear from an enemy to a teacher.
