### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I just turned the video recorder on because we've been going at it. You mentioned the word about the weather and referred to it as bad weather. Yeah, weather as weather is merely weather. Wind blows, wall of waterfalls, all kinds of things happen. There's just— it's weather. Okay, the temperature goes up, the temperature goes down, the barometric pressure goes up, the barometric pressure goes down. But bad weather is not the weather that's bad, it's our attitude about the weather. We don't like it. That's an important point. In fact, it's possible you could learn all the Dharma you ever needed to know by just being aware that whatever the weather is doing is okay. Because no matter how you feel about it, you can't do nothing about it. Even if you worked at the meteorological place, the big ones, you still can't do anything about it. In fact, local 5-day forecasts are still beyond them. They just can't do anything about the weather. Except hate it and try to get away from it and go someplace else that you like. But then you can't stay there because you got to go back where you don't like the weather because the rules tell you you got to go back home.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, or you go to Thailand to have some nice weather, right? And then rainstorms happen anyway, right?

**Speaker B:** But I broke the rule. You're supposed to be There, I didn't actually break the rule, I just throw it out whole. It's a completely functional rule, it just doesn't be used in the Dhamma. This is called Sila Bhanta Paramasa. You've heard the word Sila before. Sila What it means is— can you hear okay?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I can hear you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yes, what Sila Bhassa Paramasa actually means is that we attach to the way things are supposed to be. Now, scientifically, we can use a language that is more familiar with us, and one of the words that we can use is imprinting. And that sometimes spectacular things happen, that the baby animal of one species will then get in line with the babies of another species. Yeah, okay, like a chicken will think that it's a duck, and sometimes kittens think that they're dogs because of the imprinting. Okay, and so we all get imprinted from our families. Another way of looking at it is called the herding instinct or the nesting instinct. And anybody who's going to be part of this nest has to follow the nest rules. And then in the situation of a herd, imagine that you've got a bunch of wildebeest close by, and then the lion has spotted. Now the wildebeest become a herd and they become tightly packed. Well, guess what? The wildebeests that are in the middle of the pack, they can't steer the pack from the middle of the pack. They're caught up in it and they can't go anyplace except where all the other people in the pack are going. You got to be out on the edge of the pack where it's dangerous in order to lead the pack. But otherwise, you just go along to get along. Okay, and so what the Dhamma is teaching is that, hey, we don't have to herd because there's nothing to be afraid of. We're the lion here. In fact, I don't have to follow the herd, don't have to be part of the pack, don't have to do what I'm told to do anymore. I could just do the right thing. And what is the right thing? I don't know, I'll figure it out. I'll investigate things, figure out what's going on, and then act accordingly, rather than going along with the herd. So that herd then, in a big sense, is actually the society itself. This is one of the reasons why so many of the various Buddhist traditions will recommend that students get into seclusion. To get away from it all. To get away from it all. You hear that? So what do Westerners do? They go to a retreat. Instead of getting away, they go some— something happened. I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but you're back now.

**Speaker B:** Well, I'm back. So this Sila Bhante Paramasa is also referred to in, uh, Eric Byrne, and Sigmund Freud knows it also. Sigmund Freud calls this the superego, and Eric Byrne calls it the parent ego state, and that parents actually fulfill two functions. One is that when a tender infant is born, the infant has to be nourished and cared for and taken care of. But by the time the child is 5 or 6, it's put to work: go to school, learn your ABCs, pick up your toys, do what you're told to do. And so the parenting changes from nurturing into critical parent, criticism. And then we imprint. With that criticism while we miss out on the nurturing. And we long for that nurturing the rest of our lives. It's almost like we got a hole inside, that we're missing something. And what we're missing is that nurturing. And so what we have to do is to take that critical parent mind state, this unwholesome, this finding discrepancies and faults and things like that, and change that into a nurturing parent where everything is okay, everything is fine. Here, let me feed you and I'll give you diaper change, and all is well, not a problem in the world. Okay, so we nurture the baby inside, the little child that we have that never really grew up. In fact, that's what the reptilian part of the brain is all about, that anterior cortex is just feelings. And we basically talk ourselves into feeling bad by being critical of ourselves and critical of the world. And the Buddha calls those unwholesome thoughts, also called a hindrance. And so what we need to do is to stop that, stop criticizing ourselves and start nurturing ourselves. Everything's okay, everything is fine, no place to go, there's no work that needs to be done, everything's okay, just relax, chill baby, chill. Now that chill baby chill, actually the Pali word for that is Nibbana. Just cool, just to chill, just to hang out. But most people have a magical definition of the word. But all it really means is just chill, just cool.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, also in one of Buddha Dasa's books, I don't know which one it was, I think it was like, "Quenching without remainder," or something like that. He also described Dukkha like a blast furnace. And like the Nibbana also, like just the absence of the heat of that blast furnace. And you also described that everybody that is at least somewhat mentally well, or at least not mentally, completely mentally ill, is sometimes in this state, right?

**Speaker B:** Like, yeah, sometimes we feel like a nut and sometimes we don't.

**Speaker A:** Because if you constantly were like in Dukkha, Dukkha, Dukkha, like nonstop, you would just go insane. People that have that.

**Speaker B:** Right? By suicide, die by police, uh, do something really drastic. You're so wrapped up in, in how bad you feel, you'll do anything to get out of it. And much of that will be fatal. Okay, you could also have aneurysms and heart attacks and all kinds of physical things that, in fact, uh, this, uh, one group of psychologists that I know of call cancer is nothing more than people eating themselves alive.

**Speaker A:** Or fighting against themselves, right?

**Speaker B:** Critical of themselves, critical of the world, wanting things to be different, wanting things to be better. And the real teaching of the Buddha is learning to be satisfied with the way things are right now. Everything's okay, everything is fine.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I think that's really like you of course also said that like multiple times, but it's like really the main thing that is lacking from Western Buddhism, right? Is this clearing of the mind and not just observing like because that was what I was doing like with the Samhara meditation was observing. Can you still hear me? There's a motorbike in the back.

**Speaker B:** No problem.

**Speaker A:** No problem. All right. And that was really what I was lacking the most. Like, as soon as I heard that teaching and applied it, like, it worked like really well and got me actually out of like a long state of depression. And yeah, it's like without that, I think some people probably still get into that state by accident, by just sitting there long enough and observing things until they are fine with them. It's not really the most direct path, right?

**Speaker B:** That sounds like the story of Eckhart Tolle. Have you ever heard that name?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but I don't know the story.

**Speaker B:** Okay, he sat on a park bench in London. I don't know how many hours a day, but he just decided that he'd had enough of it all and he just sat down and kind of watched the river, what watched the River Thames for about 2 years, and all of a sudden he recognized, "Hey, I feel pretty good, because I've got nothing to do and no place to go, so I can just sit and watch what's going on." That's basically all there is to it. I know that there's a whole lot of philosophy and all of that, that people in the West get wrapped up with, with Buddhism. With Buddhism, making it quite complicated. So in fact, it's really simple. The Buddha said that he only taught one thing: Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. But then we get into those philosophical questions about what is the self and what is the soul and all of this confusion, to where in fact we don't need to care about any of that stuff. Just in fact, the one That thing that cares, that's the selfishness. And if we don't care, then everything is okay.

**Speaker A:** It's really like, it seems like 95% of the teachings in that sense, like in terms of the volume of sentences or whatever, it's really just necessary because of all the wrong ideas, right, that are wrong theories that people come come with like all the baggage that just needs to be said like, okay, now you think it's this way, but it's not this way. If we just came in fresh without all these concepts, like it would really not need that much teaching discussion with.

**Speaker B:** Like all the baggage that just needs.

**Speaker A:** To be said like, okay, now you.

**Speaker B:** Think it's this way, but it's not this way. If we just came in fresh without all these concepts, like it would really not need that much teaching discussion with like all the baggage that just needs to be said like, okay, now you.

**Speaker A:** Think it's this way, but it's not this way. If we just came in fresh without all these concepts, like it would really.

**Speaker B:** Not need that much teaching discussion with like all the baggage that just needs to be said like, okay, now you.

**Speaker A:** Think it's this way, but it's not this way.

**Speaker B:** If we just came in fresh without all these concepts, like it would really.

**Speaker A:** Not need that much teaching discussion with.

**Speaker B:** Like all the baggage that just needs to be said like, okay, now you think it's this way, but it's not this way. If we just came in fresh without all these concepts, like it would really not need that much teaching discussion with.

**Speaker A:** Like all the baggage that just needs.

**Speaker B:** To be said like, okay, now you think it's this way, but it's not this way. Whatever he's doing, there they are way on the other side of the pasture. And so he's going to go over to the cows. If he keeps his eye on the cows, making sure that he knows exactly where he is so that he can make adjustments in his path and walk right to them, he's going to be covered with cow shit when he gets there. What he needs to do instead is just get the general idea of where the cows are and then start watching every step because this pasture is full of cow pies. And so he needs to watch every step. And some of the cow pies are fresh and steamy, and some of them are old and deceptive because they're crusty on the outside and wormy on the inside. You know the kind. Okay, so yeah, and those are the kind of thoughts that we have also. So that's the way of doing it, is that we don't have to watch for the destination. We've got the general idea of what the destination is. What we need to watch is every thought, every step.

**Speaker A:** Well, like in the language of computer scientists, like no dynamic programming, just greedy algorithms all the way, right? Just.

**Speaker B:** Yes. Well, one of the things that one of the cowpies out there is, is that, oh, I have to watch for every cowpie, and if I see a cowpie, I gotta feel bad, rather than say, oh, out of the way, I'll just step aside. And so basically, people beat up on themselves. Goenka talks about that a lot in his retreats when he says, "If the mind wanders away from the breath, never mind, start again. Go back to the breath and start again." But the students don't do that "never mind, start again," they say, "Arahant, you can't do this meditation, this is hurting, I don't know what's going on here, I don't know," and then they just go right down the sewer of bad feelings. And all we have to do is to see that we're going in that direction and stop that and say, never mind, start again. Another example is, is that when we fall down, instead of just laying face down on the pavement, we just pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and boogie on down the road. No need to fuss at ourselves. Nurture ourselves instead. Let's not have unwholesome thoughts, let's have happy wholesome thoughts.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's kind of like realizing that in the moment something that should have hurt because it was unwholesome didn't hurt. Afterwards.

**Speaker B:** You broke up there, can you repeat what you said?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, do you hear me again? Because I don't see you.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I can hear you, yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Yeah, I just said like people— Can you see me? I can't see you.

**Speaker B:** How about now?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, now you're back. All right, so I said people have like a moment of Sati where they realize, okay, they weren't paying attention or they were doing some unwholesome thing. And thinking now that this unwholesome thing, doing this unwholesome thing should have hurt in the moment, but it didn't. So now they try to make it hurt right now when they're actually not doing this, right? When they are actually being mindful of the fact that they did something unwholesome, but by doing that they actually make it like, don't have the advantage of making it a positive feedback loop, right? Like, it should feel good when you realize that you did something stupid so that you are more likely to realize it in the future again instead of like making it hurt when you see it. It will just lead to you avoiding the seeing part, right?

**Speaker B:** Right. Okay. One thing to point out there is, is that when we use the word stupid, that's part of that critical parent. Okay. And so instead of saying that that was stupid, we can say, aha, I saw that. Aha, I see that. Okay. That's like calling the weather bad weather.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, using less judgmental language, right?

**Speaker B:** Yes. Congratulations for figuring that out. That's what— that's part of the teaching, is to recognize how critical we are with the choice of words that we use and our behaviors, our attitudes, and that winds up putting us in a victim's position. See, we were born as victims. We were raised as victims, we stayed victims, and when did you ever get actual permission from the society to be a fully-fledged adult? Nobody ever gets that much; everybody winds up being a child, or childish, rather than returning to that natural state of feeling all is well, because I'm well cared for, well nourished. We always are in that critical state. Oh, I've got to go do something. Go ahead. You froze.

**Speaker A:** You're breaking up. Like, maybe I'm gonna try to change networks here.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** So let's see, maybe this one is better.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I can see you. Yeah, you broke up for a little bit, but I can see you easily now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, this, all this critical thinking and like the parents being critical of their children. It's all basically the purpose of society to program its individuals in specific ways, right? So that we can fulfill roles and I don't know, so that society is able to produce stuff and wage wars and do all of this type of stuff. But we are not working in our own interest as human beings or minds. We are working in the interest of some larger principle, which is not a good one in this case. Like it's just a natural, or like, I guess, yeah, depending on how you define natural, like a process like evolution as well. It's just doing things so that genes get into the next generation, or in this case societies can like perpetuate themselves into the future. Breaking out of that By seeing that these rules are not for our own benefit, right?

**Speaker B:** That's the funny part, is the way that Western society now is set up, it doesn't actually benefit anyone. Even the most wealthy people are unhappy and disappointed, all because of the idea of the greed. Here's a way of looking at it. In the Suttas, there is the position that talks about that if you are really, really poor and in need, then that's not the time to get the Dharma. That time to get the Dharma is to get yourself up to a basic foundation to where you have just enough clothing, just enough shelter, just enough medicine, just enough food to stay alive at least. Okay. But we're looking at a poverty mentality. Anyway, and some people are just downright deficient and don't have what they need to do. So instead of practicing Dharma, their mind is completely consumed with the things that they actually need to survive. Okay. And so for that person, we need to bring them up to a level so that they can actually get physically secure, physically comfortable. Physically safe, because if we can't do that physically, then we're not going to be able to get the mind that way. The mind already knows that the reality of the situation is this is dangerous, and so we have to get the mind into a position of being able to accept reality, and the reality is that we're okay, we're safe now. And then we can practice the Dharma to get things really fixed up. Because we can now finish that. Now, here's something about society that way. We can look back in the feudal times, hundreds of years ago, that humanity was in pretty dire straits. A lot of people died early and all that kind of stuff. And so the whole thing about society was, is that we've got to get the whole population of the Earth up to a particular kind of sustainable level, that they're not well below the poverty level, they're at a high level of poverty. OK? Not yet ready for the middle class, but a lot of people are. That in fact, what we call poverty now is not the same thing as poverty way back when. An example is that this guy's only got 3 pairs of shoes, Well, back then they didn't have any at all. And so we see poverty as actually something 300 or 400 years ago would only happen to a rich guy. So this whole idea of poverty is, let us say, relative. But here's the point: Society has gotten itself up now to the level like the Gross Domestic Product, where all of the nations are comfortable. In fact, the only reason that sets us back is wars here and there. Because the reason people want to have wars is because they want more, they're not satisfied with what we've got. To where in fact, the world society now is already up to a level that we don't need to go after more and more and more and more. We've got enough now, and the whole world now will be able to change from that scarcity mentality into, "What are we going to do now that we all have enough?" Now, that's certainly going to happen in the future when AI and the robots and self-driving cars and all of these labor-saving devices come into play. There's going to be a change where a lot of people are going to be caught in the change, because they're still attached to greed, ill-will, delusion. But there's going to be a whole lot of people who are— one of the things that will happen is everybody will get really interested in sports, and that will happen for about 10 years, over a period of time. But eventually, humans will have everything that they need. Sufficient food, sufficient clothing, so then everyone can practice the Dharma. And so we got to plan for that future because there's going to be a whole lot of people that are looking for love, and after they find it in all the wrong places— or they don't find it because they're looking in all the wrong places. And for a couple of centuries now, we've been looking looking for love in the job. And now we're not going to have jobs to look for love because we got everything that the job was going to give for us. And so now what are we going to do with our time? Are we going to fight with each other? Are we going to do sports? Are we going to learn to hang out, chill out, and enjoy life?

**Speaker A:** Yeah. I also heard like a really good way of saying this, like that's now that humans are so much in control of such a large part of the planet's resources and using so much energy that really the determining factor of the outcome, like what the planet is going to look like in the future is really human psychology, right? So are we going to be able to fix our own psychology, then we are going to be able to fix all the other problems, whether it be climate change, distribution of wealth.

**Speaker B:** Ah, there's only one problem to fix though. Yeah, and that is the ignorance that there are problems. The fact is, is there really are no problems. That's coming from the critical mind. The nurturing mind, there's no problems.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, or the mind that isn't attached to specific outcomes, right? Like, for example, if one isn't attached to the outcome that you just described.

**Speaker B:** That you are going to have enough food, right? So the attachment and the clinging and want it to be different than it is, which is a way of using the word caring, that we care, which means we carry it around. It's heavy. Because it weighs heavy on the mind because we care about it. And it weighs heavy on the mind whether we care about it and we get what we want, or we care about it and we don't get what we want. It's equally painful because we care so much. I mean, here's a clear example of that, that they just had another election, a runoff in Georgia, And up until that time, when the Democrats started to cheer, before, both groups were in a great deal of anticipation: "Oh, is my guy going to win, or is that guy going to win?" And so everybody's uptight about the election, and then when somebody loses, then that whole group of followers are going to remain uptight; they're just going to change it from being uptight and anxious. Into being angry and miserable. But until the election happened, everybody who cares about that election is suffering. The people who don't care about that election, you don't suffer, because you don't care. If Warnock gets it, if Herschel Walker gets it, it doesn't matter. So why should we care? Not our business. And so we can get that attitude about politics, we can get that attitude about almost anything. Leave the world alone and be satisfied and happy, and then the world becomes quite an imagine— quite a, quite a three-ring circus, quite a show, because we don't care anymore about it doing this way or that way. We'll just enjoy it the way it is. This is why we care. We care because we like it or we don't like it. And so this actually, the meditation practice, is the practice then of learning to stop caring. What do we stop caring about? The things that we're caring about right now that are bothering us. Let's see that and say, aha, I see that caring. And then we don't have to do it much anymore. We can use it as a game to play or a toy to play with rather than a monumental problem, because there was no problems in the first place. There was just caring.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, thinking that things are important, right? That the way things are, whether it's this way or this way, that really matters a lot. Like, whereas actually, like Not really, right?

**Speaker B:** No problems, really. There's just no problems. We make problems because we care.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's like we are always like, whenever we use language, we are in the world of concepts, right? And like even the word problem even like has some specific expectations to it, right? Like for example, in mathematics, something is only then a problem if in theory Like you could, you can formulate it like, okay, it's, we use exact definitions, like what it is that we are actually talking about. And we are trying to prove something or disprove it, or like we make a statement basically, okay, this can either be proven or not proven, but there's some way of figuring that out, or at least figuring out that there might not be a solution to it. So In that sense, things are not a problem because they are not in the realm of things that can be solved by a single human being, right?

**Speaker B:** Exactly right. You could say it this way also: mind over matter. If you don't mind, it don't matter.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's also a good one.

**Speaker B:** That we actually do create our own reality. That's part of the teaching of Paticcasamuppada, is the things that affect us, that bring on our feelings, is something that we invented in the first place. It's not what we bring in is real. We try to figure out what it is by comparing it to the past, and when we compare it to the past, that's when we bring the selfishness into it. Because we were selfish in the past. And so the whole idea then is to stop taking the past to help you make up what's happening in the future. If you don't see what's happening in the future, just keep looking, just keep watching, instead of trying to figure it out. That makes it really easy. You don't have to know. Just watch. Just look at it. Just observe inside and outside and make friends with it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, what I also found like really interesting, like, was the thought about all this, like, worrying about the future kind of also has like already some assumptions within it, right? That like I right now, like whatever that is, that process can in some way gain a benefit from optimizing future circumstances. So, but even if you like can avoid something bad happening in the future, like yeah, it's going to benefit the organism or whatever. But you right now can only take benefit of it insofar that you say, Oh, this is a good thing that I did this. And then it can feel good because now I'm safe in the future. But yeah, it's like really this process right now does not have that type of causal relationship with the future, right? Like something, however it's going to be in the future, cannot affect how you feel right now.

**Speaker B:** Right, so this is part of the joy of the practice, is how do you feel right now? How did you get yourself into that state? Because then we can see that, oh, this is Dukkha. I don't need this. I could make a change, take the right effort and become wholesome again. That's all there is to it. And if you wake up and do the investigation and find out that you're already in a good state, then now the only thing to do is to congratulate ourselves. Wow, I was already in a good state! Isn't that amazing? And then we have the idea, well, I could do this anytime I remember to do it. Yeah, anytime I remember, I could get myself into that good state.

**Speaker A:** I think that's also, like for me, that was a really powerful change of attitude in the way I practiced was like when setting the timer instead of thinking like, oh no, I have to like do the 10 minutes of meditation or whatever, have certain expectations with it. I can allow myself now to not do anything and just sit here like all this other stuff that maybe comes up later again, I can really set this down. So it becomes more of a freeing thing. It's like really just so great, right? Like, ah, nothing to do.

**Speaker B:** Nothing to do. All right, well, let's finish this talk. I think that we've gotten some value because you're just about ready to go into the retreat at Deepa Bhavana. I think it's on the 11th. That's 3, 4 days from now, so why don't you just go ahead and check in the place and see if there's anybody at the office?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, we'll do that.

**Speaker B:** Okay, give me a call one way or the other.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** All right, Sebastian. Good luck, we'll see you later.

**Speaker A:** Thank you, see you later.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) in dialogue with a Sangha friend (Speaker A), centers on the core Buddhist teaching of **ending suffering (dukkha) by letting go of judgment, criticism, and attachment to outcomes.**

Here is a structured summary of the key points:

### **Core Teaching: The End of Suffering is Letting Go of "Caring"**
The central theme is that suffering arises not from external conditions, but from our **judgmental attitude and resistance** to them. The path to peace (Nibbana) is learning to be satisfied with things as they are.

**1.  Weather as a Metaphor for Life:**
*   "Bad weather" isn't the weather itself, but our dislike of it. We cannot control external phenomena (like the weather), but we can change our internal reaction. The fundamental problem is our attitude of aversion or craving.

**2.  Breaking Free from Societal Conditioning (Sīlabbata Parāmāsa):**
*   We are "imprinted" from childhood with societal and familial rules—the "herd instinct" or "critical parent" voice (linked to Freud's superego). This conditions us to seek approval, follow norms, and be self-critical.
*   The Dhamma teaches us to step out of this "herd." We don't have to follow blindly; we can investigate and do the "right thing" for ourselves, which often means being nurturing rather than critical.

**3.  Transforming the Inner Critic into the Nurturing Parent:**
*   We carry a "hole" inside from missing early nurturing. The practice is to transform the internal **critical parent** (which finds faults and creates suffering) into a **nurturing parent**.
*   This nurturing voice says: "Everything is okay. Just relax. Chill." **This state of "chill" is equated with Nibbana**—not a magical state, but a cool, peaceful abiding.

**4.  The Simplicity of the Dhamma vs. Overcomplication:**
*   The Buddha essentially taught one thing: the cessation of suffering (dukkha nirodha). Much of the philosophical complexity in Western Buddhism is seen as baggage addressing pre-existing wrong views.
*   The direct path is **learning to stop "caring"** in the problematic sense—releasing attachment to specific outcomes and judgments. "If you don't mind, it don't matter."

**5.  Practical Meditation Advice:**
*   **Watch every step, not just the destination:** Don't get fixated on a future goal of enlightenment; pay careful, kind attention to each present thought and step, avoiding the "cow pies" of unwholesome thoughts.
*   **"Never mind, start again":** When the mind wanders or you make a mistake, don't criticize yourself. Gently return to the practice without creating a story of failure. Nurture yourself instead.
*   **Use non-judgmental language:** Instead of saying "that was stupid," say "aha, I saw that." This removes the layer of self-inflicted suffering.
*   **Make practice a relief:** Sitting should feel like a chance to set everything down, with "nothing to do." This creates a positive, freeing feedback loop.

**6.  A Vision for Society and the Future:**
*   The discussion speculates that modern society, with its potential for abundance (via AI, etc.), could move from a **scarcity/greed mentality** to a point where basic needs are met for all. Then, the universal human task would become finding true contentment and learning "to hang out, chill out, and enjoy life" through Dhamma practice.
*   The ultimate "problem" to solve is the psychological belief that there are problems. All major world issues stem from the same root: ignorant craving and aversion in the human mind.

### **Conclusion in a Nutshell:**
The talk advocates for a profound yet simple shift: from a **critical, striving, outcome-attached mind** that creates suffering, to a **nurturing, accepting, present-moment-aware mind** that finds peace with "what is." The highest goal (Nibbana) is reframed as the accessible, everyday skill of learning to "chill" and let go.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use several powerful metaphors and stories to explain Buddhist (Dhamma) concepts and the human condition. Here is a breakdown of the main ones:

### **Core Metaphors & Stories**

**1. The Weather Metaphor**
*   **Description:** Weather is neutral—it's just wind, rain, temperature changes. "Bad weather" is not a property of the weather itself, but our **attitude** and dislike towards it.
*   **Purpose:** To illustrate that suffering (Dukkha) arises from our judgment and resistance to reality, not from the events themselves. The key teaching is learning to be okay with "the weather" of life as it is.

**2. The Herd/Pack Animal Metaphor**
*   **Description:** People are like wildebeest in a herd. When a lion (danger) appears, they pack tightly together. Those in the middle cannot steer; they are simply carried along by the herd's momentum. Only those on the dangerous edge can lead or change direction.
*   **Purpose:** To represent societal conditioning and the "herding instinct." Society (the herd) imposes rules and fears. The Dhamma teaches that we are the "lion"—there's nothing to fear, so we don't have to blindly follow the herd. We can step out, investigate, and act based on wisdom, not social pressure.

**3. The Critical Parent vs. Nurturing Parent (Psychological Framing)**
*   **Description:** This draws from Freud's "superego" and Eric Berne's "parent ego state." Parents start by nurturing an infant but shift to a **critical parent** mode as the child grows, imprinting rules and criticism. We internalize this critic and long for the lost nurturer, creating a "hole inside."
*   **Purpose:** To explain the inner critic and self-induced suffering. The practice is to transform this inner **critical parent** into a **nurturing parent**—soothing the inner child, saying "everything is okay, just relax." This nurturing state is linked directly to Nibbana (cooling, chilling).

**4. Nibbana as "Chilling Out"**
*   **Description:** Nibbana (Nirvana) is stripped of mystical baggage and described simply as "chill baby, chill," "cooling," or "quenching." It's compared to the absence of the intense heat of a blast furnace (Dukkha).
*   **Purpose:** To demystify the ultimate goal of Buddhism. It's framed as a natural, accessible state of peace and contentment that everyone experiences in moments when the mind stops struggling.

**5. The Cow Pasture / Cow Pie Story**
*   **Description:** A man needs to cross a pasture full of cow dung (cow pies) to get to the cows. If he only stares at the destination (the cows), he'll step in dung. Instead, he should get a general sense of the direction and then **watch every step** to avoid the fresh and the deceptively crusty cow pies.
*   **Purpose:** To illustrate the practice of mindfulness. Don't get fixated on a future goal (enlightenment, a perfect state). Keep the general direction in mind, but focus attention on the present moment—"every thought, every step"—to avoid mental "mess" (unwholesome thoughts).

**6. Falling Down & Getting Up**
*   **Description:** When we fall down (make a mistake, lose mindfulness), we shouldn't lie on the pavement and berate ourselves. We should just "pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and boogie on down the road."
*   **Purpose:** To teach non-judgmental resilience and self-nurturing. It echoes Goenka's instruction "never mind, start again," emphasizing that the unwholesome response is the self-criticism, not the initial lapse.

**7. The Election Example**
*   **Description:** Before an election, people who care about the outcome suffer from anxiety. After, the losers suffer from anger. Those who **don't care** about the result don't suffer at all. Their peace isn't dependent on the outcome.
*   **Purpose:** To concretely show that suffering equals **caring** (attachment, clinging) about specific outcomes. The practice is learning to "stop caring" about things that bother us, not out of apathy, but to see them as a "game" or "show" rather than life-or-death problems.

**8. Eckhart Tolle's Park Bench Story**
*   **Description:** Eckhart Tolle reached a point of despair, sat on a park bench for about two years watching the River Thames, and eventually realized he felt good simply because he had "nothing to do and no place to go."
*   **Purpose:** To provide a modern, Western example of how simplicity, stopping, and bare attention can lead to the core peaceful state that the Dhamma points to, without complex philosophy.

**9. Society's Programming for Scarcity vs. Future Abundance**
*   **Description:** Society historically programmed people with a **scarcity mentality** (critical parent, herding instinct) to ensure survival and production. However, we are moving toward a technological future of abundance (AI, robotics) where basic needs are met for all. The new challenge will be what to do with our time and how to find fulfillment without jobs to give us purpose.
*   **Purpose:** To contextualize our psychological conditioning within history and economics, and to argue that the Dhamma (learning to be satisfied, to "chill") is the essential practice for a future where material scarcity is not the primary driver.

### **Summary of Key Themes Through Metaphor:**
*   **Suffering is a Judgment:** Bad weather, the critical parent.
*   **Freedom is Stepping Out:** Leaving the herd, being the lion.
*   **The Path is Present-Moment Focus:** Watching your step in the cow pasture.
*   **The Goal is Natural Peace:** Chilling out, nurturing the inner child.
*   **The Mechanism is Non-Attachment:** Not caring about elections, mind over matter ("if you don't mind, it don't matter").

These metaphors collectively paint a picture of Dhamma practice as a practical, psychological process of letting go of societal and internalized criticism, embracing the present moment without judgment, and discovering a natural state of peaceful contentment.
