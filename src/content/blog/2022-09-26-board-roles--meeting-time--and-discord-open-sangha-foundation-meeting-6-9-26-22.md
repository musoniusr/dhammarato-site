### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right guys, welcome to the 6th Open Sangha Foundation meeting. We'll get right to it. The agenda that I had written down for today was the last meeting we talked about assigning roles for folks who want to be some sort of officer or position on the board of directors, like the board chair, vice board chair, secretary, and treasurer. Those are the 4 roles we're looking to fill. So in today's meeting, we're going to be voting on anyone who's volunteered for those roles. We also had some talk about meeting times. There were various variables that we were looking at. Ideally, we can choose a meeting time that— obviously meeting times are going to be inconvenient for someone. We're dealing with people all around the world, but find a meeting time that we can commit to and least convenient or somewhat least convenient to everyone. We're not going to find a perfect meeting time, but something that works a little bit. And then the final thing I had talked about or mentioned was some sort of business plan. This isn't like a formal thing, but start talking about— start getting the ball rolling about what we're actually going to be doing, like the practicalities of some sort. And also, yeah, Dhammarato started talking in some previous meetings about the different audiences we're going to be looking at. So starting getting that discussion going, and we can talk about anything else as well. So I guess we could start now with the signing of the roles for the board of directors. We, in the last meeting, we had prompted anyone— there was a document with 6 headings, 4 roles which we're going to be voting in. We asked, hey, if you want one of these 4 roles, if you're willing to volunteer the time to help the organization out by filling one of these 4 roles, say something in the board chat, and then in the next meeting we'll vote you in or vote the multiple candidates in if that's the case. The messages that were sent were from Tyler wanting to be The board chair and Joe interested in being the treasurer. If there's anyone else here who wants to fill in a role, the two other roles are secretary and treasurer. The secretary will be managing the various records for OSF. They'll be taking the minutes of the meetings. They'll be taking notes who attended the meeting, a rough outline of what was talked about. Maybe the different disagreements and the conclusions that were came to. Ideally, the secretary will be able to make all meetings because they're going to be taking the notes of the meetings and familiarity with the paperwork and stuff that we've been doing so far for the 501(c)(3). The secretary will need to have that familiarity. And of course, if anyone volunteers to this role, I'd happily help introduce them to the paperwork and such. And then the— yeah, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** I'd like to volunteer for the chocolate role. Did anybody get my joke? No, never mind.

**Speaker C:** All right, but the chocolate roll has to have the Wonketeer as the title.

**Speaker B:** Parker, I think it would be good if you would be the Secretary, and I really like the idea of Tyler being President. That sounds great. And thank you also, Joe, for being the Treasurer. Those are roles that need to be filled.

**Speaker A:** And I think I misspoke earlier. So the two we have for sure are Tyler and Joe as the board chair and the treasurer, and then we need a vice chair, which is someone who will fill the board chair role if Tyler is gone, and the Secretary, which I'd be happy to fill for now.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I would like it if you did the Secretary job because you're already doing all the stuff that a Secretary would do anyway.

**Speaker A:** It's right before I quit.

**Speaker D:** Got a telegram from her the day.

**Speaker A:** Before I got shot down. She said, just— I'll be the Vice Chair.

**Speaker C:** Man, I've never met him.

**Speaker D:** Awesome.

**Speaker B:** Who, who just volunteered for vice chair?

**Speaker A:** Cory.

**Speaker B:** Cory. Okay.

**Speaker D:** Also, thanks, Cory. One clarification on secretary. So I know it's like taking notes and being there at every meeting sounds like a lot, but I think the way what we're actually— that's like asked just for the board meetings. And the board meetings are going to be a lot fewer than necessarily every single meeting.

**Speaker A:** And Corey, could you mute your microphone?

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, sorry, thank you.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, so there are like board meetings and there's also kind of like meetings with everybody. We've been treating them as the same thing, but like something that we kind of discovered the process of setting this 501(c)(3) is that our required board meetings are actually a lot fewer. So I think we still need to take meetings at every single meeting we do with all of us, right? All these Monday morning meetings. But don't let that like stress you out or like deter you from being secretary of like, oh, I have to be here every week, my schedule's up in the air. I don't think it's necessarily going to be like that onerous or burdensome. So yeah, it would be nice if someone who wasn't Parker could do this because Parker has been doing a lot and it's really hard to like take notes and also kind of lead the meeting as well. So it'd be awesome if somebody else could volunteer for this.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that would be great.

**Speaker B:** Well, I would think that either Robert Cohen or Keishon could do that then.

**Speaker E:** I'd give it to the professional writer.

**Speaker B:** You just volunteered. Thank you.

**Speaker E:** Robert Cohen.

**Speaker F:** And this is for the Secretary role?

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker F:** My only issue is with the weekly commitment. I'm not sure I can make it every week because I travel a lot. So it's a little bit of a— yeah.

**Speaker D:** And Robert, that's what I was saying earlier, was that I don't think this is actually a weekly a weekly commitment. Like, there are— the board meetings are going to be a lot fewer than, um, these weekly meetings. Like, these weekly meetings are for like the whole, the full community to get together. Okay, so I think we'll find a way to like take notes during these weekly meetings.

**Speaker B:** Uh, in fact, we could do it this way also. We could put Keyshawn and Robert as co-secretaries, or Secretary A and B, or something like that. But I think that that would be okay. Or maybe just one's the assistant of the other and somebody puts your name in first.

**Speaker D:** Well, or maybe another thing too is just like having— if Robert, if you were comfortable being the secretary during like our handful of board meetings we have every year, which might only be like around 4 or something, like the really official ones, and then there's a bunch of like miscellaneous paperwork But then, you know, on these weekly meetings, if Robert and Keishon, if you guys could help find people to volunteer to take notes, that would be like super helpful. And so the burden isn't going to be only on you.

**Speaker F:** Okay, sure. I'm happy to co-secretary with Keishon.

**Speaker B:** I think that would be fine if he's up for it.

**Speaker F:** We can work it out. Official names, we can say we can trade or something like that. We'll work something out.

**Speaker A:** Wonderful. Great. So we have the board chair, which Tyler has volunteered to fill. We have the vice chair, which Corey has volunteered to fill, and we have the secretary. Which Robert has volunteered that we put his name down for that. And during the weekly meetings, the more community-oriented meetings, it'll be less strict as who's taking notes, rather just someone to take notes for the meetings. And Robert and Keishon can go back and forth on that. Secretary, and then the treasurer as Joe.

**Speaker D:** And just one thing I want to add to all this is that there is like a document that describes kind of what these roles are in more detail, especially the secretary one, because there's all like the legal requirements we have to do for like staying a tax-exempt organization. A lot of that goes with the secretary of like taking notes and recording votes and stuff. And so like there are like responsibilities which each of these things that are detailed detail in a separate document. We'll send those out shortly.

**Speaker A:** Yep.

**Speaker E:** I think availability with these weekday meetings might be kind of limited for me as well.

**Speaker D:** So yeah, just again, this isn't— the weekly meetings aren't the board meetings, and so we've been treating them kind of like as the same thing up until now. But like when we're actually having board meetings, those are going to be much fewer and farther between. And we'll make sure that everyone has availability for those, at least who's on the board. But I think for these weekly meetings.

**Speaker B:** We still need to go— yeah, we can arrange the call so that you guys can make it. That's the whole point. That's the way that we've been doing it so far, is to sign up to get a good time. And we'll talk about the time later.

**Speaker D:** But yeah, anyway, but I think for these weekly meetings, that doesn't necessarily always need to be on the secretary. That could be anybody from the community, or could all communally be taking notes. That's not just like a secretary job. So the secretary's jobs are a lot— it's a lot more limited than it sounds like from, you know, initially.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's more filling.

**Speaker B:** The formal role.

**Speaker A:** That the IRS gives or requires someone to take notes for the organization, take minutes. These are things that the IRS likes nonprofits to do. So that's what the role is.

**Speaker B:** I was about to mention that, and there's one more point about it, that it's ancient. It's archaic. A cane, and it's when women would come in and write things down the men said on a piece of paper with a fountain pen. All right, that's how old secretaries are. I mean, back in the Middle Ages, we've got videos now. The video— I mean, what better documentation could the IRS want than a video or the transcription of a video?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** And so that makes the secretary's job just dead easy.

**Speaker A:** Cool. So we have those 4 people willing to fill those 4 roles. Let's have a vote. We'll have a vote now. Raise your hand if you approve of the board chair being Tyler. The Vice Chair being Corey, the Secretary being Robert, and the Treasurer being Joe. Great. Okay, so now we can continue on the next train of thought that we are talking about is the weekly or biweekly meetings. We proposed the time, the time that we're talking now, Monday at 8 AM PST, and then there was some discussion in the main chat about this time is inconvenient for me or this time doesn't work consistently. Obviously the time probably is going to be inconvenient for some people and not work for some people some of the time, but I think it would be worth talking about it a little bit. Some of the variables that were coming up were having the time be on weekends versus weekdays. The benefits of weekends, maybe more people are available most the time, but Tyler made the point that it'll probably be less likely that people will be able to make the commitment consistently over a long period of time on weekends because that's a day that various things just come up for most people. And then whether or not we want this 8 AM PST time or what, 8 hours later in the day at Dhammarato's morning at 3 PM PST. So those are the things. If anyone has any points to talk about there.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I have a particular point that I would like to put in there, and that is that I would prefer it to be as convenient as possible for UK and US. And let the Asian be the third man out. So if it's at 2 in the morning or 3 in the morning, that's okay, because there's not going to be many of us making every meeting.

**Speaker A:** Wonderful.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so that's the way that I would schedule it, is perhaps late afternoon in the US versus evening in the UK or in Europe. Something like that would be, I think, the most convenient. For the most number of people.

**Speaker A:** So Joe and Robert, uh, uh, UK Robert, uh, what is— which is most convenient at this time? Or, um, I guess 3 PM PST would be in France. 3 PM PST in France is, uh, midnight for you guys.

**Speaker B:** This time is definitely more convenient for me.

**Speaker G:** For me, midnight is more convenient for me.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, midnight works for me as well. I might get a job in the future, so yeah, I might be working at this time.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, that's the issue for me is often I'm just working right now. Usually. So, and like, it can even be like 1 AM is fine. It's just like when it was 2 AM, that's a little bit pushing it for me. Yeah, 2:30, it's a little bit late, you know. But like 1 AM is fine, 12 o'clock is fine, 11 o'clock is fine. Like any— so that would be like 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock PST. Weekends, weekdays, it doesn't really matter.

**Speaker A:** All right. How about the US folks? Tyler, Kishon, Corey, Robert, what are your thoughts on the meeting at 3 PM West Coast time versus 8 AM West Coast time? Are both those conflicting with the workday or—.

**Speaker D:** That's fine. That's fine for me.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** That would be 4. It's better. 3 Pacific would be, uh, 4:05, uh, for Central Time. 5 PM, right?

**Speaker E:** 3 PM is probably better.

**Speaker B:** Is that convenient for you?

**Speaker C:** I work, um, 8 AM till 5 PM Monday to Friday, but I could always take off like 15 minutes for, uh Uh, West Coast. I'm on the West Coast, Washington.

**Speaker B:** What time zone?

**Speaker C:** GMT for the West Coast. I live in Washington State.

**Speaker B:** Okay, you're in Washington State. Okay, so 3 PM is not a good time for you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, he said that at most he'd be able to take 15 minutes off for the meeting.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker C:** Like if it's anywhere between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. on the West Coast, then I could do like a 15-minute meeting. If it's at 7:30 a.m., then I could do 30 minutes. So I think 7:30 a.m. on Mondays would be okay for me. That's pretty close to the suggested time.

**Speaker A:** And Robert Cohen, you're traveling a lot. Do you have any input, or is it just wherever you are it'll be different?

**Speaker F:** Both of those times are fine. You know, I'm pretty much fine with either one.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so it sounds like if we do a weekday— Yeah, go ahead.

**Speaker F:** Yeah, if I'm traveling, I'll just let you guys know if I call, but that should be fine either of those times. Preferably the— yeah, either one is fine actually.

**Speaker A:** So weekday at 3 PM Pacific time seems the most convenient to everyone. Are there any thoughts on weekends versus weekdays, or does Do weekdays seem the best? Anyone have anything to say about that?

**Speaker E:** Never have a formal conflict if it was on the weekend.

**Speaker D:** I would never have a formal conflict. I would have many informal conflicts most weekends.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I have full availability on the weekends.

**Speaker E:** Or flexible with the informal conflict, so.

**Speaker D:** You can— Yeah, I mean, I would probably be able to come to like 30% of meetings. If we did it on weekends.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, I would prefer weekends personally. It would be better to do that. I also think biweekly would be better too than doing it weekly, just because I think people might be able to commit to that more and might be able to rearrange their schedule no matter how it is if it's biweekly versus weekly. But that's just my guess and my feeling. For talking to people.

**Speaker B:** I agree with that. Yeah, I think we can do it all on biweekly.

**Speaker D:** I guess these are not necessarily the board meeting and this weekly meeting are different, are different things. We've been treating them as the same thing, but they would be different. And so the ones where we need like 3 on board, that's where we need the commitment from that, and we can make that work for everybody, whether that's weekend or weekday, and the weekly ones are like a different, a different animal.

**Speaker B:** Um, are we, are we making a distinction then between actual board meetings that are before the IRS and all of that versus everything else, or is it basically, um, all business in the board meeting and then the website is the second thing?

**Speaker D:** Well, the, the board meeting is just something that we like legally have to have And it's kind of more— Okay.

**Speaker B:** So everything else is going to be done. All right. Okay.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Well, what we could do then is some of the meetings that we have can then be called a board meeting.

**Speaker A:** Sure.

**Speaker D:** But the reason I'm bringing this up is because some of us, I think, are implicitly saying, well, I'm on the board, I have to be at the meeting. And what I'm saying is, well, actually, no, you don't. We only have to all as a board be at certain meetings. And these weekly meetings, we don't necessarily all need to be at. Okay, the distinction I was trying to make.

**Speaker B:** All right, so rather than having, say, 2 meetings in 1 week because of the board, what we can do is that we can have a biweekly meeting, and occasionally when it's necessary, 1 of those meetings will be the board meeting, an official board meeting.

**Speaker D:** Yes, we could do that, but my— the reason I'm making this distinction is that Like if you're on the board.

**Speaker B:** We'Ll let you know in advance so that we can plan it for you and make sure that we got the best attendance for those board meetings.

**Speaker D:** Sure, but I want to make something clear is that I think some people are having in the back of their mind, well, I'm on the board, I need to be at this meeting. And it's actually only some meetings you need to be at. And so if that could include combining them, like you said, or could actually mean—.

**Speaker B:** Meeting is already predefined rather than I can make this one but I can't make that one, and so we'll, uh, we'll make this one because the most people can make it back.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, well, I'm saying like it could be predefined or it could be something that we schedule a different meeting. So that's all the only point I'm trying to make is that it could be fine.

**Speaker B:** I was looking for the flexibility in it to make sure that it's as flexible as it can be so that the most people can get into it, and all we have to do is use Skype to make sure everybody knows.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, understood. So my second point there is that if we do weekends, that's fine. I will probably not be able to get most of them.

**Speaker B:** But like, we need you to be at the meetings because of the issue that much of the work that we're going to be doing has something to do with the website. Which is what you're going to be doing mostly in the work anyway.

**Speaker D:** I probably won't be working on the website very much personally, but I can give guidance there. But yeah, I will not be able to be at most weekend meetings.

**Speaker A:** All right, so it sounds like.

**Speaker B:** What.

**Speaker A:** We'Re working with now is two ideas. A weekday meeting at 3 PM and a weekend meeting. The weekend meeting is most convenient for the majority, but not convenient for Tyler. And then the weekday meeting at 3 PM is Some people can make it work, but it's inconvenient. But Tyler will be able to make it. So I guess what we're considering now is that what comes to mind is— yep, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** May I ask Tyler, which is more convenient for you, Saturdays or Sundays?

**Speaker D:** I guess Sundays if I had to pick one. But yeah, so I think you guys, you have to plan around me. Like if it's a board meeting, I can be there, but most— if you— it's just a normal weekday meeting, like, I, I won't be there most of the time.

**Speaker B:** Um, all right, okay, we can plan on that then if we can give you enough advance notice so that you can choose which weekend we're going to do the, um, the board meeting thing.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, yeah, that's, that's fine. Um, and so, like, for board meetings, we can figure that out separately. Uh, because if you— if I had to choose between Saturday and Sunday, Sunday would probably be, would probably be Okay.

**Speaker A:** Does Sunday at 3 PM Pacific work best?

**Speaker G:** Or would— Sunday is also, it's also good for— it's better for me on Sunday, so I think that's a good idea. And then I just wanted to say one point really quick is that like, I think sometimes like a lot of people are just like, I know I'm available on Skype just chatting and stuff, and I think sometimes informally if like we need to plan projects or something or things things come up, like, like, it can be that something gets planned, like, hey, let's talk, or, you know, or whatever. It doesn't have to be that this is the only time that we talk about what's going on, because, yeah, I mean, I'm available a lot to talk about this stuff. And it's— and if it's related to Dhamma, then, like, I'm down to, you know, work on it.

**Speaker D:** So, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yes, agreed.

**Speaker F:** Also, Sunday is quite bad for me. It is here in Latin America, it is the Universal Family Day, so it is family time here, so I can't really do Sundays.

**Speaker E:** I feel like we would want to have our chairman at most of these meetings, so maybe we do defer to having them on the weekday, even though you have a lot of conflicts with people doing it on the weekend. Or rather, be easier for a lot of people to do on the weekend, but you probably want your chairman at most of these meetings, is my thought.

**Speaker B:** Um, yeah, I thought you were saying that you couldn't make a 5 PM meeting on during the week. You can make a 5 PM meeting during the week, Keyshawn?

**Speaker E:** I can make, I can make, uh, the 5 PM Central Time meetings probably any, any week, on a Monday especially. You know, if there might be an occasion where an Anagami situation, which, or rather 10 AM, which is what we started at today for me, could potentially become a conflict if something comes up at work pressing. But otherwise, you know, so that would be less convenient. In either case, I should be able to make a good amount of the meetings.

**Speaker B:** Okay, Parker, one last point that I have, and that is that let's go ahead and figure out what we're going to do, knowing that at a later time we can change it, that we're not locked in.

**Speaker A:** Certainly, and especially considering that the intention is to be a Sangha and find even more and more people to join us in this venture. That this is really at most probably for the next few months, and then whenever, even if it is within a few months, we can change it. So it sounds like now that Mondays at 3 PM Pacific is the best to go with. So this time, but 7 hours, 8 hours later.

**Speaker B:** Okay, 2 PM. I thought you were talking about 3 PM.

**Speaker A:** Uh, 3 PM.

**Speaker B:** 2 PM, huh?

**Speaker A:** Let's see.

**Speaker B:** 3 PM. Yeah, you were saying 3 before, and you just said 2 one time, so I'm just making sure. 3 PM.

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker B:** Because that's— that's 5 o'clock. Uh, Central.

**Speaker A:** Yep. And, uh, Kishon will probably be off work at that point.

**Speaker B:** And I think that that would be like 6 PM for you, Robert, because you're in Columbia, and I think that Columbia is in the same as Eastern Standard, uh, Eastern time.

**Speaker F:** Oh, it's actually the same as Kishon, so I'm 2 hours ahead of Pacific.

**Speaker B:** Oh wow, I didn't realize that Brazil was that fat. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. All right, so we have that.

**Speaker B:** Central time. All right, okay, got it.

**Speaker G:** I mean, I know Dhammarato said he doesn't care about the time, but just to mention, it is 5— it's 5 AM in Thailand, just so that you know.

**Speaker B:** That's okay. Because Tam goes to work at 6 about half the month, so that's not a problem. And me sleeping in and missing the meeting, not a problem.

**Speaker A:** Great. So the last formal thing was just making room for informal discussion about business plans and.

**Speaker B:** Maybe we take a vote on that. Did we take a vote on the time?

**Speaker A:** No, we didn't. We can if we think— yeah, we can take a vote.

**Speaker B:** Not being formal or anything, just to.

**Speaker A:** Show who it works for. So, all in favor of a 3 PM PST meeting time? Weekly or biweekly? I guess we didn't hammer that out.

**Speaker B:** Biweekly. Yeah, we hammered that out.

**Speaker A:** Biweekly. Okay.

**Speaker B:** All right. Yeah, biweekly.

**Speaker A:** Sounds good.

**Speaker B:** So that's unanimous. All right.

**Speaker A:** Great. Cool. So I guess I can update on what's been going on. Tyler and I— Tyler did some great research on the bylaws. So bylaws are another IRS requirement, sort of like we're talking about with community meetings or these more aligning with everyone meetings versus the board of director meetings. We had the proposal process. And the project process and the task process that we had those Google Docs that we are creating, and that's what we are liking for maintaining the organization at this moment. But IRS, the IRS also needs some rules written down in a paper called the bylaws, and we all need to commit to following these rules and be held to them legally. So we've been doing research on What is the bare minimum for these rules?

**Speaker B:** That's the question, is the fewer the better. Okay, I vote first off to have a unisex bathroom.

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly the point, that we want to find the most stripped-down version so we can improvise and create structure as necessary and not have a lot of unnecessary structure that we're bound to. So that's what's been going on with the organization stuff recently.

**Speaker D:** I can give a little more detail there too.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that'd be great, Tyler.

**Speaker D:** The bylaws are very important in that they are legally consequential, in that if we didn't follow the bylaws, Open Sangha could be like legally liable for that. Board members can be personally liable, potentially even, for not following the bylaws if anything, you know, God forbid anything were to happen. And so it is something to like really take seriously, and that's why we're spending a lot of time into like making sure that they actually make sense for what we're doing. And so like once we are at the stage we're ready to pass them, like for all the board members, we really do have to review them like very seriously and like make sure we understand them because we are going to be bound by doing certain things, especially some of these meetings, how we record information. It's not just like a piece of paper, it is something we have to do. So we're keeping them really stripped down, and I think what this also did is it really clarified what the board does and like what the board makes decisions on. What the board makes decisions on, a lot of it is largely about like things that are like legal or financial or like very big, like strategic directions. But otherwise we wanna keep the organization pretty lightweight where people can, if they have an idea, they wanna do something, they wanna write a blog post or they wanna like spin up a new project and they're willing to do that work, like, you know, go for it as long as it's within the mission.

**Speaker A:** Right?

**Speaker D:** And so the next thing that we're gonna be, I'm spending a lot of time on is thinking through a structure that like, If you have an idea and you just want to do it, that you can kind of like, your hands will be unbound and you could just like go for it. And without having to go through like a proposal process, right? Because the proposals are good for like certain things, like big decisions for the board. But if you want to like do a fun project, like you shouldn't have to do that. And so we're kind of like creating a structure so we can like kind of make sure we understand everything that's going on and keep track of things. So stay tuned for that.

**Speaker B:** For that. What are the kind of requirements that are made by the IRS? Are there any bylaws that they actually require?

**Speaker D:** I think a lot of it is— I'm not sure if they're necessarily legally required in that, like, hey, to be a tax-exempt organization you need these X, Y, and Z. But I think there's things they review each 501(c)(3) application, and there's certain things that traditionally you kind of like just need to have to get approved. So a few of those things are board roles like president, secretary, treasurer are the big ones. You need to have like at least like one annual meeting where you take meeting notes, right? And like those are— and then you have to have like a way to like change your bylaws over time, and you have to have like voting members and non-voting members. So that's kind of like the basics of it. There's like a bunch of details within it, but that's kind of like the meat of it.

**Speaker B:** Oh, do you have something already printed out as an example?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, so actually, Parker, we got that— somebody from Fiverr who helped us put together our bylaws, and so we actually.

**Speaker B:** Already have— oh, okay. Why don't we do it this way? Why don't you guys go ahead and print that out or publish it on our Skype site here for all to read, and we can vote on it the next meeting.

**Speaker D:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Or I'm going to fly blind and vote on it with a yes without reading it.

**Speaker D:** So it's actually already in our open Sangha Foundation shared drive, and so Parker posted that a couple weeks ago. We post another link for that shortly. Yesterday I did like a deep dive where I reviewed all the bylaws and I had some open questions. There's a couple things I think Parker and I need to discuss, but I think we're getting close to being ready to pass it. And so I think what we'll do this during the next meeting is we'll actually pass the bylaws. Does that sound good for everyone?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it sounds good. I guess the other project— we had working was the website project, and I think where we're at with that is there was discussion about the newsletter, what data we'd like to connect with it, collect with the newsletter, and getting that figured out. But if you go to the opensanghafoundation.org URL. The website is up. Anlu made a wonderful website, and the Skype hyperlink is there, so people from the website— I just clicked on the website link and it went right to the Skype call, and same with the YouTube. And I think we're just figuring out now how we're collecting data at this initial starting point. So does anyone have any thoughts on that or anything else? If not, I think the next plan of action would be for me and Tyler to continue talking about the bylaws and then have something prepared to be voted on 2 weeks from today.

**Speaker D:** Sweet. I have one more thing to talk about.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that'd be great.

**Speaker D:** If you want to stay on for another minute, a couple minutes. It's about our communication tools, and I personally don't love Skype, and I find Discord to be a lot more powerful tool in certain ways. It's just a lot easier to keep track of conversations, and also it has all the same like voice and video functionality that Skype does, but with way more functionality on top of it. So I would personally like if we could move from Skype to Discord. I'm kind of curious what you guys think about that.

**Speaker B:** I prefer Skype. I have been on Discord And it's— for one thing, it's too much like Reddit, uh, and that's what it looks like to be, to where Skype seems to be a completely different thing that's actually quite geared for these groups and things and, and whatnot. And I, I'm on Skype every day. I'm on Discord— I don't even remember the last time I was on Discord.

**Speaker D:** Well, maybe, maybe I can give like a little bit more color to that. I think the hardest thing about Skype is it's not really geared towards like group or team collaboration. Like, it's really good at like one-on-one video calls, but it's really bad at.

**Speaker B:** Like— Would it be part of the Dharma dudes, or would it be a completely separate Discord?

**Speaker D:** Probably, probably a separate one since we're trying to keep those groups distinct.

**Speaker F:** I think there are certain parts of Discord that would be really perfect for this. Like, for example, it's difficult for me to search all the previous proposals. I was talking with Dhammarato about one of them the other day, and it was hard for me to find it in Skype. But you can just do it like a pinned, you know, thread on Discord where you have all the, you know, documents pertaining to the OSF. It could be really easily searchable. So I think stuff like that could be great for Discord, maybe just text communication, but I think we should probably continue to have our video chats via Skype just because it's easiest for everyone. I don't know, that's just my suggestion.

**Speaker D:** I think the video is actually even easier on Discord the way that they set it up. I think they have— or like, it's like very similar to how they do it on Skype.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there wouldn't be any. The only additional complication would be recording the videos on Discord. On Skype, there's a cloud recording. On Discord, it's not much of a hassle, but someone would have to have screen recording software like OBS installed to record the meetings.

**Speaker B:** And oh, well, that should be a death blow then to Discord if it doesn't allow recording.

**Speaker D:** No, I think it will, but it's just like slightly harder. I think you can do all the things you can do in Skype and Discord. There might be a couple things that might be slightly harder, but then Discord you get lots more functionality and it's a lot easier to collaborate than in Skype.

**Speaker B:** Well, one of the things then that we have to set up is to make sure that like on Skype, whoever opens the call is the one then that has to do the, uh, the invitations, and by nature also to start the video call. So that would be one of the requirements of whoever starts the call would have to start to— would be the one responsible for the video. Yeah, so that means.

**Speaker G:** I think I kind of agree with Robert Cohen that like maybe since we've just— I know that it's like maybe better in some ways for the video, but because we've been doing it on Skype, that it's not that different really doing it on Skype or doing it on Discord in my mind. But the chatting is definitely way, way better. Like, I can't stand chatting on Skype because I can't find anything and I can't— there's not any separate categories. And like, say that somebody wants to have a separate project, you can easily be like, I'm moderator and I just make a new tab and the people can go in and chat about whatever project it is within that. And it's way easier to keep track of. So at least for like the, yeah, the typing part of it, I think Discord is better, but I don't think it makes a difference for the video really.

**Speaker D:** I think it does. Well, I think it does in one sense in that if we, I don't think, I think you have to choose one. If you want chat to work, because the problem with doing both is that if you're doing video on Skype, people will continue using the chat on Skype as well, and now all of your chats are fragmented between Discord and Skype. And so I personally wouldn't want to.

**Speaker B:** Do— well, that's why I like Skype, because then I can see all of it, because I probably won't even be remembering about the Discord.

**Speaker D:** Well, so I'll continue to do Skype. So another thing you could potentially do is you could move everything over. You can fully move over your Skype chats into the Dhamma dudes chat as well and Discord. And so that's another possibility too, is that you can fully migrate to Discord rather than being fragmented between them.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, so how I see it, I agree with what's been said that the text chat on Discord is a whole lot more convenient than on Skype. It takes a little getting used to for the people moving over to Skype because the tabs are different and there are different nuances in how the situation works, but once people get used to it, it'll allow for much more efficient communication. And the complications are coming up, which video call is better? I'd agree with Joe's statement that Skype is more convenient because they can be recorded by anyone. They don't need to have a software installed. So if we go that route, doing Discord and Skype, we'd need to be, to Skylar's point, really strict about keeping all the text chat in Discord. And if people are talking Skype, to do like what Dhammarato does really well, if it's off topic, say, hey, go to this chat. That we don't talk about stuff here, this is just for video calls, go to the Discord, and then link them to the Discord. I don't think this is going to.

**Speaker D:** Be much, much, much easier if we fully migrate and deprecate Skype, like completely. Like this.

**Speaker B:** Is— I actually wouldn't want.

**Speaker D:** To do this at all. If we didn't fully move to Discord, I wouldn't want to mess with Discord at all because I think it would be a mess.

**Speaker G:** So to answer Keyshawn really quick, the thing that's more convenient about the text chatting on Discord is that you can actually search there and you can easily make new tabs. That's like, okay, we have this project that somebody is working on. They can have a separate tab that is within the chat and then it can, and you can pin things also. So there's just like, it's small things, but it makes like a huge difference for being able to like find stuff.

**Speaker A:** I think the main thing is separate channels.

**Speaker B:** I think I got the point. Yes, right. Here's why I like Skype is because it's people-oriented. Somebody says something and I can go down and hear what they have to say, to where Discord is much more just a bunch of text, just a bunch of text just scrolling by, and I don't know who did what and all of that kind kind of stuff. So I basically, uh, have been ignoring Discord for months because everything that I do works with— but I tell you what, if, if Discord is better for you guys, then go ahead and use it and don't worry about me. Well, I guess in the sense that if you address me on Discord, you're not going to get an answer.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, well, the reason why I bring this up is not splitting, is that I think Even the Sangha chat that happens in Skype, if that was combined with Dhamma Dudes, like that all happened in Dhamma Dudes, I'd be much more likely to engage in the Dhamma Dudes Discord. But since they're fragmented between the two, I kind of like, I don't want to spread my attention to both places. I don't look at both places.

**Speaker B:** That's exactly why I don't want to go to Discord. That's exactly the reason. I do not want to move to Discord, but if you guys want to move Discord, go right ahead. Yeah, but don't expect me to go and, you know— Yeah, what is it.

**Speaker E:** About Discord that is, uh, more text-oriented versus Skype being people-oriented exactly? Is it the, uh, the profile pictures?

**Speaker B:** I don't, I don't know how to use it. It doesn't look like it's of any value to me.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, there's a lot of things that actually are like much, much better than the way Skype does it. So for example, even having a thread of a conversation and saying like, hey, I'm replying to this, like someone asked a question 10 posts ago and say, I'm replying to this post that someone asked, you know, 10 posts ago, which is like a very simple thing, but you can't actually do that in Skype in the same way. I guess you can, but I do.

**Speaker B:** It, I do it, I do it.

**Speaker D:** In exactly the same way. You could thread it a little bit easier in Discord. There's other things like even having channels for certain topics, like, and having those channels public. Like when somebody joins and wants to join governance, they can't just see that there's a governance channel. Someone has to know to add them manually. Or even adding things like wikis. You can add wikis in Discord of like, hey, here are all the things you need to know. Here are like the links you should be looking at, and here's like frequently asked questions about our community. Like, that's really easy to do with Discord. You can have bots that will prompt people to introduce themselves in a certain way, right? Like, you can do interesting things that make it easier to build a community than in Skype.

**Speaker B:** Tyler, guess what? The longer you talk, the less convinced I am. The more you say about it's got this feature and it's got that feature and this, that, and the other thing, is exactly why I don't want to use it. But like I said before, please hear me without going any further. It's okay with me that you guys move to Discord. Just don't address me expecting me to give an answer. But if you want to address me, address me.

**Speaker D:** The reason you aren't relevant in this is that— or you are relevant— is.

**Speaker B:** That that's exactly right. I'm not relevant in any cases.

**Speaker D:** You are relevant for this, and why I want your opinion on this is that for this to work, you actually have to shut down all of the Open Sangha Foundation channels in Skype. So basically, if we were willing to shut all— every— all Open Sangha— no.

**Speaker B:** We ain't going to— we're not going to shut down anything in Skype. Well, you can add more Discord if you want to use Discord.

**Speaker D:** Well, I don't know, I think this is a group discussion that we need to have, right? Like, we we would have to actually shut that down. I would not— we should not move to Discord at all if we're not going to shut these down. And so there's a better communication tool available to us for that to work. We cannot have our communication fragmented. If we don't want to move to Discord, that's fine, we'll stay on Skype. But like, we should do one or the other.

**Speaker A:** What's the specific critiques you have with Discord, Dhammarato?

**Speaker B:** Is it— Number one, okay, now right first off, you have to understand I'm a really, really old man. That's the number 1, which meant that in the old, old, uh, text screens, they were black with white letters. And now I go to Discord and it's a black screen and I can't read it, for one thing.

**Speaker G:** You can change— you can change that.

**Speaker B:** I know you can, but I can't. I know you can change it, but I can't because I don't know how and I don't know where to look. I guess where What I'm actually saying is, if you can get somebody on Skype with me to walk me through Discord so I could set the thing up so that I can actually use it, then I might.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but the way to call you on your own time, I'm not going to play around with it.

**Speaker B:** I just want to use it the way that it is. That's what I'm saying, guys. Go ahead and do your whole thing on Discord, but don't address me. If you want to talk to me, address me on Skype.

**Speaker D:** Okay, that makes sense. So maybe if we did this, we can kind of start experimenting with it before we like officially roll it out. We could just maybe get a Discord going, see how that feels. And then, uh, Dhammarato, we could do like a one-on-one session with you and just kind of like make it like so it's optimized for your setup and what you need.

**Speaker B:** Um, and then yeah, first off, the first thing that I'll need is for the screen character size in— well, maybe we can do that with the webpage, that I can change that particular webpage to be a larger font so that I can see it.

**Speaker D:** Totally, yeah, and I can help you.

**Speaker B:** We've got to change it to white on black, I mean, white background, because the black background, I can't read anything that's there. Okay, the next thing is, is that, uh, we need to have it away from Dhamma Dews because Dhamma Dews is just full of all kinds of people saying all kinds of things. And that it's not only that, but you've got a general and you've got a this and that and the other thing, and nobody's paying attention to what they're posting, and they just post any place. And so nobody's paying any attention to those, uh, categories stories anyway. Yeah, that's— and so I can't go look for who said what, but I can do all of that in Skype, you see. I can look for what— who says what in Skype.

**Speaker D:** So, so maybe what we'll do is we'll— we can do like a little test run. We won't fully roll it out, and then, uh, Dhammarato will do some one-on-one sessions with you, get you acquainted with it. And then if at a certain point you're like, hey, this actually feels pretty good If you were to feel that way, maybe we would think about getting rid of these old Open Sangha Foundation chats in Skype, but that's at a later discussion.

**Speaker B:** Why get rid of them? That's the whole point, is I don't understand why you want to get rid of them. If you just start using the Discord, then you're using Discord. I don't see any reason for you to kill the firstborn babe just so you can have a second baby. It doesn't make any any sense. I vote directly against you taking anything off of Skype.

**Speaker G:** I think, I think you should just keep it because like, okay, it's— is it really that inconvenient to check in a couple of places? Like, I don't know, I'm logged on, I'm logged on to like Telegram and Skype and like Discord. Like, I'm just used— I'm just— but I'm used to just checking everything. Like, you know, but you know what's most convenient would be like if all of you were like sitting right next to me and we were just like living together. That would be the most convenient. So we already have one level of inconvenience of like the internet, but like, I don't see it's that big of a deal. I mean, you know, if people want to talk in Skype, like they can talk in Skype. I agree with Dhammarato that you should just keep it open.

**Speaker A:** And yeah, I think that whether or not it's open or not is not really significant. I think that'll come just by nature of what— whose people— who's using what. And at some point, if everyone moves to Discord and everyone's on Discord, and the Skype channels may still exist, they may not. That's not really of relevance. What we're really looking for is what's used.

**Speaker B:** Who's going to take care of making sure that people do move over to Discord? Well, that's just more work to do. I don't understand why you guys want to make extra work. We've already got the system working right now. It works Just fine.

**Speaker D:** I'm saying the work is actually very, very easy.

**Speaker E:** Let it rot.

**Speaker D:** So it's actually extremely easy to move people over. All we have to do is shut down these channels and show each other.

**Speaker B:** We spend 20 minutes talking about how difficult it is to move over there.

**Speaker D:** No, no, it's very, very simple if you shut down these channels. Extremely simple. It'll take me 5 minutes to get everyone on the Discord.

**Speaker B:** Okay. I did everything that you're saying now except, uh, taking down these channels. That doesn't make any sense to me. Okay, um, okay, makes no sense at all for us to harm Skype so you can use Discord. If you want to use Discord, go ahead.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, it— the— and the crux— I won't say any more about it. The crux of it is that you— we are much likely to have a successful communication channel if we're spread between multiple ones. And so you either commit to one or you don't do both. I'm not willing to use Discord if we're not willing to like have an idea that we might want to fully transition at some point, because I think it actually makes our lives much, much harder by being spread between multiple communication channels.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, here's a possibility. Let's use Skype until you don't need me anymore, and then you guys can go do whatever you want to do.

**Speaker G:** I think just like one point is that there are people who are like not on Discord too, that like we are all young men that use Discord, but like there are legitimately people that I chat with on Skype that I'm not sure they even know what Discord is.

**Speaker D:** And I didn't have a Skype account when I first started joining this community either. So like most— there are a lot of people who didn't have a Skype account who had to get one to join this.

**Speaker G:** It's kind of— I mean, everybody, like, all my friends have Skype. Like, I don't know, but I'm old, so I don't know.

**Speaker F:** I sense lots of craving and attachment in this conversation.

**Speaker B:** I know, and I'm trying to tell them, go ahead and do what you want to do. You don't need me. I'm curious about— I'm saying, if you want to move to Discord, go ahead. I'm not really all that sure that I can use Discord, but if somebody can help me walk through it and I get up to it, then I might do it. But the one thing that I am saying is don't address me on Discord expecting me to ever answer.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, I think that's a very fair point.

**Speaker E:** I don't think that there'll be any material impact to moving from, uh, you know, any benefit or any, you know, material impact if we were to move to Discord, it'd be just about the same. I mean, you could talk just as much, you could share files just as much. In fact, we should stop sharing files on Skype anyways. We should be sharing files on like Google Drive or something like that. I mean, it's not really like a file sharing service, but, you know, I think we should just stay on Skype and keep it simple. I am curious though, what about Discord could you possibly change to make it more people-oriented than Reddit-oriented? If we were to go that route. I feel like if you were to do that, then maybe it would make— it would at least take away some of the pain from switching over.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I mean, I guess the tool is just built for collaboration where like this— Skype isn't built for collab— team collaboration. It's built for one-on-one video calls and like kind of like bigger group things, not like getting things done as an organization.

**Speaker E:** And Discord and Slack— what organizations use Discord?

**Speaker D:** Oh, it's extremely popular for most new organizations that start up.

**Speaker E:** They, uh, I've never been in an organization that uses Discord.

**Speaker D:** We've always used Teams or like super, super common like in the video game community, crypto news startups, like basically new nonprofits. Almost all of them use, uh, Discord.

**Speaker E:** All the professional organizations I've ever been a part of.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, professional organizations.

**Speaker B:** Interesting you're talking about that because I've, uh, from everything that I've heard that you're saying about Discord, I've heard being used with Zoom, but I don't know of anybody that's using Discord much. Uh, schools and, you know, universities, all kinds of places are using Zoom, and that is senior generally not a good product for the way that we're doing things, because you have to use emails to tell people when the Zoom calls are happening and get them to click on a bunch of stuff. So it's— Zoom is way out of line for the kind of stuff that we're wanting to do.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, I'm not going to say anything more about this, but as someone who's been trying to collaborate with lots of people in this organization to get things done. I have found Skype to be painful to get things done as an organization, and I really do not like using it. I think it's going to hold us back as an organization. That's why I was recommending we use at the very least Slack, Slack or Discord, something that's actually built for team collaboration. If people don't want to do that, that's fine. But like, I just wanted to voice that because I think this is a— Skype is a very bad tool for team collaboration. It's a great tool for one-on-one video collaboration. Great.

**Speaker A:** I think where we can start with this, I think the main thing is that Dhammarato, like you said, you're getting old, you've been using this Skype for 7 years, why switch now?

**Speaker B:** And no, since about 2002 I've been using Skype.

**Speaker A:** So 20 years, and so this is what you're used to. The one-to-one interaction is different than the more organization community-based interaction. People on Discord often identify themselves with anonymous names, where Skype people use their full name. One-on-one calls are easier on Skype. So maybe I think where we go with this next is we can continue with Skype right now and But me and Tyler, if you're interested, can call Dhammarato at some point and maybe introduce you to the Dhamma Friends, Dhamma Dudes Discord and get your software set up so it's accessible and it doesn't just like look like a bunch of text and maybe familiarize you. And then maybe once there's familiarity, we can make a more informed decision.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's like to find something that's interesting, you have to go page after page after page after page after page in Discord. I have to do that sometimes in Skype, but at least we know which place to go looking. We're in Discord, gosh, you have to just scroll and scroll.

**Speaker A:** And part of it is the familiarity with the platform that you have with Skype, using it for 20 years. But a lot of us with Discord, we've grown up with it, using it to chat with our friends. I mean, in high school, all my friends for the whole grade had a Discord chat that they used. So it's the software that my generation, the younger generation, uses to collaborate. And like Tyler says, a lot of new organizations now are starting to use Discord, although big organizations like Kishon is talking about, corporate organizations tend to use things like Slack, Microsoft Teams for their collaboration. Discord is a platform that's becoming used a lot. It's free and community-based, so I think it would be worthwhile having a bit of a discussion, try it out with you, and then we can talk from there. From there, it's just speculation because right right now, um, you're not familiar with the platform as much as, uh, you might be able to be, right?

**Speaker B:** That's what I'm saying. You guys do what you want to do with Discord. I don't care. Yeah, the only request that I'm making is don't address me directly because I will not answer on it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, because you've been using Skype for 20 years and.

**Speaker B:** Uh, Discord, you just.

**Speaker A:** Don'T know what's going on. Exactly.

**Speaker D:** Dhammarato, I hear all your concerns of why you don't like using, you're nervous about Discord. Totally makes sense. What I was trying to figure out is a way that we can all experiment on it together. And if I can get you engaged on Discord in some way, because it'd be awesome to have the community all in one place. It'd be awesome if you— It's okay.

**Speaker B:** You don't have to keep talking and convincing and convincing already. Yeah, go ahead and set it up. Okay, if you want.

**Speaker A:** To. Okay, great. So what we'll follow up with in 2 weeks is the— Tyler and I will work on the bylaws and get something together that can be read and agreed upon in the next meeting. If there are any complications with that, we'll let you guys know. And yeah, and then on the meeting topic, the meeting will be 2 weeks from now, a little later in the day, midnight EU time and 3 PM Pacific time. And we have our board of directors— officers chosen, so the IRS will be happy. The board chair is Tyler, the vice chair is Corey, the secretary is Robert Cohen, and the treasurer is Joe. And on the Discord topic, I think we should just carry it forward with experimentation, just like a new toy to play with. And maybe some of us give Dhammarato a call and we can play around with it a little bit, see if it's any fun and see if it's useful. And if not, we're working at least somewhat on Skype, so we can continue with that for now. If someone wants to play around with setting a Discord up, we can do it, but I think Dhammarato is really crucial to the organization, and it would need to be something he's able to participate in in a fairly frictionless, seamless way. So.

**Speaker B:** If any— so long as you don't address me on Skype, because I mean, uh, you see, I have at least the possibility that when somebody calls, I can hear them ring. That I can do. When they text me, it may be many hours if I go through Skype, because I use Skype. But now you're asking me to directly to go to Discord just because there might be something there, and I'm not sure that that's going to happen on a regular basis.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and I understand that.

**Speaker B:** Does it notify? Does it— it's, uh, an example of that would be every time that we— you have something on Discord, it sends me an email saying that there is something on Discord. That might be useful.

**Speaker A:** We'll, uh, get that worked out because I know at your house you have, uh, maybe a lot of infrastructure, or you have computers in different parts of the house with Skype, one computer hooked up to a speaker notifying you when someone calls on Skype. So I think we can just play around with it, see if it works on Discord, because there are certain features that are beneficial. And not just, oh, this is a shiny new feature that if we're looking to go further as an organization and invite people from other communities I think at some point it'll have a really useful benefit.

**Speaker B:** Here's one of the points that we can talk about then, and that is on the Discord, you're expecting to only have scheduled calls, is that correct? No, only scheduled calls.

**Speaker D:** No, it's not just scheduled. You do scheduled or you can do unscheduled, and you can have notifications for each.

**Speaker B:** Okay, if it's an unscheduled call, please understand that I will not be on it if I have advance notice about the scheduled calls, but I don't see any way that an unscheduled call is going to get my attention.

**Speaker D:** Yes, I think we're on the same page. I think, yeah, Dhammarato, our next goal is we're going to kind of, kind of figure out, okay, what would be useful with Discord? Can we set up in such a way that it could actually be useful to you and it wouldn't be stressful for you to use? And if we can't solve those two problems, we're not going to use it.

**Speaker B:** Oh, it's not going to be stressful because I won't use it.

**Speaker D:** We were going to figure out, is there a way that you could potentially use it that would not impact you at all, that would basically feel very easy for you? If we can't figure that out, we won't use it.

**Speaker A:** Exactly, exactly. We want the experience to be similar to what it is on Skype right now, and if that's not the case, then we wouldn't want to use it.

**Speaker B:** Right. Here's an example of that. The only version that I have of it is on the website. Does it have an additional download, an application that it has of its own, or is it merely web-based?

**Speaker A:** It's both, but the application is what most people use.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I don't have that application.

**Speaker A:** Okay, yes, so I think it'd be beneficial to talk with you and see how to download the application and see if it can be set up like Skype. Cool. All right, well, I think we made some good progress in this discussion, a bunch of different fronts, if that's what we're trying to make. All right, anyone else have anything to say? If not, Tyler and I will continue talking about the bylaws. Me and if others want to help Dhammarato set up Skype, we'll do that. And yeah, well, all right, great seeing you all. Good seeing you, Joe, Robert, Keishon, Corey, Robert Cohen, Tyler. I'm so glad. I wasn't sure how many people would show up, but I'm glad we had such a good turnout. All right, good seeing you all.

**Speaker B:** I agree. Thanks.

**Speaker A:** Great seeing you guys. You see, ciao.

**Speaker B:** Thank you. We'll see you guys.

**Speaker A:** Have a good one.

**Speaker B:** Give me a call, Robert. You got travel friends.

**Speaker F:** Take care, everyone.

**Speaker B:** Cheers.

**Speaker A:** Will do.


### Summary

Based on the transcript, this is not a Dhamma talk (a teaching on Buddhist principles). It is a **business and organizational meeting** for the **Open Sangha Foundation (OSF)**, a group that appears to be a Buddhist-inspired nonprofit.

Here is a summary of the meeting's key agenda items and outcomes:

### 1. **Board of Directors Election**
The primary goal was to fill four official officer roles required for their 501(c)(3) nonprofit status.
*   **Board Chair:** Tyler (volunteered and approved)
*   **Vice Chair:** Corey (volunteered and approved)
*   **Secretary:** Robert Cohen (volunteered and approved). It was clarified that the secretary's main duty is for official, less-frequent board meetings, not necessarily all weekly community calls. Note-taking for general meetings can be shared.
*   **Treasurer:** Joe (volunteered and approved)
The slate was voted on and approved by the group.

### 2. **Meeting Time & Schedule**
The group debated the best regular time for their "whole community" meetings, considering global time zones.
*   **Decision:** They voted to meet **biweekly (every two weeks) on Mondays at 3:00 PM PST**.
*   **Reasoning:** This time was a compromise. While weekends were better for some, the elected Board Chair (Tyler) and others found weekdays more reliable. They distinguished between mandatory *board meetings* (infrequent) and general *community meetings* (biweekly).

### 3. **Organizational Updates**
*   **Bylaws:** Tyler and Parker are finalizing the organization's bylaws (the legal rules required by the IRS). They emphasized keeping them minimal and flexible. The finalized bylaws will be reviewed and voted on at the next meeting.
*   **Website:** The website (opensanghafoundation.org) is live and functional.

### 4. **Discussion on Communication Tools (Skype vs. Discord)**
A lengthy debate ensued about potentially moving the group's primary communication from Skype to Discord.
*   **Pro-Discord (Tyler, Joe, others):** Argued Discord is better for team collaboration, with features like organized channels, searchability, threads, and wikis. They felt Skype is cumbersome for project management.
*   **Pro-Skype (Dhammarato, others):** Dhammarato, as a long-time user, found Skype more personable and straightforward. He expressed difficulty with Discord's interface and was resistant to fracturing communication across two platforms.
*   **Outcome:** No decision was made. The group agreed to **experiment with Discord**. Tyler and others will help Dhammarato set it up comfortably. The future of the Skype groups will depend on whether a seamless transition for all, especially Dhammarato, can be achieved.

### Key Takeaway:
This was a **practical organizational meeting** focused on establishing the nonprofit's legal structure, scheduling, and operational tools. The content was administrative, not doctrinal. The presence of someone named Dhammarato suggests the group is connected to a Buddhist teacher, but the talk itself was purely about building the foundation's infrastructure.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use a few metaphors and stories to illustrate points or add humor:

**Metaphors:**

1.  **"Getting the ball rolling"** — Used by Speaker A to describe initiating discussion about the business plan and practicalities.
2.  **"Third man out"** — Used by Speaker B (Dhammarato) to suggest prioritizing convenience for the UK and US, and accepting that the Asian time zone participant (himself) would be the one for whom the time is least convenient.
3.  **"A different animal"** — Used by Speaker D (Tyler) to distinguish between official board meetings and more informal community meetings.
4.  **"Death blow"** — Used by Speaker B to humorously suggest that if Discord doesn't allow easy recording, that single drawback should decisively end the discussion about switching to it.
5.  **"Kill the firstborn babe just so you can have a second baby"** — Used by Speaker B as a vivid metaphor arguing against shutting down the existing Skype channels just to migrate to Discord. He sees it as an unnecessary destruction of something that works.
6.  **"Let it rot"** — A brief, metaphorical suggestion by Speaker E (Keyshawn) regarding the Skype chat if they move to Discord, implying they could just abandon it without actively shutting it down.

**Stories / Jokes:**

1.  **The Chocolate Role Joke:** Speaker B makes a pun, volunteering for the "chocolate role." This is a play on words, joking about the official *roles* (like Secretary) by substituting a delicious *roll* (a pastry). Speaker C continues the joke by suggesting the title "Wonketeer" (a play on "Wonka" from *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory*).
2.  **The Archaic Secretary:** Speaker B tells a brief, humorous story to downplay the importance of the Secretary role: *"it's ancient. It's archaic... back in the Middle Ages, we've got videos now... that makes the secretary's job just dead easy."* He paints a picture of a bygone era with fountain pens to contrast with modern technology.
3.  **The Telegram Quip:** When Speaker A says, "It's right before I quit," Speaker D interjects with, "Got a telegram from her the day." This is a quick, witty line that constructs a mini-narrative, humorously imagining an old-fashioned resignation via telegram to match the previous "archaic" theme.

**Overall Observation:** The metaphors and stories are used primarily to clarify organizational concepts (like differentiating meeting types), to argue a point vividly (especially in the Discord vs. Skype debate), and to inject levity into the procedural discussion. Speaker B (Dhammarato) is the most frequent user of these rhetorical devices.
