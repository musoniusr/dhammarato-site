### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, hello everyone, welcome to the weekly UK Sangha. I host these talks every Wednesday, 12 PM PST. You can come and ask questions, you can come and meditate, listen along, but anyone's welcome. And today I have a sutta prepared. But before I read the sutta, something I was mentioning is when we stop and we meditate formally, so when we meditate sitting down, you can close your eyes, but you don't have to close your eyes. Maybe you just like look down. But the important thing is you're not focusing on anything in particular in your field of vision. You're just letting all of your vision wash in without focusing in on, so without like scanning the room or looking anywhere else. You could just be looking straight ahead and not focus on anything and just kind of let the whole spectrum of your field of vision come in. That's equally meditative as closing your eyes. So there's no like better way that you need to close your eyes. You don't need to close your eyes. But anyways, when you formally meditate, this gives us an opportunity. This gives us a chance to see what the mind does habitually. Because when you stop doing anything, and the kinds of thoughts that come up when you stop doing anything, those thoughts aren't based on any new input, for example. So it's not based on anything you're interacting with the world, because you're kind of just stopping interacting with the world, right? So those thoughts are completely based on internal tendencies So it's important to recognize what is the habit of my mind. So when I stop and I meditate, does all kinds of worries and doubts come up and all kinds of anxieties and fears and unwholesome thoughts come up? And if they do, then that's good, because now we can find the culprit that's causing you suffering in the rest of your life. When you're doing stuff, right? So the tendencies of your mind that causes you suffering when you sit down and do nothing is the tendencies of mind that we can see more clearly when we're not interacting with the world. So when we're just sitting and meditating, and it's important to recognize what what the mind is doing and to recognize whether in fact it is either wholesome or unwholesome. Because this is going to be the determining factor for the right effort that you take to come out of the unwholesome into the wholesome for the sake of bringing an end to your psychological suffering. And psychological pain. Um, so it's, it's nothing like personal really. It's not like, oh, I have a— my mind is like shitty and I have like shitty habits. No, it's just what the causes of your conditions up to this point have led up to has created this reaction mechanism that's been installed in your brain that you have the power with clear comprehension and, uh, and wisdom and paying attention, waking up to the habits of your mind, you have the power to actually change that for your own good and for the good of everyone. So that's essentially the purpose of meditation. And that's the purpose of the Dhamma. If people teach anything else other than that, then they're missing the point. And that's a perfect segue into the sutta. A couple, I think it was a while back, I think maybe 4 or 5 months ago, I had a talk with Dhammarato asking him what are the most important suttas, and this was one of them. And this one's interesting to me because it's not from the Middle Length Discourses. So it's not from the Majjhima Nikaya, which is where I read most of the suttas from. Like that's the bulk of the suttas that I've read. I've read from the Samyutta Nikaya, of course, but this one's from the Anguttara Nikaya, the Book of Threes. Okay, so it's one of the collections or bodies of discourses that the Buddha gave. And so I posted the link in the chat. Maybe I should post it like a couple days in advance so people can read it before I bring it up. But maybe next week. But for those of you watching the video, this is the Anguttara Nikaya 3.65. And I'm reading the Bhikkhu Bodhi translation, just because I've gotten used to the way that Bodhi translates certain recurring phrases in the Dhamma. So for the sake of consistency, I always read the Bodhi translation if there is one, because he translates the same terms the same way every time, and the same terms keep coming up. Okay, let's get into it. Alrighty, let me bring up the tab. All right. On one occasion, the Blessed One was wandering on tour among the Kasalans together with a large Sangha of monks. When he reached the town of the Kasalamas named Kesuputta, the Kalamas of Kesuputta heard, it is said, that the ascetic Gotama, the son of the Sakyans, who went forth from a Sakyan family, has arrived at Kesaputta. Now a good report about that Master Gotama has circulated thus: That Blessed One is an Arahant, perfectly enlightened, reveals a spiritual life that is perfectly complete and pure. Now it is good to see such Arahants. Then the Kamma of Kesaputta approached the Blessed One. Some paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down on one side. Some kept silent and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the Kamma said to the Blessed One, Bhante, there are some ascetics and brahmins who come to Kesaputta. They explain and elucidate their own doctrines. But disparage, denigrate, deride, and denounce the doctrines of others. But then some other ascetics and brahmins come to Kesaputta, and they too explain and elucidate their own doctrines, but disparage, denigrate, deride, and denounce the doctrines of others. We are perplexed and in doubt, Bhante, as to which of these good ascetics speak truth and which speak falsehood. Okay. Yeah. So you can see this happening even today. There's all kinds of different teachings that are available in the spiritual marketplace and everyone's trying to sell you this or sell you that, so to speak. Even within Buddhism. Okay. There's different parts of Buddhism teaching different things. So people are confused. You know, people who get into meditation or spirituality, they don't know what to believe or like who's right. So this is essentially the same old problem that's come up way back then that still comes up now. It is fitting for you to be perplexed, Kalamas, fitting for you to be in doubt. Doubt has arisen in you about a perplexing matter. Come, Kalamas, do not go by oral tradition, by lineage of teaching. By hearsay, by a collection of scriptures, by logical reasoning, by inferential reasoning, by reasoned cognition, by the acceptance of a view after pondering it, by the seeming competence of a speaker, or because you think this ascetic is our guru. But when, Kalammas, You know for yourself these things are unwholesome. These things are blameworthy. These things are censored by the wise. These things, if accepted and undertaken, lead to harm and suffering. Then you should abandon them. Right. So the reason why I laugh is because, like, I've been exposed to exactly what the Buddha is talking about. In the present day, and he's talked about it way back then. So it's kind of blowing my mind. So most people, when they go to a spiritual tradition, they follow that tradition because either by hearsay, so they just believe what they're saying. That's what hearsay is. Someone tells you something happened, but you weren't there to see it happen. For example, If I tell you that, oh, my teacher, my guru was, is reincarnated version of Sariputta, that would be hearsay, right? Like, how are you fucking supposed to verify that? How are you supposed to believe that? You know, so that's hearsay. That's not something based on experiential wisdom. And that happens a lot. And by a collection of scriptures. So I read the suttas, but I read the suttas because it points to truths that are inherent in my experience now. By logical reasoning. This is another one. A lot of non-duality and Advaita is like this. So they'll use like rationalization and reasoning for why For instance, consciousness is everything or something, or there's only one reality or something like that, something to that extent. And that's why you should be happy. So logical reason, by inferential reasoning, by reason cognition, by acceptance of a view after pondering it. So thinking about someone proposes a view to you, you think about it for long enough, and then you adopt that view as your new paradigm. So really what happens there is you're just replacing one paradigm with another paradigm. So it's not— even though you replaced it with that new fancy spiritual paradigm, it's not really getting to the root of the problem that's causing your suffering. So it still won't satisfy you. Okay. And then here's a good one. This ascetic is our guru. So this is the path of the guru. It's very common in Hinduism and stuff. I mean, I guess it works for some people, but there's always going to be that like childlike dependence on that guru. Oh, it's true because my guru said it is true. He's the guru. No, but when you know for yourselves this is unwholesome, this is causing my suffering. For example, this thought that I'm having right now is unwholesome, and it's causing my suffering. When you know for yourself that by waking up to your own experience, like what's going on in your own experience, that's what lets you abandon that. So that's what puts you on the path to become your own guru, your own Buddha, instead of like believing in hearsay. All right, so I'm going to continue with the sutta. What do you think, Kamma, when greed arises in a person, is it for his welfare or for his harm? For his harm, Bhante. Kamma, a greedy person overcome by greed with a mind obsessed by it destroys life takes what is not given, transgresses with another's wife. Okay, so sleeps with, sleeps with a married woman, or just gets up to all kind of like, like degenerate, like sneaky kind of stuff like that. And speaks falsehood, and he encourages others to do likewise. Will that lead to his harm and suffering for a long time? Yes, Bhante. So I mean, it's not like some kind of spiritual Kamma belief you have to believe. And yeah, go ahead. If you type something, I'll make sure to read it. It's pretty harsh. But yeah, it's not something about like some magical belief in Kamma. It's just common sense. Like if you do If you live your life as a greedy person, that's going to create suffering in your life. That's going to create complications. It's going to create problems. It's going to create a web of lies, right? It's going to create multiple personalities within yourself that you can't just— you're not unified. You're always changing. You're always lying to yourself, even. Justifying your actions so you don't feel guilty about it and lying to other people. And this creates a lot of conflict, a lot of internal misery and anguish. And it just reinforces the cycle of trying to get things from other people, being greedy, you know, being covetous, taking, taking what's not yours, trying to exploit others. Okay, these people are not happy people on the inside. So yeah, that living your life like that does lead to your harm and suffering for a long time. It doesn't mean that Sky Daddy is going to punish you when you die because you've been a bad boy. Like, that's not kind of like woo-woo shit like that. Okay, question, question popped up here in the chat. A woman wakes up post-multiple sitting and relives a childhood abuse situation. She remembers being raped as a child and is angry at the person who hurt her. She's insanely pissed. She's angry as hell. She has a right to be. She needs to express it, right? How do you explain to her hate being unwholesome? I mean, I think that her hatred has to be expressed however she needs to, maybe write it out or beat up a pillow or yell or scream and talk to someone rather than immediately be told it's unwholesome and shove it to their own self? So yeah, this is a really good question. So people who have gone through particularly troubling situations, especially in early childhood, that were so abused and so mistreated, that it would seem kind of strange to tell them, yeah, just don't be mad about that, that's going to hurt you. So there's a time and a place to tell things. Okay. So you don't— so the thing that I would do for this person is not go straight to the contentious issue, those that deep-seated problem. We don't have to think about that right now. We could talk about something else. We could talk about something wholesome, you know, things that get that person smiling, get that person feeling good, get that person not thinking about that stuff. Okay. So not so it's not as if you have to forgive that person necessarily, or, or like kind of go back and solve the problem of the past. No, it's just that right now, if we are thinking about that, that is causing a whole lot of suffering for that person to think about that. And for that anger to come up. So to help this person, you can give them the power, let them know that they have the power themselves to think about something else. Right? To think about something else that's wholesome, something that makes them feel good, something that's healing. Okay. And so to explain it in that way, it's more of a practice to help heal that trauma, rather than solve it or justify it. Right? Of course, this person has a right to be angry. Right? But to somehow explain at the right time, maybe you don't come guns blazing. You're going to say so. So it depends on the context, right? Right. Chances are, if you're talking to this person, You know, you can read different cues and know whether something's the right time to say it. For instance, if they ask you about it, right? I wouldn't even bring it up to begin with. I would just talk about the Dhamma. And the Dhamma, it's for them to know for themselves to let go of that anger internally. I would never tell that person, you need to let go of that anger. It's for them to know to themselves. But I can teach, I can teach universally, the truth that anger leads to your own suffering. That's not a specific teaching. So that applies to everybody, right? And no matter how justified the anger is, that anger is causing suffering. So if anger leads to someone fighting for their freedom, that's, that's a really vague question. That doesn't— like, if you're going to ask a question, it has to be way more specific than that. Because I don't know what you mean by fighting for their freedom. It's totally just kind of a really broad question that I wouldn't be able to answer with any kind of a specific answer. Well, you— so you can take, you can take action to improve your situation without being angry. You can even, let's say, some— you can even kill someone without hating them. Obviously, the Buddha teaches not to take life of a living being, but I'm not of the persuasion that if someone comes into, let's say you have a wife and kids and someone breaks into your house and is going to kill your wife and kids, you can actually— you can actually— yes, anger is bad. That's where it is definitely bad. Anger causes your suffering. But I'm saying is that you can take the right action without hating someone. You can defend yourself without hating someone. You can do what you need to do to protect yourselves and protect your loved ones without hate, without hatred, without enmity. So I— okay, okay, Siraj, these are good questions, but I'm just gonna— I'm gonna continue with the sutta, um, because it gets into that. Like, uh, the Buddha explicitly explains that, uh, anger and hatred does lead to your own harm and suffering. And if you disagree with that, then try it out. Try it out. Try being angry and full of hate and see how that feels. You know, personally, it doesn't feel very good to me. Like in my own experience, it doesn't feel good to hate. You know, when you hate someone, when you're angry, that feels really shitty on the inside. So I'm going to continue with the sutta. If you want to ask another question, you're going to have to pop on the voice and then like maybe we could have a more constructive dialogue. And no, I don't mind, please. I think they're actually very good questions. So I don't mind at all. But for the sake of, I think The reason why I want to get back to the sutta is I think it'll actually answer some of these questions, at least from the perspective of the teaching of the Buddha. All I'm here to do is teach the Buddha Dhamma, not my Dhamma. So this is what the Buddha said, and I follow it, and I found the results for myself. And for anyone who sees the truth of it, they can also come to realize the same fruits, no matter how traumatic of a past that you had. Okay, what do you think, Kamma, when greed— okay, yeah, greed is bad, leads to harm and suffering. Okay, what do you think, Kamma, when hatred arises in a person, is it for his welfare or for his harm? For his harm.

**Speaker B:** Bhante.

**Speaker A:** Kamma, a person who is full of hate, overcome by hatred, with mind obsessed by it, destroys life, and he encourages others to do likewise. Will that lead to his harm and suffering for a long time? Yes, Bhante. What do you think, Kamma, when delusion arises in a person, is it for his welfare or for his harm? For his harm, Bhante. Kamma, a person who is deluded, overcome by delusion, with mind obsessed by it destroys life, and it encourages others to do likewise. Will that lead to his harm and suffering for a long time? Yes, Bhante. Okay, so delusion. Delusion is a very important word, and it's a foundational tenet of Buddhism, or the teachings of the Buddha. Delusion, in a nutshell, is everything we mentally imagine is true, rather than the facts of the matter. Right. So in other words, everything that we imagine is true about the future is not the experience of the future itself. When it comes as a present experience. So that mental imagining, that thought construction that we make, and we take it to be true as if it is actually already happened, or as if it's going to happen, or as if it is happening, that would be delusion. And it's same for the past. So obviously we use thoughts of the past and the future for practical purposes. It's necessary for the survival of our biological organism. And that's why the program is so deeply installed in us to think about the past and the future. I'm not saying to stop thinking about the past and the future, but to not confuse the thought about the past and the future for the reality of our experience, which always comes in the form of a current thought, a current sense perception, and a current feeling, and so on. So to imagine the past and take that as the truth of the situation is delusional. So it's a must— it's a much broader term for delusion than No, like, by this definition, most people alive would be delusional. So I'm not just talking about people who wear tinfoil hats and think that— believe in all kinds of crazy conspiracies and think the aliens are coming to get them or something. I'm not just talking about that kind of delusion, right? I'm talking about the delusion where we imagine all kinds of problems that aren't actually here right now. So we're in a room here, we're safe, there's no danger, but we can imagine all kinds of dangers, either from the past or the future. And then we can think and feel as if they are here right now in reality. So that is what delusion actually is. And yeah, so it's a much Most people in that, by that definition, would be delusional because most people live their lives in the thought construct of the past and the future rather than in the senses. So in the experience of the breath right now, in the experience of the body right now, and just staying in that and only using thoughts of the past and future for practical purposes. So, you know, to navigate your life, to sustain your livelihood, to take care of your loved ones, to do whatever it is you need to do. All those thoughts are useful and practical. I'm not saying those are delusional. I'm talking about the thoughts about the past and the future that they have no practical benefit. And the sole purpose of those thoughts is creating psychological suffering for yourself unnecessarily. So the good news is that we can actually get rid of all this unnecessary mental activity, and we can avoid a whole ton of mental anguish and suffering because of that. Okay. Okay, what do you think, Kalamas? Are these things unwholesome or Or are these things wholesome or unwholesome? Unwholesome, Bhante. Blameworthy or blameless? Blameworthy, Bhante. Censured or praised by the wise? Censured by the wise, Bhante. Accepted and undertaken, do they lead to harm and suffering or not? Or how do you take it? Accepted and undertaken. These things lead to harm and suffering, so we take it. All right, so just realizing in your direct experience for yourself whether something is causing you mental suffering right now, that's for you to know. Okay? Not me for not for me to preach and you to believe it. The only thing I'm recommending here is looking at the activity of your own mind and seeing for yourself, is this painful? That's it. If it's not painful, enjoy it, right? If you enjoy hating people, be my guest. You know, nobody's stopping you. It's a free country. All right, that got a laugh out of Sirash. So all right, thus Kalamas, when we said, come Kalamas, do not go by oral tradition, but when you know for yourself these things are unwholesome, these things are blameworthy, these things are censored by the wise These things, if undertaken and practiced, lead to harm and suffering, then you should abandon them. Yeah, but so yeah, it's the important thing is don't abandon them by hearsay because it's a moral code that you're following out of fear, right? Abandon them out of the wisdom that you've seen for yourself that, oh, this is hurting me, so I'm going to stop doing that, right? It's like you put your hand in the flame. You get, you feel the pain, and then, you know, your monkey brain makes the connection. Oh, fire in hand, hot, take out. Kammaklammas, do not go by oral tradition, but when you know for yourself These things are unwholesome. These things are blameworthy. These things are censored by the wise. Come, Kalamas, do not go by old tradition, by lineage of teaching, by hearsay. Yeah, go ahead, leave. Nobody's forcing you to be here. Please leave.

**Speaker B:** No, I want to join.

**Speaker A:** Oh yes, join, join, join. Of course, I thought you were saying to— no, no, no, yeah, that, that, no, that's wonderful. Uh, of course.

**Speaker B:** I don't know your name.

**Speaker A:** Uh, my name is Scott.

**Speaker B:** But you know, I think you are a Kamma.

**Speaker A:** What is a Kamma?

**Speaker B:** You, the people you're reading about, you know, you can't just, you can't go by the text, you You can't go by the oral, oral, oral, whatever, you know, the oral knowledge, the logical reasoning, the conscience. I mean, you yourself have to use your lived experience, you know, and answer a question. You can't just read a thing and— first of all, I mean, I respect you working so hard to find these texts, and I myself, whenever we all as meditators, we love finding these old texts and reading them, but we have to You know, you gotta respect their limitations. They are translations. The, you know, non-hatred is— he didn't write in English. The Buddha spoke in Pali, which was then translated over and over again until you got non-hatred. And, you know, I just feel like, Scott, there is a problem in, in what in this thing that we do, which is we, we are just making it another kind of Catholic Church where it's like you have to be this perfect Jesus-like figure, you know. You have to be this perfect Arahant who doesn't hate, he doesn't have anger, he has no greed. I'm pretty sure if the Buddha existed and somebody came to his monastery and broke the rules, he would be very vicious and cruel and immediately, you know, reprimand them. But then also, I mean, there had to be an order to have a society and a civilization, you know. And I mean, I myself live in India, we have heard all these stories from our childhood. And I just want to tell you that, you know, there's a certain naiveness and childlike innocence in the way you approach it, which is why it's so beautiful and why you're so— you are innocent, you are, but you are also just repressing the evil inside you, you know, which is— I just want to say that that evil is also— the Buddha also had that evil part in him, which— and it's not necessarily a bad part, you know, it's a part that he, I think, fully accepted. And being hateful, being angry, having all these things is a part of it. And I think that as a culture, as people— you, I don't know what happened to you when you were a kid, whether your relationship with your parents was— other people have, you know. But a lot of hurt people come to Buddhism because it does give them a sense of peace. And a lot of the times we repress a lot of shit that happened to us. We just fucking shove it down and wear another kind of a necktie, which is this I'm a peaceful Buddhist dude now and I'm just watching my sensations. I get it, we're all watching our sensations, we're being economists with them, but not at the cost of repressing our entire lives and also acknowledging all the other new technologies in the world— psychology, journaling. And you know, I mean, you yourself were like low-key taking a dump on Vedanta in this talk, and I also find them really funny being Hindu. I find them really ridiculous. But like, yo, that's exactly what the Kamma was talking about. These dudes come to the Buddha and then they take a shit on all these other things, and they delay, you know, they'll say this is crap, that's good, this is it. You know, you're right, nothing's changed since then till now. That's what you said in the beginning, and you're right about that. But let's put a fucking mirror in front of this thing, dog. Let's do that. Let's be real, man, because like, this ain't it. This is not just it, right? There is I mean, we cannot just become robots of like sensation observing robots and then go till the grass and feed the cow and then meditate. I mean, you have a lived experience, you gotta acknowledge. You can't just dissect yourself and be this perfect ideal. And that's what I mean.

**Speaker A:** I never claimed that. I never claimed that I was this perfect ideal. I don't claim that. I'm just talking about the practice. So I'm talking about for the purpose of meditation here. So like, yeah, I get angry, you know, and I've had a lot of problems with getting angry and a lot of anger and resentment towards my father and like what he did to me. But actually undertaking this practice has greatly improved my anger tendencies. Does it mean I never get angry? No, but my happiness has increased as a result of this practice by a huge margin. So I'm not saying— so yeah, like, I'm not trying to make this another, like, religious dogma, which for some people it will be. And even if it is a religious dogma, it's still better than just going out and hating without any restraint and.

**Speaker B:** Just, you know, I agree with what you mean in one way, but no, because even if it's not, if you're not just hating out like that and you are in a dogmatic sense holding yourself down, you are carrying a huge burden and that is not what the Buddha wanted you to do.

**Speaker A:** And I agree, I agree with you.

**Speaker B:** He doesn't want you to be like, you know, you're pissed at your dad, you did Your dad did some hateful shit and it's okay for you to hate him, bro. It is okay. The Buddha would be like, okay, your dad, not cool. And you know what I find, and I understand that we have these lofty heights of ideals set up for all of us saying that like, hey man, forgiveness, we must forgive everybody.

**Speaker A:** No, we can't forgive everybody. That's what I'm saying. I'm not even saying you need to forgive it. I'm saying that you went obsessing about, thinking about over and over, your dad who's not here right now, and causing yourself all kinds of anger and hatred to come up and all kinds of psychological suffering to come up now. I'm not talking about ever, I'm just talking about right now. That tendency to obsess about it will make you feel like shit.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that's a fact.

**Speaker A:** And that's what I'm saying. I'm saying, and then if you go to your dad and you ask, oh, how, like, he, he felt the same way about his dad, who felt the same way about his dad. So it's like you can carry that hatred and then end up being the same person your dad was to your kids, or you can change the tendency and realize, oh, I don't have to obsess about people who wronged me. I cannot think about that. If someone is wronging you, I'm not saying be totally passive. Oh, I need to be a saint and just accept it. No, I'm saying defend yourself. Do what you need to do. I'm not saying that. I'm not preaching anything like that. Yeah, but I'm saying you obsessing mentally over shit that you're imagining about that happened in the past. No matter how traumatic, will cause you pain right now. And that you're right, like there's certain situations where that may be too blunt or upfront to just say that to them right away. So there may be stepping stones to that for them, most importantly for them to realize it for themselves. That's true.

**Speaker B:** But I'll be very honest with you, I don't even care if the perpetrators realize it or not, because you know what? Because they did what they could and they are a different generation. Let's just figure out us, right? Yeah, that's all we really can do. We can't go and change 35, 40 generations, but if we can change us, then our kids and people around us, that's what matters, not them. Number 2, what I think is more important than all the other stuff, like how you're going to go and talk to them and stuff which we just discussed is solutions, right? And realistic solutions when we have a hell lot of anger and it is Jais. There's a word that we use in India called Jais, right? And it means rightful because children cannot defend themselves, right? The Buddha never said, yo, beat children up. The Buddha would never— the Buddha never said that. Right, so people doing that, they're not doing what Buddha would not like, that right? Buddha had made distinctions between what he liked and he didn't like. Anyway, my point is we need solutions, okay? We need solutions for this trauma. Now Vipassana, Buddhism, all stuff is keeping us, making us enjoy our lives for once. And I know what you mean, I can see it in you, bro. We are the same in that way. We came to Buddhism, we came to this meditation thing and we found that little piece, that little tiny droplet of peace somewhere inside the Anapanasati that took us, and it really does help. But I'm telling you one thing, man, you are sitting on a dragon of anger and hatred, and you cannot hold that dragon down with a bottle cap.

**Speaker A:** Here's the problem with you, Siraj.

**Speaker B:** No, no, let me finish.

**Speaker A:** You're trying to tell me what's happening with me when you don't know what the fuck that you're talking about. You're just saying bullshit out of your mouth.

**Speaker B:** Let me finish.

**Speaker A:** You cannot say anything about what I experienced on the inside.

**Speaker B:** Let me finish.

**Speaker A:** No, no, no, I'm not going to let you finish. I'm not going to let you finish. I'm not fighting you, bro.

**Speaker B:** Listen, I heard what you're saying.

**Speaker A:** It's for you to know for yourself, Shiraz.

**Speaker B:** No, just be a little equanimous, man. Just be a little equanimous.

**Speaker A:** Just take it easy. No, because you don't come here and tell me commands tell me what I'm feeling and then tell me what to do.

**Speaker B:** I'm not speaking about you, not speaking about you, bro. I'm speaking about myself. I'm speaking about people I know.

**Speaker A:** I know you're talking about yourself.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** So keep it to yourself, buddy. That's exactly what I'm saying. You know, go and take your advice, go and take your teaching and go shove it up your ass. That's what I'm saying.

**Speaker B:** Don't be a little— don't like— don't get so afraid and Don't panic right now.

**Speaker A:** I'm not afraid, bro. I'm telling you the truth. Like, there may be some other people that sit and like, maybe you come into contact with other people in your life that sit and listen to like what you're telling to them. No, but I'm not one of those people, Siraj. I do not give a fuck about what you have to say.

**Speaker B:** Look, you're talking about Buddha, Buddha, Buddha. This— I'm from this country, all right?

**Speaker A:** We have— I do not give a fuck where you're from, Siraj.

**Speaker B:** We have a history.

**Speaker A:** I do not care if you're from into that. I don't care if your grandpa was the Maharashi or whatever. Maharashi? I do not care if he was, uh, whatever place you— let me finish, man.

**Speaker B:** Let me finish. It wasn't personal, Scott. Calm down, man. I'm not trying to fight you, bro. I have nothing to gain from this, so please don't make this about you and me, all right? It's not a fight. Let me just finish, man.

**Speaker A:** I don't play games with you, Sirash. I don't.

**Speaker B:** It comes either, Scott. I'm just listening to you and I'm calling out what I think is bullshit. You can call out what you think is bullshit.

**Speaker A:** Well, I don't give a fuck. You can go fuck off. Like, I do not give a fuck what you think.

**Speaker B:** You are a child with your own cricket ball and your own cricket bat and you want to play yourself on me, bro. You're not going to grow like that. I don't give a fuck. But that's on you if you are not able to have a— All right.

**Speaker A:** Have a good one, Siraj, bro.

**Speaker B:** You have to grow.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, hosted by **Speaker A (Scott)**, centers on the **Kalama Sutta (AN 3.65)** and evolves into a passionate debate about the practical application of the Dhamma, especially regarding trauma and anger. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Main Themes of the Talk**
1.  **The Purpose of Meditation:** Scott begins by explaining that formal meditation is a tool to observe the mind's habitual tendencies—especially the unwholesome thoughts (worries, anger, greed) that arise when we are still. Seeing these patterns clearly is the first step to changing them and ending psychological suffering.
2.  **The Core Teaching: The Kalama Sutta:** Scott reads the sutta, which advises the Kalamas (and all seekers) **not** to accept teachings based on:
    *   Oral tradition, scripture, logical reasoning, inferential reasoning, or the authority of a guru.
    *   Instead, one should know for oneself: "These things are unwholesome, blameworthy, censured by the wise; when undertaken, they lead to harm and suffering." Only then should one abandon them.
3.  **The Three Poisons:** The sutta highlights that **greed, hatred, and delusion** lead to harmful actions and long-term suffering for the one who harbors them. Scott emphasizes this is a matter of observable cause and effect, not a dogmatic moral rule or "woo-woo" karma.
4.  **Delusion Defined:** Scott offers a practical definition: delusion is mistaking our mental constructs (thoughts about the past/future) for present reality, especially when those thoughts create unnecessary psychological suffering.

### **The Debate with Speaker B (Siraj)**
The talk becomes a heated dialogue when Siraj joins and challenges the interpretation:

*   **Siraj's Critique:** He argues that Scott's approach risks creating a new dogma—a "perfect Buddhist ideal" that can lead to repression. He stresses that anger, especially from severe trauma like childhood abuse, is valid and needs expression (through journaling, therapy, etc.), not immediate suppression as "unwholesome." He warns against using Dhamma to "shove down" legitimate pain.
*   **Scott's Rebuttal:** Scott clarifies he is **not** advocating for repression or forced forgiveness. His point is practical: **obsessing** over past wrongs *in the present moment* causes present suffering. The practice is about learning to not dwell on those thoughts, not about denying the anger exists. He agrees action can be taken without hatred.
*   **The Escalation:** The discussion becomes personal and confrontational. Siraj implies Scott is repressing his own "dragon of anger," and Scott reacts defensively, telling Siraj to "go fuck off." This live demonstration underscores the very challenge being discussed: dealing with anger when it arises.

### **Conclusion**
The talk illustrates the tension between:
*   **The Ideal:** The Buddha's timeless instruction to abandon unwholesome states after seeing they cause inner suffering.
*   **The Practical Human Challenge:** How to apply this to deep-seated trauma without being dismissive or dogmatic, and how to navigate righteous anger.

Scott maintains the Dhamma is a tool for self-observation and release from suffering, not a repressive dogma. Siraj insists on the necessity of integrating modern therapeutic approaches and fully acknowledging emotional pain. The heated exchange itself becomes a case study in the difficulty of practicing equanimity when one's views are directly challenged.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to illustrate their points about meditation, the mind, and the Buddha's teachings:

### Metaphors:
1.  **Meditation as a Mirror or Diagnostic Tool:** The act of formal meditation is described as an opportunity to see "what the mind does habitually." When you stop interacting with the world, the thoughts that arise reveal your internal tendencies. This is likened to finding "the culprit that's causing you suffering."
2.  **Unwholesome Tendencies as a "Reaction Mechanism":** The speaker describes unwholesome mental habits not as a personal flaw ("my mind is like shitty") but as a "reaction mechanism that's been installed in your brain" by past conditions. This mechanistic metaphor emphasizes that these patterns can be changed through awareness.
3.  **The "Spiritual Marketplace":** When introducing the Kalamas' dilemma, the speaker uses this modern metaphor to compare ancient competing ascetics to today's plethora of spiritual teachings and teachers "trying to sell you this or that."
4.  **Thoughts as Useful Tools vs. Sources of Suffering:** The speaker distinguishes between practical thoughts (for survival, livelihood) and delusional ones. Delusion is metaphorically described as living inside a "thought construct of the past and the future" rather than in present sensory experience.
5.  **The Flame and the Hand:** To illustrate the Buddha's instruction to abandon unwholesome things based on direct experience, the speaker uses the classic metaphor: "It's like you put your hand in the flame. You feel the pain, and then... your monkey brain makes the connection. Oh, fire in hand, hot, take out."

### Stories & Parables:
1.  **The Story of the Kalamas (AN 3.65):** This is the central story of the talk. The speaker reads and interprets the sutta where the Buddha visits the town of Kesaputta. The Kalamas are confused by conflicting spiritual teachings. The Buddha famously advises them **not** to rely on:
    *   Oral tradition
    *   Lineage
    *   Hearsay
    *   Scripture
    *   Logical reasoning
    *   Inferential reasoning
    *   The apparent competence of a speaker
    *   The fact that "this ascetic is our guru"
    Instead, they should know for themselves what leads to harm and suffering (greed, hatred, delusion) and abandon it. The speaker uses this story to warn against dogmatic belief and to emphasize personal, experiential verification of the Dhamma.
2.  **The Anecdote of the Childhood Abuse Survivor:** A participant asks a hypothetical question about a woman who, after meditation, relives childhood rape and feels intense, justified anger. The speaker and the participant (**Siraj**) use this story to debate how to apply the teaching on hatred (*dosa*). It becomes a real-life test case for the principle that anger leads to personal suffering, even when it is understandable. This story drives the main conflict of the discussion.
3.  **The Home Intruder Scenario:** To clarify that "right action" can be taken without hatred, the speaker offers a brief hypothetical story: if an intruder threatens your family, you can defend them "without hate, without enmity." This story is used to separate ethical action from unwholesome mental states.
4.  **Personal Anecdote (Implied):** The speaker briefly references their own anger and resentment towards their father, using their personal story as evidence that the practice has "greatly improved my anger tendencies" and increased happiness. This is offered as a counterpoint to Siraj's accusation of repression.

### Key Narrative Arc:
The talk itself follows a story-like structure:
*   **Setup:** Introduction to meditation as a way to see the mind's habits.
*   **Introduction of the Core Teaching/Story:** The Kalamas Sutta is presented as the answer to spiritual confusion.
*   **Challenge & Test:** The hypothetical story of the abuse survivor tests the teaching in a difficult, real-world context.
*   **Debate & Conflict:** Siraj joins, challenging a dogmatic interpretation of the teaching and accusing the speaker (and by extension, some Buddhists) of repressing natural emotions to fit a "perfect ideal."
*   **Climax:** The debate becomes heated, with the speaker angrily rejecting Siraj's personal analysis. This moment ironically *demonstrates* the very anger the teaching discusses.
*   **Resolution (Abrupt):** The talk ends without a neat resolution, leaving the core tension—between ideal teaching and messy human experience—unresolved, mirroring the Kalamas' own state of perplexity.
