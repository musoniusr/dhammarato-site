### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, so welcome to the Sunday afternoon Thai time call. We do these every week, and I'm really pleased to see so many happy people on the call. Gary has asked a question most specifically about the third Tatrad of the Anapanasati Sutta. And so we'll dig into that for a while. Now, the first thing that we want to say is that this tetrad, or this aspect, the third, which is known in the Pali as Citta Nupassana or Citta Nupassana, depending upon the way that you pronounce it. And that this has to do with the Citta, or the mind, that is more of a feeling rather than a thinking part of the mind. Now, the feeling kind of the mind is, oh, let us say almost all of our feelings come from our memories about how to feel. We've learned how to feel from infancy. A lot of the way that we feel comes right out of the DNA. Fear, for instance, or satisfaction when we get a good taste and things like this is kind of built into the DNA. And one of the things that's not built into the DNA is English language, especially not Harvard English language. That's not built in. So that means then that when we are gladdening the mind, we're not necessarily talking about talking ourselves into gladdening the mind, but rather we're changing the mind state. Now, item number 9 on the list is investigation, most specifically investigating the states of mind. In other words, that which is the mind part of our feeling system, the state of mind that we're in, will in fact determine both how we feel and the thoughts we have if we are practicing ignorantly. In other words, the DNA or the foundation of that is that the Citta is the part of the mind that has everything to do with our attitude or the state of mind that we're in. Now, there's various states of mind. One of them would be bright, shining. Another word that's used is exalted. Another word that's used is dull. Another word that's used is kind of ordinary. And that most people are stuck in an ordinary state of mind, and I would consider that ordinary state of mind, I would use the the term victim, that the ordinary state of mind is an ordinary victim state of mind. And when I use the word victim, I'm not accusing anybody of being beat up when they were a child, victimized, tortured, or anything, but I'm talking about it in the sense of that we feel dependent. We feel like that we not only belong to something, but there is an authority there someplace. In other words, when Fritz Perls was talking about it, he would use the term top dog and underdog, and we almost always feel like the underdog in the sense that here we are on our back with our paws in the air, and there's a great big animal right on top of us. Now, for Christians, that great big god-dog on top of us is dog spelled backwards. Islam is even worse. They've got a gorilla on top of them. But the point is, is that We feel like that we're out of control in the sense of everything runs us. One of the qualities then of the top dog would be our destiny. What runs your life? What controls you? This is an ordinary state of mind. But as we brighten the mind, gladden the mind, make the mind sharp, make the mind flexible, we come out of that ordinary, dull state of mind into more like the mindset that you would consider the mindset of a winner, the mindset of a champion, the mindset of the top dog, rather than the mindset of the bottom dog. Now, how do we basically do this? Because if we are in a victim's mind state, that gives us the kind of thoughts of a mind state like that. And what are those kind of thoughts that we would have? We'd have words like work, this is hard, I'll try with the intention of failure, and other things like this. That Kawanko actually says you got to work. He says it like that too. You got to work. Okay, well, working is something that victims do. It's an attitude that we have, the attitude of being under the pressure of something bigger and greater than ourselves, including our feelings, and our mind state. That we have the victim's mind state, we've got to work. And so if we begin to investigate our mind state, a best way to do that is by talking about ourselves in the sense of, what kind of attitude do I have now? What kind of state of mind is this? And so, if we have that, we can, by investigating it— the easy place to start, by the way, is to look at the kind of thoughts that we have. But as you've heard me say, remember that the thoughts that we have are basically determined by the mind states that we're in. And by the way, the thoughts that we have, the temporary little things that arise and pass away, thoughts, etc., like that, is called the Dhammanupassana, as opposed to the Citta Nupassana. So we're talking about the Citta Nupassana, but we really can't talk about it without also introducing and talking about the Dhamma Nupassana, because we use the Dhamma Nupassana to help recondition. That one of the things that we can say that is actually listed as in the I think it's step 8, which is actually in the Vedana, the Pasana. Step 8 talks about the mind conditioner. Now, people who read it from left to right or from beginning to end, they will misunderstand that the mind conditioner is only the feelings, that our feelings condition the mind. And when they do that, they get that kind of backwards because because normally it's our state of mind that determines our feelings, and that they're interrelated. For instance, if you're in a state of pain, or if you're in a state of fear, then that's going to determine— in fact, which came first in this regard? We don't have to get into chicken and egg jokes, because we all know by now that eggs are really ancient. There'd been eggs around for millions of years, but chicken's the name of a bird that was developed less than 200 years ago. So we don't have to worry about which came first, the chicken or the egg. But let's ask this question: which comes first, the attitude that we have or the feeling that we have? A lot of times it'll just be that we just get a feeling and we don't know where it comes from, but that feeling that we get certainly goes along with a particular attitude. So if you are in pain, then the attitude will be generally, "Oh, poor me. Oh, I don't like this feeling." This sensation, I don't like it. So in that case, you can see that the Vedana, the feeling, is actually conditioning the mind state. However, if we have developed the mind state, then through the development, through the skill development, we can turn that around in the sense of that you can begin to feel the way you want to feel because you have developed the mind state that you want to have. So these two things, and I'll mention it in this way, the investigation of the mind state and the gladdening the mind are kind of the first items on the list of things that we're doing. But if you look closely at the Anapanasati Sutta, you'll see first off that it's in 4 tetrads. The tetrad is the Kamma Nupassana, the Vedana Nupassana, the Citta Nupassana, and the Dhamma Nupassana, those 4. But each one of them have a subdivision. In the sense that in the body, we start with the breathing in and out, and that's the first two items on the list. And then later we begin to practice step 3 and step 4. So you can see that step 4, relaxing the body, is actually more of an outcome of the first half. The same thing is true with the Vedana, that in the Vedana we have the Sukkha and the Piti, and then we see the conditioner, and then being able to soften that or manipulate it, or in the sense of the way that I'm talking about it, turn it around. But we have to practice it in the first two first. Okay, so now we're in the Citta Nipassana, the gladdening of the mind and the investigation of the mind states comes first. And we need to get really good at that so that we can gladden the mind and we can change the mind state so that we can then eventually practice The second half of that, which would be then step 11 and 12, if we call them steps, perhaps better is idam, which would be to unify the mind and liberate the mind. Those are the two that are in there. Right? Is that right, Gary?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that is what I was really thinking about. I mean, thoroughly, I'm looking now at the Anapanasati Sutta as it's set out in the book In Mindfulness with Breathing by Bhuddhadassa. And he's got The translation is he's thoroughly experiencing at number 9, gladdening the mind at number 10. Then you've got concentrating at number 11 and liberating at number 12. Well, I suppose my problem is with, you see, I can understand gladdening the mind. I can understand trying to experience the mind. What am I? I suppose that is Citta Nupassana. What am I? What am I? What is my state of mind? What is my mental state? What am I sort of generally feeling in the mind? But then we get to concentrating and liberating.

**Speaker C:** Now.

**Speaker B:** Concentrating, duh, what are you? You know, one thinks of concentrating the mind, of thinking of something specific.

**Speaker A:** Well, yes, I am. And the first thing to go for is now we are involved with a bad translation.

**Speaker B:** Right, okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And that the word traditionally from the 1880s, Samadhi, has been, let us say, universally translated as concentration. Yeah, which is in some context correct, but in most of the context it's not correct. That a better word that we could use would be unification of mind, or bringing the mind together. Now that would also be the kind of way that we would have concentration. Is bringing together, unifying, etc., like that. So let's take the example that we're going to make a cake, right? And we've got eggs in refrigerator, if you can afford them, and you got some milk in a carton in the refrigerator, and you've got some flour in the flour bin, and you've got some butter also in a package in the refrigerator. All of those ingredients are separated. There's no cake there. Is that correct? All right, Deidre, when you're making a cake, other than perhaps vanilla extract or perhaps chocolate, what else have you put in a cake other than the flour and the eggs and the milk and the butter?

**Speaker D:** My love and attention. Energy.

**Speaker A:** Actually, that's spot on. Okay, that's spot on. Now, if we in fact crack the eggs and start beating them, or let us say it in another way, my grandmother made biscuits and I saw her make this. She made biscuits every day. She would make biscuits. People loved them at the rest home. And so she made biscuits every day. And the way that she would do it is she'd lay out the flour on the board that she had. She had a great big board that was in a stand-up kind of closet that she called a pantry, not a room. But in that pantry, she had a great big pull-down bin that had flour. And she had this big board that she would take out and put on the counter, and then she would take the flour and put it off on this great big board that she had. And then she would take water or milk in a bowl and dip her fingers in it and sprinkle that water or that milk on the flour to start making dough out of it. Now that we have a mixing bowl, we don't generally do it that way. We kind of just throw things together. So you throw a couple of cups of flour in it, couple of eggs in it, put some milk in it, put the butter in it, and then let the electric machine start grinding and stirring that stuff up, right? In a way, is that not in fact to make that cake? You're unifying it, especially if you're putting the wise attention in it that you're talking about, Deidre. Wise loving attention. But also, that not only unifies that stuff, but it also kind of concentrates it, because it was all in disperse places. You had the flour here and the butter there and the eggs over there, and now you're taking them and putting all together and mixing them up. Is that not kind of a concentration? Okay, so what we're saying then is there are various kinds of elements of the mind. There's the vocal part of the mind in the In the Pali canon suttas, we would talk about it in the sense of the Samskara and the perceptions and all of that kind of stuff that lead to various places. But when we have the mind that is unified, when the mind is collected together, that already means that we've been able to take the Citta and gladden it to the point that it's changed the attitude. And then we have the perspective of the feelings, which would be then the Sukkha and the Piti, which is a wow sensation. And then we would also have the body that is relaxed, and understood. And so what we're doing is we're collecting all of that stuff together to unify the mind. All right. And what— when we're doing all of that, what that really then eventually means is that we're going to liberate it from being cake dough into being a cake. We're going to We're going to put that turkey in the oven and we're going to bake it. And when it is that, that means it's a finished product. And in that regard, that means you can no longer separate the eggs. In fact, when they're really, really mixed together, it's really hard to separate it. So they're unified. But the liberation comes then as the extra topping on that. Okay, so that's what we mean by liberating the mind, which means that now the mind is no longer under the thumb, it's no longer the bottom dog, it's no longer subject to feelings that we don't have any control over. We can think the thoughts that we want to think, we can feel the way we want to feel, We have the attitude that we want to have, that's freedom, as opposed to being under a ball and chain, which means we're being controlled by our DNA, by our instincts, that we have real freedom. So that's the fourth item on the list, that's the goal in fact of the Buddhist teaching of the Buddha. You can also go so far as to say the concentration part, or the Samadhi part, is also what is required for the knowledge part. The knowledge and then the liberation is the same as the deliverance. And so, by the way, the word for this deliverance or this freedom in the Pali is moksha, and in Thai language it's mok. Mikey, picking on you. Have you ever heard the word Mok before?

**Speaker E:** Wat Suwan Mok.

**Speaker A:** Precisely. It means the garden. Suwan is the word for garden. The Garden of Liberation. Okay, actually that's only part of the name. That's the common name. It also has Balaram. 'Watsuanmokkabalaram.' Now, what that means, if you know Latin, there is— in fact, I'll give you the English language— belligerent, 'bellum,' which has to do with power. So basically what we mean by 'Watsuanmokkabalaram' is that it is a royal power of liberation. And this is the garden for that, the royal power of liberation. So that's what the pool thing means. This is really what the Buddha's teaching is really all about, is that knowledge and deliverance, which is also moksha. This is what we're doing, is we're becoming free. Free from what? What are we being free from? I've already said it. Ivan, give it a go. When we're saying free— by the way, before you answer, I'll give you this: there's two kinds of freedom. One is freedom to— for instance, the teenage boy wants to borrow the keys to the car from his dad so that he because he wants to have freedom to travel. But if that kid had freedom from, he wouldn't ask his dad for the keys because he'd be free from the travel. And so the teaching of the Buddha is all about freedom from, not freedom to. So in that regard, Ivan, what are we free from?

**Speaker C:** From our own dissatisfaction.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker C:** Our own dissatisfaction.

**Speaker A:** Right, freedom from dissatisfaction. Precisely, we're free from the Dukkha. This is the Dukkha, Nirodha. But I would go a little bit further than that and say it in this way. We're free from everything, except for God, in the sense of gravity. We'll never be free from gravity. But other than that, we're free from society, we're free from the blues, we're free from music, we're free from cell phones, including the internet. We've got real freedom. Which means we're not dependent upon anything. Oh, so we've got a couple of hands up. Deidre, you go first.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, uh, I'm going a few steps before, like when Jerry asked about the concentration and that you said it was the wrong translation. Is that okay? So there's also in step— I don't know if it's about translation again, because now I'm translating it from a Dutch paper— that it also says like the mind is broadened or narrowed. That would be then step 9.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker D:** Before that it says, and then it says, yeah, over Tathagata, it says, uh, like.

**Speaker A:** Uh, how about constricted as opposed to narrow versus expansive for broad?

**Speaker D:** Constricted, oh, expansive. Okay, but the next step is then unsurpassed or passed, like Oh no, like a success or not.

**Speaker A:** Right? It has the quality of success. Here's a kind of interesting way to do this, and that is to say, wow, have I ever been in this kind of state before? This would be exalted. I'm now in an exalted place because I've never been here before. Wow, this is really, really great. And then the next time when you have that exalted, you say, oh wow, I've been here and done that.

**Speaker D:** So that's the unsurpassed step.

**Speaker A:** Surpassed, exactly. Unsurpassed, exalted, broad.

**Speaker D:** Okay, that clarifies it more. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Okay, as opposed to narrow-minded. Do you know what narrow— that's an English language expression but you can see people who are what? Narrow-minded means that they're not open, they've already formed their opinions, which basically what an opinion is, is what? A delusion. So narrow-mindedness means that we are deluded, we think we know. But when the mind is broadened, when it's exalted, we're kind of open to new things. We're investigating, we want to investigate. And in fact, a narrow mind does not want to investigate. That's part of the quality of it. Why does he not want to investigate? Because he might find something that disagrees with his opinion. Well, who did that? Let's see if I can straighten that back out. Grid view. There we go. All right, so we've been there, we've been there and done that.

**Speaker D:** Um, very much unsurpassed, right?

**Speaker A:** That's another one, is unsurpassed. You can see all— in fact, all of these terms that— most of this, by the way, comes out of the, um, uh, a list that is in the Satipatthana Sutta, where we investigate the mind to see, and that they have quite a number of words, exalted, in your case broadened, unsurpassed, all of those kinds of words, is to really look at what you're doing. Are you the top dog? Another word to use would be the lion. But that's a really, really high-quality attitude. Not that you're out on the hunt, but that you can stand on that ridge and roar. So, Amrit, go right ahead. You got a question?

**Speaker F:** Yeah, I have a question about.

**Speaker E:** You.

**Speaker F:** Were talking about the cake and you are bringing everything together, the flour and the sugar and the butter. And I was thinking of like when I used to do Anapanasati in the past, I was usually using Thanisaro Bhikkhu's method. It's mostly trying to observe the breath and try to take a breath which you feel good. And now I also added what you say is the verbal fabrication, right? So you are also adding the verbal part of the mind where you are saying everything is good, nothing to do, nowhere to go. And is it kind of going to that direction that we are adding different parts of the mind and bringing them all together and making them all Kind of concentrate.

**Speaker A:** I'm having a little trouble hearing you. Mikey, can you interpret what he said?

**Speaker E:** What are you talking about bringing together Amitabh in the mind?

**Speaker F:** The verbal fabrication I think what Dhammarato says, like everything is good, everything is all right. So this is the verbal part. And then there is this when you're breathing, right? So there is like this.

**Speaker E:** I think maybe this. Yeah, the verbal fabrication, like the wholesome thought fabrication.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes. Okay. Actually, in Sutta number 9, where Sariputta is talking about Paticcasamuppada. By the way, the name of that sutta is Right View. And there he mentions 3 kinds of Samskara: the bodily Samskara, the feeling Samskara, and the mental Sankhara. Now, I think that the translation for the mental is actually going to be Citta. So, we do have things built up in the body, and that what we're actually practicing here, when we're unifying the mind, is to get the body to relax. Because we actually carry many kinds of tension, around. And so when we relax the body, that means that the body is free from tension. But the word, the question that we're looking at here is that verbal part of the mind. Now the verbal part of the mind can have, we can talk about it from psychology, would be the cortex, the mammalian cortex, This is where we do most of our learning. The mammalian cortex is what they train in school. When the monks are memorizing sutras, they're practicing the mammalian brain. When the kids are learning a song, they're putting it, storing it in the mammalian brain. When our parents are fussing at us, we store that in the mammalian brain. That mammalian brain is also what we would call or consider anything that we would have that would be verbal. Okay, for instance, all the rules that we have, all the songs that you know, All of the poems that you know are all stored in that mammalian part of the brain. Now, often for humans, the mammalian part of the brain is at odds with the Citta. So going back then, Gary, to the part of the brain of the unification, it's to bring our rule systems and our feeling systems together. And the Buddha would recommend that we operate with them differently. And one of the ways is, when you're making a rule, when you have a concept, the Buddha talks about that as kind of attachments to laws, rules, rituals, ceremonies, ways of doing things. And in fact, some artists are very good at copying another artist. So good, in fact, that they'll paint something and then sell it as if it were an original. Another one would be counterfeiting, like counterfeiting money, or in the in the face of China, counterfeiting every product that you can find, counterfeiting cell phones, counterfeiting even food. So, this actually is that part of the brain that the Buddha uses the word Sila, Bhavana, Paramasa. And the operative word is the Sila. Which means the supposed to's, our morality. Our morality is always done in verbal language, just like laws are written in the book. That's all verbal, right? And that we always are at odds with the way that we feel versus the way that it's supposed to be. In fact, that there's a three-way disharmony or disunity. When they talk about unity and duality, most of the time we're in triality, we're in a three-way mix. So what are the three ways? One is the Citta. We feel and we have this attitude, and then we have all of the verbal, which would be the rules, the way it's supposed to be, and so we're often in conflict between what we want and what's supposed to be. And then there's the third one, and that is reality. So we look at reality and we want it to be different, and we also look at reality and say, "Aha, it's breaking the rules," and oftentimes the rule and what we want is different. But guess who wins? Mikey, wake up! Who wins?

**Speaker E:** The one that's free.

**Speaker A:** Well, the one that's real. Reality. This is the third one. Often our rules are saying, oh, we should improve this thing. And then the feeling is that, "Oh, I don't like it," and the reality doesn't get changed because I don't like it or because it breaks the rules. Reality is reality. And so we need to put that into the mix. And when we are able to let us say, control the feelings, and when we can disregard the rules and the supposed-tos, then we can deal with reality. This is what we would then be in the state of Samadhi, which means that we've gotten everything organized together, we're at unity, at one-ment, atonement rather than in a state of duality or triality. So, if we can bring our mind to that state, isn't that in fact one of the ways of talking about freedom, moksha, liberation, deliverance? What are we delivered from? Our own personal internal disharmony, our own disunity. So this is what we mean, and in fact you could say, in a way, that Step 12 is in fact the goal, and that is the liberation of the mind that is already unified, because we can control the way that our attitude is, and that our attitude then controls our feelings so that we can feel the way that we want to feel, we have the attitude of being on top of the world, we have the mind that is unified and free. So now we have to look at, well, what about the Anicca, Dhamma, and Upadana? If we look at it, we can see that item 13 on the list is all about Anicca. When we begin to see that our mind's thoughts are very, very short-lived, there's nothing to them. We repeat it over and over and over again, but the thought is over, and then we repeat it over and over again. And when we can begin then in a very, very detailed way, after the mind is liberated in fact, We can begin to see how everything that arises does in fact rot. It dies. And that what we have to do then with 16— by the way, 13 is the Anicca, everything is changing, things arise, they arise, they pass away, they fall apart. The word that's used in the sutta is cessation. That things just stop. And this is one of the ways that I talk about it from the sense of keep your mouth shut, learn to stop, learn to be quiet, let things rest, because then we can practice Step 16, which would be in the mini sutta's translation uses the word relinquishment. Which we also use as setting things down. Now, in Western Buddhism, it's common to say, "Let things go." Well, you can only let things go when the mind really has done all of these other things that we've talked about for the past 40 minutes, getting the mind liberated. And a liberated mind can let things go. When the mind is not so liberated, it takes work. So it's not letting it go, it's throwing it out. It's giving it the boot. So relinquishment also has that quality of throwing things out, getting rid of it. Ivan, you got your hand up, go ahead.

**Speaker C:** Dhammarato, I asked you, I think a few days ago, about Anicca, I was talking about not getting rid of the unwholesome, just letting it pass or something.

**Speaker A:** And.

**Speaker C:** But yeah, but sometimes I find it beneficial, like you said, to throw them out. So when, I guess this is still a question I'm confused by, I guess, like when do I throw them out, when do I not throw them out?

**Speaker A:** Ah, let us do it this way. Let's do it first the easy way. And that is, can you let it go? Can you just drop it? Can you allow gravity to take over and it just leaves? All we have to do is open our hand, it's gone. But what happens if you open your hand and it's still stuck there? An example of that would be I've got a battery in my hand and now I'm holding it tight and I let it go. Where's the battery? It's still there. You have to do something to actively turn your hand over to throw it out. Okay, this is the quality that we have to practice while we're still practicing. Okay, when we have a mind that's liberated, that means that we're ready to let it go. And so when we do, it palls.

**Speaker C:** Okay, understood.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so there's that two kinds of— instead of letting it go. Now, um, Deidre asked a question long ago about what, boredom, or now what, or is that all there is?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, like if the mind is really quiet and empty then it sneaks up on me like, now what?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay. Is that new thought that came in, if the mind is empty and quiet and everything is— and then the thought comes, now what? Is that a wholesome new thought or is that an unwholesome thought?

**Speaker D:** Unwholesome.

**Speaker A:** Unwholesome. Okay, can you see that unwholesome thought as unwholesome? Now what? And the answer to now what is that, and going back to that statement about is that all there is, yes, that's all there is. Have you investigated it thoroughly? Because that is quite a lot. If that's all there is, sounds like there's not much to it. And the Buddhism we talk about, the word is Sunyata, which means that emptiness. Is that all there is? That's right, that's all there is. Nothing. There's just nothing to it. Now, can we have that idea of nothing to it? Yeah! Wow, there's nothing to it anymore. This is it. Or you can be disappointed. This is all there is.

**Speaker D:** Well, it's not disappointment, it's more— it scares me a little bit.

**Speaker A:** Like, yeah, because you've been taught your whole life that you're something. Teacher, you've been taught your whole life you're a special girl. Yeah, now you're finding out there's nothing there. Oh, can you see that then is liberating? Because when you say there is all— is that all there is? That's not liberating, that's losing something. Is that right?

**Speaker G:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, here's one for you: freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose. What do you think about that? Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose. Because then you're completely free.

**Speaker D:** Unsurpassed.

**Speaker A:** Unsurpassed, exactly. Brightened right up. So if in fact we come to that state— and this, by the way, is something that everybody goes through when they come to that state of nothing— the attitude everybody has right from the get-go is, 'That's all there is?' Yeah, there's nothing to it. But that takes kind of practice. Another way of looking at it is— I remember this well, and I talked to Ajahn Po about it, and he kind of giggled and said, "Yeah, that's right." And that is that when we finally get the mind quiet in the sense of going from the first Jhana into the second Jhana, And we watch just kind of little threads of thought come up, just tiny, almost thoughts. And then even that quiets down and things do become kind of empty at at least the mental level of thinking. And almost always what happens is the meditator who has finally gotten into the second Jhana, what happens? That's the pity. Yippee! I've got it, I've got the mind quiet. Well, guess what happens with that is the mind gets really noisy again, and we've lost that second jhana. So this is actually the, what you would call the path of second jhana, is to touch your toes into it and keep going a little bit further and a little bit further until you get used to the fact that the mind is completely quiet And then you can jump right in. And the complete jumping right in then is more like the third Jhana, to where I've got the mind quiet, but I don't have that yippee quality anymore. It is steady. It's— I'm trying to think of two different words in English and in Pali. Upekkha, okay, that is kind of, I'm feeling really good, but the feelings are not what's happening now, it's the stillness that's happening now. All right, and that in also in the beginning for that, the question is, is that all there is? There's nothing there. Okay, so we kind of dislike it. We have to go through both the "Yippee, I've got it!" and also the "Well, that's all there is." And so we now are dealing with feelings at a very subtle level. And when we can dispense with both the "Yippee!" and the "Is that all there is?" then we can just go into that state of nothing to it, there's nothing there. Anurag, you've had your hand up for quite a while, I think from the last time. Do you have a question?

**Speaker F:** No, sorry, I just forgot to put it down.

**Speaker A:** Oh, okay, all right. So we've actually covered Anapanasati Sutta again from a different perspective. This time we're working on mostly that quality of getting the mind liberated. If it's liberated and empty, like an empty hand, that means that we can relinquish things easily. Now there's another way that we can talk about it, and using the word— you've heard the word grasping and clinging. Another word to use is carrying. Okay, that we care about things. And this is a way of talking about that relinquishment. For most of us, we have to actually actively throw out that which we care about. The things that you care about is what's going to hurt you. For instance, if you care about politics It's going to be painful. You can meditate yourself out of a wet paper bag, you can get yourself into those Jhana states, you can get yourself to completely empty, and if you come back to the television and you start watching stuff and you start caring about it, there's that Dukkha again. It comes back. So we have to then practice when we're out in the world to stop caring about everything that things right now are OK the way that they are. Never mind that Donald Trump is going wild with his tariffs and whatnot. I don't care. Let those guys who are angry at him, let them care and let them deal with him at whatever level they're going to deal with him. I don't care. I'm just watching the show. I'm having fun with it. So, Dietri, you got your hand up.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, so last time we had a one-on-one call, I talked to you about friendship and being like, like caring for people.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker D:** And also like in this perspective, caring for your family, your kids, or your husband or whatever. So it's like, um, right.

**Speaker A:** So can you care about your family without carrying them around? If one of your relatives, you, die on you, are you going to carry that corpse around like, uh, Tathagata?

**Speaker D:** I'd rather not.

**Speaker A:** All right, so what does that mean? You've got to set that thing down, actively set that corpse down. Put it down, relinquish it, don't carry the dead. As Jesus would say, let the dead bury the dead. Let other people in your family worry about and care about the people who died in your family. And it may not even be a death, it may be a pregnant daughter. It may in fact be a gay daughter, which is, I think, in most cultures even worse. Okay, are we going to care about her to the point that we're going to make a stink about it? Are we going to stop carrying other people around? Stop carrying Putin, stop carrying Trump, stop carrying the two Vlads, stop carrying the money, stop carrying all the stuff that you're carrying around, everything that you care about. The car that you have is going to break. You have a responsibility to service it correctly so that it doesn't break because you didn't change the oil, but it is going to break. And as you can imagine, what do most people do? Let's say the motorbike craps out on you right there on the street. What are you going to do? You're going to push it to the station? Isn't that kind of carrying it? Isn't that Dukkha? Well, in our culture, it's a shame to just leave it there, but you could. But if you did, wouldn't you think about it later, saying, "Oh, I should not have abandoned that motorbike because it had a flat tire"? So what I'm talking about now is when you are doing something like pushing a motorbike, don't have the mental attitude that I have to push it. Have the mental attitude of this is just something to work. Let's have fun at it. This is just a toy to play with. Can you have that kind of what we would call unification of mind? Can you be free from that motorbike, even though you're pushing it down the road? And you get tired, what are you going to do if you get tired? Most people are going to trudge and keep pushing. Perhaps the Buddha's way of doing it is, Take the bike off the road and sit down under a tree and enjoy yourself for a while. Rest, take it easy. And then when you're all in a really good state of mind again, go back out to the road, pick up that motorbike, put it on the road, and start pushing it again happily. That's the part that all of us generally miss when I talk about this with students. They misunderstand when we talk about relinquishment. They think that I'm relinquishing a physical thing, but really what we're doing is we're relinquishing a mental state. What we're really relinquishing is that victim's attitude. I'm a victim to this motorbike that won't run.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, now I get you better because you can enjoy friendship or family or enjoy company or whatever. Enjoy whatever is there, enjoy whatever is going on, even if they pass on you or things, people get mad or angry or cars break or whatever.

**Speaker A:** Just enjoy the show. Enjoy the show.

**Speaker D:** That's it.

**Speaker A:** So, Ben, do you have a comment? Good comment. It's lighter when you don't have to carry things. I'm sorry, what was that? I can't hear you, Mikey. What did you say?

**Speaker E:** It's lighter when you don't have to carry things, right?

**Speaker A:** Okay, all right. Anicca, I see you lurking in the corner with your microphone and your camera off. Do you have something to say? How about you, Mike? Michael? Yeah, there you are. Sorry I was late. Thank you, Dhammarato. Is that all? Is that all there is? That's all there is.

**Speaker C:** Nothing.

**Speaker A:** I'm not carrying nothing. How about you, Chris? Have anything to say?

**Speaker C:** Not especially.

**Speaker G:** I do have maybe a quick question. So the words that Deidre was using, I think those are from the Citta section of the Satipatthana, not Anapanasati.

**Speaker A:** Yes, I think I mentioned that.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, and so my question is, I think I have a recollection, I may not be right, but in Arahant's commentary, he equates to unsurpassed with the Jhana. What do you think about that?

**Speaker A:** With the what?

**Speaker G:** The Jhanas.

**Speaker A:** Yes, absolutely. Okay, that when you're in that Jhana, that's an exalted state.

**Speaker G:** But it's Jhana. Have I gotten to the end yet?

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the whole point. Let me explain it like this. The Buddha was extremely clear in many different places, including in Sutta number 36. In the story that's called "The Rose Apple Tree," where the Buddha figures out that the path to liberation is in fact, the First Jhana. You can also see that the Anapanasati Sutta is in fact geared around the First Jhana; it's got all the Jhana factors. Okay, so here's the question for you then. In the time of the Buddha, where they did not have cell phones, they did not generally have writing paper and pens and whatnot like that, and here you are sitting under a tree with literally nothing to do and no place to go other than going deeper into the mind. Isn't that what the monks would generally do? In other words, what we're saying, and the way that the Buddha expressed it, was a pleasant pastime. They're passing their time in a very pleasant state. But the question is not how deep into meditation you go— there's that word deep again— But we're talking about how do you live your life, how do you work around, how— what kind of mental state are you going to be in when you're out on the road pushing that motorbike? You could be in First Jhana, you could be in First Jhana driving a car, but you cannot— and in fact there's a story about that to where two of the Westerners were in a chat about this guy driving down the road and his teacher was the passenger, and he says, "Now I'm in second jhana, now I'm in third jhana, now I'm in fourth jhana," while the teacher was listening to him. And the cop in me says, "Hey, if you do fourth jhana while you're driving down the road, I'm going to D-U-J you." Driving while in jhana is the same thing as driving in a way, in a kind of intoxication. You can't do stuff when you're in those high Jhanas, other than just merely investigate the mind to the point that when you can get to the point where the perception stops, feeling stops. Well, you can do that a bit in first Jhana. You can bring the feeling or bring the perception to a close just by observing, and when you're observing and the perception stops, then your feelings stop and you don't feel anything, that's back to that void. In other words, anything that can be done in those higher Jhanas can be done in the first Jhana, just not sustained. And in fact, what we work on in the first Jhana is to sustain Keeping the mind in wholesome thought, sustaining the mind in a good positive attitude, sustaining the mind in a relaxed body, sustaining the mind in Sukkha, and when we're really, really good at sustaining it in that, Those are the higher Jhanas. The higher Jhanas are not a goal. It's a pleasant abiding that you can do while you already have your freedom. Let me relate that again. This is an important point. The higher Jhanas are not the goal. The goal is first Jhana. Once you have the first Jhana and you've got nothing left to do, then just sit there and let the mind go into these higher states. It's a pleasant abiding, the Buddha calls them. He does not call them the goal; they're merely very pleasant. It's also kind of a skill. And we get a great deal of pleasure by doing that skill. Let us say like this, that you have a pianist. Let me use Van Cliburn. Does anybody know the name Van Cliburn? Van Cliburn, I forgot what year it was, but it was back in the '70s, he won some contest on the piano. And he became, as a student, like the best university student in piano or something like that, world champion piano player, like that. But Van Cliburn was not anywhere near the level of an Arthur Rubinstein. Why? Because Arthur Rubinstein, he learned to play all of the concertos. They've got, in fact, quite a lot of them on YouTube. The reason that I'm mentioning this is because all we need to do is just get to the Van Cliburn level. We don't have to become the full-blown maestro, that the Buddha didn't teach that. It's certainly available to us, but what we really want to practice is liberation, freedom, to have a really good happy life. In other words, get one grand piano piece learned well, and then you can play anything else on the piano, having fun at it. But you don't have to keep practicing and getting up to those high Jhanas. They're not necessary. I know that in fact this talk, this part of the talk that I'm giving right now, would be heresy in many places. This is a heretical thing to say, because they want to say, "Oh no, in order to be fully enlightened, you have to do it the way that Sariputta did. You have to go beyond the fourth Jhana to go into boundless space." boundless consciousness, nothingness, neither perception or non-perception, into the state of that nothingness or the stopping of the perception. You don't need to do that to be happy. You have to remember to be happy. And those higher Jhanas are nothing but A pleasant abiding, a whole lot more pleasant, by the way, than watching a YouTube video of Donald Trump wrecking the American economy. That's not a pleasure. Does that answer your question, Chris?

**Speaker F:** [Speaker:Q] Yeah.

**Speaker A:** In other words, there's not much to it, there's nothing to it. There's nothing to this Jhana. Pardon?

**Speaker G:** So coming back to the original question of the third tetrad, let me check my understanding on this. This is how I think of the third tetrad. This is the point where we're contemplating the mind now. We're no longer in the body or the primitive feelings, but the mind. What are the mental states that tend to carry the day? Which of those are wholesome and which one's unwholesome? Nurture the wholesome ones, squash the unwholesome ones. And this brings— wholesome would be ecstatic, exalted.

**Speaker A:** Unwholesome would be dull, ordinary, the attitude of a victim, the attitude of being under someone else's control. The attitude of, uh, this isn't good enough— those are unwholesome mental states. Wholesome mental states would be, wow, I've got this.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, and if you can squash those, then you're no longer frazzled and with these twisted views, and it brings liberation from the stress you were experiencing from those wrong views. Those are the four steps.

**Speaker A:** That's what makes the teachings of the Buddha so possible for anyone who will actually practice. That is not, let us say, didn't somebody write a book about hardcore Did Dan— who wrote that book about hardcore Buddhism or practice? How about deep meditation? These are concepts that have snuck into Buddhism in the West, about that it's hard. It's difficult, but that's just an unwholesome attitude. The wholesome attitude is, wow, this is really nice, this is easy, there's nothing to it. In the sense of, instead of asking the question, is that all there is? He said, "Is that all there is?" So this is what we mean then by a wholesome attitude. One last point, I know that we're going over the outer hour. The Kansambi Sutra, number 48, talks about that attitude in the sense that the student knows that no matter how obstructed hindrances the mind gets, he can get it out. That's that positive attitude: I can come out of these hindrances and see things the way that they really are. But he knows that, not in the sense of a one-time shot, but he knows because he's done it so many times that he is not a victim to his mental hindrances anymore. He can, in fact, as soon as he sees that hindrance, as soon as he sees that obstruction, he says, "I can get out of this." And by saying that, he's changed his attitude, and he has in fact come out of it. The Buddha says that this is the first step of the noble that this is the first step of the path. So in some regards, you could say that one who has that attitude of, 'I can get my mind straightened out no matter how obstructed it is.' So let us say that we walk out of the Department of Vehicles or something like that, fuming, and as we walk out, we can say, 'Wait a minute, I don't have to feel like this.' and we can change the attitude, and by the time we get to the car, we're happy again, we're skipping. Yay, I can be okay. Even though I didn't get the license that I came here for, I can still be okay. This is that quality of the first Jhana that we're looking for right from the very beginning of the path, and that is that I can remember that I can come out of this. The same thing would be true if you're— let us say that you're angry. The question is, and in fact, a good question about this is that, when you're angry, most people when they're angry, they don't know they're angry. They can be confronted with it, and they still say, "No, I'm not angry." They'll say it in a way of, "Screw you, I'm not angry!" When in fact it's clear. That they are, but they don't admit it. Because why? Because they're not supposed to be angry. They've got that rule. There's where they're attached to the rule instead of looking at it. And the right way to do it, when you say, oh, well, you're angry, you say, yeah, there's Anagami there, I could see that. And I can come right out of it because now I can see it. Well, hopefully you don't have to be confronted with your anger, you can just see it. Go ahead, Chris.

**Speaker G:** So just hypothetically, suppose you were trying to establish a footprint on Facebook with a group that you're trying to ramp up. What do you do with all the angry snowflake whiny victims of their identities? You just ignore them?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, just ignore them.

**Speaker G:** That's all you can do, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's all you could do anyway. You're not going to fix them. You'd treat them the same way that you would treat anybody that's angry in the grocery store. An example of that is a middle-aged or elderly woman walks into the grocery store in California trying to buy a six-pack of beer and they want to card her. You gotta prove that you're 18. Look at me, isn't that proof enough? Is the way that she would think. But she'd get angry at that. How dare you want my ID, especially if I don't have it? Why should I have to carry an ID? I'm talking about a 60-year-old, 70-year-old woman needing to show her ID. The answer to that is, don't have it, here's your beer, and off she trots happily, remembering that next time, if she wants to buy a 6-pack of beer, in fact, she can say, I'm glad that guy wanted my ID, now I don't have to drink this beer.

**Speaker G:** Or actually, what the 70-year-old wise woman would do, is leave the big warehouse grocery store that's under-employing. Their level of help is pretty low with all these rules. She'd just go next door to the grocery store and get her beer. And you would just leave Facebook. You don't participate in all that.

**Speaker A:** So what— I did that, by the way, with Reddit. I haven't been on Reddit in 5 years. It might be a wonderful place, but I haven't been there. I left it 5 years ago because this is just a bunch of crap, especially the Buddhist groups.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, right. And now we're starting another one.

**Speaker A:** All right, so that's how you deal with it, by not dealing with it at all. Now you can imagine that when that woman is there in that grocery store, that some people are going to be for her and others are going to be against her. 'How dare you want to buy beer without having your card?' And somebody else says, 'How dare you confront an old lady?' And everybody's got an attitude, and the next thing you know, while she's sneaking out of the grocery store happily, you've got a fistfight going on in her behalf, which is exactly what happens on Reddit or on Facebook. People have opinions. Can we in fact live our lives happily while we have to deal in a way with people who have opinions? That's basically what we talked about yesterday, in fact, is how to deal with people. The answer to that is don't. You just walk away. Or in Facebook. In fact, if you find the people who are complaining on a website that you're dealing with— for instance, Dean is taking over our Facebook— I imagine that in that regard he can control who's on there and delete those things. And in fact, that's what we've done on the YouTube is occasionally, very, very occasionally— most of the comments that we get are absolutely happy, spot-on, congratulations, bunches of hearts and that— but occasionally we get somebody on who wants to fight, wants to contradict what's said. What do we do with them? We delete them. We delete that comment. If somebody does— I haven't ever had this. In fact, I did a long time ago where I actually banned one or two people from the group because their stuff was unwholesome. So, Dean, I give you permission. If somebody's on your group, the Open Sangha, and they're complaining about something just delete it. If you're on somebody else's and people are complaining, don't answer it. Does that answer your question, Chris?

**Speaker G:** But it's so fun. I see you, Mara.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I see you, Mara. I see you. You don't have to get stuck into it.

**Speaker G:** You're wrong. Let me tell you how you're wrong.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and in fact, if you'll only read what I have to say, you too will become enlightened. Guess what? When they read it, they'll hate it and complain all the more. Let's not do that.

**Speaker G:** It just escalates.

**Speaker A:** So let's leave it alone. All right, so Gary, did you get your question answered?

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, I think so, Dhammarato. I think so.

**Speaker C:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** All right, Deidre, you had that question. Did we cover it well enough?

**Speaker D:** Well enough, Dhammarato. Fully content.

**Speaker A:** How about you, Amrit? Do you have any closing remarks?

**Speaker F:** No, no remarks. Thanks, thanks a lot, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** All right, how about you, Ben? No, no, everything's good. All right, how about you, Michael? Swift now.

**Speaker F:** Now?

**Speaker A:** Now, good to see everybody, thank you Dhammarato. All right, let's see who else is behind this banner here. Is that Emily? You have anything to say Emily?

**Speaker D:** Hi.

**Speaker H:** Thank you everyone, this was a really fun call. I really appreciate all the great reminders about the practice, like that caring does not mean that you have to carry those things around, and that a lot of thoughts that we have which might seem like obvious, and then you see that that is also unwholesome, like the thought of that there is boredom, or now what, and we might forget that this is also unwholesome, and I really appreciate this great discussion.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. Ah, so, Mikey, can you help me with what she said?

**Speaker C:** I think Amit has to close his microphone, because like the echo, I can't really hear.

**Speaker A:** Mikey?

**Speaker E:** Yes, some of that came through for me, but most of it was unclear. It sounded like she was just kind of going over the talk and saying thank you for the wholesome reminders. And yeah, we don't have to carry the unwholesome. We can just throw it out.

**Speaker A:** Great. Okay, Mikey, so let's finish this off. Let's land this plane. Okay, just flushed his toilet.

**Speaker E:** Glad to see so many smiling friends today. Thank you all for being here, and go play with opensanghafoundation.org. Yeah, we've been putting some more work into it, really having a whole lot of fun with it. Uh, go check out the videos, transcriptions. Uh, Christopher has been doing some really, uh, great work with the transcriptions lately, and we've started to link those to the YouTube videos as well.

**Speaker A:** So yeah, be sure to go to the transcription, click on the transcriptions. That's an important point. Yeah, we're getting a lot of the— some of them are quite old, old videos were getting transcribed and put onto the website.

**Speaker E:** And there's also some cool summaries written with those transcriptions as well. So If you need some reminders about the practice, that's a worthwhile resource. So yeah, go check that out. But yeah, thank you everyone, and thank you for this Sangha call. Really enjoyed it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, very good. Thank you all for coming. Excellent questions today. Thank you, Gary. I hope to see you again soon.

**Speaker B:** Dhammarato, just one thing. Just one thing. If I want to talk to you.

**Speaker A:** One-On-One, do I— hang on, just call.

**Speaker B:** Do I, do I have— do I now under the new dispensation.

**Speaker A:** Need to go to the oldest one-on-one? Just call. Just call. Okay, if I'm around, I'll answer. I'll tell you, call in 10 minutes. Or, and if I'm not there, then hours will go by, and then I'll say I wasn't there.

**Speaker B:** I thought we were booking in advance nowadays.

**Speaker A:** No, we're not. Well, new people, I would like that, to have a bit of warning in advance, especially— basically, here's what's going on. For the old students, if you call, if I'm in the bedroom, I'll just answer you from the cell phone. But if I want to record the call, then I got to get up and come out here, use the walker and crawl out here with broken legs and get to the desk and so that we can record the call. But I'm beginning, even with new students, I'm beginning just to take the call on the cell phone because I'm not concerned. You see, in the old days, uh, we used to have a plan. We had a concept. Every day we put out a video. Now we don't care anymore. We've already gotten 2,000 videos, and so we're doing what, Mikey? About, uh, one every other day now.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, about one every other day.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and so I'm not nearly concerned about getting them recorded anymore. I've gotten old.

**Speaker B:** Join the club.

**Speaker A:** I've lowered my standards. My Sila is not Bhikkhuni, Paramasati anymore.

**Speaker B:** Great.

**Speaker A:** So just call.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, thank you all, guys. I really appreciate it. This has been a great call. We've had quite a few people on it, 13 or so. So we'll see you later. Thank you all. Bye-bye.

**Speaker C:** Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

**Speaker B:** Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye everybody, thank you. Bye-bye, bye-bye.


### Summary

Here is a summary of the Dhamma talk with Dhammarato and Sangha friends:

**Core Topic:** The third tetrad (*Cittānupassanā*) of the Ānāpānasati Sutta, focusing on contemplating and gladdening the mind to achieve liberation.

### Key Points:

1.  **The Nature of *Citta* (Mind/Heart):** *Citta* refers to the core feeling/attitudinal state of mind, distinct from thinking (*dhammānupassanā*). It's our foundational mood or stance (e.g., bright, dull, exalted, victimized).
2.  **The "Victim" vs. "Top Dog" Mindstate:** A central theme is shifting from an ordinary, "victim" mindstate—feeling controlled by external forces, duties, and DNA-level instincts—to a "top dog" or "champion" mindstate of freedom, control, and positive attitude.
3.  **Process of the Third Tetrad:**
    *   **Step 9 (Investigation):** First, investigate the current state of the mind. Is it constricted/narrow or expansive/broad? Is it dull or exalted? This awareness is key.
    *   **Step 10 (Gladdening):** Actively gladden and brighten the mind, cultivating a wholesome, positive attitude. This is not just positive self-talk but a fundamental shift in mental posture.
    *   **Step 11 (Unifying/Concentrating):** Often mistranslated as "concentration," this step is better understood as **unification**. Like mixing cake ingredients, it's about bringing together the relaxed body, joyful feelings (*pīti/sukha*), and gladdened mind into a harmonious, collected whole.
    *   **Step 12 (Liberating):** The fruit of the process: liberating the unified mind from clinging, dependency, and the "victim" attitude. This is *mokkha*—freedom **from** suffering, not just freedom *to* do things.
4.  **Interdependence with Other Tetrads:** The talk emphasizes that the four tetrads (body, feelings, mind, dhammas) are interconnected. A gladdened mind (*citta*) influences feelings (*vedanā*), and a relaxed body (*kāya*) supports mental unification.
5.  **Practical Application & Attitude Shift:**
    *   The practice is about gaining freedom from internal disharmony and the compulsion to "carry" burdens (worries, opinions, identities).
    *   **Relinquishment:** Letting go is easy for a liberated mind. For a mind still training, it may require actively "throwing out" unwholesome states.
    *   **Living from Jhana:** The goal is not necessarily the "deepest" jhanas, but mastering the **first jhana**—a sustained, joyful, unified mindstate that can be maintained in daily life. This allows one to "enjoy the show" of life without being burdened by it.
    *   The attitude is paramount: replacing "This is hard work" with "This is pleasant, I can do this."
6.  **Answering "Now what?":** When the mind becomes very quiet and empty, a common unwholesome thought arises: "Is that all there is?" or "Now what?" Recognizing this as an unwholesome doubt is part of the path. The liberating perspective is to see this emptiness as freedom—"nothing left to lose."

**Conclusion:** The talk frames the Buddha's path as accessible and positive. By investigating and skillfully gladdening the mind, we unify our experience and liberate ourselves from the victim mentality, achieving a happy, unburdened freedom in the present moment.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain the concepts of mind states, meditation, and liberation. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors:**

1.  **Top Dog vs. Underdog (or Victim):** This is the central metaphor for mind states.
    *   **Ordinary/Victim State (Underdog):** Feeling dependent, controlled by external authorities (destiny, society, feelings), having thoughts like "this is hard," "I'll try (with an intention of failure)." It's described as being on your back with paws in the air, with a bigger animal on top.
    *   **Liberated/Champion State (Top Dog):** A bright, exalted, unsurpassed state of mind. The opposite of the victim. It's the mindset of a winner, free from being controlled.

2.  **Cake/Biscuit Baking:** Used to explain **Samadhi (unification/concentration)** and **liberation**.
    *   **Ingredients (Flour, Eggs, etc.):** Represent the disparate elements of mind and experience (body, feelings, mind states, thoughts).
    *   **Mixing/Unifying:** The process of bringing all these elements together into a cohesive whole (cake dough or biscuit dough). This is **Samadhi**—unifying the mind.
    *   **Baking/Finished Product:** The final, liberated state (**Moksha**). The cake is a new, unified entity where you can't easily separate the original ingredients. The mind is free and transformed.

3.  **Carrying vs. Relinquishing:**
    *   **Carrying:** Metaphor for **clinging, grasping, and caring** in a burdensome way. Examples: carrying a corpse, pushing a broken motorbike with a victim attitude, being weighed down by political opinions or family worries.
    *   **Relinquishing/Letting Go/Throwing Out:** Actively setting down mental burdens. If something sticks (like a battery in your hand), you must actively "throw it out." A liberated mind can simply "let it go" like opening an empty hand.

4.  **Freedom TO vs. Freedom FROM:**
    *   **Freedom TO:** Like a teenager wanting the car keys to travel. Still dependent on an object (the car).
    *   **Freedom FROM:** The goal of Buddha's teaching. Freedom from dissatisfaction (Dukkha), from being controlled by DNA/instincts, from societal pressures. "Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose."

5.  **Musician Analogy (Van Cliburn vs. Arthur Rubinstein):** Used to demystify the **Jhanas** (deep meditative states).
    *   **First Jhana (Van Cliburn level):** The essential, attainable goal—a happy, skillful, liberated life.
    *   **Higher Jhanas (Rubinstein maestro level):** Pleasant abidings and advanced skills, but **not necessary** for liberation. They are "pleasant pastimes," not the ultimate goal.

### **Stories & Anecdotes:**

1.  **Grandmother Making Biscuits:** A specific, tactile story to illustrate the "unification" process of bringing separate ingredients (flour, water) together into one dough (unified mind).

2.  **Pushing the Broken Motorbike:** A story to illustrate attitude in daily life. The unwholesome way is to trudge resentfully (victim state). The wholesome way is to enjoy the activity, rest when tired, and continue happily—relinquishing the mental burden even while doing the physical task.

3.  **The "Is that all there is?" Moment:** A common experience in deep meditation when the mind becomes very quiet or empty. The initial reaction can be fear or disappointment ("That's all there is?"), which is an unwholesome thought. The liberated perspective sees it as freedom ("There's nothing to it!").

4.  **Driver in Jhana:** A cautionary anecdote about a student claiming to enter deep Jhanas while driving. Used to argue that the profound, dissociative states of higher Jhanas aren't practical or safe for daily life, reinforcing that **First Jhana** (a sustained wholesome attitude) is the key for living well.

5.  **The Angry Shopper & Facebook/Reddit Drama:** Modern anecdotes to illustrate dealing with unwholesome mental states in others. The wise response is to **disengage, ignore, or walk away** (like leaving a grocery store argument or deleting inflammatory comments), rather than getting caught in the "fight." This applies the practice to social media and interpersonal conflict.

6.  **Wat Suan Mokkh's Name:** A brief etymological story explaining the name of the famous Thai monastery ("The Garden of Liberation's Royal Power") to underscore that liberation (**Moksha**) is the central point of Buddhist practice.

These metaphors and stories work together to make abstract Buddhist concepts (Citta, Samadhi, Vossagga, Jhana) practical, relatable, and applicable to modern life.
