### Transcript


**Speaker A:** There we go.

**Speaker B:** Does it say recording?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's recording.

**Speaker B:** Does it show it here? All right, so anyway, uh, we're actually continuing on from where we left off last time. And the kind of the question is, how can we actually learn to play with this, uh, let us say, this teaching from the Buddha, rather than trying to understand it intellectually or put it into a concept? All right.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So, uh, the first thing that we can understand about it That's just the point, which was the point that I was making last time. But let's make sure that we reinforce that is that the Five Aggregates are first off the kind of the sum total of who you are with the body, the feelings, consciousness, perception, and the memory system. Okay. That's the first thing is that's about all there is. The second point is that there is no inherent self or unity. There's no soul within any of those things. And yet we are taught in our society, especially in religion, that there is something there that is permanent, everlasting, defines who you are. In a way, you could say that it's all in the genes, to where we in fact know that that's not the truth, that sometimes genes get turned on and off, that there's some kind of genes that do things, and then there's other kinds of genes which are boss genes that turn things on and off. So in that regard, that means then that we are not inherently something that stays something. That's the important thing. When you've got that, when you recognize there is no self there inherently within those, then the question is, well, where does the self come from? Okay, so a way of talking about that then also is that A car, an automobile, has the facility of transportation, and yet the quality of transportation is not in the lug nuts, it's not in the tire, it's not in the steering wheel. There is no inherent transportation ability in the back seat itself. If you take that back seat out of the car and put it on the ground and sit on that back seat, you're not going to go anywhere. Okay. When we understand it like that, then we can say, oh, putting that stuff together then is where the self comes from. That you can say that not only is it a certain kind of function of the five aggregates, but it is a function that needs tweaking, it needs repair. It's not that in fact we do not want the five aggregates to produce a cell. It's almost like saying, yes, a car does have transportation, but it also has exhaust. Wouldn't it be nice if we had a car that does have private transportation but does not have exhaust?

**Speaker A:** So we have to find a way to, yeah, condition, use all these elements to condition us, um, in a way that we don't have the What we don't have the self, or is it in a way that we don't have the attachments?

**Speaker B:** Okay, so let us say then, then one of the ways of speaking is, is that when these five aggregates come together, they touch, they contact, and that contact, that putting together, is where feelings arise. In that case, this is where Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about it, that this is where we need to spend our time and attention. Attention is at feelings. Okay, that's the important one. So we can talk about feelings in that regard, in the sense that ignorantly we don't have any control over whether we feel good or feel bad, but wisely we can choose whether we feel good or feel bad. And so you could say then that that ignorant or that delusional— well, that's just how it is. Right. Or many expressions like that. One is the fruit doesn't fall far from the tree. A leopard can't change its spots. That's just how things are. Boys will be boys. Okay. There's a lot of that, but it's heavy-duty reinforced in some religions like Christianity in the sense of original sin. Not only can you not change, you're broken. You're broken and will stay broken, and you need fixing. But God's not going to fix you until you're dead. And he better fix you because you're, in this case, not worth putting into heaven. Right. Interesting thing about heaven they talk about, you know, heaven is where all the Christians go. Well, the Christians that I know that are in South Carolina and in the southern part of the United States. I don't want to go to South Carolina to be around Christians. Why should I want to go to heaven and be around them there? So that's the whole idea then, is that they've got an idea of permanency and they can't be fixed. But we're understanding that no, everything is fluid and that we can change. And this is what the teaching of Paticcasamuppada is all about, is to find those places where we can start to make some changes.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Oh, okay. Yeah, I kind of see what you mean.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. All right. Now, we can say that many of the changes that can be made have the quality of being late. In being ordinary. But as we progress, we're going to be able to do that so that we can change that stuff very quickly in a noble way. But we got to start with the slow, hard way. And so here, let me give you an example of that. Two people are, let us say, in an argument wherever they are. They may be in a bar, they may be in a funeral home, but they're arguing. Right. When does the argument stop?

**Speaker A:** When they leave each other, probably.

**Speaker B:** Pardon?

**Speaker A:** When they leave, when one of them decided to go away.

**Speaker B:** Right. So, and that may be death. I decide to die on you because you just stuck a knife in me. Okay, that's pretty late in the argument, isn't it? Yeah, that means nobody woke up. So somebody woke up to say, I want out of here, this is Dukkha. And so they left. Okay, in some arguments, in fact, what happens is that the leaving, the exit, has also a door slam. That will slam the door on the way out. Okay, that's an important point about that, that we recognize that things have gone too far. Okay, so now we're on a roll because we have actually gone from— in Piti to Samuppada is that we're recognizing that this, this Tanha and this Upadana has caused us to go into a woeful state, and this is misery. We want out of it. OK, so if we wake up a little bit sooner, we can recognize then that all this is just merely Tanha. I don't have to go all the way into Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** And so what we begin to do then is we begin to rest at feelings. This is the watch point. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about it in the sense of, number one, getting the mind fit for work. And then he talks about it as wisdom at the point of contact. Wisdom at the point of contact means that we actually have a choice about how we feel about things. If we have wisdom at the point of contact, or if we are a little bit late, we can see the feelings that we have and change them. That this is the place that we're going to start working now is at the point of feelings, Vedana, which is, by the way, halfway in. And if you look at it from the sense of the feelings plus Dukkha, plus the original ignorance that we've talked about, and while we've got Second Noble Truth, the Paticcasamuppada is nothing but an exposition of the Second Noble Truth of what is the cause of suffering. Is our ignorance and our feelings.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay.

**Speaker B:** And so the Five Aggregates— where did the feelings come from, right? And so here's where we're left now, is with, okay, we're going to start watching how we feel and then figure out how we got there. Now, this is a fairly advanced way, uh, along the practice, this already takes some skills. Okay, so the skills that we need to develop for this is to be able to catch the kind of thoughts that we have so that we can gladden the mind and make ourselves feel good. We need to actually understand that we do have a mechanism so that we can feel the way that we want to feel, rather than feeling haphazardly according to the old habit patterns of the mind. That you actually can choose how you want to feel, and that is basically by talking yourself into it. In fact, on these video calls, of these thousand video calls, that's what I spend most of my time doing, is talking the student into feeling good. Recognizing that if I can talk them into feeling good, they can talk themselves into feeling good also.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I noticed that the good feeling I get from other people or other circumstances, it's just me putting the good feeling authorization on this thing, and when I get it I'm like, okay, now I can feel good. But it was always mine.

**Speaker B:** Like, you're always your choice. That's what we're developing. We're developing the understand. The first understanding is I've got a choice. And the second one is, is that, yes, I have a choice and it really is my choice and I can make it. Okay. So it's both the possibility of success and the guarantee of success. The possibility is I can change. And then the other part is, darn tootin', I can. Yes, we can change. Yes, let's do it. I have changed. So this is actually then right effort is the change and the Samma Sanghappa or the attitude that I can change because we're practicing over and over and over again to change the way we feel. Because we're in the habit of feeling in a certain way, now we're going to develop a new habit of feeling really good.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay.

**Speaker B:** In other words, we're going to start taking control over the feelings, and we do this in what we refer to as seclusion. In other words, we don't have very heavy weights draining down on us, just the natural bad feelings all by themselves is where we're going to start. We're going to make things as easy as possible by not having, let us say, the right place to practice Anapanasati for the beginner is not standing in front of a firing squad or being wrestled to the ground by the cops or being hauled into court. Those are all heavy-duty things. We want to get away from all the heavy stuff so that we can do it and start to develop it so that we know that we can do this. Then later, when the heavy comes, we can draw on that tap that, yes, I can make myself feel good. I can do it in this tough situation also. And so we begin to practice that and we begin to fail at it as we're practicing, as we begin to wake up to what's really going on. Many times in the beginning, we don't like it. Yeah, but we develop also the quality of, yes, I can like it, even though I used to not like what used to cause my trouble. Now I want to be friends with that which caused my trouble, because only by seeing it correctly can we together avoid the trouble. This is all going back to the point about feelings, that if you recognize you have a choice about how you feel, All right, so let's give an example of that. The example is that, uh, the husband sees mother and daughter having a big fight, an argument with each other, and he does not like them arguing. So he storms in the room and starts yelling at him for arguing. In other words, he joins the fight. Guess what? Neither one of them want him in there fighting with them. They'd rather have their own argument by themselves, thank you very much. And he's made things a lot worse because he did not like them fighting. Okay, but if he is wise, he can say, wait a minute, I can choose the way that I feel, that I don't have to hate that they're arguing. What I can do instead is enjoy the point that I don't have to interfere. I've learned my lesson, and I know now not to go into that catfight, because if you go into a catfight, you're going to get scratched. So don't go into a catfight. And we— and so we can, we can congratulate ourselves and be proud. Well, I don't have to go into that. Yeah, now I can just sit here and enjoy the show. Okay, so that means now that we have actually taken control of the way that we feel. Before, we really hated what was going on. Now we can feel okay about what's going on because we know that we can't do anything that's going to improve the situation, that all we can do is just enjoy the situation. And then you might make a statement, something like, 'Arahant, you two are really funny like that, a couple of cats fighting,' to try to wake them up. But we always do that with humor rather than anger. But can you get yourself into a state of humor about two people fighting?

**Speaker A:** That's the effort.

**Speaker B:** That's the right effort. And the way that we develop that right effort is by going into seclusion and recognizing the fights that we got on in our own mind and say, "Aha, I see you two fighting again." And so, this is the way that we practice. This is why seclusion is so important, is so that we can get in there and start changing the way that we feel. So that then we all have a choice about how we feel when the going gets tough. And the going gets tough means that we've gotten ourselves in the possibility of going into a state of not liking. I don't like this. Okay, and the answer is, well, that's still my choice, and I can like that I don't have to not like it. Okay, yeah, I can actually— I could feel really pleased. Wow, you guys used to just get me all uptight when you fought. Now I'm okay with it. Yeah, fight on. Okay, I hope you're enjoying your fight as much as I am.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's a nice way to go around it. Sometimes I feel effort when I try to— for example, usually it's like a feeling that I don't like. And so I try to like it. I try to tell myself, okay, it's okay, I like this feeling. But it's not always quick. Sometimes it's a lot of effort, and then the effort creates even more hard feeling. And then I try to be like, okay, I can just enjoy these bad feelings. And sometimes it gets a little bit nicer and then it goes back. It's always like a kind of like a fight, but where I try not to fight.

**Speaker B:** Right. So what we're actually beginning to do here, this wisdom at the point of contact, means that we're actually rebroadcasting or revisiting the actual scene in the sense of what we invented in our mind. So when they were fighting and I didn't like it, now I can go back in my mind about their fighting. So what? In other words, I could begin to change my attitude. And the issue is, is that It's not that they're fighting and I don't like it. It's that they're fighting and I can choose how I want to feel about it. We can begin to change that. That's that relationship between the sabbeyatana and the contact and the feelings. So in that area, we can change the way that we feel, that we do not have to act ignorantly. This is the place of starting paying attention. This is the excellent place. Why is that excellent? Well, it's excellent because we are already not in Dukkha trying to crawl out of it. We have just caught it in the nick of time before we got into it. That's the latest time that we can catch it without actually having to step into it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, at least we're not We maybe we're not feeling good, but at least we're not in the fight.

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** Joining the— yeah.

**Speaker B:** So in that regard, we can say that we can see the distinctions now between Vedana and Upadana. There's a distinction between I am pleased by it and I like it, as opposed to I want it. You see, that was an ignorant step that we made. Just because I like it doesn't mean I have to want it. Or in the case of the two people arguing, I don't like it, but that doesn't mean that I want to change it. I want to fix it. I see it broken. I want to fix it. Right. So we can see that. We can begin to see I like it, I want it. Or I don't like it, it's my job to fix it. Those are two different things.

**Speaker A:** But how do you do this with the feelings? Because I understand that with the situations, maybe like family members fighting, but sometimes with the feelings, there is a want to fix them because we're trying to change them, right? To the wholesome. So sometimes when we get bad feelings, I mean, when I get that feeling, I try to change it, maybe. And there is some attachment there because I'm attached to the— Yeah, right.

**Speaker B:** Here's the ignorance too. The ignorance is their fight makes me feel bad. Guess what? Their fighting doesn't make me feel bad. I have chosen ignorantly to feel bad because they're fighting. That in fact, some people could be standing watching the fight that they're having, betting money on it. They're really enjoying the fight, right? So maybe that's the way that you could do it. You can start saying, oh well, I'm going to bet $5 on Mama, she'll win this argument. Get them to start thinking about that they're in a prize fight or something. OK, so in any case, the story is that Ajahn Chah asked Ajahn Samadhi a question when they were at a big ceremony that had a lot of Thai young ladies all dressed to the nines. And Ajahn Chah asked Ajahn Samadhi, what do you think about all of this? And Ajahn Samadhi's answer was, I like it. But I don't want it. I like it, but I don't want it. Okay, so this is where we can say then wisdom at the point of contact. And we like it, but it's wise now, and we don't have to let our liking go into lust. I want it. We could just leave it at the state of I like it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right. You can also do the point about the feelings with 'I don't like it.' Just because I don't like it doesn't mean that I've got to go fix it. I don't like it, but I'm not going to fix it. Okay. There's also a stage which can be very valuable and useful for some people in the sense of 'I like it and I want it.' but I can't have it. I'm not going to get what I want. Can I be comfortable and happy even if I don't get what I want? Because if I can be comfortable and happy when I don't get what I want, then maybe I could stop wanting it because I'm already satisfied without it. So these are the things that we play with at an ordinary level. Okay, that I can not like it, but that I like that I don't have to do anything about it. So this is this point of— now we're working at Vipassana, Vedana, Tanha, and Upadana, which is a much better place to work. Than after we're already in it, from the woeful state, trying to climb back out of it. It's better to not go in it, to recognize that I like it and therefore I want it. There's another step that happens, and that is: I like it, I want it, I need it, it's good for me, therefore it is inherently good. I don't like it. I want to get rid of it. It's bad for me, therefore it's inherently bad. In fact, it's downright evil. Okay, so good and evil at a very high philosophical level, that way up there where the religions are— good and evil is not defined as something actually good or actually something evil, but it's defined by, I don't like it, therefore it's evil, and I like it, therefore it's good. So this is where our feelings come from. They are not where they come from, but that's where they can go, goes into judgments. Then, in fact, eating of the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil was what got Adam and Eve tossed out of their— what was it, a cemetery? No, it was paradise. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right, so how did they get thrown out of their paradise? Because they started judging their paradise. Oh, this is a nice paradise here, except that this piece of paradise's tree's got a yellow leaf, and I don't like yellow leaves, so I'm going to pick off every yellow leaf I find in my paradise. How many leaves will be left if I pull all of them off one at a time when they go yellow, right? Maybe we won't be in paradise anymore. We'll be in a, uh, a sea of dead trees. That's what we do when we judge. So let us go back then to the feeling. In other words, instead of having thoughts like, it is bad for those two family members to argue, we can stay with I don't like it and leave it there and start dealing with the feelings right then and there. I don't like it, rather than jumping to some rule like that's bad for them to fight.

**Speaker A:** I have a question because the thing, it's not mostly about like family members fighting or circumstance, even if sometimes it is. But most of the Dukkha I feel actually at the moment is mostly about the feeling itself. Like, maybe I have a bad feeling for some reason but then I don't care about the reason, but I still have the sensation that I don't like very much, like the feeling that I don't like. And so I try to change it, but this trying, I don't know how to explain very well.

**Speaker B:** Are you talking about maybe anxiety or the feeling of tension, pressure?

**Speaker A:** Like, I feel that I'm attached to the feeling itself. And not something like two people fighting, or like the weather is bad or something like this. It's mostly about, I don't feel good, and I try to feel good, and I'm attached to the good feeling because I know it's right practice.

**Speaker B:** Is it possible then that the reason that you don't feel good now is because there's two people inside your own mind that's fighting? And you haven't figured that out yet?

**Speaker A:** Possibly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that may be what's going on, is that the argument or the fight that you're not liking was already inside anyway. So we need to start paying attention to that. This is where it becomes more noble in the sense of what kind of thoughts am I having when my two family members are fighting, or what kind of thoughts am I having in my own fight on the inside that brings up the anxiety. Okay, so anxiety just doesn't happen on its own. Just like a tree that is being cut down, you know, the good forestry people that are good at their job, never mind the moral issue of cutting trees down, but they can guide that tree that they know where it's going to fall because of the way that they're cutting. It leans. Okay. The leaning then, or the angle, is going to determine how that tree falls. That's also true in the mind. It's called attitude. And in engineering, we use the word attitude in the sense of what kind of support systems does it need? In other words, where is it being out of balance or out of gravity, or it's leaning. It's got an attitude, right? And so if it's leaning or has an attitude, like the attitude, for instance, of being a victim to other people— when other people argue, I get really uptight. Okay. But that's because that's my attitude. That's the way that I lean. Therefore, every time I hear two people fighting, I do get uptight and upset. All right, well, guess what happens to very, very little children when Mommy and Daddy is having an argument? That's where we learn that stuff. We learn it. And when I say that, that stuff, that means we learn to feel bad, we learn to feel in danger, we learn to feel uptight. When the environment is noisy, when two people are arguing or whatever. And so we grow up with that same mentality. We repeat the same thing over and over again. Now you have a choice at that point of contact. You can say, wait a minute, I don't have to follow the old feelings from the past that I felt uptight and anxious when Mommy and Daddy were fighting back then. But I don't have to now. I can feel the way that I want to be. This is the waking up process. This is what Sati is all about, or to recognize that these thoughts and feelings are unwholesome. Let's put some wholesome thoughts and feelings in instead. Thoughts like, I can handle this. Okay, so this is exactly why Anapanasati and Paticcasamuppada fit so deeply, closely together, that you can see exactly where Anapanasati practice is actually modified modifying these actual elements that are specified in Paticcasamuppada. And we can change if we remember to change and we know exactly where to tweak. You can feel the way you want to because you're having thoughts to feel the way that you want to. That's the saliattana, that you can make out of this situation what you want to make out of it. You're not bound to make out of it what you've always been making out of it in the past. We can make a change. And the other thing we want to practice is to change the way we feel. Or we can change, um, the— at the point of I like it and I want it, but I could do without it. I don't have to go into I like it, I want it, I need it, I gotta have it. Okay, we could stop We don't have to go all the way there, okay? And we can begin to play with that until the point that we can get it. Okay, I like it and I want it, but I don't need it. Later we can come to I like it but I don't need it, I don't want it. I can like things because I like them by choice without having to go to the point of I have to have it. And that's how we interrupt the process, and you can begin to feel the way you want to feel.

**Speaker A:** So the way I want to feel.

**Speaker B:** There is this— I mean, think about it. How do you want to feel? How would you want to feel if you could feel the way you wanted to feel? How would you feel?

**Speaker A:** I would feel good. Okay, but I think there is the— I want to feel good all the time.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's something that you don't have. The question is— a better question is, can you feel the way you want to feel right now when you think about feeling the way you want to feel? Because you're not going to feel the way you want to feel when you've forgotten all about feeling the way you want to. You're going to be back feeling the way that you're in the habit of feeling.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense.

**Speaker B:** So Sati, let's wake up. Let's remember that we can feel the way that we want to feel, because otherwise we'll feel the way that we used to feel. Yeah, I think to get that thing upright, we begin to get our attitude changed. And the attitude is, I can do this, I can handle this, wow, I can take care of this, that this is not a hindrance for me. I can throw that stuff out.

**Speaker A:** I think it's the attitude, the doubt, because sometimes I guess I have less Sati, that's remembering, So then I get back to feeling like I used to, and it's such a big difference from how I feel when I pay attention and I feel like really good. Then I get the doubt, like I lost it because like a few moments ago I forget and I felt as usual. I mean, I didn't feel that bad, but now that there is this contrast, it feels really like negative compared to the awesomeness of having awesome practice. Then there's this doubt like, oh, I lost it, and then I try to feel good again and I lose the confidence.

**Speaker B:** Right, okay, so recognize that that's the way that it happens and that you can remember again. Remember, keep remembering that you don't have to feel bad. That you can remember that you can feel the way that you want to feel. That's the secret of Paticcasamuppada, that you don't have to feel like you want it or you need it or you got to get rid of it. That, that's what we've been always doing ignorantly, thinking, oh, that if I like it, I have to have it. Oh, if I don't like it, it's bad. Those are delusional thoughts. And the reality of the situation is you can feel the way you want to feel if you remember to feel the way that you want to feel. And so start experimenting. Well, if I could feel the way that I wanted to feel, how would I feel? Then start practicing feeling that way.

**Speaker A:** Okay, it's very simple. It's always the same thing, and I know it, but it's tricky.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it actually is. It's the Dhamma of the Buddha is very, very simple, but it goes against what we've been doing. It goes against our, basically, the flow of greed, ill will, and delusion. That is the world. And you can begin to feel the way that you want to feel and gain the skills to do that if you remember that you can feel the way you want to feel. Hot dog, I can't feel the way that I want to feel. I don't have to feel the way that I'm thinking. I can change the way that I'm thinking and feel the way that I want to think. Or I actually think the way that I that will help put me in the state of feeling the way that I want to feel. And so one of the ways that we feel really good is by feeling successful, feeling satisfied, feeling content, feeling safe and secure. Safe, secure, content, satisfied, and successful. That's the list of stuff that the Buddha gives.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, about the successful part, I think that's the one that for me is a bit lacking, um, because I just like, sometimes I don't feel successful and at this practice because, uh, you know, I forget and then I felt bad for like a few hours or days. And then how, what, um Could we talk a bit more about just the successful part of it? Like, what are your awesome thoughts about it that you like? Maybe some things that I could use to feel even more successful?

**Speaker B:** Well, here's the thing that happens with most people is that when they do remember that they can feel good, they don't like the fact that they have not been feeling good. In other words, we turn around to the past and say, blah, blah, blah, 'Ah, you were bad because I wasn't already feeling good.' And while they're doing that finger-pointing, they're still not feeling good.

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right. So we have to recognize that to be happy that we did remember now, rather than being unhappy that we forgot so long. That's the quality of never mind, start again. I do remember now, let's do it now. Rather than, oh, poor me, I forgot all of those hours. Look how miserable I was all of that time. Guess what? I'm still miserable. I haven't changed it yet.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And by staying miserable, that's just the old habit. We're just going along the same old habit feeling. And now we recognize that we're in a bad habit feeling. And so we say, oh, look, I'm still in that bad habit feeling. This meditation is not working for me because I'm still— but it's not working because you're not practicing the correct meditation. The correct meditation is to remember to stop that stuff, to remember to stop the past and be okay right now. Remember that you can feel right now the way you want to feel, never mind that you weren't before. Now you can.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I got to stop looking back.

**Speaker B:** Right. I can remember. I can. And so we develop that can-do attitude, becoming a lion. The Buddha was known as a lion. Become powerful, become strong, because you can feel the way that you want to feel. You become champion you become the owner of your feeling. Most people, the self, whatever that is, actually takes on and becomes the feeling. It's out of control. So people will say things like, I'm angry, I'm frustrated. Okay, guess what? They're not angry. They're not frustrated. But there is anger. And instead of seeing anger as anger, they see the self as angry. That's the beginning of the self, is that I am angry rather than, oh, I see that anger. Yeah, it's there. So I am angry is very much like this. I am angry as opposed to, aha, I see that anger. I see it. And because I see it, I am not angry, but I see the anger. Or as we're talking about, I see that I like it. I like it, I want it. Aha, I see that. I can see that I like it and therefore I want it. And now I can just rest with, oh, I like it, sure, but I don't want it. Or if I like it and want it, I don't need it. So those are those points that we can do, because if we like it and we want it and we need it, now we're in misery. Now we're in a woeful state. And people wake up out of those woeful states. They don't stay in the woeful state too long. They do wake up out of it. We're going to wake up before we get into it. Yeah, earlier and earlier and earlier and earlier. Can we, can we go from the woeful state back to the clinging and say, I can make that change. Just because I like it and want it doesn't mean that I have to have it. I'll be okay without it. Then we can back up. I like it and I want it, but I don't really want it that much. I just like it. So now we're back into the feelings. Just so that's the backup. That's the way that we can actually see that stuff happening within your own mind. Watch, watch closely now.

**Speaker A:** Okay, yes, it's very helpful.

**Speaker B:** Okay, we'll go practice this. Go practice watching what your mind is doing.

**Speaker A:** I'll do more Anapanasati and less thinking about, about this. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, we'll see you later. All right, very good.

**Speaker A:** This is great. Thank you very much. Thank you. Have a good day.

**Speaker B:** Okay. All right, bye-bye. Bye-bye. Yeah, let's have a good moment. That's all we need.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** Okay, bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** See you. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B), focuses on moving beyond intellectual understanding to **practically "playing with" the Buddha's teaching**, specifically using the framework of the **Five Aggregates** and **Dependent Origination (Paticcasamuppada)** to end suffering.

Here is a summary of the key points:

### Core Teaching: You Have a Choice in How You Feel
The central, practical message is that **we can choose how we feel**. We are not victims of external circumstances or our own habitual reactions. While we ignorantly believe that people or situations "make" us feel a certain way, wisdom reveals that we authorize our own feelings.

### 1. The Foundation: No-Self and the Five Aggregates
*   The **Five Aggregates** (form, feeling, perception, mental formations, consciousness) are the sum total of our experience. There is **no permanent, inherent self or soul** within them.
*   The sense of "self" is a **function** that arises when these aggregates come together, like the "transportation" function of a car's assembled parts. This functional self needs "tweaking and repair."

### 2. The Critical Point of Intervention: Feelings (Vedana)
*   The most important place to apply our attention is at the **aggregate of feeling** (vedana)—the pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral tone that arises from contact.
*   **Dependent Origination** maps out how ignorance leads to suffering: Contact > Feeling > Craving (Tanha) > Clinging (Upadana) > Suffering (Dukkha).
*   The goal is to develop **"wisdom at the point of contact"**—to catch the process at the stage of **feeling**, *before* it blindly escalates into craving and clinging.

### 3. The Practical Method: Changing Your Attitude and Thoughts
*   We change our feelings by **changing our thoughts and attitudes**. If you can feel bad because of a thought, you can feel good by choosing a different thought.
*   This is a skill developed through practice, like **Ānāpānasati (mindfulness of breathing)**, which calms and focuses the mind for this work.
*   **Start in seclusion**: Practice choosing wholesome feelings in calm, simple settings to build the skill. Later, you can apply it in difficult situations.

### 4. Key Insights and Practices for "Playing" with Feelings
*   **Separate "Liking" from "Wanting"**: You can *like* something (e.g., see its appealing quality) without *wanting* or *needing* it. This breaks the chain toward clinging.
*   **Separate "Disliking" from "Fixing"**: You can *dislike* something without feeling compelled to fix it, change it, or judge it as inherently bad. This prevents you from adding your own conflict to a situation (e.g., joining an argument you dislike).
*   **Interrupt the Judgment**: Feelings often lead to judgments of "good" or "evil." Stay with the simple feeling ("I don't like this") instead of jumping to a condemning story.
*   **Address the Inner Fight**: Often, our anxiety or bad feelings are caused by an internal argument or conflicting thoughts. Apply the same wisdom there—see the internal fight and choose not to join it.

### 5. Overcoming Doubt and Forgetting
*   It's natural to forget and fall back into old habitual feelings. The key is **mindfulness (sati)**—**remembering** that you have a choice, *right now*.
*   When you remember, **celebrate the success of remembering**. Don't berate yourself for the time you forgot; that just perpetuates bad feeling.
*   Cultivate a **"can-do," lion-like attitude**: You are the owner of your feelings. Practice thoughts of safety, contentment, satisfaction, and success.

### Conclusion: The Simple but Challenging Path
The Dhamma is simple: **you can feel the way you want to feel if you remember to choose it**. The challenge is that this goes against the lifelong habit of reacting with greed, aversion, and delusion. The practice is to continuously **watch the mind** and play with interrupting the habitual chain at the point of feeling, thereby taking ownership of your inner state and moving toward freedom.

**In essence:** Don't be a passenger on the train of habitual reactions (Contact > Feeling > Craving > Suffering). Become the driver by using mindfulness to stop at the station of **Feeling**, and choose a different destination.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain Buddhist concepts, particularly the Five Aggregates, Dependent Origination (*Paticcasamuppada*), and the practice of working with feelings (*vedanā*).

Here are the key metaphors and stories identified:

---

### **1. The Car Metaphor**
*   **Purpose:** To explain the concept of "no-self" (*anattā*) and the functional, interdependent nature of the Five Aggregates.
*   **Explanation:** A car has the function of transportation, but that function isn't inherent in any single part (lug nuts, tires, steering wheel, back seat). If you take the back seat out and sit on it, you won't go anywhere. Similarly, the sense of a "self" arises from the coming together and functioning of the five aggregates (form, feeling, perception, mental formations, consciousness), not from any permanent soul within them. The metaphor also extends to the idea that this functional "self" needs maintenance and produces "exhaust" (suffering), pointing to the need for skillful conditioning.

### **2. The Family Argument Story**
*   **Purpose:** To illustrate the chain of Dependent Origination and the critical point of intervention at the level of feeling (*vedanā*) and craving (*taṇhā*).
*   **Explanation:** Two family members are arguing. An unwise person (e.g., a husband) dislikes the argument, feels he must fix it, and joins the fight—making things worse and creating his own *dukkha* (suffering). A wise person recognizes they have a choice at the point of **feeling** ("I don't like this"). They can choose not to let that dislike escalate into craving for the argument to stop and clinging to the idea of fixing it. Instead, they can change their relationship to the feeling, perhaps even finding humor in the situation ("enjoy the show"). This story shows how to avoid entering the "woeful state" by applying "wisdom at the point of contact."

### **3. The Tree-Felling Metaphor**
*   **Purpose:** To explain how mental states (like anxiety) don't arise randomly but are directed by our underlying attitudes, just as a tree's fall is directed by the cut.
*   **Explanation:** A skilled forester guides where a tree will fall by the way they cut it; the lean determines the direction. Similarly, our mental "attitude" or habitual leaning (e.g., "I am a victim when people argue") determines how we react to events. This learned leaning comes from past experiences (like a child hearing parents argue). The practice is to recognize this lean and change it.

### **4. The Ajahn Chah & Ajahn Sumedho Anecdote**
*   **Purpose:** To perfectly illustrate the separation between feeling (*vedanā*) and craving/clinging (*taṇhā/upādāna*).
*   **Explanation:** At a ceremony with many beautifully dressed women, Ajahn Chah asks Ajahn Sumedho what he thinks. Ajahn Sumedho replies, **"I like it. But I don't want it."** This succinctly shows the wise stance: one can acknowledge a pleasant feeling without letting it trigger craving and possessive desire. It models "wisdom at the point of contact."

### **5. The Adam and Eve / Paradise Metaphor**
*   **Purpose:** To critique the judgmental mind that creates "good and evil" out of personal preference, leading to suffering.
*   **Explanation:** Adam and Eve were ejected from Paradise for eating from the "tree of the knowledge of good and evil." The speaker reframes this: judging Paradise ("I don't like that yellow leaf") and acting to remove every "imperfect" thing eventually destroys Paradise itself, leaving a "sea of dead trees." This warns against moving from simple feeling ("I don't like this") to absolute judgment ("this is bad/evil and must be removed").

### **6. The "Fight Inside Your Own Mind" Analogy**
*   **Purpose:** To internalize the primary teaching and apply it to inner conflict.
*   **Explanation:** When a student says their *dukkha* is often just a "bad feeling" not linked to an external event, the teacher suggests that perhaps **"two people inside your own mind are fighting."** This reframes anxiety or unease as an internal argument between mental factions. The practice is the same: to observe the internal fight with wisdom, not get drawn into it, and choose the feeling one wants to cultivate.

### **7. The Lion Metaphor**
*   **Purpose:** To encourage confidence, power, and ownership in practice.
*   **Explanation:** The Buddha was known as a lion (*Sīha*). Practitioners should develop a "lion-like" or "champion" attitude, becoming the **"owner of your feeling"** instead of being possessed by them. This contrasts with the common delusion of identifying with a feeling ("I *am* angry") versus mindfully seeing it ("There is anger").

### **Summary of Core Teachings Illustrated:**
These metaphors collectively reinforce a central thesis: **Suffering arises not from feelings themselves, but from our ignorant, habitual reactions to them.** The path is to:
1.  **See the interdependent, selfless nature of experience** (Car metaphor).
2.  **Catch the process at the stage of feeling** (*vedanā*), before it escalates into craving and clinging (Family argument, Ajahn Sumedho story).
3.  **Understand that our reactions are learned leanings/attitudes** that can be re-trained (Tree-felling metaphor).
4.  **Practice in "seclusion"** (with internal conflicts) to build the skill of choosing one's mental state, becoming a confident "owner" of the mind (Internal fight, Lion metaphor).
5.  **Avoid the trap of judgment** that solidifies aversion and desire (Adam and Eve metaphor).
