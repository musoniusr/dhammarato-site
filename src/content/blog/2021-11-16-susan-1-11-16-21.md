### Transcript


**Speaker A:** That way you don't have to take notes.

**Speaker B:** Okay, thank you.

**Speaker A:** All right, so Susan, welcome. You've been telling me that you spent a number of years practicing various things, but when you started practicing according to the actual sutta itself, that things are changing for you. And so I'd like to start off with the introduction of showing you how all of this stuff fits together in a package deal. There are a number of suttas. In fact, we've had a discussion recently of how many suttas can we find that has the famous statement that the Buddha teaches only one thing. He only teaches one thing. Now look how many things are in the teachings of the Buddhist and Western Buddhism. Gosh, there's all kinds of stuff. But in the teaching of the Buddha, there's only one thing, and he teaches, and that is Dukkha. Dukkha, Nirodha. Now we have to understand Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha in the sense of that it is right now Dukkha, and then immediately right now Dukkha, Nirodha. The way that is practiced in the West is Dukkha, Dukkha, Dukkha, give me some Dukkha, I want to look at Dukkha, I got to go deep into Dukkha, I'm going to inspect and get great deep insights out of this Dukkha, and then I'm going to look at some more Dukkha that's associated with that and get to the bottom of this Dukkha hole. That's how it's practiced in the West, almost as if Buddhism was taught in some engineering school or something. And so, they're missing out on that Dukkha-Nirodha part that is part of the path. So, this is the first thing. We can also look at other examples of that one teaching. The one that I like is, "Don't worry, be happy." because that has the immediacy of don't worry right now, be happy right now. To where Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha looks like a journey of 1,000 years or maybe 1,000, 100,000 hours of meditation practice or something, and eventually you'll get some of this, rather than let's do it right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Goenka had a phrase that I can see that's right in there with that. And that phrase is, never mind, start again. Never mind that the mind has wandered away, never mind, but to start again back into freedom. So that's the whole teaching of the Buddha. Now we can look at it unfolding, that, uh, that one teaching into the Four Noble Truths. And the Four Noble Truths, the word Dukkha actually is mistranslated in Western Buddhism, as is so many other words. They think that probably one of the fundamental problems with Western Buddhism is bad translations. And the reason that there are bad translations is because, um, to do a really, really good translation, it takes three skills. You have to really know the language that it's being translated out of. You have to really know the language that you're translating into. And you actually really have to know the subject. The original translations out of Pali into the English were missing two of those ingredients. They didn't know the language and they didn't know what they were translating. And so they had a lot of mistakes that were made. And so the context that they left it in was a Christian context. And so Christianity has huge influences on Western Buddhism that it doesn't have at all. In Asia. And the first one would be— in fact, I could give you a whole long list of words translated wrongly that put things way off in the wrong direction. And one of them we can look at is this word Dukkha, because it's been translated as suffering, as if here we are, each one of us, all on our own cross with nails and ropes and all of that, and there we are stuck and we're suffering. Okay, but the word dukkha doesn't mean that. It means actually just simply dissatisfaction, that we can actually understand it better by noting that it's got an opposite. And the opposite of dukkha is sukha. Now, in the Thai language, dukkha and sukha are opposites, and in the Gujarati language, dukhi and sukhi are opposites. So what that means is, is that Dukkha means is that we're unsatisfied, that there's no pleasure, that things are dry. And Sukkha means that things are pleasurable, that they are nice, that we're satisfied. And in fact, we could go so far as to do that one translation of Dukkha means dissatisfaction and Sukkha means satisfaction. And guess what? Satisfaction is a skill to be developed. According to the Anapanasati Sutta. It's a skill to be developed to bring your mind into a state of comfort, to bring your mind into a state of safety and security, so that you can then help bring the mind into a state of being satisfied, that right now everything is okay, we can be satisfied. Because when you are satisfied, guess what? You're not in Dukkha, you're in Sukkha. Which actually means the Third Noble Truth. Now, one of the ways that Western Buddhism is normally taught is they do their best to ignore the Third Noble Truth. They talk about it, they may chant it a bit, but nobody talks about it in the sense of, hey, there it is, get yourself into it, do it right now, right? It was always planned way off that Dukkha, Nirodha is going to be way off into the future, that you got to suffer first, you got to put in your time, all of that kind of stuff. Well, that's very Western mentality, very Western thought process. Also words like concentration, which is now a major part of the teachings of meditation in the West, where in fact the word concentration comes out of the word Samadhi. But Samadhi doesn't mean concentration at all. What it means, in fact, is gathering all of the factors together. So if you're going to have a particular mental state that is known by these factors, then you need to practice the skill of getting those factors together. So when they do come together as a group, now you have something. I'll use the example of baking the cake. Imagine that you're baking a cake and you've got all the ingredients, and there you are mixing it together, and you look around, where's the sugar? Got no sugar. Okay, well, if we got no sugar, that's okay, we'll make a cake without sugar. And now you have a Mahasi cake. It's dry, it is not delicious, but it's cake. All right, so that's what's happened, is, is that this missing ingredient or two, the sugar has been removed from the teachings of the Buddha by the Westerners, or basically the Asians never bothered so much because they've got all the sugar they need. But in the West, the whole mindset is capitalistic, dry, competition. And so we begin to see meditation that way also. And in fact, that's one of the big, big issues of meditation is the competition. Who can sit the longest? Who can sit up the straightest? And all of this kind of competitive stuff that is part of Western mentality that's got nothing to do with the real teachings of the Buddha. That in fact it would be kind of ridiculous for us to compete and compare with each other over who's the happiest right now. That doesn't make any sense, does it? No, not a bit. You're either happy or you're not happy. The whole teachings of the Buddha have been, let us say, not taken as an actual whole, but they have been taking bits and pieces of Buddhism and plugging it into a Western model, rather than bringing in the whole show. Because the whole show is actually quite simple, if we come to it from the whole show, instead of little bits and drabs and pieces. Points of wisdom seems to be what Buddhism has become in the West. But that's not a bad thing, because people are beginning to wake up. They're just not waking up as fast as they could if they knew what to do, right? So, uh, the whole quality then is to get ourselves into a state of the Third Noble Truth, and that there is a method to do this. That in fact, the Eightfold Noble Path is immediately mistaken, and people make great mistakes with it simply because it's translated as the word path, thinking that you got to go someplace to do something. To where in fact, if you think of it like this, that in order to get into the golden chamber of the mind, all you have to do is to put in the key, turn the lock, turn the handle, and push the door open. And that's all there is to it. But most Westerners think, yeah, I know that's all there is to it, but that door is 10,000 miles from here and I got to take a path to get to the door. All right. Where in fact the door is right here. There's no path to take, but there is the method of turning this, putting in the key, turning the key, turning the handle, and pushing the door open, which is basically Anapanasati. Actually, this is actually the Eightfold Noble Path, um, or the Eightfold Noble Method. But let's look at the putting in the key, the turning the lock, to turning the handle and pushing the door open is actually not 8 points. That's even fewer than 8 points. So let's look at the Eightfold Noble Method, because it's not a path to go someplace, it's a method to change where you are right now. It's like just the difference between standing up and sitting down. You don't have to go anywhere to stand up or to sit down. There you are. And so the Eightfold Noble Path starts off with Right Noble View. Actually, before we talk about the Eightfold Noble Path, I'd like to mention that there are in fact two paths. There is an Eightfold Path And then there is the Eightfold Noble Method. The method is noble, the path is ordinary, done by ordinary people with ordinary minds who come to Buddhism. And when they come, they come and hear it in the sequence of Sila, Samatha, Panna. Have you ever heard of that sequence? Sila, Samatha, Panna?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I've heard those words.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay. Well, that's the ordinary path. That's the way that ordinary people get started on the path, where the Sila that we're talking about can either be good behavior, that you're a little goody-two-shoes for years and years, and then you can practice Samadhi, is the way that a lot of people think about it. But basically, the Sila means that you only need to get in seclusion. If you're not around other people, you're not going to kill any people. If you're not around people, you're you're not going to steal anything from them. If you're not around them, you're not going to abuse them. So getting yourself into seclusion is Sila enough. And then the next one is the Samadhi. A lot of people think that's concentration, but no, really what Samadhi here means, it means to gather the factors together that we need. So that then, another way of talking about that is purification of the mind. And then the third one would be purification of view, which would be the wisdom part. Okay, it has been historically taught that way, except that the transition from the ordinary noble— excuse me, the ordinary wisdom— to convert that into noble wisdom is the place where everybody is missing it. They don't have that changeover. And so Achan Po, the abbot of Wat Soan Nok, has asked me to— let's not do the normal one-two punch of Buddhist teaching it like this until people are ready, and then we'll teach them this. Let's jump right into the supermundane immediately. Let's go right to the noble automatically and not do it in regard of the ordinary path, because people can practice the ordinary ordinary path their whole lives and not get anywhere. Or maybe they practice their whole life not getting anywhere, thinking that they will have a rebirth or a rebirth into the next life, and then they'll practice that whole life without getting anywhere. And so basically what part of the Noble Eightfold Path is, is coming out of magical thinking and coming into the reality that only I can solve my internal mental problem. Now, our whole society is built upon the premise that you need help. Christianity teaches that you need a Jesus or something. You don't have a plastic Jesus riding on the dashboard of your— on your truck, you're messed up, right? You've gotta— you gotta have something, right? And in our society, you've got to have money, you've got to have wealth, you've got to have prestige, you've got to have a title, you've got to have this, that, and the other thing to be okay. And yet so many people have all those things and they still don't feel okay. So that's the ordinary way that we're looking for it, is to get something, to gain something, to gain help. I need help to get out of my mess. So I need a brick bat, or I need a dagger, or I need a textbook, or I need a Dharma book, or I need something to get out. And that this is the ordinary mindset. And you could say that this is actually one of the levels of doubt, the first level of doubt. The first level of doubt is, who can I get to clean up this mess? Imagine that you walked into the house, you open the door, and the whole room is a wreck. Everything that was in that room is still in that room, it's just all over helter-skelter. What's the first thought that we have? Something like, what happened here? Or, who made this mess? Right? Because we want somebody else to clean it up. We want it back the way that it was, but we don't want to take the effort to do it. So that's the first level of doubt, is who can we get to solve our problem? Can I get a doctor? How about a guru? Maybe a teacher, a priest, anybody, a lawyer, you know. So you can see all of these professions that have built up over time in our society that fulfills the role of the— for the individual who cannot help themselves. In this, we can't do that. An example would be that when a student is learning to play the piano, the piano teacher can listen to what the piano student is doing, and she can watch his fingers, she can notice what this and that, and changes his behavior and whatnot. Well, we can change, we can observe behavior in a person, but nobody knows what's going on in anyone else's mind. Nobody knows what anybody else is thinking. All we know is their behavior. But if you've got a whole a room full of meditation students and everybody's sitting there as still as they can, you don't know who's thinking what. All you can do is you can kind of guess that there's a whole lot of commotion going on, but everybody is trying to hide that commotion. And so with this, we have to come to the second kind of doubt, which is in fact the Second Noble Truth. The Second Noble Truth itself has an underlying important teaching in it that almost nobody ever recognizes. The Mahayanas have gone so far as to take it down to just one word, as if a car can operate with just one tire. And what is that one word they have? They say that the cause of suffering is clinging. Okay, but that's not at all what the Buddha taught. The Buddha taught it as there is greed, ill will, and delusion. Now, this delusion that we're talking about is real delusion. It is not ignorance. There are two kinds of ignorance. There is wise ignorance and there is foolish ignorance, which would be the delusion. So we're not talking about simply just don't knowing. Because you can be wisely not knowing. In fact, if you don't know something and you want to know it, you could Google it or you could go get the information. But if you think you already know the answer, you're not going to bother to get the real information. You're going to continue with whatever you believed, or how wrong that might be. And so this is the real issue of the Second Noble Truth, is we think we know when in fact we don't, and we don't bother to check it out. So this is where Anapanasati comes in, is we need to do some investigation to find out what's right and what's real or not. But there's more important underlying teaching in that, and that is the actual cause of dissatisfaction is something that each individual does for themselves. Each person causes themselves dissatisfaction when they want things they don't have. Each individual causes their own dissatisfaction. Doesn't come from the sky, doesn't come from the tsunami. There's no such thing as an act of God to make me feel bad. I choose to do that ignorantly. This means that the Second Noble Truth is really all about personal responsibility. Going back to that first issue of the doubt of who can I get to fix my wagon, the answer is ain't nobody going to fix your wagon. You got two choices: you can either get in and ride it broken Or you can fix it, or you can walk away from it. Those are the three choices, actually. But most people want that fourth choice: maybe I can get somebody else to fix my wagon. And our whole society is built upon that delusion. So, the Second Noble Truth is teaching us that we have to do it ourselves. So, that leaves us a second level of doubt. That second level of doubt is, well, if it's up to me, am I up to the task? That is the major issue. That, in fact, is— am I up to the task is the issue that every student has to deal with. And if they deal with it in a practice to where they don't get the results that they're looking for, then they keep coming up with the conclusion of that doubt. That I'm not up to it. I can't fix myself. I can't get anybody else to do it, and I can't fix it myself. That particular kind of position is kind of a deep despair when we recognize that I'm stopped. I can't get anybody else to do it, and I can't do it myself. I'm out of here. I'm dead, right? This is what you could refer to as the dark night of the soul, but that's only because the students are practicing incorrectly. If they are practicing correctly, then they begin to build confidence that they can in fact do this. And so let's go now from the Second to the Third Noble Truth in recognizing that any time that you are free from greed, free from ill will, free from delusion, then you're free. That the Third Noble State is some— not some magical state that's way off into the future. You have been in that state probably 10 or a million times, 10,000 or a million times in your lifetime, but you didn't notice it. That we tend to only notice things when it hurts. Um, I've got a— I've got a power supply that's got an exposure to it, and whenever that power— whenever that wire touches the skin If the power is not there, I don't notice it at all. It doesn't feel anything. But if that power is on it and then it gives a little tingle of the shock, I don't like that. Okay. What I'm getting at is, is that we tend to remember the things that we don't like and we tend to forget about the things that we do like because it doesn't mean anything. If I like it, then it doesn't mean anything. If I don't like it now, I've got to do something about it. It may be dangerous, it may be deadly. And so we tend to remember throughout our whole lives all the bad stuff that happened to us, and we don't remember much of all of the good stuff that happened. Now we're going to start paying close attention to all the good stuff that not only is happening surreptitiously, but it's also the things that we're directly creating. And this is the third noble truth, is to be able to say, yes, everything is okay, everything is fine, I really am satisfied, I am not in a state of Dukkha. Now the Western mentality is saying, wait a minute, I don't want an ordinary okayness, I want something special. Do you hear what I just said? I want something special. That's the problem, because they feel unsatisfied. I want something special I don't have right now. And so that's the state of Dukkha. If you can get yourself into a state of satisfaction, it doesn't matter how small the satisfaction is. Satisfaction is dissatisfaction, and we want to use it as a seed and get it to grow. But if we're saying, 'I've got joy, but it's not enough joy,' that's just being more Dukkha. That's been being dissatisfied, rather than, 'Yeah, I've got a little bit of joy, and that's great.' Now that's being satisfied with it. So this is the change of attitude that brings about that Third Noble Truth is really an attitude change. And so let's look at the Eightfold Noble Method for a moment and break it into groups that the Buddha, in fact, when he introduced it in detail, he says, listen carefully and I will teach you about right organization of mind with its supports. And features. Okay, which means now that we have three. We have right unification of mind with its supports, the things that are going to support it and bring it up, and the features that are going to be there once you have, uh, the right unification of mind. Now, we're not talking about right unification of mind that is permanent, that somebody has no unification of mind for years and years and years and then they step on a nail or their teacher hits with a thin stick or something like that, and poof, when they wake up and now everything is new and the mind now is organized. That's not how it is at all. Then in fact, sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't, sometimes you're okay and sometimes you're not. And we're going to start working with sometimes you are okay and sometimes you're not. We're not going to continue to dwell on the not and start dwelling on the okayness of it. Now, this right unification of mind, the noble unification of mind, is often referred to as concentration, right noble concentration. That's a huge mistake, because if in fact somebody did have right noble concentration, they wouldn't even go around in their life. They just have to sit someplace in Samadhi for the 12 hours, 16 hours a day. You may even have to sit up sleeping if you're going to work on concentration. But that's not the teaching of the Buddha. The Buddha did not teach concentration. He taught Samadhi, and Samadhi means organization. So a very quick way is imagine that you've got an alarm clock, maybe an old-fashioned alarm clock, but it's been to the jeweler, and the jeweler has cleaned every gear, he has oiled it, he has put it back together correctly, and it is functioning correctly. That clock then, with all of its parts and pieces and component pieces together, would be Samadhi. It's working. Now the Westerner wants to make that clock concentrated. The only way to do that is take a sledgehammer to that alarm clock. Now we can get it down to a smaller package, but it's not going to function correctly if it's concentrated. All right, so now we have to understand that the Buddha is not teaching about a concentrated mind. He's talking about an organized mind. How is the mind organized? Well, it's going to be organized with four features that are on the Eightfold Noble List of items. And when we practice these four items, then the right unification of mind comes about automatically. With those four features. Once the mind is automatically in, or once the mind is in a state of Samadhi, or in a state of correct organization and functioning correctly, that means that we don't want anything, that we're good, we're satisfied. If we don't want anything, then you're very unlikely to kill anyone to get what we want. If we don't want anything, we're unlikely to steal anything. If we don't want anything, then in fact we want— we're secluded now, not just from other people, but we're secluded from wanting. And because we're secluded from wanting, our Sila now winds up being perfect because the mind is noble. At any one particular time when a child is in the shop and about to see— about to, uh, to shoplift something, and then they see that the clerk is watching them or something like that, and they have a wake-up moment That's the moment of Samadhi. This is dangerous. I should not do that. I don't want this item that bad. And they take their hand off of it. They don't take it. They don't steal it. OK, that would be a Samatha moment. The mind was organized well enough to prevent themselves from doing something wrong. And we want to try to cultivate that mentality so that we feel the mind is organized. We don't want anything, which means that now we're very unlikely to harm someone. So that's the path then. So let's go back and look at the supports or the requisites for the right organization of mind. The first item on the list is right noble view. This is wisdom. Remember before we talked about Sila, Samatha, Panna? Well, the Noble Path starts with Panna and it winds up in Sila. Yeah, okay. So here, Panna Samatha Sila is the actual Noble Path, to where the ordinary path is Sila Panna or Sila Samatha Panna. That's the ordinary path. The Noble Path starts with wisdom. Now, what the word— uh, when we start with wisdom, when we start with Right Noble View, basically you called me. That's an indication that you had right noble view. Let's get this stuff straightened out. Let's fix this. Okay, so that's the right noble view from the beginning. But we need to develop that right noble view over and over and over and over again. And also, the right noble view is not about what we think is right or wrong. That would be holding a viewpoint or having a concept or a belief. Well, the word, uh, Ditti, uh, Samma Arya Ditti, or Right Noble View, basically is not a view at all. It's a viewing, it's an investigating, it's a verb, not a noun. It's not a Nirodha Noble View that we hold, it's the fact that we are looking, we're investigating, we're noticing. We are paying attention to it. This is what right noble view is. But wrong view and ordinary right view are actually viewpoints. An example of wrong view would be, in fact, the number one motto word of wrong view is, I can get away with it. No matter what, I can get away with it. I can kill 500 cows on this side of the river, across the river, and kill 500 more cows on this side of the river, and it doesn't mean anything. Now, that's looking at it from a very nihilistic point of view, uh, and it's not taking into consideration that the owners of those cows may have something to say or do about killing them, right? But it's only from the perspective of, if I can get away with it because there's no big authority figure out there who's going to crush me for doing all the bad actions. So this is the world of the Mafia, the drive-by shooting, all of that kind of stuff, or shoplifting, harsh language, telling dirty jokes, malicious gossip. In fact, the U.S. tends to be very excellent at malicious gossip. Talking about a third person in order to put them down. Oh, he's a bad person. You and me are okay, but that person's a bad person. So that kind of language, then, when the mind is noble, we don't engage in that kind of language because we don't want anything. We don't have to put anyone down or any of this. Okay, so, um, basically, one's right view or investigation only happens at a certain time. When does it happen? It happens whenever you remember to look, whenever you remember to investigate. If you don't remember to do it, you don't do it. So this is where Sati comes in, is this is the waking up. Now, in English, the word Sati has been translated into mindfulness. The word mindfulness, I don't even know what it means. I never heard the word mindfulness before until it had anything to do with Buddhism. And that's not what the word means. The word Sati means to wake up and take a look. The word mindfulness has some other quality in the sense of mind your P's and Q's, or maybe you're supposed to actually pay attention. Let us say you're a watchmaker and you've got to actually watch what you're doing when you're making that watch. That would be a kind of mindfulness, okay? Where Sati would be for the watchmaker to be aware of how he feels while he's making that watch. So this is the distinction between mindfulness as practiced in the West, that mindfulness is about an activity, to where Sati has to do with looking at what the mind is doing, to wake up to see what the mind is doing. And so in fact, we could use that expression to wake up and smell the coffee. I like that one because the wake up is the Sati and the smelling the coffee is actually an in-breath as well as olfactory in the sense that you're in the senses right now. To wake up and smell the coffee means to come out of your dreams and be in reality. So this is what we are practicing with Sati, is to wake up so that we could do the investigation. And sometimes we can wake up and do the investigation, say, wow, isn't that nice, everything is cool, not a thought in the world, everything is hunky-dory, everything is easy peasy. But often we wake up and we recognize that the thought that we have in the mind is unwholesome. It's not an easy thought, it's a job to do or a problem to solve or Basically, it can be a feeling of disease that we want to get rid of, and we're thinking about what we can do to get rid of this feeling of disease. Yeah, except that the thought of looking for a cure is what causes the feeling of disease, the wandering around searching for something rather than sitting down and saying, let me look at this feeling of disease. And see if I can breathe into it, relax, and just enjoy the moment and let that dis-ease subside. Now, this dis-ease that we're talking about is also referred to as anxiety, low-grade fear, stress, a feeling of insecurity, a feeling of needing to get something done, and all of this. And normally those things come from little thoughts that we have And we do a thought and a feel. Then we have another thought and another feel. And sometimes the thought is, oh, you ought to go brush your teeth, or you ought to go take a bath, or you ought to go get your license, or you want to go meditate. And that you ought to go do something then is met with the internal representation of, no, I don't want to. I don't want to go meditate right now. I don't want to go get the license. I don't want to do it. I don't want to. And now we're feeling bad. Because we've ordered ourselves around and now we're being rebellious against it. We'll go into the details of that in a little while, but the important point right now is to recognize that we create our own misery with our thoughts. And these thoughts that we're creating are actually unwholesome thoughts. And that what we're going to start practicing is having wholesome thoughts. To remember to investigate, check out what kind of thought we have, and to change it from an unwholesome thought into a wholesome thought, and to feel good about it. Because that's in fact what we're doing. Uh, one of the ways of saying it is, is that we have been, uh, talking ourselves into feeling bad for our whole lives. Now it's time to start talking yourself into feeling good. We have been taught to feel bad by all of the adults around us when we were little kids. Everybody goes around feeling bad, teaching the kids how to feel bad. Do your homework, pick up your books, do your ABCs, put down the cell phone and clean your room. You know, all of that kind of language that we learned as kids. And so we've learned that kind of authoritative pushing us around, telling us what to do. And then we repeat it in our own mind. You ought to do this. You ought to go on a diet. You ought to go buy some clothes. You ought to do this. You ought to go get a job. You ought to, ought to, ought to, ought to. You should, should, should, should. This could be referred to as the parent ego state, or the superego in Freud's language. But it's the language that we learned from adults when we were kids. And now we're repeating that stuff without checking it out. We just brought it in as kids without doing any discernment at all. But now we're going to start looking at that language with discernment to check, is that thought worth having right now? And so, uh, the example is the student is sitting watching YouTube and he has the thought, you ought to be meditating right now. And then the thought after that, or the feeling after that, is, oh, I don't want to, I don't want to meditate, I want to watch the video. And then the next thought, you ought to be meditating right now. And the guy says, oh, I don't want to meditate, I want to watch the video. Well, guess what? He's not watching the video. He's caught in this dialogue between does he want to meditate or not, right? The right answer to that would— when you say, oh, you ought to be meditating right now, the answer to that is Yeah, good advice. But we don't do it like that. We resist, we rebel, and we feel guilty and all of this. And so we wind up in a dialogue within that is uncomfortable. It's not a satisfying relationship. So you go do this. No, I don't want to. You go do this. No, I don't want to. 'Oh, write that email.' 'No, I don't want to.' All right. And so having now the thought of, 'Never mind, I don't have to do that right now,' and but we're doing that happily, and we're doing it not out of the feeling states, but we're doing it out of our wisdom, out of the adult, the real boss that we don't use very much. That in fact, what Anapanasati is really all about is putting the frontal cortex, our wisdom mind, in gear intentionally by having wholesome thoughts. And so by having one wholesome thought after another, after another, after another, we begin to gain confidence. The confidence in the Pali, the word is shraddha, or Saddha. Actually, in Sanskrit it's shraddha, and in Pali it's Saddha. And what that means is not faith. It's translated wrongly as the word faith. And some people get really stuck on that word faith. Now, the word faith has to do with the fact that you need to believe this in order to get some sort of external benefit, but you have absolutely no evidence that it's true. Okay, but confidence has to do with mounting evidence. Yep, this is what we're really looking for, is the mounting of the evidence. Now, the first part of the evidence can be logical, or it can be friendship, in the sense that part of my job is to give people the confidence that they can practice and get it done. But the real confidence is going to come from within. The more successful you are, the more the confidence is growing. But we have to take the right effort to change what's unwholesome into wholesome. So now we've got the package together, right? Sati, to remember, to do a right view, to really investigate, look what's going on, make a discernment. Is this wholesome or what? And then we take the right effort to change it to the wholesome. And once we can do that and we know that we can do it, comes the confidence. This is the last piece of the puzzle, the Samma Sanghappa, or one's right attitude. Because we were raised from childhood being a victim. Every little tender infant is completely a victim. If you throw that baby in the trash dump, it's just not going to pop out and go to town, right? We're completely dependent when we were born, and we recognize that. That when we're 2 years old, we can barely stand. Everybody else is walking around, they're yelling at us, and we're feeling afraid. When we have to go out, they hold our hand. The furniture is too big, and everything points to the fact that we're a victim, that we are out of control, that we have— we're not the boss here. And so every little child then is trying to regain, or to gain, that sense of well-being, but they're coming to it from the perspective of being a victim. That one in fact can say that the whole The point of a human being growing up is to come out of their childhood victim state, being dependent upon others, into being completely mentally on his own. That they've grown up, they're now no longer a victim, now they're the winner. This winning is actually the confidence that we're talking about, the Samma Sanghappa. That goes along with the practice of Anapanasati. So when you recognize that the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path have actually is a method, and we're going to apply that method with Anapanasati, that Buddha only taught one practice, that is Anapanasati, but it's a complete practice. So you can say, well, if Anapanasati is a complete practice, then any kind of practices that have piece is gone is all we could think of. It would be Anapanasati almost. Or you could say that, no, if a missing ingredient is missing, it's not going to be the same thing. If you leave sugar out of a cake, it's not going to be a cake, it's going to be something else. If you leave the engine out of your car, it's not going to be transportation. And so, uh, there's a lot of pieces missing in a lot of different practices of meditation. But when we put all of the pieces back together, that's where we have Anapanasati. Now, Anapanasati is actually arranged according to the Satipatthana, because in the old, old times, not just in India but Greece had this also, that there were four primary elements. You had solid or earth, You had liquid or water, you had air or gas, and then you had fire. These are the four primary elements for the ancients. Now we've got more than 92 of them, but all of those, those four elements still are quite appropriate in the sense that— but the Buddha made a different thing instead of looking at it on the outside of water on the outside and air on the outside, etc. Because that was the practice of meditation in the time of the Buddha, was external objects. And they still do it— crystal gazing, looking at a bowl of water like Nostradamus, fire gazing, fire meditation, Vipassana, looking at a distance, stargazing. All of this kind of stuff is very, very old and still done. What the Buddha did that was so remarkable is he took that stuff and turned it from the outside put it on the inside. Let's look at the four elements that we have on the inside. We have the body, we have the emotions, we have the mind itself, which is kind of a furnace, and then we have the smoke that comes out of the smokestack of the mind that we can call thoughts. Thoughts are like the clouds in the air, like the smoke in the air after a fire, and the fire is the mind itself. That in fact even Ajahn Thanissaro has written a book, Mind Like Fire Unbound, that's the name of his book. When the fire is let go, then it becomes a mind. Mind is fire. And so, in the practice of Anapanasati, we're going to practice all four foundations of mindfulness, and in fact, we practice Anapanasati for the fulfillment of the Satipatthana, or the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. And we practice the Four Foundations of Mindfulness for the fulfillment of that Eightfold Noble Path. But when it is fulfilled, the completion of it is called the Seven Factors of Awakening, or the Seven Factors of Enlightenment. In Nepali, it's the Sambhojana. So we practice the path, but when we develop those skills of the path, The completed skills now are the Seven Factors of Enlightenment. So the Sati becomes unremitting Sati, and the investigation becomes unremitting investigation, and the right effort becomes actually unremitting energetic. That were actually in the beginning, it was a lot of work, but now it's easy peasy because we've practiced and we've got the skill up. And so, the next item on the list of the Seven Factors of Enlightenment is unremitting Piti-Sukkha. Well, there's that word Sukkha again. Unremitting joy and pleasure. The next one on the list is unremitting peacefulness or calmness, which is in fact also the step 4 of Anapanasati. So if we're practicing to relax the body, then we are, through the practice of the mental states, relaxing the mind. The body relaxes also. So this is a whole lot to do with relaxation, rest, peace, easy peasy. And yet you'll find in Western Buddhism meditation practice of how long can you sit? At least sit long enough to get into pain. Well, if you're pain, that's not comfortable. And they say, well, just look at the pain. Well, that's not the practice of the Buddha, to look at the pain. That in fact, what we can say is pain is going to come on its own enough, there's no reason to create it. There's no reason to do it directly that we want to impact. Let us say, When we were children, we played, and the playing was a skill development time for things when we were adults. And the only difference is, is that when we're children, things are not important, and when we're adults, things are important. But for kids, nothing is important. They can just play. Okay, another way of looking at it is that any skill that you develop has a beginning, a middle, and an end to In the beginning, you want to make it as easy as possible to develop that skill. Once we have that skill developed, then we want to try to test it. There's going to be Dukkha enough to do the testing. And an example of that, Bhikkhuni said, he said, when one is ill, when the body is sick, that's a really good opportunity to practice. But if you don't have the skills of Anapanasati, then that then it's going to be really hard to practice while we're sick. When we're sick, we naturally feel miserable and we talk ourselves into how bad we feel. Okay, so we need to start off in a way to make it very, very easy for ourselves. So we want to get away from it all, get into seclusion, and practice. It's also like going to the gym for the first time. You don't go to the other end of the gym and pick up a 100-kilo dumbbell your first day in the place. No, you start off simple. So this is the way that we want to practice, is getting it simple. Then we develop the skills, and then later we can use those skills when we need them most. And so that's where Sati is. In fact, I talked to the students about it like this, is that Sati needs to be— it's like Murphy's Law. Have you ever heard of Murphy's Law? Anything that can go wrong will go wrong. And then the last part of it is, and it will go wrong at the worst possible moment. Okay, so we could change that into, um, anything that I can forget, I will forget, and I'll forget it at the time I need it the most. So that's Sati. We know to develop the skill of Sati so that when we need it the most we can remember it and it will be there. And so we need to practice it over and over and over and over again so that it's going to be there just when we need it most. And so the place to practice Sati is the in-breath, to make sure that it's a long, deep in-breath, and to practice Sati on the out-breath to make sure that it's a long, deep out-breath. Relaxing, deep, easygoing breathing. We want to maintain that because the normal breathing is conservative, and it also has the quality of freezing in the sense that if we have a negative or a dangerous thought, it will affect our breathing, that we will shut down. And so we don't generally breathe very well, but if we can remember to take a deep breath and we can take a deep breath. But it takes a little bit of effort to do that in the beginning. But then after a while, it becomes really easy to think about a deep breath. And yeah, it feels so good. All right, so Anapanasati then practices the Sambojana— excuse me, the Satipatthana, the Four Foundations for the Seven Factors of Enlightenment. We would practice the Seven Factors of Enlightenment Or the final goal, if there is a final goal, would be knowledge and deliverance. That in fact is not a final goal, it's more of the outcome. It's not a goal to have, it's just the outcome of correct practice. And knowledge and deliverance, uh, can be— we can bring the Eastern— excuse me, the Western word enlightenment in here because it's got some value. The Buddha did not talk about enlightenment. In fact, the word enlightenment comes from the French Revolution and a war between science and the Catholic Church, uh, a whole lot of big heavy-duty stuff that was going on. But for some reason, the word enlightenment has gotten stuck on the Buddhist teaching. So let's look at it. The word enlightenment, the key word is like. Well, daylight, turning on the lights, let's put some light on the subject. That means the knowledge or the wisdom that comes from the investigation. That we can, when we look and we look early and we look carefully and we continue to look, we can begin to see really what's going on. And when we see what's going on, basically what we're seeing is the baggage. We're seeing the junk, and so we're going to take that baggage. Once we see it, we're going to throw it out. That's the deliverance part, that we're going to become not heavy anymore. We're going to become lightweight. Things are not heavy. We're in fact going back from the time when we were— going back to the time when we were children, where things were not important and that we could play. And in fact, one of the major mistakes— sorry, I can go ahead, I got you, I'm watching.

**Speaker B:** Okay, just want to make sure it's running low on battery. Thanks.

**Speaker A:** All right, so as, as we continue the practice, we begin to change the mind state into wholesome thoughts, one after another after another. When we change those thoughts by gladdening the mind, we change the way that we feel. When we change the way that we feel, we come into a state of satisfaction, we come into a state of feeling secure, we feel comfortable. And when we know that we can do this, now we gain the attitude of 'I can do it.' This is the Sukkha, and now we're adding Piti. The Piti is actually the winner's attitude. It's the change of lineage or the change of attitude from being a victim into being a champion. The Buddha was known as a lion. He was known as a bull. He was known as someone who was supremely confident. And this is what we're looking for instead of being angry at him because he's confident or jealous of him because he's confident. Confident. He's inviting us, you can be confident too, because you could look at what you're doing, you could look at what you're going through, and you can drop that baggage. This is the whole point, dropping the baggage. So a really important way of looking at Buddhism is that there is nothing to be attained. This is always 100% a dead loss. This is an emptying out. It is not a gaining. There are no attainments. And yet the Western mentality is all about goals and attainments. And so some people want to be Srotapanna, they want to be, uh, uh, first Jhana, they want, uh, to be Nibbana, they want this, that, and the other thing. And wanting something is Dukkha. Wanting something that you don't have is unsatisfying. And this is the major problem with the Western mentality, is that they're practicing meditation to get something, to where in fact what we're really doing is we're practicing Anapanasati in order to get rid of the junk, get rid of the baggage. This is housecleaning. To clean the place out, to get rid of the junk. And we do that not in a great big way, but in just a little way. Just this thought, just this one, and retrain the mind with this thought. An example would be, imagine that you've got a weed that you want to remove, but this weed is stuck in the sidewalk, or in, let us say, coming out of the pavement. Anagami, Arahant, and that because the city doesn't want you to dig up the pavement, we can't do anything about that weed that's growing out. We can't get down to the root of it. But what we can do, every time that the weed comes up, throws up a shoot, we can whack it off at the surface. Pretty soon, if we keep whacking that weed off over and over and over again, it's going to get weaker. It's not going to be putting up so many shoots, and eventually the root will die, and we never had to pull the tree up or never had to pull the thing up at all. But the Westerners are there with their shovels and their picks and they're trying to dig up the pavement to get that root out, rather than, no, we're not going to do it that way, we're just going to whack that thing off. Every thought that comes up, we're going to remember to see that thing and just say, no, I'm going to have a wholesome happy thought right now. And this is the whole practice, because that practice of changing the mind is going to bring about a feeling of of safety, security, and satisfaction, which is exactly opposite of the Dukkha. And when we know that we can do this, that brings in the Samma Sanghappa, and now we're practicing the Eightfold Noble Method correctly. And when we do that, we gather together the factors for the mind to make the mind Samatha. What is that number one item on the list? Removal of these unwholesome thoughts, the hindrances. Have to be out of the mind. That's the number one first job. No other job is important other than that. But that one job, even though we have to do it many times over and over again, it takes only about a tenth of a second to do that job. Why? Because as soon as we see that thought, the next thought is going to be, aha, I see you. And now we're out of it. But if we're not paying attention, that thought will stay and stay and ruminate and run and run and run. And then we say, aha, I see you. And as soon as we see it, it's like, aha, I see you, and become right out of it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So, uh, we practice this over and over and over again to get the mind cleaned out. And when we do that and gladden the mind, the other factors come into play. The next one is the Sukkha. After that, doing it over and over again, the Piti arise. There is another feature, and that is that we're actually, by the Sati, we're applying the mind into wholesome, and the job is to learn to sustain the mind into the wholesome. So we apply Sustain the mind with Sukkha and with Piti and with removal of the hindrances. And those are the 5 factors that are First Jhana. Anyone can pass in and out of First Jhana. Everyone passes in and out of First Jhana on a regular basis. So when somebody says, oh, I attained First Jhana, they don't know what they're talking about. What's the point? You're just bragging about something you don't even know. But there are times when we are in that. Now, there's an additional point to it that is in the Suttas, and that is when the mind is applied and sustained and we feel good and we feel confident, also the body relaxes. Why does the body relax? Because we don't have any anxiety, the body is not uptight, it's not tense anymore. So all of this has to do then with losing tension, losing anxiety. There's nothing to be gained. There's no bliss in there anywhere other than what you can manufacture because you know how to do it, that you are the boss of your own mind. But no one has ever been taught that they are the boss of their own mind. They are taught that in fact whoever is in the room who is an authority, they're the boss of your mind. Like the television is often the boss of people's minds, or the principal at the high school, or the teacher in the room, or maybe the IRS. But we're always having some authority figure that's telling us how to think. And this is one of the reasons why we want to get into seclusion, is so we can start listening to the fact that all of this stuff that I tell myself to do I learned it from the authorities that who I am is nothing but a repetition of all the lies and the malicious gossip I've been told. That's who I am. And when I pull that stuff out, then I'm now a blank slate again. I'm nothing in particular anymore. Well, one of the things that the authorities are telling us a lot is what is important and what's not important. And so we go along to get along, and we believe that things are important when in fact they're not. A little example of that: a little girl about 4 years old has been playing with Barbie dolls, but she got them in Thailand. They're knockoff. They only cost about 20 or 30 baht, which is about a dollar. And she loves to take the clothes off. She pulls the arms off. She's really investigating this doll. And so her aunt buys her a real Barbie doll with all of the outfits, cost about $60, $70. She gives that to the little kid. What does the kid do with this new Barbie doll? She pulls the hair off, she takes clothes off, she pulls the arms off, and the aunt freaks out. What are you doing? That doll cost me $60, and here you are destroying it. What is she teaching that child? She's teaching the child importance. Where the child was merely playing. Okay, so one of the things that we're going to be doing here is to recognize that a lot of the stuff that we thought was important is in fact not important at all. An example of that is what happens in a particular capital city between the politicians in that capital city really don't affect your life very much until you think about it. Then you can get really all hot and bothered and champion and go do this, that, and the other thing to get your way, because you feel bad because of the thoughts about what's happening someplace else. But the reality is that what's happening right here in front of you is okay. It's not dangerous. The room you're in is not dangerous. Right here, right now is okay. Why do we not just allow ourselves to feel okay when things are okay? Why do have to think about what some authority figure told us to think about. We can have the thoughts we want to have, and if we have the thoughts that we want to have, naturally we're going to have very wholesome, happy thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So when I tell students they can feel the way that they want to feel— how would you feel if you could feel the way that you wanted to feel rather than feeling the way that you're supposed to feel?

**Speaker B:** How do you feel? Yeah, relaxed, happy.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, relaxed and happy.

**Speaker B:** Chilled out.

**Speaker A:** Right, chill. I like that word. That's the word that in Nepali is Nibbana. It just means to just chill out. The word was used by the people of the Buddhist time in reference to domesticated animals. Like, for instance, the dogs that are barking and fighting with each other are hot, but the dogs that are laying on the floor like this one, they're chill, they're cool, they're Nibbana. Another way that the word was used was when food comes out of the fire, it's too hot to eat, it needs to cool off, or Nibbana, before it's eaten. Okay, so these are the two ways that it was originally used. And the Buddha says, hot dog, I know what— how to use that word. Word because in English we have that same word. It means to kill. Chill, baby, chill. Cool off. Okay, calm down. We tell ourselves that in our language, but when we hear the word Nibbana, we got to make it super, super special, way up there, some high word, rather than, no, I can Nibbana anytime. Just forget all about it and just let it be easy. So this is the basic practice. And that it is possible for anyone with practice to remove those hindrances from the mind. We can do that. You do it on a regular basis anyway. Now we're going to intentionally do it, to intentionally watch what kind of thoughts we have, which means that we're going to be developing two different kinds of skills now. The rudimentary skills of the Eightfold Noble Path or the Eightfold Noble Method when applied to Anapanasati, bring on a new skill. And that new skill is the ease of getting into this state. This is how easy it is. How quickly can we get ourselves in the state of Sukkha, get ourselves into a state of satisfaction? And then the second skill is how long can we maintain that? So basically we're looking at the skill of applying the mind and the skill of sustaining the mind. And when we apply it to these skillful things and we sustain it, then those are the major skills that we need to be able to maintain the first Jhana. Now, first Jhana does not mean thoughtless. It means wholesome thoughts. That we're not ready for no thought at all, but we don't even need to get ourselves to that. But we do need to get the mind that if we can apply it to the wholesome and sustain it to the wholesome, then this is what Bhikkhu Buddhadasa calls a mind that's fit for work. A mind that's fit for work. Wow, wait a minute. I thought that the only goal was to get into first jhana. No, we've gotten to first jhana so that we can get the mind fit for really the work that needs to be done. That in fact, jhana was something that happened a lot before. In fact, the Buddha references that he could do that when he was a child. The first jhana is a common— it's not a big deal. Anyone can do it. But getting into it and then sustaining it, that's a deeper skill, to be able to maintain that state of mind. But what the Buddha did not do in his youth when he had the first Jhana, he thought that like everybody else, oh well, once you get first Jhana, the next thing to do is to get second, then the third, and then the fourth. They begin to climb the ladder of goals and success. And he made that same mistake, and that's why he at one time thought that even as high as all the Jhanas that he could go, they didn't have any value because it didn't solve the problem with suffering. Why? Because when you come out of the Jhanas, there you are again, back into one's regular crap, right? And so the real teaching of the Buddha then is not the first Jhana, but what to do in the first Jhana, what to do when the mind is fit for work. Okay, so we can talk about that at a later time, but I want to get the thing introduced that we're going to be getting the mind fit for work so that we can put it to work. And what you could say in shorthand is what we're going to do once the mind is fit for work is to do the noting that the Mahasi Method was doing, but they were doing it dry. They didn't have the skills. And so what they are noting is the Dukkha. Well, if you've got no Dukkha, now what are we going to note? Reality, the things, the way that things really are. And so that's getting the mind fit for work, means we've got it sharp enough that we can continue. And so the first part of the job then is to keep monitoring the mind and bringing the wholesome thoughts back one after another. When the mind wanders away, never mind, start again, come back, take a deep breath, start watching the breath, and begin to feel good. That's the teaching. That's the teaching for applied. So we apply the mind to the wholesome and then we sustain it, gladden the mind. We begin to feel good, we feel relaxed, and we get the attitude, I can do this. And so that's the basic introduction to Anapanasati. In this, we have covered Step 9, Step 10, Step 5, Step 6, Step 4, Step 1. We've already been covering all of those things of Anapanasati, but we haven't been using it by the numbers. We've been just talking about it in a more natural way.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so we'll talk about what to do with Anapanasati once we have the body relaxed, the feelings of Piti and Sukkha, and a mind that is only having holds some thoughts. Now what do we do with it? Now we're going to investigate how the mind works. Now we're going to investigate how the mind gets into Dukkha. This is the thing that we're going to do with it, which means that now, finally, after all of this preparation with Anapanasati and getting ourselves into the Third Noble Truth and using the Eightfold Noble Method to get ourselves there. Now what we're going to do is we're going to do a deep dive and a deep investigation into the second noble truth, the cause of suffering. What does the mind do that creates the suffering? And we can only do this in a lab that is absolutely clean, right? Just like, just like in research, in biological research, they have to have a clean room. Or even if they're doing, let us say, doing computer chips, they need a clean room so that they can work with just that. Okay, so in order to see reality, we have to remove all the Dukkha first so that we can actually see what's going on. This is the job then, once the mind is in First Jhana, is that we've got a job to do and we've got the mind fit for work so that we can do it. So we'll talk about more of this at a later time, but this is the idea of where this is going for you. But all we need to do is just remember that I don't have to do what I was doing before. I can do something that is enjoyable instead— having happy thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So, um, I imagine that you can do this that you could practice this. I think you can do it. Next time we'll talk about schedules and all of that kind of stuff. But right now you can just continue to do whatever practice that you've been doing, but you can incorporate this new stuff into it.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right. So when are you going to call again?

**Speaker B:** Probably a week.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Weekends are good.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** On 9 o'clock on Saturday morning, our time, which is Friday evening, there is a Sangha call, and we have— oh, yesterday was 5 or 6 people on it.

**Speaker B:** I'm just jotting that down.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** What time? That's 9.

**Speaker A:** It's 6 o'clock Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern. At 9 o'clock Thai time, uh, during regular time and daylight saving time, Central Time is 12 hours. But in, uh, regular time, the wintertime, uh, Eastern Time is 12 hours. I don't know where do you live?

**Speaker B:** I live in Winnipeg.

**Speaker A:** Winnipeg is Eastern time zone. No, wait a minute, Winnipeg, no, that's, uh, that's in Central because it's right across from Detroit.

**Speaker B:** Central, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so you're in Central time, so that, that would mean that, uh, that it would start at 8. Okay, on Friday evenings.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So how do I get the link if I wanted to join in for that?

**Speaker A:** I'll, I'll send it to you, but if you've already seen the videos, every description Now the newer videos all have the description for the link.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Sangha US and Sangha UK.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Oh yeah, I did see the Sangha UK. I don't think I saw the US one, but I just might not have noticed.

**Speaker A:** Yes, the Sangha US. Danny is running the Sangha UK. Well, actually we have two of them. One's on Sunday afternoon, which is UK time, but that's the middle of the night for you.

**Speaker B:** I'll pass on that one, but this other one sounds good.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, the one at 8 on Friday evenings, you're invited to join us there. Okay, Susan, well, this has been a really enjoyable time. I've enjoyed our conversation. I'm glad to see you nodding and smiling. Indicates that you're hearing what I have to say. That's great.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, I appreciate it so much.

**Speaker A:** Well, I hope to be good friends, that that's what the Dharma— I haven't even talked about that, but the real Dharma is all about friendship anyway, for you to learn to become friends on the inside so that you can finally learn to be friends with people on the outside.

**Speaker B:** Beautiful.

**Speaker A:** So we'll see you later.

**Speaker B:** Okay, thank you.

**Speaker A:** Okay, bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a student named Susan (Speaker B), is a comprehensive critique of common Western approaches to Buddhism and a presentation of a core, simplified practice based on the earliest suttas.

Here is a structured summary of the key points:

### **Core Thesis: The Buddha Taught Only One Thing**
*   The Buddha's teaching is singular: **Dukkha and its cessation (Dukkha-Nirodha)**. The goal is the immediate ending of dissatisfaction, not a long, analytical immersion into it.

### **Critique of "Western Buddhism"**
1.  **Misplaced Focus:** Western practice is criticized for over-emphasizing analyzing and sitting with suffering ("Dukkha, Dukkha, Dukkha") while neglecting the immediate possibility of its cessation.
2.  **Problem of Translation:** Fundamental errors in translating Pali terms have distorted the teachings, often framing them in a Christian context (e.g., seeing Dukkha as "suffering" on a cross).
3.  **Key Term Corrections:**
    *   **Dukkha/Sukkha:** Not suffering/happiness, but **dissatisfaction/satisfaction**. Satisfaction is a skill to be developed.
    *   **Samadhi:** Not "concentration," but **unification or organization** of the mind's factors (like a well-assembled clock).
    *   **Sati:** Not vague "mindfulness," but **remembering to wake up** and look at the mind's state.
    *   **Saddhā:** Not "faith," but **confidence** born from experiential evidence.
    *   **Nibbāna:** Not a distant heavenly state, but **"chilling out"**—cooling, calming, letting go.
4.  **Cultural Baggage:** Western capitalism, competitiveness, goal-orientation ("attainments"), and the desire for "something special" are seen as obstacles to the simple practice of finding satisfaction in the present.

### **The Corrected Framework: The Noble Method**
1.  **Two Paths:** There's an **ordinary path** (Sīla, Samādhi, Paññā) for beginners, and a **Noble Eightfold *Method*** (Paññā, Samādhi, Sīla). The talk advocates starting with the noble method.
2.  **The Heart of the Practice:** Moving from being a **victim** (looking for external saviors) to taking **personal responsibility** (Second Noble Truth). The core doubt to overcome is, "Am I up to the task of freeing myself?"
3.  **Third Noble Truth is Immediate:** The end of dissatisfaction is not a future goal. We have all experienced it. The task is to recognize it, cultivate it, and be **satisfied** with even small amounts of ease and joy.
4.  **The Eightfold Noble Method in Action:**
    *   **Right View (Paññā):** An investigative *verb*, not a fixed belief. It starts the process.
    *   **Right Effort:** The work of changing unwholesome thoughts to wholesome ones.
    *   **Right Mindfulness (Sati):** Remembering to "wake up and smell the coffee"—to check the mind's state.
    *   **Right Attitude/Intention (Sammā Saṅkappa):** The **confidence** of a "winner," not a victim. This is the result of successful practice.

### **The Unified Practice: Ānāpānasati**
*   The Buddha taught **only one complete practice**: **Ānāpānasati** (mindfulness of breathing).
*   It fulfills the **Four Foundations of Mindfulness** (turned inward: body, feelings, mind, mind-objects).
*   Its practice develops the factors of the **Eightfold Noble Method**, which, when matured, become the **Seven Factors of Enlightenment**.
*   **The Core Technique:** Use the breath. When you remember (Sati), take a long, deep, relaxing breath. This is the moment of practice. When the mind wanders, "never mind, start again."

### **The Goal: A Mind Fit for Work**
1.  **First Jhāna is Accessible:** It's the mind unified with wholesome thoughts, free from hindrances, accompanied by joy (pīti) and pleasure (sukha). It's a natural state we drift in and out of; the skill is in intentionally entering and sustaining it.
2.  **Purpose of Jhāna:** It is not the final goal. It creates a **mind "fit for work"**—calm, clear, and satisfied.
3.  **The Real Work:** With a cleansed, fit mind, you can then investigate the **Second Noble Truth** with precision: *How does the mind actually create dukkha?* This is the "deep dive" done in a "clean lab," not from a state of distress.

### **Practical Takeaways**
*   **Stop creating misery:** We talk ourselves into feeling bad with "oughts" and "shoulds" learned in childhood.
*   **Start creating satisfaction:** Talk yourself into feeling good. Have wholesome, happy thoughts intentionally.
*   **It's about letting go, not gaining:** The path is **housecleaning**—dropping mental baggage, not attaining special states.
*   **Practice simply:** Start easy, like going to the gym. Develop the skill in seclusion so you can use it when needed (like during illness).
*   **The Dharma is Friendship:** Ultimately, it's about learning to be a friend to yourself internally, which allows true friendship with others.

**In essence,** the talk is a call to abandon complex, striving, goal-oriented meditation for a simple, gentle, and immediate practice: using the breath to wake up, cultivate wholesome thoughts and satisfaction in the present moment, and thereby develop the confidence and clarity to see and uproot the very mechanism of suffering.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on your transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors and stories** to critique Western interpretations of Buddhism and explain his understanding of the core teachings. Here are the key ones:

### **1. The "Cake" Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** Compares Buddhist practice to baking a cake.
*   **Purpose:** To illustrate that Western Buddhism is missing essential "ingredients" (like joy, satisfaction, the Third Noble Truth), resulting in a dry, unsatisfying practice ("a Mahasi cake").
*   **Quote:** *"If you leave sugar out of a cake, it's not going to be a cake... the sugar has been removed from the teachings of the Buddha by the Westerners."*

### **2. The "Door" vs. "Path" Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** Contrasts a "path" (a long journey) with a "door" (immediate access).
*   **Purpose:** To argue that the Eightfold Path is not a long journey to a distant goal, but a immediate **method** (like a key) to access a peaceful mind **right here**.
*   **Quote:** *"the door is right here. There's no path to take, but there is the method of turning this, putting in the key, turning the key, turning the handle, and pushing the door open."*

### **3. The "Alarm Clock" Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** Compares a well-organized, functioning mind to a cleaned and oiled alarm clock.
*   **Purpose:** To explain *Samadhi* not as forced "concentration" (smashing the clock), but as the natural, harmonious **organization** of mental factors.
*   **Quote:** *"That clock then, with all of its parts and pieces and component pieces together, would be Samadhi. It's working."*

### **4. The "Messy Room" Story**
*   **What it is:** The story of walking into a room that is a complete wreck.
*   **Purpose:** To illustrate the "first level of doubt" and the mistaken Western mindset: looking for **someone else** (a guru, doctor, etc.) to clean up our internal mess, instead of taking personal responsibility.
*   **Quote:** *"What's the first thought that we have? Something like, 'what happened here?' Or, 'who made this mess?'... Because we want somebody else to clean it up."*

### **5. The "Weed" Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** Compares unwholesome thoughts to a weed growing through pavement.
*   **Purpose:** To advocate for the simple, repetitive practice of "whacking off" unwholesome thoughts as they arise (changing them to wholesome ones), rather than the Western approach of trying to violently dig up the "root" through intense, analytical struggle.
*   **Quote:** *"Every time that the weed comes up, throws up a shoot, we can whack it off at the surface. Pretty soon... the root will die."*

### **6. The "Barbie Doll" Story**
*   **What it is:** A story about a child destroying an expensive Barbie doll.
*   **Purpose:** To show how we are taught "importance" and conditioned by external authorities, which creates mental baggage. The child's natural, playful investigation (like a clear mind) is punished in favor of valuing external, conditioned judgments.
*   **Quote:** *"What is she teaching that child? She's teaching the child importance. Where the child was merely playing."*

### **7. The "Power Supply / Wire" Analogy**
*   **What it is:** An analogy of getting a shock from a live wire.
*   **Purpose:** To explain why we notice *dukkha* (pain/shock) but overlook *sukkha* (pleasure/no shock). We are wired to pay attention to dissatisfaction, ignoring moments of satisfaction.
*   **Quote:** *"If the power is not there, I don't notice it at all... we tend to remember the things that we don't like and we tend to forget about the things that we do like."*

### **8. The "Clean Room" Metaphor**
*   **What it is:** Compares a mind prepared for deep insight to a scientific clean room.
*   **Purpose:** To explain that you must first use *ānāpānasati* to create a mind free of *dukkha* (a "clean room") **before** you can effectively investigate the true nature of mind and the cause of suffering.
*   **Quote:** *"in order to see reality, we have to remove all the Dukkha first so that we can actually see what's going on."*

### **Other Key Metaphorical Language:**
*   **"Dry" vs. "Juicy" Practice:** Contrasts Western, analytical "dry" insight with the Buddha's "juicy" path that includes joy (*pīti*) and pleasure (*sukha*).
*   **"Waking up and smelling the coffee":** Used to define *Sati* not as "mindfulness" of a task, but as **waking up** to the present reality of one's own mind.
*   **"Chill out" / "Cool off":** A simple, demystified metaphor for *Nibbana* (Nirvana).
*   **"Housecleaning" / "Dropping Baggage":** Describes the goal of practice as **removing** mental defilements, not **attaining** special states.

**Overall Theme:** The speaker consistently uses metaphors to:
1.  **Critique** a perceived Western, goal-oriented, analytical, and joyless approach to Buddhism.
2.  **Illustrate** his alternative: a simple, immediate, and joyful practice focused on personal responsibility, cultivating satisfaction (*sukha*), and letting go.
