### Transcript


**Speaker A:** It's always a girl. Never mind.

**Speaker B:** Anyways, basically the practice and what I'm noticing is, okay, well, this is sort of on my not-to-do list now, essentially, as you would put it. And I'm almost— I really like the word Athanmayata, because I just watched one of the videos on that, and I really like how you described sort of the booger flicking, because this is a very sticky booger. And it's very interesting, a couple of components that I've noticed in the meditation practice, or I wouldn't even call it that, I would just call it just the practice, just Dhamma. Is that one thing is that I can seem— it seems like I'm able to know when I'm going to think about it. You know what I mean?

**Speaker A:** Yes, I do.

**Speaker B:** Like, I can sense it coming on. It might be in the feeling component is coming on first or something like that. Or maybe I'm connecting a pattern before the actual verbal thought has come out. But I can sense it, and at that point is when I'm gladdening the mind and flicking that booger off as hard as I can, essentially, and trying to keep the mind clean in that way, which has been surprisingly successful, I think.

**Speaker A:** Oh really? Well, that's quite different from— you were just talking about a wild ride, so which is it? Wow, that is such a wild ride.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it is. Because at the same time, it's— I would say it's also kind of a binary ride wherein if I'm taking a break or close my— if I rest my eyes for a moment, you know, go to watch a video and see something that reminds me of the situation. And I'm not guarded, it only takes about a thought, just one thought to get me running, like really almost folded over. And that, and like a full, you know, 100 gallons of adrenaline pumped in. It only takes like one quick thought to get that going.

**Speaker A:** It seems like that's what we would call a mind moment. And basically it would say The mind moment would be seeing what it is that causes panic. And then the panic button is the same as hitting the panic button is the same as turning the adrenaline spigot on. That takes about 2 mind moments, takes about 200 milliseconds. If you're fast, you can begin to see that stuff.

**Speaker B:** I'm seeing it. I see it. And so because of that, portion of things, I would say that I've also noticed— let's say I've been— because I said I've been forced to— I use the word forced before. But if I do let those two my moments slip and I fall down into that position, it really takes what I would say almost like a Herculean effort to come out of that. But, and so I just remember I could recall to one period of time where it's just like, I really like, wow, like I was good a minute ago and now I'm not. And then I just said like, this is really like really bad. But what I kind of did was in one of those situations where I wasn't able to flick it off because it was just probably just too, too sticky at that point, was just start like I just located it in the body. I just tried locating it and I tried like breathing into it. And then I did what you kind of do when you talk about pain, which is just to look at it like a sensation. And I tried to— and then I said, you know, what if like, what if I were to try to like this, like crippling sensation right now. What if I try to like it and enjoy it and maybe it's not so bad? And then if I come to that point, it seems to lighten the weight that needs to be lifted because I'm saying that this is okay, that it feels like that. And then I'm saying everything is okay. And then before you know it, I'm feeling okay is how I put it. That's kind of a way of sort of climbing out of the ditch. When I do slip into the ditch in that way.

**Speaker A:** Excellent way of putting it. Yes, I used to use the word ditch in the sense of the ditch is along the path, and here we go booging down the path, and then next thing we know we're in the ditch. How do we climb out of the ditch? You just named the little methods of it. That's really great. How do you get yourself out of that ditch?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I guess so. Like the smaller, the smaller ones when you could just flick it off with like, aha, Mara, I see you. That's kind of like maybe just like tripping a little bit or, or something like that, you know, along the path.

**Speaker A:** Ah, but practicing that in the beginning when it's still a toy, you can easily begin to make the really little things a toy. Okay, and so the little kid here is taking his little toy truck and he's going zoom, zoom, zoom, and he's controlling it, but the kid gets free freaked out when it's a real truck, right? Like, loss of a girlfriend is now a real truck. Okay, well, guess what you could do with that? The same thing that you were doing with the little things. You got to take the effort though to flick it off.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, it's, it's, uh, the unremitting nature of the, of that truck that you're describing there is forcing me to kind of have the unremitting nature of my own Sati. Because if I don't, then it's going to get me. It's just like, it's kind of crazy. It's kind of like, I don't know, I feel like I need to go to sleep with one eye open now. It's like I need to continuously watch. Like I need to be on watch.

**Speaker A:** That is a really, really excellent metaphor for exactly what we're talking about. Yes, and many expressions like that— be on guard, wakey wakey. You can hear these words built into that, and your analogy of sleeping with one eye open is precisely that, because that's exactly what's going on in the sense of we go around sleepwalking all day, and we're asking, well, at least open one eye.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, yeah, it's pretty, pretty interesting. Um, it was funny too because one of my, one of my friends wanted to talk about the situation and I was like, I, I don't think that I could do that because it's just gonna be another pity party and just

**Speaker A:** going— it would be just another pity party. In fact, they came for that. They wanted you to tell them the story. They came to watch a movie. Yeah, this is just episode 6 of Broken Heart. I turned— yeah, they came to— right, they came with popcorn and you wouldn't entertain them with your pity party.

**Speaker B:** I turned it down. I told them we could talk about the Dharma surrounding it, that I've renounced what the mistake that was made or whatever that landed me in that situation, in that We could talk about wholesome things of right now, but I don't want to talk about— I don't want

**Speaker A:** to talk about— I don't want to— exactly right.

**Speaker B:** Made-up stories.

**Speaker A:** Well, you see, this is the waking up process that we've been talking about, and you're seeing it in action for yourself. And so congratulations for that. This is good. And when you were talking about it, when you said it's been a wild ride, I was thinking, I've got to check this out, is that grandiose or what? And after that, you kind of said how beneficial it was with Arahant, with Anapanasati and the Dhamma to get through that period of time. And so what I'm looking at right now is confirmation for the unsaid things was, is that without the Dharma, it would have been a hell of a ride, with the emphasis upon hell.

**Speaker B:** Wow.

**Speaker A:** And that the Dharma actually changed it from nothing but, um, uh, from, from that, that hell of a ride into nothing but just a wild ride.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I would say so. I would imagine that the moments when I'm— when I've described when I'm asleep and a thought like that does come in, well, I'm guessing that's how I would be without the Dhamma all the time. That would be hell because those moments are hell.

**Speaker A:** Well, guess what? That thought will then help you when you expand it will lead to compassion. Do you see now how much all your friends and neighbors and the people around you suffer, and they try to hide from it and ignore it, but they really don't escape it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

**Speaker A:** That in fact, they enjoy, in a way, pity parties. They enjoy their own misery. And so therefore they're ignoring it. They're lying to themselves about what misery is and tell them that, well, I can't change my misery.

**Speaker B:** The misery has become untenable. I can't deal with it anymore. I got it. They always got to get out of it. And I just like, you know, I feel that coming on. Is that like a I almost want to say like what I was describing initially about, I know when I'm about to think that thought. It's kind of like when you're talking to a friend and like you look each other in the eye and you know you're thinking the same thing, but you haven't like said anything yet. Is that just normal or is that like a deeper level of Sati?

**Speaker A:** Actually, it is a deeper level of Sati, but what it is, is that now you're beginning to see the startup. That in fact the spark and the first blaze was there, and you saw that, but you didn't blow on it. You didn't kindle that fire. You didn't keep it going. You didn't build it up and give it a lot of energy. It was just one mind moment. You say, aha, I see that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Oh boy, you can get it right down to that initial point that, yeah, you can see those thoughts. And in Buddhism, they talk about it as they arise. Or another way of saying it, the way that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about it, is mindfulness at the point of contact. In other words, when that thought contacted you, when it first got you, before you ever went into the clinging to that thought. Or the clinging associated with that thought. You saw that thought when it happened, when it hit you, and that gives rise to wise feelings. And many of the times the wise feelings are a feeling of chuckling. It's like, ah, I see that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Um, and that's the best thing to do, because if we don't see it, it will still contact us, but this time it may turn on the anxiety tap. That's the clinging.

**Speaker B:** It's very sneaky.

**Speaker A:** The adrenaline faucet just turns right on. We got a built-in machine with a pump and all that called the adrenaline gland.

**Speaker B:** Yep. What I'm kind of, uh, wary of is because I've already seen it I've already seen it just from like sitting here and just like watching a YouTube video about something that could remind me of my not-to-do. And that'll— that if I'm not on guard, especially in that moment, or even if I am, even if I am on guard, you know, there's still that one mind moment that I end up needing to catch. And I just know, like, going outside, passing by the old restaurant that you used to go to, or whatever it is, that type of thing. I just know that it's going to be— it's going to like, you know, throw all these things into my, you know, these patterns are going to bring up all the things that I want to keep out of my mind. So it's just like a little bit, you know, it's that I can see the value in seclusion in that way that if I was just, you know, kind of keeping my mind in the Dharma and keeping my mind like here and now.

**Speaker A:** Funny how the mind wants to wallow in that stuff. I could see the movie going on now that this guy keeps returning to the restaurant where he and his girlfriend used to go all the time and where they finally broke up. He just won't let it go. And here you are recognizing the danger in walking into that place. Okay, I have no— I have an old Thai story that I got here in Thailand that is just absolutely really similar to that. And the story is about the old man who had been going to the temple for many years. He had been a monk when he was younger and probably intends to reordain it when he retires, but he's already on the board. He's like a deacon and that kind of stuff. So So the life of the temple is really a big part of his life. That's the point that I'm trying to get to. And now a new monk moves into the temple, and the first thing that happens is he gets into an argument with that monk. And so he leaves the temple, and now because he has been practicing Anapanasati, he knows that he's going to make the temple— the whole show, the whole wat— is off limits to the mind. This is on his don't-do-that list. Don't go to the wat, not with your body and not with your feet and not with your mind. Don't go there.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** Get over that for a while. Let that cool off. Let that rest until it's finally over. But then he can go happily back to that, and it doesn't— now the what doesn't mean anything, or it means what it did in the old days before that argument happened. Well, guess what? If he has that kind of attitude, he can get over it really fast. He may be back there next week. All right, that's finished with now. If you will stay out of it, we deal with it, is we get it out of the mind, we get rid of it, we let it be really old stuff. We already, in fact, because we put it on the don't go there list, we don't go there anymore.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, this is the first time that I, uh, um, and I just have two comments on that kind of one is that as you said, like, as the time goes by, it's not going to be as hot anymore. It's going to cool off. And I noticed that too, like, I could think about older exes and things like that, and there's no— like, it doesn't really bother me.

**Speaker A:** No end to it. I bet you can come up with 10 or 20 tragedies if you sit there with a piece of paper trying to write down the major tragedies you've had in your life, the ways you really screwed up, the time you got fired, the time you threw up on your boss, the time you brought snot on the girl. I mean, there's so many of them, tragedy after the— one after another after another. All Or we can stay out of that and recognize, hey, that was a different person at a different time, and he survived. You can too. Yeah, use all of that stuff as stuff that's just on your don't-to-do list. You just don't do that stuff anymore. I don't have to worry about that. I did it once because it's not me now that did it then. That was a different person. I grew up. Yeah, not a child anymore. Yeah, I think there's anatta in full display right there, is to do that with our past momentarily. I am not that that happened in the past. It's not me. This is who I am right now. And guess what? There I go. Now a new me.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Forget that part then. I forgot what the other comment was going to be. I think, yeah, I forgot what I was going to say about that.

**Speaker A:** We were working on your tragedy. You had— I gave you a list of 20 tragedies, but you were thinking about all the tragedies or one tragedy that you've had.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. No, I think— well, I was— at

**Speaker A:** least your word, tragedy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So like the tragedies that happened in the— I mean, obviously it's like no point in going back. I'm not saying that there's any point. It's definitely on the not-to-do list. But I was just saying, you know, that's interesting and how you said like the guy could go back after a week if he really keeps his mind out of it. For me, it's kind of been like years for these older situations. But now that's been like years, like it doesn't bother me as much if I think about like stuff that from like years ago, but you still rather not think about it.

**Speaker A:** Well, the only reason why it still bothers you now is because it's been bothering you from time to time all along. But if you have that whole general idea of the don't-do list, is like anything that happened in the past, you can actually do it by cities. Oh, I used to live in San Francisco, therefore no thoughts of San Francisco.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly.

**Speaker A:** And I'm not talking about just one tiny little thing. It's because if I go in that vicinity, I'll fall into that hole, and I know that. So I'm just going to block the whole show off because I don't need hardly anything that happened in the past. This present moment is just fine, thank you very much.

**Speaker B:** It's dangerous there.

**Speaker A:** It is dangerous to go into the past.

**Speaker B:** It's a high, high crime rate in that area, town, state.

**Speaker A:** I know I'm the number one criminal.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. There was a point I had made notes, but I can't even look at it now because it's on my phone. But sorry, you go ahead.

**Speaker A:** No, go ahead. You're here.

**Speaker B:** Yes. I mean, that's basically what I'm going through right now is just doing that. And my practice, I started to do like 20-minute sessions now because I noticed I was able to get like a little bit deeper Jhana with the 20-minute. I can kind of sink into it more.

**Speaker A:** All right, you use that word. Let's have an examination, pop quiz.

**Speaker B:** And I'll give you a meditation Anapanasati.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, if it is in fact First Jhana and you know it's First Jhana, you know it because you know all the constituent components of First Jhana.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And if you know it by the fact that, hey, you feel really, really good, then you can use those kind of terms because you can know it by the way that you experience it. So you can get it either from one direction or the other. You can either come out of experience into the knowledge of this is first jhana, or you can take with the knowledge of first jhana and all those components, make them, collect them, build them up, and now you've got first jhana. These are the two ways to do it.

**Speaker B:** Can you say that again?

**Speaker A:** Both ways to the middle.

**Speaker B:** I don't think I followed that one.

**Speaker A:** All right, I'll say it again. Yeah, we can either start with the word jhana, investigate it, get it all, its constituent components, find out what each component actually is, and then build those things up so that you have Jhana, because you know what you were looking for in the first place, and there you developed it, there you found it, you brought those factors together, and the factoring of those 5 factors coming together is first Jhana. Okay, that's one approach. The second approach is to just practice Anapanasati to the point you feel really good. Yeah, and then you can say, okay, within that feeling of what I've got now, I also experienced the feeling of well-being, the feeling of success, the feeling of happiness, the feeling of fearlessness, and my mind is sharp and awake, and I know what's going on, and I feel really good about it. And so there I have just discovered within myself that I have already created the 5 factors And so now I can say, all right, those 5 factors that I have created can now have the application, or tied with a bow, of the name Jhana.

**Speaker B:** I think that's the one that I'm doing, because what I actually do is just, you know, sit down and then start talking myself into feeling good. I start like just saying the you know, breathing in, I feel really, really good, and breathing out, I relax and go with that and go with safety and security, that kind of thing. And then I'm doing the deep breathing. So, you know, and just remembering on each breath.

**Speaker A:** That's the easy way to do it. And it's also what Bhikkhu Buddhadasa would call the natural method. If you get into it and then somebody will tell you, yeah, you've got all of those components, or you can understand for yourself, yeah, this is it. Right, okay, so now I experience this, and if this is not First Jhana, then whatever First Jhana is, I don't need it because I like this. Yeah, okay. And so that's the way of going with it, is through the experience of it, as opposed to the organized method where we talk about all the components and getting them together and developing them one at a time in order until we know that we've got the group together, and then we can check because we've got the checkoff list. I've got all of them. Now I can go back to the original frame of reference of I've got that Jhana that I was looking for. That's the organized way. You start with Jhana, break it into the components, develop the components, and then place the components together, and now you've got what you were planning on doing. Well, I actually— that's not the natural method, that's the organized method. That's not the way that I would recommend. Yeah, okay.

**Speaker B:** Maybe I have a misunderstanding of like the, what the Jhana, like in that organized method, what that actually is. Because the way I look at it is that the, um, the Jhana factors, they kind of are the same thing as Anapanasati when I kind of look at it.

**Speaker A:** Absolutely, absolutely. By the steps, each and every one of the aspects of the first Jhana are in one of, or a combination of, the steps of Anapanasati. The whole show is right there. The two that give it away is Sati— excuse me, is Piti and Sukkha, right? The term— but then you can begin to see the other, uh, you cannot have the Piti and the Sukkha unless you can gladden the mind by throwing the hindrances out. So yeah, exactly, so it fits right together. This Anapanasati practice is the practice of first Jhana, the natural method.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think what the question I was maybe going to ask was about Am I leaving something on the table? Should I be, you know, because I was looking at, uh, I'm just thinking about like my— oh, you're talking about

**Speaker A:** how do you deal with that Nusod dissatisfaction? I'm leaving something on the table. No, no, no, my success is really success, but it's not as good as it could be. I'm just a little bit dissatisfied with my satisfaction here.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I guess that's what I'm doing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you're right. Yeah, well, that has to be noticed so that you can deal with that one too. You can say, 'Aha, I see you, dissatisfaction, creeping into my satisfaction, and out you go also.'

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And what is this table that something is left on anyway? Out you go too. I'm just what I left on the table, but the table goes.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, wow.

**Speaker A:** And I'm okay, I'm good. This is it. We go for that state, that state of satisfaction. That's the Sukkha.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so that's why it's actually not correctly translated as sensual pleasure. Well, because sensual pleasure always has to do with delight in the sense of the eyes and the ears taking in some sensual object and delighting in it, like a Hoochie Coochie dancer or something.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** yeah, okay. Or the belly dancer, or or whatever, we take delight in the senses. But Sukkha is actually completely satisfied, not enthralled. It's a different feeling. And so that's why sensual pleasure doesn't quite fit what Sukkha is. In fact, sensual pleasure actually has desire intuitively built into it.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:DHAMMARATO] Yeah. That's— it's kind of the opposite because my Sukkha is, is, wow, it's so nice to be free.

**Speaker A:** Wow, this is right. This is so nice. Exactly. This is it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. I like to think about, like, taking like a heavy backpack off as my Sukkha. Sort of. I think about that, you know.

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly. I think we've used that as an analogy, is to set that luggage down.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah, that's definitely what I like to run with. You know, I guess I don't have any more like real updates other than that. I would say I had an instance a couple of times. Yeah, I feel like I've had a couple of times now where I sit down to do the meditation practice, to do Anapanasati. And I'll just like get up like after a few minutes or something like that. Or like, I'm just— I'm talking about specifically when I'm probably like at my worst in dealing with this recent not to think about situation where the emotions will just become way too overwhelming. And I'll just kind of bail on sitting is what I've done like a couple of times. Like, I'm not saying I'm doing that now, but I've done like— but I found like actually getting up and maybe coming in and listening to some more Dhamma talks or actually it kind of feels like when I make the decision to like it's not the right time to sit down and do this right now. And that actually, if I just go and do whatever it is I was going to do, but maybe just be on guard a little bit more, maybe, or something like that. I don't know. Like, it seems like it comes out. It ends up being like even better than if— maybe not better, but it ends up like I ended up working it out and getting better. Like, just by— I don't know, maybe it's because I took my mind off it. I went and did something else.

**Speaker A:** I don't know. I'm trying to put it up, but you're, you're talking about things that happen normally, and there are values and ways of looking at it. First off, we're talking about a particular time that doesn't happen often, but that you know that your mind is in no condition to be able to— if I sit down for meditation, will I actually be able to keep my mind focused on the breath and on the body, that it will naturally go right back into that sewer that I keep climbing out of. Yes, okay, that's the point. So what do I do when I know that I don't have any control, that my loss or my hunger for that sweet babe that's just walked out, pining over my laptop that I just spilled coffee on this morning, and it's gone poof. And so now I don't have anything to do with the rest of my day because I've lost my poor laptop. And how am I going to replace it? And you know the whole show. I mean, we can go right into those sewers. There are two of them. I can— I've been into so many different sewers, I can tell you all about how to— what kind of sewage that we can get into. But the point is, is that when we know that it's really hard for us to stay out of the sewage, then reading Dhamma books is really the right way to go.

**Speaker B:** Really?

**Speaker A:** Now we can do that at various levels.

**Speaker B:** I just listen to these videos. That's what I do.

**Speaker A:** That would be one of the levels of going to. Another one would be reading any Dhamma book indiscriminately anything will do what I would say is the worst case. And so in that regard, any video, any video is better than that sewer. Okay, maybe a Groucho Marx movie would be better than that video that I was playing up here. Okay, and by the way, uh, that's a plug for Groucho Marx.

**Speaker B:** Groucho Marx, I never heard of him.

**Speaker A:** Are you kidding me?

**Speaker B:** You might be before my time.

**Speaker A:** He and 3 other brothers made movies in the 1930s of slapstick comedy. Eventually, in the 1950s, as an older man, he was on television. And his, uh, the movies that he and his brother made are really, really important classics. For a variety of reasons. He had Chico, his brother, and Harpo. Harpo Marx actually played the harp, and some of the movies they have him being a concert harpist. Okay, but Groucho was the comedian. So let's take it away from that and we'll do Smothers Brothers because that's closer to your birth age in the 1970s. Right? But any movie, any slapstick— okay, so Dumb and Dumber— to get our mind off of our problems, it doesn't matter what our entertainment is so long as we've got our mind off of the problem. I think you've frozen. Well, maybe


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a Sangha friend (Speaker B), focuses on applying Buddhist practice to navigate intense emotional pain, specifically the aftermath of a painful breakup.

Here is a summary of the key themes and teachings:

**Core Practice: The "Not-To-Do" List & Guarding the Mind**
*   The practitioner (Speaker B) describes using a central technique taught by Dhammarato: creating a "not-to-do" list for the mind. This means consciously deciding not to dwell on certain painful thoughts, memories, or stories (like the recent breakup).
*   He uses the vivid metaphor of **"flicking off a sticky booger"** (a thought) as soon as he senses it arising, using gladdening the mind (a step in Anapanasati) to maintain mental cleanliness.

**The Challenge: The "Mind Moment" and the "Ditch"**
*   The talk explores the difficulty of this practice. Speaker B notes that if he is "asleep" (not mindful), a single thought can trigger a full-blown panic/adrenaline response almost instantly—a **"mind moment."**
*   Falling into this state is described as falling into a **"ditch."** The practitioner shares his method for climbing out: locating the sensation in the body, breathing into it, and then applying a radical acceptance—trying to "like" or "enjoy" the crippling sensation to disarm it and lighten its weight.

**Insights and Progress**
*   **Heightened Awareness:** The practitioner is developing a deeper level of mindfulness (**Sati**), sensing the *arising* of a painful thought pattern *before* it fully forms, allowing him to intercept it "at the point of contact."
*   **Seclusion and Renunciation:** He sees the value in seclusion—avoiding physical and mental triggers (like an old restaurant). He also practices renunciation in conversation, refusing to engage in "pity party" story-telling about the past, choosing instead to discuss only the Dhamma and the present.
*   **From "Hell" to a "Wild Ride":** Dhammarato reframes the experience. Without the Dhamma, this would have been pure hell. With the practice, it becomes a difficult but manageable "wild ride," building compassion for others who suffer similarly without these tools.
*   **Anatta (Not-Self) Applied:** They discuss using the concept of *anatta* to let go of past pain. The person who experienced that tragedy is not the same "self" existing now. The past can be cordoned off as a dangerous neighborhood to avoid.

**Jhana and Anapanasati**
*   The discussion turns to meditation. Speaker B reports going deeper using 20-minute sessions of **Anapanasati** (mindfulness of breathing).
*   Dhammarato clarifies two approaches to **Jhana** (meditative absorption):
    1.  **The Organized Method:** Intellectually understanding and assembling the five Jhana factors.
    2.  **The Natural Method (recommended):** Practicing Anapanasati until you naturally cultivate feelings of joy, happiness, and well-being (**Piti** and **Sukkha**), which *are* the Jhana factors. He emphasizes that **Sukkha** is not sensual pleasure but the profound satisfaction of freedom, like "taking a heavy backpack off."

**Dealing with Overwhelm**
*   Finally, they address what to do when emotions are too overwhelming to sit in formal meditation. Dhammarato advises that it's wise to recognize when the mind is too raw. In those times, engaging with the Dhamma in other ways—like listening to talks—or even watching light, distracting entertainment (like comedy) is a skillful means to avoid the "sewer" of obsessive thinking, and is far better than forcing a sit that leads to more suffering.

**Overall Message:** The talk is a practical guide to using mindfulness (**Sati**), the "not-to-do" list, and meditative gladdening (**Anapanasati**) to guard the mind against habitual suffering. It highlights the transformative power of the Dhamma to change intense personal pain from an unbearable hell into a workable, even instructive, life experience, while developing deeper wisdom and compassion.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the dialogue, here are the key metaphors and stories used by the speakers:

### **Metaphors:**

1.  **"Booger flicking" / "Sticky booger"** – Used to describe the practice of noticing and quickly dismissing an unwholesome thought or feeling before it takes hold. The "sticky booger" is a particularly persistent or tempting thought pattern.
2.  **"Wild ride" / "Binary ride"** – Describes the intense, unpredictable emotional experience of dealing with a painful situation (like a breakup). "Binary" emphasizes how quickly one can shift from being okay to being overwhelmed.
3.  **"Panic button" / "Adrenaline spigot" / "Adrenaline faucet"** – Illustrates how a single thought can instantly trigger a full physiological panic response, as if flipping a switch to release adrenaline.
4.  **"Climbing out of the ditch" / "The ditch is along the path"** – Represents falling into a state of suffering or unwholesome thinking. The spiritual path is the "road," and getting lost in suffering is veering into the "ditch." The practice is the method to climb back out.
5.  **"Mara, I see you"** – A reference to the Buddhist personification of temptation and death (Mara). It's used as a phrase to acknowledge and dismiss a distracting or negative thought as it arises.
6.  **"Toy truck vs. Real truck"** – Compares practicing mindfulness on small, manageable distractions (a toy) to applying it to a major, real-life crisis (a real truck). The skill is the same, but the effort required is much greater.
7.  **"Sleeping with one eye open" / "Be on watch" / "Wakey wakey"** – Metaphors for the vigilant, continuous awareness (Sati) needed to guard the mind against slipping into old, painful thought patterns.
8.  **"Pity party" / "They came to watch a movie... with popcorn"** – Describes the tendency to dwell on and repetitively share one's misery. It frames suffering as a form of self-indulgent entertainment that others might even come to spectate.
9.  **"Hell of a ride" vs. "Wild ride"** – Contrasts suffering without the Dhamma (hellish) to navigating the same difficulty with the Dhamma (merely wild and challenging).
10. **"Spark and first blaze"** – Refers to the very initial moment a thought arises, before it is "kindled" into a full-blown story or emotional reaction. Catching it here is key.
11. **"High crime rate area" / "Dangerous town"** – Refers to the past, especially past traumas or regrets. It's portrayed as a dangerous place for the mind to visit, where it's easy to get mentally "robbed" or hurt.
12. **"Taking a heavy backpack off"** – Describes the feeling of **Sukha** (happiness/bliss in meditation) as a profound relief from burden.
13. **"Sewer"** – A vivid term for the mind's tendency to wallow in negative, repetitive, and unwholesome thoughts.

### **Stories & Analogies:**

1.  **The Thai Man and the Temple:** Speaker A tells a story about an old Thai man who gets into an argument with a new monk at his temple. He puts the entire temple on his "not-to-do list"—avoiding it physically and mentally—to let the conflict cool down. This story directly parallels Speaker B's need to avoid places and thoughts associated with an ex-partner.
2.  **The List of Tragedies:** Speaker A suggests that if one tried, they could list 20 past "tragedies" (e.g., being fired, embarrassing moments). The point is that all past suffering can be put on the "don't-go-there list," recognizing that the person who experienced those things is not the same person one is now (a reflection of *anatta*, or not-self).
3.  **Groucho Marx / Slapstick Comedy:** Used as an example of wholesome distraction. When the mind is too agitated for formal meditation, engaging with light, entertaining content (like old comedies) can be a skillful means to pull it out of the "sewer" of obsessive thinking. This is presented as a better alternative than forcing a failed meditation session.

These metaphors and stories collectively paint a picture of the mind as a space that requires vigilant guarding, where painful thoughts are like intruders, sticky substances, or dangerous places. The Dhamma practice is framed as a set of tools for cleaning, guarding, and skillfully navigating this inner landscape.
