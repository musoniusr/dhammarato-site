### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Welcome everybody, this is a Saturday morning call. It's just after 9 o'clock AM here in Thailand, and it's Friday evening in the US and Western Hemisphere. So Luke, go ahead and speak up when you find it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, sure.

**Speaker A:** Ivan just asked a question, and go ahead and ask that question again.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, so sometimes I'm not sure when to speak in a way that's really truthfully how I feel, because sometimes it might come across as too, too Sopramundan, too I don't know, like for them it doesn't land, so I have to dial down my speech in a way that they will understand in a very mundane way. So yeah, sometimes I'm not sure.

**Speaker A:** It's very— All right.

**Speaker B:** The first thing that we can start.

**Speaker A:** With that is that there's actually a.

**Speaker B:** Sutta about it, and the sutta is number 139. In the Majjhima Nikaya.

**Speaker A:** And in there is recommended several things. One is that we should be speaking in the language of the listener. That in fact, you can see the sutras translations are translations from the Pali This is formal as Arya type of translation as possible, trying to get it right. I also see that in translations of some Thai teachers into English, they do the same thing using sophisticated language. But the sutta number 139 says to speak in the language that can be understood. So that's the first item. The second item about it is that it's actually better to not talk personally.

**Speaker B:** Either about yourself or about the listener, but rather to keep the Dhamma kind of in the abstract. This is one of the reasons why the Buddha is so famous for telling stories. Similes, metaphors, etc., like that, basically to try to teach without rubbing it in. So in their language, so that they understand it. Now, the way that you ask it is kind of strange in the sense that, should I speak in supermundane Dharma.

**Speaker A:** Or speak in ordinary language? And actually.

**Speaker B:** It should be either one of two things: either directly in the supramundane, or number two would be a pace and lead, or start in the mundane and then immediately go into the supramundane. Supramundane.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so that's the way to do it.

**Speaker B:** There's often another possibility, and that is that we give them the supermundane and let them argue about it, and then guide them into understanding of it. And you see that actually done on.

**Speaker A:** Discord quite often, is go ahead and.

**Speaker B:** Use the supermundane and then you can explain it. An example of that is the teacher didn't make you feel bad. You decided to feel bad with what the teacher was doing.

**Speaker A:** That's supramundane.

**Speaker B:** And a lot of people won't understand that because they are under the impression that they are ruled by their feelings, that other people tell them how to feel, and they have to feel the way they're told to feel. And if we agree with that, then we're going in the wrong direction. So we need to have some sort of counter-argument about that, uh, that you're.

**Speaker A:** Not responsible for how other people feel.

**Speaker B:** And other people don't make you feel. This is in fact, right off the bat, the Second Noble Truth.

**Speaker A:** That the.

**Speaker B:** Suffering did not come from the teacher. The suffering came from you didn't like what the teacher said.

**Speaker A:** So I see you shaking your head and nodding your head.

**Speaker B:** So that's the way to go. It's better to go with the supramundane because that's what teaching discussion with Buddhist teaching discussion with Mike.

**Speaker A:** Excuse me, Luke. Luke.

**Speaker D:** Hello, can you hear me?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Did you come up with something?

**Speaker A:** You said you were going to go research a question.

**Speaker D:** Oh yeah, I just— someone had asked a question this morning in the chat after you posted about the call. They said, Sunyata, doing nothing, with a question mark, and then, and when is it wholesome to do something?

**Speaker B:** All right, the obvious answer to that one is that doing nothing is always better if you feel good. But if you feel bad, then the thing to do is to feel good. But if you choose to do something, do it wholesomely. So when is the right time to act is, uh, depending upon the way you feel. That if you don't feel good, if you feel angry, if you feel hostile, then that's the time to set it down, to not respond when you're in bad feelings. You, in fact, uh, answering an angry email— let it sit for a couple of 3 days. Come up with something that's direct. Okay, and if you are direct without— and kind of neutral, like they said, we've got this, and you say, okay, tell me about it, prove that you've got this.

**Speaker A:** And.

**Speaker B:** Um, leave that up to them as to how they're going to feel. Don't be afraid of other people's bad feelings. In fact, that's one of the things that's very interesting about our culture, is that for some reason or another, the whole culture teaches us that we're not supposed to upset others, but it's okay that others upset us. Isn't that interesting? Or that we're out of control. In other words, they're saying that you control other people's feelings and other people control your feelings. Does anybody ever— has anybody ever seen that? Like every time you read something But that's from the ordinary mind. When the mind is noble, we accept how we feel and then change it, which leads in then to, Ivan, into your original first question, which has to do about wisdom at the point of feeling as opposed to wisdom at the point of contact. All right, now what we're actually talking.

**Speaker A:** About here is.

**Speaker B:** Um, the application of Paticcasamuppada. Now, Paticcasamuppada actually is translated as dependent origination, and what that actually means is every little step along the way that the mind travels is dependent upon the step before that. So you can say then, to get a computer turned on, you have to have power. Then the power has to be in the power cable, and then the power cable has to be plugged into the PC, and then you have to hit the start or the on button of the PC, and then the PC will start to power up. Et cetera, one step after another, after another. And any place along the chain that is broken will affect the procedure. So in that regard, we're basically starting right now in this conversation at a point in Paticcasamuppada that's called the Salyatana. Now, I've seen just recently somebody gave this 12 steps of dependent origination on Discord, and for the most part it was correct. But the translation that they gave for Salyatana was not correct. They called it the sixth sense base, but in fact they left out the part that that's the internal sixth sense base. In other words, Your eyes see something on the outside, but then it goes through a process so that you see it on the inside. And that process that it goes through is called perception. And that process of perception uses old data from your past, which is called in Pali the Sankhara, all of the stuff that you built up. So if you see something, you either recognize it and see it, and what we mean by recognize is re-cognize, which means that we've seen it before, we know what it is from before, and when somebody is giving an explanation of something, normally the mind then will create a set of pictures and/or language in order to come up with an internal story. So the savayatana can better be translated as an internal story rather than calling it the sixth sense base, because the sixth sense base actually is part of not perception, not part of the story, but it's part of the original input that the Buddha would use the word consciousness. Now, I will actually talk about consciousness in two senses. One is that in Western language and in philosophy and other places and in Christianity, etc., they consider consciousness as that story we tell ourselves rather than the consciousness of merely input. So there's two different definitions for the word consciousness, and to make sure that we're using it according to the teaching of the Buddha, we can say that consciousness is actually the ability and the process of receiving input. And then we make up a story about it in order to understand the sensory input that in fact recite The only thing that the eyes can do is see color, shapes, and movement, and all of the rest of it is processed into an image that's seen in the mind. That's an important point. In other words, you become responsible right from the outside when it's coming in. You do all the rest. So in that story about the teacher criticizing all that's heard is the sound of the teacher's voice, and then we make it up. If she's speaking in Russian, we don't even know what she's saying, but we can pick up the tone of voice. If we understand the language that she's using, if she's using English, then we pick up the sound, the tone, and possibly the meaning. However, We may in fact make up part of that meaning. So with the teaching of Paticcasamuppada, we can begin to understand that we're making almost everything up. Nobody lives in actual reality that's coming in as input. We live in a perceived reality, which I'm calling the story, the story that we tell ourselves about reality. Now, if you can understand that you're doing that intellectually, or let us say in general as an introduction, then you can begin to look to see that that's what you're doing, that you can see that the story that you just told yourself is a story that you made up. This is what Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about as wisdom at the point of contact. Wisdom at the point of contact means that we have some sort of mechanism to stop it at the point of contact and probably reprocess it and realign or change our story so that then the new story is what contacts us not the original. In other words, you can completely control your feelings. You can feel the way you want to feel by changing the story you tell yourself. The next would be that, um, we often will let the feeling happen ignorantly We let the contact happen ignorantly, giving rise to ignorant feelings, which then gives rise to our wanting, our grasping, our clinging. And all of that is ignorant. So one of the ways that we can begin to understand this is by recognizing that even though when we teach Paticcasamuppada, we teach it in the forward direction, But the way that we process it is in reverse direction, so that the ordinary beginner, the one who's just beginning to understand, will start— or maybe not even understand at all— will come to it from the perspective of being very late in the process. An example of that would be a man and his wife are having an argument. And then he'll say something that he regrets. He's gone over the line. He knows that he's gone over the line, and so what he does is he turns and walks out slamming the door. That's wisdom at the point of Dukkha. Pretty late. It's already happened. The bad feelings have already been there. So I think that Santiago understands what I'm saying, so I see a great big smile on his face. So if we have wisdom at the point of Dukkha, don't you think that's a little late? Nick, do you think that's a little late in the game? A mile behind. Now, what we actually mean by that is the self has already arisen. I'm having an argument. Okay, I'm taking my position. So we can actually have wisdom at the point of the creation of the self, but that's a little late too. We can also see it as late in the sense of the grasping and clinging. But a good example of that would be for the story is about Ajahn Sumedho with Ajahn Chah. They were at a ceremony called the kathin ceremony. I won't go into great detail except to say that all of the young ladies were in their finest. And so at that ceremony, Ajahn Chah asked Ajahn Sumedho What do you think? And he was obviously pointing at the ladies that were passing by. And Ajahn Sumedho says, I like it, but I don't want it.

**Speaker A:** Okay?

**Speaker B:** That's wisdom at the point of feelings. He saw the girls, he liked the girls, but he didn't want the girls, so he was able to stop it without going into wanting and lust and going down that path that would lead to Dukkha. So this was a good example of wisdom at the point of feeling. And now that's actually a very good place to be. If you can see your feelings, you have control over them. You can modify or change the feelings. You can go back and revisit the story that you're telling and then have a new feeling instead. An example of that would be someone sitting, let us say, in meditation or something, and all of a sudden they feel anxiety. They feel that feeling of not liking something, but they don't know really what it is. What we could do with that is, is that do a little bit of research. Like, do you know what it was that triggered you so that you can go back and retell the story and change it? However, it's better when you are seeing the story that you don't give yourself the anxiety. You can change the story before it contacts you. So I see a message at the top of the screen. Mikey, can you help me with that?

**Speaker E:** It's from Arjun. They say, good morning everyone. Wow, Mr. Panda is here too.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** So Ivan, do you have any questions about what we're talking about? This is actually a very simple thing that we've discussed. We haven't gone into much detail of Paticcasamuppada at all. Do you understand the difference then between catching the story before you have feelings about it versus catching the feelings before you go off on them?

**Speaker C:** Yes, I definitely can see that. I guess the interesting— well, I think this is where the practice keeps coming in, right? As we keep practicing, we can catch the story faster and faster and faster.

**Speaker B:** Precisely.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** So the interesting thing is that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks a lot about wisdom at the point of contact. Can you see how the stories that you tell impact you before you have bad feelings about it, or any feelings at all? You can modify the story. Like, for instance, oh, the laptop or the PC didn't turn on. Am I going to feel bad, or I'm going to change that story to, oh well, there's another PC over there, I'll just use it? Mikey knows that story very well. We just did it. So we can, we can change the story when we see the story.

**Speaker C:** Something that makes a lot of sense to me was like the Buddha wouldn't.

**Speaker A:** Be.

**Speaker C:** Upset when the glass is broken because he sees the glass is going to be broken one day eventually. So there's nothing to feel bad about. Would you say that's the point of contact? Okay.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** And so another way of changing the story is it's about time. That's an old glass. So we can change the story. Now we can back up even further than that and see not just the story, but you can see yourself telling the stories. That, that's really fast to be able to actually see yourself processing and coming up with a story. That's the level of perception. And there's an even faster way to do it, and that is to be able to see that you're about to make up a story. And then you don't. You just leave things the way that they are.

**Speaker A:** Okay?

**Speaker B:** That gives rise back to that first question that was asked about Sunyata. When you can see what's going on, but you don't make up any stories, you leave the sensory input as just that, it's empty. And because of that, you don't have any feelings because you didn't make up a story. Because you don't have any feelings, there's no grasping, there's no clinging, And what you could actually say now in this regard is the clinging then is the point of action, that we take action due to our clinging. And so we can say, I like it, I want it, I've got to act on it, I'm going to carry it around, I'm going to do something about it. Oh, it says the battery is low and I should consider plugging it in.

**Speaker A:** I see it's not plugged in. Okay, let's— all right, that looks like it's.

**Speaker B:** All right, so now we're back on. Um, if we can see it at the point of contact, that's the best place to live, because it takes a very, very quiet mind. It takes actually a practitioner to get it any faster than that. But ordinary people, they wait very late in the story before they have any wisdom at all. And in fact, slamming the door on the way out is not even any wisdom at all. He just saw that this argument was going nowhere other than things are getting a lot worse. So the question is, how can we practice this? The right way to say that we can practice this is by beginning to see the way that we feel, and we can also see the thoughts that brought to that, so that we can begin to make a change to the feelings that contact us, giving rise to new feelings. So here we are sitting and having in seclusion and practicing having wholesome thoughts. And then actually, possibly the most famous thought is that I say, everything is okay, not a problem in the world, and I'm okay. And then the next thought is, wait a minute, things are not okay. You don't feel all of that joy at all. So there that unwholesome thought comes up. That unwholesome thought then will lead to bad feelings, especially if you repeat it. So if you can see that thought coming up, things are not good at all, then you can go back and revisit that. You can change that story to, well, it's good enough right now. So an example would be that all that machine over there has a guard off, and that if somebody sticks their hand in that machine while it's running, they're going to damage their skin, maybe chew their arm off. Okay, so the point is, is that right now we do not have to go and change that guard on that machine, the right thing to do right now is not put your hand in it. That you can do that later. Right now we're saying, okay, I note or I see that machine with its guard off. That's okay. Right now it's okay. We don't have to go put the guard on the machine. Now, at a later time, we could put the guard on the machine, or we could turn the machine off. It doesn't matter one way or the other. The best thing to do is to not put your hand in the machine. But if you are already engaged with that machine, then the best thing to do with wisdom is to put the guard back on that mechanism of the machine so that people can't put their hand in it. So if you're already engaged with that machine, that's the time to put the guard on. But while you're just sitting, then there's no reason to. Okay, now the next point would be that probably if you're sitting in practicing Anapanasati, you're probably nowhere near that machine. You're probably sitting in a meditation hall, in the woods, in the forest, under a tree, sitting in an empty hut. And what we mean by an empty hut is it's free from machines. So what I'm really getting at, I'll tell you in the form of a story. And the story is called Refrigerator Door. There the guy is sitting in meditation, and a thought comes Oh, I may have left the refrigerator door open, and the next thing you know, next thing this meditator knows, he's standing in front of the refrigerator with the door open, and he wasn't even aware of the fact that he had a thought about the refrigerator door. So in the other example that we were using, having a thought of that machine without its guard It's just another thought while we're sitting quietly in seclusion. There's no reason to. You can say, oh, I'll fix that guard later. I don't have to have bad feelings or the feeling of danger now. We can change that story right now. So Ivan, do you have any questions so far about this?

**Speaker C:** I know I have a question, but not sure how to phrase it. When I know how to phrase it, I will ask. Not right now.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Santiago, do you have something to say?

**Speaker A:** Nope, sounds good.

**Speaker B:** How about you, Alex?

**Speaker A:** No, everything sounds wonderful. I like it.

**Speaker B:** Okay, how about you, Paul?

**Speaker D:** Sounds good.

**Speaker B:** How about you, Luke?

**Speaker D:** All good here, thanks, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** Okay, and Ben, how about you? I saw you turn the microphone on and then off again, but I didn't hear you.

**Speaker A:** Question, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** I'm just riding a scooter.

**Speaker B:** At the minute. Just what? Riding the scooter, so it's not really conducive to talking. Oh, okay. All right, so I've covered all of the old students. This information that we're talking about today is fairly detailed. Dhamma Das, do you have anything to say?

**Speaker A:** No, thank you. Thank you for the talk.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so let's go back then and say a little bit more about practice. That basically the practice is to sit quietly and start observing the thoughts that we have. That instead of having this outside sense door, we're going to start paying attention to the inside door, or we can begin to look at what kind of thoughts that we're having. We can also look at the feelings that we have. We can actually, if we have a little skill, you can begin to see the attitude that you have. Now, what I mean by attitude is the attitude, is everything okay? Is everything well enough? Or is the attitude of, oh no, there's a problem someplace and I've got to go find a way of fixing that problem. And so it has to do then, our attitude has to do with what way we're looking at things, because our attitude is going to determine what kind of story that we're going to tell ourselves about it. And when we stop telling ourselves stories, that's the end of the story, is to stop telling ourselves stories. But very few people are ready for that. That takes a lot of skill, that what we actually need to do is to start changing our ordinary thoughts into better thoughts, from unwholesome to wholesome. Another way of saying it is to remove the hindrances of the mind, and the hindrances are that which hinders us from feeling really good, no matter what happens, whether it's the teacher yelling or the test that we failed or whatever it is. Another example that I saw recently is somebody says that my dad threw a beer mug across the room at me and that he missed. Okay, that's the important story, is that he missed. But the student didn't catch that. He didn't catch that it was missed. He was all upset because the dad threw the mug. So it depends then upon what part of the story you want to dwell on. And the important point is, is can you find a happy way of the story? Goenka had the phrase, never mind, start again. Whatever story you told yourself, tell yourself a better story. Don't get all stuck up in bad feelings about the story that you told. Tell yourself a better story. Gather better information. Look and look and look and look. So the guy only looked enough to see Dad throwing a beer mug. He didn't continue to look. He was already feeling bad before he even got hit. And he didn't get hit, but that didn't make it into his story. His story is, "Dad's throwing a beer mug at me." And then he's making up a big story about that, about how Dad feels. He doesn't even know how Dad feels. Maybe Dad's trying to teach him how to play baseball using beer mugs. You don't know how Dad feels. But we make up stories about how Dad feels, and we make up those stories when the mug is in midair. Before it even lands, we're making up stories about it and feeling bad already, and then carrying those bad feelings around long enough to get on the Discord about it. No mindfulness, no Sati. So we can in fact then start to train the mind to keep looking and keep looking and recognize that, hey, the beer mug missed, I'm okay. Or if the beer mug lands, never mind, we'll be ready for the next beer mug. So you can always change the story. And this is the point that we want to reach, is that you have control, complete control over the story that you're telling yourself. You also have, by being able to change the story, you have complete control over the way that you feel. If you feel bad, change the story, and then you can feel good about the story. So that's basically all the story, not much to it. If you're sharp. And so then the question is, when can you practice so that you can do this? Now, one of the discussions that's there would be the discussion about the difference between practicing whenever you can think about practicing versus having a formal sitting. To sit down and intentionally practice, and that we can do both of these things. A lot of people think that sitting down and doing formal meditation is all there is, and you should sit a long time, 1 hour a day, 2 hours a day, 3 hours a day. But if you're sitting an hour a day, what that means is that you're probably in hindrance the other 23. So it's better to start a practice to where you're actually practicing often, but that often will only be to a certain level or to a certain degree. In other words, you can begin to practice while you're walking around to see the way that you're making stuff up, but to actually— actually, sorry, I meant that, uh, I'm mistaken that you can begin to see how you feel about the story. But in order to actually see the way that you're making the stories up, to be able to see with wisdom the point of perception, we need to sit for a fairly long time to get the mind very quiet so that you can see the storytelling mechanism. That when we're walking around in ordinary life, about the best we're going to be able to do is to see how we feel before we act on it. But even that, you'll see that ordinary people, they'll have a bad feeling about what they're reading on Discord, and immediately they're talking, typing in how bad they feel about what they're reading. And that I would recommend for everybody then is before you post on Discord or any other social media to think about it before you type it, to recognize that you have control over what you type. A lot of people don't. A lot of people don't see that they've got control over what they type. They feel bad and they've got to type how bad they feel rather than slowing down, taking the deep breath and begin to change the story so that we can begin to change the way that we feel. But to be able to see the storytelling itself and how the storytelling is done, the mind needs to be really, really quiet. This is where the formal practice comes in, but we don't even have to.

**Speaker A:** Use the word formal.

**Speaker B:** What we can do is use the word seclusion for a long time. An example would be a camera. Back in the old days, in fact, when cameras were brand new, the film was very slow. They used silver nitrate on a plate, and in order to get a good exposure, they had to open the lens for a fairly long time out in the sunlight. And that's why people had to stay really, really still. But as cameras improved, high-speed film comes out, and now we can see things in action. So we now can take that and put it as the way that the mind works. Most people are not actually watching what's really, really happening. They're very slow. But if we can get the mind very, very quiet, very settled, that's like putting the camera on a tripod so that we can see very clearly. And as we gain the skill at that, we can begin to see more clearly how things are happening, even though we're not sitting as still as we were. Okay, so what we're meaning is, is that to be able to see what's happening in the mind requires skill that has to be developed. So let's start practicing now. Somebody asked for a bit of a guided meditation. Are we ready for that? All right, so whether you close your eyes or not is up to you. I don't care, but it's sometimes better to let the eyes go off into either a gaze having the eyes what they call half closed and just looking down, or you can close the eyes altogether. And then to start off, we're going.

**Speaker A:** To take a deep breath and relax. And as we're relaxing, think of it as going down, down, down. Or another way of saying that, we're turning the volume down. We're letting things get settled, easy and quiet, so that we're beginning to focus not on what we're thinking but on the sound of the voice.

**Speaker B:** We're not going to be making up.

**Speaker A:** Any stories other than the story that we're talking about of just settling down and getting quiet, getting rested.

**Speaker B:** So as we imagine this, imagine yourself.

**Speaker A:** In an elevator, just going down, down, down from the 9th floor to the 8th floor. We can relax a bit. And from the 8th floor to the 7th floor, and take a deep breath and relax. And from the 7th floor, we're going down deeper into the 6th floor, then down to the 5th. And as we're relaxing more and more, we can just feel really good for a moment. Everything is okay, everything is quiet. Then we go down to the 5th floor, then to the 4th floor. Things are getting very relaxed, very easy, very comfortable. You can check your body to make sure that the body is comfortable and you can relax. Down to the fourth, then to the third, down to the first floor. And then as the elevator door opens, we step out into a very beautiful place. Everything is okay. Everything is quiet. No machines around, nothing to do, and no place to go. And so we can take a deep breath and just relax. Everything is fine. Not a care in the world. Now the question is, can we keep that? Let's just try to rest with that. You're okay right now. Everything is okay. Everything is quiet. And so these are the kind of.

**Speaker B:** Thoughts that we're going to have.

**Speaker A:** Everything is okay. Everything is easygoing. We can relax. And if the mind wanders away, never mind, start again. I'm back. Come back. Everything is okay. Everything is easygoing. No place to go. Nothing to do. Everything just be okay. Take another deep breath. Just relax. If the mind wanders away, never mind. Just keep coming back. Wherever the mind is going to, you can catch that and say, right now everything is all right. In fact, what we're doing is we're gladdening the mind. We can see that there's nothing to think about, nothing to worry about. There's nothing dangerous. Everything is okay right now. If you're comfortable If the mind wanders away, never mind, we're all right. Let it wander just enough to see it, then come back. We're in control of the mind. We can become easygoing. We can become glad. We can brighten the mind. In fact, we can become satisfied. Everything is okay right now. Everything is all right. Not a problem, not a care in the world. We can keep practicing that If the mind wanders away, never mind. Come back. Come back to here now with the thought everything is okay, not a problem in the world. We could just relax, relax and feel good. We can actually begin to change the way that we feel. By changing our thoughts, we can change our attitude, and with our attitude, we can change the way we feel so that you can feel good. Everything is okay. Not a problem in the world. Everything is all right. So we can come around to, you know, I could do this. I could do this. Anytime that I sit down, I can settle down, I can become relaxed, I can become successful at this, I could become satisfied. Then I can become successful. Wow, this actually feels good. I could do this. Everything is all right. Not a problem in the world, and I'm in charge of that world. I can do it. I'm the boss here. It feels so good to finally be in control of the way we feel. Ah, what a relaxing it is. Everything is all right. Everything is fine. And so as we are doing this, we don't have to do anything else. Don't have to play with the computer or fiddle around. We can just relax. Stay relaxed. Everything is all right. Not a problem in the world. We can rest with this, feel good. And as we stay here feeling good, we can begin to come back again. We can finish this little exercise off, but keep that good feeling going. Keeping that sense of we've got this. Keep that sense of everything is okay and everything is all right, because that's my attitude right now. And so we can begin to come back a bit. Come back, get into that elevator, begin to just ascend back into ordinary senses. So we get on the ground floor and we come up to the first, second, third, up to the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth floors.

**Speaker B:** And that's the door to open to reality.

**Speaker A:** So now you can open your eyes.

**Speaker B:** Take a deep breath, and say, wow, I feel so good.

**Speaker A:** I feel good. So this is the way that you would practice. You might be able to take this recording and play it several times, but eventually you can make this practice your own practice.

**Speaker B:** So, Ivan, what do you think?

**Speaker A:** Perfect.

**Speaker C:** Really simple.

**Speaker A:** Very simple, isn't it?

**Speaker B:** How do you feel?

**Speaker E:** I'm great.

**Speaker A:** I feel like a winner.

**Speaker B:** So Luke, what do you think? How do you feel right now?

**Speaker D:** Yeah, really good. Thanks, Dhammarato. That was nice.

**Speaker B:** All right, Nick, how do you feel right now? Not a care in the world.

**Speaker A:** Excellent.

**Speaker B:** Santiago, how do you feel right now? Like a Valium pill without the Valium. Alex, how do you feel?

**Speaker A:** Very good. Everything's okay. Everything is okay. How about you, Dhamma Dude? Dhamma Dasha?

**Speaker B:** Thank you so much.

**Speaker A:** That was relaxing. You can do this anytime that you want to.

**Speaker B:** How about you, Paul? What do you think?

**Speaker D:** Joyful.

**Speaker B:** All right. How about Snippy Muffin?

**Speaker A:** What do you think?

**Speaker B:** I feel good, relieved.

**Speaker A:** Good one. So Arjun, how are you feeling now? I'm feeling good.

**Speaker B:** How about Dhammarato? How do you feel?

**Speaker A:** Good, thank you so much. Okay, all right.

**Speaker B:** Does anybody have any comments, any questions?

**Speaker D:** I was just thinking, Dhammarato, reflecting on— you were saying about changing the story, changing our story. And I was thinking about parenting. I've got two, yeah, pretty much teenage kids at the moment. And I'm always reflecting on how much as a parent, we have this expectation of how our children should behave. And what, you know, what they, how they should act around other people. And, and anytime they do something that we perceive to not be, you know, what we expect, it's a reflection on me. And I'm just trying to think about how I can change that story, because it causes me a lot of suffering. So, yeah, I'm just saying, yeah, that's just something for me to think about.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, if you think about it like this, your only choice is to let them choose their own Dukkha or not. Or are you going to intentionally add to it?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** I'm very, I'm very lucky that their, their mother's very.

**Speaker A:** Good at being.

**Speaker D:** Able to kind of just let them be who they are, whereas I was brought up— I wouldn't say I was brought up really strictly, but my parents were quite particular about— and I guess that sort of carried into me. So I have to be really mindful to try and to make sure I'm not sort of always criticizing them and always, you know.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, what you can do is begin to tell yourself the story that, gosh, these kids are really okay, and I'm really pleased that they're okay, and therefore they don't need me to hassle them so much. An example of that would be many parents don't want their kids to play with the cell phone, to play games, or to talk to their friends. So you're not going to be able to prevent your kids from playing on the cell phone, but you can make them feel guilty because they do. Yeah, and actually you can't make them feel guilty, but you want to make them feel guilty. You're saying thou shalt not. You become your own version of the Ten Commandments.

**Speaker A:** And they will, will accept.

**Speaker B:** Or reject that as they, uh, uh, please. However, they don't have the skills that we're training for here, that most kids have no skills and therefore have no.

**Speaker A:** Control over the way that they feel.

**Speaker B:** And so they often will respond with rebellion. One dad asked me about, well, how can you get the kid to clean his room? And my answer to that was Does the kid want to clean his room, or do you want to clean his room, or do you want him to clean his room? And one of the ways that you can get the room clean because you know it is you can go in and clean the room yourself. But another way of doing it, because that's pretty hard for most dads— most dads are going to grumble while they're cleaning the room.

**Speaker A:** But they can't clean the room happily.

**Speaker B:** And so the kid winds up with.

**Speaker A:** That kind of feeling also.

**Speaker B:** Even if Dad cleans up the room, we're still left with bad feelings. So it wasn't the room at all.

**Speaker A:** It was the feelings.

**Speaker B:** So one of the ways that you can handle that is by going and getting some big bag, maybe a grocery bag, maybe a big plastic trash bag. Maybe you can get a tub or a bin or something like that. And go play basketball with your son, and you're holding that bag and maybe moving it around and saying, okay, can you get that toy into this bag and make a game out of it so that you can begin to enjoy your time with your son while the room is getting picked up? Okay, so with that as an example, we can take that to almost anywhere. And make anything into a game. And kids like games. Some of you are still kids, and you know that you like the games. So let's make a game out of everything that we do.

**Speaker A:** If cleaning the room is the thing.

**Speaker B:** Let'S play with it, my friend. Uh, will make songs to sing with her kids about doing like different chores.

**Speaker D:** Or, you know, eating, eating dinner or whatever, which is really interesting and it works really well for her. Yeah, they do that at my kids' school. When, when they were young, they did that at school. They would— the teachers would sing certain songs when it was cleaning up time and stuff. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** There's an old, old movie. It was a Disney movie. I think it was like 1951 or 1952 called Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the original movie, not the one that they've come up with recently.

**Speaker A:** I don't know what's in that other than there's a lot of controversy about it.

**Speaker B:** But the original, there was a song that we can whistle while we work. Okay, so we can actually get stuff done But we can sing a song, we can whistle, we can make it playful. Whatever you do, make it joyful. Now the point is that we need to practice because humans, big humans like us, are in such a bad habit about being not joyful. We want the kid to clean his room and we're not joyful about that at all. And so we impart our disliking, our bad feelings, etc. We originally wanted to clean the room or get the room clean, and we wind up having a whole bunch of bad feelings, and so does the kid. And in fact, that's how you were probably all raised, was being raised by feeling bad is the important thing. And doing the job is secondary. And so we can train with this practice of Anapanasati that we've just gone through, just a little of it. And when you get yourself then into a good mood, then you can go to your kids and be very playful about what you want them to do so that they can do it happily. You can begin to train them to be happy. Picking it up from you.

**Speaker D:** Thank you, that's good.

**Speaker B:** So Santiago, do you have anything to say?

**Speaker A:** Nothing.

**Speaker B:** I mean, I just— not clean that room. I mean, part of the reason why somebody wouldn't clean the room Because it gets clean for them. This is just like, here you go, this is why we clean rooms. Yeah, it's cleaning up and then not worry about it no more. Okay, Snippy Muffin, I noticed that you're turning your mic on and off. Do you have something to say?

**Speaker A:** I turned my mic off because I was opening a squeaky door. But no, I just appreciate the call. Also, you touched on formal practice in a way that answered some of my questions before.

**Speaker B:** Excellent. All right. All right. So does anybody have any last things to say before we finish?

**Speaker A:** Thanks, everybody. Thank you, Dhammarato. Thank you.

**Speaker D:** Thanks, guys.

**Speaker B:** All right, why don't you take it from here?

**Speaker E:** Yeah, thanks, friends, for being here today. This has been a splendid call. I'm glad to see smiling friends. Go ahead and put down a day and time in the one-on-one calls thread here on Discord if you'd like to do a one-on-one call with a seasoned practitioner. This is for friends old and new. So if you're an old friend and you haven't had a one-on-one call with someone in a while, go ahead and put a time there. We've been making a lot of friends. Prajna, the Bhikkhu, he's also been doing one-on-one calls. He told me he did something like 7 one-on-one calls last week. So things have been really going there. And Yeah, it's a great way to keep the Sangha going. So yeah, have a good one, everyone. Thank you for being here today.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** One last point is that we have.

**Speaker A:** A very big and growing Facebook page called Open Sangha.

**Speaker B:** So I invite you to go do some posting there as well as on Discord. And we also have a website, opensanghafoundation.org, that has a way of posting things. So if you have a thought or a sutta or something that you want.

**Speaker A:** To post for the long term, because.

**Speaker B:** On Discord you post it and it.

**Speaker A:** Scrolls way up, but with the website.

**Speaker B:** You have the ability to find things easy. Find posts by the author or the date. You can find comments in the comment section.

**Speaker A:** Everything is organized there, uh, so I highly recommend that, uh, you use the website. It's got a lot of value.

**Speaker B:** Also, it's got a huge library. I mean, really a huge.

**Speaker A:** You can add to the library yourself.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, thank you all.

**Speaker A:** I'm really glad to see you.

**Speaker B:** Wow, what a good crowd today. Thank you.

**Speaker D:** Thanks, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye. Thank you.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato, centers on **how we process experience through "stories" and how to gain freedom from suffering by skillfully working with those stories.** Here is a structured summary:

### **Core Teaching: The Stories We Tell Ourselves**
The central idea is that we don't experience raw reality; we experience a **perceived reality**—a story we construct in our minds based on sensory input and past conditioning (Sankhara). This story directly determines our feelings and subsequent actions.

### **Key Points & Framework**

1.  **The Path of Dependent Origination (Paticcasamuppada):**
    *   The talk uses this Buddhist teaching to map the mind's process: **Contact** (sensory input) -> **Perception** (creating a story) -> **Feeling** -> **Clinging/Aversion** -> **Action** -> **Suffering (Dukkha)**.
    *   The earlier we intervene in this chain, the more freedom and less suffering we have.

2.  **Levels of Wisdom & Intervention:**
    *   **Wisdom at the Point of Dukkha:** Reacting after suffering has arisen (e.g., walking out and slamming a door during an argument). This is "a mile behind" and too late.
    *   **Wisdom at the Point of Feeling:** Noticing the feeling (pleasant/unpleasant) and choosing not to act from craving or aversion. Example: "I like it, but I don't want it" (Ajahn Sumedho's story).
    *   **Wisdom at the Point of Contact/Perception:** The most skillful. Seeing the initial story being constructed and **changing it before it generates painful feelings**. This requires a quiet, trained mind.

3.  **Practical Application: Changing the Story**
    *   We have **complete control** over the stories we tell and, therefore, over our feelings.
    *   **The Method:** When you feel bad, trace it back to the story you're telling yourself. Then, consciously **"tell yourself a better story."**
    *   **Example:** A father throws a beer mug and misses. The painful story is "My dad is attacking me." The better story is "He missed. I'm okay." Or even, "Maybe he's trying to teach me to dodge!"
    *   This is not denial, but wise re-framing that reduces suffering.

4.  **On Communication & Teaching Dhamma:**
    *   In response to Ivan's initial question, the advice is to **speak in the listener's language** (citing MN 139).
    *   Favor speaking about Dhamma in the abstract, using stories and similes, rather than making it personal.
    *   It's skillful to introduce "supramundane" (deep Dhamma) concepts and then guide the listener to understand them.

5.  **Formal Practice vs. Daily Life:**
    *   **Daily Mindfulness:** Practice noticing feelings and stories throughout the day. Pause before reacting, especially on social media.
    *   **Formal Seclusion (Meditation):** Essential for developing the deep quietude needed to see the **storytelling mechanism itself**—to perceive perception in action. This is like using a tripod for a clear, steady camera shot.

6.  **Guided Meditation (The "Elevator"):**
    *   A simple practice to cultivate the "everything is okay" story.
    *   Involves deep relaxation, mentally descending floors in an elevator to a place of peace, and repeatedly using the thought "**Everything is okay, not a problem in the world**" to gladden and calm the mind.
    *   The goal is to make this attitude of ease and control your default setting.

### **Illustrative Anecdotes**
*   **Refrigerator Door:** A meditator has a fleeting thought about an open fridge, and without awareness, finds himself standing in front of it. This shows how unconscious stories drive action.
*   **Cleaning the Room:** A parenting example. Instead of creating conflict by demanding a clean room, turn it into a joyful game. The real goal isn't just a clean room, but **maintaining wholesome feelings** for both parent and child.

### **Overall Message**
**Suffering is optional.** It arises from the unexamined stories we habitually tell ourselves. Through practice—both in daily life and in quiet seclusion—we can learn to see these stories as they form and rewrite them. This grants us mastery over our inner world, leading to peace and happiness regardless of external conditions. The ultimate skill is to **stop telling stories altogether** and rest in emptiness (Sunyata), where mere sensory input doesn't trigger a reactive narrative.

**Ending:** The talk concludes with practical Sangha information and encouragement to use available resources (Discord, website, one-on-one calls) to continue the practice.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several **metaphors, analogies, and stories** to explain Buddhist concepts, particularly about perception, feeling, and mindful practice. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Metaphors & Analogies**
1. **Computer Boot-Up Process**  
   Used to explain *Paticcasamuppada* (dependent origination):  
   > “To get a computer turned on, you have to have power… one step after another. Any place along the chain that is broken will affect the procedure.”

2. **Camera Analogy**  
   Explains the need for a quiet mind to see mental processes clearly:  
   > “Back in the old days… film was very slow… they had to open the lens for a fairly long time… But as cameras improved, high-speed film comes out, and now we can see things in action… Most people are not actually watching what's really happening. They're very slow. But if we can get the mind very quiet… that's like putting the camera on a tripod.”

3. **Machine Guard**  
   Used to illustrate how to handle potentially dangerous thoughts without immediate reaction:  
   > “That machine over there has a guard off… The best thing to do right now is not put your hand in it… You can say, ‘Oh, I’ll fix that guard later.’”

4. **Elevator Descent**  
   A guided meditation metaphor for deepening relaxation:  
   > “Imagine yourself in an elevator, just going down, down, down from the 9th floor to the 8th floor… down to the first floor… step out into a very beautiful place.”

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1. **Ajahn Sumedho and Ajahn Chah at the Kathina Ceremony**  
   A story about wisdom at the point of feeling:  
   > Ajahn Chah points out young ladies in fine dress. Ajahn Sumedho says, *“I like it, but I don’t want it.”* This illustrates recognizing a feeling without letting it lead to craving.

2. **The Man Slamming the Door After an Argument**  
   An example of unskillful, late reaction—*“wisdom at the point of Dukkha”*:  
   > He says something he regrets, feels bad, and slams the door on the way out. “That’s wisdom at the point of Dukkha. Pretty late.”

3. **The Refrigerator Door**  
   A story about how thoughts can unconsciously propel action:  
   > A meditator thinks, *“Oh, I may have left the refrigerator door open,”* and the next thing he knows, he’s standing in front of the open fridge without even being aware of deciding to go there.

4. **Dad Throwing a Beer Mug**  
   Used to show how we fixate on one part of a story and create suffering:  
   > The student focused on *“Dad threw a beer mug at me”* but didn’t include *“he missed”* in his story. The lesson: we can choose which parts of the story to emphasize to change our feelings.

5. **Cleaning the Room as a Game**  
   A parenting anecdote to illustrate bringing joy to chores:  
   > Instead of nagging a child to clean, turn it into a game of “basketball” with a trash bag. The point: *“Whatever you do, make it joyful.”*

### **Key Themes Through Metaphors/Stories**
- **We live in “stories”** we tell ourselves, not in raw reality.
- **We can change our feelings by changing our internal narrative.**
- **Wisdom can intervene at different points** in the perceptual process (contact, feeling, craving, etc.).
- **Formal meditation is like a tripod for the mind**—it stabilizes attention so we can see our mental processes clearly.
- **Teaching should use the listener’s language** and often metaphors (as the Buddha did) to avoid rubbing truths in too directly.

These metaphors and stories make abstract Buddhist psychology (*Paticcasamuppada*, *Satipatthana*, *Sunyata*) accessible and practical for daily life.
