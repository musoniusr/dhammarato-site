### Transcript


**Speaker A:** This is Saturday morning in Thailand. It's time for the call, 9 AM Thai time. We do all the calls on Discord, and so you can check our group, The Dhamma Dude or Dhamma Friends, for when we're scheduling calls. We've got quite a lot of them now. So today we're going to start with talking about basically about motivation and what are noble motivations. And I would start off by using the Triple Gem itself. As our motivation. That ordinary people will find ordinary things for motivation, like banking or jobs or grocery stores or all kinds of things in the sense of what I want. And so our wantings and our desires then become a motivation. But at the noble level, it would be wise then to say that what our motivations would be would be the Triple Gem in the sense of Buddha, Dharma, Sangha. What does that mean? It means that we're going to be motivated to spend most of our time, or all of our time in fact, instead of being motivated by ordinary things, we're going to be motivated by the Triple Gem. And that the first item would be Buddha, would be the motivation to make sure right now at this moment that your mind is clean, that it is not obstructed, that it is not hindered and that, um, uh, the mind is paying attention, awake. That's what the word bodhi actually means. It means to be awake, to be here now, to be paying attention. Nothing magical about it. That in fact, if you want a magical Buddha, see that as your motivation, that you want a magical— you want something special. Rather than being quite satisfied with what you have right here, right now, which is good enough. So that would be the first motivation, the motivation to have your mind pure, clean, clear, free from obstructions, free from hindrances. And that's in fact With that, no unwholesome thoughts. The thoughts become wholesome. And with that wholesomeness, that means we're also able to have the correct attitude. And a good correct attitude would be, in fact, that we don't really need anything.

**Speaker B:** Our motivation has already gotten what we need. Which is to have that bright, clear.

**Speaker A:** Pure mind to see things the way that they are. And that actually brings up joy automatically, in the sense that when we do not feel any fear because we're not obstructed or hindered by fears and doubts.

**Speaker B:** Then that means that we have safety.

**Speaker A:** And security, that you feel safe and secure in the moment.

**Speaker B:** The second part of that then would.

**Speaker A:** Also mean that you feel comfortable.

**Speaker B:** From there you feel satisfied. Okay, so when we have safety, security.

**Speaker A:** Comfort, and satisfaction, that then would be the Pali word Sukkha.

**Speaker B:** Now Sukkha actually is exactly opposite of Dukkha. So having and being in a state of Sukkha, being in the state of.

**Speaker A:** Being safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied, is.

**Speaker B:** Really all the Buddha teaches. And so this would be the motivation, is to be able to get into that state. Now the second motivation would be the Dharma, and that is that the only topic that's really worth talking about and thinking about is the Dhamma, which is actually this teaching that we're talking about. Getting one's mind straightened out means that there's not really much to think about except how nice it is. This is great. And that we got here by changing the mind out of Dukkha into a state of Sukkha. And so by being in that state, we could also call that state first Jhana because it has all the qualities.

**Speaker A:** Of the first Jhana of being safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied. We apply the mind to that, we keep the mind sustained in that state.

**Speaker B:** And so long as we can sustain that state, it has the result of being satisfied. Everything is okay. Now, from time to time, we will.

**Speaker A:** Reflect upon that and.

**Speaker B:** Come up with sort of a wow feeling, a wow sensation. Wow, this is so good. Wow, everything is all right. And that wow sensation then would be the next point, which we, Piti, The Pali word Piti actually indicates a wow state or a really feeling good state, the state of having a really excellent attitude of everything is all right, not a problem in the world. So this would be the motivation then of being in that kind of state where you don't want anything. And so some people would say, well, what about enlightenment? And the point would be that when you're satisfied, when everything is already okay in a really kind of marvelous way, who needs magical enlightenment? Which would you rather have? Would you want to be magically enlightened and still not satisfied? Or would you be satisfied and not give a flying rip about what is enlightenment?

**Speaker A:** Enlightenment.

**Speaker B:** But in fact, the best kind of enlightenment is something that you don't even need. It's too heavy. So when we are actually free of enlightenment, that means that we actually are light.

**Speaker A:** And so you can give up any.

**Speaker B:** Ideas or imaginations about far away goals, that the goal is here now, right in the present This is it. That's the motivation for the Dhamma. Now the Sangha would come third in.

**Speaker A:** The sense that, wow, this is so.

**Speaker B:** Great, I can't wait to share it.

**Speaker A:** With my friends, my noble friends. And then that would be then the.

**Speaker B:** Idea with us, is either we're communicating with our noble friends that are close.

**Speaker A:** By, or we can go to an online place where we can find noble friends. That's what this Dhamma Friends Discord group is for.

**Speaker B:** It's for you to come and find noble friends so that that fulfills that.

**Speaker A:** Third of the Triple Gem, the Sangha.

**Speaker B:** And that it's possibly the most important.

**Speaker A:** In the sense for especially beginners is.

**Speaker B:** To rely upon those noble friends to.

**Speaker A:** Help you to remember to keep coming back to being in a really, really marvelous state of mind.

**Speaker B:** There's not really that much to it. Motivations are easy. This is where you would come to. Uh, Jonesy, you had a question about this. Is that what you were, um, asking? What is your worst motivation? The only motivation would be is to be happy, wholesome, and friendly.

**Speaker C:** So how would you recommend someone who is at a point where they feel like they don't have a lot of motivations other than to spend time in the Dharma, but is not necessarily like artistically inclined, let's say, like a lot of people here share really gorgeous artwork and gorgeous poetry. And a lot of practice logs and like about where they've come as far as cleaning the mind of wholesome thoughts. If you have someone who is mostly just drifting through thoughts as it is, or not having very many, like doing a lot of focusing on the breath, how would you recommend that they interact with the Sangha? Or like, where do you think that person, especially if they're a layperson, where should they get their motivations beyond like eating before noon? Like, how would they decide what to do during their day aside from quote unquote chores, which are rare, truly?

**Speaker B:** Well, the first thing you mentioned was about activities. And that would be any activity like working, or let us say studying to be an engineer at university, or anything like that, would be that when obstructions to that come to mind, to be able to see those instructions, that would be our obstructions. That would be the motivation, is to live with a mind that is not obstructed. So, uh, in a way you can say then that there's no more work, that almost always when we use the word work, we're talking about doing something with some resistance involved. It becomes work because we're putting in resistance to doing it. And so a job to do would be a job because we're putting in resistance. However, if there's no resistance, then the job becomes easy. So we would then, uh, kind of using the English language to make some changes to, uh, the way that we speak to ourselves, unwholesome and things like that. You can say that the word job and work, uh, and, uh, Strenuous effort, striving, all of those kind of words can be changed to the word play. Become playful. Enjoy what you're doing. So if you're an artist painting, then the way that you would paint would be by enjoying doing the work. Enjoy arranging your paint colors. Enjoy cleaning your brushes. Enjoy getting ready with the canvas, and then enjoy figuring out what you're going to paint. And then with joy, with happiness, with playfulness, do your artwork. The same thing would be when you're studying, if you're a student. Then do that also with joy. For instance, when you're in class.

**Speaker D:** With.

**Speaker B:** The teacher, enjoy your communication with the teacher. When the teacher is asking the class something and you know the answer, then joyfully you say, yeah, I know the answer. And if you don't, you sit there joyfully willing to learn what the teacher is asking. They probably are asking a question that.

**Speaker E:** Nobody knows the answer to, so that.

**Speaker B:** That can be a learning situation. So everything in that regard can become playful. Now, some people want to say, oh well, I can't study now because of lack of opportunity, lack of books, or whatever like that. And the answer to that would be that we can, over time, get ready. For instance, if you want to study electronics as a child, take apart old televisions, take apart old radios, figure out.

**Speaker E:** What'S going on with it.

**Speaker B:** You can always get the opportunity to play with that which you want to do. As you're the engineer, after you've gotten your degree and in the work situation, because you have been learning and training with joy and playfulness, then that means that your job can be joyful, it can be playful. An example of that would be someone who works at NASA.

**Speaker E:** They can enjoy their job, or they.

**Speaker B:** Can, um, let us say, work at it.

**Speaker E:** It's always a choice, and the choice.

**Speaker B:** Would always be to be joyful, be pleasurable, be happy at whatever job or whatever occupation that you have, even if your job is at McDonald's. Whatever the job is, you can turn it into a joy. You can turn it into a pleasure. So, Jonesy, that's the way that we can talk about it, is that whatever your hand findeth to do, do it with all thy— in the sutra, in the Bible, that talks all your strength, all your mind, all your spirit, all that kind of stuff, which is basically just ways of saying, put yourself into it in the sense that this is enjoyable. Whatever you're going to do, do it with pleasure. So, nothing— Thank you very much. Go ahead.

**Speaker C:** That's it, just thank you.

**Speaker B:** All right, so this is the way that we would do anything. We would deal with our friends with pleasure, make everything light. Nothing is heavy. The Dharma, in fact, is not heavy, it's light. Almost all of the Dharma, in fact, can be said in one line. The Dhamma is in fact very simple, and it all can be said in one line. For instance, the Buddha said that the only thing that he teaches, both formally and now, is Dukkha, Nirodha. See the Dukkha, see your own dissatisfaction, and change that dissatisfaction into satisfaction. There's really nothing to it. So that means you— Yes, go ahead.

**Speaker F:** So if there is something like— Yeah, I'm a new person here. Just on the same thing you were saying, if there is something that I'm doing but I don't want to do it, I don't like to do it, like I don't want to be an engineer but I'm an engineer and doing that work, Then can I still make myself like it?

**Speaker B:** Well, it's your choice. You decided to not like it, and we decided to not like stuff when we were children.

**Speaker E:** But in fact, childhood is the place.

**Speaker B:** Where we get the worst kind of training because we don't recognize that we've got a choice. Mommy says, do your homework. Go to school, and the child wants.

**Speaker E:** To do something else.

**Speaker B:** And so they resent and resist what it is that they're supposed to do. And we begin to train ourselves like that. That the much better way of doing it would be for Mommy to say, wow, we're going to have a great day at school, everything's going to be.

**Speaker E:** Really great today at school. And then little Johnny picks up that that happiness, that joy from Mommy, and.

**Speaker B:** Off to school he goes. Unfortunately, when he gets there, now he's in a class that's full of people who are not happy, not joyful about being in school. And so Johnny has to remember, oh, I can be happy and joyful in class even though all the other children.

**Speaker E:** And the teacher don't really want to be there.

**Speaker B:** And so they force themselves to be there. Their motivation is basically the motivation that.

**Speaker E:** Comes out of fear, of remorse, fear of retribution.

**Speaker B:** And when we can live our life that's free from fear— fear of remorse.

**Speaker E:** Fear of feeling sorry, fear of retribution—.

**Speaker B:** Then we can just enjoy our lives. However, that's very difficult to do when all the other engineers in your department are there because they need the job. And so you can actually help motivate them by being joyful about what the project is. You can ask them joyful questions. You can bring them out of their ordinary state of mind But that takes a skill, and the place to develop that skill is around the noble friends.

**Speaker E:** And so by staying focused with the.

**Speaker B:** Dharma, by staying focused with having a clear mind, and by staying focused with having joyful, happy friends in your own noble Sangha, that will then help you develop the skills so that you can go out into the world of ordinary unhappy people. We didn't have that kind of skill when we were in the first grade, and so we went along to get along. Everybody here is miserable. The only thing that's really good about school is recess, and so, um, we.

**Speaker E:** Can go out on the recess ground.

**Speaker B:** Get our joy, and then come back into class, uh, joyful. And then stay joyful, stay happy, stay relaxed. But we have to practice that.

**Speaker E:** I don't even understand why our society.

**Speaker B:** Has gotten itself into the state that it is, that everything is miserable, everything has to do with motivations based upon greed, when we can have motivations based upon joy and pleasure of doing, being active.

**Speaker E:** And so.

**Speaker B:** Now that we've trained ourselves.

**Speaker E:** Over the years of being unhappy moment.

**Speaker B:** By moment, we now have to practice being joyful moment by moment. Now, for some reason in the West, we have gotten the attitude about Western Buddhism that Western Buddhism has actually now become a business.

**Speaker E:** I think part of the reason why.

**Speaker B:** That happened was because of the influence that Goenka had. And Goenka was a businessman, and he taught his style of meditation in a very business-like manner. And so all of the students wind up learning that kind of meditation in the sense that there are goals, there are efforts that you have to put in, there is strong determination, there is all kinds of stuff. So in a way, much of the practice of meditation in the West, it's just ordinary. It's not noble at all.

**Speaker E:** And it takes quite a lot of effort.

**Speaker B:** Right, noble, easygoing effort to change that model from being in, let us say, a life that's filled with struggles trying to gain something, into the attitude that, hey, we've already got everything we need, there's no reason to struggle. A lot of people say, well, I lack direction in life. Well, guess what? If you're already at the destination, then there's no place to go. You don't need any direction. You've already there. And so this is what we're actually cultivating, is the attitude that we've already arrived, that there's no place to go, that there is really nothing to do other than enjoying life. That's all there is. And yet religion Western Buddhism and much of Buddhism doesn't follow that. They have the ordinary people's attitude that there is work to do. There is something to do. Oh, I've got to work at it. Oh, I've got to prove that I'm working at it. In fact, one of the worst qualities of that would be the driver. And I'll talk about drivers in just a moment, but the worst of the drivers is the one that's called try-hard. What is the try-hard driver? That means that already the attitude is an attitude of failure, but I don't want to just give up because the teacher or whoever wouldn't like that I've just given up and I'm a failure. So what we do is we put in wrong effort. We're trying to prove that I'm trying even though I expect to fail. I'm trying even though I expect to fail. If we can change that mental attitude of I don't have to try at this, I can just have fun at it. That if I'm having fun at it, that that means already I've changed the attitude from being a failure into being a winner. And so I can do that over and over again. We can apply that, by the way, to whether the child is learning how to play baseball. Instead of working really hard and trying really hard, we can just have fun at it. The same thing is true with learning to play the piano, that most of the people who take piano lessons quit within a couple of years because they haven't learned that really important point of stop trying to get it right and start enjoying what you're doing. That's really all there is to it. So now that you're an engineer and you've been trained like all of the other engineers is to work hard not like your job, complain and moan. We can begin to change that attitude into, hey, we're having fun here. There is no such thing as failure. All failure is an attitude. All success is an attitude. Now that's a really important one-liner right there. If you can get that, if you can experience it that way, that whatever you do, see it as a success. You might have this goal and you only get this far. At least examine that. Well, you've gotten that far, isn't that great?

**Speaker G:** This is our Sangha call. Quite a lot of people.

**Speaker B:** Sorry, what was that? Who was that talking? Was that Daniel?

**Speaker G:** Hello, Dhammarato. Sorry, I I wasn't muted, but enjoying to listen now.

**Speaker B:** All right, I'm glad to see you. That's another example right there about being a monk. Congratulations, Daniel, you're coming up to about 1 year, right? A lot of people, they become a monk for many reasons. One of the reasons in Thailand is family pressure. The question is, can you in fact enjoy whatever you're doing? But that was one of the problems that I had when I was first a monk, is that I thought that I had to really work hard to being a monk. And it took me quite a while to change that attitude of, hey, I've got nothing to do. And no place to go. I can hang out in the forest. I can enjoy every moment, moment by moment, with no responsibilities to other people. Now, when we gain that attitude, when we're out in seclusion, we can then bring that to the front of the wat, which means coming around to noble people where everybody already has that attitude of, hey, things are already really great. There's no place to go, nothing to do. We're just having having fun here together. And then we can leave the wat and go out into the world and keep that attitude of everything is okay, not a problem in the world, that we have a goal but we're only going towards that goal of, let us say, getting the old truck running. So let's play with just having the old truck running. But the most important part of the job of getting the the old truck running is that we're enjoying playing with getting the old truck running. Not that, oh, I've got to feel bad until I get the old truck running. That we can have fun every moment, every step along whatever path that we're on. Each moment of that path can be a joyful success. So if you have any questions about this, it doesn't take very long. Uh, what is our motivation? Our motivation is we're having fun here. So Bhante Yago, what do you think?

**Speaker H:** I think it's good to have fun.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we have to be reminded of this because it really is so simple to fall back into, oh, that there's a lot of work here. That we have to remember that I don't have to work at this. I could just have fun here. I could get some help here. And the help that we need is not to feel good. The help that we need is maybe figuring out the directions of what Google is saying. I have— I've seen over and over again, Google gives you a long list of directions, and someplace in there you can't do that direction. Because they've changed the software and they didn't change the directions for it. Well, never mind. Let's just have fun figuring out what you're talking about. No problem here, no worries, everything is all right. It's when we develop that sense of I don't like to do this, and we develop that as a child, we develop the attitude of being a loser, we develop the attitude of being a victim. As a child, we see adults much bigger than we.

**Speaker E:** As a child, we see, um, that.

**Speaker B:** They'Re big and strong and powerful, and I'm, I'm nothing. And so when those big, strong, powerful people show you how unhappy they are, you figure that that's the way you got to do it. You got to have a life of struggle because your mommy struggles. And so we have been trained to be unhappy. So now it's time to train our mind into becoming happy again. Now, Santiago, you asked a question about the Satipatthana.

**Speaker H:** Yeah, how to be constantly in Sati. Because, you know, a lot of these things require that one be looking. If one is not looking, one cannot do any of these things. One is just swept away by whatever is going on automatically that you're choosing not to pay attention to.

**Speaker B:** So, yes, that's okay. So let's look at it from the sense of automatic, the automatic pilot. Let's use the example of an airplane, a big airliner, that they have now trained those autopilots to where their autopilot is working really, really well. But in fact, the mentality is, is that when the airplane is on automatic pilot there's almost never any collision. The problem is that the pilot has to be wise in the sense of knowing when to turn the automatic pilot off.

**Speaker E:** Let us say the automatic pilot has.

**Speaker B:** Automatically taken the airplane right into the.

**Speaker E:** Side of a mountain.

**Speaker B:** That means that the autopilot is wrong.

**Speaker E:** And so we have to turn off the autopilot and start flying the plane with mindfulness, with looking at where we're.

**Speaker B:** Going and making the right effort to go in the right direction. Well, guess what? In the really, really old days, there.

**Speaker E:** Was no such thing as autopilot.

**Speaker B:** We had to steer everything. Now, when we were not trained well.

**Speaker E:** That means that as we grew up.

**Speaker B:** And started doing everything by habit, which.

**Speaker E:** Means doing things on automatic pilot, we.

**Speaker B:** Leave it on automatic pilot only to fly our life right into the side of a mountain over and over and over and over again. We do that because we're flying on automatic pilot. That's not well trained.

**Speaker E:** So what the real training then is.

**Speaker B:** Is to remember to come out of automatic pilot, to come out of our habits, because our habits were trained to be unhappy.

**Speaker E:** And start retraining the autopilot to go in the right direction, to do things correctly. And so this is what the real question of practice is all about, is practicing mainly, number one, is to look, to be able to see where things are headed, to see things, how things are going right now. Now, the problem with looking is that.

**Speaker B:** We don't remember to look.

**Speaker E:** That we just left things on automatic pilot, and then the real pilot, your frontal cortex, is taking a nap, not looking. And therefore we fly our plane right into the side of a mountain of bad feelings. So what do we mean then by the word Sati? The word Sati is translated in English into modern Western Buddhism as mindfulness, and.

**Speaker B:** In a way that misses the point. Because it doesn't— it's in fact mindfulness has a whole lot closer value of looking without the real important point of remembering to look, to watch where we're going, to make sure that our automatic pilot is in fact operating correctly instead.

**Speaker E:** Of just on automatic pilot. Because automatic pilot doesn't see the birds.

**Speaker B:** In the air, it doesn't see the.

**Speaker E:** Thunderstorms, it doesn't see what's going on.

**Speaker B:** It doesn't even see the other aircraft. It's just on a straight course.

**Speaker E:** And so we learn that straight course.

**Speaker B:** Of do whatever you do but hate.

**Speaker E:** It, because that's how we learned to operate in school.

**Speaker B:** In fact, the students who make the.

**Speaker E:** Best grades are the ones who actually.

**Speaker B:** Enjoy what they're doing.

**Speaker E:** And so that would be mostly the job of the teacher, is to encourage students to enjoy what they're doing, as opposed to making sure that they're doing.

**Speaker B:** It correctly no matter how bad they feel. So if we can come out of automatic pilot. What that means then is Sati. Sati means to remember, to come out of automatic pilot, remember to take a.

**Speaker E:** Good look at really what's going on. Because only by seeing correctly what's really going on do we have any opportunity to make changes, to make course corrections.

**Speaker B:** Right here, right now.

**Speaker E:** So what is then Satipatthana? Satipatthana means to remember, to look at the four foundations. The four foundations of Sati would be then the practice. This is in fact why Anapanasati has.

**Speaker B:** All four of these foundations, to where.

**Speaker E:** The word Ana, Panna actually means in and out breathing. And so people get the idea that the meditation is a breathing meditation rather than having it as, let's say, part of a package. So let's imagine then that back to that airplane, that there are various things that the pilot can do in the cockpit. He can steer the plane, he can push the gas up and down, he can communicate with the land-based air traffic controllers, he can do a whole lot of stuff.

**Speaker B:** And we can do that same thing.

**Speaker E:** In our practice rather than just one thing. That in fact, there are four foundations of mindfulness. And so by practicing Anapanasati correctly, that.

**Speaker B:** Means that we're practicing all four of.

**Speaker E:** The foundations for mindfulness. So the mindfulness then is number one, to remember to look at what the body's doing. And we start that, but only at the beginning do we start with looking at how you're breathing. And that's always the best place to start, to look at whether you're taking easygoing breaths, whether you're starving yourself because you're in a state of freeze.

**Speaker B:** If you're not breathing well, then in.

**Speaker E:** Fact we've gotten ourselves into the habit of not breathing very well because we've never been taught to pay attention to.

**Speaker B:** It and to breathe correctly.

**Speaker E:** This is one of the main reasons why people are tired when they get up in the morning, is because they have been on automatic pilot for their breathing all night. And they never trained their automatic pilot to breathe correctly. So what we're going to start practicing is breathing correctly. And when we keep practicing breathing correctly, it becomes part of the automatic pilot system. But we have to train. And so the way to train is to remember Sati, to take a deep, long, easy breath. To take it in long, deep, and easy. And when we breathe out, we breathe out in a relaxed way. But that's only one of the, of the four. But as we progress with that breathing, we begin then to relax the body. We begin to see, get knowledge of the body. We begin to understand what the body is doing. That one of the practices that we can do is to start watching what your hands are doing. Almost always people don't pay attention to what their hands are doing. And so in conversation— in fact, it was a television show way, way long ago, kind of a variety show, where the people in the audience would come up and be asked questions about their partner. And I remember one in particular.

**Speaker B:** The.

**Speaker E:** Question was asked to the woman, "When your husband talks, does he use his hands?" And one of the jokes about it was that Italians use their hand gestures a lot. Why? Because they were trained to do that. So can you train yourself to watch what your hands are doing when you're listening, when you're talking, when you're doing stuff? Notice that if you've got your hands up to your face, notice that your hands are stable, especially when we're grasping, reaching, whatever the body is doing. Become mindful of what the body is doing. Begin to watch what the body is doing. And the fourth step of Anapanasati is actually the important one, that we're watching our breathing and we're watching what the body is doing only to the point of making sure that the body is relaxed. It is not uptight, it's not tense, it's not worried. That everything is cool, everything is easygoing. And that's only one of the four foundations of mindfulness. Now, there is a correct order in this, in the sense of in the old, old system of elements in the.

**Speaker B:** Time of the Buddha.

**Speaker E:** Now we have 92 elements and counting. But in the time of the Buddha, they had only 4 elements, and that those 4 elements in the time of the Buddha was solid, liquid, air, and temperature, or fire.

**Speaker B:** Those were the 4 elements, and the.

**Speaker E:** Buddha used that not on the outside but to bring that on the inside and look at the body not from the outside but look at the body from the sense of the inside. An example of that is when you're holding something, most of the time we're paying attention to the object that we're holding as opposed to paying attention to the hand position and the touch and.

**Speaker B:** The feel of the object.

**Speaker E:** So changing that from an outside to an inside awareness is basically what the practice of Anapanasati is. Is looking at the body from the inside. So we can do that from the beginning, or we can take the— another.

**Speaker B:** Object would be to look at what.

**Speaker E:** The thoughts that you have, recognizing that our thoughts are almost always on automatic pilot. 99% of the thoughts that you've ever had you've had those thoughts serially over and over and over and over again. It's like instead of being a serial murderer, we're a serial thinker, and we keep thinking the same things over and over and over again without actually paying attention to the things that we're thinking. This is time to have some different kind of thinking, because most of the thinking that we have is thinking about how to solve a problem thinking about, worrying about things that need to be done, thinking about things that wind up keeping us in doubt, keeping us worried, keeping us restless, keeping us in a state of desire, etc., like that. So if we can start looking at what we're thinking, then we have a choice as to what kind of thoughts we're thinking. We can come out of unwholesome thoughts and start having wholesome thoughts. We need to retrain that automatic pilot that thinks in a habit system and start interrupting those habits to start having the thoughts of everything is okay, everything is fine, no problems here. We've already arrived. The destination is right here, right now. That's the only place to go. Is right here, right now. We've already gotten there. The job that needed to be done has just been done when we're in the present. When we're looking at the Satipatthana like this, we can see that the thoughts that we have are the thoughts of habit, or they're the thoughts of awareness. So by doing that, we can also begin to— what is in the sutras about Anapanasati is called gladdening the mind.

**Speaker B:** And people will say, well, wait a.

**Speaker E:** Minute, what does gladdening the mind have to do with Anapanasati? And the answer to that is maybe the word Anapanasati, mindfulness of our breathing, is also mindfulness of the fact that the mind is going up and down, in and out, over and over again, just like the breathing is. And we can begin to control the attitude of the mind by brightening the mind, gladdening the mind, changing those unwholesome thoughts into wholesome thoughts. Now, uh, that also means that we're beginning to change the state of mind that we're in. So we can change our thoughts, and the thoughts then will change the state of mind. And what state that we're in? We're normally in the state of mind of being a loser, being a sucker, being in a state of working hard.

**Speaker B:** Trying.

**Speaker E:** Hard, rather than having the state of mind of, "This is a piece of cake. This is easy. Not a problem in the world." We've already arrived. So if we can begin to control our thoughts and changing the thoughts from unwholesome to wholesome, we can also change our mental state from unwholesome to wholesome states of mind. If we can change our mind from unwholesome states to wholesome states, that also means that we can change our feelings. We can change our feelings from being a feeling of fear, which is the normal state that we're in. We're trained that way. In fact, that's how humans got started. Humans would not have survived if they didn't pay attention to their fear. But our modern society means that our fear mechanism is working too much. We're in a state of fear almost all the time because we put ourselves in the state of the habit of fear. So we can train to come out of fear, train. In fact, by gladdening the mind and changing our attitude, we can change our feeling from the state of fear into the state of safety and security. Now, the fear actually is a foundational feeling in the sense that all of the negative emotions that we have are based in fear. For instance, when we get angry, there's always a sense of loss, a sense of something is wrong here, which means that it's got fear at the base. Anxiety, frustration, sadness, Grief, despair, all of those things have a basis in fear, fear of loss. But we can change that. We can change that by changing our attitude, and we can change our attitude by changing our thoughts. One thought at a time, over and over and over again, is like retraining that automatic pilot.

**Speaker B:** So that we.

**Speaker E:** Can remember to gladden the mind, to become joyful. You can remember to change that attitude of, oh, this is hard, oh, this is too much for me, into the attitude of, hey, this is easy, I'm having fun here. Then we can change the feelings from the feeling of being fearful into the feeling of being safe, being secure. Only when we're safe and secure and comfortable are we able to bring the mind into a state of satisfaction, and satisfaction then is the basis of joy. Wow, this is great! Everything is okay. So these are the four foundations of mindfulness, and these are to be practice, to be rehearsed, to build the skills. What are the skills of the Satipatthana? That the body is relaxed, that the feelings are feelings of satisfied, that the attitude of the mind is that of a winner, and that the thoughts, the fourth one, is that the thoughts are wholesome. And we keep practicing this over and over and over.

**Speaker B:** Again.

**Speaker E:** So Santiago, do you have any questions about the.

**Speaker H:** Satipatthana? Yeah, thank you very much. I appreciate.

**Speaker B:** It.

**Speaker E:** Okay, RJ, what do you.

**Speaker F:** Think? Oh yeah, this is very interesting. I think I understood it to some extent. Like, there is one part body that I watch and change it, whatever is wrong. Then there is thoughts, unwholesome thoughts to wholesome thoughts. And the state of mind, if I understood correctly, that will happen. Like, if I fix the thoughts, the state of mind will change from loser to winner, and You know, from things are very hard to things are very easy. And the fourth one, I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker E:** We have basically the order. If you can remember the order and the external would be solid, liquid. The solid is the body. The liquid is our feelings. The fire is the fire of the mind, our attitude. And then, uh, the— depending upon the fire, the smoke.

**Speaker B:** So, um, the smoke is actually the.

**Speaker E:** Words that we have or the thoughts that we have. Now, if the fire is hot, if it's got a— if you've got a good fire, then there's not much.

**Speaker B:** Smoke. And you can think of them as the wood that we put in would be the fuel for the fire, and the fuel for the fire then would be the feelings. So we can go for the analogy.

**Speaker E:** Of a pot-bellied stove. The stove itself, the iron cast stove, is the body, and the wood that we put in there— if we put in wet wood, if we put in wood that's got moss on it then the fire is going to not burn very well. And then it depends upon the flu of the exhaust of the smoke. And so how we actually operate it then is look at the smoke, look at the kind of thoughts that we have so that we can adjust the fire to make it hot. And by making the fire hot, that means that it can consume various kinds of.

**Speaker D:** Fuel.

**Speaker E:** But then we want to start selecting the fuel to put in, to put in happy fuel, to put in dry wood rather than moss-covered, dank wood. All right, so this is how you can remember the Satipatthana. Is a pipe village stove with the wood, the fuel, the fire itself, and then the smoke or the.

**Speaker B:** Output.

**Speaker E:** If we can remember it that way, then it's very easy then to say, oh, well, we have then to look at all four of these.

**Speaker A:** Elements.

**Speaker E:** We can adjust the smoke by adjusting the body. We can adjust the thoughts by adjusting the fuel. We can take a rod and go in and poke around inside the fire, poke around to change it so that we can control the way that the fire works. Okay, so this is actually the Satipatthana, and this is also the basis for the practice we call Anapanasati. But it's not just the breathing, it's not just the body itself, but it's also all four of these.

**Speaker B:** Things.

**Speaker E:** So, Dhammarato, do you have anything to add to.

**Speaker B:** This? Nope.

**Speaker D:** Thank you, though. I have a few questions just to make sure I understand the four pillars of mindfulness. So the body, would you consider that the five.

**Speaker B:** Senses?

**Speaker D:** Yes.

**Speaker E:** The five senses are built right into the body.

**Speaker D:** Okay. So there's the body, the emotions, like the water. Or like the feelings, you said. There's the thoughts, like the mental images, mental chatter, which is the third one. I don't quite understand the smoke or the.

**Speaker B:** Air.

**Speaker D:** I think that was the same question.

**Speaker E:** That's the thoughts. That's the thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker E:** And the third one then is the attitude, the fire itself. What is the mind? Okay, the mind itself is either the mind of a poor fire, would be a struggle. It would be an attitude of being a victim. An example of that would be when you're at work, if you don't like the work, if you're not having fun, that means that the fire itself is not good. It's a dank fire. It's not hot. But when we're playful, when we're enjoying what we're doing, that means that the fire is appropriate. It's a hot fire. It's an attitude, a can-do attitude, as opposed to a struggling attitude. So the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, again, to make sure, is the body, the feelings, the attitude, and the state of mind that we're in. And then the fourth one is our thought process, the content of the mind. That's where I get the word smoke, is from the thoughts that we put.

**Speaker D:** Out.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so.

**Speaker D:** Um, The attitude is sort of like the state you're in. It could be a happy attitude. It could be at an unhappy, seeing everything as bad. It's sort of like your state. Okay, that makes sense. I appreciate your explanation.

**Speaker E:** Okay, great. So let's see, Eddie, what do you have to.

**Speaker C:** Say?

**Speaker E:** All right, so I'd like to take this opportunity now to turn things over to Pra Daniel and to Mikey. They have an announcement to make. And I'll let them deal with that now. So go.

**Speaker B:** Ahead.

**Speaker G:** Hey, Dhammarato. Yes, sir, I can.

**Speaker E:** All right, I would like for you then to go ahead and mention what we've got on mind.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, so, uh, basically about 3 weeks, uh, 3 weeks ago, I approached.

**Speaker C:** Mikey.

**Speaker G:** Um, if he wanted to sell my bike, my motorbike. So 2 years ago, before I was a monk, I was doing a lot of retreats on Koh Phangan, on Koh Samui. And so I bought a bike to go to the retreats and just, yeah, for like general usage. And when I left to ordain as a monk, I thought like, oh, I don't need the money right now anyway, so yeah, I'll just leave it on.

**Speaker B:** Khao Pha.

**Speaker G:** Nang and Scott, Katal, and Mikey, among others, have used it. And Yeah, now basically my friends are living in my house in the Netherlands, and I need to do some renovations to a moldy bathroom, so I need to sell the bike to pay for that renovation. And yeah, since I asked Mikey if he could sell the bike, but he kind of needs it to go to school and to go to the Watts, etc. Yeah, Dhammarato, Mikey, and I thought it would be a good idea to see if we could maybe raise the funds to buy the bike to OSF, which is convenient for me as well because then, yeah, there's no need to sell it. We can just transfer it to OSF, and in this way, like anyone in the future who comes to the islands can make use of the bike. And Mikey, who has of course been helping OSF greatly, can continue to use the bike, which he also needs for his visa as he is on like an education visa. And yeah, he needs to go to school to keep that visa. So I bought the bike 2 years ago I think it was like 40 or 50,000 baht.

**Speaker B:** I don't remember.

**Speaker G:** It was at least 40. So we figured it has depreciated quite a bit, and we think it's worth about $900 now. And, um, yeah, so that's, uh, what we're, um, seeing if we can raise that through OSF. Um, yeah, so that's basically it. If Dhammarato or Mikey wants to add anything else, then go ahead.

**Speaker E:** Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Mikey.

**Speaker I:** Yeah, I'll post the link in the chat if any of y'all would like to donate. For you all watching this on YouTube or listening on podcast, the link is opensanghafoundation.org/new-site/dhamma. And yeah, we'll have the link posted here and on YouTube as well if you'd like to share it or go and donate thereafter. But you can do that after the Sangha call.

**Speaker B:** So.

**Speaker I:** Yeah, let me keep pushing, Mikey. One thing I did want to mention is that if we do end up raising more than $900 for the bike, currently we have somewhere in the ballpark of $300 raised just since yesterday, which is really happy to see that. Yes, thank you, Deidre, for your donation as well. But if we do end up raising more than $900, the remainder of that money will just be saved for bike repairs, gasoline, and things of that nature and related to the bike. So if you could, when you make your donation, just say for OSF bike or for Prod Daniels bike, this sort of thing. So that way we know where the money is to go. But yeah, go ahead with your question, Amit.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think you already answered it. So we have to mention it's for.

**Speaker J:** The bike, and then that's how you will figure out.

**Speaker I:** Yes, yes indeed.

**Speaker C:** Thank you.

**Speaker E:** Thanks.

**Speaker J:** Okay, so— Can I add something? It might be easy for people to have a PayPal account. If you don't have that, And you have to do it via credit card. It's also possible.

**Speaker E:** Actually, that's right. When you— I would like to reiterate that, that actually the easy way to do it is to go to the opensanghafoundation.org, and every page has a footer that has the clickable item called a dana. And when you click that, it'll open the dana page, and I would like and invite everybody to read that Donna page and also see the video. And someplace on the page is actually a clickable item for PayPal. And when that comes up, uh, the, uh, the best way to do it is actually through a credit card. If you have a credit or a debit card and you pay for it with that, then all of the funds are transferred. But if you pay for it with other ways, like through a PayPal or whatever, then there there's always a fee. But if you translate it, or if you pay for it through a credit card or a debit card, the entire amount is transferred to Open Sangha Foundation. So also, I would like to add about Open Sangha Foundation that part of the reason for having Open Sangha Foundation, including the website, is to assist people in their spiritual journey, especially giving information and also financial support. And that we've had a long list of people that we've done some financial support also. Luckily, Pra Daniel was already self-sufficient, and so he was able to self-finance. But now that he's gotten into the situation that he's in now, feel free that we're able to actually not only donate to helping him, but also for the long term to help other people. We've helped Kat and Kamma Situ and Eric all have ordained through our help and assistance. Plus, we've also helped some lay people. For instance, Mikey, we're giving him support, and Mikey's been quite instrumental in getting the website up and helping us with all kinds of things. As my health has deteriorated, we're counting on more and more volunteers to do the work. And as Mikey said, already just in one day, we've already gotten $300. So if you can dig deep into your pocket and find another C-note, I think that we can put this thing.

**Speaker B:** To rest pretty, pretty soon. So thank you all. Mikey, can you wrap this.

**Speaker A:** Up?

**Speaker I:** Yeah, the mind is the forerunner. So let's have wholesome thoughts and take it easy and be friendly with one another and be friendly with ourselves. Thank you, friends, for being here today. This has been a splendid Dhamma call. Take.

**Speaker C:** Care.

**Speaker E:** Thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, Santiago. We'll see you.


### Summary

Based on the provided transcript, here is a summary of the Dhamma talk led by Dhammarato (Speaker B, the primary teacher) with Sangha friends:

### **Core Theme: Noble Motivation & The Joyful Path**

The talk centers on shifting from ordinary, struggle-based motivations to noble, joyful ones rooted in the Triple Gem (Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha). The essence of the practice is to cultivate a happy, satisfied mind in the present moment, seeing this as the true goal rather than a distant, "magical" enlightenment.

**1. Motivation Based on the Triple Gem:**
*   **Buddha:** The motivation is to have a mind that is **clean, clear, awake, and unobstructed** in the present moment. This state naturally brings safety, security, comfort, and satisfaction (*Sukkha*), the opposite of suffering (*Dukkha*).
*   **Dhamma:** The motivation is to sustain this state of *Sukkha* and make it the primary topic of reflection. When truly satisfied, the question of "enlightenment" becomes irrelevant—the goal is already here. The Dhamma is simple: see dissatisfaction and change it to satisfaction.
*   **Sangha:** The motivation is to **share this joyful state with noble friends** and rely on their support, especially for beginners, to remember and return to this wholesome mind state. Communities like the Dhamma Friends Discord serve this purpose.

**2. Applying Joy to Daily Life:**
*   The key instruction is to transform all activities—work, study, chores, art—from being "work" (done with resistance) into **"play"** (done with joy and ease).
*   Examples were given: an artist enjoying the process, a student engaging joyfully in class, or an engineer bringing a playful attitude to projects. Success or failure is reframed as a matter of **attitude**.
*   Childhood conditioning often trains us to resist and dislike tasks. The practice is to retrain the mind to choose joy, moment by moment.

**3. Satipatthana (The Four Foundations of Mindfulness) - The "How-To":**
*   The practice is framed as **training the mind's "autopilot."** Our habitual autopilot leads to suffering; mindfulness (*Sati*) means remembering to "look" and make course corrections.
*   Using the analogy of a **pot-bellied stove**, the four foundations are explained interactively:
    *   **Body (The Stove):** Start by watching and relaxing the body, especially the breath. Train it to be calm and comfortable.
    *   **Feelings (The Fuel):** Be aware of feelings. Choose to "feed the fire" with satisfying, joyful feelings instead of fearful, negative ones.
    *   **Mind/Attitude (The Fire):** Cultivate a "hot," **can-do, winning attitude** ("This is easy, I'm having fun") instead of a "dank," struggling, victim mentality.
    *   **Mental Contents/Thoughts (The Smoke):** Observe thoughts. Actively change unwholesome, repetitive thoughts into wholesome ones (e.g., "Everything is okay").
*   The practice of *Ānāpānasati* (mindfulness of breathing) incorporates all four foundations—it's not just about breath, but about using the breath to gladden the mind and adjust all these elements.

**4. Key Takeaways & Attitude Shift:**
*   **The Path is Light:** True Dhamma is not heavy, strenuous, or goal-oriented in a striving way. It's about **lightness, ease, and playfulness**.
*   **You've Already Arrived:** The destination is the present moment of satisfaction. There's nowhere else to go.
*   **Retrain Your Habits:** Life has trained us in unhappiness and fear. The practice is the conscious, joyful retraining of the mind's habits and autopilot toward sustained *Sukkha*.

**5. Sangha Announcement (Conclusion):**
*   The talk concluded with a practical Sangha matter: a fundraiser for the Open Sangha Foundation to purchase a motorbike for community use on the Thai islands, supporting both a monk's needs and lay helpers.

**In essence, the talk was an invitation to abandon the model of Buddhism as a grim, striving business and to embrace it as a joyful, moment-to-moment practice of purifying the mind, finding satisfaction in the present, and sharing that ease with a community of friends.**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on your transcript, the talk uses several core metaphors and illustrative stories to explain the Dhamma (teaching). Here is a breakdown:

### **Core Metaphors**

1.  **The Triple Gem as a Compass for Motivation:** The central framework is that our motivations should be aligned with the **Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha**, not ordinary worldly desires. This isn't just a list but a map for practice:
    *   **Buddha:** Motivated to have a mind that is "clean, clear, awake" like the word *bodhi* (awakening). It's portrayed as "nothing magical," just pure, present-moment attention.
    *   **Dhamma:** Motivated to dwell in and talk about the state of *Sukkha* (ease, satisfaction), which is the direct opposite of *Dukkha* (suffering, dissatisfaction).
    *   **Sangha:** Motivated to share this joyful state with "noble friends" and rely on them for support, exemplified by the Discord group itself.

2.  **Sukkha as a Safe Harbor:** *Sukkha* is metaphorically described as a state of **"safety, security, comfort, and satisfaction."** This is contrasted with the fear and obstruction of *Dukkha*. The goal is framed not as a distant "magical enlightenment," but as abiding in this present-moment satisfaction where "everything is already okay."

3.  **Work vs. Play:** A powerful metaphor contrasts the conventional view of **work/job/striving** (associated with resistance, burden, and "try-hard" effort) with **play** (associated with joy, ease, and natural engagement). The instruction is to transform all activity—studying, engineering, even a job at McDonald's—into playful, enjoyable action.

4.  **The Mind as an Airplane on Autopilot:** This is a key metaphor for explaining mindfulness (*Sati*).
    *   **Autopilot:** Represents our **habitual, untrained mind** that runs on patterns of unhappiness, fear, and unwholesome thoughts, often leading us "right into the side of a mountain" of suffering.
    *   **The Pilot (Frontal Cortex):** Represents **awareness** or **Sati**. The practice is to "wake up the pilot," turn off the faulty autopilot, and manually correct the course with mindful attention.
    *   **Course Correction:** The act of shifting from unwholesome to wholesome thoughts and attitudes.

5.  **The Four Elements / Pot-Bellied Stove:** This metaphor explains the **Four Foundations of Mindfulness (*Satipatthana*)**:
    *   **The Stove (Body):** The physical container (like the earth/solid element).
    *   **The Fuel (Feelings):** The raw material we feed into it (like the water/liquid element). Are we putting in "dry wood" (pleasant, wholesome feelings) or "wet, moss-covered wood" (unpleasant, unwholesome feelings)?
    *   **The Fire (Mind/Attitude):** The state of the mind itself (like the fire element). Is it a "dank," struggling fire (victim attitude) or a "hot," capable fire (playful, "can-do" attitude)?
    *   **The Smoke (Thoughts):** The output and content of the mind (like the air element). Wholesome thoughts are like clean smoke; unwholesome thoughts are like thick, choking smoke. You adjust one element (e.g., the fuel/feelings) to affect the others (the fire/attitude and smoke/thoughts).

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Child in School:** Used to illustrate how we are trained into unhappiness. A child learns to see school as a miserable obligation ("the only thing that's really good about school is recess") due to the unhappy attitudes of teachers and peers. This conditions a life of motivation based on fear and resistance.

2.  **The Engineer in a Grumbling Office:** A story for a lay practitioner. It describes an engineer surrounded by colleagues who complain and work only for a paycheck. The challenge (and skill to develop) is to maintain your own joyful, playful attitude and potentially inspire others, rather than being pulled back into the collective "ordinary unhappy" mindset.

3.  **The Monk's Realization:** Speaker B (**Dhammarato**) shares a brief personal story about his early days as a monk. He thought he had to "work hard" at being a monk until he realized the attitude should be, **"I've got nothing to do and no place to go. I can hang out in the forest... enjoy every moment."** This story encapsulates the shift from striving to joyful abiding.

4.  **Learning Piano or Baseball:** Used to illustrate the "try-hard" vs. "play" metaphor. Most people quit piano because they focus on "trying to get it right" instead of "enjoying what you're doing." The same applies to a child learning baseball—it should be fun, not a grim effort.

5.  **Fixing an Old Truck:** A simple, concrete example of applying the "playful" attitude to a mundane task. The goal is to get the truck running, but **"the most important part... is that we're enjoying playing with getting the old truck running,"** not feeling bad until it's done.

### **Summary**
The talk uses the **Autopilot metaphor** to explain the problem (an untrained, habitual mind) and the **Work-to-Play metaphor** to describe the solution (a shift in attitude). The **Four Elements/Stove metaphor** provides a practical model for mindfulness practice. The **stories** (the child, the engineer, the monk) ground these metaphors in relatable life experiences, showing how to move from motivation based on fear and lack to motivation based on the joyful satisfaction (*Sukkha*) of the Triple Gem.
