### Transcript


**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] So, David, you're right, and that in fact every one of us who gets into the Dharma begins to ask those kinds of questions that we're talking about now. Right? And if you think about it, You're doing exactly the same thing by saying, well, maybe I can leave this world and go off and be an Arhat. And when we have those kinds of thoughts, that's also planning for the future, right? Instead of saying, oh, well, let me have my little what right here in this breath, right?

**Speaker B:** I have, and I have, and I'm content, like I find the contentment wherever I am, but I still feel like, do I, like, no moment is better than another moment. I see that.

**Speaker A:** Like, it depends upon how we feel about it, but it does have to do with our feelings.

**Speaker B:** It does have to do with our feelings.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Everything's the same except the way we feel about it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and how I feel is that I need to take a break from the bombardment of stuff. That is Anicca.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right. I understand that. That in fact I could also say that everybody has those kind of feelings from time to time, whether they're in the Dharma, whether they're in church, or whether in the atheism, or whatever it is. We all get the idea of let's go make a great big change. Let's change schools, let's change cities, let's change jobs, let's change houses, let's change countries. 'Let's go off and be a part of the Bhikkhu Sangha,' something like that.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And that those are the feelings that need to be examined as feelings rather than pursued as thoughts about how to get rid of those feelings. Let's dwell on— let's look at those feelings directly. And in fact, everybody who goes that route leaves their job, packs up all of their gear, gives it away, comes to Thailand, ordains as a monk, and then they have those same kind of feelings which gives rise to new thoughts, but it's the same kind of thoughts anyway. Well, maybe I should leave this temple and go to that temple over there. I hear that that's a famous monk, or maybe I'm in the wrong country. I need to go to Tibet or to India or something like that, right? And the best thing to do is to examine the feelings that we have of wanting to go and wanting to stay. This is actually part of the fetters that the Buddha talks about. Let's make a big change. If I make a big change in my life for the better, then the circumstances will do all the work for me. What I'm recommending that you look at is changing the circumstances is not going to change the way that you feel. Changing the way you feel is the only way to change the way you feel. And when you make that change and change the way that you feel, now you can make these decisions you're talking about wisely.

**Speaker B:** Change the way I feel.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, change the way that you feel about things are not good enough, that you're not keeping up with the world, etc., like that.

**Speaker B:** I feel pretty good, but I have been— I've been doing the worldly thing for years now, and I've been happy doing that. Yeah, and I just don't see it as an avenue that—.

**Speaker A:** Ah, you're beginning to recognize there is no fulfillment there.

**Speaker B:** There's no, right.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Or you probably heard me quote the famous saying that's in the line drawing at Wat Suan Mokkh. Boundless joy to find at last there is no happiness in that world. No, you're finding that it does not fulfill. No. Mm-hmm. That the fulfillment is going to be on the inside of your own mind, and the best way to find that fulfillment is to be around others who have found that fulfillment.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And if you're around a bunch of people who are wanting and greed and I got to get this and I got to get that, then that's how we will normally feel. Yeah, because that's part of the environment and part of the flow. So there is great value in changing your environment, but we have to be careful about that because the changing in the environment is not necessarily going to change the way that you feel. So in a way, you got to do both of them.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I realize that changing the environment is not going to change how I feel. How I feel— I change how I feel.

**Speaker A:** You can change how you feel, right? And so here you are sitting, maybe I should change my environment, and look at that and say, well, how do I feel right now? What is it that I don't like about that world out there, knowing that it's not going to give any joy? This is all part of the package where the Buddha talks about the action that brings the end of actions. The Anicca will prevent you from taking the actions of going getting something that you think will make you content. And if you're already content, then why bother doing any of that stuff?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, why bother do anything? I could just keep going like I am, though, changing my environment.

**Speaker A:** So may I ask, where do you live?

**Speaker B:** I live in Ontario, Canada.

**Speaker A:** Ontario. Okay, there should be places in Canada, uh, that, that you can travel to, wats or whatever like that. And I would recommend to students to go to the nearest wat rather than going halfway around the world to a wat.

**Speaker B:** I have— I, I do that actually, uh On the weekend I go to different temples, different traditions. I went to one— there's only actually one Thai wat around. It's not really even a temple, really. It's actually not very active. It has one monk.

**Speaker A:** One monk. Okay, one monk does not Sangha make.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's not— that's actually.

**Speaker A:** Uh, but being around him would be probably a whole lot better than not being around him or anyone like him. So I would— yeah, if that's your choice, yes or no, then I would say yes, spend time there. But a larger wat with more monks would be better.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there's also a Tibetan place that I visit frequently on the weekend. It's in the Gelug tradition. It's the Dalai Lama's tradition. Yeah, it's pretty good there, but the resident He's not always in, but Stuart is just there giving courses. Yeah, I visit different centers, like some Zen centers, but I feel like I'm most attracted to There's even a Sri Lankan— there's at least 3 Sri Lankan temples around.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that sounds like a pretty good possibility. The problem with Tibet and Zen places is, is that you're unlikely to find Asians there. Of all of the Tibetan places that I know in the West, almost all of them have Westerners. And the same thing with the Zen. The Japanese are very unlikely to come to the United States for a whole variety of reasons. So staying with the Sri Lankans and the Thai, that kind of thing, because you're going to have real monks that have been trained. And so that's the first thing to consider. And actually, I have to admit that I know that there are nobles within the Tibetan culture, and there I know for sure that there are within the Sri Lankan community, that there are nobles that we can't say, "Oh, go to Thay because Thay is your best shot." that that's not necessarily the case at all.

**Speaker B:** It's not. What they're teaching though is not the noble Dharma, right? It's ordinary. Yeah. And I'm most attracted to the noble Dharma.

**Speaker A:** I know, but that doesn't mean that the noble Dharma is not available there. They're teaching according to what they think the students want and need. Yeah, maybe you could have this very conversation with one of the Sri Lankans in the sense of that I'm not really interested in traditional Buddhism, that you're actually interested in the noble Dharma taught by the Buddha and see what that is. Okay, you got to kind of make sure that they're clear on that because the monks have two different jobs. And that the bigger job is to take care of the lay people, and you're a lay guy, and so they assume that you're going to be just like all the other Sri Lankan lay people. But if you're wanting noble Dhamma, then you might find that if you ask the right questions. I've seen that happen several times, that you kind of think because of what this guy is teaching that he doesn't have a clue about the noble Dhamma, and that's not necessarily the case.

**Speaker B:** Hmm, could be a little bit risky bringing that up though. They might not take that as a— they might take it as like, you know, an offense, like they're not teaching the real Dharma or something, you know.

**Speaker A:** They know that. If they don't know that, then at least we know that now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But let us say it this way: Buddhism is like a jeweled case, a jeweled box, very ornate, and also has secret doors to it. And that this is the Buddhism of the world, it's the Buddhism of the West, it's the Buddhism of ordinary people. Very beautiful, very ornate, but it's got a hidden treasure inside. The monks generally know that that treasure is there on the inside, but they still talk to the people because of what the people want. They want the external, they want the magic, they want the hopes, the promises, etc., like that. And a lot of monks are like that also, that they didn't get around to noble teachers, and so they remained ordinary folks, that most of the Thai monks are ordinary people, but there are sufficient number of nobles around that it's worthwhile going looking. And I'm also saying that the nobility is also within the Sri Lankan. Actually, I don't have to go through the list. Every one of them have nobles, that in fact the Dalai Lama is absolutely, and clear to many, many people that he's noble. But my connection with the Dalai Lama is through Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. The Dalai Lama and Bhikkhu Buddhadasa were friends. We've even got a video of the two of them together where the Dalai Lama sees Bhikkhuni as his senior noble senior brother.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I read that somewhere. I have one of Mudita's books and yeah, it says, I think the Dalai Lama wrote like some summary of, like review. He said, he's like, Mudita was his spiritual brother.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so the way that it has traditionally been in all of the Buddhist cultures is the right student has to ask the right questions at the right time to the right senior monk. So that means then that you can go around asking the right questions to various monks to see which one of them is the right monk. And we have found so many noble monks in the West.

**Speaker B:** What are the questions to ask? Like, what's a good question?

**Speaker A:** Well, from Thai, man, the easiest question is, what about Bhikkhu Buddhadasa? And if the monk knows about Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, that's actually the door opener. Okay, in a more magical setting You could say, well, I'm not really interested in the distant future and the distant past the way that people who are interested in rebirth. I'm interested in right here, right now, how to be free from suffering, and see what kind of answer that question gets you.

**Speaker B:** Right, that's a good one.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's an easy question to ask.

**Speaker B:** The thing is, I feel like I'm.

**Speaker A:** Already.

**Speaker B:** Pretty much free of suffering. That's the thing.

**Speaker A:** Isn't that liberating? I mean, wow, what a relief it is. It is quite a relief it is to be free from that stuff, mostly. And that gives us then the possibility of, well, when it does come up again, I'll be there for it. I'll watch what's going on.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** And if you go through this with the various places, with that one Thai monk and the 2 or 3 places that are Sri Lankan, there's also Yamatharo, so I understand, is, uh, in Canada, but he's pretty close to New York. Which is not too far from Ottawa.

**Speaker B:** Yanathara?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, something like that.

**Speaker B:** Are you— you to Dhamma?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And if you exhaust all of those places, then there are places in the U.S. that I know of that you could go to. And you're most welcome to come sit here on the porch, settle out, because we've got so many retreat centers around here.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's kind of what I was thinking. I just want to dive in. I want to go to Asia. Because I want.

**Speaker A:** That. Oh, okay. Yeah. How close are you to a ticket? How close are you to, uh, packing up? Uh, this is just a pipe dream that might happen next year, or are you ready to pull the plug on this thing?

**Speaker B:** No, I'm ready. Like, I mean, I just I probably would like to go, and not this month or next month, but I think March.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Yeah, by then the tickets should be settled down back to a decent price. Right now they're outrageous because of holidays, I guess, but March would be a good time for to buy a ticket. Uh, so when you're ready to come, let me know and I'll walk you through and give you all the maps and photos and everything that you'll need to get around.

**Speaker B:** It's just like that, eh?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, just like that. You don't need a visa, just walks right in. You will need COVID, uh, certificate for saying that you've got the shots, and that's the only thing you need, and the passport, and you can get into Thailand.

**Speaker B:** What sort of visa would I need for that?

**Speaker A:** We'll worry about that later. Like I said, you don't need a visa to get in.

**Speaker B:** It's not a very long stay though.

**Speaker A:** If I don't— Well, yeah, but then that'll give you the chance to do what we do here. I mean, there's, there's very There are various possibilities. The one that most guys think of is that, "Oh, I can go get a job teaching," because we're still very much money-oriented. That in fact, when I actually did ordain, even weeks or even months before I ordained, I didn't need any money, not much, not the kind of way I actually learned to live that way. To just not need money very much. An example would be that anytime that I chose to go someplace, I would arrange the transportation to have a free night hotel accommodation, like taking a night bus or a night train or something like that. Then that would save a hotel. But hotels are so cheap here in Thailand anyway that that's not much of an issue. And depends upon what time of day that you arrive, that you can actually then get on the night bus and spend the night on the bus, and you never have to spend the night in a hotel. You can arrive here on the island and stay here at the house and get your orientation or whatnot. But in fact, Wat Khao Tum is only 2 kilometers from here. It's up on a hill. Big hill. And so it's really easy to walk down the hill to get to the house, but it's quite a trip to get back up to the wat. But there are no retreats being held there now, but there are two monks who were living there, and they'd love for you to come and stay as long as you want.

**Speaker B:** Wow. Yeah, that sounds great.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there's just so many possibilities for accommodations. And then the little bit that you will need, we can arrange for that. That's in fact what the Open Sangha Foundation is all about anyway, is to give people in the West the ability to donate so that we can support guys like you. Come and stay at the wat and give you the comfort and security that you need, that you can get your visas taken care of, etc., like that. And then if you ordain, we can help you do that too.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that sounds great.

**Speaker A:** Now you can go up and stay with Eric and Royette. I'm not familiar with them. Actually, the word Royette means 101. Roy is 100 and ette, so 101. Uh, it's a, it's a, it's a town, uh, that's north of Bangkok, up in the Isan area. And that's where, um, Eric is. He's already in the robes. He came in in August, and by October he was already in the robes. And so there's that place that you can go. And I also have another friend, his name is Kamma Situ, who is staying now at Wat Suan Mokkh, and he knows of an alternate way of doing ordinations. That for a while, the only way that I knew about ordinations was have to go to Wat Anapanasati, because that's the formal way of doing it. But there's many other— in fact, because that's the typical place for Westerners to go, that's a good enough reason to avoid that place and find a real Arahant like Bhikkhuni Santi in Royette and go there. So yes, this is all quite possible. There's really— it's a whole lot easier to do it than it is to think about it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it seems like that. It's a lot of options.

**Speaker A:** Right? Well, that's something that I can help you with and get you oriented, get you to the right place at the right time, and give you the right instructions. And it's up to you to do it. But yeah, sure, you're welcome to come stay on the porch here for a while.

**Speaker B:** That sounds fun. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** What kind of job do you have right now?

**Speaker B:** So I— the work I do is I inspect and I do repairs on fire alarm systems. Yeah, I work in Toronto.

**Speaker A:** I don't think you're going to find much of a job of doing that here in Thailand.

**Speaker B:** No. Yeah, I know. It's not a really popular job in the East. Well, developing countries. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, they do have cameras and stuff for surveillance and whatnot, but I don't know, I don't think I've ever seen a fire alarm here in Thailand. No industry.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, probably in Bangkok, they— I'm sure they have that in the— I'm sure they do. Yeah, high-rise. High-rise buildings. But financially, okay, actually right now I'm all right to just drop it and try something else.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you could try nothing. No, we got a whole lot of nothing here. You've heard that, that, uh, uh, the, the expression nothing's impossible?

**Speaker B:** Nothing's impossible.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, nothing is actually quite possible.

**Speaker B:** It is. I do a lot of nothing, actually.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, right, I'm pretty good at doing nothing, it's not impossible at all, it's quite handy. But for a lot of people, when they get in the state of doing nothing, they don't like it. In waiting in a waiting room at a hospital or at a clinic or whatever like that, is tough People waiting at train stations and airports, that's tough, right? We don't, because you've got nothing to do.

**Speaker B:** I was, I've always contemplated why that is, and I came out like it's because there's like a fear, you know, I think, right?

**Speaker A:** I fear I've got better things to do.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, really? Yeah, well, that they should be doing something.

**Speaker A:** You'd be doing something. Yeah, that's why cell phones wind up being best friends for people who have absolutely nothing to do. At least they can fiddle with your cell phone.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's kind of interesting. Yeah. You don't really see people just sitting. You always see people sitting with their cell phone.

**Speaker A:** And you'll also see body language that they're quite agitated, shuffling around in the chair, twiddling thumbs, rocking their knees back and forth, crossing their ankles in one foot's just bouncing with agitation. Yeah, very common. Standing in line that way is true also. People don't like it when there's nothing to do. So, uh, getting yourself into a wat where there really is nothing to do is, you know, almost a slap in the face.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, a lot of people can't do that. Well, I mean, I can definitely do that. I've done nothing for days and days at a time. I think I'm ready to do that.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, you can, between now and March, you can check out some of the wats there locally. And if you decide to come, You're welcome. I've had so many students, probably as many as, gosh, a couple of dozen at least over the past several years. While COVID was thick and heavy, nobody came. But now that COVID is over, then in fact this island is absolutely packed. Every place that is open is full.

**Speaker B:** Really, eh? Even with COVID still kind of going.

**Speaker A:** So the COVID is basically over here, but meanwhile the Thai government has changed a lot of stuff to accommodate, uh, tourism because they just shut it off. They really damaged the economy because of how, uh, careful they were with COVID They still wear masks here. Everybody at the hospital wears a mask. I was there yesterday because I've got a visa, and so I've got to go get a physical exam. And they've got a box of masks there at the front desk, and if you come into the hospital without a mask They give you one. There's still much— that's the Thai way, though. And everything is kind of full for tourism. But that means then that things are going to get back to normal. I would also recommend that you start spending as much time as you can at deep of Bhawan, because that's where Ajahn Po generally hangs out.

**Speaker B:** Deep above Bhawan?

**Speaker A:** Yes. Well, when you get here, we'll point you to that. We got maps and everything.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Yeah, I'm actually ready to book a flight now, like, for March. Like, I can already do that. I think it'd be good in terms of the price to do it in advance, right?

**Speaker A:** All right, well, here's a minor item. The minor item is that you want to be able to arrive in Bangkok before, let us say, 4 or 5 in the afternoon, because then you could take a night bus that very night down here and be here the next morning. If you come after 6 o'clock or 7 o'clock, then you won't be able to do everything needed in order to make that bus, and you'll have to spend one night in Bangkok. The song is One Night in Bangkok Will Make a Hard Man Humble. The way to do it then is to, when you're looking for flights, look for the arrival time.

**Speaker B:** Before 4.

**Speaker A:** In fact, the arrival time is second. For me, the price would be the first item on the list. How much does this ticket cost? And then the second question is, what time does it arrive? They actually have, because of Let us say because of time zones and that kind of thing, there's a lot of flights that arrive in Thailand late in the middle of the night, 2, 3, 4, 5 AM. Those are just fine because that gives you absolutely all day long to get to that bus. It leaves at about 8 or 9 in the evening.

**Speaker B:** How far away is the bus from the airport?

**Speaker A:** All right, here's the thing. It's going to be, uh, in the basement of the airport is the, is the, uh, mass transit that is in the airport. It's, it's in the basement, so it's a subway, but when it leaves the airport property, it becomes a SkyTrain, and you take that all the way into the city, and, uh, you get off at the last stop and then take a taxi, which will now be very cheap, to take you a kilometer or so over to where you can get the bus ticket. It's actually a combination of bus and boat. So that's very easy to do. I'll give you all the details.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so I guess it's kind of a big decision still.

**Speaker A:** Uh, I know it's a big decision in your mind now because it's fear of the unknown. Of course you've got fear of the unknown, right? Everybody who comes finds that it was probably the best thing they ever did.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's good to hear. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Now, the more of a nest egg that you have built up, the more secure you will feel. So having like $8,000, $10,000, $12,000 US dollars or Canadian dollars would be a comfort for you. All right, you've got $100,000 and that should be comfort for several people. That did. In fact, uh, um, Eric is on, uh, VA disability. He was in the Navy and so he's got about $1,000. I don't know how much money it is, but he's got $1,000 a month coming in that he doesn't need. He doesn't need any of that money, right? Very little. And in fact, he left his laptop here.

**Speaker B:** Left his laptop at your house?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I left it here.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. I don't know why I would bring mine.

**Speaker A:** I mean, well, bringing a cell phone would be better. A laptop, I don't think that you need nowadays.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I just don't know how long I'll be there.

**Speaker A:** That's another— as long as you want to be. Yeah, until you, until you feel terrified because you've run out of money. Hmm. You can run out of money and not be feeling terrified.

**Speaker B:** That's true, right?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, especially as a monk. I just completely ran out of money. I had absolutely no money at all. And yet when it was time to go back to the States, I got help to get back.

**Speaker B:** No, I think even if I had no money left, I'd be okay in Thailand.

**Speaker A:** You'd be okay?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because you can just— it's always warm. You can just sleep under a tree or something.

**Speaker A:** You've got so many wats that have so many trees, and then you can go for breakfast because every wat has breakfast or lunch or something. That in fact, that's the thing that's in the Westerner's mind. We have to have accommodations and food. Well, those things are really easy to come by in Thailand. But they make it especially difficult in the West for you to come by the things that you need, right?

**Speaker B:** It's very difficult just to get like the basic things.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, um, that's basically because, uh, we don't teach our kids how to do good communal living. About the only thing that students ever get is in university, they live in a dormitory, but they don't really learn very much that way. But the wats, every wat that I know of, always has room for one more. If you're ready to sit down and do nothing, then you're going to be quite welcome Nice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's my favorite thing to do. I think that's why I feel like I just want to do nothing, and that's not what I'm doing. Like, the workday is so busy. And I can do that. I can be happy doing that, but it just feels.

**Speaker A:** Fine. Now the wisdom comes in. Okay, so that's the whole point, is once we're no longer trying to escape from the day-to-day world because we've got our mind straightened out Now we can use wisdom to figure out we can do better things with our time.

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so I hear that from you. That's why I'm spending a lot of time right now encouraging you to just drop it all and come on.

**Speaker B:** That's good. Yeah, because it'd be different if I was trying to escape from it. Yeah, that wouldn't be good. But I'm No, I'm in it and I'm doing it and I have been doing it for a long time and it just feels like I need to try something else and I think there's better things I could be doing.

**Speaker A:** With my time. Well, as far as your physical possessions go, traveling light is a good idea. And so maybe you can leave your stuff at your family's house, or you've got some friends or whatever like that, with the understanding that you may not see that stuff for a long, long time, or if ever again.

**Speaker B:** Oh, that's great. Drastic. But yeah, no, I don't have much stuff anyway. Yeah, I have been to Thailand before, actually, 4 years ago, but I wasn't really— I wasn't so much where I am now. Like, I was kind of going more for like just tourism, and I did do like one retreat there, but.

**Speaker A:** It.

**Speaker B:** Wasn'T very long, and I don't know, it wasn't— I just came with a backpack, that's all I needed.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's all you need is just, um, the kind of luggage that could be carry-on rather than checked baggage. If you've got baggage to carry on and checked baggage, you're bringing too much.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I don't know what I would bring. I mean.

**Speaker A:** Bring a smile.

**Speaker B:** Bring a smile. Yeah, I can do that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, David, well, why don't we finish this call? You've got some direction and things to think about now, and you would be very welcome here.

**Speaker B:** Oh, thank you so much. Yeah, I appreciate that. Thank you for your advice and your guidance. Yeah, I'll think about that in the coming days. And.

**Speaker A:** All right, we'll think it over for a few days and give me a call and we'll go from there.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay, that sounds great. Okay, thank you so much.

**Speaker A:** Yes, we'll see you soon. For sure.

**Speaker B:** Okay, see you soon.

**Speaker A:** Alrighty, bye-bye.

**Speaker B:** Hey, take care.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, primarily between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and a seeker named David (Speaker B), centers on a classic spiritual crossroads: the desire to leave worldly life for a deeper spiritual path. Here is a summary of the key themes and advice:

### **Core Dhamma Teaching: Internal Change vs. External Change**
*   **The Trap of "Geographic Therapy":** Dhammarato identifies David's desire to go to Asia and ordain as a common pattern—the belief that a major external change (new place, job, becoming a monk) will solve internal dissatisfaction. He points out that this is just another form of future-planning and craving for a different condition.
*   **The Real Work is Internal:** The fundamental teaching is that changing circumstances doesn't ultimately change how you feel. True peace comes from changing your relationship to feelings themselves. Contentment must be found "right here in this breath."
*   **Examining the Feeling:** Instead of acting on the impulse to escape, Dhammarato advises David to directly examine the *feeling* of wanting to leave—to see it as an impermanent (Anicca) feeling that arises and passes, not a command to act.

### **Practical Guidance for the Path**
*   **Testing the Waters Locally:** Before going to Asia, Dhammarato recommends David seek noble Dhamma and noble friends (Sangha) in local communities, particularly Sri Lankan or Thai temples where there are likely trained monastics. He suggests asking probing questions to find teachers of "noble Dhamma" (e.g., "I'm interested in how to be free from suffering right here, right now").
*   **The Invitation to Thailand:** Recognizing David's sincere readiness, Dhammarato shifts to a supportive role. He offers a concrete invitation to come to Thailand, providing:
    *   **Logistical Support:** Advice on flights, visas, transportation from Bangkok to his location, and COVID requirements.
    *   **Accommodation & Guidance:** A place to stay, orientation, and connections to monasteries (like Wat Khao Tum) and teachers (like Ajahn Po).
    *   **Ordination Options:** Information on alternative paths to ordination beyond the typical Westerner routes.
*   **The Mindset for the Journey:** Dhammarato emphasizes traveling light—both physically (a backpack) and mentally (letting go of possessions and security). He reassures David that basic needs (food, shelter) are easily met in the Thai monastic system and that a period of "doing nothing" is a valuable practice, not a problem.

### **Key Takeaways**
1.  **Wisdom Before Action:** The initial impulse to escape worldly life is a feeling to be understood, not immediately acted upon. True motivation should come from wisdom and contentment, not aversion.
2.  **The Sangha is Crucial:** Fulfillment is found internally, but it is greatly aided by being around others who have found that fulfillment. Finding the right spiritual community is essential.
3.  **A Supported Leap:** Once the decision is made from a place of clarity (not escape), practical support and guidance are available. The path is "a whole lot easier to do than it is to think about."
4.  **The Goal is Freedom:** The conversation moves from abstract Dhamma discussion to a tangible plan because David expresses a foundational contentment and a wise desire to use his time for something deeper, not because he is running from suffering.

In essence, the talk is a blend of **deep Dhamma instruction** on not seeking happiness through external conditions and **loving, practical mentorship** for someone genuinely ready to take the next step on the path.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary **metaphor** used is:

**The Jeweled Box / Secret Treasure:** Speaker A (Dhammarato) describes Buddhism as a beautiful, ornate jeweled box with secret doors. The external, ornate box represents the popular, ceremonial, and "worldly" Buddhism taught to most laypeople. The hidden treasure inside represents the "noble Dhamma"—the core, liberating teachings of the Buddha that lead to the end of suffering. This metaphor illustrates that the profound truth is present but not immediately visible; one must know how to access it.

The main **story or narrative arc** in the talk is:

**The Seeker's Journey from Restlessness to Commitment:** The conversation follows Speaker B's (David's) internal journey. It begins with a feeling of spiritual restlessness and the common **"geographic solution" story**—the idea that changing your external environment (job, city, becoming a monk in Asia) will solve an internal problem. Dhammarato gently deconstructs this narrative, pointing out that the same feelings of dissatisfaction will follow you. The story then shifts to a **practical guide story**, where Dhammarato becomes a mentor, offering concrete steps (visiting local temples, asking specific questions, planning a trip to Thailand) and reassurance. The dialogue culminates in the **"invitation and reassurance" story**, where the abstract desire transforms into a concrete plan, with Dhammarato offering logistical support, personal stories of other Westerners, and the comforting idea that a life of "doing nothing" in a supportive spiritual community is not only possible but welcomed.

**Other supporting metaphors and analogies include:**

*   **"Changing the furniture" vs. "Changing the mind":** The idea that changing your external circumstances is like rearranging furniture in a room you're unhappy with, whereas real change comes from changing your internal relationship (feelings) toward those circumstances.
*   **The Fetter of "Making a Big Change":** Framing the desire for a drastic external change as a spiritual fetter or hindrance that itself needs to be examined, rather than acted upon impulsively.
*   **"Doing Nothing":** This is used both literally (as a daily practice in a *wat*) and as a metaphor for a state of contentment and non-striving, contrasted with the agitated, busy "doing" of worldly life.
*   **The "Nest Egg" of Savings:** Used as a metaphor for the psychological comfort and security that allows one to take the leap into the unknown, even if the money isn't strictly needed.
*   **"Traveling Light":** A metaphor for both physical minimalism (a backpack) and the mental/emotional letting go of possessions and attachments to embark on the spiritual path.

In summary, the talk uses the central **metaphor of the jeweled box** to explain the structure of Buddhist teaching, and unfolds as a **personal story of guidance**, moving the listener from a place of vague aspiration to the threshold of practical action.
