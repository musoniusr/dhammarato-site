### Transcript


**Speaker A:** topic?

**Speaker B:** Well, actually, the topic is useful to introduce it as soon as the student is capable of understanding it without getting unhappy or sad or whatever, that they kind of accept things as they really are. So talking about rebirth to, uh, let us say your average low-class, uh, Thai person, uh, out in the village, it would not be good. But walking down the street, your average person in Bangkok, that would be okay. In fact, I know of stories like that of the, of, um, uh, Westerners who have gone to Thailand, they think, and gone to Bangkok instead walking down the street trying to do a survey, and they couldn't find anybody who— all the Thais would not only dismiss

**Speaker A:** that

**Speaker B:** there is no God, but they will dismiss it if it was a ridiculous question to ask.

**Speaker A:** Right. Okay, okay.

**Speaker B:** So that's the standard, let us say, intellectual or high-class way of Thai people thinking. The average high-class person is quite capable of understanding the teachings of the Buddha, is that the word rebirth means to be reborn in a state that we don't like to be in, or a woeful kind of state, but that it doesn't have anything to do with the kind of magic that would take a god that would manufacture souls that lasted forever. Okay, that the whole issue in Buddhism over the word anatta has a whole lot of confusion built in it, that it would have been in fact much better for the original translators to have known a little bit more about the word so that they could have translated more correctly into the word no soul, Anatta, rather than no self. Because, okay, and the concept of a self or the concept of unity is, um, built right into language.

**Speaker A:** Hmm. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Because of the language itself, there were some people who would say, aha, the Buddha himself agrees that there is a self because he talks in words like me.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I've read a couple books and they go into self and stuff like that. I mean, it's something I'd very much like to experience and understand. Forgive my term here, but myself. But, you know, it's like the use of the word I, me, etc. They really pointed that out and sort of like the connotations that it has. But they're terms and words which are so integrated into language that it seems very, very, very difficult to try and talk to someone without using them, right?

**Speaker B:** And actually, so long as you understand and know what you're talking about, there is no reason to try to avoid that language, because we don't have a, for instance, neuter for first person. Neuter.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's no substitute.

**Speaker B:** Right, uh, like it. Okay, and, and it and this are neutered kinds of words, and so referring to oneself as this would be more correct, but it, let us say, makes language sound confusing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** The other way of doing it is to talk completely in passive terms so that, uh, there is no first person referred to. Now, this is actually quite common in Thai language. I wonder if that were true or not, because, uh, there are words in Thai language for, uh, me the man and me the girl Uh, and, uh, we also have even particles at the end of sentences, as if the women are supposed to say this word as a polite word and men are supposed to say another word that's a polite word. And if you leave it off, you're intentionally not being polite. And that's something that the Westerners don't understand,

**Speaker A:** right? Right. Okay.

**Speaker B:** Of it is that the pronouns are just left out completely and people expect to get it out of context. Like, uh, Pai Tiao can, uh, means to go play, literally. Uh, Pai is to go,

**Speaker A:** uh, um,

**Speaker B:** and so Pai Tiao, uh, could be seen in the sense of asking a question, are you going out?

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** Okay, statement, I'm going out. Or it could be a statement depending upon the situation that we're all preparing and already know. And so Pai Tiao is a statement, you should go. In other words, Pai Tiao means I'm ready to go, let's go, we're going to do that together. And it's all the same language, you see. In English, we tend to make that distinction. We tend to bring the person into it rather than leaving the person in context. All right, so, uh, knowing that and knowing also that, uh, Pali was like that— it's an Indo-European language, uh, Thai is a tonal language that has no case, no gender much, um, uh, no tense. Okay, that the tense is actually expected as understood, or if you have to say it, you have to say it in using another word or a particle word, right?

**Speaker A:** So people understand the tenses based on the situation or the subject of a conversation. They're able to in further tense.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. So you could also have a word to make sure of it, but the word also has other values. An example of that is the word in English 'already,' because this is the word that means exactly that. You could also go so far as use the word 'even,' like even Steven. Okay. Uh, so we could say it like this in simple English without putting in the, uh, of the tenses. Uh, uh, go to town already. And that infers that I have already gone to town.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So in that regard, it says,

**Speaker A:** uh,

**Speaker B:** uh, uh, uh, Piti Alau, which now we put it in past tense, but you still have to figure out who it was and when and where and all of that kind of stuff. But all— but it also can have that other kind of context in it. And you could say piti alao would mean let's go already. And so, and yeah, put past participles in it, or not past participles but past tense sounding kinds of words, still doesn't mean that. But it all has to— the Thai language is is somewhat of a contextual language.

**Speaker A:** Hmm, I think it's kind of the same with some instances in Japanese as well. At the moment I'm an online English tutor, so I talk to lots of people from Japan and Korea and a few from Thailand as well, and I think it's the same in Japan, like people will just end up missing out entire words or phrases, and they just substitute in one word to mean a whole sentence. But because of the context, because of the situation, people understand what they're meant— what's being said.

**Speaker B:** That's built in as part of the language that is often not built into English, because in English we're supposed to get that stuff defined.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, exactly.

**Speaker B:** So in some cases, uh, it takes very few words in Thai language to say what you could say in English. It'd take a whole lot of words. But there are other contexts when you've got to actually spell out exactly what's going on in Thai language. It'll take them this many words to say what in English could have been said in this many words, but in simple Thai could have been in just couple words. And then those cases would be like in legal documents, or perhaps in newspapers and places in public print. But in conversations, everything is expected to be in context. So let's now go back to the whole point, because this whole point is, is that let's not try to avoid pronouns in English as sort of a teaching tool of I'm supposed to be Anatta, because Because in fact I practiced that for many, many years.

**Speaker A:** Oh really? Was it difficult? It sounds very difficult.

**Speaker B:** Um, there is, when growing up, a game that was played at, uh, baby showers, and that is, is that, uh, the game that's played, it's a long-term game during the whole time is, is that no attendant at that shower can use the word baby.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** All right. Isn't that interesting? So this is going to be a whole lot of hilarity because some of them just don't have the mind to avoid the words while a whole bunch of other people are sitting there listening to you, waiting for you to say the word. And when you do Okay, so, um, it's a very interesting kind of thing, but it also— you can see that it is spiritual in a way of becoming mindful of one's speech. All right, so becoming mindful of speech means that we would— and I use the word we here as a substitution to step away from anything closer. So that, that would be a way to start to speak, is start using, uh, the royal we. Doctors use it because the doctors know that what they're saying is often a prescription or a medical diagnosis or something that has the entire medical profession backed up. This doctor is not— this is my, as a personal, I did it all myself. I went to graduate school, I got my medical degree, I practiced medicine at the hospital, and now I'm the doctor who gives you this. That whole context is missing there. No, it's a we in the sense of I'm representing the entire medical profession, and I invite you to go get a second opinion. Opinion.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so, uh, uh, bring— this is also a way of thinking of it in the sense of the Dhamma, the teaching, the Dharma. People will often say, you've got some really good ideas there, and that will be a reminder of this is not mine. This is Dhamma. This is a pot of gold I found in the woods, and I'm not sure who owns it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so, uh, let's get back to why would we even bother to practice and do stuff like that? What's this whole thing about? Well, first off, let's look at the word anatta. Uh, anatta. I mean, it's not ata. The word ata is also in the word of Mahatma. Atta. Mahayana. Mahatma Gandhi, which actually then does translate correctly as great soul. Okay, now what we really— the confusion was, and I got within this. In fact, I've got a really good friend, uh, Toon, who is Estonian that actually lives, uh, close to Wat Soan Mok at Don P.M. And he pointed this out to me, and I really am grateful to some of my old Dharma friends because, uh, Dhamma Piti has pointed some stuff out like this with language. We've got some people who really know what's going on around here. So this Greek word, uh, for Ata, they thought was the word for atom or atom. And we, uh, but the real Greek is, is that the whole idea of Pythagoras and atom and all of that was fairly recent Greek in the sense that it, it was approximately the time of the Buddha. It wasn't part of the original Indo-European language. But there is another word that is. So listen carefully. A-T-O-M, A-T-M-O. Atmo.

**Speaker A:** Atmo.

**Speaker B:** Atmo.

**Speaker A:** Atmo.

**Speaker B:** Right, that's the word for Atma. Atmo and Atma are the words that connect together, not the word atom, which actually means not breakable or not splittable. Okay, Anapanasati means not cut, right? But the word atmosphere gives us our language for atmosphere.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah. Uh-huh.

**Speaker B:** Okay, now we're beginning to think about the atmosphere is what we breathe. It is the breath of life. If you do not take in atmosphere every minute or so, you're going to die.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you're not going to have a good time.

**Speaker B:** I'm going to have a good time if you don't have some atmos. Yeah, okay. The point of it is, is that yes, it is actually can be considered in that religious kind of old-school way of thinking, is it is life-giving itself, therefore it must be life itself.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, I see that.

**Speaker B:** Okay, which means that this life force that is there in the atmosphere is not mine inside of me. So that's one of the ways of looking at it. Now, the Vedantas and others will say that the greater whole or the universe being one with all or becoming one with everything, you know, the jokes and all of that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, basically, take a picture about it. In the old days, it was this atmosphere. It's this suit that we live in, and it's everywhere.

**Speaker A:** It is. It is literally everywhere.

**Speaker B:** Sometimes it's foul, but it's still air.

**Speaker A:** Yes, sometimes it's very, very foul, but it's still— yeah, like you say, it's

**Speaker B:** still— almost always the reason that it is foul is because something's been hot, something's been burning. That the effect of— for the air is that it's, uh, that when something is on fire, burning with desire, smoke gets in your eyes. It pollutes the atmosphere. We can't see, we can't breathe, anything like that. It's on fire. Hence, that's why, uh, Tanisaro would make phrases like, um, Mind like fire unbound, or practice Dhamma as if your hair was on fire.

**Speaker A:** As if your hair was on fire?

**Speaker B:** Haven't you ever heard of that?

**Speaker A:** No, never.

**Speaker B:** Dhamma, practice Anapanasati as if your hair is on fire. You'd better. I mean, look what could happen.

**Speaker A:** I quite like my hair, so, uh, yeah, I think I will take that advice to heart.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so that's kind of a joke, but it's pointing in that direction that life force is also cleansing in the sense that it takes the dirt out of the things that have been on fire. A fresh breeze, cool wind, air. This is so important that it's built in like that, uh, with that connection to— guess what? Anapanasati. Indeed. Isn't that interesting how all of this stuff ties back together again?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it's all tied together with a lovely little bow on top.

**Speaker B:** The bows are optional. Okay, so, um, the atman, or the self— the Buddha says, no, you're not the atman, you are not the life itself, you're just here to observe. And the other part about it is, is that that means that you're not permanent, because, um, the Brahmins— and this started According to Dhamma Vitu, it started about 800 BC when the things got really, really tough with the Brahmins and the Aryans were strong enough to start taking back the land. And the Brahmins used to control it all before the Aryans came. There was only two clans or two castes, and that was the Brahmin class and the Sudras, the ones who then at that time in the beginning owned the land and were farmers and all of that. But after enough funerals, after enough funerals, the Brahmins began to pick up more and more of the land. And then when the Aryan races came in from Mesopotamia, or who knows where, and whether or not they brought the Indo-European language or whether it was already Indian, that's now a new controversy. But when the Buddhist clan, the Aryans, came, they brought with them a whole merchant— like an army. When an army travels, it doesn't just have army, at least a half if not two-thirds of the people in that traveling troupe are support people that are not actually dressed in the military. They're the ones who make the uniforms. They're the ones who make the tools. They're the ones who do the gathering up of the food and cooking. And they're the wagoners and they take care of the horses. And you wouldn't believe how many there are, people like that. Yeah, they say that the army travels on its stomach. And this is what they're talking about, that there is all of this baggage that has to go along with an army. Okay, so when they came, now you've got the army, the support for the army, you've got the Brahmins and the Sudras. Now in India you have four classes of people, four castes. Okay, and the army baggageers became the merchant class, and the military still became and stayed the rulers and the aristocratic. You still had the original priests, the Brahmins, and then you had the Sudras that bored talking about having the bad, less end of it. They had the worst of it when the Brahmins had it all, and now they're cutting them off. So this is the caste system. This was when Brahmins started saying that, oh, we are special and we are Brahmins, not because we're military, but because we're priests. And we are priests because we were born priests. We run the religion here and you don't,

**Speaker A:** right?

**Speaker B:** And now they come up with the perspective of, and the reason for that's true, that you were not born a Brahmin is because you were not good in your past, and the reason that I was born Brahmin is because I was good in the past. And guess what? There is that I And there is reincarnation born as a political maneuver.

**Speaker A:** Political politics.

**Speaker B:** Yes. So the whole quality of rebirth and reincarnation was a political maneuver in the first place, but it was an old political maneuver. For instance, Pharaohs. Yeah, yeah, yeah, same thing, right? I am so important, I'm a god, and I'm going to be born and resurrected, therefore you have to go build me a pyramid.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, the pharaoh is just a reincarnation, and you know, they've got a—

**Speaker B:** all right, at least they've got an afterlife nobody else does. You see, that's the place where things are really strange.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, only those important noble people have the possibility of chilling with the gods in the afterlife, right?

**Speaker B:** But listen to that Brahmin story. When that Brahmin story gets picked up by Alexander and his crowd, when they come marching through, the Greeks, when they come through, that in fact one of the points that I'm still trying to figure out is, is that because of the time frame and because of the expansion of the empire, it actually looks like that Alexander the Great did actually go to battle with King Ashoka. Okay, so run and chased Alexander back out of India. So he went up into Afghanistan because he couldn't do such. But they— but meanwhile, he was in India long enough to introduce statuary into Buddhism.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker B:** There was absolutely no statuary, uh, from that time, but in the time of Asoka, statuary started to appear in Greek form.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker B:** So the standing Buddhas that you will find all over, uh, Bodhgaya and mostly, uh, the Deer Park is the Tanha. All of those really old statues that they've dug up from that time are very Greek in their presentation, very similar

**Speaker A:** to the sort of architecture, the style.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so this is also the time when in Egypt something very remarkable started to happen, and that is anybody who had any money at all started beginning to mummify back at the really old old days, only the kings were mummified, only the aristocracy, only the really, really top class. Now, yeah, any merchant, anybody's got any money, they want to be mummified. And that started during the Ptolemaic time. I wonder where they changed it from only a king can get reborn if he does enough, um, what do they call it, rituals over him, is to— oh, why don't we hire the same, uh, priest to pray over us and we'll give him all our land so that Grandpa can be reborn? And so this is where all of that kind of stuff gets started. And it got started back in India. But you can think of it that being reborn— so now Christianity comes by with, again, everybody's going to be reborn. One. All you now have to do is become a Christian and thou shalt be saved. Okay, so now the easy way out, but it's still the same story. And that story has to do with everyone has an internal mechanism that is called an instinct, the survival instinct.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Okay, if that survival instinct is strong, then the thought with that survival instinct is I want to live forever.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so that whole idea of being reborn is delicious.

**Speaker A:** It is, yeah.

**Speaker B:** You know, it's like I get a second chance. Not only that, but the promise is if I'm a good boy, I'll get a really good reward, and if I'm a bad boy, I'm going to get punished.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** This idea of heavens and hells, guess where they came from? They don't come from, from Judaism, but they were already pre-existing in India. So where do you think concepts of heaven— and I mean, even the River Styx and Hades was still a land of the dead. It wasn't a land of punishment until the Ptolemy period. Which was after Alexander the Great died, you know, the Ptolemy.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Sorry, I'm not— maybe— okay, so we're talking about 300 BC. Yeah, yeah, maybe 250 BC, uh, 150 BC. That period of time is when these, uh, strange things started to happen in Europe or in the Mesopotamian area. Due to the fact that Alexander the Great had been in India. But going back to the point about it is that this is the issue of the self. And this was teaching of the Buddha, is that there is no soul that is permanent, everlasting, and strong enough to make you a Brahmin in the next life if you've been a goody-two-shoes this life.

**Speaker A:** Goody-two-shoes. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So in that regard, the original translation should have been no soul.

**Speaker A:** No soul.

**Speaker B:** No soul. Now, um, a lot of people will try to get around the soul as to whether it's something that's physical whether it's not physical. Okay, but we already know enough from Einstein and modern physics that if it's not physical, then it's energetic. Yes, yeah, but energetics don't have— how to say it— energetics is movement. When things heat up, the molecules start running around each other faster.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, they get very speedy, very speedy.

**Speaker B:** They get speedy. Okay, so this is the whole quality then of energy has to do with motions and speed. Yeah, and time and things like that. And what is it that's moving? And this kind of thing, which means that In that regard, if it's energetic, there's no possibility of a soul. Yeah, an example of that, right down to the electron level, that if you put an electric charge on this end and you take it out on this end, okay, was it the electron that went into this end of the wire, that the same electron that came out of that end of the wire?

**Speaker A:** No.

**Speaker B:** How do you know?

**Speaker A:** It could have been another electron along the way.

**Speaker B:** It could have been, but how do you see— point I'm making is, is that electrons are indeterminate.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Or characteristics. And this is an old issue in particle physics. This is an unsolvable question for that reason.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, electrons are weird. They both exist and they don't exist, and they choose when they want to exist.

**Speaker B:** And this is— does a whirlwind exist?

**Speaker A:** Does a whirlwind exist?

**Speaker B:** Does a whirlwind exist?

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Okay, but then, uh, nothing much changes when the whirlwind doesn't exist.

**Speaker A:** Very true. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right, so whirlwind, and this is picking up particles, but now, yeah, the level of the whirlwind at the electron level is nothing but a little tiny whirlwind of space and time.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, particles there.

**Speaker B:** Therefore they have very few characteristics. There's only 4 characteristics to an electron. Therefore you cannot tell The same conundrum exists in the sense of, does light travel in one direction and then travel back in the same direction at the same speed? And that is also another conundrum that we can't answer because we cannot measure the light going from here to there. We just can't. Yeah, even if we had two different, uh, um, high-speed clocks. The clocks were together when they were here, but if you move this clock over here, they're going to have slightly different time differences. Yeah, therefore you cannot use a clock.

**Speaker A:** No, you can't.

**Speaker B:** The only thing that you can do is use a mirror so that you can put it in here, have it bounce back, and now you can get it, right? But how do you know that it was the same? You can't just divide it in half because we don't know that yet. That. Okay. This is the kind of stuff that makes this very, very interesting in the sense that the Buddha comes now to the five aggregates. The five aggregates are extremely important. There are probably 15 or 20 references to them in the Majjhima Nikaya, including the fact that they're in the Anapanasati Sutta and they're in the Satipatthana Anapanasati, and it is a major characteristic of the practice of Mahayana.

**Speaker A:** Well, they sound very important then.

**Speaker B:** Well, the actual teachings is not the constituent components of who you are, that in fact you could say that whoever you are, the personality has these 5 components, right?

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And most people confuse that they think that they are these components. Okay, what are these components? The body, the feeling, consciousness, and the sense of being able to know something. And the next one is perception, the ability to process, the ability to think. This is who I am because I think. This way. This is the process of thinking that I do. And then the last one on the list is the Samskara, or all of my past memories. Who I am is my past.

**Speaker A:** Pause.

**Speaker B:** Who I am is my past. Who I am is the way that I think. Who I am is what I can see and observe, plus my feelings and the body. Now, the most basic mistake is to consider that I am the body because because that's the slowest moving object. Because it's slow moving, it's easy for the fool to become identified with the body. I am this body. And look how many big business industries are associated with that belief. The clothing industry.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** The hair cutters. The workout rooms, the way that—

**Speaker A:** yeah,

**Speaker B:** the hospitals and the doctors too.

**Speaker A:** That's true, they deal with people and bodies every single day throughout their entire careers.

**Speaker B:** I am my body, and if my body has a problem, I can't fix it myself. I need a doctor. Or I have a body and my body is not beautiful enough, let me go to Max Factor.

**Speaker A:** Let me go to the gym or to the weight room. Let's sort it out. Let's sort it out. Let's look good. Let's tone up.

**Speaker B:** Right. I am unhappy with my body, therefore I've got to go work on my body because I don't like me in this body. Okay, but Jesus even says you can't change your height even an inch.

**Speaker A:** Yep, very true.

**Speaker B:** You can't do that. You cannot make yourself 10 years old this week and 65 next week. All over the body. Therefore, if anything, the body is a house that we live in and not the me itself.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Well, the next quality then that we have to deal with is I am not my feelings, because everybody in in fact, is generally driven by their feelings. Like, I feel sad today, or I feel angry. Okay, what they're actually recognizing there is that it's not that they own the feelings, but rather that the feelings own them. Just like the body owns me, or the house. I mean, if you've ever bought and owned a house with a mortgage and all that, you begin to get the feeling that, hey, wait a minute, I thought I was a homeowner, and really the home is an owner of me. When its toilet breaks, I'm responsible for fixing that toilet. When that light goes out, it's my job to go fix it. Therefore, I am nothing but a fix-it man for this house, and it runs my life.

**Speaker A:** That's a very good point, a very good point.

**Speaker B:** Well, people do that with their bodies too. I mean, look how much shopping they do to try to keep the body up when the body is going to fall apart whether they try to keep it up or not.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it doesn't matter how long it will take, it will fall apart eventually.

**Speaker B:** It will fall apart eventually. That's exactly right. And if you live your life happily, it might not fall apart so fast. If you keep beating on it, whipping on it, racing it around,

**Speaker A:** then, you

**Speaker B:** know, taking it to the gym, putting too expensive fancy clothes on it Keep taking you to a doctor who keeps plugging it up with stuff.

**Speaker A:** It might fall apart even quicker.

**Speaker B:** It might. It just might. So if you just leave the darn thing alone, it might in fact be okay. And it's a nice house to live in if we stop messing with it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** But the feelings, the feelings of what we think that is my feelings, where in fact, no, the feelings are even more of a boss. That if you have anxiety, instead of absolutely dealing directly with that anxiety, we go try to please it. Oh, the reason I feel anxious is because I don't have this, that, or the other thing. Think if I go get this, that, or the other thing, then the anxiety will subside. Actually, while we're actually grasping and clinging and getting that object, we may not be aware of the anxiety, but as soon as we get it, the anxiety will come back. The story is that the old man was living in a hovel many centuries ago and laying in his hovel And he has anxiety and he knows it. He can feel that anxiety. So he starts to think, what, what, what, what? And it's that bench. And so he gets up, he goes out, and he starts repairing the fences. He gets the stones there to make sure that the wolves can't get in and the goats can't get out. And after 2 or 3 hours in the middle of the night, he comes back down and lays back in the bed. And guess what? Anxiety comes comes back again.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, it comes back.

**Speaker B:** He comes back. So it wasn't the build, it wasn't the wall that he needed to build. That was just a temporary relief from the anxiety. He's not dealing directly with the anxiety. Okay, the only way that we can deal with the anxiety directly is by separating ourselves from it. I am not the anxiety. This is not me that's anxious. It's just anxiousness that can be seen. It's almost like it like this: I am the anxiety, this is the anxiety, and I'm clinging to it strongly. So therefore I am being led everywhere that anxiety goes, there I go with it. Okay, until we wake up. Aha, I see you, anxiety. And now the separation occurs, and you are no longer the anxiety, and the anxiety is no longer you.

**Speaker A:** You're just an observer of an anxious feeling.

**Speaker B:** An anxious feeling, precisely.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** This is how we are to deal with the five aggregates, is to separate ourselves from them so that we recognize for sure that it is just a feeling. It's not my feeling. It's just a body, not my body. It's just perception. It is not my perception that in fact perception is almost always based upon the Samskara of the past. You've probably heard garbage in, garbage out. That happens in the human mind moment by moment. We take the past to try to make sense out of the present moment. And sometimes we're right, and sometimes we're not. That's what happens. So our past is what we remember, but either we don't process it well enough, or that it's got holes in it. And there's all kinds of possibilities for holes in our memories. For instance, we may have not been able to observe what happens. That's an example of that, is that in the United States there's trial going on, uh, for the killer of George Floyd.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** What— and what the prosecutors have done is they have put every witness that they could find on the stand. One witness is not going to be good enough, and everybody knows it. Why? Because no one's memory is going to be good enough. They want everybody's opinion, right?

**Speaker A:** Okay, so any holes that they have can be filled by each individual people.

**Speaker B:** Each individual witness then to that event only saw part of the story. Yeah, which means that anytime that you're at any kind of event in your own life, you're only seeing part of the story. You never get the full story.

**Speaker A:** Very true. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Our perception then is going to be always polluted by bad input. To the memory system. Not only that, but memories get layered so that more recent memories for some people are more likely to be used than old memories for others, but they're still layered in there. And so within the teaching of the Buddha, it's better to not disturb those layers so that we can always use the most recent ones, because by the time we're getting into the Dharma, most of our memories are going to now be some. And the really old, unwholesome stuff is going to be buried at the bottom, and you don't want to disturb that.

**Speaker A:** We don't want no unwholesome stuff. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

**Speaker B:** So we're going to keep our memories short. Okay, so, uh, when, when our memories are actually there, there's also the

**Speaker A:** issue

**Speaker B:** that when they come out there, it may be the wrong memory that comes up, it may be the wrong stuff, it may be that I remembered it wrongly in the first place, and therefore I chose this to be the stuff I'm processing the current moment with when I should have been processing it otherwise. Okay, so now we're beginning to see that, wait a minute, we've got problems with person, with memory. It's bad in the beginning, it's bad in the middle while it's in there, and it's bad in the end when it comes back out. It's better not to trust memory systems.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, they can get polluted. It can get polluted along the way, altered slightly during the situation that you're remembering. You know, something might have distracted you, so you remember it incorrectly, and your brain tries to guess what happened, and it could fill it in incorrectly. So there's a lot of room for a lot of errors.

**Speaker B:** Exactly. And if we know that, then the right answer to that question is let's keep looking in the present moment instead of relying upon old conclusions. That in fact, we can see how those old conclusions have, let us say, slowed down science over the centuries. But that now the most modern generation is beginning to not rely upon the conclusions of their professors in universities anymore. That in fact, even the professors are not even relying upon their old professors anymore. So let me give you a really clear example. The steam engine. Watts. England. Do you know what that first steam engine was used for?

**Speaker A:** Uh, I do not know.

**Speaker B:** It was used to pump water out of a coal mine.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay, okay.

**Speaker B:** Like, end of story. We don't need any more. I just mentioned the two things: water and coal. What do you need for a steam engine to operate?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you need, you need fuel, you need coal, you need, uh, water.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right, exactly. Yeah, steam engine, right?

**Speaker A:** Steam engine.

**Speaker B:** It took them 100 years to take the steam engine out of the coal mine. It never occurred to them that they could put a steam engine outside the factory, bring the coal and bring the water in, and have that steam engine then run all of these belts that we could build an industrial Industrial Revolution on. Okay, so from the 1600s to the 1700s, we at least moved that steam engine out of the coal mine next to the factory. Guess what? It took them another 100 years to put wheels on the steam engine for a locomotive.

**Speaker A:** Took them quite a while.

**Speaker B:** Uh-huh. But you can see what has happened in the past 100 years. Now things are beginning to pick up. But it took them 2 generations of 200 years to go from one to the second generation to the third generation. It took them 200 years to get there from the 1600s to the 1800s. Once we started laying track, that's when things began to innovate at a much higher speed. If you can think about that steam engine, do you know when the transistor was invented?

**Speaker A:** I do not know.

**Speaker B:** No, it was, it was actually under development in the 1950s, but they did not come commercially available in any quantities at all until early 1960s. But by 1967, they were in computers.

**Speaker A:** One innovation, and then it takes off, and then all of a sudden everything else—

**Speaker B:** one computer with transistors at some university University in 1963. The IBM is actually manufacturing and putting them in universities in 1970, and now only 50 years, everybody's got one on in their hand, literally in their hand. Yeah, I, I would— let's see, we probably have 20 working computers here at the house.

**Speaker A:** Really?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because everybody's got a cell phone.

**Speaker A:** True, true. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** And that's— guess what, I've got, I've got, uh, servers. Servers run Linux.

**Speaker A:** Oh, Linux.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, 7 of them. So I've got a server that only the size of a hard drive, but it doesn't have a USB, it's got an RJ45 jack to plug into the internet. And so it takes a lot of processing skill. Okay, this is how ubiquitous they are. They're getting to the point that even refrigerators are going to have them, even blenders are going to have them.

**Speaker A:** Everything's going to have them.

**Speaker B:** Everything that's got electrical happen. Even the new TV that we've got hooks to the internet, and you can sit there with the thing, and I can see, I can see what kind of processors they've got, because when it's reading a disk, uh, you can plug a, um, uh, flash drive in it And if it's got 3 or 4 movies, they'll show up. If it's got 10, it'll take a minute. If you've got 1,000 videos on there, it'll never show you your collection, but it's still a processor. So this is the innovation. Let's get back to the point of then that's another reason to stay in the present moment. We don't need to go back into, for instance, audio files. Because that was the big thing back in the 1960s, was tape. When's the last time you ever saw any tape?

**Speaker A:** And see, Lord knows, but, but, uh,

**Speaker B:** tape ran at 15 inches a second when it was tape. In the 1940s, they had wire, but getting it down to 1 7/8 inches a second on a cassette with 4 tracks so that you could take a cassette and turn it backwards. That didn't take so long. But now, where's the cassette? Are they even manufactured anywhere anymore? How about DVDs?

**Speaker A:** They're old news because— yeah, these are old now.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so this is another reason for us to recognize recognized that things are moving pretty fast. We don't need to delve in the past. So another part of it then is to understand this Samskara may have had some skills that were developed, some useful things that you can use in the moment, because some students misunderstand this instance and this thing called Samskara. That we could say that, yeah, there's more than one kind of Samskara, and that an example of that would be muscle memory.

**Speaker A:** Muscle memory.

**Speaker B:** Okay, that's a sign that that's the kind of stored thing so that a baseball player is more likely going to be able to catch a banana flying by him than a Thai man whose culture is against throwing objects. It's absolute no-no to throw an object here in Thailand.

**Speaker A:** Oh, okay.

**Speaker B:** But if you lived in a baseball culture, then having somebody throw an apple in your direction is not going to make you outraged or afraid. You're just gonna— you're just gonna catch

**Speaker A:** it, catch it, no problems.

**Speaker B:** So that's an issue then of muscle memory, and that we have a lot of skills built up over time that it both muscle memory, as well as conceptualizations, the ability to think, okay, actually improves. You can develop skills. An example of that is Sudoku. A beginner, you can give him an easy puzzle and it'll take him 15 or 20 minutes, okay? But someone who had been playing a lot of Sudoku, they can play a really, really hard game in that same period of time.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so, um, and in fact, a really easy game can be down to beginning to see how the mind works, because you can see that we don't— on Sudoku, you don't think in words.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's true, that's true.

**Speaker B:** And spatial objects, you think visually, so that by the time that you can actually push the 4, you already know where the next two are going to go. Your hands are actually slower than the mind figuring out where those numbers are going on an easy post when you know what to look for, when you develop the mind that way. Okay, so this also is a Samskara, but it's not the kind of Samskara that is painful. It's also memory systems in the sense of historians. They can remember a lot of stuff that they— that we wrote. Okay, so the Buddha actually, uh, it's actually Siriputta who talks about it, and I'm quoting now Sutta 9, which is actually— the name of it is Right View, Samadhi. And in there he discusses Samskara as this bodily kind and the verbal kind that we were just discussing. And then the next one is the Citta, which is more the emotional Samskara. This is the one that's the painful one, because this is where we store all our painful memories. We feel bad because we remember how to feel bad. Yes, yes. And we learned how to feel bad from our parents. As well as we knew instinctually how to feel bad. Okay, so now look at all this mountain of bad feeling material that we've got to sift through sometimes in order to bring ourselves up to this present moment, when in fact it would be better if we don't. It'd be better, in fact, if we gained some new skills with some new ones. This is why I discuss it in the sense of You have been talking yourself into feeling bad all of these years. Now it's time to talk yourself into feeling good. Okay, so this is where the Buddha comes in with all of these unwholesome thoughts. And the more we discover them, the more we recognize that these thoughts and concepts are only unwholesome because we can see that they're unwholesome. And if we cannot see that they're unwholesome, then we will continue to operate in whatever way they really are. And so part of the investigation, even in the Mahasi noting system, part of the investigation is to investigate these five aggregates, especially things that come up from the past, the thoughts that we have from the past and the feelings from the past, to recognize 100% that's not me. I'm not what I was in the past. Because if I think that I was something in the past and I remember something that I did that was really, really stupid, I'm going to feel really, really stupid and remorseful and all that kind of stuff because it's me that did it in the past. But if I can come to that separation and understand that, wait a minute, who whoever I was in the past that did that only saw things in his own way. But because I do not approve of that now, that means that I am already not the person who thought that that was a good thing to do at the time. Okay, and so we separate ourselves from our past, we separate ourselves from that old Samskara, and I— and we recognize that I am not what I have been thinking I've been all this time, because almost all the definitions that we have about who I am or who you are have to come with things you've done in the past. Yeah, okay. And that's especially true if someone holds a job for a number of years. And so the question is, who are you? The answer is, I'm a plumber, or I'm an electrician, or I'm a professor, or I'm some job that I've been doing a long time.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Or I'm a student or whatever, because we see that the way that we occupy our time defines who we are. Okay, well, if that's the case, then maybe I should go around saying, well, I am a happy one. I spend all my time just practicing and performing happiness.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I mean, I think there are many people who would like to be labeled as a happy one, so

**Speaker B:** Well, another way of saying a happy one would be the fortunate one, because a happy person is generally seen as fortunate.

**Speaker A:** Okay, yeah.

**Speaker B:** And also worthy of respect. I have just walked you into the definition of Arahant, because that's what the word means— one who is worthy of respect. One who is fortunate. In fact, the one who is fortunate, the Pali word for that is Bhagava, which is the word that's used for the Buddha a lot. Ah, and also it's used commonly in India. An example of that would be— have you ever heard of Osho?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, Bhagwan Rajneesh.

**Speaker B:** Anicca. There's that word. And that in magical terms is translated as a god, but in reality it just means someone who's really lucky, really fortunate, really happy about his circumstances.

**Speaker A:** That's all.

**Speaker B:** So this is the way then we begin to recognize that the way that I think, and actually that part of us who can see, the knower, the observer. Then when you're doing the Mahasi method of noting, what is it that notes? This is the consciousness, and you too are not that. Vinaya. It's just there that when we put the Vinaya, the noting, the knowing, the observational quality along with the body, the feelings, our ability to figure things out and perceive and perceptions along with all of our database, those 5 things put together make up a person's personality. Hmm. Guess what? You are not your personality.

**Speaker A:** All of these things which make up that one thing, and you're not even that.

**Speaker B:** If you're not in any of those things, then you could not be the whole show. This is where we come into, um, King Milanda and, uh, Nagasena, the monk that, uh, comes out of, I think, the 1st century BC. That gave rise to the Mahayana, and that Bhikkhu Buddhadasa has been compared in print in both English and Thai to Nagarjuna. So Nagarjuna was King Milinda, and they were talking about this very thing, and Nagarjuna says, with your permission, O King, I would like to take your chariot and manipulate it, and we'll and we'll put it back together in a few minutes. And so he had the guys take the basket off, take the wheels off, take this— you know, there's this thing called a spine that when you have two horses, you have them with a thing between them. Yeah, stagecoaches didn't have it, but chariots did. Yeah, it's also called a tongue. So you take the tongue down, that long pole, you take the axles, you take the basket, you spread them around. Oh King, where is the chariot?

**Speaker A:** Hmm.

**Speaker B:** And he looks over there. No, those are just wheels. No, that's just a basket. No, that's just a tongue. No, that's just harnessing. Hmm. You have to put all of it together and then it becomes a chariot.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, and so this actually— Naga Juno had just stumbled upon basic, uh, high-class, um, let us call it general systems theory. Have you ever heard of general systems theory?

**Speaker A:** I've heard of it, but I don't

**Speaker B:** know anything about it. There are several things about it that make it quite interesting, and that is the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.

**Speaker A:** Mm-hmm. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Why? Because the chariot parts laying around separated from each other is not a chariot. It's only when they collect together into a system, in a unified collective system where everything fits together correctly. Now what you have is something new out of those parts. You have transportation. The same thing would be an automobile. You can take your automobile and take all the parts all over the yard, you know, all the bolts are in a box over there and all the bumper parts are over there and the wheels are there and the tires are over there and all of that kind of stuff, right? No transportation. You have to put all that stuff back together, but you can't just pile it into a pile and say it's together. It's got to be constructed or unified correctly. It's got unified together in its right stage, and when that happens, it becomes a system, not just a pile of junk.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** And the system then becomes greater than the sum of all the parts in that system, and that's who you are.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** So you're right, really not there is like, where is the transportation when you point to the car? But we all know that the whole point of the car is transportation. Yeah, cannot see the transportation itself.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so if we understand the self to be like that, this is, um, a very, very good introduction that we'll do next time. Into the teaching of Paticcasamuppada, which is how this self is constructed out of these five aggregates.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's— it's very interesting stuff. Very, very interesting. And I know the— just through reading that, you know, the, uh, the identification of the self and whatnot is a root cause cause for an awful lot of suffering.

**Speaker B:** So, well, let us say this. We can actually short-circuit the whole thing, and we'll pick up with the five aggregates next time and how they fit into Paticcasamuppada. But we can boil it down to this one point, and that is, instead of looking at it as the word self and all the sophisticated ramifications with it, or even dissecting and using Freudian language is wrong, which will do next time. We can boil it down to one word that everybody, even a child, understands. One word, and that is selfishness. Okay, yeah, selfishness comes from being selfish, which means to take on the qualities of being a self. And when we're not selfish, that means we share We could be friends, we can be communal, we can get along, we can be friends. All of that kind of stuff works. Yeah, but when we're selfish, we tend to get angry, frustrated, uptight,

**Speaker A:** self-centered, and rude, potentially.

**Speaker B:** And so there it is. That's the Dukkha. So in fact, we could say that not only when a self is being reborn, because it's the selfishness is reborn, it's the self recurs and recurs and recurs. When we get selfish, when that happens, we automatically go into a woeful state.

**Speaker A:** And that's very true.

**Speaker B:** And there are four woeful states that the Buddha talks about. Guess where he got them? He borrowed this from the Brahmins. Like he borrowed almost everything. Buddhism is nothing but a Brahman contraption with a heart.

**Speaker A:** With a heart. With a heart. That's the important bit.

**Speaker B:** And that's what gives it momentum or transportation. So these four woeful states are a state that the self winds up in. There is the hell state. And what is hell is nothing but, I want out of here. I gotta get out of here.

**Speaker A:** Let me out, let me out, let me out.

**Speaker B:** Desperate. So it's desperation, it's anxiety, it's anger, it's hot. Another woeful state that we can be born into is being in a state of need. I gotta have it, I gotta have it, I gotta have it. This is the state of the what is called the Hungry Ghost or the Piti.

**Speaker A:** A little bit greedy.

**Speaker B:** Yes, greed. When we feel like we don't have all that we need, when we feel that we were incomplete— boy, I would be so much better off if I had that. I mean, that's, that's the typical thought of every high school boy as he's walking down the high school corridors when, uh, the class— every girl he sees, boy, I'd be better off if I had her.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's, uh, and that's a woeful

**Speaker B:** state to be in, is the state of I need something instead of being in the state of I'm just so happy, everything is just fine.

**Speaker A:** I don't— yeah, it does sound like a very Western thing, that state of need. Very, very Western, very materialistic.

**Speaker B:** It goes way back, wanting things we don't have. In fact, if you inspect the the second, uh, of the call— the second noble truth. There it is. And it winds us in this woeful state of being a hungry ghost, or being hungry all the time. We're hungry, hungry, hungry because we want more, more, more, more, more. It's called very hungry. Yeah, in America they call

**Speaker A:** it an executive. So what about the third?

**Speaker B:** The third one is the one that's the most common.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And that is the state of being an animal, the animal state.

**Speaker A:** Now, is that like instinctive, acting instinctively?

**Speaker B:** Not only that, but also Being like a draft animal.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker B:** It's like a draft animal in the sense that you do not get rewarded for your labors, but you do it anyway because, uh, not doing it is going to be even worse.

**Speaker A:** Right, right.

**Speaker B:** Train our children that way. Do your ABCs, go clean your room. And the kids don't want to do it, but they do it in anyway, and we wind up in our whole lives taking on jobs we don't want to do, but we do it anyway.

**Speaker A:** Homework.

**Speaker B:** The kids go to church, they don't want to go to church, but they do it anyway.

**Speaker A:** That's a very, that's a very good point.

**Speaker B:** You want to go down to this part of town and you know it's dangerous down there and you don't want to go, but you go anyway.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, that's very common. And then people at work are like, oh hey, could you do this please? I'm swamped. And you don't say no, you say yes even though you don't want to. Now your workload's piling up. And yeah, very common, very common.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it's very common. This is the most common state of all, is being an animal. And we'll talk about it more, but this is one of the four. The last one is kind of humorous almost until you see how devastating it is. This is the Asuras, which many people, um, mistake as a heavenly world, but in fact it's a hell world. This is also the world of the Titans in Greek mythology.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker B:** You know who the Titans are? They're the warriors. They're the ones who defend heaven. They're the ones who were all dressed up for battle and don't want to go. They're all dressed up for battle, but they don't want to go because they're afraid. Possibly the one example of that that I just think is so marvelous is the example of McClellan, who was the general who trained the Union forces for the Civil War under President Kennedy— Lincoln, sorry, Lincoln. Under Lincoln, he got a huge war machine going. And when Lincoln says, okay, go to war, he said, wait a minute, we need this. And wait a minute, we need that.

**Speaker A:** We need to train our men.

**Speaker B:** We need more training. We need this, that, and the other thing. And finally Lincoln says, enough of this. And he fired McClellan and put Grant hand. And they took that magnificent war machine up north, put it into the Ohio River, sailed it down to the Mississippi, landed in Vicksburg, and cut across the South from Vicksburg all the way to Savannah. Just destroyed— just took that one machine and just cut the South in half. But they wouldn't have done that with McClellan. He wouldn't have ever taken them to war.

**Speaker A:** He was too hesitant.

**Speaker B:** He was too hesitant. Now here's the same story. You have the fourth graders doing a skit at the end of the season, and the little boy walks out on stage dressed as a tree, and all he's got is one line and he forgets it. Oh, stage fright. That's a clear example of being an Asura, all dressed up, no place to go. Prepared. People walk into tests often doing this. So instead of getting a night's sleep and be ready for the test because they know they're well prepared, they're scared, they're all worrying, they're up and they're all up all night studying, and then they fall asleep while they're doing the test the next day.

**Speaker A:** Terrible, terrible.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so this is— these are the four woeful states. One is when we're afraid to act even though we're well prepared. The other one is that we go along to get along. We do what we're told to do

**Speaker A:** even if we don't want to do it.

**Speaker B:** Even if we don't— especially we don't want to do it. Then if we wanted to do it, then what's the problem? Now we're good to go.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** No, it's when we don't want to do it but we do it anyway. That's when we're in that woeful state of being an animal, of not getting the reward that we were promised. And then the next one is the Hungry Ghost, and then the first one was hell itself.

**Speaker A:** Hell itself,

**Speaker B:** the worst of it. And that's when we get really hot. That's anger. Okay, all four of these are a kind of a prison because we don't We don't like it, but many people, uh, will live in these, these jails, live in these prisons, live in these vocal states from moment to moment to moment, not recognizing each moment they're doing something that puts them right back into these selfish states.

**Speaker A:** They don't realize what they're doing. They put themselves back into it. They repeat it again and again and again throughout their lives, and that becomes the Samskara.

**Speaker B:** They live with. And they think it's me.

**Speaker A:** They identify with it too much, whereas they need to— yeah, yeah, yeah. But they need to separate from it and realize it's just like the waking up, you know. You wake up to it and then you're able to, as you say, plot your escape, plot your route out, right?

**Speaker B:** Once you see the danger in going to these unwholesome states, then you can plot your way out of it. So here's another example of the selfishness that we can see, and that is that a dear friend or brother or someone that you know comes to you, uh, with a financial problem and they need to borrow $500. If you tell them yes, then both of you will be happy that you've got the money. You feel wealthy and generous and you give it, and he's got it and he needs it and he really is grateful, and your bond is even better in that moment. Whether or not he pays you back is for the future. Let's not deal with that. Okay, the other possibility is for you to have some kind of thoughts and and then tell him no. He's disappointed and you feel broke. I can't give you $500, I don't have $500. And everybody feels bad. That's selfishness for you. Everybody's selfish right now. He needs the money, he wants the money, and where's your friendship?

**Speaker A:** You won't give any, so you're being selfish as well.

**Speaker B:** You're being selfish because you don't give him the money. He's being selfish because he can't get anything. Neither one of you you're very happy with each other. And that's a huge hindrance, that kind of selfishness. Hindering what? Hindering the joy of the present moment. Even if you didn't have the money, you say, hey man, I'll do everything I can to help you. What can we do? I've got this much. Maybe Susie will give us some. And then you can start plotting your escape out of your own selfishness.

**Speaker A:** Start plotting your escape.

**Speaker B:** Exactly.

**Speaker A:** It's crazy how it all ties together.

**Speaker B:** It all fits back together. So let's go ahead and finish this conversation, and next time we'll start talking about, uh, how these five aggregates get put into gear so that we wind up in these hell states, these wolf states.

**Speaker A:** That sounds like a very interesting conversation to come. I look forward to it.

**Speaker B:** Okay, Ben, well, we'll see you next time.

**Speaker A:** Yes, yes, chat to you soon. Thank you very much for today. Lovely to talk to you as always. And, uh, yeah, I will speak to you again very soon.

**Speaker B:** Keep your practice up. Keep them doggies rolling.

**Speaker A:** Keep those— oh yes, don't you worry, I will. All righty then, take care.

**Speaker B:** Okay, bye-bye. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) in conversation with a Sangha friend (Speaker A), explores the Buddhist concept of **Anatta (not-self)** by untangling it from cultural and linguistic misunderstandings, and connecting it directly to daily suffering and practice.

Here is a summary of the key points:

### Core Theme: Understanding "Anatta" Correctly
The central argument is that the core teaching of **Anatta is better understood as "no soul" rather than "no self."** This clarification is crucial because:
*   **Historical Context:** The idea of an eternal soul (Atman) was used politically in ancient India (e.g., by Brahmins) to justify the caste system via reincarnation. The Buddha's teaching of "no soul" directly countered this.
*   **Linguistic Simplicity:** Trying to avoid pronouns like "I" or "me" in English to embody Anatta is confusing and unnecessary. Language inherently implies a self; the insight is experiential, not grammatical.

### The Practical Target: Selfishness
The talk reframes the abstract concept of "self" into the immediately recognizable problem of **selfishness**. Selfishness is the moment-to-moment activity of clinging to a solid, separate "self," which is the root of dukkha (suffering).

### The "Four Woeful States" of Selfishness
When selfishness arises, we are "reborn" into one of four miserable mental states (adapted from traditional Buddhist realms):
1.  **Hell:** The state of anger, hatred, and desperation ("I've got to get out of here!").
2.  **The Hungry Ghost (Peta):** The state of insatiable craving and need ("If only I had that, I'd be happy").
3.  **The Animal:** The state of compelled, instinctual drudgery. Doing things we don't want to do but feel we have to, without reward (like a draft animal).
4.  **The Asura (Titan):** The state of paralyzing anxiety despite being prepared. All dressed up for battle but frozen by fear (e.g., stage fright, test anxiety).

These are not future lifetimes, but **present-moment psychological prisons we create through selfish reactions.**

### The Five Aggregates: The Components of "Personality"
The talk explains that what we call a "self" is a temporary, constructed system made of five aggregates (khandhas):
1.  **Body (Form)**
2.  **Feeling** (pleasant, unpleasant, neutral)
3.  **Perception** (labeling and recognition)
4.  **Mental Formations (Samskara)** (thoughts, habits, memories—especially emotional memories)
5.  **Consciousness (Vinnana)** (awareness of the senses)
The key insight is: **"You are not your personality."** You are not any of these parts, nor are you the sum of them. They are a temporary, interdependent system (like a chariot made of parts), and identifying with them as "me" or "mine" is the source of suffering.

### Practical Advice for Practice
*   **Separate from the Aggregates:** Practice seeing body, feelings, thoughts, and memories as **observed phenomena**, not as "self." For example, "There is anxiety" instead of "I am anxious."
*   **Don't Dwell in the Past:** Memory (Samskara) is unreliable and often filled with unwholesome material. Focus on the present moment and cultivate new, wholesome mental habits.
*   **Cultivate the Opposite:** If you've spent years talking yourself into feeling bad, now is the time to **talk yourself into feeling good**. Generate joy and happiness deliberately.
*   **See Selfishness as the Hindrance:** In any conflict or unease, look for the clinging to "I, me, mine." Letting go of that selfish stance is the path out of the woeful states.

### Conclusion & Preview
The talk concludes by emphasizing that understanding the five aggregates and how they combine (a process called **Paticcasamuppada** or Dependent Origination) will be the topic for the next discussion. This will explain how the process of selfishness and suffering is constructed moment-to-moment.

In essence, Dhammarato demystifies Anatta, moving it from a philosophical puzzle to a practical tool for recognizing and escaping the self-created "woeful states" of mind that arise from selfishness.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on this detailed conversation about Buddhism, language, and the nature of self, the speakers use several key **metaphors and stories**:

### **Metaphors:**

1.  **The Body as a House:** The body is compared to a house you live in, not the self. Just as a homeowner becomes a "fix-it man" for the house, we spend our lives maintaining a body that will eventually "fall apart." The point is to see the body as a temporary residence, not your identity.
2.  **Feelings as a Boss:** Feelings (like anxiety) are described as a boss that owns and controls you. The practice is to separate from them, to see "anxiety" not as "my anxiety" but as a temporary feeling that can be observed.
3.  **The Five Aggregates as a Chariot (or Car):** This is the story of Nagasena and King Milinda. The self/personality is like a chariot—it's a useful label for a system made of parts (body, feelings, perceptions, etc.), but if you take it apart, you can't find the "chariot" itself. Similarly, the "self" is a functional concept, not a solid, findable thing. The whole (the functioning person) is greater than the sum of its parts.
4.  **Atmosphere (Atmo) as Life-Force/Breath:** The speaker connects the Pali word *atta* (soul/self) to the Greek *atmo* (atmosphere). The atmosphere is the "breath of life" that is not "mine" but is essential. This metaphor reframes the debate about a permanent soul into a discussion of a shared, impermanent life force.
5.  **Polluted Air vs. Fresh Breeze:** Unwholesome states (driven by desire/aversion) are likened to polluted, smoky, foul air that's hard to see and breathe in. The Dhamma practice is compared to a fresh, cool, cleansing breeze.
6.  **Practice as if Your Hair is on Fire:** A vivid metaphor (attributed to Thanissaro Bhikkhu) for the urgency of spiritual practice. If your hair was on fire, you wouldn't hesitate or be lazy—you'd act immediately.
7.  **The "Pot of Gold Found in the Woods":** Used to describe the Dhamma (teachings). Good insights aren't "my" ideas to be proud of, but like a discovered treasure—you don't claim to have created it, you just found and share it.
8.  **Samskara (Memories/Habits) as "Garbage In, Garbage Out":** Our perceptions are polluted by imperfect past memories, leading to faulty conclusions in the present.
9.  **The Four Woeful States as Psychological Prisons:** The traditional Buddhist realms (hell, hungry ghosts, animals, asuras/titans) are presented not as literal places but as metaphors for selfish mental states:
    *   **Hell:** The hot, angry, desperate state of "I need to get out of here!"
    *   **Hungry Ghosts:** The state of insatiable need and greed—"I'd be better if I had that."
    *   **Animals:** The state of drudgery, doing what you don't want to do because you feel you have to (like a draft animal).
    *   **Asuras/Titans:** The state of being "all dressed up with nowhere to go"—paralyzed by fear or hesitation despite being prepared (e.g., stage fright).

### **Stories & Anecdotes:**

1.  **The Anxious Man and the Fence:** A story about a man who feels anxiety and tries to fix it by repairing his fence. The work distracts him, but the anxiety returns as soon as he stops. This illustrates the futility of addressing symptoms (external projects) instead of observing the feeling itself with detachment.
2.  **The Baby Shower Game:** A social game where attendees are forbidden from saying the word "baby." This is used as an analogy for the awkward and artificial practice of trying to avoid pronouns like "I" and "me" to embody *anatta* (not-self). The point is that mindful understanding is more important than linguistically correct speech.
3.  **The Origin of Rebirth as a Political Tool:** A historical story suggesting the Brahminical idea of reincarnation was a political maneuver to justify the caste system: "I am a Brahmin because I was good in a past life, and you are a low-caste because you were not."
4.  **Alexander the Great and Buddhist Statuary:** A historical anecdote about Greek influence (after Alexander's campaigns) introducing the tradition of Buddha statues, which were originally Greek in style.
5.  **The Evolution of the Steam Engine:** A story of slow innovation (from mine pumps to factory engines to locomotives) contrasted with the rapid evolution of the transistor (to computers to smartphones). This illustrates the danger of being stuck in old ways of thinking (past *samskara*) and the value of staying present and adaptable.
6.  **General McClellan in the U.S. Civil War:** Used as an example of the *asura* (titan) woeful state. McClellan built a powerful army but was too hesitant and fearful to use it effectively, much like someone with stage fright.

These metaphors and stories serve to make complex Buddhist philosophical concepts—*anatta* (not-self), the Five Aggregates, the nature of suffering, and rebirth—more relatable, practical, and grounded in everyday experience and historical context.
