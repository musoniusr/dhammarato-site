### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, so folks, welcome to the Saturday morning Thai time call. Today is the last day that we will be on Skype and we're moving over to Discord, so please join us there. Today it looks like we're in the process worldwide of changing clocks and some clocks have changed. Michelle, where are you? And.

**Speaker B:** You'Re saying— I'm in San Francisco, and actually the time changed last Saturday, so— but I think you guys, you know, since your time didn't change, it didn't— you know, everyone's an hour later now.

**Speaker A:** All right, so, um Today, uh, the first thing that we can, uh, talk about is, uh, fear and, uh, fear of action, fear of, um, all kinds of things. Now, one of the things that it would be good— hello, Ivan, good to see you. So one of the things that we can consider is, is that for most people, fear is very, very common, very often, that all kinds of things can bring on fear, even if we are, let's say, in a form of entertainment, that a lot of different entertainments like movies and news broadcasts and all of that, both of those and many other forms of entertainment, their business, their job is to make people afraid. Why? Because that keeps you curious and interested and keeps you watching. That in fact, this is also true for novels. And that possibly the easiest way to handle that would be to go to the last chapter of the novel, or to fast forward if you've got a VCR, or go to the last 5 minutes of the movie online and watch that. Because it's always at the end is where they do the resolution. Why watch all of the details building up to that. So in that regard, we can also see that we will ruminate and think about and try to figure something out. Let us say that you've got money coming in, but it didn't come in. It depends upon the agency, but you want to contact that agency, and it's hard to get through to them. Let's say that it's a government agent in the United States, like Social Security, that's being closed down, and we think and ruminate, and all my money, etc., like that. And that builds up fear. Now, one of the ways of looking at it is that adrenaline is a bodily component, and that fear therefore is a bodily component. You can feel the fear in your the body. Now, sometimes I've had students who would say when they're practicing Anapanasati that they feel uptight and anxious. What that really means is, is that they've been uptight and anxious for so much of the time, but they only notice it when they're quiet and sitting. And so I would ask the question Is this new anxiety or is this old stuff? And then upon reflection, everybody says, oh, this is old, this is familiar, but that I haven't been noticing it very much. And so how we can handle that kind of fear is the way that we would handle anything. But in fact, you could go so far as to say that almost all of our bad feelings have fear built into it, and that we stay afraid a lot. Now, I will say that fear is actually built in and part of our DNA. It's part of our body, it's part of the system, and that in the really, really old days, um, it was a matter of survival. In fact, the, uh, the instinct of survival, self-preservation instinct is there to keep us alive. It's wired in. And that the example I would give is, is that imagine that you and a mate, a friend, both of you in loincloth walking down an old path 100 or 300 or 400,000 years ago with a spear. And there is a rustle in the grass, in the bushes behind you, and one of you takes off running immediately and the other one turns around to see what it was. Guess who gets eaten? The one who is curious. Well, if we have that instinct of fear and immediately act upon it That's a survival mechanism. Now, in modern times, we are almost never in that instant survival position. And yet we can see that it also is in effect in the sense of you're walking down a city street and you see an alleyway. And you instinctively— and I'm talking about real instinct now— you instinctively don't go down that alley because it's probably possibly dangerous. There's a lot of activity that we learn that a very young child, for instance, might run right out into the road to chase a ball. But when Mommy calls and says, don't go out in the road to look for where you're going, that registers then. And we begin to watch for danger. So now we grow up and that any and everything can be a danger. Oh, I've got to go to the store to buy milk. And then we start ruminating about the price of milk and the dangers on the road. And now that fear mechanism is in play. And so it happens much of the time, much of the day. And so many people, especially in our society, we have the idea that any thought or any feeling that has this fear component in it means that we've got to go do something about it. We've got to go fix it right away. It's a motivating factor. And yet most of the stuff that we're afraid of are problems and dangers that we make up. They don't really exist. In other words, whether you feel afraid about the price of milk or the price of eggs doesn't change the price of the eggs. There's nothing you can do about it except being repelled and frightened by the price of eggs. So in that regard, this is what Anapanasati is about, is to look for the kinds of thoughts that bring up these kinds of feelings that we've got to go do something, that we ruminate on it. Oh, I've got to go get that problem fixed. Oh, I've got to go do it a second time or a third time. Oh, I've got to go check on my account at the bank. I had money come into the bank, or at least I sent money to the bank, and it should already be there. And so I've got to go check on it and maybe check 2, 3, 4, 5 times because why? We're worried, we're afraid. And so what we're practicing with Anapanasati is the possibility to remember to look at the kind of thoughts that we have and the kinds of feelings that that brings up and the attitude behind it that brings up those kind of thoughts, and also what those kind of thoughts do to affect the body, as well as when we have thoughts about the body. The body can have an itch or a scratch And many people will want to go run to the doctor because they feel something in the body. But in fact, doctors have a word for it called hypochondria, and that they want you to be a hypochondriac. They want you to come to the doctor for no reason at all so that the doctor has nothing to do except make some money off of you because you came to the doctor. With that, I'll tell you a story about medical school. It is well known that when a student— they do this more and more than once— they'll let us say a student will take 4 or 5 different classes studying 4 or 5 different classes of illness. And in each class, many of the students in that class will find symptoms in themselves that relate to the symptoms of the disease they're studying, or that they'll have somebody in their family that they think has got that disease. In other words, we are so afraid of disease that we will give ourselves the idea that we've got a disease, when in fact we don't have it at all. Most of the problems of life are made up. And this is just an example. And so when Vinaya asked about procrastination, that would be the hypochondriac saying, oh, I've got to go to the doctor. And then he goes to the doctor for no reason. Or I've got to go check on the bank account and I check on it 4 or 5, 6 times and I'm never satisfied. Oh, what if? And what if? Like this. And so by not procrastinating, we give ourselves a whole lot of stuff to do that we don't need to do. And when we do those actions like that, often it does not make us feel better because we're already in the habit of feeling that way. So what we're going to begin to practice, the Anapanasati practice, is actually based upon the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path. And we have to keep remembering that, that that's the only thing that the Buddha taught was the Four Noble Truths. He didn't teach about rebirth or what happens after death, or how did the world become, how things got started, Big Bang theories and things that happened a long time ago. Nor did he talk about anything way off into the future, what's going to happen. So in Buddhism, we have no prophecy. We've also got no scripture like a Bible that makes prophecies that we go around trying to see, are these fulfilled now? But in fact, the entire teachings of the Buddha have to do with what's happening right here, right now. And so this is what we need to start paying attention to, is what the mind is doing right here, right now. Now, when I say the mind, I'm actually talking about all four of the basic elements. Uh, the Anapanasati Sutta is based upon, uh, the four foundations of mindfulness. Which means that there are 4 things to continuously take into consideration, and that is the body and how the body is feeling, the feelings of the mind, which is actually quite related to the body. So we have the body, the feelings, and then our mental attitude. What is our state of mind? And then the last one is what kind of thoughts that we're having. So those are the four basic foundations of mindfulness and that they are in fact interrelated. They're all interrelated in the sense that your attitude affects the thoughts that you have, the thoughts you have affect the feelings, your attitude affects the feelings, the feelings will affect your attitude, the body will affect the attitude, and the attitude will affect the body. These are all interrelated. But we make sure that we're paying attention to on a regular basis all four aspects. And so by having the Four Foundations of Mindfulness as our guide, the place where we start as beginners is beginning to look at the kind of thoughts that we have. Why? Because those are the things that are easiest to change. You can change your mind instantly. The Buddha says the mind is so fast that he doesn't even have an analogy for how fast the mind is. Now, back in those days, they didn't have clocks that had second hands. They didn't have nanoseconds and picoseconds and all of that kind of stuff that modern science has. But he knew that there was no action that could be taken that was as fast as the mind, and he also says that the mind is the forerunner. So you could say then that the attitude that we have gives rise immediately to thoughts, that we'll see something and then we'll have thoughts about it, and then we'll have feelings about it, and that affects the body. Or we can have consciousness of the body and then have thoughts about it, and then I begin to feel bad. So all of these things are interrelated, and that if we're practicing correctly, we can begin to change those things. So the way that we practice the Eightfold Noble Path according to the Buddha is that looking is what we need to do. We need to look at what is happening right here, right now. Now, there is a thing called right view, an ordinary right view, and also wrong view. But almost always, wrong view is a story, a concept, a worldview, a way of looking at things. And that ordinary right view is also just a story. It's the opposite story. Basically, the story is, for those who have wrong view, is, oh, I could do anything that I want to and get away with it. If I'm smart enough, I can shoplift, I can dominate other people, I can tell a lie like the dog ate my homework. And have the attitude that that will do, that we can get away with it. And then ordinary right view is basically the opposite of that. Oh no, you can't get away with it. They're the ones who have rebirth and reincarnation as a belief system in the sense that no matter what, you can't get away with it, that your actions will follow you into the grave. Into the next womb, into the next life. You can't get away with it. And this is the way that they teach children. But that teaching actually creates fear. That is well known now in Christianity, that when they teach children the concept of hell and you're going to go to hell and you're going to get punished, that makes the children afraid. And sometimes you can even call it child abuse. Because you put terror into the mind, into the belief system of the child. But what we're practicing here is not a concept, it's rather a verb in the sense of looking. So it's not a view, it's a viewing. And what we're going to be looking at or viewing is what's happening right now in the sense of the feelings, in the sense of the attitude, in the sense of what the body is doing, and in the sense of, uh, in the beginning, what our thoughts are. So if we are able to remember on a regular basis to keep looking at what we're doing, that gives us an opportunity to change what we're doing. Wow. You know, most of Western Buddhism is different than the actual teachings of the Buddha because they leave that one point off. And it's possibly, as part of the trio, it's an integral part of remembering to often look at what we're doing and then make a change to it. So if you have a thought of, oh, I've got to go do this and oh, I've got to go do that, that, oh, I've got to go do something, is basically based in fear, and that we don't see that fear. And so we go take that activity that we probably didn't have to do. So if we can remember to look at what we're doing, we can see those kind of thoughts of the mind as unwholesome. So I'm going to introduce the idea of most of the thoughts that we have are unwholesome, and they're unwholesome because they're either ruminating about the past or planning for the future. And that what we do is, is that we give ourselves new thoughts about the present moment, that right now The present moment is actually okay. Everyone, whether you're sitting, Samatha, in your car, or whether you're sitting in your room, or Ben, you're strolling around your garden or whatever, there is no danger there right now. Is no danger. So there is right now nothing to fear. And if there is nothing to fear, then that means that there's nothing to do. If you're— if there is no nothing to fear, and we feel like that, and we know that is the case, that we know that there is nothing to fear, then that will help us to stop being in the habit of being in fear. So if we can change that habit by one thought at a time, we can become having the sense of well-being, the sense of safety, security, and comfort. That we can bring comfort to the body by stop making it afraid, by stop having thoughts that bring up fear. Also, when we were born, we were raised from birth— in fact, every baby is born with the attitude of being dependent, that we're victims. And then when we grow up to 2 years old, we begin to strive for independence. And as that happens, we often get slapped down. The psychologists call it the terrible twos or the toddler tyrant. And so by the time that the child is 3, he is making decisions that are based in fear. And so we grow up with that feeling of fear and also that feeling of being dependent, dependent upon my mommy and my daddy, dependent upon our teachers. And as we gain age, we become dependent upon our peer groups and dependent upon all kinds of things. And then when we're adults, we begin to get dependent upon some god, or some religion, or some mentor, some teacher, some guru, or some accountant, some lawyer. In other words, we begin that sense of being dependent, not interdependent, but dependent. And that dependency then is the attitude of the victim, to where the attitude of a winner is, "I can handle this, I don't need any help to it." And so I'll bring up the point that in fact, fear is almost always based in doubt. You don't know what's going on, and you probably heard, it's actually quite famous, is the idea of fear of the unknown. If we don't know what it is, it might be dangerous. And so we have a kind of a constant doubt about what's going to happen, etc., like this. So go ahead, Ivan, you got a question?

**Speaker C:** That's a question, just a statement. I find it very helpful to to just watch myself, like that part of me is like really like saying, oh, I need to depend on someone right now. And I just keep looking at that, that part, that sensation, that, that voice, that old personality. I find it very beneficial to just keep looking at it.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. So there is a kind of fear, we are doubt Let's say that it comes in 3 groups or 3 different levels. And the first level that everyone generally is before they start practice is the level of doubt of, who can I get to fix me? I'm broken. Who can I get? Can I get a teacher? Can I get a guru? Can I get a technique? Can I get something? Because I can't do it on my own. But in fact, now that I've been on Discord for a while, looking around, I see a lot of people actually go in on the Discord saying how broken they are, hoping that by posting it, I can't do this and I can't do that, that somebody is going to come by, give them just the right advice to fix them. Now, uh, what this is, is that we don't understand that nobody's going to help us. And so we have to get over that level of doubt about who is going to help us, because nobody's going to help you. Nobody can read your mind. It's possible that a child can practice the piano and then go to the teacher the piano lesson, and the teacher can hear the piano and watch the piano being played and see the little fingers playing and start to make some changes. But when you're sitting all alone or sitting in a group of meditators, nobody can read your mind. Nobody can help you. Then all of the work we have to do ourselves. And in fact, this fits in directly with the Second Noble Truth. So the First Noble Truth is that there is dissatisfaction, there is fear, there is disappointment, there is longing. All of these things exist, but they don't have to. Many people have the idea that life sucks and then you die. But it's also quite possible that life sucks because you're sucking. You're sucking on something thinking that it's going to help you. And when you stop sucking on something, then life doesn't suck anymore. So life sucks only because we're sucking, because we want something, we want help, and the help is not going to come from anybody. Not your grandma, not your preacher, not your guru, nowhere. That we have to be able to get over that level of doubt So that we can see that in the Second Noble Truth, the cause of Dukkha, the cause of dissatisfaction, is in fact our own ignorance, our own stupidity, our own delusions about what will help us and what will not. These are also based upon feelings. And so the language is lust or greed and ill will. But those are pretty strong words. You could say it in the sense of liking and not liking, and we do that ignorantly. If we like a car, then we want the car, thinking that the car is going to make me feel better, until you get the car and then you've got payments, and then you want somebody to make the payments, want payments to go away. We also don't like the car getting dinged. We want the dings to go away. So this is all ignorance, but it's stronger than ignorance— it's delusional. And so if we can begin to see the Second Noble Truth, is that all of our longing, all of our desires, all our fears come from The fact that we don't know what we're doing, we do this ignorantly, we do this delusionally, that also, that Second Noble Truth points out that our dissatisfaction doesn't come from the outside, it comes from the inside, our own delusion, our own desires, our own dislikes. That's liberating. That's liberating to figure out that I'm the one who is causing my own problems. Nobody else is causing it. But that then brings up the second doubt, and the second doubt is, am I up to the task of fixing it? That's still the victim's mentality. And when we begin to get over that, when we begin to get success in the practice of the Dharma, when we begin to gain success in being able to change the mind, then that gains us the confidence to change our attitude from being a victim into being a winner. So the winner is going to say, that's all right, I don't need to go fix anything to feel better. I could just feel better without having to go fix it. In that regard, you could say that good practitioners of the Dharma, elderly monks, people who have been around for a long time, they don't have nearly as much activity as children and young adults. Young adults are so active doing their stuff is because they think that the doing is going to fix them. When they recognize that there really is not much to do anymore, then they stop doing it. In fact, the Buddha, when he was asked about Kamma, or when he talked about Kamma, normally, Kamma, which is defined as action, and that there is a law. This law is, by the way, a Hindu law. It's not a Buddhist law at all. The law of the Hindus is basically the same as the law of the Christians, with a different point of view. And that is, good action gives good results and bad action gives bad results. If you act badly, you're going to go to hell. So the Christians say, and if you act good, then you can get God's mercy and then you'll go to heaven. So you can see that, that you'll get God's mercy is the same thing as being dependent again. And so we, we act with the motivation of trying to show off, to try to get somebody to help us. To where when we recognize that only we can help ourselves, each one of us cannot help each other until we can begin to change our own mind. Now, we can in fact help each other in a noble sense, that we can demonstrate a healthy attitude to help other people remember that they can also have a healthy attitude. But if you're around most people, most people have an unhealthy attitude, an unwholesome attitude, that they need help. And so we see them and we say, oh, they need help, and I know I need help, so we're all in the same boat, as opposed to having noble friends who are demonstrating that they don't need help, and that gives each one of us then the idea, I don't need help either, I can do it by myself. So we can change this attitude. Now, what the attitude change is, is basically going from, oh no, there's a problem that has to be solved, into the attitude of, hey, I've got that wired. Anything that happens, I can take care of it. And so we begin to lighten up. We begin first off to see that almost all the dangers that we have in life are dangers that we made up. When we begin to have that knowledge, when we begin to have that understanding— somebody asked a question about What do we need to know? So the first thing that we need to know is that nobody's going to help us. That's the Second Noble Truth right there. Another part of the Second Noble Truth is called Dependent Origination, also referred to as in the Pali, Paticcasamuppada. That's the Thai word. Or Paticcasamuppada, and that that dependent origination means that things happen in a sequence that bring us into that state of dissatisfaction. In other words, this is a teaching about how the mind works. And so this is something that we need to understand. When we really understand the Four Noble Truths, what we're really understanding is how the mind works. With that, then we can actually watch how the mind works. We can see it in action. We become little scientists that are experimenting and seeing the reality of the situation over and over and over again. That someone has asked me just recently, uh, do I believe in this or that? And the answer is, I don't believe in belief. I believe in evidence that is easily repeatable. If you can easily repeat the information, if you can easily repeat the evidence, then there's no need for belief. That's not belief, that's knowledge. And so what we can say then is the real practice of the teachings of the Buddha is to give up belief and start working with reality, start working with real clear evidence. And that evidence has to be looked at over and over again. It's easily repeatable to keep looking and seeing that there is nothing to fear. There's no place to go, nothing to do. And in that regard, maybe the society will say, oh, well, that's procrastination. Well, if you got nothing to do and no place to go and there's nothing to fear, then procrastination is wonderful. It's wonderful. You don't have anything to do. Most of the activities that you've done in your life didn't get you anything. Um, here's an example of what I'm talking about, that you go to class, you go to a university and you sit in class, and while you're in class, the teacher is teaching a subject, but the mind of the student is off someplace about, "Well, what have I got to do, and where am I going to go?" Then in fact, one of the things that I did was, when I would have homework, I would wait till I got to school, and then the homework that I would do, I would do for the next class. So I'd sit in the first class and do the homework for the second class, and not paying any attention to what the teacher was same. Also, people who take notes in class often only take notes for what they hear, but most of the time they're taking notes and they're not listening to the teacher. So what I learned to do eventually was to pay attention in class, listen to what's being said right now, take it in right now, and then later we don't have to study because we already know. The worst case would be cramming for an exam. The kids stay up all night studying for the exam tomorrow, and then they walk into the exam all fearful and tired and don't do a good job because they weren't listening in the first place. If we would listen to what's happening in class in the first place, then we wouldn't have the anxiety about the exam. It would be a piece of cake. We already know what's going to be on the exam. We heard the teacher talking about it. So this is a new attitude that we have, is the attitude of the winner. We can do this. This is not easy. This is not hard. If we develop that attitude, we can do that over and over again. That's most of the path. That, in fact, the Buddha says that, and this is in the Kosambhian Sutta number 48, that he says that when the student knows without a doubt that no matter how obstructed the mind becomes, no matter what hindrance, no matter what fears, no matter what attitudes, no matter what pain comes up in the mind, that the student knows that he can get rid of that, he can throw that out, and come into the state of seeing reality, seeing the truth of the matter as it is. This is, the Buddha says, the first step of nobility, is to have that attitude of "we got this." There's nothing that's going to prevent me from seeing reality as it is, and reality as it is, by the way folks, is really nice. The hells and the heavens and all of that kind of stuff is just mental attitudes and fears and longing to where the actual paradise, the actual reality, is right here in front of us. This is good whether you're sitting in a car or sitting in a jungle like, um, Ivan, or sitting on the porch like Mikey, or sitting in your room, wherever you are. There's really nothing to do and no place to go because everything is really nice. Reality is good stuff. But our fears, our ideas, our concepts, our rumination of the past, our planning for the future— that is dissatisfaction. That's Dukkha. We create our own hells. And when we see ourselves doing that, guess what? Aha, I see that. I see that I'm doing that, and then I can change that attitude back to, I can do this, I can develop that. That in fact, there's a Pali word called Saddha. The Sanskrit version of it puts an R in there, Shraddha. And what that means is confidence, that when you practice over and over and over again, when you see reality over and over and over again, then that builds confidence. When we do not see but we think, that builds beliefs, and beliefs are unwholesome because they're not based in reality. And so the word would be faith. We take things on faith means that we're stuck in deep ignorance, we're stuck in delusion. So you could say then that there is a thing called wise ignorance, and wise ignorance is that you don't know something and you know that you don't know it. And then there is foolish ignorance, and worse than that is delusion, and worse than that of all, the worst of it, is faith, because faith then is that which keeps us fearful because we don't know what to believe. So the question then is about knowledge—what it is that we need to know, what is it that we need to understand. Ultimately, we need to understand what's happening in the mind right now so that we can change it. And if we do change it, then we know right now that everything is okay. That's the real knowledge, the real understanding, is that everything's all right, everything is fine, not a worry in the world. This is in fact a way of looking at enlightenment. Now, the word enlightenment has kind of gotten stuck on to Buddhism. The word enlightenment doesn't appear anywhere in any suttas. Then in fact, real enlightenment was but I say a revolution. The French Revolution was part of it, and this was a time the Enlightenment was getting out from under the thumb of the Catholic Church that wanted you to believe in all kinds of stuff. And so this word Enlightenment has kind of been grafted onto Buddhism, and everybody's got their idea of what Enlightenment is. But almost always, the idea of what enlightenment is, is something magical. We live in kind of a magical society. The magic is that, oh, I need help and I can get somebody to do it for me. That's the basic form of magic. Prestidigitation means to be able to fool people. So the charlatans, The magicians, the priests, and all, they want to fool you into believing that they can do things that you can't do, bringing up longing and wonder. So where the real teachings of the Buddha is, no, we need to do something directly. And so we can use this word enlightenment in the following way. It's got two qualities to it. And the Buddha, by the way, talks about these two qualities often. The first one is knowledge. Well, isn't knowledge because we turn the lights on? It's daylight. So that's the first form of enlightenment, is to be able to see things clearly because we're looking. So the second one, form of enlightenment, is once we can see what's heavy, We could set it down, we could become light. And so if we use the word enlightenment, always use it in the form of knowledge of what's heavy so that we can deal with it directly by setting it down, pushing it away, changing it. And when things get light, because we can see clearly, guess what? We don't have to deal with heavy things. We don't have to go fix heavy things. We don't have to have so many problems or things to do. So when the Buddha talked about Kamma, remember we talked about the Kamma of you do good things and you get good results, you do bad things and you get bad results. The Buddha put a third kind of Kamma in there, and that's a mixed bag, that there is almost never any particular activity that we have that doesn't have both good and bad elements to it. An example of that is the doctor wants to learn to become a doctor to practice medicine in order to help people, but he also wants to do it to get rich. And so that's an example of— and there's many examples. In fact, almost all action that you take is a mixed bag. Very rarely is there a true doing good. Almost always it's, I want payback. It's a business deal. I want results from my good action. So the Buddha says that not only is most action mixed, but there's a fourth kind of action, and that fourth kind of action is neither good nor bad, but it has the quality of bringing to the end of action. Now, this is in Sutra number 57 in the Majjhima Nikaya, called the Dog Duty Aesthetic, where the Buddha talks about it in the sense that it brings the end of action. So there is procrastination for you. If you are able to see things clearly, you're not out to get something by doing good action, nor you were afraid of any bad action because you're with bad results because you're not doing anything. So by not doing anything, you're not doing any action at all. And that brings about then eventually the habit of doing very little. Have fun in your life. And a way of thinking about that is that any job that you have, any work that you perform, almost all of the work that we ever do because of the way that we're trained in society We do it and don't like it. Almost nobody likes their job. But if we can do it correctly by having a really wonderful, nice attitude, then anything that we do is actually a toy to play with, so that we just enjoy our lives. We don't have to go do anything. So this is another instance of if you have the right knowledge then the right knowledge is that there's nothing to do. Let's just have fun. Let's just enjoy our lives. And that's basically all there is to it. But we have to practice this over and over and over and over again because we're in such a deep habit of doing. We're in a deep habit of doing things out of fear about having problems, about having worries, about having things to solve and things that we've go do instead of just enjoying our life. Um, we talked about this yesterday, Samatha, that you said that you loved your kid to death, and I cautioned you about that, that because loving them to death will actually kill them because we're trying to control them, that we want our child to be wonderful, and so we force him to be wonderful and we wind up making him miserable. That the right way to deal with a child, if you've got one in your care, is to play with him, become his friend, teach him to enjoy his life, and let him make his own decisions based upon lack of fear. But let him play his way through life, make it easy for him. So this is the way that the practice of the teaching of the Buddha— this is what we really need to know is how to enjoy being alive. So we'll finish this now. Who has any questions about this? How about you, Michelle? What do you think?

**Speaker B:** No, it's very, very helpful, um, since we live in kind of a culture that's always pushing the the doing, right? And just the sense of like, you have to live life to the fullest. And I think that can be hard, that, you know— Well, doesn't that bring.

**Speaker A:** In the fear that you're not living your life to fullest? And who needs to live it full? Why can't we just live it easy?

**Speaker B:** I know. And I understand that. So I guess I have— what did you say it was? Like wise ignorance? Like, I understand that, but I still fall prey to that thinking.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Okay, so be aware of that. Start looking at that thinking. Remember to look at that thinking, because if you can see that— think that I could think everything's okay right now, right? This is the real teaching of the Buddha, that you have to be able to look at what you're doing And you have to remember to look at what you're doing and then make a change to it. If we can make that change over and over again, then we feel good. We feel safe and secure and comfortable. And best of all, then satisfied. Well, if the whole teaching of the Buddha is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, then isn't that dissatisfaction becomes satisfaction? And voilà, if you're satisfied, if you're content with your life, then your life is marvelous. That's the heaven that we build. It's fine, everything is great. Go ahead, Ivan.

**Speaker C:** I just realized, for me personally, uh, I just realized, like, living life to the fullest, that's what society says, really sounds like a good term. Well, for me, because it has a lot of fear in it. It's almost like you're missing out on something.

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker C:** So much fear.

**Speaker A:** But that's what everybody has. They have that feeling of missing out on something. That's what creates jealousy, envy, comparing ourselves to other people. But if you feel comfortable and happy and satisfied, you don't go around comparing yourself to other people. So Simon, do you have something to say? No, I'm good. Sounds good. All right, Grant, thank you for joining us. I've been watching you. What do you have to say?

**Speaker C:** You've actually referred to some things that apply to the questions I had. 2 things. First of all, something called empathetic distress, when we become upset when other people are struggling. And that seems like it's a fight or flight response that kicks in even though we're fine. We take on the feelings of other people. That can spin out into problem solving and getting really caught up in it. And it's just noticing that and saying, "Ah, I spot that. I see that I am safe and that I can't fix that situation by becoming overwhelmed by it. That's quite a challenge sometimes, but when you spot it, it's a good feeling because then it goes away again.

**Speaker A:** Everything's fine. And when we remember to look, we can spot it a whole lot easier, and then we can do something with it. We can change our— that, that feeling. Okay, that's very good, Grant. Welcome. I hope that you join us on Discord. Um, on the Dharma Friends group. We'll be doing these calls there. Also, everybody be sure to friend both Mikey and the, uh, here on, uh, and myself so that we can, uh, have good, um, one-on-one dialogues and whatnot. So, uh, Kasi, what do you think? Samatha, go ahead. Oh, I don't have anything. Don't worry, be happy. Don't worry, be happy. Exactly. Hello, Dhamma Dolls, I'm glad you're here. Thanks for joining us. Go ahead. How you doing? Oh, I'm sitting here just doing, just doing nothing. That's what I'm doing. Nice, me too. All right, so does anybody have anything else to say? I'm really glad that you've come. I really enjoy these talks. Samatha, be sure to join us on Discord. And so, Mikey, what do you have to say? Yeah, for those of you watching this on YouTube, you can find a link to join the Discord in the video description. And like Dhammarato had mentioned, we're looking for people that have laptops and computers who can run the software OBS to record our calls on Discord. So if you're someone who can do that, please reach out to me or Dhammarato and we can get you connected. So yeah, thank you for this Dhamma talk today. It's been quite the joy. Ivan, did you get your laptop fixed?

**Speaker C:** Uh, you know, uh, it's already fixed. It's just, uh, I'm gonna test it again later on this. Yeah, okay, maybe I can.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I saw that Nike had given you the very easy instructions, but when people are unfamiliar with that software, those really, uh, short, easy instructions bring confusion and we're not sure. So talk to Mikey again about how to do OBS. It's actually very easy to set it up. All right, well, thank you guys. I really appreciate it. This has been a good— and really, Grant, thank you for coming.

**Speaker C:** Thank you, everyone.

**Speaker A:** And Simon, thank you for coming. We'll see you.

**Speaker C:** Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with Sangha friends, focuses on **understanding and overcoming fear through the lens of the Buddha's core teachings**. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: Fear as a Habitual Response**
- Fear is a universal, deeply ingrained human experience, often triggered by entertainment (movies, news), rumination about problems (like finances), and uncertainty.
- Physiologically, fear is linked to adrenaline and is an ancient survival mechanism. However, in modern life, this instinct is often activated unnecessarily by imagined dangers and worries.

### **The Practice: Anapanasati & The Four Foundations of Mindfulness**
- The practice of mindfulness of breathing (Anapanasati) helps reveal how often we are already anxious or fearful—it’s not new, but we notice it more in stillness.
- The framework is the **Four Foundations of Mindfulness**: body, feelings, mind (attitude), and mental objects (thoughts). These are interconnected; a change in one affects the others.
- We start by observing thoughts because they are the easiest to change. By noticing unwholesome thoughts (usually past rumination or future planning), we can replace them with the recognition that **in this present moment, there is no danger**.

### **Key Dhamma Insights**
1.  **Fear is rooted in doubt and dependency**: We often operate from a "victim mentality," believing we need external help (teachers, gurus, institutions). The Buddha’s teaching emphasizes **self-reliance**—you must do the work yourself.
2.  **The Four Noble Truths as a practical guide**:
    *   **First Noble Truth**: Dissatisfaction (Dukkha), including fear, exists.
    *   **Second Noble Truth**: The cause is internal—our own ignorance, craving, and aversion. This is liberating because it means the solution is within our control.
    *   **Third & Fourth Noble Truths**: There is an end to suffering via the Noble Eightfold Path.
3.  **From Belief to Knowledge**: The path is about replacing belief and faith with **direct, repeatable observation** of how your mind works. Confidence (Saddha) comes from seeing this reality again and again.
4.  **"Enlightenment" as Clarity and Lightness**: Redefined not as a magical state, but as:
    *   **Knowledge**: Seeing things clearly ("turning the light on").
    *   **Lightness**: Letting go of burdens once you see them.
5.  **Right Action and "Procrastination"**: Much action is driven by fear. The Buddha taught a type of action that leads to the **end of action**—a wise "procrastination" where, seeing clearly, you realize there is often "nothing to do and no place to go." True practice leads to enjoying life as it is, not constantly *doing* to fix imagined problems.

### **Practical Advice & Takeaways**
- **Watch your thinking**: Notice thoughts that create fear and replace them with the recognition of present-moment safety.
- **Cultivate a "winner's attitude"**: Shift from "I need help" to "I can handle this; I can change my mind."
- **Enjoy life**: The ultimate goal is to find satisfaction and contentment right now, not in frantic activity or future achievement. Life becomes a playful engagement rather than a problem to be solved.
- **Noble friendship**: Surround yourself with people who demonstrate this self-reliant, calm attitude—it encourages your own practice.

The talk concludes with a practical note about moving their group calls to Discord and an encouragement for all practitioners to observe their minds, let go of fear-based doing, and find ease in the present.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several core **metaphors and stories** to illustrate the teachings on fear, mindfulness, and Buddhist practice. Here’s a breakdown:

---

### **1. Metaphors**

**A. The “Novel or Movie” Metaphor**  
- **Metaphor**: Fear and anxiety are like the plot of a novel or movie—they build tension to keep you engaged, but the resolution only comes at the end.  
- **Purpose**: To suggest that we often endure unnecessary mental suffering by focusing on the “build-up” of worries instead of skipping to the “resolution” (realizing there’s nothing to fear in the present moment).

**B. The “Ancient Survival Instinct” Metaphor**  
- **Metaphor**: Fear is like an ancient survival mechanism—like hearing a rustle in the bushes and running instead of turning to look (which could get you eaten).  
- **Purpose**: To explain how fear is hardwired into us for survival but is now misapplied to modern, non-life-threatening situations (e.g., worrying about milk prices).

**C. The “Hypochondriac” Metaphor**  
- **Metaphor**: Our tendency to ruminate and seek solutions to imagined problems is like a hypochondriac going to the doctor for non-existent illnesses.  
- **Purpose**: To illustrate how we create unnecessary tasks and anxieties based on fear, not reality.

**D. The “Heavy vs. Light” Metaphor for Enlightenment**  
- **Metaphor**: Enlightenment is not a mystical state but like **turning on a light** (seeing clearly) and **becoming light** (setting down burdens).  
- **Purpose**: To demystify enlightenment and frame it as a practical process of clear seeing and releasing mental heaviness.

**E. The “Student Cramming for an Exam” Metaphor**  
- **Metaphor**: Living with anxiety about the future is like a student cramming for an exam because they didn’t pay attention in class.  
- **Purpose**: To show how being present and attentive now eliminates future fear and struggle.

**F. The “Life Sucks Because You’re Sucking” Metaphor**  
- **Metaphor**: Dissatisfaction (dukkha) is not inherent in life but comes from “sucking” on desires and fears—like sucking on a straw that’s empty.  
- **Purpose**: To emphasize that suffering is self-created through craving and ignorance.

---

### **2. Stories & Anecdotes**

**A. Medical School Story**  
- **Story**: Medical students studying diseases often start imagining they or their family members have those symptoms—even when they don’t.  
- **Purpose**: To show how the mind creates problems based on suggestion and fear, not reality.

**B. The Buddha’s Teaching on Kamma (Action)**  
- **Story/Explanation**: The speaker contrasts the Hindu/Christian view of karma (good actions → good results, bad actions → punishment) with the Buddha’s more nuanced teaching: most actions are mixed, and there is a fourth kind of action that leads to the **end of action** (freedom from compulsive doing).  
- **Purpose**: To highlight that Buddhist practice aims at reducing fruitless activity driven by fear, not accumulating “good karma.”

**C. The “Toddler Tyrant” Story**  
- **Story**: Around age two, children strive for independence but are often “slapped down,” leading to decisions based on fear by age three.  
- **Purpose**: To trace the roots of our habitual fear and dependency to early childhood conditioning.

**D. The “Dog Duty Ascetic” Sutta Reference**  
- **Story**: Reference to a sutta (MN 57) where the Buddha describes action that leads to the cessation of action.  
- **Purpose**: To support the idea that true practice leads to doing less, not more, and finding ease instead of striving.

---

### **3. Recurring Analogies**

- **Fear as a Bodily Sensation**: Like adrenaline that we feel in the body, often unnoticed until we sit quietly in meditation.  
- **Thoughts as Fast and Changeable**: The mind is faster than any physical action; thoughts can be changed instantly.  
- **Society’s “Living Life to the Fullest” as Fear-Based**: The pressure to “live fully” often stems from fear of missing out, not genuine enjoyment.  
- **Dependency as Victimhood**: Relying on gurus, teachers, or gods keeps us in a “victim” mindset instead of becoming self-reliant “winners.”

---

### **Overall Theme**
The metaphors and stories collectively paint a picture of **fear as an outdated survival tool that now creates self-imposed suffering**. The path of mindfulness (Anapanasati) and the Four Noble Truths is framed as a practical way to see through this habit, stop unnecessary “doing,” and find contentment in the present. The speaker emphasizes **seeing clearly** and **setting down burdens** over mystical beliefs or complex rituals.
