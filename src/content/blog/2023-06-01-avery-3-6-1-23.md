### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Are painful. What happens? So anyway, the thoughts that you're having are painful. If you stop having those thoughts, that's a relief. Now, what our society has taught us is to be critical of ourselves, to be in a state of wanting to improve, wanting to get better. Wanting to get more degrees, get more paper, get more adulation, get more money, get more goods. That's what our society is built on. It's called capitalism. And capitalism is a system to where everybody is miserable. 100% of the population of capitalism is miserable. Now there's a lot of people who are in the capitalistic society who do not have the capitalism mentality. But you could say that capitalism— by the way, the word capital means money. It does not mean like capital city or capital punishment. It means capital investment. You understand that? That's what capitalism is. It's all about the money. And our whole society is a capitalistic society. Now, not all societies are capitalistic. In fact, some societies are called honor-based. The thing that's very interesting about a capitalistic society is based upon guilt. The guilt is that I don't have enough. I don't have enough of this, I don't have enough of that, I don't have enough education, I don't have enough— whatever it is. And so we find up feeling guilty and having thoughts of greed and ill will. And we do this completely ignorantly. So you're beginning to wake up. You're beginning to wake up to the fact that you're hard on yourself.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, for sure. I, uh, I'm trying. I really need to— I really would like to be able to just, you know, not do that.

**Speaker A:** Well, then do it. Just chill out, because it's easy enough to do. You've chilled out maybe 10,000 times in your life, but you've also been hard on your life maybe 100,000 times, maybe a million. Okay, but you can be easy on yourself. You can be nurturing. If you weren't ever nurturing with yourself, you would already be gone, you'd already blown it off. Young people kill themselves, and old people let injuries and body sensations, etc., do it for them. But there's only one way out of a bad life, and that's a bad death. But you can change it. You don't have to have it as a bad life. But capitalism takes us in that direction of wanting more, wanting more education, wanting more physical goods, wanting more government, better government. Everything has to do with want, want, want, want, want. And what we're learning here is to stop being critical in a sense of loss and start being okay the way things are. And so you can just change your mind and say, well, I'm glad I don't have to think about that criticism anymore. Wow, I can nurture myself. Wow, everything is okay. Everything is all right in the present moment. You see, all of your life's problems and worries are either in the past or thoughts right now about in the future. But the right now, the actual right now, is okay. Right now, the room that you're in, I suppose the door is closed and you're safe. So begin to spend some time actually feeling safe. Get yourself into a safe place and feel safe. And the safety comes because the only thing that would be dangerous would be your own thoughts. Talking yourself into something about the past or the future. We're in fact right here, right now. Everything's okay, everything is fine. And this is why we keep talking about coming back to the present moment, is because the present moment is actually not bad. The paradise we live in is in this present moment. The air that you breathe is this breath, right in the present moment. And the present moment, not so bad. But your thoughts about the past and the future, thoughts about what you want, thoughts about what you should do, thoughts about who you want to be, is painful. But the way you are right now is okay. So start living in the present moment, and everything is all right. And you can tell yourself right now, everything is just fine. What a relief.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's crazy. It's weird because I kind of wonder what thoughts even are, like compare them to sensory experiences and being in the present. Like with sensory experiences is more, it's.

**Speaker A:** More— Let us define thought as any way that one can spend a mind moment. And a mind moment is well less than a second, okay? Somewhere down in the 100-200 millisecond range. 350 would be a slow reaction time. So in that time frame, you can have a flash of an image. In that time frame, you have time to say one word. Is it going to be a kind word, or is it going to be a critical word? So that's, that's a mind moment. In that mind moment, we can look, we can see. And normally what happens is we'll spend a mind moment looking and seeing, and then we'll spend 10, 20, 30 mind moments talking to ourselves about it, often in a critical way.

**Speaker B:** I see that as a problem.

**Speaker A:** I know it's not a problem once you see it, and calling it a problem is the problem, rather than recognizing this is the way the mind works because this is the way you've trained it, and you can train it in a new way.

**Speaker B:** To try to just keep having as many good mind moments as you can.

**Speaker A:** Well, remember is the key. To remember right now, to remember to wake up, to remember to come out of whatever thought systems that we're in and change those thought systems. Right now you're not skilled enough to just merely stop, but what you can do is change direction. Very much like a great big ship, you know, a huge cruise or a big cargo ship or maybe an aircraft carrier, those big ships, guess what? They got no brakes. They got no brakes. The mind has no brakes. But what they can do is that they can steer the ship so that they don't run into the island. Okay, so what you can do is you can learn to steer your mind away from the unwholesome, steer it away from the storms, and cruise on down, boogie on down the road. But you gotta make a change. You gotta change your course, change your direction.

**Speaker B:** And that can happen fast, easy enough.

**Speaker A:** You can change your mind faster than the pilot can, uh, spin that wheel. Change that rudder, move things in another direction so that you steer around it. And so the critical thoughts, you can change that. Aha, critical thoughts! Never mind, I don't have to be critical of myself. Then you can have thoughts like You know, I actually do like myself. I'm an okay guy. I'm all right. Whatever happens, I've been able to survive it. Hasn't anything come by killed you yet? And it certainly hasn't killed you half a dozen times, though you might have felt that way. But the reality is, is that whatever you've done in the past isn't so terrible that it killed you. And so it wasn't so terrible after all. Here you are, still alive. So we can actually then find some gratitude for that. Wow, I'm still alive. I didn't clutch myself to death. I didn't walk over that ledge. I didn't punch out that mafia dude. I survived. Okay, so at least you can congratulate yourself for having survived up to this point.

**Speaker B:** That's good. That's a good place to start. Because it'll always work.

**Speaker A:** As long as you're still alive. And if you're not, then it don't matter anymore. But if you are still alive, you can congratulate yourself where you're still alive. Here's another way of looking at it. What's the most important thing to you? What's the most important thing?

**Speaker B:** That I'm still breathing? I don't know.

**Speaker A:** I guess that's— you heard— you probably.

**Speaker B:** Heard— I mean, I guess most— sorry.

**Speaker A:** You probably heard me say that.

**Speaker B:** Probably did. I'm not really sure how to answer that question, honestly.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker B:** What is the most important thing to me?

**Speaker A:** Maybe— well, being alive. No, no, being alive. If you were dead, what's your family?

**Speaker B:** Nothing relative to me, right?

**Speaker A:** If you had a prized, very expensive, very fast motorcycle, if you're dead, so what? Well, all right, so being alive is the only really important thing, and you've got that. You're alive, so you can congratulate yourself. At least you're still alive. And so here we are, we're still alive. Now we can take care of ourselves.

**Speaker B:** That's right.

**Speaker A:** You can nurture yourself and allow yourself to feel good because you're alive. Now, many people can live for many years without sex. People can live for sometimes weeks without food. We can live days without water. But you can't live without that breath. That in fact, everybody is going to die in the next 3 to 5 minutes unless they take a breath. Your breath is keeping you alive, so in that way it's worth appreciating, it's worth valuing, it's worth paying attention to. Making sure that you are breathing well, because normally when people are afraid or uptight, angry, whatnot like that, they're not breathing well. We go into a state of freeze. So paying attention to the breathing, coming back to the present moment. That's another part about it, is that if you're watching the breath, you can't watch last year's breath. You can't watch the breath that you take after you die. You can't do that. You can only watch this breath, this one, the one that's happening right here, right now. And if we watch the breath, or let us say pay attention to it, seeing it closely, That will bring us automatically into the here-now. That's kind of the trigger that we're looking for. Remember earlier we talked about triggers. What triggers you? Can be something that happens in the present moment. Somebody says something, you stub your toe getting into a car, getting shoved around, all the kind of things that happen to us will trigger us into bad feelings. But there's also the way of triggering us into bad feelings is by remembering an old event that triggered us. So if I've had an argument with Aunt Susie and I walk away and I sit down for meditation, I'll probably be thinking about Aunt Susie. That in fact, oh, those in a relationship, if they have an argument, they'll go and sit in meditation and they'll just rehash that old argument, trying to figure out a way of winning. Oh, if I only had said this to Aunt Susie, that would have won the argument. I'll tell her next time. And now we're already wasting our time, by the way, of not enjoying the present moment, that we're planning and scheming Anagami, on arguing with Aunt Susie. And when we do that, Aunt Susie comes up with something that we didn't expect, and she's got us again. So it's better not to argue with people, especially within our own mind. It is better just to come back to the present moment. And isn't it nice? Thank you, right now. You're still alive, you're still breathing, the sun is shining, the sky is blue, and all we have to do is pay attention to the fact that we're still alive. And we can breathe and enjoy just being alive. And when those old thoughts come back, catch them. Be on guard for them. Notice that you make yourself miserable when you think about the past and the future, and that you enjoy the heck out of right here, right now. And so that's the way to nurture ourselves, is we criticize ourselves with the past, but we can nurture ourselves with the present moment. And everything is okay, everything is fine, not a worry in the world, and we can relax. That whole quality of relaxation is the major part of the teaching of the Buddha. So we can just relax. Can you remember? That's the whole point, is can you remember? So what's happening?

**Speaker B:** I muted myself and forgot about it.

**Speaker A:** Hold on a second though.

**Speaker B:** I muted myself a while ago and forgot about it. I was going to mention that I feel like when people like me who are used to competition and, you know, all that capitalist stuff that you mentioned earlier, we try to take this like that. We're like, all right, how can I get better at this? But there is no getting better at it. There is nothing to worry about.

**Speaker A:** You're already there. You're already okay. Or as the Zen master will say to his students, you're already enlightened. Stop trying to get anything. Everything is already okay.

**Speaker B:** So if I find myself, it's sort of like I'll find myself enjoying the moment for a bit, and then there'll be a lot of thoughts where it's like I'll start slipping away, and then I just keep coming back to it. That's kind of—.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, if you can remember, that's the whole point. That's the new skill that you're learning, is to learn to remember to look. And when you see the unwholesome thoughts, when you see the, um, the fact that you're being critical with yourself, that the thoughts that you're having are pressurizing you— that a lot of people can understand the word depression by looking at the word itself. You can see the pressure in the word depression. And so when you're under a lot of pressure, that's being depressed. And almost all of the pressure is coming from your own unwholesome thoughts, because the reality of the moment is not pressure. That's not pressure.

**Speaker B:** Thanks, that helps a lot.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, go try that. Go practice. In fact, this is the whole point about meditation, is to get away from other people, get into seclusion, get alone by yourself, and sit there and talk yourself into being happy. You talked yourself into being miserable all these years. Now it's time to just sit down and talk yourself into being happy. What can you say? Everything's okay right now. Wow, I'm really glad I can relax.

**Speaker B:** I might do that right now.

**Speaker A:** So go practice that. Go practice feeling good. And give me a call in a couple of days. Don't wait so long next time, all right?

**Speaker B:** Don't wait so long.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, we'll see you, okay?

**Speaker B:** Okay. Oh wait, is this not going— this isn't going up on YouTube, is it? I don't know.

**Speaker A:** It doesn't matter. Let me talk to Scott. We'll talk later. Call me back.

**Speaker B:** Thank you, have a good day.

**Speaker A:** Okay, bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on the dialogue, this is a summary of the Dhamma talk between **Dhammarato (Speaker A)** and a **Sangha friend (Speaker B)**:

**Core Theme:** Overcoming self-criticism and societal conditioning to find peace in the present moment.

**Key Points:**

1.  **The Problem of "Capitalist Mind":** Dhammarato identifies the root of much suffering as the internalized mentality of capitalism—a system built on perpetual wanting (more money, status, goods, improvement) that generates guilt, greed, and ill-will. This conditions us to be constantly self-critical and dissatisfied.

2.  **The Present Moment as Refuge:** He emphasizes that while thoughts about the past and future are painful, **the actual present moment is always okay**. Right now, we are safe, breathing, and alive. Paradise is found by anchoring awareness in the "here and now," where nothing is lacking.

3.  **Practical Instructions:**
    *   **Stop Self-Criticism:** Consciously choose to stop the critical internal dialogue. Replace it with nurturing, grateful thoughts (e.g., "I'm an okay guy," "I'm glad to be alive").
    *   **Steer the Mind, Don't Brake It:** The mind has no "brakes" to stop thoughts instantly. Instead, learn to **steer it away** from unwholesome patterns toward wholesome ones, like changing a ship's course.
    *   **Use the Breath as an Anchor:** The breath is the most vital thing, happening only in the present. Paying attention to it automatically brings you back to the "here-now" and away from painful rumination.
    *   **Remember and Catch Yourself:** The essential skill is **remembering** to wake up from unwholesome thought loops. Catch yourself when you slip into criticism or planning, and gently return to the present.

4.  **Reframing the Goal:** The student's competitive, goal-oriented habit ("how do I get better at this?") is itself the problem. Dhammarato clarifies: **"You're already there. You're already okay."** The practice is not about achieving a future state but about recognizing the peace and adequacy available right now.

5.  **The Purpose of Meditation:** Meditation is framed as a time of seclusion to **"talk yourself into being happy,"** counteracting the lifelong habit of talking yourself into misery. It's a practice of relaxation, gratitude, and nurturing self-talk.

**Overall Summary:** The talk is a practical guide to undoing the conditioning of dissatisfaction and self-criticism. It teaches that relief is found not by acquiring more, but by recognizing the sufficiency and safety of the present moment, using mindfulness of breath and compassionate self-talk to steer the mind toward contentment and relaxation.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary speaker (Speaker A) uses several key metaphors and stories to illustrate their points about mindfulness, self-criticism, and escaping the pressures of a capitalistic mindset.

Here are the main metaphors and stories used:

### 1. **The Ship with No Brakes (Steering the Mind)**
*   **Metaphor:** The mind is compared to a massive ship (like a cruise ship, cargo ship, or aircraft carrier) that has **no brakes**.
*   **Purpose:** This illustrates that you cannot simply stop unwanted or critical thoughts instantly. Instead, like a ship's captain, you must learn to **steer** your mind away from unwholesome thoughts and "storms" (negative mental patterns) and toward a new, healthier direction. The emphasis is on gradual redirection rather than sudden stoppage.

### 2. **Capitalism as a System of Guilt and Want**
*   **Metaphor/Story:** Capitalism is presented not just as an economic system, but as a **mental and emotional system** built on a foundation of guilt ("I don't have enough") and perpetual wanting (more money, goods, status, education).
*   **Purpose:** It frames societal pressure and personal self-criticism as symptoms of this "capitalistic mentality." The story contrasts this with the idea of being "okay the way things are" in the present moment, positioning mindfulness as an antidote to this ingrained state of lack and desire.

### 3. **The Present Moment as Paradise / Safe Room**
*   **Metaphor:** The present moment is described as a **paradise** and a **safe room** where "the door is closed and you're safe."
*   **Purpose:** This creates a vivid contrast between the perceived dangers of past regrets/future anxieties (which exist only in thought) and the actual safety and acceptability of the immediate, sensory *now*. It encourages the listener to inhabit this "safe" mental space.

### 4. **Arguing with Aunt Susie (The Mental Rehash)**
*   **Story/Anecdote:** The speaker gives the example of having an argument with "Aunt Susie," then going to meditate only to mentally rehash the argument, planning what to say next to "win."
*   **Purpose:** This is a relatable story that demonstrates how we trap ourselves in past conflicts through repetitive, scheming thought. It shows the futility of internal arguments and serves as a concrete reason to "come back to the present moment" instead.

### 5. **Breath as the Anchor to the Present**
*   **Metaphor:** The breath is used as a **trigger** and **anchor**. You can't breathe in the past or future, only now.
*   **Purpose:** This provides a practical tool. Paying close attention to the breath is presented as an automatic mechanism to return to the "here-now," pulling you away from unwholesome thoughts about past or future.

### 6. **"Depression" as Pressure**
*   **Linguistic Metaphor:** The speaker breaks down the word **"depression,"** pointing out the word **"pressure"** inside it.
*   **Purpose:** This re-frames the experience of depression as being "under a lot of pressure," and posits that this pressure is largely generated by one's own unwholesome thoughts, not by the reality of the present moment.

### 7. **Survival and Self-Congratulation**
*   **Story/Narrative:** The speaker guides the listener through a narrative of recognizing their own survival: "Hasn't anything come by killed you yet?... Here you are, still alive."
*   **Purpose:** This story builds a foundation for gratitude and self-nurturing. It argues that since you have survived all past troubles, you can at least congratulate yourself for that and use it as a starting point to feel okay.

### 8. **The Hierarchy of Needs (Air is Most Critical)**
*   **Metaphor/Comparison:** While not explicitly named as Maslow's hierarchy, the speaker compares how long one can live without various things: years without sex, weeks without food, days without water, but only **minutes without breath**.
*   **Purpose:** This underscores the supreme, immediate importance of the breath and, by extension, the present moment. It makes the act of breathing something inherently worthy of attention and appreciation, as it is the very process keeping you alive *right now*.

**In summary,** Speaker A uses metaphors of **steering (ship), safety (safe room), and anchoring (breath)** to provide tools and perspective. They use **stories and re-framing (capitalism, Aunt Susie, survival)** to diagnose the problem of mental suffering and argue for a shift in mindset. The overarching narrative is one of moving from a state of guilt, want, and internal pressure to one of present-moment acceptance, self-nurturing, and relief.
