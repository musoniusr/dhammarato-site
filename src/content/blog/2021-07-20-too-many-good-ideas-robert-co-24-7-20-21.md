### Transcript


**Speaker A:** repeat a little bit about society. Yeah, so here you are out in the woods on an island off the coast of Washington State, you and your dog, and nothing to do and no place to go. And congratulations for that. That's enough of meditation. Starting to watch the mind now is basically all we've got left to do, because there's nothing much left to do once we leave away and say— actually, we can talk about it like this. When Danny was in Thailand, the idea was that when you're in Thailand, only have thoughts of being in Thailand. Not have thoughts about England, that you're not in England, don't think about England. So now that you're on the island, you can have thoughts about the island and what's happening on the island. I don't have thoughts about other place, someplace else. And in fact, to be here now, uh, being here almost requires the now. But what happens is that when we're thinking about someplace else, even in abstract time, no particular time with it, but when we're thinking about New York or Chicago or whatever, Miami Dolphins, it doesn't matter what we're thinking about, we're not thinking about right here, right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I actually had a great moment that reminded me of that today. I mean, the whole day was that, basically, but there's one moment in particular. So I was walking along the beach with Rocky, and there's this nice couple sitting right next to the water, and he went up to say hi to them. He's a very friendly dog, and they said hi, you know, etc. And I went over to say hi, and and they were looking at this rock, and it was a rock that— it was actually a piece of wood, but it looked a lot like a rock. And they were just commenting on this piece of wood. They were so interested in this piece of wood and why it was the way it was. You just talked about it for a few minutes, then I went on my day. And I was like, you know what, these people just really wanted— cared about this piece of wood. Like, that was what they cared about, you know. And like I was thinking back in my New York life, you know, like it would be— I'd be thinking about this person and that person and this event and all this, these complications, this and that, you know, whatever, need to do this, etc. But these people are just thinking about this piece of wood, you know. It's beautiful, that's great, you know.

**Speaker A:** Yes, and here that piece of wood is in the here-now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, it was right there.

**Speaker A:** Other places, other people, other times. Well, yeah, our society teaches us to do that.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Um, there's all kinds of stuff, including the sign 'plan ahead' where the sign didn't have enough room for the D.

**Speaker B:** Plan A, here.

**Speaker A:** You've seen those signs, "Plan ahead." Actually, that's not the point. That's missing the point in a way. Because a better way of doing that, instead of writing the word "plan ahead," they should be writing down, "Watch what you're doing." Or, "Look at what you're doing." Because if you look at what you're doing, then you'll have the letters spaced right.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so we're talking about planning ahead actually is quite dangerous.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** Another way of thinking, though, is to be prepared. Being prepared is not the same as planning ahead.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** It is a very, very good idea to plan— excuse me, to be prepared. Because if you're prepared, then you're prepared for anything. So when you plan ahead, then that means that everything has to go to plan or you've got a disaster because you didn't— you weren't prepared.

**Speaker B:** Sure. So I have a comment/question about that related to meditation. So a couple of things. So, and also being in nature. So one comment about being in nature is I've noticed that oftentimes when I'm in nature, the solutions to my problems emerge very spontaneously. Like just, it's like it comes from the woods almost. And I know it's my own mind, obviously, but like, you know, it's like I'll just be thinking, oh, that, you know, it just comes up. You know, it's like, oh, that's the solution. You know, it's really beautiful. I don't know why I noticed when I'm in nature.

**Speaker A:** Actually, that's the solution. Is a second thought.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes.

**Speaker A:** That's the follow-on thought, just trying to make those connections. The point is, is that there never was a problem. There was only an idea.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** And now we're trying to make that idea a solution to a problem, to in fact know it's just a good idea.

**Speaker B:** Sure. And then another thing too related to this is I've noticed when I do a long sit, my mind will naturally drift into, you know, whatever it is I have going on in my life, you know, like, oh, this girl or this job or whatever, you know. And I'll often find that I figure out the solution, you know, in meditation. And I figure, and I'm really happy about that. I'm like, oh, I figured that I had that today. I figured out something that was important to me. And I was like, oh, I figured that out. That was great. You know, I feel great now that I figured that out. But I think it's actually one step beyond that, to just not even go there and just be happy the whole time. But nonetheless, I do really enjoy finding the solutions to these problems. And I know when I do longer sits, sometimes it's an opportunity for for me to do that. And so I use the sit a little bit in that way, but I figure out a lot of stuff. And just one last little story here, you might like this. One time I had a— just hang

**Speaker A:** on, just hang on,

**Speaker B:** keep it for a minute. Okay,

**Speaker A:** we have to look at this issue, is that you told yourself something. You, one, you had a thought or an idea And then you told yourself something about how good that idea was, and then you felt good. Look at that. Whether or not that idea that you had is right, wholesome, beautiful, beneficial, we don't know at that moment. And that in fact, at a later time, you go to apply that, you may find that it didn't work.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** All right, that happens quite a lot, that people will have brilliant ideas, they're hopping up and down inside for joy that they finally figured it out, and then they feel good and content. All right, and then on another day at a later time or something, they go and they apply that idea that they had, and it didn't work.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, totally.

**Speaker A:** But that does not prevent them from having that aha moment. So what we need to look at is, is to stop looking for ideas that seem to be solutions to a problem and start looking for the fact that you can give yourself those ahas. Sure, this is a slight different change of it, but one of them is, is that something happened and an idea Number 2, what we're talking about is, is 'kaviyat diem,' to seize the day, or to seize the moment, in fact. And so that 'aha' that we have, that we feel so satisfied with, is actually an internal feeling, but it does not have to come from a brilliant idea. Other than perhaps the brilliant idea that we need to have is, wow, I could feel really good right now.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** So that's a brilliant idea, is that there are no problems. I've solved them all. Not just I solved one problem, but I've solved all the problems. That's the idea. That's a grand idea. And then we can get really wow over that.

**Speaker B:** You know, that is a grand idea, isn't it?

**Speaker A:** Well, I'm very glad to say, yeah, I'm trying to get that. This is part of teaching, right, is that if you have an idea that makes you feel really, really good because it's a solution to a particular problem or something, and you get a really wow and a really good feeling for that, then have this idea: you got no problems. Right now, that's an idea. No problems, they're all solved. Every single one of them is now defunct. It was automatically, uh, the solution had been already applied.

**Speaker B:** And it's right. No, I, I really hear you 100%, but I, I have to also say, you know, maybe call us devil's advocate or whatever, but I, you know, I sometimes have really good ideas, you know, in meditation, you know, like they just come up, like, and I'm really happy when that happens, you know.

**Speaker A:** Right, become happy. That's the whole point. That is having a whole bunch of different— huh?

**Speaker B:** Can I be happy and still come up with the ideas at the same time?

**Speaker A:** You don't need any ideas to be happy. It's the happiness is not dependent upon the ideas.

**Speaker B:** I get that, but I still like the ideas.

**Speaker A:** I know, and liking leads to clinging, and then when you don't have any ideas, you feel bad.

**Speaker B:** I think it's okay.

**Speaker A:** The solution to that is you don't need any ideas to feel good.

**Speaker B:** It's not the ideas.

**Speaker A:** It's not the ideas that's the source of the joy.

**Speaker B:** Sure, sure. The joy is the source of the joy.

**Speaker A:** Well, let us say at this particular time it was the liking, or perhaps the satisfaction, or the aha. Right, so start looking for these ahas. Start recognizing that you can create them directly, that you don't have to sit around and hope and wait for an idea to pop into your head, that in fact the only idea you need to pop into your head is, hey, I can feel good without any ideas.

**Speaker B:** Well, here's even one step further. Even just realizing that ideas are a hindrance creates an aha of joy. That just creates a little Anagami moment right there.

**Speaker A:** Exactly so! Exactly! That we are not dependent upon ideas, and that in fact, what we're talking about is common in many different professions. In the art world, especially designer art, writer's block, all of that kind of stuff. And people, when they don't have any ideas, they get really miserable.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** Which prevents them from having any ideas. If you had the idea of joy and you kept that going, the mind is going to come up with all kinds of really wholesome, wonderful, marvelous stuff.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** You begin to really see the way things are because you're really looking closely. And so there's basically one aha after another, aha after another, haha. There's nothing but ahas. But in now regards, it's no longer mentally generated ideas, but rather it's mentally recognizing the reality of the situation is that things are quite marvelous.

**Speaker B:** Sure. So here's an idea, pun intended, hahaha. So, so let's say like, you, let's say so for example, here's an idea that was useful for me today that I came up with. So I was thinking about writing my apology to my father, apologizing to my father, right? Because I talked to you about this, I haven't done it yet. And I had an idea that I was thinking one idea was to just write him a letter apologizing, just an apology letter. But another idea I had today was what I could do is just write him a letter saying, Dad, I'd like to apologize to you on the phone. You know, would you please give me a call? Or can we please talk on the phone sometime? So I can be nice to hear your voice. It'd be nice to apologize to you over the phone, you know, for this, and I, you know, etc. And here's an idea for you. But here is the— oh wait, but here's the point that I'm— this is just a little example I was using. But the reason I brought this up is in the formal meditation, I should just be meditating. But when I decide, okay, I'm going to think about now my father and apologizing to him outside of the formal meditation, I'm just going to sit in a chair in front of my computer, I'm just going to think about this for 10 minutes. And that's when I'll actually think about that. But when I'm out there in the yard, sitting under the tree, don't just do the love every moment thing, you know.

**Speaker A:** Well, let's go one step further, and that is sitting in a chair and thinking about apologizing to your dad is still not doing it. What you actually need to do is to write an email of apology to him and don't send it, but go ahead and write it down. Once you've got it written down, walk away from it and don't spend any more time about it. Have that as one of those kind of thoughts that you put on a note-do list. So you don't do New York and you don't do Dad. Once you get the email written, okay, and then the next day you go back and you sit down and you reread the email and you may want to edit it. So you edit it again. And then you don't send it. So you take it and keep it out of your mind so that now all day long on the second day, no thoughts of emails, no thoughts of Dad, and no thoughts from New York. Sure, let's stay on the island. Let's be here.

**Speaker B:** So it's not about actually thinking, it's about actually doing it. So when you have something that you would normally think about, don't think about it.

**Speaker A:** Just don't think about it.

**Speaker B:** Go do it right now. And when you do that thing, you can then think about it while you're doing it at the same time, which is just doing it basically because you're doing it.

**Speaker A:** Not only that, but if you're doing it correctly, you feel great doing it, which was the next thing. If you start into that email and you start feeling bad about it, then stop and walk away and get it out of the mind. Get New York out of the mind, get Dad out of the mind, get emails out of the mind, and get yourself back into a really pleasant state. Be on the island, be here now. Get yourself, you know, go take a dog walk and whatever and come back later and then put the mind on the email when you're in a really good state.

**Speaker B:** Sure, sure. So, okay, that's all great. Thank you for that.

**Speaker A:** So Well, this is the normal teaching. Do what you're going to do with all your mind, heart, and soul, and do it right, and feel good about what it's doing. And when you're finished with it, be finished.

**Speaker B:** Sure, sure,

**Speaker A:** sure. That's the point, that most people, when they're doing something, they want to be doing something else. That's why they call what they're doing now work. But then they go do something else and they don't want to do it. They want to stop doing this, and this is now work. Let me go do something else. And they're never satisfied. And in our practice, we don't do what we're doing and become satisfied while we're doing. We get away from it all first and work 100% completely in seclusion to get the mind into a state that we can do anything. Sure, we can do anything. We can do that email, it's a piece of cake. And then we sit down and rewrite the email, but we don't mail it, we keep it for review. Eventually it'll be— you'll feel good enough that now's the time to push the send button. Haha, I got it. All right, so this is a whole different way of looking at things. This is the way— this is why the Buddhist teaching is so radical, is the seclusion comes first, after the seclusion comes the joy, after the joy comes the attitude, and after the attitude comes the action. And yet in the way of the world, act first, learn later. Shoot first, ask questions later.

**Speaker B:** So seclusion, attitude, action— that's the way.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, seclusion, attitude, and then action. Once you get the attitude up, now we can do— this is what Metta is really all about. Metta is dealing with other people when you've got the best attitude. But you didn't get that attitude by messing with all those people. You got the right attitude by developing it in seclusion.

**Speaker B:** Sure. And so, yeah, comment on that. So one thing that's been really interesting about yesterday and also today is, is I noticed after all my time sitting, After last night, I sat for 2 hours last night, and today I just felt such a single-pointedness of mind carried throughout the entire day. And I sat another 2 hours and talking to you, you know, it's carrying through. It's just great. You know, just like when you do this, it just like carries through. It's like, you know, remember I talked

**Speaker A:** to you— You remember it more often. You're paying attention. That's the whole point. I wouldn't say that it carries through. I would say that the skill is there in yet this moment too. And then the skill is there, and yet this moment too, we're developing the skill, and here it is, right?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Nothing is continuing though,

**Speaker B:** right? Right. And you know, I remember in one of your talks, or it might have been in one of our conversations, I remember you saying like eventually you just learn to do this and you just do it all the time. You know, and you just are constantly doing this all the time, you know, just watching your mind, watching, watching, watching, correcting, doing the right thing again, you know, throwing out the hindrances again and again and again and again. It just becomes who you are. And I was thinking, you know what it's like? It's like learning how to read, you know, like when you're a child, you don't know how to read, you know, and then you figure it out, you know, through a very long and complicated process. And then suddenly you're reading everything. As an adult, you're reading all the time. I'm reading right now in the corner of the screen, it says Dhammarato Happy Skyper. You know, I can't tell you how I learned how to do that, but I just do it, you know.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, actually, uh, that's the— that's the skill that most, uh, primary school teachers are good at, but they're not good at keeping the children happy while the children are learning how to do that. Now, the next point is, is that they're only taught how to read words on paper, and they're not taught how to read reality, which is even deeper, more profound, and difficult school to learn, is when all the text is written in an alphabet that's natural. And believe me, in the natural world, there are a whole lot more letters than 26. And it seems that the more letters that an alphabet has, the more complicated that learning to read is. An example of that is that Thai has more than 40 characters. It's way up there, and it's got a lot of other little marks. And because of that, it's really difficult to learn to read Thai, but it can be done. Chinese, on the other hand, 10,000 characters, and that's just start.

**Speaker B:** Right. Yeah, it's something else, Chinese.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so the number of characters— well, you think Chinese is hard? Think about the language of reality.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you know, it's— there are no characters.

**Speaker A:** Well, there are, but we have to learn to recognize them without a teacher. We have to do that naturally on the inside. Which is basically noble right view. So long as we hold wrong views, which has to do with the child, or if we hold ordinary right views, which is the preview of the parent, the authority, the one who sets the rules, so long as we're in either one of those camps, there is not much of a horizon. Or that people can't see very far, can't see beyond the rules, they can't see beyond themselves. Well, with Noble Right View, that vista to reality can be completely opened up so that you can literally be here now, because that's where we find reality, is in the here now. The only reality we can experience is the reality that's happening right here, right now. We cannot experience the reality that's happening in New York, therefore that reality does not exist.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And by trying to make it exist, all we're doing is having a mental concept going on, which is not real. So being in reality is what we're practicing, to be in it and then to remember to be in it again. And maybe a flitter to New York, and then we forget that and remember to come back and be here now. This is the practice, and that is quite valuable to develop that kind of Sati. And so one of the ways of developing that kind of Sati again is by using the breath. Why? Because— and the Buddha talks about it— Sati on the in-breath, to remember to take a long deep in-breath, and then to remember to take a long deep out-breath. If we can do that, we're in the here and now twice every breath,

**Speaker B:** right?

**Speaker A:** Available for all of the other senses and not get caught back up into over there, over yonder, which is all happening in the mental sense. And so basically what the Buddhist practice is, is by being in real sensory awareness, we're in reality. And when we're in concepts and ideas, we're in a constructed reality.

**Speaker B:** Sure. I have a quick question about the Sati and the breaths. I just got to ask it so I don't— we don't lose track. So I notice that oftentimes the Sati will disrupt for a split moment when I reach the end of the in-breath or the end of the out-breath. So before the breath turns into an in-breath or turns into an out-breath, it's like the Sati wants to disrupt a little bit, and then I have to nurture it and just be like, no, just keep going. Here. But I wondered if you had any thoughts about that. I've been meaning to ask you about that for a while.

**Speaker A:** Yes. In fact, the right way normally, it depends upon the criteria. And in the criteria with Anapanasati, then we're going to have a longer gap between the last end of the out-breath before the next in-breath. As you said, that's the point in time when the mind can easily wander away, which means now that's the point in time we're going to be especially on vigil, is to keep the mind occupied correctly And we can do that in the sense of after the sign, we let it out. We can have that thought of, wow, this is so nice, or finally I'm at rest, or this is at home, or something that feels really relaxing. And those are the thoughts that you want to have during that out-breath. In the beginning. Later, as we work with the breath and the thoughts, we'll have it so that as we breathe out, the mind will stop and it won't start back up again until the next in-breath. And this is a way to practice so that the mind actually stops. This is the place where we begin to put the gaps between the wholesome thoughts. But in the beginning, we have to make sure that the wholesome thoughts are there, even in that gap between the out-breath and the in-breath. So if we're working at a fairly rapid rate of breathing, which would be, well, let us say 4-4-2. 4-4-2 is 10, which means 1-6. So we're talking about 6 breaths a minute, or about 10 seconds for a breath. We would have 4 on the in-breath and then 4 on the out-breath. And then for a count of 2, we're going to make sure that those 2 counts are completely wholesome. And then we take in the in-breath, going back to the Sati, paying attention to the breath. As you're breathing in with thoughts like, oh, isn't this so nice? And then on that out-breath, it's letting it out, letting everything go. It's almost like using the out-breath to clean house. Ah, a sigh of letting go, a wholesome thought.

**Speaker B:** Ah,

**Speaker A:** and then we breathe in again. So this is a way of practicing. And the kind of thoughts that we have is, wow, this is so nice, everything is okay, everything is fine. And then we can have those kind of thoughts also of, wow, how nice is it? Oh wow, there's no place to go. Oh wow, this idea is that It's the end of all problems. No more problems.

**Speaker B:** So ideas are unwholesome, correct?

**Speaker A:** The ideas keep us agitated often. Or another is that the idea is the result of the agitation, or is part of the agitation. But when we see it as a thought that's the solution to the problem, that's when we grab it.

**Speaker B:** So then here's another thing that I sometimes get carried away with in meditation is sometimes I'll start fantasizing about something and I'll just think about how great that thing is. You know, like it might be like, you know, oh, it'd be so great if this girl were my girlfriend, or, you know, it'd be so great if I had, you know, this job or this whatever, you know, or this amount of money, you know, or something like that. You know, and then I'll just like fixate on how great that would be for a while. And I don't do that that often, but sometimes it does come up, especially with like a girl that I fancy, you know. So yeah, there is

**Speaker A:** a certain amount of gratification to molesting the mind over things that we don't have. Wanting things that we don't have. Wouldn't it be nice if I had this, that, and the other thing? This is very, very common, but it's also dangerous. And so when you're having those kind of thoughts and you're having that kind of joy that comes with those kind of thoughts, start asking yourself also, or start looking for and start investigating, what's the danger in that stuff? Reminiscing about and longing for the things that you don't have.

**Speaker B:** Sure, and I have started doing that.

**Speaker A:** Because for one thing, it keeps you from being satisfied with what you do have right now.

**Speaker B:** It does.

**Speaker A:** And guess what? What you have right now is reality. And those pleasant thoughts about the things that you don't have it's not real.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** And it does create a certain amount of longing. You'll get even more satisfaction out of, hey, I don't want any of that stuff, I'm perfectly content right now.

**Speaker B:** Right. Yeah, it does create like dissonance, you know, and it creates longing. You know, it can be fine like if you just acknowledge and you're upfront with yourself that this is just a fantasy and like, well, just enjoy this for the moment.

**Speaker A:** Now that you see the benefit, now that you see the gratification, now that you see the part of having those kinds of thoughts that is pleasant, when you begin to look deeper, you will see that they have barbs, that there are dangers therein. And when you see that danger, you'll say, wait a minute, I can have more wholesome thoughts than this.

**Speaker B:** Right, right.

**Speaker A:** And then you begin to start moving that bar, as we've talked about, by inspecting these thoughts and recognizing, yes, I do see the benefit in those thoughts, but I can also see the dangers in those thoughts. Let me work in a way to where I'm having thoughts that have even more benefit and even less danger.

**Speaker B:** Right, which is the same story as with the ideas. Where you can see the benefits, but you also see the danger of focusing on the problems as opposed to right now.

**Speaker A:** When in fact, the benefit of having those ideas is, well, let's have a really good idea and get the benefit about that. And that is that ideas are not worthwhile because there's no problems to solve, right? Why should I think about the solution to a particular problem when it's not my problem?

**Speaker B:** Right, or let's have a really great fantasy, which is that I don't need any of those fantasies because the present moment is so perfect already.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Now, as you can imagine, I kind of learned that in the 1970s, in the days of the engineering. I mean, engineers engineer things, right? Okay. And so Engineers that engineer a bunch of stuff have a whole lot more ideas than they can actually put into practice.

**Speaker B:** Right. I have that problem too. I have so many.

**Speaker A:** 10,000, 10,000 excellent ideas. One or two of them may or may not get implemented.

**Speaker B:** That's a huge problem for me. I have so many ideas that I end up never doing anything. You know, okay, it's very frustrating. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Aha! Now you see the dangers in having all of those ideas. They're frustrating because we don't put them into practice, right?

**Speaker B:** Right, because you can't. There's just not enough time. And so then you have to select,

**Speaker A:** and it doesn't belong to you anyway. You're having solutions to problems that don't belong to you.

**Speaker B:** Right, right.

**Speaker A:** I did that one time when I dreamt up a database. Oh, it was so marvelous, but it never got implemented. I don't remember what it was, but it was some fine thing then. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** No, I mean, I have ideas, like I have ideas about small things to big things, you know, whether it's like, oh, be nice to read this book, you know, or to listen to this sometime. That's a small idea, right? Just something for me to do, or like, oh, start this business, you know, or write this book. I have like 50 ideas for books I could write, you know. I have many ideas, you know, scattered around my phone, you know.

**Speaker A:** You know, so here's an idea for you, you know. Here's an idea for you. Yeah, here's an idea for you. You don't have to write a book.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** You don't have to write any books.

**Speaker B:** No, no, I don't.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, guess what? Most people don't, and they're miserable because they didn't write a book. Guess what? You can be really, really happy because all of those books that you were told that you had to write, both by you and others, you don't have to write it. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** I mean, it's like you've said many times, there's already enough books, you know. There's like more than— you don't have to write it. There's way too many, actually. There's Not only is there enough, there's just too many. You know, no one can ever read them all, and so many of them are trash. You know, like, there's a lot of bad books out there. You know, and

**Speaker A:** you know who makes the wrong— you know who writes bad books?

**Speaker B:** Who?

**Speaker A:** Every author's first one.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I've heard something like that before. I've also heard the first draft is always a garbage draft, you know. That's very common, you know. It's funny though, that was one of my skills at university, is I could write a good first draft, you know, and I could do it in a short amount of time.

**Speaker A:** You've got a new skill.

**Speaker B:** What?

**Speaker A:** You don't have to.

**Speaker B:** I don't have to.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you don't have to. Now that's a better skill.

**Speaker B:** It is, it is. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** That you don't have to write a book. Isn't that marvelous? It is. You'd be surprised at how many times I've heard, you ought to write a book. And my answer's always been, there's already enough books.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, you're right, there's a lot. And you're already contributing a lot with your YouTube channel, you know, like that's more than enough, you know. It's very unique. It's a very unique YouTube channel. I don't know of any others like it. You know, it's great. So I think that's worth more than all those books out there that are rather similar to each other. You know.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so we can look at that then. This is, in fact, we can title this video A Good Idea.

**Speaker B:** Okay, cool. It's a nice title. I like it.

**Speaker A:** A good idea is that we don't have to have good ideas. We can be happy without good ideas. The good ideas don't make us happy.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** So we've looked at two sides of it. One is that we have an idea and we apply it and it didn't work. But then we looked at the fact that we've got whole bunches of ideas that never get applied. And so we don't even know whether they work or not. But every time we have that good idea, I had a good idea. Oh, Anagami marvelous or what?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I know. And you end up collecting all this pointless stuff too. Like, I have all these books that I'll never get to read, you know, because I'll just think, oh, that'd be great to read that someday, and I'll go buy it, you know.

**Speaker A:** You know, and now you can look at that book and say, guess what, I don't have to ever read that. I don't have to read it. I don't have to.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, you know, have you ever heard of Umberto Eco's Anti-Library?

**Speaker A:** No.

**Speaker B:** So he had Umberto Eco, you know, he died a few years ago, he's a famous philosopher. He had what he called an anti-library, which was a library in his house of books that he had never read. And it was specifically for books that he had never read. And when they were read, he would move it from the anti-library to the library.

**Speaker A:** Well, he's got everything backwards. Because once you've read a book, you'll never read it again. Or you shouldn't. And if you do read it and read it and read it, then it doesn't belong in the library, it belongs on your bedstand or on your bed. But basically, all the libraries of the world are filled with books that nobody reads.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I know, it's a shame.

**Speaker A:** And so a library is in fact the books that nobody reads. Once a book is read, it comes out of the library, and now it's a good book if you keep reading it. If you stop reading it, then it can go back into the library. Library is the place where you kept unread books.

**Speaker B:** Well, it's funny because you could almost say the reason we have libraries is to be like a homage to the people who had enough chutzpah to go write their own book, because the vast majority of those books are not going to be read.

**Speaker A:** Oh gosh, and I thought we put all those books in the library because we didn't want them in the landfill. Pollutes our landfill with all them books.

**Speaker B:** Well, that's one way of looking at it. And actually, this is another topic. Related is I've found I often will find like a very positive way of looking at something, you know, and I don't know if that is always like the right way to look at, like for example, what I just said, it's like a library is a homage, you know, to all the people that have the courage to write a book, you know, even though many of those books will never get read. That's a very wholesome, happy point of view. But yeah, I don't think it's really right per se, you know, but it's like a wholesome view. So what are your thoughts on kind of having wholesome, happy views of things that aren't necessarily accurate?

**Speaker A:** A little bit further investigation and you can have wholesome, happy thoughts that are accurate, that they're not mutually exclusive, you know.

**Speaker B:** Right. And I think one other thing I'm thinking about in my own life is like, for example, I might— let's say I'm spending too much money, right? And, and my dad might criticize me for that. Oh, you're spending too much money, you know, yada yada yada. And then I will have the lion's attitude of, you know what, I can spend this money now because I know I'll be able to to survive no matter what. Like, it doesn't matter whatever happens. If I have to live more humbly later, you know, that's fine because I just need to do this right now and I don't really care, you know. And so it's this very positive attitude of nothing can stop me, I'll be fine, you know. But it is maybe wiser to think the way my father is of, oh, I should reduce my spending. You know, for future sustainability, for whatever reasons. I have more savings, etc.

**Speaker A:** So I was about to mention that exactly, and also, uh, caution you what we've talked about before, that in fact if your dad says don't spend so much money, you're automatically going to rebel against that, right? I mean, you're quite the rebel, just like he is.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so he's rebelling against society and telling you don't spend money, and here you are rebelling against his good advice. To where the Buddha would talk about it in the sense of the Four Requisites. Now, the Four Requisites, there's quite a lot about them in Sutra Number 2 in the Saba Asava Sutta, under the label of tanks that are to be destroyed by using. As opposed to taints that are to be destroyed by avoiding. Some things you avoid and some things you don't avoid. OK, for instance, it's a whole lot easier for someone to quit smoking or to quit drinking because they don't need that at all. But it's very difficult for someone to go on a diet because they can't Quit eating. Sure, right. Okay, so now that we've established— pardon,

**Speaker B:** unless they're a Jain.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's got nothing to do with it. I don't know where that's going. But anyway, uh, the 4 requisites is adequate housing, adequate clothing, adequate food, and adequate medical attention. Now, it's quite possible for people to live, but it's not good living if they have to do without one or the other of them. For instance, children go to bed hungry, others go to bed on the street because they've got no housing. But the Buddha would recommend that we have to have at least adequate housing, which would be a hut in the woods, adequate food, but that's all that we need, and that we're looking at it in the sense of the let us say, the more powerful and refined the mind is, the more unified the mind is, and the more confidence one has, then that means that our bottom line will go down, so that what used to be adequate now becomes luxurious, and we can come down to a level of adequacy. Okay, this is a way of practice of in the sense of how frugal can you get? Well, it's funny, Charlie, can you be—

**Speaker B:** well, society will say the opposite, which is the more confident you are, the higher your standard will be because you'll think you're the king and so you deserve the highest.

**Speaker A:** I thought that we had discussed society's problems already. Yes, in fact, that is the lie. They want you to consume everything that you've produced so that you will produce more, because they get a cut.

**Speaker B:** Right, right.

**Speaker A:** OK, who gets a cut? Often the religions get a cut, often the government gets a cut, business gets a cut, everybody gets a cut of the laborer's labor. That in fact, everybody gets so much of a cut that the laborer is kind of left without. So if he's, if he's worth $50 an hour, he may get paid $15, and all these other people take their cut. That's why they keep wanting him to work. That's why they want him to spend his money.

**Speaker B:** Sure. So they want it. So to go back to the earlier point about if your mind is really refined, your, your level, your standard you'll accept goes down as opposed to up. So, so I would imagine the reason for that would be is you feel you can handle anything, so you might as well be economical because there's no reason to be extravagant. It's just not logical to

**Speaker A:** be extravagant. If you don't need it, don't buy it.

**Speaker B:** Right. Right. Which is honestly like one of the worst things about living in New York is like you just feel like this need to buy things all the time. So many people that live there have that. I have a friend who visits sometimes. I think I've told you this before. He said like every time he visits, he feels like a vacuum cleaner gets attached to his wallet. That city just really makes you wanna spend money. I've never experienced anything like it.

**Speaker A:** It's— [Speaker:Dhammarato] There's a slight mistake in there. That vacuum cleaner is not attached to his wallet, it's attached to his mind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And I'm not sure that there's a vacuum. I think then what it's doing is force-feeding greed into the mind.

**Speaker B:** Right, right, right. And yeah, so, you know, I'm curious about this, this mystery of nature and why it seems to be the case that when I'm in nature, I will just spontaneously, you know, have solutions to problems. Do you have any thoughts on that?

**Speaker A:** You know, for one thing, the solutions were already there. But when you make room for them in the mind, they will kind of pop up, right? Scientists know about this for a long time, known about it, that if you've got a particular problem on your mind, you're not going to solve it. But if you get away from it, the solution, which was clear and obvious— so obvious that it was like, dang, why couldn't I have thought about that yesterday?— the answer is because you were searching for it. And like a mouse is going to hide from the cat, right?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** The best way for a cat to catch a mouse is just to sit still and watch, and when the mouse comes out, you pounce.

**Speaker B:** Well, yeah, this is one of the amazing things about being out here, is I just feel so much more clear-headed, you know, it's like a really big difference.

**Speaker A:** Well, we can go back to the fact that much of the rumble of New York is not rumble of the tires and the friction of the pavement. The rumble is in fact a noise of the mind. And when you have a whole lot of minds collected together, each one of them shouting in rage, anger, frustration, etc., like that. It becomes kind of a cacophony of needs. And when you're away from all of those people, it begins to feel really easy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, totally.

**Speaker A:** So it's called a vibe. You can experience it. I don't know where it is in, uh, as far as in the electromagnetic spectrum. That I'm not sure about, but the human body picks that stuff up, just like your friend says that it feels like when he walks into New York that he's in the atmosphere that has the, um, uh, the idea of the sensation of having a vacuum cleaner attached to his wallet, right? But if he looks a little bit differently, it's actually a feeling of tension and anxiety that we have been trained that we can relieve that by spending money and buying something. We buy something to relieve us of the tensions of being in the city.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Right. Everybody's in a hurry. Everybody is anxious. Everybody is uptight. Everybody's looking for something.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And that, that those vibes They rub off to every country bumpkin.

**Speaker B:** Sure, sure. Yeah, no, it's— yeah, it's really something.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but you know it. I mean, now because you've experienced that, so now that you know the distinction, you have a choice. Are you going to return to New York knowing that it's got that vibe to it, or are you going to look for places that are more conducive to mental health?

**Speaker B:** Well, the way I'm feeling right now is I don't want to go back there at all.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, enjoy where you are then. Just enjoy it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and you know, that might change, but that's how I feel right now, you know, is I do not want

**Speaker A:** to go back there. And you might get your mind into such great, wonderful shape that you can take on the world. You can even handle New York. Yeah, I can take care of New York. Let me have it, you know. Okay, yeah, go get it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But be careful to keep that attitude because you may get there and find out that this place is a little bit bigger than you thought it was.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Talking about the Big Apple, you may take out more of a bite than you can chew.

**Speaker B:** Right, right. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** But certainly don't go back because you've got to or because you need to. Go back with the attitude that I can handle that apple.

**Speaker B:** Sure, sure. So I— so another— guess what?

**Speaker A:** I don't have that attitude about New York even now. I don't think I want to go bother.

**Speaker B:** Wow, good for you. Yeah, yeah, you know, kind of like

**Speaker A:** my peaceful paradise here.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's great. Um, so it— so another hindrance, you know, that's come up recently And I love just going through all of these with you. This is really good fun for me. Is a little bit of loneliness, you know, like especially for the company of women, you know, in particular. So that has been something that's come up, and I'm sure this is something a lot of monks deal with, you know. So I'd love to hear your thoughts on that, especially, you know, desire for women, you know, etc. Win in seclusion?

**Speaker A:** The first thing is to recognize that thoughts, certain kinds of thoughts, bring up that longing. And when you feel that longing, you can actually deal with it directly once you feel it. If you're really sharp, you can see the thoughts before it brings up the longing. Okay, but once the longing is there, with breathing and with wholesome thoughts, you can say, wow, right now I'm actually better off without one of those things. Sure, this very moment is good enough as it is without someone.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** And come back to this present moment. And recognize the longing was something that got started because of thoughts. Unwholesome thoughts brought up the longing. What are those thoughts? Thoughts of wanting something you don't have, right?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And so when those thoughts of wanting something you don't have, they're going to bring up longing. You're going to feel incomplete, unwhole. And when you catch that, you say, I don't have to feel that way.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** If I'm practicing correctly, if I'm practicing right, then I can just take a deep breath and never mind, everything's okay. I don't need that, right? You know, and we can say there may be another time at another place when I get my act together, we'll deal with it. But right now, I'm better off right here. This is the place to be. And so having those kind of wholesome thoughts— this is okay, everything is all right, everything is fine— we'll deal with those kind of things later once the skills are fully developed. And right now I'm developing those skills by being able to put these kind of thoughts out of the mind.

**Speaker B:** Sure, sure. And yeah, you know, and, and it's interesting because I do have a few girls that I'm, you know, in contact with and, you know, interested in But, but, you know, they're quite far away at the moment.

**Speaker A:** And well, I told what are the things that you might want to do then is either there's two ways to handle it. One is just to turn off the email and don't look at any emails or any incoming or any social medias or anything like that. And the other option, which is a little bit more chicken, is to tell them at your own retreat.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** But the right thing to do is just go do what you were going to do. Get away from it all. Don't look at them.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, just forget about it, you know. Yeah, if they text, I respond, but other than that, just let it, you know, let it, let it go. Yeah, but, um, yeah, no, it's hard though to do that.

**Speaker A:** Like, as I say that— no, it's not hard. It's only hard for a victim. And you're not a victim. You're the winner here. You're the one who owns those fingers that punch those keys to get up emails, right? You're the boss here. You can say, no, I don't want nothing to do with that kind of stuff right now. I'm going to have my retreat.

**Speaker B:** Sure, sure.

**Speaker A:** And so putting it— putting that stuff aside. Don't go there. Don't go to New York. Don't go to Dad. Stay away from all of that stuff. Recognize that those are unwholesome thoughts, and that the kind of wholesome thoughts you want to have is, wow, how nice it is right now without any of that. No place to go, no work to do. Now that one's a really nice one. I really like that one. When I recognize, gosh, I don't have any responsibilities, no one is making any demands upon me at all. Now if I go write that girlfriend an email, now I've got responsibility. She may write back, and then what am I going to do, right?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** But the reality is, is that she's not writing to me and I'm not writing to her, so I don't have to worry about it. Everything's okay. I got no problems. I got no place to go and nothing to do. No responsibilities. Isn't that so marvelous?

**Speaker B:** Sure, sure. Totally. Yeah, and that, that's actually the point about the writing people. I love to write people. I love to send texts and this and that.

**Speaker A:** Guess what? You can also love not writing people.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I, I should really pull back on that, you know, like, because it does bring me out of the moment to do it. And it's just something I just like to do, but I think I can just step back on that and just enjoy the moment more, for sure.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Let your seclusion be real seclusion for a while.

**Speaker B:** Right. 3 or 4 months. Yeah, yeah, that would be great. And here's another funny thing, is like another little internal contradiction. And I feel like I already even know the answer, just what you'll say, but just worth bringing up, why not, is I feel like financially and also to not burden my mom, it's a good idea to apply for jobs, but I really don't wanna do that. I really don't wanna do that. So just don't do it.

**Speaker A:** In what way are you burdening your mom other than groceries?

**Speaker B:** No other way. Just, just like, maybe the mental burden of me being here, you know. Um, I don't know if that's— she's

**Speaker A:** going to have that mental burden no matter where you are or what you're doing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's true.

**Speaker A:** But if she knows that you're well off and comfortable and happy, that will take a load off of her mind. And it doesn't mean that she sees that you're well employed, because well employed does not mean well off.

**Speaker B:** Sure.

**Speaker A:** And so being well off, being happy, being content is all your mom needs. That's the payback, is be successful at this.

**Speaker B:** Sure. All right. Yeah, well, yeah,

**Speaker A:** yeah. In fact, you could say that you owe it to her. I really felt that way, that I owed it to Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. He cared so much about me, and Arahant Po cared so much about me that I felt obligated. I've got to do this, right?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** So you could use your mom as part of that, that she's giving you the place to stay and everything is marvelous for that. Pay her back by getting good benefit out of your stay.

**Speaker B:** Sure, sure. So my mom did ask, so she asked me on Sunday, oh, have you started applying for jobs yet? And I said, Mom, I'm just kind of on vacation right now. And she was like, okay, how about tomorrow? And I said, okay, maybe I can do that. And so I applied for a few today, and it takes a while to hear back and all this. It's not something that, but Maybe I should go to her and say, you know, Mom, I think I'm just gonna, you know, go on retreat now for a little while.

**Speaker A:** You don't have to do any of that, okay? You don't have to do that. You just be on retreat and let her have what she's going to have. You just be on retreat.

**Speaker B:** So just say to her, like, if she asks, yeah, Mom, I'm applying Everything is all right.

**Speaker A:** Everything's fine. It's taken care of. Don't worry a thing, Mom. Everything's okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I know how she is though. She'll start asking questions like, oh, have you heard from anyone, or this or that, you know. And, um, you know, heard from any companies and get any interviews, you know. She'll start asking.

**Speaker A:** All she wants is reassurance, and all you have to do is give her reassurance. Everything's okay. Everything's fine. Yeah, it's going to work out just fine, Mom. Oh, you do not have to buy her worry. She's out there selling worry, isn't she? She's been selling you that kind of worry for many, many years.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so you can give her back some reassurance. Everything's okay, Mom, we'll take care of it. Get that done. You don't have to worry about a thing. Sure, we got everything that we need. Not lie to her. Don't lie to her, but reassure her everything's fine.

**Speaker B:** All right, I like it. Cool.

**Speaker A:** Because guess what? Everything really is fine.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** She hasn't figured that out yet. She thinks things won't be fine until you get a job, right?

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** And so she had to be reassured everything is fine, everything's okay, not a problem in the world.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, totally. So cool. So I'm thinking of Um, of, uh, you know, just setting my phone down, you know, and just, you know, not using it.

**Speaker A:** Literally just hanging out. Just go enjoy your life. Yeah, in the present moment and just find so much joy. Go play with the dog, go scratch the dog.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, I do that. We go for our long walks, you know, I listen to music and just have a great time, you know, and It's great teaching.

**Speaker A:** Stay out of New York. Stay out of New York.

**Speaker B:** Right, right, right. And yeah, you know, I might have to go into Seattle for just a few days in August, but it's just a few days, you know, it's not the end of the world. But it's in several weeks, so it won't matter.

**Speaker A:** We'll talk later about that. Never mind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** We'll go ahead and finish off now, and we'll talk to you later.

**Speaker B:** All right, that sounds good. And thank you very much. It's been a great one. It's been one of my favorites in a while. So we covered a lot of ground. So thank you very much.

**Speaker A:** We did not go anywhere. That's the whole point. We covered absolutely no ground. We didn't go anyplace.

**Speaker B:** True that. True that. That's the Buddha's truth right there.

**Speaker A:** Okay, see you later.

**Speaker B:** See you later.

**Speaker A:** Bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a Sangha friend (Speaker B), revolves around the core theme of **"being here now"** and the radical shift in perspective required for true meditation and peace. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Teaching: Be Here Now**
*   The primary instruction is to fully inhabit your present reality. If you are on an island, have thoughts about the island. Thinking about New York, past conflicts, or future plans means you are not present.
*   Speaker B's anecdote about a couple marveling at a piece of wood on the beach illustrates this perfectly: their reality was completely contained in that present-moment experience, free from the complex mental narratives of "New York life."

### **The Danger of "Planning Ahead" vs. "Being Prepared"**
*   Society encourages "planning ahead," which is risky because it creates attachment to a specific future. If things don't go to plan, you suffer.
*   The wiser approach is **"being prepared,"** which means cultivating a mind that is ready and adaptable for anything. This is done through seclusion and mental training, not through endless strategizing.

### **Problems are Ideas; Joy is Independent**
*   A significant portion of the talk deconstructs our relationship with thoughts and problem-solving.
*   **Key Insight:** A "problem" is just an idea. The "solution" is another idea. The feeling of relief or the "aha!" moment when you think you've solved something is a feeling you can generate *without* the intermediary of a problem.
*   Dhammarato advises: Instead of waiting for a "good idea" to make you happy, have the "grand idea" that **there are no problems to solve.** True joy comes from recognizing you don't need ideas to be content. Clinging to problem-solving and ideas leads to agitation and disappointment.

### **The Correct Order: Seclusion → Attitude → Action**
*   The worldly way is "act first, learn later" (shoot first, ask questions later). This leads to stress and poor decisions.
*   The Buddhist path is the reverse:
    1.  **Seclusion:** First, withdraw to calm and unify the mind.
    2.  **Attitude (Joy/Metta):** From seclusion, cultivate a joyful, loving, and confident mind.
    3.  **Action:** From that solid foundation, take action. Action becomes clear, effective, and done with a good feeling.
*   Applied to Speaker B's example of writing an apology to his father: Don't just think about it anxiously. First, get into a joyful state (seclusion/attitude). Then, write the email in one focused session (action). Review it later from the same good state. This prevents the task from poisoning your present moment.

### **Practical Meditation & Hindrances**
*   **Anchoring in the Present:** The breath is the perfect tool because it anchors you in the "here and now" twice with each cycle. The specific moment at the turn between breaths is where the mind most easily wanders, so it requires special vigilance filled with wholesome thoughts like "everything is okay."
*   **Dealing with Hindrances:** Common hindrances like longing for a partner, fantasizing about the future, or feeling lonely are addressed by seeing their danger:
    *   They pull you out of the present, creating a sense of lack.
    *   Recognize the thought that sparks the longing, and replace it with the wholesome thought: "Right now, I am better off without that. Everything is fine as it is."
*   **Nature's Clarity:** The clarity and spontaneous solutions found in nature come because the mind is released from its habitual "searching" mode. Solutions emerge when you stop aggressively looking for them.

### **Radical Re-framing of Life's Pressures**
*   The talk applies the "here and now" principle to life pressures:
    *   **Career/Job Search:** Don't act from anxiety. Reassure others from a place of genuine calm ("Everything is fine"). True success is being happy and content, not just employed.
    *   **Financial Pressure:** Society promotes consumption to fuel anxiety. A refined mind finds its "bottom line" lowering; it needs less because it finds sufficiency in the present moment.
    *   **Social Obligations:** It's okay to truly seclude yourself. You don't have to write that book, answer that text, or manage someone else's worry. Protect your retreat to build the mental strength that will eventually allow you to engage skillfully.

### **Conclusion**
The entire conversation is a practical guide to disentangling from the conceptual, future-oriented, and problem-focused mind that society cultivates. The path to peace is to **continuously return to the sensory reality of the present moment**, cultivate joy independently of circumstances, and let wise action flow from that settled and joyful state. As Dhammarato quips at the end, the entire fruitful talk "covered absolutely no ground"—because the goal is to stop mentally traveling and to simply *be here*.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used in the talk:

### **Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **"Being on the Island" / "Being Here Now"**
    *   **What it is:** A central, extended metaphor for mindfulness and seclusion. The physical island represents a mental state of being present, free from distractions about other places (New York), times (past/future), or people.
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate the practice of letting go of mental projections and abiding in present-moment reality.

2.  **The "Sign that says 'Plan Ahead'"**
    *   **What it is:** A humorous, concrete example of a common societal message. The speaker critiques it, saying the real problem was not planning ahead for the lettering, but not paying attention ("Watch what you're doing") in the moment.
    *   **Purpose:** To distinguish between anxious, future-oriented "planning" (which is dangerous) and present-moment awareness that naturally leads to being "prepared."

3.  **"Learning to Read"**
    *   **What it is:** An analogy for the development of mindfulness. Just as a child laboriously learns to decode letters and then reads effortlessly as an adult, one can train the mind to "read" the present moment until it becomes a constant, effortless skill.
    *   **Purpose:** To explain how meditation practice becomes a natural, integrated part of one's being.

4.  **"The Alphabet of Reality"**
    *   **What it is:** An extension of the reading metaphor. The speaker compares learning Thai (40+ characters) or Chinese (thousands of characters) to the vastly more complex task of learning to "read" the subtle language of direct reality and Noble Right View.
    *   **Purpose:** To emphasize the depth and subtlety of insight practice compared to conventional learning.

5.  **"The Cat and the Mouse"**
    *   **What it is:** A metaphor for problem-solving. The frantic search for a solution (the cat chasing the mouse) is less effective than calming the mind and allowing the solution to emerge naturally (the cat sitting still, waiting for the mouse to appear).
    *   **Purpose:** To explain why solutions often arise spontaneously in nature or during meditation—because the mind has stopped aggressively searching and become still.

6.  **"New York as a Vacuum Cleaner on the Wallet/Mind"**
    *   **What it is:** A friend's metaphor, which Speaker A refines. The city doesn't just suck money; it attaches to the *mind*, "force-feeding greed" and creating anxiety that one tries to relieve by spending.
    *   **Purpose:** To describe the oppressive, consumerist "vibe" or atmosphere of a place that is antithetical to the peaceful "island" state of mind.

7.  **"Taking too big a bite of the Big Apple"**
    *   **What it is:** A playful pun on New York's nickname. It warns against overconfidence, thinking one can easily handle the city's stressful environment after a retreat.
    *   **Purpose:** To caution that a hard-won peaceful attitude can be fragile and easily overwhelmed by a powerful, unwholesome environment.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Couple and the Piece of Wood**
    *   **What it is:** Speaker B's story about seeing a couple on the beach completely engrossed in examining a piece of driftwood. He contrasts their simple, present-moment fascination with his own New York mindset of constant mental complication about people and tasks.
    *   **Purpose:** To provide a real-life example of "being here now" and the simplicity of mind it brings, contrasted with the complex, future-oriented thinking of conventional life.

2.  **The Unwritten Apology Email to Dad**
    *   **What it is:** Speaker B's ongoing story about needing to apologize to his father. It becomes a practical example of how to handle tasks without letting them dominate the mind. Speaker A advises to write the email in a focused session, then set it aside—"get Dad out of the mind"—and return to being on the "island."
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate the practical application of the teaching: *do* a task with full attention when you choose to, then be fully finished with it mentally, rather than letting it become a source of persistent, distracting thought.

3.  **The Engineer's 10,000 Unimplemented Ideas**
    *   **What it is:** Speaker A's story from his past about engineers (and himself) who generate countless brilliant ideas that never get built. Speaker B relates to this with his own multitude of book and business ideas.
    *   **Purpose:** To demonstrate the "danger" (frustration, wasted mental energy) of clinging to ideas and fantasies, and to pivot to the "good idea" of realizing **you don't need to execute any of them** to be happy.

4.  **Umberto Eco's Anti-Library**
    *   **What it is:** Speaker B references the philosopher's library of *unread* books, which was separate from his library of read books.
    *   **Purpose:** To spark a discussion on accumulation (of books, ideas). Speaker A flips it, stating that libraries are essentially collections of *unread* books, highlighting the irony of accumulating things (physical or mental) we never actually use or need.

### **Core Conceptual Metaphors**
*   **Seclusion → Joy → Attitude → Action:** This is presented as the correct, radical Buddhist sequence, contrasted with the worldly way of "Act first, learn later" or "Shoot first, ask questions later."
*   **The "Aha" moment:** The talk reframes the "aha" of solving a problem. It argues that the real, reliable "aha" should be the realization that **you can feel joy directly, without needing a "solution" as the trigger.** The best idea is "I have no problems."

**Overall Theme:** The metaphors and stories consistently contrast two worlds: the complex, future-anxious, idea-clinging world of society (New York) with the simple, present-focused, contented world of mindful seclusion (the Island). The tools for moving from the former to the latter are seclusion, present-moment awareness (like watching the breath), and cultivating joy independent of external conditions.
