### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, welcome all to the Open Sangha Foundation meeting. The primary agenda for this meeting was to vote in the bylaws and conflict of interest policy. Since there aren't many of us here today, we thought— Tyler had the suggestion that we walk through and talk about the bylaws, and then we can vote them in asynchronously through text chat. And it would just be good to talk them over and that anyway, that's the main thing. Other things might be Tyler and I did some work on a Discord server, and we're going to start inviting people who are working on like the website or specific project over to try and test it out. And those are the two specific things on the agenda. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Does each person that's going to be on the Discord group have to make friends with each individual person, or is there a way that Um, because that's how Tyler and I were able to connect. It was that I had to specifically request him for a friend, or vice versa.

**Speaker C:** Um, no, you don't need to do that to be part of the Discord group. Like, anybody can join as long as they have the link to join. Uh, we were doing is that you have to be friends to like message each other and like start a video call. And so that's what we were doing, we added each other as friends.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so people will be able to have a video call even though they haven't had that in-way connection?

**Speaker C:** That's right, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Where in is a factorial.

**Speaker C:** Okay, sweet. Um, Parker, do you want to start on the.

**Speaker B:** Uh, bylaw?

**Speaker A:** Um, yeah, uh, So Tyler and I both went over it. You might be a little more recently familiar with it. Do you feel comfortable walking through it, Tyler? If not, I can.

**Speaker C:** Sure, yeah, I can like just call out a couple things that are important to call out, basically, and things that we kind of maybe want feedback on. In the next couple days, but we'll leave it to make sure the rest of the board members affirmatively say like, yes, this looks like their obligations under this before we submit it. The reason why this matters is because the bylaws we create, they end up being like, actually they have legal ramifications. We are actually bound to them. And cases where this would matter is that if the foundation, we were sued for some reason, and we weren't shown to be following our own bylaws, that can open Sangha Foundation to liability, but also board members to personal liability potentially. And so it's important that we, like, the bylaws we're passing, we're actually committing to. And the bylaws that we've set up are really kind of like the minimum viable bylaws. We're not, they're not bylaws, we're not adding anything extra in there. They're the things that kind of traditionally the IRS needs to like approve you as being tax exempt. And so I'm just gonna call out like a couple of them, and Parker, feel free to like jump in if I'm missing anything or if you wanna have any additional color. So one of the bylaws, we'll talk about, we'll first talk about like board member eligibility and a couple things about like what it means to be a board member and how you become a board member. So board member eligibility, there's a really important piece in the bylaws about conflicts of interest. And so basically, if like any of us had a side business or something that we were— Open Sangha Foundation that was procuring services from, that would be like a big conflict of interest. And that'd be something that we need to disclose and talk about before we would spend any funds, right? So that's like a really critical piece that is very important that we take that super, super seriously. That like, if you have, like, let's say for example, I had like a website building business and we hired this website building business. We would have to have a serious discussion about that, and we probably wouldn't want to do that because we'd get some trouble from the IRS from that especially. We'll talk next about kind of like board member roles and responsibilities. So for board— Tyler, I'm going to.

**Speaker A:** Make a quick point there as to the conflict of interest as well. That this might be something that we consider with retreats and whatever scholarship, if we decide to go down that road in the future, which I imagine we will, with people on the board of directors or being teachers at retreats that might fall under that same contract conflict of interest. And just another point, Tyler, your mic is a little— or your mic and video is a little laggy.

**Speaker C:** Oh, sorry. Yeah, I'm hotspotting right now. I could take my video off. That would be better. Yeah, that might be better. Okay. Yeah, I'll try.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, your video is freezing and there's blockage in your audio. So it would be good if you could cut your video off. That would probably make the audio better.

**Speaker C:** Okay, great. Let me know if the audio ever cuts out. So, all right, so a couple other things. So, again, good point about the conflict of interest thing with the retreat centers. Hopefully we're doing everything purely Dharma-based, so hopefully we never have to confront that issue. So we'll talk about board member roles and responsibilities. The primary responsibility we have as a board— so I guess maybe we could start, you know, even further is like the purpose of the board. So with nonprofits or 501(c)(3)s, the board is really intended to oversee the entire organization. Like we're like the last line, we're like the top of the line, all comes in through the board. So this is anything, any like financial questions, legal questions, everything major goes through the board and needs to be passed through the board. And so we might have an executive director, or will likely appoint an executive director. They'll have a lot of latitude for operational decisions, but at the end of the day, the board is who decides what we do and what we can and cannot do. And this is like a legal requirement to have this tax-exempt status of being on a— hey, Robert— of being a 501(c)(3). So a couple of things we have to do as a board, a couple of like bare minimum requirements. One is we have to have an annual meeting, and so this is going to be— we'll probably do at the beginning of every year where we come go through our finances. We talk about the direction of nonprofit, whether we have any legal obligations, and if we're employing anybody, what compensation looks like, any outstanding board proposals. And so we're going to do this at least once every year. More likely we're going to do it— we're legally required to do it once every year. Based on our bylaws, we'll probably do it more often, like maybe once a quarter. And then during that meeting, we need to take meeting minutes. And so I think Robert is the secretary, right? So this is something— important function of the secretary is taking those meeting minutes. That's what's going to allow us to keep the tax-exempt status, is that documentation. So the next piece I'll go into is about the board member roles. And so generally, like traditionally, there's at least 3 roles, like the vice— the president, the vice president, the— or sorry, chair, vice chair, secretary, and treasurer. And so with those roles, like these again are kind of like some like the minimum viable roles you need to get your nonprofit approved by the IRS. And so we kind of discussed that last call, so I'm not going to go too deep into that. So I guess like in short, I think— oh, then the last piece I'll cover is about how the board makes decisions. So the board basically makes decisions by having— we have a majority present to do a quorum, to have a quorum to even take a vote. And then from there we can do a majority vote for passing any resolution. So yeah, I'll kind of pause there. I think those are the main points of how our bylaws work and what you need to know and what we're legally accountable for. But we can like double-click on anything if anybody wants to discuss anything more.

**Speaker B:** No, I don't have anything. I've read the bylaws, and other than the issue of the quorum at being half, does that mean the entire board, or does it mean the officers?

**Speaker C:** Uh, that's just the board.

**Speaker B:** Board. The whole board.

**Speaker A:** People, uh, would be the minimum.

**Speaker B:** Okay, how many board members do we have completely? Because I was wanting to pack the board not knowing that that might be an issue. We've got 9 now. 10.

**Speaker A:** Okay, uh, me, Kishan, Tyler, Joe, Robert Candler, Eric, Corey, Robert Cohen and Kethal.

**Speaker C:** Okay, so just to clarify something on that, like, we really only need the board all fully present for.

**Speaker A:** Um, kind.

**Speaker C:** Of that annual meeting, or we might make it quarterly. And so what we're going to be doing, like, weekly or at the very least biweekly meetings where we talk about, like, more operational day-to-day stuff, and the board doesn't need to be there for all— there for that. It'd be awesome if we were because we should all be engaged and doing work on this, but, um this isn't going to like be a roadblock for us, I think. Okay, cool. Anybody else have anything they want to kind of mention that we didn't talk about, or any questions? So how about this? I think we— oh, sorry, Robert, go for it.

**Speaker D:** Oh yeah, sure. So regarding the minutes, is there a particular format by which I have to abide? And if so, could you please send something like that along?

**Speaker B:** I would recommend that the videotape themselves, or the recording, the video recording that we're doing now, would be technically sufficient. However, putting it onto YouTube and then letting YouTube do the audio to text would then guarantee that we have a good minutes, the video recording and the audio text from that video, which should be sufficient for the— yeah, I think.

**Speaker C:** I think that that's a good idea, Dhammarato. I really like that. But I think, um, there's some other kind of more things that would make the meeting go easier, like maintaining an agenda is a really important part of that, and that's necessary for the secretary as well. So I think like helping get some of those things together. But maybe we can talk, start the thread on this in the Discord. On the board Discord about like what we want to— how we want to do that. I personally don't know the answer, so I'll be learning with you.

**Speaker D:** Okay, great. I'm thinking maybe what we can do is— or, you know, I can do is go look at examples of minutes taken at nonprofit meetings and see what I come up with.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that'd be great.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker D:** Oh, sorry, go ahead, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** And that's good. That's what I'm saying is that's a good idea.

**Speaker D:** Okay, yeah, and perhaps what we'll end up doing is, you know, copy, you know, another type of board's minutes and then use the transcript to fill in any gaps and then maybe edit it because it's, you know, transcripts aren't perfect, but a bit edited and reshaped I think can probably suffice for any documentation purposes.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, yeah, that'd be great.

**Speaker B:** We may in fact want to also specify that that would be collected all in one place rather than just be kept on random files or whatever on somebody's computer, that we put it into the docx that we've already got going for the bylaws and stuff. So as we collect minutes for the meetings, we can add it to the already existing stuff. That— so that means then, Robert, that you need to start going into the documentation that they've already collected to make sure that we're keeping it all together in one place.

**Speaker C:** So actually, one point on that— thank you for reminding me— is that something that I've been experimenting with a little bit is making it easier for us to to kind of collect information and documentation in a single place. I've been playing around with a tool called Notion. I don't know if you guys are familiar with it. I know Parker is. That makes it really easy to collect information and makes it very user-friendly to find things. And so I might try to put something together to collect things like meeting notes and minutes and useful links. I'll share that out and see what people think and if people think it's useful or not. Um, but yeah, Robert, let's collab on that.

**Speaker B:** Okay, if Robert's up to that, then I'll let you and Robert and Parker take care of that. That would be good.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, because I, I feel like the Google— we have our Google Drive, but it's like kind of cumbersome to navigate right now. Uh, so it'd be nicer if it's a little bit easier, more user-friendly.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker E:** I just— I have a question about some Can you guys hear me? I don't know if my mic's on.

**Speaker C:** Yeah.

**Speaker E:** Okay, I had a question about the— in Section 2 where it says election and term of office, it says that you vote every year but then you serve for 3 years. Is that the way that's supposed to be? Or because that just seems— it just seems kind of like awkward, isn't it? Because like if you voted every year, wouldn't it be like you just serve for a year then until you got re-voted in? Or Is that normal to have it like that?

**Speaker B:** I would assume that meant that every year we have an opportunity to add or subtract board members, but once somebody is on that for 3 years, then they don't need to be voted on the second and the third year. But some people might.

**Speaker C:** So yeah, I guess we actually asked her about this because I was a little confused about this as well, and it's that every— so there, every year you vote on board members. Like adding or removing who the board members are, but there are also these like roles, board roles like treasurer, secretary, chair, and those last for 3 years. And so you only vote on those every 3 years.

**Speaker E:** Oh, okay. Okay, that makes sense. And then the other thing is, is that it says that you can't vote out the president, executive director, or agent of the organization. I mean, I don't really see that being a problem, but like, I mean, is that a good idea to like have it so that, or is that something that we have to have that you like can't vote out somebody just in case you got some like random person like somehow that I don't know.

**Speaker C:** That seems, that's, could you, would you mind showing me where you found that or just like?

**Speaker E:** It says removal or vacancy right underneath election, and term of office. In Section 3, it says the board of directors shall have the power to remove an officer excluding the president or executive director or agent of the organization. So you can remove an officer but just not the president or executive director or agent of the organization is what that section said.

**Speaker B:** Oh, that prevents a coup. I got it.

**Speaker E:** Well, that's what I was thinking. I was like, oh, we have like the benevolent dictator, hopefully.

**Speaker C:** Well, that's actually, that seems, I think what they mean is the president. So actually, like, we had a question for her about this too, is because she uses her terms of like executive director, president, chairman loosely to mean all kind of the same thing, which what I think she meant was like a board member who has like the president role. But the main kind of function of the board is to oversee the executive director and potentially, you know, boot them if it's not going well. And so we definitely want to make sure that maybe it's that the president can't be booted of— I don't know, that I don't— I feel like we should remove that entirely, that there's any restrictions on who could be booted.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, I think, I think maybe to just say like the board of directors shall have the power to remove an officer and then just like Yeah, okay.

**Speaker C:** Yeah, Parker, would you mind making that change too?

**Speaker A:** That's a good point.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so you do want to allow a coup. All right, I got it. Sometimes a coup would be necessary. I give you Russia as an example.

**Speaker C:** Awesome. Well, that's all I got for on the nonprofit stuff, unless anybody else has anything else.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah, that would be the only change that we could say is going to be made to the document that we've got now, I suppose. And, or we can have a— Robert, you can keep track of the list of changes, but right now that's the only one that we've got. Thank you for bringing that up, Joe. So where do we go from here? Do we go ahead and vote on it?

**Speaker A:** Um, yeah, we can vote on it, the 4 of us, uh, here— me, Joe, Robert, and Tyler. And then we would just need 2 more people to vote it in.

**Speaker B:** Um, well, Tyler mentioned that we can vote in the bylaws without having the quorum that's required by the bylaws, because the bylaws coming out doesn't yet exist.

**Speaker C:** Well, yeah, I guess because this was actually an ambiguous part of our original governance process. We never talked about quorum, and the board roles and responsibilities are so important that I think I almost like every board member to affirm that they understand them. That's a good point. And so I think we could probably just do a vote with us right now because that's kind of consistent with our current governance process. And but we do, we should really like confirm every single board member has read it and understands.

**Speaker A:** Yep, that's a good point.

**Speaker C:** And they should also watch this video for sure. Mm-hmm.

**Speaker A:** Okay, cool. Yeah, the show of hands for those of us here to approve the bylaws. All right, for those watching on video, Skype has a feature where you can raise your hand and everyone has their hand raised. Okay, so I guess that was the main thing for this meeting. An additional point that I made at the beginning is that we— Tyler and I did some work setting up a Discord server that we're going to try moving some of the communication to, with the intention of it maybe becoming our main place for communication if it works well for everyone. And we started that with the— we'll start that with the web group and this, the governance discussion, and then potentially also this discussion about what are the secretarial duties that we need to take care of.

**Speaker B:** That will be a Discord channel that's separate from the Dhamma dudes or the Dharma friends, right?

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker C:** Yep, that's right. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, does anyone else have anything for today?

**Speaker B:** I'm very pleased to see you all, and I'm also going to be pleased to go back to bed.

**Speaker A:** Likewise, it was good seeing you guys all. All right, well, we'll all send a debrief of this meeting to everyone on the email list, and then we can plan to meet at the same time in not next week, but the week after. All right, sounds good. Good seeing you.

**Speaker E:** See you guys.

**Speaker D:** Cheers, everyone.

**Speaker B:** See you guys. Bye-bye.

**Speaker E:** Have a nice week.


### Summary

This is not a Dhamma talk (a teaching on Buddhist principles). It is a **business meeting** for the **Open Sangha Foundation**, a nonprofit organization.

Here is a summary of the meeting:

**Primary Purpose:** To discuss and prepare to vote on the organization's **bylaws and conflict of interest policy**.

**Key Discussion Points:**

1.  **Bylaws Overview:** Tyler (Speaker C) walked through the essential legal elements of the bylaws, emphasizing they are a "minimum viable" set required for 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status.
2.  **Board Responsibilities:** The board's primary role is ultimate oversight of the organization (finances, legal matters, direction). Key requirements include:
    *   Holding **annual meetings** (with plans for more frequent quarterly ones).
    *   Taking and keeping **official meeting minutes** (Robert, as Secretary, will lead this).
    *   Managing **conflicts of interest** (e.g., board members' businesses should not contract with the foundation).
3.  **Proposed Bylaw Change:** Joe (Speaker E) pointed out a clause that seemed to protect the President/Executive Director from being removed. The group agreed this was problematic and should be **removed**, ensuring the board can hold any officer accountable.
4.  **Voting Process:** Since not all board members were present, they agreed to have the four attendees vote provisionally and then seek **affirmative confirmation from all board members** via text/chat after they review the bylaws and meeting recording.
5.  **Other Business:**
    *   **Discord Server:** A new Discord server has been set up for project-specific and board communication, separate from personal Dharma discussion groups.
    *   **Documentation:** They discussed using tools like **Notion** to better organize documents, meeting minutes, and notes in a central, user-friendly location.

**Outcome:** The meeting was administrative and organizational. The group made progress on finalizing their governance documents and operational systems, with a clear action item to finalize the bylaws vote asynchronously. There was no discussion of Buddhist doctrine, meditation, or personal practice.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speakers use a few key metaphors and one implied story to explain the formal, legal aspects of setting up their nonprofit foundation.

Here are the metaphors and stories identified:

### Metaphors

1.  **"Minimum Viable" Bylaws / Roles:**
    *   **Used by:** Speaker C (Tyler)
    *   **Context:** When explaining that the drafted bylaws and the required board roles (President, Secretary, Treasurer) are the bare essentials.
    *   **Meaning:** This borrows from the tech/startup concept of a "Minimum Viable Product" (MVP)—the simplest version that works. The metaphor emphasizes they are creating only what is legally necessary to get started and gain IRS approval, avoiding unnecessary complexity.

2.  **"Double-click on":**
    *   **Used by:** Speaker C (Tyler)
    *   **Context:** When offering to go into more detail on any part of the bylaws. ("We can like double-click on anything if anybody wants to discuss anything more.")
    *   **Meaning:** This is a common business metaphor derived from computer interfaces. It means to examine something more closely, to open it up and see the details inside. It suggests moving from a high-level overview to a granular discussion.

3.  **"The last line" / "Top of the line":**
    *   **Used by:** Speaker C (Tyler)
    *   **Context:** When explaining the board's ultimate responsibility for the organization.
    *   **Meaning:** This uses a spatial metaphor of hierarchy. The board is at the "top" (ultimate authority) and is the "last line" of oversight and accountability. It frames their role as one of final responsibility.

4.  **"Benevolent Dictator" (Implied Metaphor):**
    *   **Used by:** Speaker E (Joe)
    *   **Context:** In a lighthearted comment after discussing a bylaw clause that seemed to prevent removing a President.
    *   **Meaning:** This is a common metaphor in open-source projects and some organizations for a leader who has ultimate authority but is expected to use it wisely and for the good of the community. Joe's joke ("we have like the benevolent dictator, hopefully") playfully raises the concern of concentrating too much unchecked power in one role.

### Story / Historical Analogy

1.  **"Russia as an example" (of a necessary coup):**
    *   **Used by:** Speaker B (Dhammarato)
    *   **Context:** After the group agrees to change the bylaws to allow the board to remove *any* officer, including the President.
    *   **Meaning:** Dhammarato uses a brief, implied historical story to justify the change. He suggests that sometimes removing a top leader is not a bad thing but a necessary corrective action, using Russia (presumably referring to historical revolutions or the fall of an authoritarian regime) as a dramatic example of when a "coup" might be needed. This story frames the legal change as a safeguard against poor leadership.

In summary, the metaphors are primarily drawn from **business and tech culture** ("minimum viable," "double-click on") to make bureaucratic processes relatable. The lone story is a **historical/political analogy** used to justify a specific governance decision, adding a touch of humor and gravity to the discussion.
