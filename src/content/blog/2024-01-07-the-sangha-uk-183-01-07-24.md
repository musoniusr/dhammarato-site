### Transcript


**Speaker A:** All right, so Daniel's back.

**Speaker B:** Everybody back at the kuti right now.

**Speaker A:** Okay, now here's the funny thing. This is the, uh, the Sangha UK that was set up at this time for, um, uh, people in UK and Europe. It's Sunday morning, but But here in Thailand, it's just coming a little after 4 o'clock, and that most of the people in the group right now are in Thailand. Rick's in Bangkok, Michael is right here on the porch with us, Daniel is still in Chiang Mai. Is that right?

**Speaker B:** That's right.

**Speaker A:** And so, Rick— excuse me, Freddie, you're in London. And Martin, where are you? Someplace in Europe?

**Speaker C:** France. I'm in France.

**Speaker A:** French. Yes, I can hear the French accent. Okay, so today let's start with the phrase, the chatter in the back of the mind. Is that the phrase that you used, Rick? All right, now that's actually not possible. The chatter does not come from the back of the mind, the cerebral, or the anterior part. It comes in fact from the mid-cortex, what is referred to as the mammalian brain. But a more important quality is that those thoughts jump and move very, very quickly. In fact, I'm sure that if, let us say, 1960s and 1970s computers were part of the Buddha's vocabulary, he would use computers as an analogy. That in fact, when I first heard of this, I was in Burma, and I mulled it over and came to realize that it's an ancient teaching that's true, and that is that the mind is a serial processor. It goes from step 1 to step 2 to step 3 to step, and many times those are in cycles. So you eventually come around and come, and sometimes the cycles are very short and sometimes the cycles are very long. But one thing for sure, and that is that we have only one event at a time going on in the mind. It's like, where do you focus your attention? For instance, you can focus your attention on your eyes. And by doing so, you're looking, which is not the same thing as thinking. But often what we do is look, think, look, think, look, think, look, think, but more often we look, think, think, think, think, think, think, look, think, think, think, think, think, think, look, think, think, think, think, think. That's the way that we normally do it. Which means that we don't do a whole lot of looking, and we do a whole lot of making stuff up. And so those thoughts that you're having— another word that I've heard used is in the background. How many of you ever had the idea of the thought that you've got thoughts in the background? And when you have that thought, isn't that thought of the thoughts are in the background actually right there center stage? Right in front of you. Every thought that you ever have is right there in front. It's the only thing that we're paying attention to. But the mind, according to the Buddha, is fast. Oh, it's fast. I would say, in fact, that you probably heard of— like, the brain has waves, like alpha waves and gamma waves and No, not gamma, but delta rays, things like that. But the alpha wave is what you could call the cycle time of the mind, that the mind cycles like a processor, like a computer has instruction cycles that normally has a fetch-read-store cycle. That in fact, in the very oldest processors, in order to do a cycle, you had to read and then write it back, because in core memory, but long before we had real processors with real memory, we had core memory, and the core memory was a destructive read. So once you read, you had to write it back. Right then. So this is what we mean by cycling. And the mind is on a cycle that's somewhere in the neighborhood of about a tenth of a second. Pretty fast. Not as fast as we can measure with science, but fast enough. Okay, so whenever you look at something and you— let us say you catch something out of the corner of your eye— that's going to take a.

**Speaker D:** Cycle.

**Speaker A:** Or when you are listening to what I say and doing a slurpee at the same time, your mind is going back and forth between putting your lips on the straw and then listening and starting to suck and then listening and then having the stuff come up the tube and then listening, and then having the taste and the coolness come into the mouth and recognition of that, and then back to listening again. All right, now I know that Rick is smiling a lot because he understands what I'm talking about, but Daniel, he is more or less listening, listening, listening, but he's also darting his eyes back and forth, and so he's doing some visual stuff too. So this is We have to understand that only one thing happens at a time. There is no such thing as background. Now, let's say that in fact that you have music playing in the background because you're actually, let's say, listening to a lecture, listening to a talk, and then the music is in the background, but it comes into the foreground when you listen to it, and then you come back and then you listen to it again, and then you come back, and then you listen to it again, and then you come back, because the mind is cycling like this, and it moves back and forth and back and forth. And so when people say that they've got background thoughts, what that means is, is that they've got a certain kind of thought that keeps coming back into the foreground. And so what we actually are practicing here is to being able to control what those cycles are doing. That we're not ever trained to do that. It's funny about all the stuff that kids are trained to do in school, and the one thing that you're not able— they're not ever trained in is how to think. Now, what I mean by how to think means to be able to stay on one topic and stay on it and stay on it and stay on it, as opposed to applying the mind to it and then go someplace else, come back and then go someplace else and then come back. And there's a lot of different places to go. One of them is, is in fact, you notice that I just swallowed. That took more than a tenth of a second. And while that swallow was happening, no talking was going on. The question is, are you watching these cycles? Are you able to see that the mind is jumping from one thing to another to another? So I'll give you a fairly clear example of where the Buddha says that the mind is so fast that he doesn't even have an analogy to it. This is actually in the Anguttara Nikaya, in the ones where there is one mind, and the mind jumps, and it jumps so fast that, uh, uh, he has an analogy. So here's an example of that. Have you ever seen the planet Saturn with its rings? Right? You've heard— you've never seen Saturn planet with its rings? You're not— you're, you're refusing Daniel to see it right now, huh? And then there is the moon. That doesn't— that goes around the planet Earth, but it doesn't have any rings. So in that regard, your mind has already just gone to Saturn and then back to the moon and then back to this conversation. That's how fast the mind is. It will jump. It's almost like timeless in the sense of light is slow. They've figured it out. You know, in the old days, they thought that light was really fast, about 300 1,000 meters per second, or kilometers a second, or whatever. Yeah, 300,000 kilometers a second. But now they're beginning to understand that light itself is pretty slow, and that inside the mind everything operates at the speed of light, but the cycling time of the mind is not very fast. It's about a tenth of a second. And guess what? We can in fact measure that, and in fact we can change it and improve it. Here's the example of that: have you ever seen tests called reaction times? There's some sites on the web where they'll give you a red screen, and then we're going to change it to a green screen. And when you see it turns to green, you click the mouse. Okay, that takes about 2 mind moments. One is to see the change to green, and then the second mind moment is to move the hand to click the mouse. And they rate it that ordinary average people can take as long as 350 milliseconds. And that black belt karate people can do it in 200 milliseconds, and that there are some star athletes can do it at 180 milliseconds. Well, what that means is that now their mind is cycling at 0.9, you know, 11 cycles per second would be the way to say it. So this means then that that cycle time can be changed. It also means that we're not necessarily going to have our goal as to, let us say, shrink it down to where you're faster and faster at reaction times. Some people in fact are really, really excellent with their reaction times, and you can see that in visual sports. Like somebody can hit a baseball that's coming at him at 100 miles an hour. And so this reaction time that we have, maybe in our practice what we want to do is to begin to stretch that time out, so that the cycles become slower and slower, so that we can see what's happening inside those cycles. And then in fact, a lot of what's happening in that cycle is what we would call perception. So we look for a split second and then we think and we mull over it, and sometimes we spend a whole lot of time just cycling through trying to figure things out. This is referred to, by the way, as the hindrance of doubt, is that in fact the mind will seem so slow that it seems to actually stop. And nothing's happening much for a period of time, but then it'll start back up again. But everything is in these cycles, and these cycles are not fixed in length. But in that cycle, everything is going to be happening one event after another. There's no such thing as two of them happening, two events happening in the same cycle. And yet we refer to it as that in the sense of talking about background thoughts, where in fact those are not background thoughts. They take a cycle. They're right up front. Rick, does that make sense to you now? You're muted.

**Speaker E:** That makes sense. Yeah, that makes sense. So then it's acknowledging it's at the foreground and noticing that and then I.

**Speaker A:** Guess moving. So that if we begin to see that, then we can begin to control it. That one of the important qualities of the teaching of the Buddha, though it doesn't seem to be expressed with as much weight as it requires. But the teaching of the Buddha is a change, a method of change. Like for instance, in the teaching of Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, what we mean is, is to be able to see that Dukkha, perhaps in one cycle, and then change it in the next cycle. So everything is built on a change model, and the way that it's expressed is to be able to see unwholesome thoughts in one cycle and then change them in the next cycle to wholesome thoughts, until we can have one wholesome thought after another, after another. Now, one of the ways that you can see these cycles easily enough is by watching other people. For instance, while you're standing or while you're online here, you can take one of the guys that's on here and begin to watch what he's doing, and you'll begin to see the cycles that each one of us are going through, except for perhaps Michael there, who is pretending to be a stone Buddha, but I see his.

**Speaker D:** Smile.

**Speaker A:** All right, so this is how we can begin to see that things change really, really fast. And that if we're not up to that change, or not able to see those changes, then that means that we're behind the curve, we can't do much about it. But if we can get up on it, then we have a chance to change it. And so this is where the real practice of Anapanasati comes in, is to be able to see what the mind is doing and have a preemptive strike. To change it, rather than chasing along after it. This is what most people are doing, is that they're trying to chase the mind, rather than leading the mind. And how we do this is by playing— basically we're playing hopscotch with Dukkha. We can see it in advance when it's coming. That we can see it in an early stage, that we don't have to stick with it and wallow in it and whatnot like that. We can see it immediately. You've probably seen movies to where people have grabbed spears out of the air, or maybe when they're really fast they can grab an arrow out of the air. And then when they get all scientific and with matrices and matrix and all of that, they can grab a bullet out of the air, at least dodge the bullet. Okay, well, this is how we want to be able to handle dodging the bullets that we shoot at ourselves, the unwholesome thoughts that keep us from being happy. And once you are able to change your mind, that is a marvelous experience. In fact, in the Sutra Number 48 in the Kansambien Sutra, I mentioned this point often. That it is a major, major breakthrough when the student gets the idea or the opinion or applies the point that no matter how obstructed the mind gets, he can change it. He can come out of it and see reality as it is. Now this is an important point about seeing reality as it is, because what we perceive is what we make up. It's not real. Nothing— all the concepts and everything that we have is something that we invent. And basically, we invent by using, let us say, the equipment and the process, and the goods that we use to invent is always old stuff. And what we want to start doing is to be in the senses, for instance, looking and seeing, and looking and seeing, and being in the sense of observation. When we're in that state, then we're in reality. And when we're thinking about reality, we're in delusion. But this is the whole point about the Second Noble Truth, is that Dukkha is not caused by greed and ill-will, it's caused by our ignorance, basically our delusions about it. That in fact, when we're spot on, we can see that we want something, we say, "Aha, I see that I want that." And if we can catch it quick, we can say, "Aha, I like it, but I don't want it. Because these feelings come up really fast, they're part of the cycle, and these feelings will come up in a tenth of a second. So basically you could say then that in the teaching of Paticcasamuppada, it would go like this: that it would take a tenth of a second to see something, then a tenth of a second to process it using perception, and then a tenth of a second to make something out of that, our concept, which is called sallyatana, a tenth of a second. And then that's what impacts us, not the reality, but what we made up about reality. And then the next mind-moment is the feeling that arises. So within 5 tenths of a second or half of a second, We can go from see to feel. From see to feel takes only about half a second, because we have to spend that processing time. And when we get confused, what that means is we spend more and more time in processing. We try to make something up and it doesn't fit, and we make something up again and it doesn't fit, and we make something up again and it doesn't fit. And then finally, That's what we perceive is, "I don't know, I don't understand." And so that way, that cycling can be slowed down, so that it takes a while, so that it looks like that the mind has stopped, where in fact it's cycling through perception of trying to dig something up, trying to make something up, trying to figure it out. And it looks like that the mind has stopped, but in fact it hasn't really stopped. It's just got stuck, sort of like a record that's on the same track over and over again. But you guys don't know about vinyl records. Maybe Freddie does, but the rest of you, you've got tape, and tape doesn't get stuck in a groove, but the mind does. And that we can in fact begin to see that happening by looking and noticing So, this is another way of having a new kind of an input, that instead of watching a truck go by, or listening to music being played, we're now having the kind of mind-moment of looking at what kind of thoughts are going on during that process. This is actually the reason for the Buddhist teaching, Paticcasamuppada. And in fact, you could go so far as to say that this teaching is how the mind works, most specifically how it gets from seeing to feeling, because we get from seeing to feeling by manufacturing the present moment rather than continuing to observe and continuing to observe and getting more and more input. That in fact most people don't spend much time in input, they do a whole lot of processing, figuring it out, and then misunderstanding their concepts as reality. And so you could actually say that when someone is close to reality, when they're seeing what really is there, Not just seeing with the eyes, but seeing with the ears, with the tongue, with the body, with all kinds of stuff that's going on, would be the way that I'm talking about seeing, taking input. The taking in of the input then means that we're spending our time very close to reality, seeing the way that it really is, seeing the truth, observing what's really going on. And yet we are taught to see a little bit and then process and process and process and come up with something that's delusional. And then that's what we have feelings about. So can you make that change? Can you start watching what you make up to recognize that almost everything that's about your life is something that you have made up? And if we can come back to reality, then we're a whole lot closer with reality as being in non-Dukkha, because it's real. And so you can say that the further away we are from reality, the deeper into the Dukkha we're likely to be, of not liking what's going on because we're not paying close attention. All right, now Freddie made the point about the word meditation, and let's talk about the word meditation for a little while. First off, everybody knows that the word meditation does not appear anywhere in the suttas, that that's a word that was borrowed, and it has particular meanings to it, that in fact, um, in the Middle Ages There were a lot of Catholic monks who would, let us say, try to justify the Church's beliefs. And so they would have meditations like, "What is the Trinity?" and "What is the compassion of Mother Mary?" and "What does it mean to have the virgin birth?" You know, all of this kind of stuff. And they also had poems that would be labeled as a meditation. Basically what we're saying then is a meditation is a cogitation, it's a confused state of mind trying to figure something out, and if it does, it comes up with a concept. This is why I want to make sure that you guys understand that we can use the meditation, the word meditation, lightly, but we have to really understand that that the original use of the word meditation and what most people think is not what we're actually practicing. That we're actually practicing a change model. Can you see that stuff and then catch it before it gets into being conceptualized? Can you see the things the way that they are? And also, you can begin to talk yourself into a better state of mind. That this is where in Step 10— it's actually not a step because these things don't happen in a stepwise fashion like a march. It's much more like a waltz, so that we're all over the place. And you don't take from Step 1 to Step 2 to Step 3 to Step 4. Sometimes you go from 1 to 4 to 3 to 2 to 5 to 4 to 3 3, back and forth like this. This is what we actually mean, because the mind is really fast. But we do want to spend some mind moments gladdening the mind. This is Step 10 of Anapanasati. The gladdening of the mind actually does not necessarily just mean to have happy thoughts, but we use happy thoughts to actually change the mind state. This is an important point. We're actually changing the state of mind that we're in, and we use happy words to change that state of mind from being a victim to where nothing is right into the winner, because we've just set everything right. Yeah, this is good enough. This is the basic practice of getting everything back to reality. And reality is pretty good. I mean, you're all still alive. Hasn't one person here on this call died while we were talking? You're all still alive. Congratulations. Everything is okay. Even though we have negative thoughts, those negative thoughts haven't killed you. Brighten up already. This is the whole quality that we're actually looking for, is to be able to say everything is all right. Let's not get We've got the mind bent over and bent out of shape with our perceptions and all of our old ways of looking at things. Let's look at things in a new way, and the new way is the real way. So we keep needing to look at things the way that they actually are, and the way that they actually are is this moment is just fine. I can't think of a thing, I can't find a thing that's wrong with this present moment. Daniel, is this present moment okay for you?

**Speaker B:** Hunky-dory.

**Speaker A:** Hunky-dory. Yes, I know Dory and she is hunky. Everything is hunky-dory. Everything is okay. That's the kind of, um, gladdening of the mind that we need to do is to keep coming back over and over and over again and changing the mind out of the mind state that it's normally in. And the normal state of mind that we're in is in a state of Dukkha, a state of disappointment, a state of being a victim, a state of 'this is not good enough.' You guys know exactly what I'm talking about, you spend a lot of time in that state. And if you can remember— Dhammarato? Yes, go ahead Martin.

**Speaker C:** You know, previously you also said that we want to stay more in the senses, but sometimes when I'm watching my thought, you know, to have wholesome thought, I have the feeling that I.

**Speaker A:** Am.

**Speaker C:** More in my thought than in my senses? Does it, you know, so, or do we, you know, maybe balance the two, to be in the senses but also to watch the thought?

**Speaker A:** Yes, that in fact being in the senses, as we're in the senses, we will get distracted by the next mind moment that's in thought? Can you watch that transition? Do you know when you're actually feeling or experiencing something? When I say feeling, I'm talking about sensory input feeling, like sensation. Because the body is constantly having sensation. In fact, we are flooded with sensation. We can feel the air, we can feel the breeze, we can feel the contact, you can feel actually as your bottom is sitting on the chair, look how much of the bottom actually is sending back feedback. From the back of the knees, all around the buttocks, there's 10,000 nerves just screaming about how this chair feels. And we're not paying any attention to that. That we have information coming in about our posture, we have information coming in about our breathing, we have all kinds of sensory input. To it, that we don't generally pay much attention to because we're too busy thinking about how bad things are, rather than finding ways of letting the body be comfortable, be easy. But this is where we start to put our focus basically then, and I'll use the word focus because as you know, I'm pretty adamantly, in fact, quite hateful against the word— I can't even think of it— concentration. Yes, because we are not practicing concentration; we're in fact practicing being awake, being aware. Here's a good example: A kid is working on his computer at home, and let us say that he's a teenager writing code. Maybe he's trying to figure out how to hack his daddy's company's computers or something, and dad comes down the hall and opens the door and says good night to his son, and his son is so concentrating on what he's doing that he doesn't pay attention to dad. Maybe he'll give it one mind moment and then back to the code, and then dad gets unhappy and upset because the The boy's not even saying good night. Now let's take a trip backwards about 10 years to where the kid is only 6 or 7 years old. He's got a computer and he was told to go to bed, and now he's up past his bedtime and he's playing a game on that computer, and Dad walks down the hall. That kid can hear him. He can hear the footsteps of his dad. And he could turn that computer's monitor off and jump into bed before Dad opens the door to say good night. Right? That young child had better, let us say, sensory input, because he was not concentrating. So, whenever you're doing something like repetitive work, writing code or anything like that, what we really need to do is, on a regular basis, come back to reality. Anagami, to take a deep breath, come back to the fact that here we are, open our eyes, be here now, and then go back into whatever we were concentrating on. Now we can actually then learn to focus on that. Rather than focusing on the code, we can focus on being here now. Let's start having more and more sensory input and less and less windmill spinning in the mind. This will lead to your happiness and joy for a long time. This is the promise of Anapanasati. It's of great benefit to come into the present moment, that you gladden the mind, you brighten it up, and says, "Hey, everything is all right. Look at it. Look how nice things are." So, here's a point. If the thought comes, oh, we've got that call at 4 o'clock, and oh, I don't think that I really want to do it, okay, and then I catch that thought and I say, hey, we've got 10 minutes, let me lie here and enjoy myself, and I'll be up and ready for that call. Those are the kind of thoughts. But if I have the thought, oh, poor me, I don't want to do that call, then I won't be ready for it. And you can see that also. Oh, I've got to go to class now. Oh, poor me, I don't want to go. Or, oh, I've got to go get on the bus right now. And oh, I don't want to do that. Oh, poor me. These are the kind of thoughts that we have in a normal living. Can you see those thoughts?

**Speaker B:** Pardon? When I'm laying in bed and my alarm goes off, then I always lay in bed for like 5 or 10 minutes with the thought like, oh, I'm not awake enough, I'm not ready to get out of bed.

**Speaker A:** So, all right, well, this is, by the way, this is, by the way, why they have snooze alarms. In the old days, the alarm clock went off and it just went off and that was it. People would go back to sleep or go back and lay down, and then the snooze alarm doesn't go off and they miss work. So thank heaven for little snooze alarms. Every cell phone's got one. But here's the point, is that you can say, all right, between now and the next time that snooze alarm goes off, I'm going to lay here and really enjoy the day. This is really marvelous. I can lay here and I don't have to get up yet, and everything is fine. And when I do get up, I'll be ready to get up. And I'm not even going to get up until I'm ready to get up. And guess what? I'm already ready. So we can actually practice Anapanasati when we're in bed in the morning. I highly recommend it because most of us, we don't want to get up, we don't want to go face the day. I mean, I got so much work to do and people are wanting so much from me, and oh, poor me. You know the kind of thoughts that I'm talking about. Everybody has those thoughts. Can you see them and say, hot dog, I can change that? I can change the way that the mind works. That's the whole practice of Anapanasati, is to start looking at what kind of thoughts we have. And so when we go to bed at night, same thing: "Oh, I've got so much work to do. Oh, I'm so tired. Oh, poor me. Let me go to sleep." And then we're not going to sleep. The mind is spinning and spinning and spinning. In fact, I've heard something that's quite interesting, and that is that the easiest way to go to sleep is by pretending that you're going to sleep. Now they're actually missing a little point there, and that is that it's not really pretending, that you actually can watch yourself going to sleep. Rather than just having the mind spin with all the stuff that's going to happen the next day. So we can actually enjoy watching the body go to sleep. Oh, everything is so nice. Oh, I don't have to go anywhere for the next 8 hours. I can just lay here. Ah, everything is good. And that's how we can go to sleep easy enough. Practicing Anapanasati when we wake up, practice Anapanasati when we're going to sleep. Another time to practice is when we're eating food, because most of us, when we're actually eating and chewing, we're thinking about something else. We're watching a movie while we're chewing. And I say the while we're chewing is the movie is playing and we're paying attention to the movie as opposed to paying attention to each bite. This is a part of the practice that the monks have, and that there is actually a sutta number 2 in the Majjhima Nikaya where it talks about mindfully I'll eat this food, I'll watch what I'm doing. The monks practice withdrawing their hands from the bowl while they're chewing. Because most of us from childhood play with our food. Imagine the guy's eating a steak and there he is and he's cut with his knife and his fork and he's put a piece of steak in his mouth. What is he doing now? He's cutting the next piece while he's chewing. He's not even paying attention to that bite that he's got in his mouth. Can we actually start watching what we're eating, mull it around, find out which is the best tooth if you've got only a few left, and chew it that way. Pay attention. And then the Buddha talks about it in the sense that we don't take the next bite until all of the stuff that was in the mouth has been swallowed, down to not even a grain of rice. So the last thing that we would do is we would lick with our tongue all up and down and around, as Is there any food left at all in here? No. Now we can put the hand back in the bowl and get the next bite. That's an excellent training. And if you can train to do that with your food, you can train to do that with everything. We can begin to savor every morsel of life because we're paying attention to what we're doing. Rather than thinking our way through it. So this is why we don't call this practice meditation, and we don't even have to do it in a formalized way, going to a particular meditation hall, sitting on a particular cushion at a particular time of day with a particular bunch of people. That's all conceptualized. The Buddha doesn't say that at all. He says to get away from other people. To go to the woods, go to a tree, go to an empty hut, get away from as much sensory input as you can so that you can start to pay attention to the sensory input that is there, rather than having it scattered and busy and all over the place. And so we want to make things as simple as we can so that we can begin to focus on that which is worthy of being focused on, which is reality. So Rick, do you have anything to say about this?

**Speaker E:** Oh yeah, it makes a lot of sense. I still have to— I guess it kind of feels like, oh, you're saying that and I'm going to go to Vipassana, which is a place with a lot of people and stuff.

**Speaker A:** So when you go to Vipassana, go there as if you're the only one there. That takes a bit of pretense, but they want you to practice that pretense. They call it noble silence. Don't pay attention to all of those other people. In the sense of look at them as individuals, but look at it actually as an ocean or a stream or just the surrounding reality that's constantly in motion, constantly.

**Speaker E:** Shifting. Well, I do have a question, like what's the difference between having a sensory input of a bustling city versus the sensory input of nature, because if you just see it as it is, it's all kind of the same, right?

**Speaker A:** Ah, well, I'll tell you what. When there is too much sensory input, then it all becomes noise. The example that I would use, and I think that Frederick would know, Freddie would know quite a lot about this, is there's a difference when an orchestra is tuning up Have you ever been to a live concert where they're tuning up? When they are tuning up, they're all playing the same note, but almost every musician also not just tunes up, but they warm up and they'll play their favorite little passage. They may play a scale, they may play some chords, they may do something, but then it's noisy. You cannot even tell what all is happening because there's too much happening. This is like being in a city, but then the conductor will come up and he'll bang his baton on the podium or whatever, and now it gets quiet again. All right, this is the way that we would want to live, as if we can focus on what's really important in that city. That takes a lot of discernment, a lot of skill. This is why the Buddha would recommend start with quiet, start with nothing happening, start with the amount that you can— you've heard the idea of biting off more than you can chew. Well, the city is more than people can chew. Especially when they're unskilled at it, and it's just noisy and dangerous, and people are confused and all of that kind of stuff. That in fact, uh, Rick, you're in Bangkok now and you're not used to the city, and you can tell that the vibe is a vibe of, wow, too much is happening, there's too many people, there's too much going on. This is why we want to go and practice in quietude, in silence, so that we can manage the amount of sensory input. And yet, even when you go to the forest, you think that things are quiet and easygoing. Oh no, there's a billion things happening every tenth of a second right there in the forest also, but it's much more in harmony with itself. It's not so much noisy. It's sort of like a symphony orchestra actually now playing the music, because that's what you'll find in the woods or in the forest, in the environment that you're in. That, yeah, you'll hear the birds singing and you'll feel the breeze. There's a huge amount of stuff happening, but it's not the rumble that you find in a city. But in fact, I have pointed that out to students who have moved out of New York into a city or a place where it's not like New York, and I tell him to reflect upon it. That there was just so much going on in that city that you couldn't even keep track of it all. And so it winds up being just a bunch of noise. And what we can do instead is get ourselves into a place where it's much more in harmony with itself. So that we can find, let us say, some peace and quiet, some solitude. And this is where we want to practice and go back to that state of solitude often, because that's the best place to practice. When there's too much going on, it's hard to keep track of anything. And so we can limit the amount of input that we deal with And this is what I would recommend, that in the city the best thing to do is to go to that hut that you paid 500 baht for and go into your room and enjoy the quiet, knowing that it's not nearly as quiet in that room because there's a lot of noise, road noise. And in fact, road noise is a major issue. The city is constantly rumbling. It's rumbling at a low frequency, and we can pay attention to that when we go to the city so that we can appreciate when we're not in the city that things are not rumbling, they're not noisy, it's quiet. That in fact the same thing is true even of electricity, that when you've got electricity in your house, there's a certain kind of rumbling that's going. And when you turn that power off, or you have a power failure, immediately things begin to lighten up. It's not so oppressive. And so this is what I would recommend, is to experience the distinction. And it's hard for people to understand this because when you go into a city, you go into it slowly and things kind of build up and they're kind of up and down. But really it's very, very high, not high in the sense of the frequency, but in the sense of the volume. It's a high volume roar. And it's part of that input, sort of like the way that we eat food, that we're not paying attention to the eating of the food because there's all this other stuff that's that we could pay attention to instead, like for instance playing with our food, or ordering more from the waiter, or looking out the window, or watching television. And very rarely are we, when we're eating, actually just eating because that's what we're paying attention to. And so this is what Anapanasati is all about, is learning how to pay attention to that which is worthy of paying attention to. This is an important point, and in fact there's a sutta, number 2, that I just mentioned about the eating practice, that is talking about what is worthy of our attention. What are we paying attention to? And what the Buddha recommends is that you pay attention more and more to the Four Noble Truths. You pay attention to this is Dukkha. You pay attention to this is the cause of Dukkha. You pay then a great amount of attention to this is what it's like to be free from Dukkha. And then we can pay attention to all these little steps that we go through to get into that state, which is to see what's going on and to make a change, to remember to look at what's going on, Sati, to then look at what's going on, and then making a change to settle down. This is what is worthy of our attention, to see when we're giving ourselves unwholesome thoughts and then change that into more wholesome, happy, settled, easygoing thoughts. This is the teaching of Anapanasati. This is the teaching of the Eightfold Noble Path. This is the teaching of the entire teaching of the Buddha. Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Can you see that dukkha and come out of it? Michael, do you have anything to say about this? Um, could you talk a little bit.

**Speaker D:** More about slowing the cycles down and.

**Speaker A:** How that process works in the mind. Okay, Michael, he says that the lights are on on your motorbike. What? Yeah, our downstairs neighbor just said that your bike has got the lights on. But anyway, I'll— we'll be finished in a minute. They've been on for 2 hours now or more, so another 3 or 4 minutes is not going to hurt. Yes, the slowing of the cycles down has to do with being aware of these cycles. That will slow them down, is to see, to start watching the cycles, recognizing that things are that way, intentionally making the change to slow things down. Easy enough to do if you pay attention to it. Just let it be easy to stop being in a rush. So, Freddie, do you have anything.

**Speaker C:** To say?

**Speaker D:** I was thinking just then about the second step, or the second Four Noble Truth, like recognizing the cause. I mean, how important is that? I mean, I think you're putting more emphasis on changing.

**Speaker A:** Actually, no, the cause of suffering primarily is not the greed and ill will, it's our ignorance of it. That we don't know.

**Speaker D:** But how important is it to like to kind of identify the cause? Like how important is that? You know, let's say you see suffering. I mean, is it important to go to figure out the root, investigate it?

**Speaker A:** All right, this is basically what we can say is that there are several keys are key words that the Buddha uses to point to this. One of the words that he uses is the word hindrance or obstruction. Now, the hindrance or obstruction means that something is preventing you from being in the state that you want to be in, which is basically a state of rest, a state of harmony. The next word that is used is unwholesome thoughts. The thoughts that are unwholesome are actually Dukkha. The thoughts that are unwholesome are those thoughts that keep you from being at a state of rest. Those are the thoughts that we have to identify because in fact, if we are not in a state of rest, then some bright object will happen and then we'll go into wanting it. So can, when you like something, do you notice that you just like it and let that be rather than liking it and then wanting it? That can be as simple as seeing a cup of coffee on your table and seeing it, now we want it, as opposed to just seeing it there and letting it be. And then if we're thirsty, now we'll drink because we're thirsty, not because we saw the cup. So, can we put that in practice in the sense of recognizing that all of this input that we'll have from a city means that there's all kinds of things to want? Are all kinds of things to want to get rid of. And if we can simplify that, now we can pay better attention to what we want and what we don't want so that we're not so ignorant of it. So this is what we mean then about unwholesome thoughts or about Dukkha or about the hindrances, is that we will come Slightly attached to something, we'll want it, we'll want to change it, rather than recognizing that all the change that needs to be made is inside the mind, to come out of wanting to change it into everything's okay, yeah, it's there, so what, no problem. And so we come out of our looking and then deciding and of perceiving and then making up something and then getting attached to it. What we do instead is we continue to take sensory input rather than perceiving or making stuff up about it, making up a story, and just letting.

**Speaker B:** It be. I have a question that fits in nicely with Freddie's question, and that is, maybe you mean this as well, Freddie, is that when I'm doing Anapanasati, sometimes I will notice there is some Dukkha, and I have noticed that when I take a bit more time to investigate, then sometimes it's more effective when I do the gladdening of the mind afterwards. So when I just know there is some Dukkha and I just right away start changing to wholesome thoughts, but I haven't really looked at what is.

**Speaker A:** Going on. Ah, that's right, right. There's no reason to just automatically jump into change. We actually need to do the investigation enough to figure out what is it that needs to be changed. Which will also take more sensory input. Let's investigate, let's really check that out, and then we can make the change. You can actually say that, in fact, of tuning a musical instrument. You play the note and then you listen and you check to see, is that on key yet or not? And then you adjust it. A beginner, in fact, will adjust it in the wrong direction. He wants to make it a tiny little bit sharper, and he makes it flatter instead because he's in a rush. He's not really listening to the tones. Okay, so you can take that as the example of what you mean. And yes, I agree with you 100%, Daniel. We really do need to do more than one or two investigations. We need to investigate, investigate, investigate so that we can make just the.

**Speaker B:** Right change. I noticed that when I'm being in a state of like, oh, I cannot have any Dukkha, then I want to change it instantly. So I kind of rush into having wholesome thoughts instead of really taking the time. So now that I'm really slowing it down, it has really changed.

**Speaker A:** My practice. That in fact, in a way, I'm using the word "slow it down" as a metaphor for spending more time in sensory input rather than in perception, is to keep coming back and looking, keep seeing what's really there, keep rechecking it and rechecking it so that when we make a change, it's spot on. But most people, they're not doing that. They're not really looking. They're trying to make stuff up. That's what a meditation really is, is actually making more and more stuff up rather than recognizing what's really truly there. There's no end to the number of gods that you can make up. Humanity has been making up gods and trying to make them real for centuries, but the reality is that all we have is reality. Let that be your god. Whatever is real, that's it, rather than making stuff up. That way, when we're creative, we know what we're doing. That in fact, using reality is a way of making an invention. You know, they say that an invention, or genius, or whatever, is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. I'm not really sure I'm not sure that that's correct, but what they're pointing at is that we have to keep looking before we're tweaking. We have to investigate, and then when we're tweaking things, we can tweak it in just the right direction. So, I can imagine that Edison and his group, when they were trying to invent the light bulb, an incandescent They were just willy-nilly trying all kinds of things rather than actually investigating what would work, doing the scientific investigation. They tried carbon filaments and they tried copper and they tried all kinds of things, not getting the results. But if they'd have sat down and begin to understand why things weren't working, instead of trying over and over again, they could hit on it and say, "Yeah! Now I know!" In fact, this is actually quite famous, that scientists will work all day long, experimenting, playing, and trying to force it because they really want it to be right. And then they'll go to bed, and as they're waking up in the morning, the solution will come to them. "Oh, this is what I need!" I stopped trying to fix it, long enough to actually investigate it, and then the right thing to do comes immediately. So this is a way of talking about slowing it down when we get in a hurry to fix it, rather than making sure about what we're doing, to keep looking, keep investigating, keep noticing. Freddy, does that work for you? You understand what I'm saying? Great. Yeah.

**Speaker D:** How about you, Rick? It's an equal part. Sorry, I was going to say it's like an equal part as the flip around is.

**Speaker A:** The investigation. Which the investigation then is being real, staying in reality rather than making stuff up and making stuff up. That's what perception is, is the process of— in fact, the Pali word, there's two different words for it. One is nama rupa and the other one is pañña. But you can look at that word nama rupa and basically what it means is you're taking rupa, the reality, the real, and trying to name it, trying to grasp hold of it, trying to see what it is. And we often do that too soon, so we grab it. It's like grabbing the snake by the wrong end. Now, real professionals can grab a snake any way that they want to because they're watching very closely. But the right way to grab a snake is right behind the head. Up into the throat so that it can't bite. So we have to be able to tell the difference about which end of the snake we're grabbing. Don't grab the snake by the tail just because you saw it first. No, you got to do some more investigation to figure out where the head of that snake is so you'll know how to grab it. So does anybody else have anything.

**Speaker B:** To say? I did have one question, and that is that I noticed that when I'm following the breath, I am automatically doing the chasing of the breathing. So I'm going like from my nose down to my midriff and then back.

**Speaker A:** That's quite natural that we do kind of start at the beginning of the nose and then we'll get down into the end of the full breath, our belly rises and we notice that too. And then when we breathe out, the belly starts to fall and then we'll chase it back out. This is known for a long time as part of Anapanasati, is what they call either chasing or following.

**Speaker B:** The breath. Is it important to train yourself to notice it like in that sequence? Because sometimes I feel like maybe I'm forcing it a bit too much and I should just pay attention to wherever I feel it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's the whole point, is that chasing and following has too much structure to it. And the reality is the Sutra number 111 when we learn one by one as they occur. That in fact, when I say one by one as they occur, takes us all the way back to the beginning of our talk about the mind being in a cycle, and one thing at a time, and one thing at a time. So whatever is coming up, that's what we're going to be paying attention to, one by one as they occur. So sometimes you can go right from the nose into the belly, and sometimes while you're breathing out, you'll go from the belly to the nose and then back to the belly. That's okay, so long as you're paying attention to what the body is doing, as opposed to thinking that you're breathing and watching the breaths, where in fact you're thinking about Aunt Susie, because thoughts are mixed with Aunt Susie and the breathing. Can we in fact see that we're back and forth in that chatter and come back and just pay attention to.

**Speaker D:** The breathing? Is it possible— I have a question— is it possible to get too interested in the investigation and then get a bit lost. Like, let's say I start thinking about—.

**Speaker A:** But let's not get lost. Let's come back to the investigation rather than the concept of investigation, because that's what you're talking about, is that we get from the real investigation of actually looking into thinking about investigation. And yeah, it's okay to do a little of that, but catch it and then come back into the reality of the investigation. Rather than thinking about investigation. In fact, that's part of the problem with language and having these talks here, is that we're doing it all in conceptualization, that it's difficult for me to teach directly. And that's one of the values that I got from Ajahn Po, was that he found ways, even though he didn't speak English, Language was not so much of a problem, he found direct ways to teach. So your job here is to hear the conceptualizations that I'm using when we're speaking in language, and then take that out of the conceptualization into the reality, the actual reality of what does the shirt that you're wearing feel like? What does it feel like when your feet are touching the floor, or are they cross-legged or whatever like that? To be aware of your posture, that's reality. But thinking about what posture you want to be in, that's conceptualization again, that's nama-rupa.

**Speaker D:** That'S perception. So is investigation um, just sense your senses, or is that thinking?

**Speaker A:** Paying attention to what's going on.

**Speaker D:** Because sometimes I think I've been just going, like, using my brain to investigate too much. Like, I get lost and then I use my brain to go back in time using my memory to the— so why I got distracted. I mean, but is that— I don't know if that's right, or I don't know.

**Speaker A:** It has no value because that keeps you in the conceptualization, especially in the past. So the easier thing to do, in fact the superior thing to do, is say, never mind about that, let me have a— take a deep breath and enjoy it in this moment, rather than trying to figure out how I got someplace. That just is very much like whether we're talking about it as old age psychological archaeology or momentary. I mean, we can go back 3, 4, 5, 10 seconds and gain some value, but going about 5, 10, 15, or 20 years has very little value. And yet we spend a lot of time reminiscing about the past.

**Speaker D:** I'm talking more about this moment, the 10-second period. I'm more talking about like Just, um, yeah, just that's that period of like, um.

**Speaker A:** Because, because, and you don't recognize that when it's occurring. Now you remember doing it, but when you're actually doing it, can you recognize, oh, I'm in the past? It's only 10 seconds, but I'm still in the past. This is— yes, let me take a deep breath. The breath This is really a valuable anchor to bring you back right now into the present moment.

**Speaker D:** But I feel like I'm doing it because I'm trying to investigate the source of the Dukkha.

**Speaker A:** That's why I need to see the source of the Dukkha. Actually, we've already established what the source of the Dukkha is, is that you weren't paying attention. And so now while you're trying to figure out the source of the Dukkha, you're again not paying attention. Okay. You're conceptualizing your way into it.

**Speaker D:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. I see. Thank you for this question. That's an.

**Speaker D:** Important point. Yeah. I'm glad you answered that because I've been doing that. I've been sitting and then like I get distracted about something and then I'm like, well, I need to figure out why I got distracted and then I.

**Speaker A:** Go like— No, that's just more distractions. Instead, you can say, I dropped that. Wow, I'm glad I'm free from that. I don't have to figure it all out. I can be happy without knowing.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, it's a bit like I was kind of like trying to do some kind of psychoanalysis.

**Speaker A:** Yes, let's stop structurally analyzing stuff and just enjoy it instead. Yeah, that in fact, in a way, we can say let us stop being an engineer and start being an artist. So the engineer will take a look at that building and he'll think about how it's structured and how much steel is in it and why it doesn't fall over because of the foundation. He can find all kinds of things what's wrong with that building, to where the artist is looking at that building, "Wow, that's nice! It looks like it's going to fall over, but it doesn't! Isn't that marvelous?" That's the idea, is to come out of being the engineer and become the artist, to appreciate the way things are without having to figure out how they got that way. All right, guys, well, why don't we end the call now? Everybody happy and satisfied that we're in the present moment, we're enjoying the way reality actually appears to us rather than trying to figure out how it got here? Let's be the artist, so stop being.

**Speaker B:** The engineer. Thank you so much, Dhammarato. Thank you guys for joining.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. Yeah, thank you, Dhammarato. Good to see everybody. Yes, it's good to see everybody. Thank you.

**Speaker D:** For coming. See you later.

**Speaker B:** All right, see you.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye.


### Summary

Based on this Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key teachings and discussion points:

### **Core Theme: The Mind as a Serial Processor & The Practice of "Being Here Now"**

The talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A), deconstructs the common experience of "background thoughts" and emphasizes a practical, moment-to-moment practice of awareness and change.

**1. The Nature of Mind: One Thought at a Time**
*   **No "Background":** Thoughts don't happen in the background. The mind is a **serial processor**, cycling through single events or "mind moments" at a speed of roughly one-tenth of a second each. What we call background chatter is just rapid cycling between a thought and other sensory inputs.
*   **Fast Cycles:** The mind jumps rapidly (e.g., from Saturn to the moon to the conversation). Our practice isn't necessarily to speed this up, but to **slow down and observe these cycles** to gain insight and control.

**2. The Root of Suffering (Dukkha) and the Path Out**
*   **From Sensing to Suffering:** A rapid chain leads to distress:
    1.  Sensory input (seeing/hearing).
    2.  Perception (processing/identifying).
    3.  Mental fabrication (making up a story/concept *about* it).
    4.  Feeling (vedanā) arises based on our fabrication, **not** the raw reality.
*   **Ignorance is the Cause:** Dukkha is primarily caused by **ignoring reality** in favor of our delusional concepts and stories. We spend most of our time in step 3 (making stuff up) instead of step 1 (observing what is).
*   **The Change Model:** The core of the Buddha's teaching is a **method of change**. The goal is to see an unwholesome, unhappy thought in one cycle and change it to a wholesome, happy thought in the next. This is "playing hopscotch with Dukkha"—seeing it coming and dodging it.

**3. Practical Application: Anapanasati as "Being Awake"**
*   **Not "Meditation":** The word "meditation" is problematic; it often implies cogitation or concentration. The practice is better described as **"being awake" or "being aware."**
*   **Gladden the Mind (Step 10):** A key practice is actively gladdening the mind by talking to yourself in a wholesome way, changing your internal state from "victim" to recognizing "everything is okay right now." This is a direct antidote to the default state of disappointment.
*   **Prioritize Sensory Input:** The practice involves shifting time **from thinking to sensing**. Pay close attention to the actual sensory reality: the breath, bodily sensations (e.g., contact with the chair), the taste of food, etc. This anchors you in the present.
*   **Informal, All-Day Practice:** This isn't just for the cushion. Practice when waking up, going to sleep, eating, or lying in bed after the alarm. **Savor every morsel of life by paying attention.**

**4. Key Clarifications from Q&A**
*   **Investigation vs. Over-Thinking:** Investigating the source of Dukkha is valuable, but it must be **sensory-based observation in the present**, not conceptual psychoanalysis of the past. Don't get lost in "figuring out"; often, simply returning to the breath and the present is the solution.
*   **Following the Breath:** Don't force a rigid sequence (nose to belly). Pay attention to "one by one as they occur"—notice whatever sensation is most prominent in that moment.
*   **Simplify Your Environment:** A quiet, simple environment (like a forest) is recommended for beginners because it reduces overwhelming "noise," making it easier to harmonize with reality and practice. The city is like an orchestra tuning up—chaotic and hard to discern.

**Final Metaphor: Be the Artist, Not the Engineer**
*   Stop being the **engineer** who structurally analyzes everything, finds faults, and gets lost in how things work.
*   Become the **artist** who appreciates reality as it is, finds marvel in it, and enjoys the present moment without needing to figure it all out.

**In essence:** The talk is a guide to moving from a life dominated by fast, delusional thought cycles that create suffering to a life of slower, clearer observation of reality, where we actively and skillfully change our mind-state toward contentment and ease, right here and now.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses a rich tapestry of **metaphors and stories** to explain the nature of the mind and the practice of Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing). Here is a breakdown of the key ones:

### **Core Metaphors**

1.  **The Mind as a Computer / Serial Processor:**
    *   **Metaphor:** The mind is compared to a 1960s/70s computer with a **serial processor** and **core memory**. It processes one "event" or "cycle" at a time, moving from step 1 to step 2 to step 3.
    *   **Purpose:** To debunk the idea of "background thoughts." Thoughts are never in the background; each one takes its turn in the **foreground** during a processing cycle. The mind rapidly switches ("cycles") between different objects (e.g., listening, tasting, thinking).

2.  **The Mind's Speed & "Cycles":**
    *   **Metaphor:** The mind operates in cycles of about **a tenth of a second**. This is compared to a computer's **fetch-read-store cycle** and the **alpha wave** cycle time of the brain.
    *   **Story/Example:** Sipping a Slurpee—the mind cycles between listening to the talk, feeling the lips on the straw, tasting, etc., one tiny moment at a time.
    *   **Purpose:** To make the abstract process of attention concrete and to argue that we can learn to observe and even **slow down** these cycles to gain insight.

3.  **Reaction Time & Athletic Performance:**
    *   **Story/Example:** Online reaction time tests (clicking when a screen turns green). Average people take ~350 milliseconds, black belt karate practitioners ~200 ms, star athletes ~180 ms.
    *   **Purpose:** To show that this "cycle time" is not fixed; it can be trained. In meditation, the goal is often to **stretch the cycles out** to see what's happening within them, not necessarily to make them faster.

4.  **The Buddha's Analogy for Speed:**
    *   **Story:** The speaker references a sutta where the Buddha says the mind is so fast he lacks an analogy, then provides one: "Your mind has already just gone to **Saturn** (with its rings) and then back to the **moon** (without rings) and then back to this conversation."
    *   **Purpose:** To emphasize the incredible, almost timeless speed of thought.

### **Metaphors for Practice & Misunderstanding**

5.  **Dodging Bullets / Grabbing Projectiles:**
    *   **Metaphor:** Unwholesome thoughts are like **spears, arrows, or bullets** we shoot at ourselves. Practice is about developing the skill to **"dodge the bullet"** or even **"grab the arrow out of the air."**
    *   **Purpose:** To frame the practice as **preemptive and proactive**—seeing unwholesome thoughts early and changing the mind's cycle before the "bullet" of dukkha (suffering) hits.

6.  **Hopscotch with Dukkha:**
    *   **Metaphor:** The practice is like playing **hopscotch with Dukkha**. You see it coming (on the square) and skillfully hop over it, rather than landing on it.
    *   **Purpose:** To illustrate avoiding suffering by anticipating and skillfully navigating mental states.

7.  **The Vinyl Record (vs. Tape):**
    *   **Metaphor:** A confused, stuck mind is like a **vinyl record stuck in a groove**, playing the same thing over and over. (He notes most younger listeners know tape, which doesn't get stuck in a groove).
    *   **Purpose:** To describe the hindrance of doubt or obsessive thinking, where the mind cycles repetitively on a problem.

8.  **The Child vs. The Teenager Hacker:**
    *   **Story:** A **teenager hacking code** is so concentrated he ignores his father. A **young child playing a game past bedtime** remains broadly aware, hears his father's footsteps, and can quickly hide the evidence.
    *   **Purpose:** To argue against forced "concentration" and for broad, **situational awareness**. True practice is like the child—awake to all sensory input, not narrowly focused to the exclusion of context.

9.  **Grabbing the Snake:**
    *   **Metaphor:** Perception (*nama-rupa*) is like grabbing a snake. If you grab hastily by the tail (the first thing you see), you get bitten. A professional investigates, finds the head, and grabs it safely.
    *   **Purpose:** To stress the importance of **investigation before action**. Don't latch onto the first perception; keep looking (sensory input) to understand reality before you "grasp" it with a concept.

10. **The Orchestra Tuning vs. Playing:**
    *   **Metaphor:** A **city** is like an **orchestra tuning up**—a chaotic, overwhelming noise where you can't discern anything. **Nature/a quiet place** is like the **orchestra playing the symphony**—a harmonious flow of many sounds that are easier to process.
    *   **Purpose:** To explain why the Buddha recommended quiet, solitary places for practice, especially for beginners. It reduces overwhelming "noise" so one can skillfully attend to sensory input.

11. **The Engineer vs. The Artist:**
    *   **Metaphor:** The analytical, figuring-out mind is the **engineer**, who looks at a building and sees stress loads and foundations. The mindful, appreciative mind is the **artist**, who looks at the same building and says, "Wow, that's beautiful! It looks like it's falling over but isn't—how marvelous!"
    *   **Purpose:** To conclude the talk by advocating for a shift from **analytical, problem-solving meditation** (which is more "conceptualization") to **appreciative, present-moment awareness** ("enjoying the way reality actually appears").

### **Smaller Stories & Examples**
*   **Eating Mindfully:** The story of monks eating, not taking the next bite until the mouth is completely empty, savoring each bite as a practice for savoring every morsel of life.
*   **Waking Up / Snooze Alarm:** Using the morning resistance to getting up as a chance to practice gladdening the mind: "I'm going to lie here and really enjoy these next few minutes."
*   **Going to Sleep:** "Pretending" to go to sleep by enjoying the sensation of the body settling, rather than spinning with thoughts of the next day.
*   **Edison's Light Bulb:** The story of trial-and-error (willy-nilly trying) vs. scientific investigation (observing why things don't work) as an analogy for rushing to "fix" a mental state vs. patiently observing it to understand it.

**In summary,** the speaker uses metaphors from **technology (computers, processors), sports (reaction times, karate), classic stories (snakes, orchestras), and everyday life (eating, waking up, alarms)** to demystify Buddhist psychology. The central theme is replacing the **model of concentration on a single object** with a model of **rapid-cycle awareness**, where the skill is in observing and wisely directing the mind's natural, serial processing toward wholesome, reality-based "input" rather than delusional "conceptualization."
