### Transcript


**Speaker A:** And Ajahn Chah always talks about the point of knowing, but Thai people, when they talk about the Citta or the knower, they're also talking about the heart. So feeling and knowing is almost the same. You know, they put their— Thai culture puts more emphasis on feeling as a way of knowing, whereas the West has this long history of you know, male-dominated philosophy and science sort of devaluing feeling as a way of knowing. But in Buddhism, feeling is a way of knowing. There's 3 different aspects of mind discussed in Buddhism. You know, the Citta is sort of like the feeling mind, and Vinaya is sensory consciousness, and then the Mano is sort of like the intellectual cognitive part in the mind. And these are all different forms of mind. But what I was getting at with that is the Dhamma converges on the point of feeling. When the Buddha talks about that, he's talking about the Citta. Okay, so today is the Monday Sangha Hangout on Discord. And we were just starting to talk about the statement from the Buddha that the Dhamma converges at the point of feeling. And feeling as one of the domains of knowing in the framework of the Five Aggregates. The Buddha talks about, you know, the form aggregate, which is physicality, that which takes up space, talks about the feeling aggregate, Vedana Khanda. So that point of experiencing the world as pleasant, unpleasant, or neither pleasant nor unpleasant. That point of the Sanyakanda, which is perception or memory. It's translated differently. And then the Sankhara Kanda, which is translated differently as Kamma formations, mental formations, volitional formations. Sometimes it's translated as determination, sometimes it's translated as constructions. But the literal translation according to Tanha, Sati, and Bhikkhu is co-doings, which is my favorite translation. So I'm going to probably talk a little bit about that today. And then lastly is Vinaya, which is sensory consciousness. But this point of feeling is really important in the Thai Forest tradition. They call it the Puru, the one who knows, and they're referring to the Citta. We could argue that the Thai Forest tradition's understanding of the Citta is not exactly the same as in the suttas, but I think it is if you listen to enough talks. In the suttas, when the Buddha talks about the Citta, he's talking about the part of the mind that feels, essentially the heart-mind, as opposed to the intellectual part of the mind, the Mano, the one that sort of rationalizes, thinks, and cognizes. So the reason I brought up the Citta is I was talking about these perceptions of Anicca Dukkha and Anatta, the Anicca Sanna, Dukkha Sanna, and Anatta Sanna. And aside from the Four Noble Truths and dependent origination, these three perceptions of Anicca, Dukkha, and Anatta are what is veiled over by Avijja, ignorance. So Avijja, right knowledge, is knowing the Four Noble Truths, seeing the Four Noble Truths, seeing dependent origination, seeing these three perceptions. They're all interconnected. There's three different ways of speaking about these things, the Four Noble Truths, dependent origination, Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta, but they're actually all related to each other. And so where I was going with Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta is that these perceptions, just like everything else in the Dhamma, is aimed at uprooting clinging. The Buddha summarizes Dukkha as, you know, birth, aging, illness, and death, pain, grief, sorrow, lamentation, and despair. These five aggregates afflicted by clinging. He talks about the Panchakhandha, which is just the five aggregates. And he talks about the Panchupadana Khandha, which is the five clinging aggregates. And it's the five clinging aggregates that are the summary of suffering. And so everything that the Buddha teaches, the Four Noble Truths, Dependent Origination, The Three Perceptions, the Noble Eightfold Path summarized as Sila, Samadhi, Pañña, virtue, you know, unification of mind, wisdom. Everything is aimed at uprooting clinging, which is fueled by craving. So these things go a lot deeper than we think they do. And the normal way of human life is to avoid the realities of Anicca, Dukkha, and Arhat. We— normal human life, if we go with traditional Buddhist cosmology, you know, life in every realm of existence going back endless expansions and contractions of the universe, the way that we live is by avoiding the realities of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and, you know, non-ownership, non-controllability, Anicca, the non-self nature of existence. We avoid it by going out. The mind goes out towards the senses, towards the aggregates, and seeks pleasure and avoids pain as a way of avoiding Dukkha. Anicca, Anatta, these realities. And so through this process, we have deep-rooted Upadanas within us. There's clingings in the eyes, in the ears, in the nose, in the tongue, in the body, in the mind, in the ideas, in our jobs, in our relationships, in our likes and dislikes, in our autobiographies that we repeat to ourselves in our minds. And when we get close to seeing any of these things as they are, as impermanent, Anicca, Pañña, we experience anxiety or depression. It's a way that the mind avoids looking at it. So I like to tell people who experience anxiety that, you know, you actually have a bit of an advantage in the Dharma because there you are right there. The veil is vibrating right in front of you. Just go into it. Look deeply into what is giving rise to anxiety, because that means that you're sort of getting close to seeing something that is afflicted by clinging, which is everything. It goes extremely deep, right? So, you know, as an example I've used before, you know, we're a vision-dominated species. So we have a lot of our sense of self and a lot of our sense of security tied up in vision. Our sense of world is all tied up in vision. And if you've ever sat down and contemplated like a sudden loss of eyesight, if you really, really contemplated what that would be like, you would suddenly, you know, would feel anxiety about that because we cling to vision, right? We identify with seeing. But the Buddha tells us that all five sense doors are empty. He compares them to empty villages. If you look into seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, feeling, thinking, any of these sense doors, you see that there's, there's no nothing permanent or substantial at the core. It's just, you know, it's dependently arisen. It's an empty process of nature. And we avoid seeing this. So what I was talking about was these perceptions of Anicca, Dukkha, and Anatta. And how we avoid them. And I was, you know, it kind of was this thought process was stimulated by this Ajahn Brahm talk I was listening to where he was talking about Anatta Sanna, the perception of not-self. And he was going in it and there was like, I found that there was like a feeling of like wanting to vomit in my stomach. Some sense of self connected to my job as a teacher, as a high school teacher, was lingering in there because of some changes I had to make in my life recently. I won't go too much into the personal details. You know, there's our deep sense of self that's autobiographical, that stretches throughout our lives. But there's also multiple senses of selves connected to our jobs and the different roles that we play. And sometimes when something comes to an end, that particular self is exposed. Right. And so if in order to sort of make a breakthrough in the Dharma, we have to drive these perceptions deeper into the things that we hold most dear. And I don't know about you guys, but the thing for me that's always been the most difficult to uproot in terms of of lingering self-views is the Samskara Kanda. Like I said, the Samskara Kanda is translated often as volitional formations, formations, determinations, whatever. But like Tanha Sarabhikkhu says, the etymology of the word actually means co-doing. So ultimately what the Samskara Kanda is, is what we intuitively and typically think of as the doer within us, the one who's in control, what's called will, volition. You know, even in the history of Western philosophy, when Descartes went in to look for the self, you know, he settled on thinking as the self. He said, I think, therefore I am. And when Freud talked about different aspects of the mind, he identified the thinking part of the mind as the ego, you know, based off of Descartes' insight. So we've long since identified with discursive thought, thought in general, as the doer within us. We're very deeply— we feel very deeply identified with the doer. But if we follow the Buddha's instructions and we sort of start to reduce our activities in the world, all these different activities, all these different doings we do, these ways of distracting ourselves, watching television, having conversations, whatever it may be. We sort of go into retreat mode and we detox the senses. We allow them to settle and we practice restraint and non-activity. We'll find that the first thing we encounter is boredom or dullness of mind because the mind is so addicted to stimulation. But if we get past that threshold, we may encounter other things like depression, anxiety, But what's happening is that the activities that the sense of self is founded upon, that's grounded upon, are starting to settle and still. And the self that's dependent on that is also beginning to settle and still. And, you know, entry into Jhana has to do first and foremost— its cause is, you know, when people talk about Jhana, they always talk about the Jhana factors of applied and sustained thought. Piti, Sukkha, and Ekagata. So, you know, rapture, satisfaction, and one-directedness of mind. But those aren't the causes for Jhana. Those are the signs that the mind has entered Jhana. The cause for Jhana is expressed in every single sutta where the Buddha talks about Jhana. He says, you know, seclusion from sensuality, and seclusion from unwholesome states. So it's, it's, you know, the five jhānanas of applied and sustained thought, Piti, Sukkha, and Ekaggata, all of those, he said, born of seclusion from sensuality, born of seclusion from unwholesome states. So what does that mean? That's the important thing is to understand what that means. Seclusion from sensuality. Is something that most people have never experienced in their life. I've given the analogy of fish that don't know the nature of water. They don't know that they're wet because they've never been dry. But a frog does, right? Because a frog has spent enough time out of the water to be dry. So when it goes back into the water, it knows what it means to be wet. This is what seclusion from sensuality is. We spent our entire lives intoxicated by sensory experience. And sensuality is not just the activity of the senses. It's the desire and aversion in regard to the senses that makes up what the Buddha talks about when it comes to sensuality. So when we go into seclusion, we go into sensory detox, and we allow it to settle long enough the mind will, if our virtue is good, you know, if we aren't sort of heedless in our everyday life where we're constantly stimulating the senses, the mind will sort of start to notice. It will withdraw from the senses, essentially. The mind will withdraw from the senses and gather within itself, and then it will withdraw from the hindrances, which is, you know, the hindrances are the five negative emotional states, you can say, that are born of the Kilesas, the greed, hatred, and delusion. So, you know, that's sensuality, ill will, restlessness, sloth and torpor, and skeptical doubt. So it also— those things cease. So you're withdrawn from sensuality and the hindrances have come to cessation. And this, just this right here, this crux is something that most human beings have never experienced in their life. So it's a radical contrast to what we're normally experiencing in our lives. It's like the first time that the frog, the tadpole grew legs and crawled out of the water, you know, except more dramatic than that. And the mind will notice, you know, it will sort of see its own nature of stillness, and it will gather and settle within itself for the first time, become very stable and still. And the body becomes sort of aloof from the mind. And the first time you notice that the mind and the body exist in separate domains. And then that's when the Jhana factors will arise. You know, this applied and sustained thought, this ability to keep the mind on one single theme. The rapture and happiness, those are— those come from this sense of freedom from sensuality, because, you know, it's sort of a prison for the mind. And the Ekaggata is that one-directed unification of mind. So this is— you go into first Jhana based off of seclusion from sensuality, seclusion from the hindrances. And the mind gathers within itself. And this is what Buddhadasa calls the mind that is fit for work. And it is the foundation of insight in Theravada Buddhism, because the mind that is enraptured, intoxicated by sensuality, and constantly being stabbed and torn apart by the hindrances, our normal state that we feel is normal, even though it's very unpleasant. This is when you— this is when the three perceptions will clarify, essentially, is what I'm getting at. We don't know how unsatisfying, how painful, how much suffering is involved in our normal way of being until we've completely become secluded from it, you know. It's like I compare it to like a drug addict going into rehab. You know, maybe, you know, the drug of choice has become part of your identity. Your community of friends all use the same drug of choice. Your narratives that you tell yourself that justify the behavior is all part of your storyline. But for whatever reason, you go into detox, you get through the withdrawals, you go into rehab, and you get to a point where the mind finally becomes sober. And then the pain withdrawal goes away and the storylines that kept you addicted to those drugs break down. So that would be the hindrances in that case. And then for the first time in a long time, maybe your first time in your life, you have a moment of clarity and you see the Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta nature of that drug use. You know, that's sort of what the mind experiences in Jhana. It sees deeply into The, the everything that, that has made the mind cling essentially is seen as Dukkha, right? That's why a lot of times when you look at the suttas, the perception that Sekhas have, you know, stream-enterers and beyond, they're called Sekhas. Is whatever is arising is Dukkha arising, whatever is ceasing is Dukkha ceasing. That's just how they see anything that arises and ceases, because anything seen to— because they've had the vision of the Dhamma that whatever arises due to a cause is already ceasing, right? Whether it's happiness or sadness, whether it's pleasure or displeasure, whether it's anxiety and depression or rapture and bliss, it's all seen as not worth adhering to. The Buddha, in one sutta, summarizes the whole Dhamma as nothing whatsoever is worth adhering to, because the Buddha compares— oftentimes the kilesas are compared to fires, but sometimes it's almost discussed almost like a glue, like the defilements are what glue awareness to the khandhas, essentially. And he talks about awareness release, of relinquishing the khandhas, essentially. But the reason that first Jhana is so important is because it's sort of like only when the mind has sort of left the realm of sensuality, withdrawn from the realm of sensuality, can it really see the— to a certain level, to a deep enough level the impermanent nature of our desire for these things and these things in and of themselves. And the fact that they're impermanent makes them unsatisfying. And the fact that they're impermanent, unsatisfying, makes them completely uncontrollable. And also another thing that's significant in the Jhanas, which is kind of what I was thinking about and sort of circling around at the moment, because it's a difficult thing to talk about. Is you even— the mind even becomes withdrawn from that which is usually experienced as the controller of experience. That's what the Samskaras are. They, when we're identified with the Samskaras, we feel in control of the body, we feel in control of the mind. But when the mind goes into a certain level of Jhana, these Samskaras, these co-doings, as Tanhisara Bhikkhu translates them, or at least he says that their literal translation, are seen in the same way that the body is seen as being, you know, part of an empty process, essentially, and just an unfolding process of nature. And when this perception is brought deeply, this is where I started, these things you can talk about them all you want, but actually, when you bring them within yourself, you can feel in your experience where you get like a sense of repulsion in the body, or a sense of anxiety, a sense of depression, a sense of sorrow, a sense of sadness. You can sort of feel out where there's clinging in experience by really, really, really bringing these perceptions deep into experience. We really are afraid to take these perceptions and look deeply. And the things that you actually have to look at are the things that you cherish most. And what most people cherish most, you know, just to skip everything else, is our sense of self, you know, as me. You know, what do you cherish more than me? You know, I've been here since I was born, or so it seems, right? And the sense of me is really just rooted at different points in time, you know, in the body, the feelings, the perceptions, and the mental formations, the Samskaras, in consciousness. So the purpose of the three perceptions is to root out clinging in all of these different areas. And the purpose of sense restraint and the purpose of, in the way we talk about it here, at least in the way I understand it, of returning to a state of satisfaction, that middle way where, you know, whether it's, you know, a positive state of mind or a negative state of mind that arises, we see it as impermanent. And, you know, part of the change that can be made is the change of attitude, not just changing the mental state at a certain point, you shift the attitude from one that needs to feel good to one that's okay with allowing things to arise, degrade on their own, and pass on their own until the mind is happy in that still point in the pendulum, that middle way at the perception of impermanence, where things are allowed to sort of arise, persist, and pass on their own, and the mind gets to a level where it's not moved by these things. So these are just some things that I've been thinking about recently, but I'll check in with you guys and see if anybody has any thoughts about that or any of that, questions about it.

**Speaker B:** I guess I've got a question about the change of attitude that you mentioned. Is there any sort of where in.

**Speaker A:** The.

**Speaker B:** In the Pali canon, for instance, that he sort of goes into this idea of the change of attitude.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So Dhammarato talks about Samma Sanghappa as right attitude. It's normally translated as right thought, right inclination. And the, you know, the sutta definition of Samma Sanghappa is is non-greed, non-hatred, non-delusion, and renunciation. So our normal attitude is to want things that are pleasing, want things we don't have. That's greed. To hate things that are displeasing, to want to get rid of things that we don't like. That's hatred. Delusion is seeing things wrongly and thinking that we're seeing them rightly. So traditionally, seeing things that are impermanent as permanent, seeing things that are unsatisfying as satisfying, seeing things that are not me or mine, not controllable or ownable, as me and mine, as controllable and ownable. So, and the deepest delusion, of course, is self-view. But that one's always so difficult to talk about. But so right attitude is non-greed, non-hatred, non-delusion. So instead of a mind that's constantly chasing after what it finds appealing, running away from what it finds as repulsive, and sort of just being confused in general, which is sort of the root of those other behaviors. And that it sees what is, you know, sees reality rightly, what is impermanence as impermanence, you know, unsatisfactoriness as unsatisfactoriness, non-self as non-self. And then the renunciation aspect of right attitude. Go off. The renunciation aspect of right attitude is a reorientation of mind. So our mind is normally directed outward because of greed, hatred, and delusion. And when we're in the early stages of the practice, We understand that we're abandoning things externally. But when you enter the noble stage of practice, when you cross that threshold into the noble Dharma, which is really where the Eightfold Noble Path begins, you understand renunciation as I know it as an internal practice. So what we're actually renouncing is craving and clinging. And Bhavana existence. We're renouncing birth and death, essentially. So we're renouncing wanting things we don't have, trying to get rid of things that we don't like, this way we've been living our lives. Renouncing that delusion. We're adopting the three perceptions, and we're renouncing clinging. So taking things personally, taking the world personally. Seeing myself at the center of experience, everything that's happening to me, we're renouncing that. We're renouncing, you know, it's a shift. Bhante Poonyaji calls it a shift from existential thinking to experiential thinking. So because we don't understand how the process of perception and cognition and affection work, you know, the perceptual aspect of the mind, Vinaya, the cognitive aspect of the mind, Mano, and the emotional part of the mind, the Citta. We don't understand these three processes properly, so we take the objects that they create as things. Essentially, Bhante Poonyaji calls this existential thinking. And so that's how the sense of self, the sense of the world, and the sense of relationship between self and world is created. Anyway, so that's Bhavana, essentially. It's a deep scene into— Bhavana is usually translated as becoming, but it's better translated as existence. It works as becoming, but You know, when the Buddha was trying to solve suffering, he came to the conclusion that, that the idea of existence itself is a wrong view that's created in the mind. Because if you see, if you see dependent origination clear enough, then you don't see people, places, and things you see, you see sort of a continuum of causes and conditions where there's nothing static or permanent anywhere in it, right? The something that is static or permanent is only a concept in the mind. I've talked about this before as like, you know, the Mississippi River. It sounds like a thing. We say the Mississippi River, but it's only a thing in our mind. It only exists in the mind. It's as a concept, it's objectified by the mind as the Mississippi River, but really what it is is part of a larger context that we call the water cycle, right? The Mississippi River, you know, the Gulf of Mexico, and I can't remember where its headwaters are, one of the lakes, one of the Great Lakes or whatever, you know, they're also part of the water cycle. The oceans are part of the water cycle, the atmosphere, the clouds, it's all part of the water cycle. That's a continuous, ongoing process that's governed by this law of determinism, right? So when you see dependent origination, it uproots any perception of a thing anywhere in experience. What you see instead are causes and conditions giving rise to experiences, and the Buddha narrowed down his focus just to one phenomenon, which is Dukkha. So I don't want to get too complicated, you know. So dependent origination is a specific case of determinism. You know, we can look at it broadly, at how the universe is governed by this principle. But the Buddha, you know, the broad principle he spoke of is this: with this, there is this; with the cessation of this, this ceases, right? With the arising of this, there is this. With the cessation of this, this ceases. That's his broader— that's his broad articulation of the general principle of determinism that governs life. But he focused that principle on experience, at how Dukkha comes into being and how it comes into cessation. So that's what Paticcasamuppada is, right? And when that is— when that is seen clearly, you know, through continuous introspection, through Jhana, and then through applying the three perceptions while in Jhana, you can't— it uproots any sense of a self because a self is an entity, right? The Mississippi River is a self, you know, Michael, you know, whatever it may be, anything you give a name to. You know, nama-rupa, name and form, right? Anything you give a name to is technically a static concept that the mind creates, when reality itself is quite dynamic. So you're trying to uproot this perception within your own experience, within these three, these five domains of experience that the Buddha calls the five khandhas. And so you examine the body through Anapanasati. You see that the body is a dynamic process. It's made up of You know, in the suttas they talk about hair of the head, hair of the body, nails, teeth, and skin. And then they go through the different organs and whatnot. But in our modern understanding, we could talk about the respiratory system, the nervous system, the circulatory system. The body is made up of all these different systems. The limbic system, it's a collection of systems. And then, you know, the mind is also made up of these different systems that that condition each other, you know, feeling, thinking, perception. When you examine these different systems, you can't find anything permanent within them. It's actually what Bhante G— I can't remember how you pronounce his whole name— he wrote Mindfulness in Plain English. He's a really great monk, but he translates Sakadagami as the view of permanence, essentially having the idea that there's anything permanent within experience. When you look at experience through the lens of the three perceptions, through dependent origination, through the Four Noble Truths, it uproots your ability to see something permanent within experience, and that lightens the burden of life. Because the thing, and sort of what I was kind of thinking about before this call, and this is probably going to be more tangential than most of the talks that we've had here, just because this is sort of something I've been circling around. But the thing that we are most attached to as ourselves, more than anything— well, we talk about putting down the body, you know, in the modern world it's kind of easy to see that we're not the body, right, necessarily, that the body belongs to nature, that most of the body is driven by unconscious processes. We still identify with the body, but most people who get into Buddhism have a pretty good idea, you know, of the conditionality of the body, of the impermanence of the body, of the unsatisfactory nature of the body, of the non-self nature of the body. But it's really— what's really difficult to uproot is identification with the doer and the knower. These are the other— this is the Samskara, that's the doer. The aggregate of doing, you could say. It's one way of thinking of it. And then the Vinaya is the aggregate of knowing. That's— it's really difficult to uproot the sense of ownership, the sense of controllability within those two aggregates. And, you know, I'm not going to try to go on about uprooting that, but the point I'm making is that The three perceptions of Anicca, Dukkha, and Arhat are meant to be internalized to the degree where you kind of find where you're most afraid to apply those perceptions, you know, because that's how you discover clinging. You kind of have to like take the cap off of it, you know, you have to kind of look at where you're most— where you grasp the most strongly. You could start with external things like your job, your house, your family. You know, you could say, okay, these things are impermanent. You know, everything that arises due to a cause is already ceasing. You know, the beginning of the sort of the building of a wave is already the beginning of its ending, right? That's that opening of the Dhamma eye that Anicca and Pañña expressed. You know, all arising phenomena are already ceasing phenomena is a more accurate translation of that. You see the cessation already in the arising of something. If any of you guys have had children— have any of you guys had kids? Any of you parents? This wasn't just me. I've talked to other parents. But when your child is born, So not for everybody, maybe, but your first thought is, now they can die. You know, it's sort of the terror of becoming a parent. You know, once we talk about— we test this, just going on a little bit about Nichjasanya. You know, we talk about life and death, like those are the two opposites. But that's not the opposites. Birth and death are the opposites. Like, the actual cause of death is birth, right? Something coming into being is the reason why it ages and dies, right? So you can apply Anicca Sannyā to that, you know, externally in that way to help you release your sense of ownership and your sense of satisfiability over external things. But, you know, the that's sort of the beginning, right? And then the deeper level of practice is when you start applying the perception of impermanence to everything you hold dear within these five domains of experience: the body, you know, the feelings, the memories, the perceptions, discursive thought, verbal, you know, thought, these internal narratives that we live in and as, and sensory consciousness, you know. So that's that reorientation is another way to think of Samma Sanghappa. It's taking right view, which is that first of the Noble Eightfold Path, which is, you know, seeing the Dhamma, seeing dependent origination, seeing the Four Noble Truths, seeing the three perceptions, and orienting it inward. That Samma Sanghappa is a reorientation. It's turning that view inward and uprooting the clinging that is hiding at every level of the mind. And yeah, so anyway, I'll stop that train of thought there, but check in, see if there's any other questions. Sorry if I'm a little more tangential than usual today. Had an interesting week. I know, I know.

**Speaker B:** Sorry, sorry, continue. Oh, sorry, I was just going to say a lot of what you were saying sounds like the teachings on emptiness, like from Nagarjuna.

**Speaker A:** Anagami.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, which I've learned that through Robert Byer, who was a student of Tanha Saru Bhikkhuni.

**Speaker A:** He wrote a really good book on.

**Speaker B:** Dependent origination, dependent arising, which I'll put up before. It's called Seeing That Frees.

**Speaker A:** And who's the author? Ah, yeah, yeah, you know, Nagarjuna didn't his interpretation of dependent origination and his discussions on emptiness, he didn't really, in my opinion, invent that because all of that is in the early Buddhist texts. Even the analogy of the chariot, the Bhikkhuni Samyutta, are the verses of ancient nuns. They're these beautiful utterances, poems by Bhikkhunis, you know, female monastics expressing their liberation. And Bhikkhuni Soma, or Sona, I think it's Soma, her verse, you know, Mara comes to her. And, you know, Mara is, in my opinion, equivalent to the snake in The Garden of Eden, you know, the snake convinces Eve to eat of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, basically to destroy paradise by personalizing it. You know, Anapanasati, they don't know they're naked, they have no sense of self, they're essentially just, you know, they're just unbound selfless experience. That's what makes Eden a paradise, right? And then they eat of the fruit and which knowledge of good and evil is judgment, right? And they develop a sense of self. That's why when God comes in, he sees them hiding. They say, I'm hiding because I'm naked. He says, how do you know that you're naked, right? The self-view has been born in them. And it was the snake who convinced Eve. Mara plays the same role in the suttas. He's always trying to take— and, you know, it's said that even after the Buddha's awakening, Whenever we have like difficult days or weeks in our practice, we can't really be hard on ourselves because it's said that Mara followed the Buddha for 7 full years after his awakening and eventually gave up after he realized there was no way into his mind. And, you know, the Buddha was the Buddha. So Mara is never going to stop following us around. So let's just put it that way. That's all of the— that's all of the ways in which craving knows how to convince us to cling again. You know, to start feeding it again, to start feeling it again. But Mara comes to the Bhikkhuni Sona in this verse, and he says to her— what does he say to her exactly? He says something along the lines of this creature, referring to her body, is getting old. I can't remember exactly what he says to her, but her response is what I remember. She says, basically, Mara, you must be deluded. What is this creature you're referring to? This is nothing but an assemblage of parts. Just as when an assemblage of parts that were once scattered or brought together are designated by convention as chariot, so these five aggregates, when they're brought together, are designated as creature. So I think Nagarjuna stole that. Anyway, that is, that's the analogy that Nagarjuna uses for emptiness. But what's significant there is, is it points directly to, yeah, like what I'm talking about here. And Buddhadasa goes through this as well. He talks about the 9 Das, the 9 I's, and he's using a Thai pun here because the word Da in Pali is a suffix that is like -ness, -ness, that nominalizes a word or it adds emphasis to it. So Anicca, Dukkha, Anattata, Sunyata, I can't remember all 9. Dhamma, Dhammatittata, Dhammaniyamata, Arhat, and it ends in Atamayatā. So what Buddhadasa is talking about here is how when you get to the 13th step of Anapanasati, it's contemplating permanence, contemplating Anicca, and that Anicca is the gateway to all of the other perceptions. So when you've gone through mindfulness of breathing, mindfulness with breathing, right, while breathing in and breathing out in the first tetrad, you calm the body, you relax the body, you tranquilize the body conditioner, which is the breath, and you realize in the first tetrad that, you know, just like an air conditioner conditions the air in a room, the breath is the body conditioner. So that the nature of the breath directly conditions the quality of the body. So you bring the body into a very relaxed state in the first tetrad, and you realize that the body is the fundamental conditioner for the body is the breath, right? The body depends on food, it depends on all kinds of things, but fundamentally it depends on the breath, and it's also conditioned by the breath. So that's an insight, but it's also a training. So not only do you realize that the body stands dependent upon the breath, but also that you can use the breath to tranquilize the body. So you tranquilize the body, you then— the body becomes tranquil, it becomes secluded from sensuality, secluded from unwholesome states. That gives rise to first Jhana. So Piti and Sukkha become the next two objects in Anapanasati, because you're in First Jhana at that point. And then the insight there is that feeling is the mind conditioner. So Piti and Sukkha condition the mind. The Buddha says a happy mind is easily unified. A unified mind sees things as they are. This is a pattern of conditionality the Buddha talks about constantly. So in the second tetrad of Anapanasati, you use Piti and Sukkha to condition the mind, to tranquilize the mind, to concentrate the mind. And, you know, that goes into the third tetrad of the mind or the mental states, where you can use these feelings from the second tetrad to concentrate, unify, liberate the mind, meaning like to have the mind, at least in this moment, relinquish craving and clinging. So, or clinging specifically. So then that is what Buddhadasa calls a mind fit for work. So those first 3 tetrads put the mind into at least the first Jhana, where the mind and the body— I know people don't talk about this a lot, but there's a clear distinction between the mind and body. Their domains completely separate. It's the body will either feel like a faraway thing or like it's not there at all. And then even there's an even further separation of the activities of the mind from the mind. So thinking, thought and perception, feeling, these things also sort of like detach from the mind. And so when the mind is— when sort of the aggregates, or whatever framework the Buddha gives, the Four Foundations, when the distinction between each of the domains is clarified in that way, it's like you're taking the parts of the chariot apart, essentially, right? And then you get into that fourth tetrad, which is the insight tetrad of Anapanasati, the insight and liberation tetrad of Anapanasati. You apply the perception of impermanence, that 13th step, to the practice itself while the mind is in Jhana. And you see, you know, the impermanence of the body, of the feelings, of the mental states. And by seeing their impermanence, you see that they cannot be satisfying. So the perception of impermanence leads into the perception of Dukkha, a deep perception of Dukkha. It's almost like a repulsion, you know, with sensuality, with the body, with ideas, with all of the things that you've been caught up in your whole life. And that leads into the perception of Samatha, because you see that there's no controller in there. What you've taken to be the controller is these Sankhara, these mental formations, these mental intentions. But what you see is that they're part of a causal chain, essentially. And the sense of control is sort of a reflexive feeling that's part of that causal chain. But you see that this sense of control and ownership is actually just— it afflicts all of the khandhas due to craving and clinging. And so that's not there when you're in Jhana. So there's already a lack of a sense of ownership in it, but there's a deeper sense of sort of locating that owner, that controller, when the Samskara khandhas are discerned and you see sort of there that they're nested within a causal sort of chain. And so the sense of ownership, then that Anatta, Sannyata is uprooted, or at least seen through, right? While you're in this 13th step of Anapanasati, And then that brings about the Sunyata, Sannyā. That's what I'm getting at here is the perception of emptiness. Emptiness is essentially the culmination of— well, it's the culmination of everything. You can say it's one of the qualities of Nibbana, but in the way that Buddhadasa talks about, it follows Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta. So when you see things as impermanent, as unsatisfying, as unownable, it's not self. You see them as empty. Not empty emotionally necessarily, but, you know, in the analogy I use where we used to look at a storm and personify it and think that's a god who's angry. Now we look at a storm and we see that's a conditioned arising. You know, it's governed by natural law. That's emptiness. We don't see a self in a storm. This emptiness in the Pali suttas takes different forms, but the most frequent is empty of self and what belongs to a self. So there's no mere mind, there's no self, there's no owner or controller in anything. That's what emptiness is. The perception of emptiness is that there's no owner or controller anywhere. In nature, essentially. And then Buddhadasa goes further with it. He goes, you know, after you've seen impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, non-self, emptiness, there's this sense that things are just what they are. I think that's the Dhamma, that he calls it naturalness. Things are just what they are. They just are what they are. Um, you know, they're just natural. They just go by nature, you know. And then Dhamma, Niyamata is like, okay, natural law is actually what's governing all of this, uh, not just externally but internally. We always— we— it's so funny because in our society we know that nature is governed by natural laws, but we have so much trouble understanding that there's no point of— there's no point where we're separate from that, you know. Um, I've used the analogy about how birth is really just a perception, existence is just a concept, right? By looking at the fact that we call— we say mammals are born, humans are born, sheep are born, right? Anything that's a mammal, we say it's born. But birds, we don't say they're born, we say they hatch, right? And what's the difference there? They're both— it's just, it's both a process of growth and decay or whatever, you know, an ongoing dynamic process of nature. But why do we say that mammals are born? It's because when the baby exits the womb, that's a perceived point of separation. So Birth conceptually is a perceived point of separation. And that is why when the Dhamma is seen, birth and death are brought to an end, because you don't see a perceived point of separation anywhere, right? It's all part of an intricate causal process, you know. So nothing is taken Nothing is seen to be me or mine. Now, there is a sutta where a monk, you know, is talking about how he's seen all these perceptions thoroughly, but he still has a sense of subjectivity. Essentially, it's not exactly what he says in the suttas, but it basically is what he's talking about, the sense of like experiencing. And the Buddha tells him, or maybe it's Aryabhutta, it's either the Buddha or Aryabhutta, he says, you should understand that that sense of I am, that sense of subjectivity belongs to the aggregates in the same way that the scent belongs to the flower. So it's just a quality of the aggregates, you know, it belongs to the knowing aggregate or the Sankhara aggregate. So that sense of subjectivity is not what goes when the sense of ownership and the sense of me is uprooted. But anyway, that's sort of beside the point. So I'll just return to Mudita's Nine Dhas, just finish them up real quick. I don't remember all of them right now off the top of my head. He talks about itta, pachayata. I think it's the second to last one, which is that this-that conditionality, seeing that like deep law of nature as being what's governing everything. But the important thing is that last one. Atamayata. And for some reason, only Buddhadasa talks about Atamayata. He calls it the last word of Buddhism. And essentially, he translates it as unconcoctability. And I mean, everybody talks about this. I mean, all the advanced monks talk about this as like the real goal of the practice. But Buddhadasa kind of puts it with this word. But anyway, it's when the mind can't be conditioned by anything. And there's almost no way of talking about this without creating the concept of a separate, like a separate knowing awareness when that's not necessarily what's intended. Because there's— if you've read like Mind Like Fire Unbound by Tanhisara Bhikkhu, or you've experienced deeper Jhanas, there is sort of a level of experience where like greed, hatred, and delusion come to cessation and awareness is like released from the khandhas, essentially. And You know, Ajahn Dunn calls this— he's a Thai forest monk— he calls this the mind that doesn't depend on consciousness as its cause. Ajahn Chah talks about this as, you know, he doesn't have such an esoteric way of talking about it, although he hints at it, but Well, the way the Buddha talks about it when he talks about Nibbana, because Nibbana is one among like 33 words the Buddha actually uses to describe the goal of the practice, you know. And if you look at the other 32 descriptions, it paints a little bit more of a complete picture of what the practice is actually getting at. But in this essay that Tanha Saro wrote, which is, or, you know, Ajahn Geoff wrote, which is actually just a kind of like a curation of suttas with a little bit of commentary in between. He points out that our modern understanding of when the Buddha talks about Nibbana as like the fire going out, our mind immediately goes to like non-experience, essentially like a blacking out of all experience. Because of how we understand fire nowadays, which I would argue against that, but if you sort of understand fire. But he said that in the Buddha's time, fire was understood to sort of almost exist in potential but only manifest under particular conditions when agitated, essentially. So when the Buddha talks about Nibbana, he talks about the unconditioned, unbinding, the cessation of greed, hatred, and delusion, and, you know, the uprooting, the destruction of ignorance. There's a sense in that whether it's the— there's a sense of sort of unbinding the aggregates, essentially. It's the only way I can say it without making it sound like I'm talking about something, something separate. So, but anyway, the point I was trying to get out there actually, before I got a little sidetracked with that, with that mind like fire unbound thing, was this this imperturbability of mind, essentially, when what we call the mind sees clearly, sees properly, it essentially rests within its natural state and is not sort of stirred to attraction or aversion or delusion. And that's what Buddhadasa talks about when he's talking about Atamayata. So, and you know, this is sort of what the Middle Way is about. It's about— I call it that— the point in the pendulum where it comes to rest. The way that we are addicted to stimulation, we don't let the pendulum come to rest. We keep pushing it. So it keeps swinging from happiness to sadness, happiness to sadness, you know, rapture to depression, whatever it may be. Whenever the mind— whenever we feel good, we grasp it and we hold on to it, fuel it. And then of course that triggers birth, and then there's a decay, and then there's death, and then we go into the unhappiness, and then we just spend our lives swinging back and forth essentially. And anytime the mind gets close, the pendulum gets close to settling in the middle way, we experience boredom, restlessness, anxiety, depression, essentially anything to avoid that natural state of rest, which is the natural state of the mind. If Dhamma Dasa was here, he would have said that already, probably. And so from the beginning through the middle and to the end of the path, it's really about discerning the middle way. It's hard, sort of uncomfortable in the beginning because we're so addicted to the two extremes, that the idea of giving up chasing after what feels good and avoiding what doesn't feel good and just being okay with things at rest, we're very avoidant of that. But that middle point, which Ajahn Chah, you know, he calls that middle point the perception of Anicca, the perception of impermanence. If we just rest in the perception of impermanence, so when happiness arises, instead of chasing after happiness, we just say, oh, you know, a happy mental state has arisen, whatever, you know. When sadness arises, oh, you know, a sad, unhappy mental state has arisen. We know the happiness is impermanent. We know the sadness is impermanent. We know the dullness is impermanent. We know the drowsiness is impermanent. We just continuously return the mind to its own resting place in the knowledge of impermanence. And gradually we cease fueling this whole cycle that the Buddha called Samsara. And gradually, gradually, everything starts to cool down. And this is what I feel when Dhammarato talks about satisfaction. He's talking about this resting place, this everything is good enough, things are okay exactly as they are, you know. And that sense of well-being gets deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper as craving and clinging lose fuel. And as a cycle of birth and death stops happening. When you go from a good mood to a bad mood, that's essentially what the Buddha is talking about with birth and death. And whether or not you accept rebirth as a doctrine, let's say, you know, the way that rebirth is understood is that, you know, the mind is continuously assuming different positions within the same five aggregates. That's why in the suttas, the Buddha will say at the breakup of the body when he refers to like the normal person's death. But when he refers to the death of an Arahant or a Buddha, he talks about the breakup of the aggregates. He doesn't actually refer to the aggregates breaking apart in the case of like Upadana's death, or even, you know, Srotapanna or Sakadagami or whatever. The But what you can see, because the Buddha is really a phenomenal— Buddhism is a phenomenological teaching, it's an experience, it's not an existential philosophy, it's an experiential practice— is that we are assuming a subject position within the aggregates continuously, always. And the idea in rebirth is that that just kind of continues. After the breakup of the body, that we just assume another point of view within the aggregates. But you don't actually have to take that on as a view in order to understand, you know, rebirth as it's happening here and now. You know, you may be— you may wake up in a good mood and then end up in a bad mood and then back in a good mood. You know, that is the mind being born into one state or another continuously throughout the day. So returning to satisfaction, returning to the natural state of the mind, returning to the resting place at the knowledge of impermanence is the way that we interrupt this cycle of rebirth, essentially, because we're tired of it. You know, you're supposed to be sick of it at this point, so that the mind just kind of comes to stillness. It's like you've been shaking the snow globe your whole life, and now you're just going to put it down and allow the debris to settle and everything to become clear so that the mind can see things as they are and stop going outside of itself, chasing after pleasurable things, running away from just unpleasurable things and whatnot. Nice.

**Speaker B:** It reminds me of Ajahn Chah's— he describes it as if you're sitting in your living room in the only chair in the house and you have the visitors coming and going, but you're taking.

**Speaker A:** Up the only chair.

**Speaker B:** And yeah, I sort of— I really understand what that means now, now that I've started to sort of get into this notion of satisfaction that I found through Dhammarato. To just, yeah, like you were saying that, but exactly, to sit there in that sense of stillness and peace, and it feels so good. You don't need anything.

**Speaker A:** I mean, dissatisfaction is what makes you get out of the chair. Yeah, once you get out of the chair, then the defilements can come and sit down. Yeah, you said watch out for that as well.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, to, um, I guess to look out for that as well. Like, I guess that's the becoming as well. Like, notice that little, that just that little inkling, that first little, um, you know, subtle thought that comes up that says, oh, I should do this. You know, that's that, that I'm assuming that's what you're sort of, um, pointing to with the, the doer.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I mean, if we were the doer, there's agents in there, you know, there's agency in there, there's will. It's just not ours, you know. If it was us, then, you know, we'd only eat the best food. We would, if we wanted to have, like, you know, we'd have complete control over our thoughts, feelings, emotions, and what the body does. You know, we sort of participate in it. We don't have full control over it. But the way that participation works is that you add Samskaras to the Samskaras that are there, and that moves it in a different direction. This is why the Buddha says one of the conditions for stream entry is wise friendship. You hang out with wise people. And their wise Sankharas make their way into your being, and that changes your thoughts, your words, and your actions, right? Because Sankharas are verbal, are mental, verbal, and bodily. So that's those co-doings, you know, those determinations. Determination is a good word too, because it sort of nods to the law of determinism. That is just another translation, you could say, of Paticcasamuppada. But conditioners are like conditioners. Yeah, that's another. Yeah, you talked about a conditioned existence. These are the conditioners. They are, they are that. Yeah, they're the conditioners. And then Sankhata are the conditions. It's like before meeting Dhammarato, nobody ever told you that you can just choose to be satisfied, right? So, so him telling you that, that's a Samskara, it's a verbal Samskara. And now that idea, I mean, you know, you could think of those ideas too, that idea is now in your consciousness. And if you've, if you've understood it then that choice is always available now to like be able to return to satisfaction. But if nobody ever told you that you can just choose to be satisfied, you may never— you may go your whole life thinking that you have to earn the right to be satisfied, right? That you need to like do things to be satisfied, you need to get things to be satisfied. But just that one little idea that you can just choose to be satisfied is a very, very powerful Sankhara, to just use the language I've been using. Yeah, I mean, I veered off of the way that Dhammarato teaches today, just kind of went into a lot of stuff I've been thinking about this past week. So hopefully it wasn't more confusing for you guys than usual, but that's just kind of what came out, I guess. But anyway, yeah, that's— anyway, that's, that's sort of like why there's will but there's not free will. It's like the mind— I'd like to think of the mind as like, if you just think of it as like a circle and it's filled with these various Sankharas that we've gathered throughout our life through words, through images, you know, through seeing other people's behavior. When a new piece of information enters the mind, that's when a new choice is available, essentially. So one thing conditions another, essentially. That's sort of what— when that's clarified, that's when the non-self nature of that khandha becomes more clear. That it's a collection of intentions, thoughts, ideas, you know, that are interacting with each other in a way and moving in one direction or the other. And when you add, you know, the Dhamma, which one translation of the Dhamma, you know, there's, I think they said like I think scholars have come up with like 60 different translations of Dhamma, but Bhikkhuni talks about 4 apart from the one main one, which is the Dhamma as the Buddhist teachings. And Bhante Punyaji talks about the Dhamma as thought and the Buddha Dhamma as the thoughts of the Buddha. So encountering the Buddha Dhamma is like adding the thoughts of the Buddha to your consciousness. So when it really gets in there, it's almost like there's no going back because it's kind of always working its way around inside of you. You know, it's like you've uploaded a program into your computer, a new program into your computer, and it's leading you back to it. You know, you gotta have a relationship with— like when you're reading a book, you're with that person even though they're not around. You're with that person and you're having a relationship with that person, but you got to keep coming back to it to sort of get their essence sort of rubbing off on you. And then, yeah, you know, which is interesting that— That's very good. I really like what you're saying. How you doing today, Michael? Thank you. I said a lot of things today. Oh, what's that? There's two Michaels here. Sorry, was someone speaking? I was just saying thank you. In, in In terms of how Dhammarato teaches, like, how important would you say, like, extra knowledge of, like, the suttas, etc., like, how important is that to have? Dhammarato would wisely say that you need just enough Dharma. I like that because I have an addiction to the knowledge. To information. It used to be to all kinds of information. Now it's just— now it's just Dhamma-related information. But, but he's right. You know, there's 17,500 suttas roughly, and they're all about the exact same thing, and they all are for the same exact purpose. You know, Anagami, Dukkha, Nirodha, the uprooting of clinging, essentially the extinction or the extinguishing of greed, hatred, and delusion. The three perceptions, you know, they're there to break the mind's addiction to its harmful behaviors, you know, its self-wounding, I guess you can say. But, you know, you can, if you can triangulate, just there's, you know, you can get the whole picture from one sutta if you have enough insight. But if one sutta is not enough, then you can put together a few. And also it's about putting it into practice. You know, Ajahn Chah always talked about theory and practice and how the experience of practice is never going to match up perfectly with the theory. And if you get too into the suttas, and I've done this to myself, I'm still in recovery from doing this to myself. Then, then they could cause you to constantly question even really, really good results in practice because you're kind of always worried, oh, is this a wrong view? Or, you know, am I— is this coming from delusion? So I mean, you can— the suttas can be beneficial or they can be harmful depending on how you use them. But the same thing is true for meditation. Like in the traditional understanding, meditation can turn into sitting around wanting things that you don't have. It can turn into sort of like self-delusion. So I think it's a healthy balance between reading the suttas and seeing how they apply to practice. So, but I think there's a reason why the Buddha said wise friendship is the whole of the holy life, and, you know, which is because if you practice alone only, then you can fail to see when you're deluding yourself, whereas friends are really good for pointing that out, I think. Or just if you find that people are annoying you or irritating you, then you know that your practice is not working. Because I mean, that's, that's an easy thing to overcome, you know, like irritation with people and sounds. Like that, I, I've, I listened to, um, some people who've been monks for 30 years still talking about being irritated with sounds or other monks, and I'm like, what have you been doing for 30 years? How does that even possible, you know, like, but, um, everybody's progressing even if it takes a whole lifetime. Yeah, it's— anyway, it's just, you know, but I guess everybody has different challenges, um, different things that are harder to get over. So I guess that's another good thing about wise friendship. I like how Buddhadasa talked about why the reason that wise friendship is the whole of the holy life is because he said one understanding of Arahant means without enemies or far from enemies. And so externally, an enemy is somebody you have ill will towards. Internally, the enemies are the kilesas, you know, greed, hatred, and delusion. So, and Dhammarato talks about making friends, you know, he always talks about everything is okay and everyone is a friend. Or he used to say that a lot. And I think that's another good summary of the practice. Everything's okay and everyone's a friend. You know, that's a great way to quench greed, hatred, and delusion. Everything's okay is a great way of giving— undermining greed. You know, you don't need anything but what you have. And everyone's a friend is a great way of undermining ill will. Because it's a complete freaking stupid waste of time to have ill will towards anybody in the world because it has zero impact on them. It only hurts you, you know, like it's Yeah. So anyway, call today, Michael, this has been really splendid. I'm going to go ahead and stop the recording now and get out of here. But please feel free, everyone, to hang out and continue delighting in the Dhamma. Thank you, Michael. Yeah, thank you, Michael. I really appreciate you. I appreciate you too, Alexander. It's good to hear your voice. Thank you very much for your talk.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by **Speaker A (likely a teacher or senior practitioner)**, explores core Buddhist concepts centered on **feeling (vedanā) and the "three perceptions" (anicca, dukkha, anattā)** as tools to uproot clinging. Here is a concise summary:

### **Core Theme**
The entire Dhamma converges on **feeling** (vedanā). The path aims to uproot clinging (upādāna) by changing our relationship to feelings through insight into impermanence (anicca), unsatisfactoriness (dukkha), and not-self (anattā).

### **Key Points**

1.  **Feeling as the Heart of the Dhamma:** The talk begins by emphasizing that in Thai Forest tradition (influenced by Ajahn Chah), the *citta* (heart-mind) that feels is central to knowing. Western thought often devalues feeling, but Buddhism treats it as a primary domain of experience (the vedanā aggregate).

2.  **The Purpose of All Teachings:** The Four Noble Truths, Dependent Origination, and the three perceptions (anicca, dukkha, anattā) all serve one goal: **to uproot clinging**, which is fueled by craving. Suffering is defined as the **five clinging aggregates**.

3.  **How We Avoid Reality:** Our normal habit is to avoid the truths of anicca, dukkha, and anattā by chasing pleasant feelings and avoiding unpleasant ones. This outward movement toward the senses reinforces clinging. Anxiety or depression can be signs we are getting close to seeing clinging in operation.

4.  **The Three Perceptions as Tools:** The perceptions of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and not-self are to be **applied deeply to what we cherish most**, especially our sense of self. This is where we resist most. For example, contemplating the potential loss of eyesight can reveal how much we cling to and identify with vision.

5.  **The Deepest Clinging: The "Doer" (Saṅkhāra):** The hardest clinging to uproot is to the **saṅkhāra aggregate** (volitional formations, "co-doings"). This is our sense of being the controller, the thinker, the "doer" (like Descartes' "I think, therefore I am").

6.  **The Role of Jhāna and Seclusion:** To gain deep insight, the mind must be **secluded from sensuality and unwholesome states (hindrances)**. This "sensory detox" allows the mind to settle (like a snow globe). This seclusion is the cause for **jhāna**—a state of unified, rapturous stillness where the mind is "fit for work" and can see the true nature of the aggregates clearly.

7.  **The Path of Practice (Anapanasati & the Middle Way):**
    *   Through practices like mindfulness of breathing (ānāpānasati), we calm the body and mind, leading to jhāna.
    *   In that settled state, we apply the three perceptions to see the emptiness and conditioned nature of all aggregates, including the sense of being a "doer."
    *   The ultimate goal is to **abide in the "Middle Way"**—a point of rest and **satisfaction** where the mind is not pushed and pulled by craving and aversion. This is a natural, peaceful state where things are "okay as they are."
    *   This satisfaction undermines the cycle of "birth and death" of mental states (good moods/bad moods), which is a present-moment understanding of saṃsāra.

8.  **Emptiness and the End Goal:** Seeing anicca, dukkha, and anattā leads to seeing **emptiness** (suññatā)—the absence of a self or controller in any phenomenon. The final goal, hinted at with terms like *asaṅkhata* (unconditioned) and *Nibbāna*, is an **unconditioned, unperturbed mind** freed from greed, hatred, and delusion.

9.  **Practical Advice:**
    *   **Change of Attitude:** Cultivate *sammā saṅkappa* (right intention/attitude): non-greed, non-hatred, non-delusion, and renunciation (internally, of clinging).
    *   **Use Discomfort as a Guide:** Feelings of anxiety, repulsion, or boredom are indicators of where clinging is present. Investigate them.
    *   **Wise Friendship:** This is essential. Good spiritual friends and teachings implant wholesome "saṅkhāras" (mental formations) that steer us toward the Dhamma. As Dhammarato teaches: "Everything is okay, everyone is a friend."

### **Conclusion**
The talk weaves together doctrine (khandhas, dependent origination) and practical meditation (jhāna, ānāpānasati) into a unified map. The path is an **inward reorientation** from chasing feelings to resting in mindful satisfaction, using the three perceptions to dismantle clinging—especially to the cherished sense of being a permanent, controlling self—until the mind reaches a profound, unshakable peace.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors, analogies, and stories** to explain complex Buddhist concepts. Here is a breakdown of the key ones:

### **1. The Frog and the Fish (or Tadpole)**
*   **Context:** Used to explain "seclusion from sensuality" (withdrawing from constant sensory stimulation).
*   **Metaphor:** Most people are like fish that don't know they're wet because they've never been dry. A frog, however, has been out of the water and knows what it's like to be dry. Similarly, when the mind withdraws from sensuality through practice (like a frog leaving water), it experiences a radical contrast and understands its true nature for the first time.

### **2. The Drug Addict Going to Rehab**
*   **Context:** Illustrating the process of withdrawing from sensory addiction and hindrances to achieve clarity (Jhana).
*   **Story/Metaphor:** Like a drug addict whose identity and community are tied to drug use, our normal mind is addicted to sensory stimulation and narrative. Going into "detox" (meditative seclusion) allows the mind to become sober, break down the addictive storylines (the hindrances), and see the true nature (Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta) of its previous "addiction."

### **3. The Empty Village**
*   **Context:** Explaining the emptiness of the sense doors (sight, hearing, etc.).
*   **Metaphor (from the suttas):** The Buddha compares the five sense doors to empty villages. If you look deeply into seeing, hearing, etc., you find nothing permanent or substantial at the core—just a dependently arisen, empty process.

### **4. The Assemblage of Parts / The Chariot**
*   **Context:** Explaining emptiness (Sunyata) and non-self (Anatta).
*   **Metaphor/Story:** Referencing a sutta where the nun Vajira (or Soma) responds to Mara. She says that just as the word "chariot" is a convention for an assemblage of parts, the term "creature" or "self" is just a convention for the five aggregates (body, feelings, etc.). There is no permanent entity, only a collection of conditioned parts. The speaker notes this is the same analogy Nagarjuna later used for emptiness.

### **5. The Pendulum**
*   **Context:** Describing the Middle Way and the mind's addiction to oscillation between extremes.
*   **Metaphor:** The mind is like a pendulum constantly swinging between happiness and sadness, pleasure and pain. We keep it swinging by grasping at pleasure and pushing away pain. The Middle Way is the still point at the center where the pendulum comes to rest. We avoid this rest with boredom, anxiety, etc., but the path is about letting it settle there.

### **6. The Air Conditioner**
*   **Context:** Explaining the first tetrad of Anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing).
*   **Metaphor:** The breath is like the body's air conditioner. Just as an AC conditions the air in a room, the breath conditions the quality of the body. By calming the breath, you tranquilize the body.

### **7. The Snow Globe**
*   **Context:** Describing the mind's constant agitation and the goal of practice.
*   **Metaphor:** The mind is like a snow globe that has been shaken its whole life (by craving, aversion, stimulation). Practice is about setting it down so the debris can settle, allowing clarity to emerge.

### **8. The Only Chair in the House (via Ajahn Chah, mentioned by Speaker B)**
*   **Context:** Discussing the attitude of satisfaction and non-grasping.
*   **Story/Metaphor:** You are sitting in the only chair in your living room (your center of peace/satisfaction). "Visitors" (thoughts, moods, defilements) come and go. If you get up out of dissatisfaction, the visitors can take the seat. The practice is to stay firmly seated in satisfaction, not giving up your seat to craving or aversion.

### **9. The Mississippi River**
*   **Context:** Explaining how concepts create a false sense of permanent "things."
*   **Metaphor:** "The Mississippi River" is a concept that makes a dynamic process seem like a static thing. In reality, it's part of the larger, continuous water cycle. Similarly, what we call a "self" is just a concept applied to a dynamic, conditioned process (the five aggregates).

### **10. The Scent of the Flower**
*   **Context:** Addressing the residual sense of subjectivity even after deep insight.
*   **Metaphor (from the suttas):** A monk who has seen through much still has a sense of "I am." The Buddha (or Sariputta) explains that this sense is like the scent belonging to a flower—it's just a quality of the aggregates (specifically the knowing or forming aggregates), not an owner. It's a natural quality, not a self.

### **11. Uploading a Program**
*   **Context:** Describing how exposure to the Dhamma (wise teaching) changes one's inner conditioning.
*   **Metaphor:** Hearing a teaching like "you can choose to be satisfied" is like uploading a new program into your computer (your mind). Once it's in there, it runs and reshapes your options and perceptions from within.

### **Summary of Core Themes:**
The metaphors collectively illustrate:
*   **Withdrawal & Contrast:** Moving from ignorance to knowledge requires a radical shift in perspective (Frog/Fish, Drug Rehab).
*   **Deconstruction:** The self and experience are composite, empty processes, not solid things (Chariot, Empty Village, River).
*   **Stillness vs. Agitation:** The goal is a natural, undisturbed state, not the constant chase of extremes (Pendulum, Snow Globe, Only Chair).
*   **Conditioning & Change:** Our mind is shaped by causes, and new input (Dhamma) can recondition it (Air Conditioner, Uploaded Program).
