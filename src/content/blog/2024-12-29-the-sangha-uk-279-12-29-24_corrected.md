### Transcript


**Speaker A:** My thing still says it's zero. There it goes. All right, well wake up folks, it's Sunday afternoon here in Thailand and 29th of December. So this is the last talk of 2024. What a relief. All right, so today let's talk about nobility. Who was it that asked the first question?

**Speaker B:** I did.

**Speaker A:** Tell us what that question is.

**Speaker B:** I asked how do nobles interact with each other? Like what do they do, what do they talk about? How do they engage with each other? That question came out of the last time we talked with Eric Bernay. Like I went and bought the book, I read some of it and then I'm wondering, well, how do they interact?

**Speaker A:** All right, Edward Bernays, I haven't talked about him in a long time. Are you sure you're not talking about Eric Byrne? It might be my.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it might be my pronunciation.

**Speaker A:** Well, neither Bernays nor Eric, as far as I know, were noble. Good psychiatrists don't always equate to nobility. One thing that they know how to do is look at clients. That in fact that's what Sigmund Freud is best known for. They call it empirical, empirical psychotherapy, which means that the psychotherapist looks at his clients, he studies them closely. That in fact the entire point of psychotherapy started with that and that it's well known in certain psychological circles, but not generally known that Eric Byrne was not a therapist, that in fact he didn't even want to try to cure. He was doing diagnosis. Well, we do diagnosis first, but we do it with the idea of doing the cure. Back in the old, old days when televisions were really televisions at 30 frames a second and 400 by 600 pixels, that was done on broadcast. Televisions had tubes and the tubes would go out often. And so every little town actually would have a television repair store. And the reason I'm talking about this is because in all cases the whole point of breaking yourself, your television to the repair shop was to get it repaired. But if the repairman cannot figure out what's wrong with it, then what he will do is he will start substituting parts that oftentimes, in fact for many, many years cars were repaired that way. That's why you would get such a high bill, is because they would make a diagnosis. If that didn't work, then they'd leave that new part in charge you for it, and then go fix something. EL and so that is actually the issue here is that psychotherapists then for many, many years, in fact psychiatrists are also known as psychoanalyst and that indicates that they will take your television in and they'll analyze it and then they'll give it back to you for a high fee and tell you what's wrong with it, but they can't fix it. And so Eric Byrne was actually a student of Sigmund Freud, and he was trained in that vein. I think, in fact, Carl Young and Adler and several Reich and several of the other students, Maslow, they all became very famous in psychotherapy. But the problem was is that none of them ever learned how to repair the damage that was done. They were very, very excellent in figuring out and giving people diagnosis, diagnostic. Nowadays they give diagnostic cod, and oftentimes you can go to two different psychoanalysts or two different therapists and they'll give you two different, or maybe three or four different diagnosis. But the question is not just knowing what's wrong. The question is, can we make a cure? And that making the cure then requires a change. And so I'll introduce you to now a concept that you probably heard before. If you've never heard of this concept, please indicate so. All right. The concept is fake it till you make it. How many of you have. Everybody's heard that? Has anybody not heard that phrase, fake it till you make it? All right, it's got two qualities to it. One is that you're a fraud, right, because you're faking it. But the other way of looking at it is, oh, no, the one who fakes it till he makes it, he's actually practicing and probably practicing correctly. When I was a student in high school giving, I remember one time that I made giving a concert. In fact, I remember that I was playing a Beethoven piece and I fluffed it a little, but I just went right on. I learned something very important at that moment. And that's one of the things that musicians have to learn to do. You can't stop and punish yourself and slap your hands because you made a mistake. You just trudge right on, right through that bad passage and get it into what you can play. And so faking it till you make it actually is the way to become noble. In fact, you've heard so much from so many people. You've heard about the Buddha, you've heard about Bhikkhu Buddha, Dasa. You've listened to what is being said. All we have to do is practice that and literally fake it. Fake being a noble until you make it. That's all there is to it. And when you catch yourself not being noble, what are you going to do? You're going to pick yourself up, dust yourself off and boogie on down the noble path. Chris, does that make sense to you? Yeah, yeah. How about 10,000 hours in? Go ahead, Chris. What'd you say?

**Speaker C:** I said get your 10,000 hours in. You're going to make mistakes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's right. We got to practice. We'll practice. What? Practice being a noble. What is a noble? Well, one of the things is the noble, he owns the world, he owns his environment, he's on top of the world. You've heard me say that before. In fact, I use generally in this analogy the word emperor. Everyone is an emperor of their own pile of dirt. Everyone's an emperor of their own pile of dirt. In other words, you own your shit. The question is, are you going to be buried under it? Are you going to be clawing your way out of it? And that's generally the way that the Western Buddhists think about it, is clawing their way out of it. Are you just going to sit on top of your world? Sitting on top of the world? Okay, that's what we're going to do. We're going to practice not clawing our way out. We're going to practice already being on top of the world. Santiago, does that make sense to you? Okay, well, you ask a question about how do nobles deal with each other, that's actually a problem right here on these Sunday afternoon calls. What do I mean by that? Nobles, once they recognize a noble when they see it, and one of the ways of talking about it is it takes one to know one. So when you're practicing noble and behaving noble, other nobles will see the nobility within you. It takes one to no one. And when nobles know each other, they're friendly with each other, but they don't have much to say. For one thing, there is no question and answer section generally then in fact, you can begin to understand that he who is acting, asking questions is actually in that moment not acting noble. When we have questions, that means that there is confusion and the noble minded, not confused. He is the emperor of his own pile of dirt. He recognizes dirt for dirt, but he is on top of it. And so this is how we practice. So another way of saying it, in fact, you can see some suttas like this, several of the suttas, in fact, there's so many suttas that talk about it like this that you got something's there. Now one of these suttas was when I forget his name, but he was the son of King Bimbisara and He went to visit the Buddha, and as he approached the Buddha, he did a circumambulation three times. That's out of old Indian tradition that you circle something. And so Buddhas nowadays, in ceremony, they'll circle. Have you, Chris, have you ever been in one of those circumnamulations? They do it on holidays.

**Speaker C:** Ordination too?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, ordinations. They do a circumnamination of the board. Now, the board at Watson Moke is huge. It's huge partly because it's not a building inside of it. It's just got the seamstones and it's on a very, very open, sandy area. They cleared the top of a big hill and it's huge. And for that reason, even though there's a huge crowd, the circumambulation is so huge that it would be done one at a time or kind of single file, as opposed to other circumnamulations that I've been to. It was like five or six or eight people deep going around. So this prince was going around the Buddha. And the point was, is that all of the Bhikkhus that were there were just sitting in silence. The Buddha would sit in silence with his group. There is another story about that. The Buddha was just sitting there in silence with all of his students and he picked a flower. He picked a flower and he held it up and he looked at it. And some of the students would smile because they got the point in this regard. What's the point, Ivan? I'm picking on you. When the Buddha flower and held it there, it didn't say anything. And some of the monks smiled because they got the point. What's the point?

**Speaker D:** I don't know.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's a pretty close answer, Mikey. I was going to pick on you because I knew you'd give that answer, so now I'll pick on you. Second, what's the point?

**Speaker D:** There's no point.

**Speaker E:** Yeah, there's no point.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. There's nothing to it. That's exactly right. There's nothing here. So that's what the nobles will recognize within each other. There's no reason to have a long chat, have a long Dhamma talk. And in fact, the only reason that I continue with these Sunday afternoon talks is because there might be someone who doesn't get the point yet. And if you all got the point, we could just sit here and smile at each other, have a smiling contest with no rep. So this is a way of looking at the nobles, is that there's not much to say because they each Recognize the nobility in each one, which means they recognize there's nothing there to it. Everything is so easy, Ivan. It's easy because there's nothing to it. And right now you're in that phase of like the three year old child that's riding down the hill on his tricycle and you're beginning to pick up some speed and it's almost scary that there's nothing to it. But you can keep saying, wow, this is just great. There's nothing to it. I've got it made. You don't have to advertise you've got it made. If you go around telling people you've got it made, those who haven't got it made don't believe you. And those who have also got it made will see that. And you don't have to tell them. I think, in fact it's quite amusing that so many, in fact. Was it you, Ivan? I'm not sure who it was. Just recently was saying that they made. They met someone who claimed to be an Arahat. No, it's not me. The middle path as orthogonal or something like that.

**Speaker D:** It's Eric, I think, Erica.

**Speaker A:** All right. And the answer to that is, is that I've seen actually quite a number of Westerners who will claim some sort of attainment or another. In fact, there's probably more Western Arahats by claiming than there are Arahats in Thailand. And yet I have been told by someone years ago who I trusted was in that realm, told me that there was about 25,000 Arahats in Thailand. But he wasn't sure because there's no way to count them. Can you imagine taking a survey? And one of the questions on the survey is, are you soda pond? Are you so dummy, Are you Arahat? Those who are truly noble don't even bother to answer that question. So back to the point that I was making about fake it till you make it is that even when you're faking it, you have to remember to fake it. And when you remember to fake it, guess what? Maybe you're not faking it at all. Maybe you're actually doing it. Maybe you're practicing correctly. So the practicing correctly is getting yourself into happy state. Allow yourself to be noble. So when someone criticizes you, who are they actually criticizing? They criticize you because number one, being critical means that they're not noble and number two, they're blind and don't see you as noble. And so it's like the blind talking to the blind about the blind. And you're not blind. So they're not talking about you at all. So why do we think then that we have to answer the criticism as criticism? Because they don't even know who you are. And you can do that any and every time that you feel like you're being criticized. Hey, they don't know who they're talking to. They don't know what they're talking about. But you don't say that to them. You just kind of remain silent, which is nothing much to say. You're not going to convince them that you're right, especially if this is on Reddit, because they're actually trying to start an argument in the first place. And that's something that I learned from a Chan po is that the best way to practice being noble is by being silent. Gosh, there's too many people practicing correctly right now. Let me see if I can rouse you out of it. Santiago, am I answering your question for you? All right. Does that mean that you're going to practice being noble? Well, there's nothing more to say to you then. Except that I don't understand you when you're chewing gum. Would you take it out? Well, he passed that little test very well, didn't he? Because an ordinary person said sorry. All right, so we're defining a noble then, as one who already has any and everything he needs. He's got strength. You can call it strength of character. And in fact, a lot of people will think that your local arahad is quite a character. But the real strength is not strength of character, but it's rather the strength of mind. And in this regard, what we mean by strength of mind is that we're using the wise part of us, the adult part of the mind, the frontal cortex, if you will, to ride herd on the more primitive part of the mind that we will call instinct. Others will call it intuition. The word intuition has got a little bit of trouble with it because often people will use the word instinct, intuition, when they're actually meaning instinctual. But sometimes the word is used in other words, as a substitute for the word insight. To see directly, to see clearly. And that that's what we're actually practicing while we're practicing being a noble is we're practicing and seeing clearly without the fog of instinct, without the fog of especially the self preservation instinct. Because if you criticize someone and they take the criticism, it comes out of self preservation instinct. Oh, he attacked me. Maybe I should attack him back. Because after all, an offense is a good defense. And yet when the mind is noble, There is no offense, there is no defense. We don't have to defend ourselves because we don't see the attack. We see it actually is just ignorance instead. And so if the mind is noble and is in charge of the instinct, that's actually the same way as talking about it from the perspective of the emperor is an emperor of his own pile of dirt. His pile of dirt is actually instinctual. And we come out of our instincts, we come out of our self protective mode. We come out of our, let us call it the hurting, the herding instinct and turn that into nurturing. And we take the territorial instinct or the tribal instinct and turn that into sangha, and we take the procreation instinct and kind of let it die. And that's something that's hard for most of the students of the Buddha is to recognize that you don't have to build anything, you don't have to do action. I've said before, I'll mention it again, this is out of sutta number 57, the dog duty aesthetic. And I'll tell you a little bit about the dog duty aesthetic is that he pretended to be a dog as a spiritual act. You'd be surprised what these Hindus can come up with. He was a dog duty aesthetic, which means he didn't eat food out of a plate, he would eat it off the ground. He would bark and do the kinds of things that human, the dogs would do when they're pretending to be a dog. Excuse me, I got that backwards. But say he pretends to do the things that dogs would do when dogs are acting like dogs. And so he asked the Buddha about his spiritual practice and this Buddha said to him that if you fail at being a dog by practicing being a dog duty aesthetic, then you'll go to hell. And if you succeed at being a dog duty aesthetic, you will become a dog. And the poor dog duty is that he didn't like that at all. He didn't like that he cried. And so the Buddha talked about four kinds of actions. And the first kind of action everybody's heard about, Christianity is based upon it, Hinduism is based upon it, Islam is based upon it. In fact, almost all religions are based upon it. Even the old religion of Europe before Christianity, which is called Wiccan, is based upon these two actions of comma, and that is if you do good, you will have a good result, and if you do bad, you will have a bad result. Isn't that widespread even here in Thailand or supposed to be a Buddhist country? How about that, Chris? You've Heard that before. Do good and get good results and do bad and get bad results. And isn't that the. The object of the precepts?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, that's part. Yeah, you froze.

**Speaker A:** To the dog duty aesthetic. That. Go ahead.

**Speaker C:** You were frozen. I was wondering if Mikey was still connected.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you brought. You. You. You were frozen. I'm not sure everybody else was, whether they were frozen or they just sitting here listening. But in any case, I was asking you about the twin aspects of karma, that if you do good, you'll get good results, and if you do bad, you'll get bad results. And even Thai man has that in the form of the Buddhist precepts. Is that not the case?

**Speaker C:** I won't argue that.

**Speaker A:** All right, Please do.

**Speaker C:** No, I said I won't.

**Speaker A:** Oh, you won't. Oh, all right. Well, never mind.

**Speaker C:** And so the question you asked me was, isn't that the point of the precepts? And I. Not sure I totally agree with that. But it's a flavor. Part of the flavor.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. All right, okay, I'll agree with you on that point. It depends upon who the precepts are being given to. Let us say it like this. If it's the high school principal that's about to beat the poor kid in the butt and gives him the precepts right there in the principal's office, you could pretty well guarantee that it's right and wrong if the precepts are being given at an ordination. Not so sure, huh? So the third kind of comma that the Buddha mentions, the third kind of comma is that if you. Most action. In fact, I'll just say it, most action is mixed, giving mixed results. You've heard it in the form of crowds have a silver lining, or you don't really know what the results are going to be, good or purely bad. Even doctors, when they're practicing medicine, they're not always doing it for purely good. They want to get paid. And so their motives are almost always mixed. In fact, you could go so far as to say that almost all actions, whether they're good or bad, are almost always neither actually good or actually bad. But more than likely, they're mixed. Even a bank robber can show compassion. So if we understand it that way, we can also understand the fourth one, which is the one that is much more difficult to understand in general, and that is that there is a kind of action that is not bright. It's not good, and it is not bad. It's not dark. It's just action. And if we engage in that kind of action rather than the first three. It will bring you to the end of action. Now that's the part that's so hard to understand is how can an action bring you to the end of action? And the answer to that is because almost all actions have to do with the quality of right and wrong, good or bad, socially acceptable or socially not acceptable, etc like that. Which brings us around to the story of Adam and Eve. I know how many of you heard my version or Biga Buddha, Das's version of Adam and Eve. It's not Christian. Christians are all worried about talking snakes and the woman did it first and we got to cover things up with fig leaves and God threw us out. That's the Christian version. The Bhikkhabudadasa's version of the story of Adam and Eve is that they ate of the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil. What that means is they had to put up with the results of their actions. And what are their actions? Their actions are based upon the knowledge of good and bad and that their actions based upon the knowledge of good and bad. The results of that was that they no longer lived in paradise. They were kicked out. God didn't kick them out. They destroyed paradise through their judgments. And so if we can stop our judgments of good and bad, then we will stop most of our actions of good and bad and bring our actions to a kind of stillness. Hence my talk about the Arahats. Takes one to know one, and when they know that the other one is noble, there's no reason to talk much. They can just sit happily in silence together. So in that regard we can talk about. Well, when someone then has a noble mind, the likelihood. Oh, wait a minute, Martin, Go right ahead. This is a good point to talk.

**Speaker F:** I have a question about this. It may be stupid, but aha.

**Speaker A:** That was one of the difference. It may be stupid.

**Speaker F:** What's the difference between good and bad and wholesome and unwholesome?

**Speaker A:** Ah, good and bad are judgment calls based upon liking and not liking. And wholesome and unwholesome are based upon whether they're satisfying or unsatisfied. So unwholesome thoughts keep us in a state of dukkha. There's a major difference between the two, but it sounds very subtle to many people. Thank you for asking that question. All right. We are taught from childhood to see things as good or bad, and good and bad both require action. Okay, Both of them require action. You have to have good action to get good results and bad action to have bad results. However, when we see it as wholesome and unwholesome, then if it's wholesome, there's nothing to do. And if there's unwholesome, let's just change it to wholesome, and then there's nothing to do. And wholesome versus unwholesome is a slight change in our perception. That's all it is, is it's a perception. But when we see it as wholesome and unwholesome, that makes it easy to practice. We can fake it until we make it, but if you're stuck in good and bad, one supposedly better than the other, you got to go do the good. You got to go do the bad. And now you're stuck in that duality, the duality of good and bad. But wholesome and unwholesome is not a duality. It's a direction from the unwholesome to the wholesome. Does that make sense for you, Martin?

**Speaker F:** Yeah, I feel the difference.

**Speaker A:** I think you're breaking up. I think you're frozen.

**Speaker F:** No, thank you. Yes, it's more clear now, but it's not totally clear, but I think it's good enough.

**Speaker A:** All right. It's going in the right direction. Fake it till you make it. Stay with. Let's remove the unwholesome thoughts and replace them with wholesome thoughts. And if you see things good or bad, that's probably unwholesome also. I made this statement one time, and I'm not sure whether I want to withdraw it quite yet or not, but the statement would be, almost all action then is unwholesome. Hence, the Arihaus are just going to sit around and smile at each other with nothing much to say. Deidre. Hello. I'm glad to see you. Go right ahead.

**Speaker G:** Yeah, I just want to make a remark about the words good, bad, wholesome, unwholesome feels to me a little bit like it's like approval or disapproval. So wholesome and unwholesome is more. I guess that's also the way maybe the Buddha would say that in the teaching and approval and disapproval, like, good and bad is there even in the good. Like, oh, you did that very well, or, look how beautiful you made this, or you're a good woman or a good wife or a good husband, whatever. There's this. This thing of approval. Approval or disapproval, what you're trying to say is keep out that. Keep out of that. Keep out of the. Also, the. The things you think are good is still a judgment.

**Speaker A:** Okay, we can take approval and disapproval one more step, and that Is if it's approved, then you're kind of safe. And if it's not approved, then you're in trouble. Things are dangerous. Which brings it back then to a self preservation instinct. If I do something that's really downright unapproved, like getting a prison sentence while I've been a child molester, that's really dangerous. I killed for that. Trying to shoot a president, that's dangerous. I could get killed for that. When the teacher points and says, there's an idiot at the end of this ruler and you ask which. And that's downright dangerous because that ruler might get used on you. That's an important point about good and bad. Always has that quality of approval. Disapproval down to the point of danger, fear and death. All right, and you've heard me say this before, let's make sure that we understand it. Is wholesome and unwholesome is often seen by the students as wholesome is good and unwholesome is bad. And I'm trying to get you to see that that's not true. That wholesome is good and unwholesome is bad. Is normal thinking about just good and bad. Let's put it this way. Ignorance of unwholesome will keep you in that state of good and bad is downright wholesome. Aha. I see you, Mara, is exactly the way that the Buddha handled that. You can handle your unwholesome thoughts in a very wholesome way once you see them. Hello, Amorett. Good to see you, friend.

**Speaker H:** Hello, Demarato. Hello, everybody. Good to see you as well.

**Speaker A:** And I see David or Daniel rather, lurking up there in the corner. All right, let us not then see wholesome and unwholesome in that bag of right and wrong. Let's see wholesome and unwholesome as wholesome when it is being seen. And when it is not being seen correctly, it's back into right and wrong again. And so the big distinction then is going to be wisdom wisely seeing things the way that they are. It is actually quite possible to want things that you don't have wisely. But that's almost never the case. It's almost always the case that when we want something, we want it unwisely and therefore we feel that we would be better off with it. An example of that is in, let us say, many retreats. They'll talk about Mettā and teach the students to say something like, may all beings be happy. That's not possible. And so if you see it from the perspective of right and wrong, May all beings be happy. Oh, no, it's terrible because so few people are happy. You can put it at right and wrong or you can play wisdom is that's not going to happen. So seeing things realistically rather than seeing may all beings be happy is a good thing. See it as an impossibility. That's not real. The question is, while you're saying may all beings be happy, can you be happy yourself right then and there? Can you be happy that. That not all beings are going to be happy? Can you become part of that select few? Can you in fact practice being noble right then and may all beings be happy? Not going to. Many of the beings are just simply not smart enough that in fact, when we're talking about those kind of beings, we're talking about tomcats, lions, snakes, they're just not smart enough. They don't have that frontal cortex to be able to see. But humans are not much different. The teachings of the Buddha are profound. They're subtle. It takes a while for inspection to see and let it sink in. Like imagine the first day of algebra class when the team the blackboard x plus y is equal to 2. Or maybe just x plus x equals 2. And some of the students are going to stay dumb, but some of them are going to recognize, oh, that's just one plus one equals two. Because if X is equal to X, one plus one is equal to two. That's simple. It's simple if you can see it. And the teaching of the Buddha, according to the Buddha, specifically according to the Buddha, to Ananda, is that because the Buddha could see, but Ananda just didn't get it. He attended the Buddha for 25 years. He was the Buddha's attendant. He was very smart, he was sharp. But he missed that basic point. He missed the distinction between right and wrong versus wholesome and unwholesome. It wasn't until after the Buddha died, and I think it was Mahakassapa that wasn't going to let him into the conference because he knew as a noble that Ananda didn't get it. And right before the, the, the conference started, Ananda finally, it dawned on him that one plus one equals two. It finally dawned upon him that I can in fact be wholesome when I see the unwholesome, that it's not a matter of right and wrong, good and bad, up and down. It's a matter of seeing it clearly and making a slight change. So in the style of a noble, if the mind is noble, then we either want things wholesomely or like may all beings be happy. Not possible. Let's just leave it. Or you can want something wholesomely, like you want your friend to be happy and so you can do happy things and cheer them up. But if you can't cheer them up and they won't be happy, are you going to lose your happiness? Oh, poor me, I couldn't make him happy. Are you just going to maintain your happiness? Amrit, you got your hand up. Go right ahead, my friend.

**Speaker H:** Yeah, One question. So the teachings of Buddha are subtle and not very easy to see, at least for beginners. And is it also because maybe Mara is actively deluding us?

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And what is Mara? Define parasmara.

**Speaker H:** So part of the brain just doesn't want us to see what's happening and it's kind of hiding things away and trying to keep distracting us.

**Speaker A:** But there's nothing out there that's trying to defeat you in such a way that in fact it is. Mara is ignorance. Mara is blind to the unwholesome. Mara continues to keep your own mind caught between right and wrong in that duality where seeing the unwholesome is a very wholesome thing to do. So Mara is based in ignorance. Now, when one is not ignorant, when one is does not want anything, when one is completely satisfied, the likelihood of him killing somebody to get it is very, very low. If you don't want anything, you're very unlikely to steal it. If you don't want anything and you're completely satisfied and everything is good, it's unlikely you're going to tell a lie. That in fact, the way that I'm speaking now is the way that the precepts were introduced by the Buddha in the majta nikya number 117, the great 40. It was never designed by the Buddha to be precepts, but rather he talked about right Noble action is the actions that we will take when the mind is pure, when we don't want anything or don't want much. An example of that is that the Arahant, he goes to the toilet. If he doesn't, he'll mess himself in the pants. And he knows it. So he goes to the toilet. Another one, which I mentioned to Mikey the other day is how many of you on YouTube have seen videos of mongooses versus cobra. Have you seen one of those movies? They're on regular on YouTube. So when you think about a mongoose and a cobra having a spat, which one would you normally vote for? What's your instinct tell you? Right, Karwan, you're going to vote for the snake. You're going to vote for the snake. That's very interesting. Most people don't vote for the snake. They vote for the mongoose. Why? Because evolutionary, we're closer to being a mongoose than we are to being a cobra. Not only, but as a. An instinct. Humans have it built into their DNA to avoid and hate snakes. It's part of our DNA. So tell me, Karwan, what was your justification for voting for the cobra?

**Speaker I:** I'm not ready. It was just an answer. To be honest, I did not talk much about it.

**Speaker A:** Oh, you were just doing your hand like a snake, huh? Yeah.

**Speaker I:** It was not a smart answer in any way. Just. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right. Okay. So the Arahant is going to know that he has the instinct to vote for the. The mongoose over the cobra, but it does not affect him. He does not put down money in a bet. He does not try to interfere. He doesn't do anything other than recognize that instinctually we would rather vote for the mongoose than the snake. But really, what are we going to feel when one or the other of them wins? They may both kill each other. That happens often. Are we going to feel bad because they kill each other? Are we going to be happy because the mongoose wins and the snake dies? Or how about the mongoose wins and the snake just crawls away because he don't want to fight? So this idea then of being noble is not that we completely eliminate our instincts, but what we do is we have great control over them. And in that regard, we have great control over our behavior as nobles. If we don't get involved, we don't go join a team, we don't go off to war, we don't act patriotic or any of that kind of stuff then. In fact, this is something very interesting about Thailand, that the Thai monks are taught that they are above society, but they're better than society. They're better than the teachers, they're better than the princes. They're better than everybody in the country except for one, and that's the king. But that was when Bhumi Paul was the king. Now I'm not so sure. So that that's the whole point is, can you be above it? Can you be above the fray? Can you be above the. The mongoose and the snake? Can you remember to practice being noble? Can you remember that it's better right here and now to not want anything, that you're okay without anything? You're already okay. You Got everything you need? The only thing you need really is the next breath. And one of these days you're not going to even get that. Can you be okay without getting the next breath? So who had their hand up? Dietrich, did you have your hand up?

**Speaker J:** Yeah, I had, I had. No, I just. Because once you said if you don't want anything, they're not likely to steal it. I like that very much. And I have a different version of that around the other way around. You never have enough of what you don't need.

**Speaker A:** You never have enough of what you don't need.

**Speaker J:** That's why people always want more. More money stuff.

**Speaker A:** Or the other way of saying it is that you've always got way too much of the stuff you don't want.

**Speaker J:** Yeah, like that one, too.

**Speaker A:** So if you don't want anything and don't want to get rid of anything, then you're just noble. That's what the whole quality of nobility is, is that you have come to rest. Another way of saying it is the job that needed to be done has now been done. That's actually in the suttas, along with things like pure is a polished shell. Don't need anything. I've heard the expression good to go. Well, an arahant is good to not go. And he's not even good because he's giving up good and bad. He's just. There it is. That's it. Tattata. So that's what the Buddha actually referred to himself as, the Tathagata. Now that's almost always been translated as thus gone one, which makes really misses the point, because tathata is normally translated into English with a very, very old word that we don't use in any place anymore, and that is called thus. A better word would be this. This is it would be the kind of language that we would use. Aha. This is it. This is it. That means reality in the moment. So the Buddha is the one who is in the present moment. He's come to the present moment because the present moment is always here. Why would they translate that as the one who is gone to the present moment? I guess it's being translated that way by someone who is not in the present moment. And the Buddha is gone to the present moment. So his name is Tathagata. So that means then that it's your. Let us say your job to do is to get into the present moment. And when you're in the present moment, the job that needed to be done has been done. When you've come into a Wholesome thought. The job that needed to be done has been done. Here you are. This is it. So that's basically the state of a noble is one who does not need anything. In fact, a noble is so satisfied, he doesn't even need enlightenment. He doesn't need nibbana. But all of these Western Buddhists have said what you're supposed to. Hunger and thirst and lust after enlightenment. But a noble doesn't thirst for anything. He's already okay, so he doesn't need to be enlightened. In fact, he's already light enough. If he was any lighter than he is, he'd float right off into thin air. Ivan, go ahead.

**Speaker D:** Yeah, Yeah, I just. I realized the practice here is interesting because, you know, the less I need every time it comes out and I don't give it much attention, the more better I feel, actually. It's actually the delusion that I have been. Have conditioned for so many years, thinking, I need this, I need that. It's what kept me stuck and thinking I'm not okay. It's pretty ironic.

**Speaker A:** But we were trained that way. That's the way we were trained. That's what our society requires of us, is to be in a state of need for the society itself and for the things of society. But when the mind is noble and you don't want anything, you don't need anything, then you don't interact so much with society, very little or if anything at all. And so this is why we can go to that point of the kind of actions that you take bring you to no action at all, brings you to not acting in a good way, not acting in a bad way, just not acting much of anything. That's why the Arahats won't have much to say to each other. All they do is smile. So does anybody have anything to say now? Gosh, we've got so many. Martin, how about you?

**Speaker F:** Thank you very much. Damarato. It's more clearer now. I'm on a good track, I think.

**Speaker A:** Good if you got some Dhamma out of it. If you stopped knowing stuff and just are okay and happy that you know what you know and everything is cool. That's success. Fake it till you make it.

**Speaker F:** All right.

**Speaker A:** All right. Karwan, how about you? Have something to say?

**Speaker I:** Not really, but I just really liked a lot today the difference between right and wrong versus wholesome and unwholesome. I'm not getting it, but, yeah, it's good for me to look more into that. Yeah. So thank you for that.

**Speaker A:** All right. How about you, Dietary?

**Speaker J:** I thought it was really inspirational.

**Speaker G:** Again.

**Speaker J:** When I join, I always end up having another insight again, so. So thank you for that. And also thank you, everybody, for last year. It's been really cool.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's a good point. Thank you all for having been here this year. Thank you for those who joined later. Thank you for those who have done so many of these talks. Not right here, right now. That's okay. If you ever see this video, recognize that I have gratitude for your entertainment. So, Santiago, do you have any last remarks?

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** How about you, Chris? Yes, Chris.

**Speaker C:** Now, I've talked enough today.

**Speaker A:** How about you, Ben?

**Speaker D:** Not much to say, but thank you, Demarato?

**Speaker A:** All's good. All right. How about you, Carl? How about you, Amrit?

**Speaker H:** Thank you, Dhammalato. I also have nothing to say. Just a smile.

**Speaker A:** All right? Just a smile. Okay. So, Mikey, why don't you take this thing home?

**Speaker E:** Sure. On the topic of wholesome and unwholesome and good and bad, one way to look at it is that what is unwholesome is a lie. It's not true. What is wholesome is the truth. And the truth is you're good enough right now. If you can recognize that, that's great, but we don't need to see it as good or bad. You know, you don't need to see it as like, oh, I've been lying to myself my whole life. I'm such a bad person. There doesn't need to be any sort of judgment there. If anything, there can be celebration that.

**Speaker A:** Oh, now you see the truth. Those lies. I could see those lies.

**Speaker J:** Yay.

**Speaker E:** You're. You're already whole. So have a happy, wholesome new year. And, yeah, thank you, friends, for being here. Go check out opensongafoundation.org we've still been investing some time into it and playing with it. On the development side, check out the menu and click Community. And there's a groups page. And we've had people been posting there in our groups. It's kind of like a Facebook group. So go there, interact with each other and play around with the website. Yeah. Thank you all. Take care. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** I remember Pedro. Pedro, do you have something to say? I remember Pedro was involved in OSF right from the very beginning, and then he disappeared for a year or so.

**Speaker D:** He said he couldn't speak.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker D:** He said I couldn't speak.

**Speaker A:** All right.

**Speaker H:** Yes, I've been here in the background. So thank you so much, everybody, Damarato, for the talk of today. Let's go to open Sangha foundation and see the community and so on. And good practice for everyone in the new year. See you next week.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Go. Go see. Go meet some nobles. Go say hi. Give them a smiley face. So thank you Al so much. This has been a great moment. And may you have a delicious 25. May be filled with smiles. May. May you practice well. May you fake it until you make it. Bye.
