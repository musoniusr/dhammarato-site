### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Yes, so I recently read, I don't remember if it's in the suttas or if it's in Anicca's book, but I read that the Buddha actually, it took quite some time for the Buddha to accept his own auntie as an Arahant and part of the Sangha, and that it took Ananda's request for several times for the Buddha to accept his auntie and the women in general. As part of the Sangha. And I was wondering why. And then I was also wondering what was the role of the women in the Sangha?

**Speaker B:** Okay. Okay. So, let's start with the story and the foundation of the story. With women not being allowed into the Sangha until the Buddha gave finally permission. Now, to start off with, Ananda had to ask him 3 times, and that has actually become a tradition, that the Master has to be asked 3 times before he will say yes, because in that period of time, some things can happen. All right, the second point which drives this home even further was, is that it was his aunt, as you said, except that she was the sister of, uh, Buddha's mother, naturally being an aunt. But his mother died within a week of his birth. Which meant that his actual mother, the one who raised him, was this aunt. So that even brings it even closer. Okay, an aunt is an aunt in America. Oh, she lives in Chicago or something like that. The reality is, is that no, this is really close to family. Then in fact, the other side of it was, is that Ananda was her natural child. Which made then the Buddha and the Nanda half-brothers, except that they were also cousins, etc., and that both the sisters were married to— I think his name is Sukkha Dhamma, the king at the time. And so that's the background of this, and that the Buddha did not have Ananda as an attendant until 25 years after he was teaching, that Ananda was there only for the last 20 years of the Buddha's life. And the reason for that is because of all the, let us say, family duties that Ananda attended to. And then after that was he went to live with the monks. Now, the second part of it has to do with the background then, as to why the Buddha would have been so reluctant, and the answer to that is not only complicated, but you can still see the results of it today, in both the way that it's worked within Buddhism, and also in nature, that the Buddha was actually addressing a natural problem, and that is the distinction between the sexes. Now, the Buddha was raised in a Brahmin, Rishi, recluse, wanderer tradition, that the wanderers or the spiritual seekers are out on their own, they're travelers, they're pilgrims, they're going around someplace. And for that reason, it's done singly. But that was more culture than anything else. But you can see that culture running wild, even in modern culture, that a meditation teacher who is married doesn't quite have the status of one who is single for one reason or another. And so, basically, it's for safety. That because also in that time, and still in many other cultures and traditions even today, is that women are property. And that the monks then were actually being free from property as well. As their sensual desires. Now, I have to introduce an idea, so let's start with the example of someone who is on a diet. We could also do smokers. Let's do smokers, OK? The easiest way for a smoker to quit smoking is to not have any smoking equipment equipment around. He throws it out. He gets rid of his last cigarettes. He washes them down the toilet or something. And now he's done with it. So when that strong craving and desire for a cigarette comes, it's not going to be easily satisfied with the cigarettes that he kept in the drawer. He's going to have to go shopping. And if he's smart enough, shopping is 30 miles away, which even further deteriorates the idea of going. Maybe I can put up with and do what I wanted to do rather than succumb to my feelings right now. Okay, so if we can see that with tobacco, we can see it with the diet. Don't have the donuts in the house when you're on a diet. And so, uh, okay, so not having women around also makes sense for the men But the women hear that, and I imagine the donuts would feel the same way of women if you can't have them at home. So, it works the other way around though, because in fact the Buddha was able to do that. That in fact what he set up with the Bhikkhunis was absolutely brand new, because there was no other tradition in India specifically for women at the time. That all of the old rishis, all the yogis, all of that kind of stuff were all men anyway. And that you can see that even in our culture, even on our little Sangha groups that we have on Sunday, that the men generally outnumber the women. Why is that? Partly because men are hungry, they're built that way. They've got extra things that they've got to deal with, to where women have a quality of home and being at home and nurturing and family and all of that. And so, by our very nature, women provide something that men need. And the whole idea then is to get men out of needing things, to get them healthy mentally. And so, keeping away from the women is a good idea, but in the same regard, whether it's whether it's a specific item of ordination or whether it's full ordination, and I'm making the difference between here and Thailand, is that they have various levels of women ordinates and what precepts that they take. And then there is the Bhikkhuni, which actually has, at least in the The tradition is that the woman who is a Bhikkhuni has the same stature, the status, and all of that kind of stuff that the monk does. And yet, in Thai tradition, that's still not the same thing. Now here's something that's very interesting that a lot of people don't understand, and that is that Thailand because of Buddhism, I think, is actually matriarchal. And because of that, the women have a great deal of power. And so they don't have to, like in the Western culture, women are intentionally deprived of power. Where in Thailand, the women have the power. So in the West, power and status come kind of together. But in Thailand, the power is given to the women and the men can get the status, but the women, you know, the power behind the throne sort of thing.

**Speaker A:** Um, and in Thailand— sorry, in Thailand, are there some, uh, Bhikkhuni's orders? Because I— well, I think I read something that, uh like it depended on the countries.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that's correct. You're making a point, and that is that the Bhikkhuni order was more or less destroyed, just like the Bhikkhu Sangha was destroyed in India. But enough of them escaped that time period, and that was in fact what spread Buddhism all over the place. But in Thailand It actually came in two waves, and in either case, the Bhikkhuni order didn't make it to Thailand, but it did make it to both Vietnam and China, and by that, on to Taiwan. So now Taiwan is actually the place in the world where they have their lineage traced right back to the Buddha. And not only that, but the Bhikkhunis in Taiwan outnumber the monks. There's more Bhikkhunis in Taiwan, so it seems like that's the place to go. So when it happened in Thailand, I mean, this was something that was going on in the 1990s. Feminism caught up with Thailand, looking for the status rather than the power. So women are not equal to men until we revive the Bhikkhunihood. So find the Thai monks and a very important Meiji went to Taiwan for the ordination, and they ordained her and several other Thai women, and I think there was an Arahant that was in that group. And then later, they go and do the same thing for Sri Lanka. Now here's the kind of strange issue, but it's an issue for both men and women. And that is that it takes a preceptor 20 years to become an Arhat before he can either be the abbot of a temple or to become the Upajaya for an ordination. And that's true for the women also. But now we've had women ordained for 20 years so that we don't need to go to Taiwan or whatever to do it, that we've actually got the Bhikkhuni order now fully established in Thailand, and fully established actually in the West through the Achan Chah tradition, the Bhikkhuni that was at, I think, Amaravati for such a long time, now has her own establishment in Southern California someplace. So the Bhikkhuni system is reestablished, and I think that it's necessary for that to happen for Buddhism to spread correctly in the West because of the mind state. But in Thailand, they have a different mindset. It's like they don't care that the women get what they want already anyway, and so let's go have the ceremony and make the big dude do all the work of being important, and then the women can take care of running the place. And that's the way that it is. In fact, at Wat Sooan Monk, there's a huge, huge Meiji area. Part of the reason that that's there like that, and in many other wats in Asia, is that the young man who goes to the wat, ordains and stays a monk for 5 years or 10 years or something, and then disrobes for whatever reason. And then goes to his family and gets into their business after he's got 5 or 10 years as a monk. He's a pretty sharp dude now. He can see things clearly, right, rather than superstitiously or just stupidly. And so he winds up getting the family prosperous. So by the time he's about 55 or 60, time for retirement, he will give that business over to his family and he and his wife will go trotting off to the wat, and each one of them will build a kuti, one in the women's section for the wife and one in the back that wants to go and milk. In fact, that's part of the reason why there are so many old wooden rundown kutis there, is because they were built for men to retire in as monks. And that also shows that women by the hundreds of thousands in Thailand take on this state called Meechi. Now, there are various different forms. One is whether they shave their head or not. Another one is, do they wear white and then dark or black below, or whether they dress fully in white? And that has to do with the level of the precepts that they're taking. In fact, a woman who is fully in white and also a shaved head is more than likely a 10 preceptor. And she doesn't handle money, just like the monks don't. But there are other women that— in fact, at Wat Soan Mokkh, when I was there, there was a very, very famous mei chi, Achan Ratchawan, and she was— she had hair and she had a black skirt, but she was responsible for many, many things there, and she had a huge following, and she spoke enough English that she would talk to the Westerners there also. But one of the qualities that is most remembered by her is that she had connections into the Oriental Hotel in Bangkok, which was then known as the 5-star hotel. I think that they invented 5 stars just for the Oriental back in the 1960s and whatnot. And what Ajaan Wanchaiwan did was she would bring some of the staff down to Wat Soan Mokkh and give them training in Dhamma, and then the staff would go back and apply that— the generosity and the graciousness and the high-quality attitude.

**Speaker A:** Oh really?

**Speaker B:** Yes. And that's what made this hotel a 5-star hotel, was the quality of the staff.

**Speaker A:** Interesting.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so that's just a side story. Let's get back to The fact that the Bhikkhunis have been established all along. The only issue is that, except for the original, his aunt, she was the only Bhikkhuni that was not ordained by a Bhikkhuni. After she, she was then in charge of the ordination. They would have actually, she would be the Arahant. Involved with it, because the tradition is that the Upajaya has to be at least 20 years a monk, but better still, 40. The Maha Thera, the ones who've been a monk for 40 years. Okay, so he's the one that has changed to that. But the Achan generally only has been required for being a monk 10 years, and then they can take on a student. So that was kind of short-circuited at the very, very beginning, but eventually quite well established so that it actually requires both monks and nuns to do ordination for Bhikkhuni until they get enough Bhikkhunis with enough of the status, and then the Bhikkhunis can do it all by themselves. And we've already reached that level. So that means that the women don't need the men anymore at all. Now there's an interesting point about that too, and that is that there's still the old boys' club and the hierarchy and the snobbery and the racism and bigotry that still exist in the hearts of men. And so that whole show still existed just like it did in the time of the Buddha. And so I know because I've got a friend here in Thailand, he and I have had this kind of argument before where he takes the perspective that's kind of different than I do. I take the perspective of, yeehaw, the women are actually on the way. They've got it going now. And Robert will come back in with, "Yes, but look how far they've got to go," because they've got resistance at the Council, they've got resistance with the lay people, they've got all kinds of stuff going on. And that's true, it's still got some resistance here in— actually, wherever the Bhikkhunis go, there is no really safe home for Bhikkhunis, except in Taiwan. For some reason, it was kept there, but it was also part of Chinese. But as you'll know, by the time that Mao came, what was left of Buddhism was destroyed in China. So, it was left to the island of Taiwan. Lucky enough, I mean, that's kind of like having a school bus headed down a ravine with no brakes, and all of a sudden it just kind of stops there before right before the bus crashes. And that seems to have been what happened with the Bhikkhunihood, is that the only place they had left was Taiwan. But it was because of the Taiwan nuns that have revived it, and now it's alive and well in Sri Lanka for sure, I know. I'm not sure about Burma. I don't think so in Cambodia. But it is alive. It's growing. There's several temples here in Thailand now that are dedicated to the women, all of them.

**Speaker A:** Yes, in Sri Lanka there is a Bhikkhuni order.

**Speaker B:** Um, let us say this, at least this much: I know personally of 3 Bhikkhunis who ordained in Sri Makkha, so they've got to have something going there. Okay, there is actually a, um, a Bhavana in, of all places, Greensboro, South Carolina, that has two full, fully ordained Bhikkhunis. Or at least that was true in 2008, and I imagine that's still about the same. And it supports a, uh, Sri Lankan community in Greenville, South Carolina. And somebody in that community, I know for sure, I've read whatever kind of fancy car it was, somebody in that community's got money. And so that Bhikkhuni, uh, place will probably still be in existence. But that's just the fact that, you know, little things are growing, little sprouts. I mean, Johnny Appleseed has been in town, and now the Bhikkhuni order is growing. And so, the question then, for all of the people who are in a hurry, is, "Why don't you hurry up?" The answer to that is, is that things take their own time. And so, instead of worrying about why was the Buddha so reluctant, actually the reluctance that he had to it was, look at all the logistical problems that are occurring because of the instinct of humans on top of all the Indian society at the time, was not only is he establishing two orders, they can't really mingle, they've got to stay apart. You've got to have a place for the Bhikkhunis, and you've got to have people who are willing to support them, when they've already got the idea that is for monks. Now, this is in fact one point about the Catholics, that they didn't do this. They had— they did it somewhat, but they wound up with nuns and monks too close together. But if they're completely separated, then, you know, by a couple of kilometers at least, then things are better off. Also, In the Vinaya, there are certain rules about locations and things like that, and that the women have exactly those same rules the Bhikkhunis do. But I understand that the Bhikkhunis have 12 additional rules, but I can say for sure that those were added later, that that was not something that the Buddha required. At the time of the Buddha, it was with the robe and bowl, "Come, Anicca, come." And so, the reluctance had to do again with the fact that he's got to find food, clothing, housing, a backup, and a completely separate system. And now actually, we've actually re-established that, and so we do have that complete separate system. But it will always be smaller, that for some reason, many women, in fact, you could say, are content, or see that it's too much work, or too much bother to go ordain, and so they don't do it so much. So I would say the number of monks versus the number in Thailand would be about 3 to 1. That's why actually Taiwan is so surprising, is because their nuns actually outnumber the monks. So does anybody have any questions about this? I could go on and on about it, but I think that we've got enough. What do you think, Anna?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, thank you. Thank you for your response.

**Speaker B:** And.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, thank you.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that in fact one of the important points is that women have just as much chance of becoming happy humans as men do.

**Speaker A:** Yes, of course.

**Speaker B:** Yes, of course they do. That's the whole point of it. And yet in the old chauvinistic tradition, they have it that women have to be reborn as a man before they can become enlightened. Have you ever heard anything like that? Any of you have you heard that?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I think I've heard that in the Indian tradition and stuff like that. No.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, guess what? It's true. Okay, but it's true in a non-magical way. It's true in the sense that you've got to get your mojo, you've got to get your confidence, you've got to get your lion, or in the case of the women, the lioness. They've got to get that roar Okay, the power of the knowledge that you're successful.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points discussed:

**Main Topic:** The historical and cultural reasons for the Buddha's initial reluctance to ordain women as *bhikkhunis* (fully ordained nuns), the subsequent establishment of the Bhikkhuni Sangha, and its modern revival.

### Key Points:

1.  **The Story of Mahapajapati Gotami:**
    *   The Buddha's aunt, Mahapajapati Gotami (who raised him after his mother's death), requested ordination multiple times.
    *   Ananda, her son and the Buddha's cousin, intervened and asked the Buddha three times before he agreed, establishing a tradition of asking three times for major requests.
    *   The Buddha's reluctance is framed not as misogyny, but as a pragmatic concern about the logistical and social challenges of integrating a female monastic order into the existing male-dominated, wandering ascetic culture.

2.  **Reasons for Initial Reluctance:**
    *   **Cultural & Safety Context:** In that era, women were often seen as property, and monks were renouncing worldly attachments, including sensual desires. Keeping the sexes separate was seen as a practical support for celibacy and mental focus, akin to removing temptations (like cigarettes or donuts) from one's environment.
    *   **Logistical Burden:** Establishing a separate, parallel monastic system for women required separate housing, support networks, and rules to ensure safety and propriety, which was a significant new undertaking.
    *   **Natural & Social Dynamics:** The speaker suggests men, by nature, are more prone to "hunger" and distraction, and the monastic path was designed to help them overcome these tendencies. Creating a separate order protected the integrity of both communities.

3.  **Establishment and Legacy of the Bhikkhuni Order:**
    *   The Buddha's acceptance was revolutionary, creating the first female monastic order in India.
    *   The full Bhikkhuni ordination lineage requires both monks and nuns. After Mahapajapati, the order became self-sustaining.
    *   The lineage was preserved and flourished primarily in Taiwan, where *bhikkhunis* now outnumber monks. It was lost in places like Thailand but has been revived in modern times.

4.  **Modern Revival and Cultural Differences:**
    *   **Thailand:** Traditionally, the full Bhikkhuni lineage did not survive. Thai society is described as functionally **matriarchal**, where women hold significant social and economic power ("the power behind the throne"). Many women become *mae chi* (lay nuns following 8-10 precepts) instead of seeking full ordination. In recent decades, influenced by feminism, some Thai women have sought full ordination abroad (e.g., in Taiwan) to re-establish the lineage in Thailand.
    *   **The West & Sri Lanka:** The Bhikkhuni order has been successfully re-established in Sri Lanka and in some Western Buddhist communities (e.g., the U.S., UK), seen as important for Buddhism's adaptation to Western egalitarian values.
    *   **Resistance:** The revival still faces resistance from conservative elements within traditional monastic hierarchies.

5.  **Core Dhamma Perspective:**
    *   The ultimate goal of the path—enlightenment and the end of suffering—is equally accessible to **both men and women**.
    *   The idea that a woman must be reborn as a man to become enlightened is dismissed as a later cultural accretion, not the Buddha's core teaching. The real requirement is developing confidence, wisdom, and mental mastery, regardless of gender.

**Overall Tone:** The talk provides a historical and sociological explanation for the Buddha's cautious approach, emphasizing practical challenges over prejudice. It concludes on an optimistic note, celebrating the revival of the Bhikkhuni Sangha as a fulfillment of the Dhamma's universal potential.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **The Smoker/Dieter Metaphor:** Used to explain why the Buddha might have initially been reluctant to admit women into the Sangha. Just as a smoker quits more easily by removing all cigarettes from the house, or a dieter by not keeping donuts at home, monks could better focus on overcoming sensual desires and attachments by not having women nearby. This frames the monastic separation as a practical support for practice, not a judgment on women.
2.  **The "Power behind the Throne":** Used to describe the social structure in Thailand, where women are seen to hold real, practical power (running families and businesses), while men may hold formal status (like in the monkhood). This contrasts with Western notions where status and power are more directly linked.
3.  **Johnny Appleseed:** Used to describe the gradual, organic regrowth of the Bhikkhuni (nuns') order around the world. It suggests someone (or the collective effort of many) has been planting seeds that are now sprouting in various places, emphasizing natural growth over forced change.
4.  **The School Bus Headed Down a Ravine:** A vivid metaphor for the precarious state of the Bhikkhuni lineage as it was nearly destroyed. Taiwan is depicted as the point where the bus "just kind of stops... before it crashes," representing the survival and preservation of the full ordination lineage for women there.
5.  **Getting Your Mojo / The Lion's Roar:** Used to reinterpret the idea that women must be reborn as men to become enlightened. It's reframed not as a literal rebirth, but as a metaphor for gaining confidence, authority, and the "roar" of self-assured knowledge—qualities one must develop regardless of gender.

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **The Story of Mahapajapati Gotami:** The central historical story of the Buddha's aunt (and foster mother) requesting ordination. The talk elaborates on its significance: Ananda had to ask three times (establishing a tradition), and it involved the Buddha's closest family (his foster mother and her son, his cousin/half-brother Ananda).
2.  **The Revival of the Bhikkhuni Order:** A modern narrative about how the lineage was revived. The story traces its near-destruction in India, survival in Taiwan, and its modern re-establishment in Thailand, Sri Lanka, and the West through efforts like Thai monks and nuns traveling to Taiwan for ordination in the 1990s.
3.  **The Achan Ratchawan Story:** An anecdote about a famous *mae chi* (white-robed nun) at Wat Suan Mokkh in Thailand. She is noted for training staff from Bangkok's luxurious Oriental Hotel in Dhamma principles, which the speaker credits with helping make it a world-class, "5-star" hotel through the staff's graciousness and quality of service. This story illustrates the practical, societal impact of female practitioners outside formal monastic structures.
4.  **The Retirement Pattern at Thai Wats:** A descriptive story about a common life pattern in Thailand: a man ordains as a monk for a period, then disrobes to run a family business successfully, and finally retires with his wife to a monastery—he as a monk, she often as a *mae chi*. This story explains the abundance of living quarters (*kutis*) at monasteries and highlights a common, respected path for women's practice later in life.
5.  **The "Old Boys' Club" Resistance:** A contemporary story, framed as a recurring argument between the speaker and a friend named Robert. Robert represents the perspective that focuses on the ongoing institutional resistance to fully recognized Bhikkhunis, while the speaker celebrates the progress made. This story highlights the ongoing social and hierarchical struggles within Buddhist communities.

These metaphors and stories work together to explain historical context, justify practical monastic rules, illustrate cultural differences (Thailand vs. West), chart the revival of the nuns' order, and ultimately argue for the equal spiritual potential of women and men.
