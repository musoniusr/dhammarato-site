### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, yeah, I have like some, some multiple questions.

**Speaker B:** Uh, right, yeah. So let's finish this point off. Is there some place deep in our DNA is buried— and never mind whether it's deep or not, but it's actually in the DNA— that we have a reaction to snakes, which means we will react to sticks on the ground or a belt on the floor, because it reminds us of the image of a snake. But also, that comes from the fear of the unknown. That in fact, think about reptiles and storks, that if the stork sees a young crocodile, that crocodile is lunch. But if that crocodile sees a stork, then the stork is lunch. Whoever sees what first, right? And so we have a built-in reaction to seeing things that startle us, because out in the jungle, it might be dangerous, it's sneaking up on you. And so it's better to see an Arahant prowling in the grass, rather than seeing the lion charging you. True. All right. So this then gives rise to that issue of familiarity, which is where we started. All right. And the familiar then means that we know it and we recognize it easily and we know how to deal with it in a way. Because it is familiar. And so an example of that I've heard recently is that people will pretend to go to sleep, then they will go to sleep.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. And then— and just if you are.

**Speaker B:** Up and awake and worried about going to sleep and thinking about things, then you don't go to sleep. But if you pretend to go to sleep, then you actually go to sleep. All right, so things start as a seed. Go ahead.

**Speaker A:** So the familiar, the familiar thing here is then the, the, the unwholesome thoughts. And like, this is why you're— this is why I can't bring myself to change them, because they are familiar.

**Speaker B:** They're familiar. We've got a habit of it. That we've gotten used to being in a certain way. We form those habits when we were children. Most people feel as adults the way that they felt at the age of 3 and 4. And at the age of 5 and 6, we're put to work. We have to do what we're told to do, whether we like it. And so we go around living lives of quiet desperation, doing what we're told to do. To feeling the way that we felt, not liking it but doing it anyway. I mean, it's very, very typical, very classic, well known that people don't like their jobs, right? Very few people like it. Well, if they don't like the job, why do they have it? Why do they keep it?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, because it's familiar.

**Speaker B:** It's because it's familiar and they feel uncomfortable and insecure if they have no job. Right. And they, and they have the idea if you don't work, you don't eat, right? But that's a lie. Almost everybody that I know that doesn't work eats.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, true, true.

**Speaker B:** They find a way of getting something to eat. If you don't feed a dog, he'll go find something to eat. Oh, children don't work, they eat. A lot of wives don't have jobs and they eat. A lot of husbands don't have jobs and they eat. But that's grilled into us by those people who want to take advantage of us, and often it's our own dad. Dad wants the teenage boy to go get a job, and so he goes to someone who is just like his dad that wants him to get a job. You know why dad wants the kid to get a job? Because it benefits the dad. My dad would call me lazy because I didn't cut the grass. And I didn't like it being called lazy, so I went and cut the grass, but I didn't like doing it. It took me a long time to realize that it was he who was being lazy, because he wanted the grass cut, but he wanted me to do it. If he wanted the grass cut, why didn't he cut the grass? If dad wants the kid to clean up his room, why don't dad clean up the room? He wants the room cleaned up, why does he want the kid to do it? Then in fact, a better way to do it would be, if a dad had wisdom, he'd make a game out of it. Maybe a basketball game: here, let me hold this great big bag that you keep your toys in, and I'm going to try to keep you from getting it in the bag, and let's make a game out of it. And everybody has fun while the room's getting cleaned up. But oh no, it's, "You go clean up your room so I feel better," or, "You go get a job so I don't have to support you so much," or, "If you get a job working at this factory, I'm going to make some money off of you." I mean, how many factory managers hire people just for the fun of it? They're not expecting to make any money off of you. They may make just enough of money off of you to pay you, and then they're not in any benefit. But that's the mentality of Thailand, by the way. They have a whole mentality, it's a culture mentality of full employment. Anybody who wants a job can get a job. And one of the funniest parts, that you're over on Koh Samui, have you ever ridden down the road and see people who work for the hotel come out and direct traffic?

**Speaker A:** I have, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, guess what? Those guys are completely worthless, they're completely useless. People can come out of the hotel driving their cars, they don't need somebody to come out and stand in traffic.

**Speaker A:** But they need to give somebody a job.

**Speaker B:** But they need to give somebody a job, exactly. Okay, so going back to that point that you were making before about, uh, you, you've heard it, make, uh, fake it till you make it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** All right, there's two ways of doing that. One is to just be a charlatan until you're a good charlatan.

**Speaker A:** I don't know what a charlatan is.

**Speaker B:** But a thief, a huckster, a street musician, a magician, a three-part Bhante. Okay, a charlatan is one who is using prestidigitation or sleight of hand or lying to get you to do something. Gambling is that way. That's what most gambling is all about. Okay, they promise you something good and you go for it and you wind up disappointed, whether it's a gambling or whether it's a job that you've got or whatever it is. Okay, so that's the faking until you don't make it. But there is the possibility of using that point, and that is his enlightenment, is very much you keep acting enlightened and then you are. You keep having the thought that you're okay, and you are.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's— yeah.

**Speaker B:** But we already have gotten into the habit of, oh, I've got to get this, that, and the other thing, and then I'll be okay, rather than reminding ourselves you're already okay. You don't have to do anything to become okay. You're already okay. So those seeds of thoughts of 'I'm okay' will grow into the full-blown bush of 'I'm okay.'.

**Speaker A:** And it becomes easier over time.

**Speaker B:** And it becomes easier over time because you're developing skill. Yeah, just like a 4-year-old has trouble learning chopsticks, but if he keeps at that piano and practices 30 minutes or an hour every day By the time he's 15, he's in a band. Yeah, true. And so go ahead.

**Speaker A:** This kind of leads into the next topic that I want to discuss, is like, how do you consistently practice in an ever-changing life? Because there was a moment that I was working from my office in Amsterdam, and then it's just like, okay, you recommended me to do 5 minutes, 2 times 5 minutes of practice every hour, and then I would do like this Pomodoro technique of, okay, I'm working 25 minutes and then 5 minutes I'm just gonna lay on the beanbag and like gladden myself and feel good, which I must say was amazing because like I don't think an hour walk would have made me feel as good as just gladdening myself for 5 minutes. So I felt like it boosted my productivity and things like that. But now that I'm kind of moving from place to place, I have these activities that I'm doing, and like some friends are here, and it's become more hectic. How do you still manage to practice consistently?

**Speaker B:** All right. Let me take this opportunity to introduce a sutta, number 39, where the Buddha talks about the Five Hindrances in a way of those Five Hindrances have a result, a before and after. One of them is that you're sick. And then you get well, which means the mind is full of hindrances making you sick, and then you don't have the sicknesses and you feel well. Another one is you're in debt. If you owe somebody something, you probably have to have a job in order to keep making payments. But if you don't owe anybody anything, wow, what a relief that is. All right, so there you are out traveling with the idea that you owe. You got to be there on time. You got to keep track of your bags. True, right? You can't— yeah, you're in an unfamiliar place and you got to be on your toes. There's another aspect of that. In fact, the Buddha, uh, besides those two that I gave you of owing money and, uh, being sick, he also has prison But the one that I'm mentioning here is because he's actually talked about what you're talking about, and that is that someone is on a journey. Now, in those days with the Silk Road, the actual example is that somebody has his camels loaded down with treasure crossing the desert, and when he gets to the oasis, or better still, he gets home he can relax. All right? Which means that when we're out traveling, we feel that we're in an uncomfortable environment, we got to keep track, we owe a whole lot of things, and when we arrive, then we are— especially if we arrive free, without having lost any of our baggage, and we made it safely home. So the example would be that somebody gets home, with their big suitcases, they plop the suitcases down and then they lay on the bed immediately. It's very typical. As soon as you get home from a long journey, you put those bags down, don't even open them, and put the stuff away. No, I'm home and I can just drop those bags and rest. Okay, so you can have that mentality that even if you're at the airport, you can set those bags down, sit down in that chair, and rest. Take it frequently, that even though the journey is not completed, at least it's completed in the sense of where you've gotten to allows you to sit here and rest. So have that mentality that you are finally arrived at home. That's something that happened big with me because I was actually out on a journey. I mean, I went all over India. I went to every guru that I could find. And then I was living in Bodh Gaya and met a monk and he recommended that I go to see Bhikkhu Buddhadasa. So what do I do? Getting to South Thailand cheap because there was no real good public transportation, I bought a bicycle. And I drove a bicycle from Bangkok down to Wat Suwan Mok and beyond. And that when I arrived at Wat Suwan Mok, Achan Po was standing at the gate waiting for me. Oh yeah, because he had been in a truck from Chumphon and saw me on the highway and knew that I was going to watch Suwanmokkha. He just knew it. And so he stood at the gate waiting on me until I arrived. But I didn't know that part of the story. All I knew for a long time was, here he is saying, I've been waiting on you, where have you been? Like it was magic or something. But that gave me the kind of a door opening that I very quickly, almost immediately, felt like Wat Suwanmokk was my home. And I have developed— and I developed that because I had been out traveling for years, even when I was in high school. Couldn't wait to get out of high school so that I could go someplace else. And when I got there, I wanted to go someplace else again. In fact, my whole life had been traveling until I got to watch Suwanmoksha and I developed that feeling of being at home. But that didn't stop my travels, but what it did stop was that longing for getting home, because I already had my home. And now wherever I go, I have to remind myself I'm at home now. I'm at home. I can sit down and relax. There's no place to go and nothing to do, even while out traveling. I know that that's a kind of contradiction in terms, but it does have that quality of fake it till you make it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I do think I understand. I feel like I've been trying to practice, for example, in a taxi. Like, I would be driving in the taxi, thinking just like there's nothing that I have to do. All I have to do is sit here and enjoy this taxi drive until he drops me off where I need to be.

**Speaker B:** Right, exactly. That's a, that's a perfect example right there. It's just, just sit. Or on an airplane, those people who are actually on the airplane, as they board, as it taxis, as it lifts off, as it's flying through the air for hours, everybody is still uptight. And then when it's getting close to land, they get even more uptight, and then they deboard, and now they've got to deal with another airport, etc., like that. And all that time, nobody feels at home. And while you're traveling, there's an awful lot of waiting, and that waiting time you can use. Like, for instance, when you come from Koh Samui over to Koh Phangan, you're on a boat. Relax. Don't get anxious for what you're going to do when you get to your destination. Just relax. I'm at home now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. That was good.

**Speaker B:** So that's the way we develop that feeling or that sense of well-being, the sense of being at home, the sense of being able to relax. And we practice that. And pretty soon we get pretty good at it.

**Speaker A:** Yes, that's true. I do feel like it gets easier if you do it more.

**Speaker B:** We have to practice often. Why? Because we are normally and naturally through our DNA and through our instincts, we're uptight. About the unknown, about the unfamiliar. So we have to actually practice getting over that instinct. Take your mind and intentionally keep telling yourself, everything's okay, everything is fine, it's going to all work out, there's no hurry. And we can develop that feeling, that sense. If everything is all right, everything is fine, no worries, no hurry, nowhere to go, everything is okay. You take that deep breath and just relax. That's what Anapanasati is really all about, is taking that effort to relax.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And then it's just like practicing. I feel like the barrier is at.

**Speaker B:** The.

**Speaker A:** Initial effort of like just doing it. Just like—.

**Speaker B:** It's hard work in the beginning.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Just, I often use the example of the kids, the car won't start, and so they push it down the road. In the old days when we had clutches, you could get it going and then pop the clutch and the engine would start up. Even if the battery was not strong enough to turn it over, there was still enough battery left to spark the spark plugs to fire. And all— but getting that car to start rolling was a lot of effort, right? And when you start pushing it, it'll eventually get on a roll, and then everybody just has to keep their hand on it and walking it. Yeah, all right. And then you can let go until— and right, another example would be that the daddy is pushing his daughter on a swing at the park. All right, it's come to push me off, Daddy. All right, and so he pushes her off. That initial push is work. Getting her going into the swinging is work. But once she comes back on, back and forth, all we need to do is just touch it. Just touch it to keep it swinging. Yeah, okay. So that's how Anapanasati is. It takes work to get it started, but after we get it working, after we get it running, then the effort is easier and easier. Or like the merry-go-round where the kids are sitting on the merry-go-round and a couple of people have to get it going. It's a lot of work to push that thing off and getting it going, but once it's spinning, then everybody can hop on and ride for a while.

**Speaker A:** Okay, and then you just keep the momentum.

**Speaker B:** Then that— then we just put in just the right amount of effort to keep the momentum going. And so if people quit practice, that means to get it started again is going to take effort. Yeah, but if they start getting it going and getting some momentum in their practice so that they're practicing 3, 4 times a day or every time they remember, then it's just really easy. Yeah, because you've already got the momentum built up. But no one practices that way, even though that's the correct way to practice. What people do is they push really hard, they get their momentum going. Then they take a rest, then they stop meditating, then everything, their whole life falls back apart again. Oh, poor me, pity parties and all of that. And now it takes that push, that effort again to get the ball rolling again. So it would be a whole lot easier just to keep pushing it a little bit every day. Keep, keep practicing, keep practicing every day. And then it becomes easy life, not much effort to it. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Interesting. Okay. When we talk about the, like, the 5, you said it was Sutta number 39, I think, like the 5 blockers. I feel like I'm interested in the.

**Speaker B:** 5 examples of what it's like to be free from the hindrances. 5 examples of being free.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** From hindrances.

**Speaker A:** 5 examples from being free from hindrances is I do recognize the feeling that I owe a lot of people things. Like, I don't owe money, but it's just the feeling of, oh, I owe my friend to join them, or, oh, I owe this person to visit them, or I owe my grandmother a call. On her birthday, or all these, all these different types of feelings of like, oh, I have to pay it back or something.

**Speaker B:** Exactly, paying back an old debt, as opposed to calling Granny because it's her birthday and I'm really happy for her. Hi Granny, happy birthday! But oh no, we do it out of a sense of obligation.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Because we've gotten into the habit of everything we do is out of a sense of obligation. We owe it. And so we can begin to practice to do what we do happily rather than doing it because we have to do it, we owe it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** That in fact I mentioned 4 out of those 5. Let me go over them again: getting out of debt, arriving at your destination, getting out of prison, getting free from an illness. And the 5th one ties those things together in the sense of Having no more job to do, you get fired. Most people, when they get fired, they really do go into a bad state. Oh, what's to become of me? Oh, I'll never get a job again. I got fired. Oh, poor me, right? But a better way of thinking about it is, wow, I didn't like that job anyway. What a relief it is. Yeah, but often we have those jobs because we have obligations to pay, right? And so you can see these things all tied up together— debt and working and doing stuff we don't want to do, being out on a journey, never getting home, almost locked up in prison, and feeling the burden of the world on it in the form of sickness. And all of this comes from having unwholesome thoughts. That in fact, the word hindrance has a quality to it in the sense of it hinders us from being happy, it hinders us from being in a good state right now. And so if we can remember, "Hey, I'm not in debt, hey, I'm at home, hey, I'm not on a journey even though I'm traveling, I don't have to have that sense of I'm on a hard trip, like riding in a taxi cab. How hard is that?

**Speaker A:** Very easy.

**Speaker B:** But how many people feel that way when they're in a taxi? Very hot.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, like the feeling of I have to do something while I'm doing this.

**Speaker B:** I have to do something. I can't just rest.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay. And so this feeling of like owing people is just telling yourself like it's just because you don't enjoy doing it for them. So it feels like you owe them.

**Speaker B:** It feels like we owe them because we've already been in the habit of doing what we're told to do. And not getting a good reward out of it. Calling Granny on her birthday is a drudgery because we're in the habit of thinking that it's a drudgery, when in fact it could be a high point of our own day. Give her some joy and she'll give it back. But if you call her out of a sense of obligation, then she's going to buy into it that way. Yeah, you should have called earlier. And so we teach our kids that sense of obligation. We teach our kids that sense of, um, you gotta work to eat, you gotta do it whether you like it or not. Like kids, if a kid— remember for yourself, if you had a choice about going to school, would you have gone to school, or did you do it because you were told to go to school?

**Speaker A:** Absolutely nobody wants to go to school.

**Speaker B:** Nobody. Why is that? Which means that nobody wants to learn anything. But a few people occasionally really enjoy learning. Have some fun at it.

**Speaker A:** Just basically deliberately make everything fun.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, just deliberately make everything fun. And we start by making nothing fun. We stop doing anything and just sit there doing nothing at all, and let's make that fun. If you can't make nothing at all fun, then where is ever you going to find fun?

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Being away from other people, being all alone, nobody's fussing at you, nobody's expecting anything to you, and you can just sit down and relax. Wow. Take a load off.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, true.

**Speaker B:** And so we need to practice that when we've got very little going for us. It's very much like going to a gym. Most of the people who go to the gym, they don't want to start with the 1-kilogram dumbbells and do the reps over and over and over again to build those muscles. They want to go to the big dumbbells and see how strong I am. We see the guys picking up those big heavy dumbbells and we want to pick them up too, but that's not the way you have to start. A good trainer will say, "No, you don't go there. You sit here and you pick up these 1-pound, 1-kilogram dumbbells and you start doing reps." That's how we practice Anapanasati. We give ourselves very light weights, nothing at all, And we repeat it over and over and over again. Hey, I like this. Hey, this is good. Hey, I can do this. Hey, I'm the boss here. I'm the boss of nothing at all. And if I learn to be the boss of nothing at all, then when something happens, I can be the boss of something.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Sounds good.

**Speaker B:** Well, it sounds too easy, doesn't it? Almost.

**Speaker A:** It is, but that's actually another question that I had. Like, for example, the dependent origination sounds like such a complicated word, but when we talked about it in the Sangha, it was very easy. Why such a complicated word for something so easy?

**Speaker B:** One little step at a time. Yeah, yeah, that when we receive input, we mix it with all our garbage and we wind up with garbage instead of the actual reality. But if we keep paying attention to reality, we start dealing with real. And the reality is that we live in a paradise. Why do we keep creating a hell out of it by not liking?

**Speaker A:** It's a strange paradise, but a nice one.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's good enough for sure. For sure, life is good enough that in fact everybody lusts for life. Nobody wants to die. The big general in the army says, okay, we've got a suicide mission, I'm looking for volunteers, and everybody takes a step backward.

**Speaker A:** Which— yeah, it's too good to— the alternative is probably a whole lot more— so, no.

**Speaker B:** Well, Dad, being dead's a whole lot easier than being alive. Being alive is tough when we're trained the wrong way. That's why we have to train ourselves to— being alive is marvelous, is really great. Well, I'm glad I've got another breath to take.

**Speaker A:** I am actually. You should think about it that way.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** I have another question about practice. When sometimes I'm practicing gladdening the mind, and like, is there a moment where you kind of like stop gladdening it and you just sit there? Because I feel like, okay, I'm building up this feeling of like, okay, oh, I'm feeling so good. Oh, this is so nice. Oh, this is amazing. Oh, this is so great. And I do notice that when I'm just laying there, I get like this big smile on my face because I'm enjoying the moment.

**Speaker B:** But is there a moment where— Yes, that's the whole point is that you do arrive, but you don't stay there.

**Speaker A:** But is there a moment where you're like, okay, now Okay, now it's enough. Now I'm not gonna make myself even more happy where I'm just like, oh, I'm so enthusiastic to do, like, to just— super happy being here.

**Speaker B:** It's a really middle path, okay, that we have been trained in our society to move from one extreme to the other, that it's not good to be just in the middle. An example in America: you've either got to be a Democrat or a Republican. If you're an independent, or you're in between, or you don't give a flying rip about politics, you're a pariah. But you got to make a choice here. You can't sit on the fence. There's an old joke, by the way, and that is, during the Civil War in the United States, the blue against the gray. And so the guy says, well, I'm going to try it both ways. And he put on gray pants and a blue uniform coat. And guess what? He became a target from both sides. So the Northerners shot his butt off and the Rebs shot him in the chest. So that's the way that we look at things. Also, if you're at an extreme and you look at the other extreme and you see somebody in the middle, they actually do look like they're on the other side. There are the— you— the people in the middle appear from a distance to be at that further distance. Yeah. And so if you're at the right and looking left, anything in the middle looks pretty left to you. And if you're on the left and you look right, anything in the middle looks pretty right to you. Okay, so this is a— this middle ground is not well understood. But what we want to do is practice it in the sense of good enough. It doesn't have to be over the moon, just good enough. This comes out of our Dukkha. Now what happens with that is, yeah, just be glad to be here. And then it dawns on us that, hey, we can feel that way all the time. Anytime I remember it, I can feel that way. This is when we really understand it in the sense of this is the path, what is the path and what is not the path. Because look how many people meditate trying to find out what the path is and they don't feel any better.

**Speaker A:** So it's like a light smile, like a light smile at everything.

**Speaker B:** Everything is in the middle, everything is okay. You don't have to go to any extreme.

**Speaker A:** And then while I'm doing that, well, sometimes I would go to the extreme, but sometimes I would just be like, okay, I'm just glad to be here. I have nothing to do. I can just lay here. And then as you said, I would congratulate myself like, hey, congratulations, Rick, you've done it. You're out of Dukkha. You're just happy. But at some point in time, it's like, I don't know what happens, but at some point in time I might just like find some type of path to go down, and like then I'm like, oh no, why am I thinking about all this stuff that I have no point, like I have no business thinking about? That just keeps happening. Like, is it just the practice of, okay, recognizing, hey, I'm distracted, okay, now I'm not distracted anymore, Now I'm happy again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, coming out of that being distracted by something. Maybe the example would fit in the sense, because you mentioned about being in a taxi, how many people are in that taxi, instead of just relaxing, they want the driver to hurry up. They're already in a hurry, and they're not going to get in there any faster by feeling like they're in a hurry. And yet we get into that sense of hurry. Yes, it's not— not everybody has that, but a lot of people do. In fact, in TA, they talk about 5 different drivers, and hurry up is one of them. I certainly had that one. That was my primary life driver. I was in a hurry for everything. And so when I'd be in a taxi cab, they'd say, hey man, I can drive this thing faster than you do. I've actually ridden in a car with people begging, "You ought to hurry up! You're only doing 10 miles an hour over the speed limit, let's go someplace!" Being in a hurry, and whenever we get there, I'm still in a hurry. The hurry doesn't ever stop. It's a feeling, it's a driver that we get into the habit of. Out of a sense of fear that I got to get her done, all right? But other people have the idea of they have to be pleasing to other people. Oh, if I don't please you, everything's going to fall apart. And often we do that when we're lying. If we're lying to somebody to try to please them, there'll be certain facial gestures that we have. 'Let me show you something.' Have you ever seen people do that? They're trying to get you to believe their lie. Moving forward to you like this? Yeah, looking for— and doing this and raising the eyebrows. I can't raise mine, I got out of the habit of having— yeah, right, you can wrinkle your brow, I can't wrinkle mine. Okay, been relaxed too long. Uh, Also one of— you got to get it right, you got to be perfect. Another driver, which is actually we don't see it quite so often with the young men, but in the days of the 1950s and '60s it was called be strong. You got to be tough. Anagami, you got to be there. You got to be, you know, military. We've got an army here, you know. That kind of mentality. Bullies get into that 'be tough' or 'be strong' mentality. And guess what? All of those things, we can relax. 'Be strong, be perfect, please me, try hard'— that's the worst one— and 'hurry up.' The 'try hard' is that you expect to lose, You can't do it, but you gotta at least appear that you can do it. Yeah, you gotta look busy when the boss comes by.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, true, I can recognize that.

**Speaker B:** Got it. Got a tryhard.

**Speaker A:** I've done my best, okay? I've done my best.

**Speaker B:** I've done my best. That's exactly it. That's the tryhard driver. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Interesting. So it would just be— it would just be— so being distracted, is that Dukkha?

**Speaker B:** No, right? Well, it's heading for— it's cruising for a bruising. All right, being distracted while we're driving an automobile is the number one reason for automobile accidents, because we're not watching where we're going. We trip over furniture because we're not watching where we're going. That, in fact, this is something that's quite amusing to me because so much of meditation practices— you've heard it talked about before— about you gotta concentrate. You got to work hard, you got to concentrate, you got to focus. Guess what? Life is not like that. Life can come at you from any direction. The better thing to do is to be alert, to be awake. When you're driving a car, you can't drive the car like this. You're not watching what's going on around you. When you're driving a car, you can be completely relaxed, but you're really watching what's going on. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So I had this image of meditation that meditation should be like, okay, my mind is empty. There's nothing.

**Speaker B:** And then you fuss at yourself when you find it's not empty, rather than enjoying, aha, I see that too. I see that. I see what's going on. So you begin to enjoy— yeah, to observe and to enjoy observing, rather than— because that's the right effort, to enjoy the observing. But most people, they observe and then they don't like what they see, and so they keep looking and keep looking, and they don't like it, but they keep looking at it, and pretty soon they get really miserable because they're looking at something they don't like. But the real point is to observe and take that right effort to say, "It's okay, yeah, I see that." Then we can very easily do what Goenka talks about as "never mind, start again." I can see that the mind has wandered away, but most people when they first start, when they recognize the mind is wandering away, they say, "Oh, you're not supposed to wander away, you're supposed to do what you were told to do!" You gotta have an empty mind. So we don't like it when we don't make the goals. The question is, is not whether you're making the right goal or not. The question is, are you enjoying playing the game?

**Speaker A:** Hmm, that's a good question. I like games.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so life is a game. Enjoy the game. True. You're the only one who's keeping score anyway. Everybody else is keeping their own score.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's fair. That's very fair. I do feel like I look at life like that a little bit, like everything I do is kind of like this game, because it feels like in the grand scheme of things, the only thing that really matters is this moment anyways.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** So everything you do— That's the only.

**Speaker B:** Thing that matters, this breath. I have heard, by the way, in fact on YouTube, it looks like that they're dragging up some really, really old clips, maybe 15, 20 years old. 20 years old of Christopher Hitchens having conversations with Christians. And the Christians come by with the point of God gives meaning to life, that God creates morality, that if you didn't have a God and you didn't have hell, you would be a bad person, right? And Hitchens comes back with that, oh no, Almost all of the stuff is done that's really bad is done in the name of God. Jihad. Okay, let's have some rules about abortion. You know, God made some rules about abortion and we're going to make sure those women suffer.

**Speaker A:** Or crusades.

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] Right, so that's where this whole idea of meaning comes from. It comes from the religious people who think that God gives meaning to life, and if there is no God, there is no meaning. But the right answer to that is, yeah, yippee, there is no meaning. That means I am free from having to take care of all the meaning. Things don't mean anything, and so I'm free.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I could just enjoy it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I can just enjoy it. I don't have to keep score and make score and win points and suck up to God or any of that kind of stuff. I'm free. Life has no meaning. It just is. Can you enjoy it? If there is any meaning in life, it's can you enjoy being alive?

**Speaker A:** But I feel like it's— is it strange that when you say there is no meaning, I also feel a little bit afraid? But is that holding on to— is that holding on to familiarity? The, the one thing of like, there has to be something, there's got to.

**Speaker B:** Be some meaning out there. But it's just all of— I mean, it's part of Hitler's, uh, Mein Kampf, it's part of the propaganda. They're going to get you to contribute to the church. They're going to get you to go to the job. They're going to get you to conform to their rules. They're going to get you to be a good citizen because there's meaning in life.

**Speaker A:** To add to society, right?

**Speaker B:** To add to society, you've got to contribute to society because the society had meaning. No, it doesn't. Don't mean a thing.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** It only means something to people who want it to have meaning because they were taught that. Yeah, and we were taught that back from our grandparents and our great-grandparents and our great-great-grandparents. It just goes back and back and back. Even before the feudal times, of one group of people oppressing another by telling them that they've got to have meaning in their lives and contribute to me. And when you tell those old bosses, hey man, you don't mean anything to me, I don't have to do it the way you want me to do it, I'm free.

**Speaker A:** I would bet they won't like that because it threatens their existence.

**Speaker B:** It threatens them, right? Because if they can't get you to do it for them, who can they get to do it? Yeah. What is it? Make them, uh, fulfill their greed. Yeah. So, and when we come out of our greed, then there's no meaning. Yeah, you're okay, we're happy. Go ahead.

**Speaker A:** So if there is no meaning to anything, basically, do you believe in like karma and the feeling of like, okay, I've done a transgression and this has some type of bad effect on me?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, because I don't like that I screwed up. And I create a hell for myself to punish myself because I've screwed up.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Instead of just saying, never mind.

**Speaker A:** I feel like this is such a.

**Speaker B:** Weird.

**Speaker A:** Idea of just if you've done something bad, just forgiving yourself.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, get over it.

**Speaker A:** And just don't do it again because it's unwholesome, right?

**Speaker B:** Because look at the state that you got yourself into when you did something that you call bad. And there are certain things called wrongdoing And what are they? That which causes Dukkha is the wrongdoing. So an example of that is farting in public. Why is that? Why is farting in public a wrongdoing? Why is it bad?

**Speaker A:** I think because other people are experiencing an unpleasant smell.

**Speaker B:** Right, they don't like it. So when they fart, they don't like it, instead of, wow, I just farted, what a relief, I'm glad it wasn't wet.

**Speaker A:** I'm gonna start doing that from now on. But isn't you the one who decides if it creates Dukkha as well?

**Speaker B:** Well, yes. And one of the things that we can do is we can observe our own mind, our own feelings, and we can observe the reactions of others. That in fact, if somebody doesn't like it and they start to pretend to choke and do like this and all of that, you can do that too and be happy. Wow, that was a big one, wasn't it? Haha, what a stink bomb I let off that time! Got your reaction, didn't I? And cheer them up rather than, oh, I didn't do it. He who smelt it dealt it. You know, and then everybody feels bad. Why do people feel bad when somebody farts? Why can't we just— how with laughter?

**Speaker A:** I don't know, just because you're taught that way.

**Speaker B:** We're taught that way, precisely. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Just by inferring it.

**Speaker B:** Yes. And look how much Dukkha we have because we are taught to be in a state of suffering. We're taught that there's rules against doing that. And if we can observe and know there's certain— for instance, Taking things that are not given causes people real Dukkha. And so we don't do that kind of stuff.

**Speaker A:** And it gives other people Dukkha, or yourself Dukkha.

**Speaker B:** You're right, you give people Dukkha and they'll give it back to you. If you give other people Dukkha, then we'll feel bad anyway. So we abstain from doing things that harm ourselves and harm other people. This whole teaching is about Dukkha and getting out of it. So if you can see it in the distance, sidestep it, avoid it. For instance, anybody who criticizes you is already in Dukkha. And if you deny what they're saying, if you deny it, that means that they wounded you, they hit you. And you don't like it. But if you have the attitude, ah, you missed me, I don't know who you're complaining about, but it ain't me, it's your imagination of who I am. You don't know who I am. You— all you know is what you believe, and that causes you Dukkha. But if I buy into it, now both people are in Dukkha. But if I can just sidestep it, didn't affect me, then I can just let it drop and so can they. But Reddit is full of people who will criticize people and then they have to criticize back, they have to defend themselves. There's a good song, I don't know who wrote it, or who sang it, but it's a popular song, and it says— it goes like, 'Da da da da da, can't touch me.' So begin to live your life as if things just can't touch you. Yeah, another way of talking about it is, is that revenge is best served cold. Don't try to get revenge when you're hot. Just cool off. And then the second part of that is that the best revenge is living well. The best revenge is, "Hey, he didn't touch me." Yeah, so what? He said something, it didn't bother me. Let them criticize, it's not my problem. But if you criticize them back, you've got an argument going. True, true.

**Speaker A:** If you don't put any energy in it, then they've only wasted theirs.

**Speaker B:** Right. And that's okay with me.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Very true.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's all right. Let them criticize. Because they didn't criticize me. Because I wasn't there to be criticized. They're just criticizing. I don't have to own it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, they just criticize the idea that they have of you.

**Speaker B:** They're just criticizing the idea in their own head. Yeah. And when they criticize, and they criticize me, it's because I bought into it. I made myself a target. I stood up to get shot. But if I'm laid back and they shoot something at the Arahant, at me, it just goes right by. Yeah, they miss me, can't touch me.

**Speaker A:** Can't touch me. I know that song. I think it's MC Hammer, right?

**Speaker B:** Uh, something like that.

**Speaker A:** Can't touch this. Yeah, true.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I'm living well. They can't touch me. There's no reason to take revenge. There's no reason to try to get them back, but they didn't get me at all.

**Speaker A:** You just.

**Speaker B:** Said— there's a line in the Dhammapada that says that when somebody says something like, 'He insulted me, he hurt me, he did something to me,' then I'm the one who's feeling bad. And so I'll say, 'He hurt me, he touched me.' 'He dealt me a bad deal.' But wise people don't say that. They say, 'Ah, never mind.

**Speaker A:** It's not worth the effort.'.

**Speaker B:** It's not worth the effort, which means that we have to take the right effort to not take that effort. That's one's right noble effort. Is to get out of the way.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Sounds good.

**Speaker A:** Sounds pretty easy. And sometimes I have this feeling of like that, okay, there is something that happened and I feel like it doesn't even affect me, but then other people are telling you like 'Oh, but this is bad,' like, 'Oh, you should do something about it.' And like, should I now?

**Speaker B:** Or, you know, it's like that is no. Why do you get touched by that? It didn't bother me. Yeah, true. Yeah, they'll get uptight because they get uptight. Even though that it was you that got insulted, they want you to be feeling insulted because they feel insulted for you. Yeah, they, they came and stood and got hit by the arrow that was intended for you. Yeah. And you could do something silly like saying, I'm sure I'm glad that it's you that feels bad, otherwise it'd have to be me now, wouldn't it? Thanks for standing, you know. Thanks for taking— Yeah, thanks for taking a bullet for me. Thanks.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's a nice one.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, why don't we finish now? Because you're going to come over tomorrow and we'll talk some more.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, what— is there a particular time that I should come, or can I just come early morning?

**Speaker B:** What works well? Yeah, come on over. What, uh, when you say early, what kind of time is your boat? Oh, I haven't even looked at the.

**Speaker A:** Boats yet, but let me look at the boats.

**Speaker B:** So by the time that you get here, if you get up and get early on a boat and get over here, by the time the boat arrives, it's not early anymore.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Um, as soon as you get on the island, you— do you have a cell phone that has, uh, uh, internet connection? Okay, so you got Skype. Just Skype me when you, uh, when.

**Speaker A:** You get on the— I'll just Skype you when I'm there, and I'll send Cat a text to, uh, to maybe go wad hopping if he— Right.

**Speaker B:** When, when you, uh, when you get your time schedule on the boat before you leave, tell us what time you're getting here and we'll be ready for you. Cat can probably come to the, uh, pier to get you.

**Speaker A:** Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. I would really appreciate that. Okay, nice. All right, well, I'm really looking forward to see you tomorrow.

**Speaker B:** Okay, me too. We'll see you.

**Speaker A:** See you. See you, Dhammarato. Thank you so much for the call. Take care.

**Speaker B:** All right, okay, bye-bye. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) in dialogue with a Sangha friend (Speaker A), revolves around the core Buddhist practice of overcoming habitual suffering (dukkha) by retraining the mind through familiarity, relaxation, and right effort. Here is a summary of the key themes and teachings:

### **Core Themes & Teachings**

1.  **The Power of Familiarity & Habit:** The discussion begins by exploring how humans are wired through evolution and upbringing to react to perceived threats (like a stick resembling a snake) and to cling to familiar patterns, even if they are unwholesome. Our childhood conditioning often leads us to live lives of "quiet desperation," doing things out of obligation rather than joy.

2.  **"Fake It Till You Make It" (The Wholesome Way):** A central practical method is introduced. Instead of waiting to feel okay to act okay, you consciously adopt the thoughts, posture, and attitude of one who is already well, relaxed, and "at home." By repeatedly planting and nurturing these "seeds" of wholesome thoughts (e.g., "I'm okay," "I'm at home"), they grow into a sustained state of well-being. This is contrasted with being a "charlatan" who fakes for deceit.

3.  **Finding "Home" in the Present Moment:** Using the Buddha's analogy from the suttas (MN 39), the talk compares freedom from mental hindrances to the relief of getting out of debt, being released from prison, recovering from sickness, or finally arriving home after a long journey. The practice is to cultivate this "arrived," at-home feeling **now**, regardless of external circumstances—whether in a taxi, on a plane, or amidst a hectic travel schedule.

4.  **Right Effort is Relaxed & Consistent:** The initial effort to establish a practice (like gladdening the mind or mindfulness of breath) can be work, akin to pushing a car to start it. However, once momentum is built, the effort shifts to a gentle, consistent "touch" to maintain it. The goal is daily, light practice rather than intense bursts followed by quitting. The emphasis is on **enjoying the process** of observation itself, not on achieving a perfectly empty mind.

5.  **Deconstructing "Obligation" and "Meaning":** The talk challenges deep-seated societal conditioning:
    *   **Obligation:** We often act from a burdensome sense of debt or duty (e.g., calling a relative). The practice is to transform these actions by doing them happily and freely, not out of pressured obligation.
    *   **Meaning:** The idea that life must have an external, grand meaning (often imposed by religion or society) is questioned. True freedom is found in realizing life "doesn't mean a thing," allowing you to simply **enjoy being alive** in the present moment without the burden of conforming to external narratives.

6.  **Practical Applications & Similes:**
    *   **Gladdening the Mind:** A simple practice of taking short breaks (e.g., 5 minutes per hour) to intentionally generate feelings of joy, safety, and well-being.
    *   **Dealing with Criticism:** Develop an attitude of "can't touch me." See criticism as the other person's mental projection and dukkha; don't "buy into it" or own it. The best "revenge" is living well and unaffected.
    *   **The Middle Path:** Aim for a relaxed, "good enough" happiness—a light smile—rather than chasing extreme, euphoric states.
    *   **Karma & Wrongdoing:** Wrongdoing is simply that which creates dukkha for yourself or others. The appropriate response is to see the resulting state, forgive yourself, resolve not to repeat it, and move on without self-punishment.

### **Conclusion**

The talk is a practical guide to undoing habitual suffering. The path is framed not as a grim struggle, but as a gentle, playful retraining of the mind. By repeatedly choosing familiar wholesome thoughts ("I'm okay," "I'm home"), doing consistent light practice, relaxing into the present, and shedding burdens of obligation and imposed meaning, one can cultivate a profound and resilient sense of well-being independent of external conditions. The ultimate goal is to enjoy the "game" of life itself, breath by breath.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Speaker B, Dhammarato) uses a rich tapestry of metaphors and illustrative stories to explain Buddhist and psychological concepts. Here is a breakdown of the main ones:

### **Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **The Snake/Stick Metaphor:** Used to explain our instinctual, fearful reactions. We react to a stick on the ground as if it were a snake because that deep-seated caution is evolutionarily advantageous. This illustrates how we often react to perceived threats (the unknown/unfamiliar) that aren't real dangers.

2.  **The Crocodile and the Stork:** A story to illustrate the "fear of the unknown" and the survival instinct. Whoever sees the other first wins. This explains why we are hardwired to be startled—it's better to be jumpy and safe than to be caught unaware by danger.

3.  **"Fake it till you make it" / The Seed and Bush:** The idea is presented in two ways:
    *   **The Charlatan:** The negative path—faking unwholesome qualities leads to becoming a skilled faker.
    *   **The Enlightened Seed:** The positive path—planting and nurturing the seed of a thought like "I'm okay" allows it to grow into a "full-blown bush" of genuine well-being.

4.  **The Child Learning a Skill (Piano/Chopsticks):** Practicing feeling "okay" is compared to a child learning a skill. At first, it's difficult and requires effort, but with consistent practice, it becomes easy and natural.

5.  **Pushing the Car / The Swing / The Merry-Go-Round:** A set of related metaphors for meditation practice.
    *   **Pushing the Car:** Starting a practice requires a big initial effort (pushing the car to start it), but maintaining it is easier (keeping it rolling).
    *   **The Swing:** The first push is hard work, but once swinging, only a light touch is needed to maintain momentum.
    *   **The Merry-Go-Round:** It takes work to get it spinning, but once it is, you can just enjoy the ride. These all emphasize that consistent, light-touch practice is more sustainable than intense, sporadic effort.

6.  **The Gym and Light Dumbbells:** Meditation (Anapanasati) is compared to starting at the gym. You don't start with heavy weights; you start with light ones (simple, easy practices like focusing on breath or gladdening the mind) and do many repetitions to build strength.

7.  **The Middle Path as a Political Spectrum:** He uses the metaphor of American politics (Democrat vs. Republican) to explain the difficulty of the "Middle Path." To those at either extreme, someone in the middle can appear to be on the opposite side. The goal is not an extreme of ecstasy, but a sustainable "good enough" or "light smile."

8.  **"Can't Touch Me" / The Unhit Target:** This is a metaphor for non-attachment to criticism. If you don't identify with or "buy into" an insult, it's like an arrow that misses its target. The critic is only criticizing an idea in their own head, not you. The "best revenge is living well."

9.  **Life as a Game:** The point of life and meditation isn't to "win" by achieving a perfectly empty mind, but to "enjoy playing the game." The right question is: "Are you enjoying observing your experience?"

### **Stories & Anecdotes**

1.  **The Father and the Grass/ Room:** A personal story to illustrate how societal "obligation" is taught. The father calls the son lazy for not cutting the grass, but the speaker reframes it: the father is the one who wants the grass cut but doesn't want to do it himself. A wiser approach would be to make a game of cleaning, transforming obligation into fun.

2.  **The Thai Traffic Directors:** An anecdote about seeing people in Koh Samui pointlessly directing traffic outside hotels. This illustrates the cultural concept of "full employment"—creating jobs for the sake of having a job, not out of necessity. It ties back to doing things out of familiar obligation rather than genuine purpose.

3.  **The Journey to Wat Suan Mokkh:** A personal pilgrimage story. After years of restless travel, arriving at the monastery and being welcomed by the teacher (Achan Po) gave him an immediate sense of being "home." The moral is that we can cultivate this feeling of being "at home" and arrived anywhere, even in a taxi or airport, by letting go of the anxiety of the journey.

4.  **The Five Hindrances as Freedom Stories:** He references the Buddha's metaphors (from Sutta 39) for freedom from mental hindrances:
    *   **Freedom from Debt:** The relief of not owing anything.
    *   **Arriving Home from a Journey:** The feeling of putting down your bags after a long trip.
    *   **Release from Prison:** The liberation of being free.
    *   **Recovery from Sickness:** The wellness of being healthy.
    *   **Being Fired from a Hated Job:** The relief of no longer having to do a burdensome task. These are all states of relief we can mentally access to counteract feelings of obligation, anxiety, and burden.

5.  **Transactional Analysis (TA) "Drivers":** He references the psychological model of "life drivers" (Hurry Up, Be Perfect, Please Others, Be Strong, Try Hard) as metaphors for the unconscious, stressful scripts we operate from. Meditation is about relaxing these drivers.

**Core Themes These Metaphors Support:**
*   Overcoming instinctual fear and embracing the unfamiliar.
*   Transforming obligation and habit into choice and joy.
*   The importance of consistent, gentle practice over forceful, sporadic effort.
*   Cultivating a sense of "already being okay" and "being at home" in the present moment.
*   Seeing life as a meaningless (in a liberating way) game to be enjoyed, not a scored test to be passed.
