### Transcript


**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] There is only one thing that the Buddha actually specifically taught that is the most easy to understand, is that he said to sit upright. And there's some really important physics or engineering reasons to do that, in the sense that the sitting upright means that the body is like this, and that the center of gravity is within the body. And so gravity is pulling us straight down. So sitting up straight is the right way to sit. If we sit in any angle at all, it's going to cause the center of gravity to shift. So if we're leaning over, then the center of gravity is shifting over here, which means now that the muscles of the back have to actually work. To keep you in, even though it feels more relaxed to just let go. But by doing so, the back will start to hurt. And so sitting upright is the only important point about posture. Another important point that is referenced other places is relaxation of the body. Now we can do both of those, both sitting upright and relaxing at the same time. Then in fact, step 4 of Anapanasati Bhante, is all about relaxing the body. And that we can learn to relax the body, but we have to relax the mind as well. When the body and the mind are both relaxed together, then that's a good relaxation. If the body is relaxed but the mind is in turmoil, that's not necessarily so much relaxation, and then possibly the body is going to have a whole lot more movement. The real idea of relaxation is, is that it becomes not agitated and not moving around a lot, but rather just able to sit and rest and comfortable. So we're looking at three things. One is upright. The other one is comfortable. And relaxed. But now, these three features that we're talking about— the posture of the body— in fact, we can take those three features to our entire lives. The entire practice of Anapanasati is the practice of living our lives where we live our lives upright, relaxed, and comfortable. So, we're going to actually intentionally practice that with the body, knowing that ultimately that that's going to come onto the whole lifestyle. And so, we actually practice sitting up straight. In meditation retreats, they will give people a task of sitting up as straight as they can, as if there were some sort of rope or something is suspended from the top of the head, pulling them up. And then after we get the back straight like that, now we imagine that that rope is cut and we're going to relax by falling straight back down. Okay, so that straight back down is a relaxed posture, but it's also sitting up straight. Now, there's something else about cross-legged. It is natural for someone who is sitting on the floor to sit cross-legged. That in fact, even when we're sitting in chair, we will often sit cross-legged, even with the ankles crossed or with the knees crossed, or maybe the calf of one leg is sitting on the the foreleg up like this. So the whole concept of cross-legged is not a big deal. And yet the Western English translations have the word cross-legged in the translations themselves. But the Pali word isn't cross-legged. It's talking about a seat. And then in fact, the sitting or the seat can also be a chair or a couch, or it can be a divan or a device or something like that that we're sitting upon. It's not necessarily cross-legged.

**Speaker B:** About that, I've been using a Zen bench, you know those?

**Speaker A:** Yes, I know.

**Speaker B:** And this has like a little angle. Does that affect like the straightness? Or can you compensate for the natural curve of the back? Or—

**Speaker A:** All right, guess what? The Buddha didn't have Zen bench.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I figured that.

**Speaker A:** That in Japan, the sitting posture on the floor is a military posture, not a sitting posture. A sitting posture is a posture to be comfortable so that you can stay there for a long period of time. This is the Zen Japanese military posture, is designed to be able to get up quickly so that you can be having a conversation with somebody in Japan. Both of them are sitting down. So that basically the buttocks is sitting on the heels and the foot is flat on the floor, sitting on the heels. This can often put pressure on the knees, especially if there's excess weight or whatever. Thin legs, no problem. But if there's too much fat on the calf of the leg or the underside of the bigger part of the leg, then that will actually put extra pressure on the knees. And so people have a lot of trouble with that. Also, sitting on one's heels, the feet get tired. But if you're sitting in that posture, then it is very easy for you to raise up on your knees, grab one foot and put it on the floor and be standing within half a second. And at the same time, while you're doing that, the left hand has its hand on the hilt of the sword where you're pushing the sword out. So that the sword is in midair as you're going into midair, so the right hand can grab the sword after it's already been pushed out of the scabbard and you can grab it with the second hand and whack like this. And this is— this is a Zen military posture that's designed to be able to get up for an attack instantly. Right now, so not good. Taking that into meditation and the Westerners, they can't sit on their heels. They've never been able to do that. It hurts. It hurts the heels. It hurts the bottom part or the top part of the foot that's on the floor. It hurts the knees. And so the obvious thing to do is to put the Zen bench. Well, guess what? The swordsman, the samurai who is sitting in that posture, if he is sitting on a Zen bench, he more than likely will fall down when he's trying to get up. Because it's going to do all of that in a second and you don't have time to do anything with that Zen bench other than hope that it doesn't trip you up because you're just going to get up. All right. And so that Zen bench has got absolutely no value at all. I can't see any value in having a Zen bench because what it means, the Zen bench is so to help you to sit into a posture that's not intended to be comfortable in the first place. If what is— so you're adding the Zen bench in order to give yourself a bit of comfort while sitting in a posture that's intended to not be comfortable, is intended to be a strike posture. Okay, so you can take the imagination of runners who are about to do, let's say, the 100-yard dash, just a few seconds instant before the gun goes off for the start of the race. How are those guys postured? What kind of position are they in? They're in a position to get ready to run, right? And so they're ready to run. Well, that Zen posture is a posture of sitting down that's ready to run. It's not designed to stay there for a long period of time comfortably. And so I would recommend giving up the Zen bench, giving up the posture of the Zen bench and sit down instead, comfortably. So long as you're sitting upright, so long as you're sitting comfortably and relaxed. And if you're sitting and you're not comfortable and not relaxed, then you can recognize that because of pains or tensions or whatever like that. Then you adjust the posture so that you come back to being comfortable. Even if that means standing up. But they don't like it in the meditation hall when students stand up unless that's part of the program. That's one of the big differences between the meditation retreats at Wat Soi Molk and others, is that there they sit shorter periods of time and they also give the students the ability to stand up. Because it's more important to keep the body comfortable than it is to maintain or be in any particular posture. That comfort is what we're looking for. So here you are out in the woods. How can you relax and be comfortable? If you lay down in the dirt, you might have all kinds of ants or stuff crawling on you that you need to lay out something. And then sitting down and sitting up erect is the right way to do it. So that's the old tradition, is that the easiest way to sit, to be relaxed when you don't have any furniture. But now that you do have furniture, you don't have to have any silly rules. Oh, I've got to practice as if I had no furniture because people used to practice that didn't have any furniture. Therefore, I've got to not use furniture. But it's okay to use the furniture. The point is, is can you sit upright? Can you sit relaxed? And can you sit comfortably? And it doesn't matter what posture you're in so long as you're maintaining that. Then, in fact, the Buddha talks about all four postures: the posture of standing, the posture of sitting, the posture of laying down, and the posture of walking. And so we're going to go back to all three of those points for each one of the postures. When you're laying down, can you lay down upright or in fact erect? And this is what you would mean in the sense of the lion's pose or the lion posture of laying on the side. So when you're in bed, you lay down on the side, on your right side. Doesn't matter whether it's the right side or the left side. There's physiological reasons for one or the other, but having the other one as an alternate is helping you to relax and stay comfortable. Sometimes you can lay too long in one posture to change your posture, but you don't change the posture to lay on the back or change your posture to lay on the stomach. Rather, you change your posture to move over to lay on the other side. Okay. All right. So this is the whole quality of sitting, the quality of being upright, quality of being comfortable and going in the direction of relaxing the body. And as you relax, as you investigate the body and manage the breathing, as well as manage the mind. When the mind becomes more relaxed, the body will relax, that we actually store mental tensions in the body through chemistry. So the way the tensions out of the body is by getting the tensions out of the mind also. Then we can really relax. Okay, so these are the qualities of the posture, is that we're wanting to sit or stand or even lay down upright, comfortable, and relaxed. And so remembering that over and over again, you can check to see, is the body comfortable? Is the body upright? Is it relaxed? And you can check that out from time to time. Okay. Does that answer your question or do you have any questions more than that for posture?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it doesn't have to be totally upright because I have like my neck is a bit bent forward. So I feel like to be upright, I have to have like a constant effort that messes, that subtracts from the comfort of it.

**Speaker A:** Right. So effort is what we're not looking at. So when there seems to be a dichotomy for this, then we want to maintain upright simply because it is comfortable. What you're talking about is more of a rigid, uptight, or holding the back up or whatever like that. But a good way of doing it is by standing against the wall and feeling how much of the wall you can feel with your body. Can you actually put both your shoulder blades and the back of your head and your butt and the calf of your leg and the heels and all of that against the wall? That will help you to understand what it means to sit upright or to stand upright or actually sitting against the wall as opposed to leaning against the wall. But it's better to actually— if you— if your back is hurting, then you can actually sit with the back against the wall so that you can use the wall to help you sit straight. Now, the whole quality is, is that we're not trying to hold the head to make sure that it's straight and adding tension. No, we're wanting to sit with it straight simply because that's a comfortable way to sit.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I wondered about that because of what you said about the center of gravity. But yeah, I'll do it.

**Speaker A:** Okay, excellent. All right, well, we've got that covered then. Any other questions about posture?

**Speaker B:** You didn't mention anything about stillness. Stillness is not the same as quietness, right?

**Speaker A:** Actually, that is something that you can practice in other places. And when I say practice, I'm actually talking about it in the sense of a toy or a skill to be developed. An example of that is watching what your hands are doing and begin to slow them down. Another example would be how much tension do you have in the hands so that the hands are actually in a state of movement, or can you actually just hold the hand still by relaxing it? Okay, so you can play with the hand like that and get that so that you can begin then to add that to the body. In other words, can you hold your hand up like this and hold it still but relax it? Because mostly when we think of holding something still, we hold it by holding tight to it, grasping and clinging on it, or adding tension to it. But the secret of holding it still is by letting it relax.

**Speaker B:** Just, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And with it relaxed, then it's really easy just to hold it very still. So this is one of the things then you can begin to play with, is by playing with the hands, moving them very slowly, touching, getting in tune with being inside of the hands. Mostly when we think of the hands, we think of the object that we're holding with the hands. So when I'm picking something up and holding it, I'm thinking about the object rather than the holding it. So what we want to do is to come out of the object into the fingers and start feeling the tips of the fingers. An example would be that when you're setting something down, what's the last touch sensation point in your hand? You might even want to stylize it so that the last— whenever you set something down, the last thing that you leave touching is the side of the baby finger. You don't leave it, just let it go. No, you always leave it with the idea that you've got that last baby finger and that's going to be the last thing that leaves. Okay, so we begin to play with it with a toy, or mindfully knowing what the hands are doing, so that you can do things very easily. And very simply with great feelings of joy. I mean, it feels so good to just to put the fingers together. How it feels so nice. Mm-hmm. Feels so nice to get into the sense of touch. So this is the way that we can practice this posturing, is to be aware of the hands throughout the day, as well as when we're in any particular sitting posture. But these are what they call the mudras, and there's a lot of different mudras. And the word mudra, the word mu is for the word hand. So drawing of the hand or the movements of the hand are the mudras or the poses of the hands. One of them is this pose of holding the hand out like this. And the idea is that you're putting all of your awareness, all your focus, all of your mentality into the palm of the hand with the idea of opening it up as if it were a conduit of joy or energy that you can radiate like that with the palm of the hand. And let that palm of the hand become vibrantly alive.

**Speaker B:** I thought you didn't like that type of stuff.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** I thought you didn't like that type of stuff.

**Speaker A:** The magic part of it, to think that it is magical. Is something that I would say no, we're looking for something real.

**Speaker B:** No, but I don't see it necessarily as magical, but that the visualization helps in a certain way, or the idea.

**Speaker A:** Well, we're talking about building up awareness, building up mental states, building up sensations, actually doing things that change the physiology of the hands so that the hands themselves become warmer rather than cold hands. We have hot hands. How do we have hot hands? Is by paying attention to the hands, thinking about the hands, allowing the blood flow to go into the hands. These are the Mudras. Okay. And so one of the Mudras is to have the right hand over the left, over the right knee. Down so that the lowest finger can touch the earth. This is called the Touch of the Earth posture, so that you can actually use that finger to touch the floor to make sure that you're still on the floor. If you have the— if you've gotten so deep into meditation or so outblown or whatever like that, that you have the sensation of flying through the air, you could reassure yourself that you're not flying through the air, you're still on the ground, and you could touch the earth with that index finger or not the index, but the long finger, the middle finger. So that's part of the mudras is we use the hands. We can use the hands to put them together. We can touch the thumbs. We can use this one where we're using the thumb and the index finger and we begin to play with that touch sensation between the two. How close can you get them so that they can feel each other but not actually physically touch yet. In other words, how can you increase your boundaries? Can you begin to see that there's something connecting between the fingers without them actually touching? Okay, so this is one of the ways that we can begin to play with the body, playing with the hands. Another thing to do with the hands is only touch the face or the head Consciously. And we do it with slowness. That we're talking about itching and scratching to where people will scratch and do things like that or whatever, and they do it absent-mindedly. I'm not saying to stop doing any of that stuff. I'm saying that we slow it down and we do it mindfully so that if we want to scratch the head, we could do it like this, gently. Comfortably, easily. An itch over here. Ah, yes. Okay, so this is the way that we begin to operate with the hands. Do everything with the hands with full awareness or paying attention to what the hands are doing. But this is all part of posture. So how are we going to deal with the hands? We're going to deal with the hands that they're upright. They're comfortable and they're relaxed.

**Speaker B:** How is the hand upright? Like the fingers stretched?

**Speaker A:** Well, when I'm talking about upright, I'm not talking about stiff, but I'm talking about relaxed. In this case, the uprightness has to do with that we're not grabbing things. The uprightness here would be the uprightness that you would have in the sense of high-class morality, that we don't grasp and cling to things, that we're paying more attention to what the hands are doing as we lift an object. Okay, so there's a difference between lifting an object and grabbing it. Grabbing it is not upright. Setting it down absent-mindedly is not upright, but genuinely placing objects, picking them up mindfully, that would be operating upright and comfortable and relaxed. So those three qualities for posture quality being upright, Relaxed and comfortable. And so you mentioned relaxing the hands, having the hands be comfortable. Go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I wanted to ask you also about the meditation times or times of the meditation sessions. You mentioned once that it's better to practice more often in shorter intervals.

**Speaker A:** Yes.

**Speaker B:** Than to practice for 1 hour and suffer through it.

**Speaker A:** Right. Because that last half hour, people are struggling. They're not comfortable. They're not upright, but they're putting in the time because they think that they should be putting in the time. No, it's better to do the practice of Anapanasati when the mind is fresh. Rather than tired. And so sitting too long is one of the dangers, but I do recommend doing it often and doing it a lot, several times a day rather than once a day.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so I wanted to ask you about what are some of the, like, markers for when you have been sitting too long instead of not putting in the right effort?

**Speaker A:** Discomfort, unrelaxed, tensions, pain, struggle. That would be too much. And so when you have discomfort, unrelaxed, painful, that's the time to change your posture. If you're sitting, stand up, stretch, do some walking. These are the things that you can do. Sitting too long is done because people think that they're going to get something out of it. We're not trying to get anything out of this practice. What we're doing instead is enjoying the practice while we're doing it. So sitting too long in the mind and the body gets uncomfortable— why do that? The whole point about this practice is to get relaxed and comfortable. We're practicing getting the mind relaxed, comfortable, and upright, filled with wholesome thoughts rather than unwholesome thoughts. Okay. Okay. So let's not sit too long, because when we sit too long, we get tired and we get uncomfortable, and then we start to push and force ourselves, which is what we've been doing our whole lives. So you're just now in the second half hour of the sitting hour. People are actually reinforcing their worst habits instead of practicing correctly.

**Speaker B:** And okay, so the pillars are Piti and Sukkha. That's what, like, a beginner has to cultivate a baseline of, right?

**Speaker A:** Well, to get yourself into a state of Sukkha, which means to get yourself into a state of comfort, relaxed, feeling safe and secure, because if you feel unsafe and insecure, then you're not going to be comfortable. So part of being comfortable is to feel safe and relaxed. And with that comfort, safety, and security, you can then add the fourth ingredient, which is satisfaction. Ah, this is okay right now. Everything is all right right now. Everything is good.

**Speaker B:** So Sukkha comes first.

**Speaker A:** Yes, Dukkha comes first. And then Piti will build up and then it will subside back into Sukkha.

**Speaker B:** Hmm.

**Speaker A:** OK, but the Piti also has the quality of the attitude of I can do this, the attitude of success. Mm-hmm. And the success is the success of skill building, not the constructed item. Like, for instance, a house of cards. Many people think of their meditation practices like a house of cards that they can work really hard or whatever and get the house of cards built. And then just one little thing will happen and the whole thing falls apart. Right. So we're not trying to become experts at having houses of cards built and maintained. That's not what we're doing. What we're doing instead is building the skill of building houses of cards. Never mind that they fall apart because I've got the skill to build another one. That's what we're looking for, is the skill of getting ourselves into a relaxed, comfortable state, and then we'll fall out of it and we'll be back into suffering and Dukkha and frustrations, anxiety, and all of that again. But never mind. Just because you lost your house of cards doesn't mean that you can't rebuild it. Just take a deep breath and never mind and start again and continue building the skill of relaxation.

**Speaker B:** Do you use distinctive breath rhythms or breath patterns?

**Speaker A:** Or do you— Definitely the breathing is necessary because we're— there are several reasons. One is to energize the body, to give it energy. Also, the out-breathing helps to rid the carbon dioxide and other products that come out of the breath. So it's actually an exhale is a relax or relief or letting go, a sigh, an out-breath. So that's why we want to put the breathing into it, is because it's an integral part of getting the body to relax as well as it's an integral part of learning to understand the body. As I breathe in, I know the breathing. And as I breathe out, I relax. And so the breathing is an important quality, but it has even more than that. And that is that it also has the development of the skill of Sati, to remember. So you remember to take a long, deep in-breath and you remember to take a long, deep out-breath, and then you remember to take another in-breath and then you remember to take another out-breath. Long, deep, relaxed. And so the uprightness in this is the uprightness to remember to keep relaxing, to keep relaxing, to keep relaxing that breath. Long, slow, deep, easy breathing. And by doing so, it builds that skill of remembering to be in the present moment, which is also by breathing. When you're looking at your own breathing, you can't look at last year's breath or next month's breath. You've got to only look It's a breath you're having right now. So that's another quality of the breathing, is it helps you, triggers you into being into the here and now, into the present moment. So it has all of these— you

**Speaker B:** maintain that the same pattern, the same long, deep in-breath and long, deep out-breath, right?

**Speaker A:** Maintain a habit or a pattern and slowing it down. Normally people breathe at about 10 breaths, excuse me, 20 breaths a minute. But that's really fast breathing. That means an in and out breath in 3 seconds. What we're going to do is we're going to make that a 3-second for the in-breath and 3 seconds for the out-breath and maybe a second or so between. So now we're going to have maybe 6 seconds for a breath, which is now 10 breaths a minute. Or we can go down to maybe 10 seconds for a breath, or maybe 8 breaths for a second, uh, 8 seconds for a breath. So you can experiment that with counting and play with it to see what's comfortable for you, because as you progress The breathing will become more comfortable as it slows down so that you're down to about 3 or 4 breaths a minute, which is about 15 seconds for a breath. Okay. Which would be like maybe 8 in the in-breath. Well, 8 in the in and 8 in the out would be 20, and that would be 3 breaths a minute. So you could do 6 in and 6 out and then 3, and that would be 15. That would be 4 breaths a minute. So this is the way to count. This is the way to play with it. But, but the counting is not the important thing. The important thing is to take long, slow, easy, comfortable, relaxed, satisfying breaths.

**Speaker B:** Got it.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I've been practicing breath holds, but I think I could Breathe more slowly when meditating, that would be useful.

**Speaker A:** Yes, if you're really, really going to enjoy your breath, then it's good to slow it down, to really pay attention to the breathing, because the breathing gives you life. Life itself is what we crave for. I mean, if you had a choice between dying now or dying within 2 minutes, or taking a breath, which would you choose?

**Speaker B:** I'll take the 2 minutes.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you'll take another 2 minutes, you'll take another breath, right? Because it's good to be alive. We kind of like it, we appreciate it. So give your breath that, um, that quality. It's keeping you alive, it's giving you life itself. So we can have a gratitude and appreciation, a thankfulness for the breathing.

**Speaker B:** That's in the wholesome thoughts topic.

**Speaker A:** Yes, a wholesome topic. Rather than breathing too because we have to, we're breathing because we enjoy it.

**Speaker B:** Sometimes I like to think about, like, zoom out into, like, imagining the Earth and then the the space, is that wholesome too?

**Speaker A:** Yes. To recognize that the air, the atmosphere that you were around is life-giving, that without that interchange, without that in and out, you die, that you're actually a part of the air that you're breathing. And so we can become friendly with the breath, then we can become friendly with the air. Air that we breathe. And that air is touching everything. So everything that the air that we breathe touches is part of me. That gives us a feeling of unity, a feeling of wholeness, as a feeling that's different from the feeling of individuality, the feeling of us against them, me against the world. I've got to survive against heavy-duty odds. It's the way that we were raised. Now we're just looking at our entire environment as just part of me, just the whole show, it's the friend. We're friendly with everything, including and especially the air that we're breathing.

**Speaker B:** And when we have that, feeling already like going kind of strong. Could that, like, in quotations, transpose to a little bit of Metta meditation when

**Speaker A:** we think about like— That is Metta meditation. I just gave you a Metta meditation. Exactly. That is Metta meditation, being friends with your environment.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so I imagine the important thing is to have that feeling going strong first and then like to expand it, right?

**Speaker A:** Right. We develop that feeling of friendship, camaraderie, easygoing, relaxed, comfortable, and upright. We then take that to other people too, but we have to practice it on the inside first. Because the people that we deal with are probably not going to be relaxed, comfortable, and upright. They're probably going to be bent over, bent out of shape, unrelaxed, and you have to deal with that. Well, the best way to deal with that is not by being in the same condition that they're in, but dealing with them when you've already got and maintained your own upright comfortable, relaxed attitude. So that's Metta, is dealing with the world in a relaxed, comfortable, upright attitude. Easy.

**Speaker B:** That makes me constant. Keep it going.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay, Eric, well, let's finish now. I think that we've gotten this done. Call me soon and keep me informed with how's your practice going.

**Speaker B:** Thank you very much. Have a good day.

**Speaker A:** All righty, we'll see you.


### Summary

Based on the Dhamma talk, here is a summary of the key points discussed by Dhammarato (Speaker A) in response to questions from a Sangha friend (Speaker B):

### **Core Principles of Meditation Posture & Practice**
The central theme is that the Buddha's essential instruction on posture is to **sit upright, comfortably, and relaxed**. These three qualities are not just for meditation but are a metaphor for how to live one's entire life.

**1. The "Upright, Comfortable, Relaxed" Triad:**
*   **Upright:** Sitting with a straight back so the center of gravity is aligned, allowing gravity to pull you straight down without muscular strain. This is not rigid or forced, but natural and easy.
*   **Comfortable:** The posture must be sustainable without pain or struggle. Comfort is a primary goal.
*   **Relaxed:** Both body and mind must be relaxed together. A relaxed body with an agitated mind is not true relaxation.

**2. Practical Posture Advice:**
*   **Forget "Rules":** The specific cross-legged posture is a cultural adaptation, not a Pali canon requirement. The Buddha spoke of using a seat, which can include chairs or benches.
*   **Critique of the Zen Bench:** Dhammarato argues the Zen bench is a prop for a kneeling posture (seiza) that is historically a **military "ready-strike" posture**, not designed for long-term comfort. He advises against using it if it causes discomfort.
*   **Adaptability is Key:** The ultimate aim is to maintain the three qualities (upright, comfortable, relaxed) in **all four postures**: sitting, standing, walking, and lying down. If you become uncomfortable, change your posture—even stand up if needed. Shorter, more frequent sittings are better than long, painful ones that reinforce struggle.

**3. Integrating Mindfulness into Daily Life:**
*   **Hands as a Practice Field:** One can cultivate mindfulness and stillness by paying close, slow, and relaxed attention to the hands' movements and sensations throughout the day (e.g., setting objects down mindfully, touching one's face consciously). This builds awareness and joy in simple actions.
*   **Mudras as Awareness Tools:** Hand positions (mudras) are useful not for "magic," but for directing awareness and energy, helping to create tangible physical sensations like warmth.

**4. The Role of Breathing (Ānāpānasati):**
*   The breath is a central tool because it:
    *   **Energizes and relaxes** the body (especially the out-breath).
    *   **Trains memory (sati)** to stay in the present moment.
    *   **Anchors you in the "here and now."**
*   **Practice:** Focus on **long, slow, deep, easy, and satisfying breaths**. Let the breath naturally slow down (e.g., from a typical 20 breaths/minute to 3-4 breaths/minute). The feeling is more important than counting.

**5. Cultivating the Foundational Mind States:**
*   The practice aims first to cultivate **Sukha** (happiness, comfort, ease, a sense of safety and satisfaction).
*   From Sukha arises **Pīti** (joy, zest, the thrill of "I can do this!").
*   This cycle is a **skill to be developed**, not a fragile state to be maintained. The goal is the ability to return to relaxation, not to build a permanent "house of cards."

**6. Metta (Loving-Kindness) as a Natural Outcome:**
*   By becoming friendly with your breath and your own experience, you naturally develop a sense of unity and friendship with your environment.
*   This feeling of being **"relaxed, comfortable, and upright"** internally is the foundation of Metta. It allows you to interact with an often-stressed world from a place of stability and kindness.

### **Key Takeaways:**
*   **Prioritize comfort and relaxation over rigid form.** The posture is a support, not a goal.
*   **Practice frequently for shorter durations** to keep the mind fresh and avoid reinforcing habits of struggle.
*   **Use the breath as a joyful, life-affirming anchor** for present-moment awareness.
*   **Extend the meditation attitude of "upright, comfortable, relaxed" into all daily activities** through mindful movement.
*   The entire path is about **building the skill of returning to a relaxed and wholesome state of mind**, which then becomes the basis for wise and compassionate living.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several **metaphors and stories** to explain meditation principles, posture, and practice. Here are the key ones:

### **Metaphors:**

1. **The Rope Metaphor for Posture:**  
   - *"As if there were some sort of rope or something is suspended from the top of the head, pulling them up... then imagine that rope is cut and we're going to relax by falling straight back down."*  
   - **Purpose:** Teaches how to align the spine effortlessly—first by elongating, then releasing into a relaxed upright position.

2. **House of Cards vs. Skill Building:**  
   - *"Many people think of their meditation practices like a house of cards... We're not trying to become experts at having houses of cards built and maintained... What we're doing instead is building the skill of building houses of cards."*  
   - **Purpose:** Contrasts fragile, goal-oriented meditation with resilient **skill development**. The aim isn’t a perfect state that collapses easily, but the ability to recreate a relaxed, comfortable state whenever needed.

3. **Breath as Life & Friend:**  
   - *"The breathing gives you life... So give your breath that quality. It's keeping you alive... we can become friendly with the breath, then we can become friendly with the air."*  
   - **Purpose:** Reframes breathing from an automatic function to a **cherished, relational process**—foundational for gratitude, metta (loving-kindness), and interconnection with the environment.

4. **Hands as Conduits of Awareness:**  
   - *"Putting all of your awareness... into the palm of the hand with the idea of opening it up as if it were a conduit of joy or energy."*  
   - **Purpose:** Uses the hand as a **tool for cultivating tactile awareness and radiating intention**, moving focus from objects to sensations.

5. **Center of Gravity & Engineering:**  
   - *"The body is like this, and the center of gravity is within the body... If we sit in any angle at all, it's going to cause the center of gravity to shift."*  
   - **Purpose:** Explains upright posture through **physics**—how leaning creates muscular strain, while alignment allows relaxation.

### **Stories & Anecdotes:**

1. **The Zen Bench & Samurai Posture:**  
   - Explains that the Japanese seated posture (seiza) originates from **samurai readiness**—a position to rise quickly, draw a sword, and strike.  
   - The Zen bench is an adaptation for a posture **not designed for comfort** but for combat alertness.  
   - **Moral:** Don’t adopt a posture meant for "readiness to attack" for meditation; prioritize comfort, relaxation, and uprightness.

2. **Runner’s Starting Block Posture:**  
   - Compares the Zen/seiza posture to a **sprinter before a race**—crouched, tense, ready to move.  
   - **Purpose:** Reinforces that meditation posture should be for sustained comfort, not alert tension.

3. **Touching the Earth Mudra:**  
   - References the **Buddhist story** of the Buddha touching the earth to call it as a witness during enlightenment.  
   - In practice: Letting a finger touch the ground serves as an **anchor to reality**—if you feel like you’re "flying" in meditation, touch the floor to reorient.

4. **Wat Soi Molk Retreat Style:**  
   - Contrasts typical retreats (long sits, no moving) with Wat Soi Molk’s approach: **shorter sits, freedom to stand or adjust**.  
   - **Purpose:** Emphasizes that comfort and relaxation are more important than rigid adherence to a pose.

5. **Conscious Hand Movements:**  
   - Anecdotal instructions: **Slow down scratching, placing objects, or touching your face**—doing each action with mindful attention to sensation.  
   - **Purpose:** Illustrates how to bring "upright, relaxed, comfortable" into daily life through deliberate, sensory-focused action.

### **Overall Themes:**  
- **Posture as a metaphor for life:** Upright (ethical, aware), relaxed (non-grasping), comfortable (easeful).  
- **Meditation as skill-building**, not achieving a fragile state.  
- **Breath as a bridge** to gratitude, interconnection, and metta.  
- **Historical/cultural practices** (like Zen sitting) may have contexts contrary to meditation goals—choose what serves relaxation and awareness.
