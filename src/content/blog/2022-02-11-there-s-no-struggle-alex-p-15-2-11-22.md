### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So what's the buzz? What's happening?

**Speaker B:** Your mom used to say that. So?

**Speaker A:** Comes out of Jesus Christ Superstar, it's a song.

**Speaker B:** Well, the day after we talked— that doesn't matter.

**Speaker A:** Today doesn't matter.

**Speaker B:** That doesn't matter.

**Speaker A:** All of these experiences that you want to tell about really don't matter.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, that don't matter. So I'll say today was a little bit— I congratulate myself for today. I'm proud of myself because— That matters. Yeah, I'm proud of myself because whenever I've been in the quote-unquote ditch, it can be weeks, it can be days. And the time is great, but also the depth of being in that ditch has changed. So today, I noticed, I would say is like being in the ditch, but I didn't stop practicing. I didn't stop throwing out unwholesome thoughts, and smiling, and breathing.

**Speaker A:** And

**Speaker B:** I called Dan because I wanted some help. So I congratulate myself.

**Speaker A:** That's the whole point. You don't need any help, but you're always wanting it. And what I've seen is that if you explain yourself well enough, then you'll get the help you want. I didn't actually

**Speaker B:** want it as much as I usually do. I've wanted less. I've wanted less. My wanting of help is definitely less than it's been.

**Speaker A:** I know. I've watched it happen. Congratulations that you don't want so much.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's nice. And in fact, whenever I see wanting, when But I remember I see that one too. Aha, I see you. Ah, congratulations. Yeah, things that I've struggled with on and off today is struggled, been challenged by, maybe I guess would be a better way to say because we're developing a skill.

**Speaker A:** Right. And there's always— oh, you mean like a, uh, a joust?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I guess you could say.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, with lances and horses and battle gear and all of that. That's a challenge.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Why don't you just think of it as an event? Why does it have to be challenges and struggles? Rather than, 'Ah, there I go again,' I can just see it. The answer to that is probably that you were taught that you have to struggle.

**Speaker B:** Well, when I see that the enthusiasm that I had in the moment prior isn't here now.

**Speaker A:** So what?

**Speaker B:** I think that's a challenge because— No,

**Speaker A:** it's not a challenge. Sometimes you feel like a nut and sometimes you don't.

**Speaker B:** That's what Dan was saying, actually. He said it doesn't actually matter what the result is. What matters is that you practice the same. Guardless. And I loved what he said, because he's like, you got to remember, you've been doing this for 25 years, this Dukkha stuff, and you're like, literally creating new neurons in the brain, that takes some time. So remember, you're in the long game. So maybe you're not going to be like, as great, you know, it's not going to be as easy of a practice day. Like it's been past few days for you or past few weeks. But hey, look at this. The ditch isn't as deep as it's been. Here you are. Still practicing. Oh, it doesn't always feel great. But you're still practicing. And that was pretty cool. I did really well at work today too, even like, it was, you know, it was a little bit more of like a tougher climb up the mountain, but I did it each moment I did it.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's the whole point about breaking things down from a great big mountain or trying to stay out of the ditch permanently. This is the goals. Western mentality is very, very much goal-oriented. And very slowly you're beginning to change the neurons in the mind from that goal-oriented perspective into the what's happening right now perspective. That this moment is the only moment that matters.

**Speaker B:** I wouldn't even say it's the only moment you've got. It's a slow process, but I think it's happened pretty quickly for me. You've said that too.

**Speaker A:** You said it's made fast is a relative term. Oh, I know people who have been making fast progress for the past 50 years and haven't gotten anywhere. Wait, what?

**Speaker B:** That's nuts.

**Speaker A:** No, they look how hard they tried. They struggled. Ah, so they must have gotten a long distance. Still on the same treadmill of looking at Dukkha rather than every time the dukkha comes, throw it out. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** What, um, where my frustration came from today is the thoughts of seeing, oh man, you're not seeing the Dukkha as well as you usually do. It's like, I know Dukkha is— That's just another thought. That's just another one.

**Speaker A:** That's just another wholesome thought.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and I was really tired today. I didn't get much sleep at all. And my girlfriend and I were talking about possibly breaking up in the future. So that, like, you know, that took me for a turn. Circumstances on top of learning this practice was not an ideal mix.

**Speaker A:** Well, let's not go there for several reasons, including whatever happens, that's way off in the future. And that the more you're practicing and being in the moment, the less likelihood of that kind of event happening. Anagami, that people break up because they're not getting along. And here you are learning to get along with yourself. And if you get along with yourself, you'll be able to get along with her.

**Speaker B:** And I also got to be honest with you, Dhammarato, this practice has helped me see that, like, truly, when I'm doing well, like, when I'm really feeling good, I see that I really don't need anyone. Like, I'll be okay either way.

**Speaker A:** The reason why so many are out looking for love— because they depend on it— because they don't already have it, right? And then they sing the song that I like so much: looking for love in all the wrong places.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, they're, you know, It's seeking for that satisfaction, right? It's that whole head trip that we think satisfaction comes from outside of us.

**Speaker A:** Well, I don't really know what the author had in mind of that song. I don't remember it. It's a really old one. But I do understand it from the Dhamma perspective is looking for love in all the wrong places means looking for love outside. In materialism, in other people, and finding a mommy, in all of that. Yeah. And, um, there's actually two ways to do it.

**Speaker B:** Oh really?

**Speaker A:** One is to give yourself the love that you crave, and the other one is just forget about it. You don't need to be loved. Look at all of these years you've been unloved and you survived. You can survive without love.

**Speaker B:** I think like what you're pointing to, the latter, right? Forget about it. That actually paradoxically gives you love.

**Speaker A:** Let us say then that love and satisfaction are interrelated.

**Speaker B:** Interrelated. Yeah, yeah, because like when you're satisfied

**Speaker A:** without love, then you don't need love because you've got all the love you need, right?

**Speaker B:** Exactly right.

**Speaker A:** So that means now that even we can set our standard or our boundaries— I need this much love.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And then we can work to give ourselves that love.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Or we can leave the love as it is and lower our boundaries and lower our standards in case they come up to the same. And so this whole idea of lowering our standards or lowering our boundaries, that in fact, that's something that I see quite a lot in you. It's in everyone, but you've got a kind of a double dose in the sense that you had more than one relative that was really bossy.

**Speaker B:** That's true.

**Speaker A:** And you have learned to be bossy with yourself. And also, when you're bossy with yourself, you wind up being kind of bossy with other people. So let's examine that fact that you're being bossy with yourself because it's an old habit. And those are the sources of actually two different areas. You either work really hard and pass, or you work really hard and fail. Mm-hmm. All right. If you work really hard and pass, that's the be perfect. If you work really hard and fail— and by the way, the standards for failing were set up in the beginning, not in the end. So you already know whether you're going to be doing the pass or the fail. But if you pass, then you do it with that be perfect driver. And if you fail, you do it with the try hard driver. Look how hard I tried. I struggled. Okay, so this is what these words struggle and challenges come from, is because you're If you were running from your be perfect, you said, oh well, I can take care of that too. But in fact, the challenge— you won't feel up to it.

**Speaker B:** Say that again.

**Speaker A:** The challenge is a challenge because you don't feel up to it. The struggle is a struggle because no matter how much you try, you're not going to fail. You're not going to pass. You're going to fail. And so what is needed now is to see those standards that you keep setting for yourself that you pass and fail against and lower your standards.

**Speaker B:** Lower the standards. Yeah, well, that's what I found to

**Speaker A:** the point that whatever you're doing right now is okay, right?

**Speaker B:** And is good enough.

**Speaker A:** And it's good enough.

**Speaker B:** Dan says something like, find the smallest unit of win, or the smallest unit of success you can.

**Speaker A:** That's exactly right. Exactly right. In fact, stop looking for big things and accept that the little ones are already here.

**Speaker B:** And it's good enough. Yeah. And treasure that. Well, it's interesting because I think like what I've started to notice is It's weird, like even today, I would notice like unwholesome thoughts coming in and then I would start thinking like, okay, I got to throw these out. I got to do this, like, you know, work hard, right? Like work hard at it. And sometimes I noticed that I was like, you know what? This is just like, this is too much right now. Like, I'm just going to relax.

**Speaker A:** You're working too hard. Exactly. Those are what we've been telling you right from the beginning that you've been setting really, really high standards. Standards for your meditation.

**Speaker B:** And I said, I'm just going to

**Speaker A:** stop having those standards, that the real meditation is to see the standards and take care of those rather than using the meditation to meet your standards.

**Speaker B:** And I think I might be seeing them because in those moments when I noticed myself working hard, even if I'm doing it really well, like if I'm throwing out the unwholesome thought when I see it and then replacing with wholesome, after a while it gets tiring. So it's like, I just want to relax.

**Speaker A:** And sometimes I just work at becomes tiring.

**Speaker B:** So I just end up like focusing on the breath and enjoying the breath. And I noticed— you don't even have

**Speaker A:** to use the word focus.

**Speaker B:** No, yeah, just enjoying. Well, it's like synonymous with it. Like if I'm enjoying the breath, I'm focusing on the breath. If I'm focusing on the breath, I'm enjoying it.

**Speaker A:** I, I know. Uh, let's, let's put it this way. Let's look at this, okay? Imagine that this is the object or the target or whatever, okay? And that, uh, the mind is like this, okay? It's all over the place.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** What we're looking for is to begin to steady the mind so that they can look at it. So now the hand is doing this. Before, it was all over the place like this. Yeah, yeah, doing this.

**Speaker B:** That's good.

**Speaker A:** What we're looking for is to get it to do this.

**Speaker B:** Oh, okay, okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** And eventually it will do this.

**Speaker B:** I like that.

**Speaker A:** All right, now this is Mahasi Method meditation instead. The mind starts out like this, and the students begin to do this. And they're still struggling.

**Speaker B:** What is the object in this case?

**Speaker A:** Whatever the object is. In the case of Anapanasati, there are 16 objects of meditation.

**Speaker B:** Really?

**Speaker A:** The long in-breath, the long out-breath. Okay, another object would be the body itself, which is a huge number of objects. Then another one would be the actual relaxation of the body.

**Speaker B:** Oh really?

**Speaker A:** Yes. And then another object of meditation would be what is this thought, and then another object of meditation would be the gladdening of the thought. Another object of meditation would be the result of the gladdening of the mind, which is the Sukkha. And we take that as an object.

**Speaker B:** Oh, yeah.

**Speaker A:** And then we take Piti when we get into that yeehaw feeling. We take that yeehaw feeling as an object and let it grow and build.

**Speaker B:** This is so incredible because what I've noticed is that when I get into these states, especially the relaxation one that you were talking about, I noticed that sometimes I can just actually focus on it like as if it was the breath, enjoy it like it was the breath, like it is an object, like there is an actual like object, like tangibility to it.

**Speaker A:** And the experience or the feeling of feeling relaxed or feeling relaxed.

**Speaker B:** Sometimes all I can do is I could just be like, I'll just relax right now and I'll just relax and it'll like, it'll all like wash over me.

**Speaker A:** And so what you thought was because meditation is so much work and I'm so tired, I've got to stop and relax. And by that, you're actually now starting to practice correctly. I know.

**Speaker B:** And that's what I'm starting to see because, okay, so just to be clear, like you don't What I think I'm starting to see is like it starts off with noticing the unwholesome thoughts sometimes and then gladdening the mind. But it doesn't have to, right? It can also just start off like, I'm just going to relax right now. Like, are they just different?

**Speaker A:** That is the wholesome thought. That's the wholesome thought. Hmm. Ah, it's another wholesome thought. Listen to that again. It's not even an English language word, but it is a thought.

**Speaker B:** So is there an order to these processes, or you just pick any one as they occur?

**Speaker A:** One by one as they occur. So the first one that would occur would be Sati, to remember, because if you don't remember to do it Nothing's going to happen.

**Speaker B:** Remember anything to remember? Kind of remembering to look, to look,

**Speaker A:** to remember to look, to remember to wake up, to remember to see what's going on, remember to see what's going on, to come into our senses rather than being in the object of whatever object we have. We come out of the object so that we can view it. So that's waking up.

**Speaker B:** So if I feel like I can just relax or just enjoy the breath and I don't need to go through this mental gymnastics of recognizing an unwholesome thought,

**Speaker A:** replacing it— come out of— we've been teaching you to come out of the gymnastics.

**Speaker B:** Oh shit, hold on one second, my glass dropped. Oopsie. But do you know what I'm saying though?

**Speaker A:** Well, I heard you. Can you take your microphone and move it above your nose? Because your out-breath is hitting the microphone.

**Speaker B:** There. Is that better?

**Speaker A:** That's better.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Just to clarify though, just to clarify though, Dhammarato, what I was saying is noticing that I don't— I want to check in with you and see if this is correct. I don't always have to notice an unwholesome thought and replace it.

**Speaker A:** You use the word always.

**Speaker B:** Okay. So if I want to do correct practice, I don't have to You don't

**Speaker A:** have to have that kind of correct practice. Correct practice, the definition of the correct practice is the cause and effect, in the sense that the result of the correct practice is the intended result. But mostly what we do instead is we define the correct practice in the beginning And then if we follow the correct practice, it will give us the result. One is result-oriented and the other one is getting-it-right-oriented, which is the mental state that you're coming from. Getting it right.

**Speaker B:** We don't want to be result-oriented, though, right? We want to be process-oriented.

**Speaker A:** All right. Well, the process is the result, which is in this case being process-oriented means that the process right now is okay. Or this momentary result is okay. And we don't have to, because it's okay, go back in and compare it to the standards or the rules about how to do this. That what you're doing is very typical. And that is, is that they take the process of Anapanasati as if it were a set of procedures or rules to be written down. And you've got to follow this step and you've got to follow these steps and you've got to follow these steps and you've got to follow these steps.

**Speaker B:** Right?

**Speaker A:** That's how you've been practicing over and over. You've got to follow these steps. Well, that 'got to follow these steps' is the issue of what you need to look at so that you don't have to follow these steps anymore. You can just now relax. But you have to remember that you don't have to follow all the steps. What you need to remember is, is that you're already okay, and that you need to tell yourself that you're already okay. Rather than telling yourself that you've got to follow the steps.

**Speaker B:** So is the whole point for the practitioner to go through that process then, where they're creating all these steps for themselves, to realize that they can just relax?

**Speaker A:** Well, it really has to do with when you're on a journey and you've got mileposts or signs, and people confuse the mileposts and the signs with the actual progress. In other words, we're rule-oriented or rule-bound rather than process-bound. So you got to follow all the steps is just following the rules. And we can come out of the rule-following by seeing the rule-following and say, oh, I don't have to follow that rule. And by that you're actually now practicing correctly. But if you have the rule of, oh, you got to wake up and you got to gladden the mind, and if you're glad in the mind, then you can have Sukkha, and then you can have Piti, and then you got First Jhana, okay, by doing it that way, uh, and comparing every step along the way, uh, we're not really seeing what's going on. Because what's going on is the force of the rules rather than just merely following the process, especially if you got to get it right, because then it's a pass/fail situation and we're not looking at it. Let's go back to the issue of the satisfaction. Just a little bit of satisfaction, a little dab will do you. Okay. In the sense that if you've got a standard or a boundary about satisfaction and anything below this is unsatisfactory, and anything above it is satisfactory, then we begin to set that standard higher and higher. And what we need to do then is to take that standard down below whatever things are right now and put our standards lower than that. Take the rules out of it.

**Speaker B:** Put our standards lower than how we actually feel right now.

**Speaker A:** Put our standards down below where we feel right now so that where we feel right now is up to standards. It's above the standards already. How you feel right now is already good enough. By letting yourself say it's all right, everything is okay. We do that by gladdening the mind, is the same as nourishing ourselves, which in those moments when we're nourishing ourselves and gladdening the mind, we're not operating according to a set of rules or standards. Which is the critical mind or the parent ego state. And a lot of people are practicing Anapanasati. Well, they're practicing some sort of meditation, but they're doing it out of a list of rules. So you should do this way or you should do that way. You do what you're told to do by the guru or whatever like that. And so we do the procedure, but we don't get the benefit out of it because we're in the habit of doing what we're told to do, like going to work and not getting the benefit out of it.

**Speaker B:** This makes sense.

**Speaker A:** You can go to your employer and enjoy it, and if you enjoy it, well, you're not following anybody's rules. You're just enjoying the job and you're enjoying the results. But if you're not doing a good job and you don't enjoy it, then the boss is going to come in and lay down some rules. You got to do it this way and you got to do it that way. Well, you've already got the rules. Now it's time to throw out the rules.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So, yeah, so I needed to kind of get a sense of what this practice was first to realize that I was just creating a set of rules for myself so that then I could actually see that, oh, I don't need the rules anymore.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you don't need the rules.

**Speaker B:** I have enough exposure.

**Speaker A:** Very much like training wheels on a bicycle. A little child needs those training wheels in order to gain balance. But I tell you what, your Grand Prix sprinter on their $10,000 bicycle, the one thing that you have missing on those kind of bicycles is training wheels.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's actually— that's a really good image.

**Speaker A:** He will lose the race if he's got training wheels.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, this makes so much sense because like when I wake up in the morning, I'm thinking like I'm already thinking, you know, like, oh, I gotta, I gotta smile. I gotta like take a big deep breath.

**Speaker A:** I gotta, I gotta, I gotta. Those are the rules instead of, oh, I could take a deep breath now. Oh, I can smile now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So giving yourself permission to do it as opposed to giving yourself orders to do it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so it's, it's not that I'm not gonna be— it's not that I'm— it's not that I'm not gonna stop doing these things that I've been doing, replacing the unwholesome with the— or yeah, replacing the unwholesome with the wholesome and planning the mind and enjoying the breath.

**Speaker A:** It's not Anapanasati. You're doing it because you're nurturing yourself.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Rather than giving yourself orders to do it.

**Speaker B:** And from that perspective, if I'm doing it to nurture myself, like, if I get to catch the drift of what you're saying, it's not about thinking like, oh, what do I do now? Or like, this is correct. Like, this is what I'm supposed to do, or this will lead me to this, or you know, like a math equation. It's more about, oh wait, I could just Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, right? Oh, I could just relax right now and trust that.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, go right in.

**Speaker B:** I mean, just doing that like feels pretty good.

**Speaker A:** So I have— So shuffle until you make it a rule. And then when you make it a rule, when you don't do it, you say, 'Arahant, you didn't do it! I told you how to do it and you didn't do it.' And there we go with all that criticism again. And that's the struggle. The struggle is the sense of failure.

**Speaker B:** So is to let go of the rules, then, making— to say the standards? So is to let go of the standards and the rules, is that the same thing? Is that also to say that— I don't remember what I was going to say.

**Speaker A:** Everything's all right. Everything is fine. Here's a— perhaps you've heard this before. When a woman is giving birth to the baby, her whole body changes hormones. And that when she is presented in the typical hospital setting, when she's given the baby, most of the workers on the ward want to be there at that moment of what they call bonding, when mommy gets her tender infant in her arms and everybody gets teary and jerky, you know, and all of that because of that bonding. That nourishing. That infant will die if that mother does not bond with that child. And when she takes the child home, her job now is to nourish and to nurture that child and to let the child grow on his own. That in fact, about 2 days after the child has been born, it's about time for their first whopper. And the mommy is really, really happy to see that great big light yellow turd come up because it shows that the digestive system is working. All right, now what happens is, is that that nourishment that the mother has gets impacted with the society, that moms can't nourish their child on and on and on and on. And if they do, in our society it gets really weird. Okay, with the young man, for instance, never leaves home. He stays with his mom, and when his mom dies, he dies too, because he's just so, let us say, in that symbiotic relationship. So there's got to be some kind of a transition. The child does have to grow up. Yeah, but we get then into the next stage that in fact Freud really studied this. The developmental psychology is a great big area of psychology from prenatal and natal and then what they call oral and anal and phallic and latency and all of that kind of stuff. And it's around the age of 2 where the child gets some independence. And as that child gets independence onwards, especially if there's a sibling born, the older child— let's say the 3 or the 4-year-old— is mommy's little baby until the second baby is born. And now the older child is mommy's little helper. He's put to work. And certainly by the age of 6, the child is to put to work. You learn your ABCs, you learn your 1, 2, 3s, you do your homework, you sit here and pay attention in class. You've got work to do. All right. This means then that the mom changes her attitude from the child of being nurturing into being critical. And every child goes through that transitional phase badly. You could almost say that that is possibly the number one trauma in everyone's life is the transition of losing the love, losing the nurturing from our mommy. And Mommy now puts us to work, and we resent it, and we want to go back to and long for that state of nurturing. And so we expect to find it in the mate, right? Well, if you don't nurture your mate, your mate's not going to nurture you because she came to you for nurturing and you went to her for nurturing, and neither one of you got nurturing. Both of you have a critical mind. And so what we need to do is to convert that critical mind, that Samskara, or that built-up stuff of here's the rules, this is the way you're supposed to do things, all of those rites, rituals, rules, and all of that kind of stuff. We need to drop that and go back into nurturing ourselves. And don't make that a rule too. Thou shalt

**Speaker B:** Yeah, for real.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, actually just enjoy doing it rather than making it a rule.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Or worse still, oh, you're not nurturing yourself right now, you're a bad person. Yeah, even, even have the idea of nurturing and still stay in critical mind. This is exactly what we need to do with the very first point of meditation. The very first thing that Goenka says is that if the mind wanders away from the breath, never mind, start again. Okay, well, people don't do that, right? Congratulations for noticing the mind went away from the breath. Nourish the mind for the Sati that you've just got to see that the mind has wandered away. But the students don't they don't do that, instead they beat themselves up figuratively because they were out of control, "You didn't follow the rules." The rules is watch the breath, "You didn't follow the rules," slap, slap, slap, slap, and we go around beating ourselves up for no reason at all, when in fact this should be a point in time for congratulations and nourishment. "Ah, I remembered to watch the breath, well I'll go back and watch the breath."

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and there's kind of like an insistence on that congratulations, right? An insistence on having that attitude about it.

**Speaker A:** Well, insistence would be another rule.

**Speaker B:** Well, as an attitude.

**Speaker A:** Well, yes. Now the attitude of nurturing, to come out of our mind of critical thinking into the mind of nurturing. Okay, everything's all right.

**Speaker B:** So can I ask a question?

**Speaker A:** Sure.

**Speaker B:** So you know how, like, yeah, so, um, for the past few days and for like the past few weeks really, what we've been doing is you've said how important it is to notice the unwholesome thoughts and wake up to them and replace them with wholesome, because if you don't that adrenaline is just going to drip through, right? Cause that brain chemistry to go downward spiral.

**Speaker A:** So you ought to be watching your breath causes adrenaline rather than, oh yeah, the Kamma, Dharma, and that reduces adrenaline.

**Speaker B:** So what I was going to ask though is like, if I'm throwing out the rules, right? One of the rules that I would throw out is that every time I see an unwholesome thought that I have to like deliberately replace it with a wholesome thought. And instead, I would just like to be like, oh, oh, there that is. I can just relax. That's fine.

**Speaker A:** There you are. I see you, Mara. Or as we're saying, hello darkness, my old friend.

**Speaker B:** No, but what I'm saying is— no, listen to me.

**Speaker A:** It's your attitude about the unwholesome thought. Instead of making a rule about, oh, that's an unwholesome thought, you got to get it out.

**Speaker B:** No, I understand.

**Speaker A:** It's the attitude with it too. Yeah, the attitude is, okay, I see that everything is all right. I know, I'm satisfied with being able to see the unwholesome thought.

**Speaker B:** What I'm saying is, is it possible to sometimes just— are you getting frustrated?

**Speaker A:** It's that you get insistent upon that you have to tell rather than listening, because I've already answered your question several times, but you keep insisting, no, you got to hear it exactly the way I want to say it. But you're also going to just hear the same result. Back again. It's almost like that you've got a rule inside saying, I've got to get it out, I've got to tell it all.

**Speaker B:** I feel like you're not really listening to exactly what I'm asking, and you're asking— you're giving an answer.

**Speaker A:** You'd be satisfied with that? You're giving an answer that I'm not listening to you because I've heard all of that stuff before, and, and you're going to be really hard to pin down.

**Speaker B:** No, but this is different because we're talking about breaking— we're talking about, um, throwing out the rules, and you just keep cutting me off.

**Speaker A:** Okay, can you be satisfied that I keep cutting you off? No. Okay, we'll see that too. Because in fact, that's my job, is to cut you off from all of that stuff and come back to that. If I can't cut you off, how in the world can you expect you to cut that stuff off?

**Speaker B:** I know, but we're not going to be talking tomorrow, and I'm, I'm trying to ask you a question about something that happens in real time when I'm not talking to you, and I want to be able to address it and be able to deal with it in a way that's skillful, right?

**Speaker A:** Stop, stop that. That's just more, that's just more parent ego state, or more rule-setting, or trying to get it done in advance. I want to know now what to do tomorrow. That was just what you were asking.

**Speaker B:** That's not really fair because I— you're not real— like, you didn't let me ask my question. You keep cutting me off.

**Speaker A:** All right, go ahead and ask your question. I will be quiet and listen. Okay, ask your question.

**Speaker B:** Okay, if my intention— but I will

**Speaker A:** listen to the words. So you listen to as you're speaking them, you choose the correct words.

**Speaker B:** Okay. All right. If my intention is to drop the rules, right, to let go of the rules, one way how I see that playing out for me and how I've seen it play out over the past couple days, but I haven't given myself full permission to do this. Which is when I notice an unwholesome thought, instead of, you know, doing that whole dialogue of, oh, I see you, congratulations, success, I'll just take a breath now, replace this with a wholesome thought. Instead of doing that, I could just see it like a blip on the radar, like, oh, there's that. I'm just gonna enjoy this moment, or I'm just gonna enjoy this breath. Or I'm just going to enjoy this Piti or this Sukkha. Is that correct? Is that right? The right kind of attitude with letting go of the rules?

**Speaker A:** Okay. I've already said that 14 or 15 times and you didn't listen because you were too interested in asking your question.

**Speaker B:** You didn't say that. No, you didn't.

**Speaker A:** Well, you weren't listening.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right. Because you were too busy getting ready to ask your question.

**Speaker B:** I disagree, but that's fine.

**Speaker A:** I know. Go back to what Dan said, and that is find a little bit of Sukkha, find a little satisfaction. Keep going for finding satisfaction. Keep nourishing yourself because that's a satisfying thing to do.

**Speaker B:** It has nothing to do with my question though, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** It has— that's the— that's because your question is irrelevant. Drop your question. You don't need to ask a question. That in fact what you can say instead is, is that look at the fact that you still have doubt, and doubt is expressed in questions, and your questions and your questions and your questions and your questions, right? Let's put those aside. Let's put away all of the questions and just relax.

**Speaker B:** I guess what I don't want to have happen is for me to not notice an unwholesome thought because I'm relaxing right now, and then I end up having adrenaline go through and it was undetected. And then now I'm dealing with a downward spiral that I didn't see coming.

**Speaker A:** All right, I'm also dealing with it when it happens instead of worrying about it in advance. Okay.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** And if you're nourishing yourself, then that won't happen. And if you're worried about it happening, guess what? It will.

**Speaker B:** Okay. All right.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Anything that can go wrong will go wrong, and it will go wrong if you think about it going wrong. You create your own reality. Yeah. And you're trying to make sure that you get it right. And that's the rule. Don't worry about getting it right, just enjoy. Remember, it is okay. Everything's all right, everything's fine. When you see an unwholesome thought— aha, I see you as an unwholesome thought. If a thought is unwholesome and you do not see it You will. And if it's got you, perhaps after it's got you by the throat.

**Speaker B:** And if it's unwholesome and I do see it, but I don't go into that whole like, oh, I see you, that's okay too. And I can just enjoy.

**Speaker A:** The important thing is, is that you don't go into, oh no, there it is again, right? I'm worried about it.

**Speaker B:** Okay. Okay, good.

**Speaker A:** That in fact, a way of thinking about it is, is the gladdening of the mind. You've changed that into a rule rather than a pleasant thing to do. It's quite possible for people to say thou shalt nurture You must nurture. And every time I catch you not nurturing, I'm going to beat the tar out of you.

**Speaker B:** That's true. However, that's also still a victory in its own regard, right? Because for all these years, if you let it be— no, I mean, even the rule itself, the fact that I've made that a rule for myself, is a much more wholesome rule than the rule of shitting on myself or sabotaging myself. You know, it's a rule, but it's

**Speaker A:** more on yourself and sabotage on yourself. Now you're just doing it a little bit less, where in fact you don't have to do it at all. You just nurture yourself instead.

**Speaker B:** Right, right. I was just pointing to that. It's a victory.

**Speaker A:** I know. All right, okay, then, then take that as a victory.

**Speaker B:** I am.

**Speaker A:** And take that as a victory rather than as, oh no, what if this happens? This is just, you know, more— your questions are all about just more and more of what-whataboutisms, and there's no end to them. As you can tell, you can always come up with another question. Rather than being satisfied without the answers, because you've got enough. You've got enough. Enough what? Enough information or enough knowledge that you can feel good. And so go ahead and feel good. You don't have to have all the answers,

**Speaker B:** okay?

**Speaker A:** Because there's no end to the questions.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** so what we can do is just stop asking questions and just relax, not knowing. But if you have that rule, you should know everything, then that leads to more questions and more questions and more questions. In yourself.

**Speaker B:** I see those come out, uh, come up a lot throughout the day too, those kinds of thoughts.

**Speaker A:** I know, I see them often when we talk.

**Speaker B:** But it's good that I see them.

**Speaker A:** It's good, it's good that you see them. It's good that you begin to see these judgmental thoughts and the doubts and the worries about the future. When— if you can see it this way, if you can smile and relax and enjoy this present moment, yeah, then for sure you can do it again sometime, right? And that's all the knowledge you need, is that you can do it again. You got yourself into a good state this time. You can get yourself into a good state next time.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And you got yourself into a good state this time by nourishing, so continue that nourishing. Everything's all right, everything's fine. No place to go, nothing to do. Wow, what a relief it is. Hey, you know, there's an old Alka-Seltzer commercial that is useful. When they— it's a little, uh, jingle they call it: plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh, what a relief it is. Okay, and so we can think of that as a practice of Anapanasati. Is plop yourself down and plop away all of those, uh, just let all of those, uh, unwholesome thoughts go and allow that bubbling, relaxing fizzing. Oh, what a relief it is.

**Speaker B:** That's— I do that throughout the day.

**Speaker A:** I do. That's fine. That's it. All you have to do is continue to remember to do that. There's nothing left. There's nothing else to do.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and I am— so like, if putting my attention on the breath and enjoying the breath is okay to do that for long periods of time?

**Speaker A:** And it's a practice that builds up Sati.

**Speaker B:** That really helps me. Yeah, it really helps. It definitely makes the unwholesome thoughts seem less substantial. Too, because you have this great joyful sea of Sati, and then, you know, you have like a flicker of unwholesome.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's right. And so now that's the attitude. Hey, I can handle that.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, come and join me. Come and join me in my joy.

**Speaker A:** So, um, Beginning to see the questioning

**Speaker B:** mind,

**Speaker A:** okay, is built in with that standards of you got to get it right, you got to get everything done so that you'll know what to do. Yeah, so you got to keep— got to get these questions out, right? Yeah. And like I said, there's no end to the doubt, there's no end to the questions, and the practice is actually quite There's really nothing to it. That's a Buddhist joke, by the way.

**Speaker B:** I get it. Nothing to it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, there's nothing to it. It's easy. It's not hard.

**Speaker B:** It is easy.

**Speaker A:** It's not a struggle.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it's not.

**Speaker A:** But when we set standards, the standards and meeting the standards, that becomes a struggle.

**Speaker B:** That becomes the struggle. Yeah. You kind of got to notice that you're setting those standards first before you can see them. It's good. It's crazy because I feel like for the past few weeks, I've just been building up all this great Sati, but I've been doing it with these rules that I put in place. But now those rules have helped me win and get success to a degree and help me experience what it is to actually feel Sati and feel good. But now I can let them go.

**Speaker A:** Congratulations, you can see them now as a darkness, but they're still an old friend. Look how far they've gotten you.

**Speaker B:** Oh, good point. Yeah, it's like it's a new form of dissatisfaction now. The rules that I made for myself to be more wholesome. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So it's time to— Wow.

**Speaker B:** Congratulations.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, exactly. A new form of transportation. Let's say that a guy in England decides that he wants to climb Mount Everest. Okay, right. So the first thing he does is get on an airplane and winds up in Nepal. Okay, then he has to take a taxi up to a place, but eventually has to get out of the taxi and hoof it.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** All right. All right. So that means that there are stages to everything in travel. There's also stages in the practice of meditation, and that following the rules, the new rules, is the first step to stop using the old rules and start using the new rules. But then while they get mixed in together, And so now we have to begin to understand, no, there's a correct way to practice without the rules. Because now we're not doing it with critical mind, we're doing it with nurturing. We're not yammering anymore, we're just relaxing.

**Speaker B:** This is what Dan means when he says like one thorn to pull out another thorn. So the nurturing will probably eventually become what the rules are now, something to let go of.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, well, uh, a mommy when she's taking care of the baby doesn't set any rules for the baby at all. That's the point. Nurturing is no rules.

**Speaker B:** No rules. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Now nurturing is anything that the baby wants, that's okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And eventually the nurturing will go too.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, but the nurturing will go away also. But let us not have the nurturing replaced with criticism.

**Speaker B:** Right, right.

**Speaker A:** That when the nurturing goes away, there's nothing left.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Yeah. No, no. There's nothing that the baby wants, right?

**Speaker A:** The baby's got all the nourishment. That he needs right now. Always in the moment. In this moment, we can come to the place where we're just satisfied. Everything's okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so first it starts out with rules, then it starts out with nurturing, and then nothing. I see, I see.

**Speaker A:** Cool. Other than perhaps that, that third stage would be just keeping an eye on it to make sure that one thought after another is one wholesome thought after another, after another. And so there's the stage of going into a watchful place, just watching, just noticing. That's the, the next place to go because we want to stay there because it's very dangerous to go back to the rules. Yeah, so first we nurture it and then eventually we come down to just watch, just watch. And what are we watching? Basically we're watching to make sure that we're watching.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that we're watching. And then after a while it doesn't matter what channel we're on. You're satisfied with whatever it is, right?

**Speaker A:** Precisely. And so we can just forget about all those questions and getting it right. It's just, it's really easy to do if we remember to do it.

**Speaker B:** And I imagine another rule, an invisible rule in there, could be that I need to nurture now so that I can enjoy watching later. But maybe not. Maybe any combination of those could happen at any moment.

**Speaker A:** That's right. That this is all process-oriented with no goals in mind, right? That can you enjoy this present moment? Yeah, right up to the last one. No goals. Just enjoy. Just enjoy the moment. Everything's all right, everything's fine. Let's watch though, pay attention. Just keep going, keep noticing, because otherwise if we forget, then we'll fall back into the habits. Now over time, the habits themselves get weaker and weaker and weaker, right? And the new habit is watching. So that becomes easier and easier and easier. That's the habit now is just paying attention to what's going on.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And also like, like refocusing to being wholesome. That's a big habit change for me, for sure. For sure. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So one of the ways that I work with that is I've got a game that I play with the dogs. The dogs don't know the game, but they play the game instinctually anyway. Okay, dogs are very territorial. Anything or anyone or any other animal that comes into their territory, they have something to say about it, right? And so they're kind of on alert. Even when the dogs are laying there, they've got an ear open. All right, guarding your territory. So my little game sitting here on the porch is, is that I'm going to be a better dog than the dogs. I'm going to know when somebody comes before the dogs do. In other words, can I be here now so that the dogs, uh, are, um, they're doing their job and they're going to wake up? The question is Am I going to wake up too, to be in the present moment, which includes being in the senses? And that I've actually got an advantage over the dogs because out of the corner of the left eye, I could see any movement on the road. And so one of the parts of that game is who's coming. And that generally when Tam is coming home, I can— if I'm alert, I'll know that she's coming before her vehicle, either the motorbike or the truck, comes around the bend. Before she comes around the bend, I'll know she's there. And so I'll wait. Yep, there she is. Finally. 5 seconds, 3 seconds. That's, that's it. That's the game to play, is to be alert so that when things happen, I'll know it, because I've got nothing else to do. I'm just sitting here on the porch with no place to go and nothing to do except just to watch what's going on. Okay, so this is the way that we're thinking about it, is, is that, yeah, we're going to stay on guard. But that's the new habit. The new habit is to stay out of the mind and into the senses.

**Speaker B:** Into the senses. Like the whole, like, feeling of, like, being in a body, right?

**Speaker A:** To actually be here now means that you are in the body and you're using the body's eyes and ears and touch sensations and tactile Feeling the wind, feeling the sunshine. It's a brilliant— very rarely, in fact, only at certain times of year is there a place in the trees that the sun will come through that'll shine directly on. Mostly we can go all day without hitting any direct sunlight, but in January and February at about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, there's a lot of sun right in the face. How would I know that if I had not been observing and watching and paying attention? So watching the sun as it goes across the sky, I know at sunset that sometimes of the year it sets over here, and sometimes of the year it sets over there, because we're just just watching what's going on. And so this is, uh, this is what the ancients did. They didn't have books to read, they didn't have television to watch, they didn't have a whole lot of arguments to have, they didn't have a society to run, they didn't have political parties. There was nothing much to do except watch what was going on. And somehow so much has started to happen with our society being so complex that we feel like we got to get ready for it in advance rather than being able to handle it as it happens. And so that's part of the rules. Oh, you got to get ready. Oh, you got to know all the rules. You got to do everything in advance so that when it happens, you'll know how to do it.

**Speaker B:** Right, right.

**Speaker A:** And what we're doing is developing an attitude rather than a set of rules. And the attitude is, I can handle it without the rules. I don't have to be ready in the sense of a performance and getting it done right. I'm ready in the sense that it doesn't matter what happens, I can handle my feelings. Yeah, how I feel about it is actually what's the important thing. And people think that, oh, if it works the way that I want to, I'll feel good, and if it doesn't work out the way that I want to, I'll feel bad. Therefore, I got to make sure that it works the way that I want it to.

**Speaker B:** Exactly, exactly.

**Speaker A:** But the new attitude is, is that, oh, I can handle it and feel good, and it doesn't matter what it is that happens.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, it doesn't need to work out in any particular way.

**Speaker A:** It doesn't need to work out in any particular way. It's just working out the way that it works out.

**Speaker B:** And then ironically, when you're really in that state that it doesn't need to work out in any particular way, it works out pretty well.

**Speaker A:** It works out pretty well. Yeah, yeah,

**Speaker B:** it does. Yeah. Wow.

**Speaker A:** And so that means that we begin to use everything, even our environment, as a toy, playing little games with the dog.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. I came— Abby, when she came home today, she didn't want to talk, and it like really surprised me because the night before we were talking about breaking up. So I was like scared. I went to take a walk. And I just, while I was taking a walk, I just, I created a whole attitude shift. I was like, you know what, I'm gonna go out, I'm gonna get ice cream for us, I'm gonna surprise her. So I came home and I like, I did a whole song walking into the room with some ice cream, and I saw like, I could see the smile from her lips get wider and wider and wider.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. And she was like, that's a game to play.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. And from that From that moment on, we had an enjoyable evening. It's incredible. Like, it's amazing what that does.

**Speaker A:** Well, if you keep coming out with some Anapanasati ice cream on a regular basis, she's not going to think so much about breaking up.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, ice cream. I see what you did there. I'm helping build her skill of remembering how great it is to be with me.

**Speaker A:** Yes, exactly.

**Speaker B:** That's great. Yeah. And it's a joy too, to watch her change in front of me.

**Speaker A:** That's the joy that I have with the students, of watching you guys go through your stuff. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Nice.

**Speaker A:** It's very joyful to watch that. Been there, done that.

**Speaker B:** Well, we still didn't get to talk about the Paticcasamuppada, but I know we will.

**Speaker A:** We will. Yes, we will. So let's finish this call.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** And let you go back to understand, uh, now with the newfound understanding that you don't have to follow the rules, you don't have to set standards for yourself, you could just relax and enjoy.

**Speaker B:** I can just feel good right now.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, and just feel good. Yeah, that's the whole thing. You have permission to be okay, but you have to remember that you have permission to be okay. Otherwise, all the rules are going to come back in saying, oh, you're not doing this, you're not doing that, you got to get this right, and all of that kind of stuff. Yeah, but now that you can have Sati and say, oh yeah, I see that stuff, but I don't need it, I could be okay.

**Speaker B:** And just to like clarify, Dhammarato, if I'm not feeling like that really intense joy, that, that's okay.

**Speaker A:** That's okay. Yeah, we're looking for satisfaction.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we're not.

**Speaker A:** But in fact, if you keep going back to the satisfaction, that joy will come back. Yeah, but you got to get the satisfaction again. Yeah. Okay, stop setting rules that you got to do this, that, and the other thing and have joy big. No, the only thing that we got on our list is nurturing satisfaction.

**Speaker B:** Nurturing and satisfaction. Okay, so two rules now.

**Speaker A:** Well, down to two rules is better than 10,000.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** because in fact we could go down to say really this just one rule. That's the only— yeah. Let it go.

**Speaker B:** I like what you said about nurturing and satisfaction. No, I'll let that carry me.

**Speaker A:** Thank you. All right, all right.

**Speaker B:** Thanks, Dhammarato. Okay, bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** You notice it is raining really hard right now?

**Speaker B:** Oh no, I don't see any rain.

**Speaker A:** Oh no, it's really, really coming down.

**Speaker B:** Oh, I see it on your roof. Yeah. Oh, that's so nice. I love listening to the rain. It's so nice.

**Speaker A:** I'm surprised that the microphone is so good that it blocks all of that out. You can't hear it.

**Speaker B:** It does.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. For me, it's all deafening.

**Speaker B:** Do you like the sound of the rain? You enjoy it?

**Speaker A:** Yes, but not during a conversation. Like, yes, I enjoy going to a disco, but not when somebody wants to talk.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I know, right?

**Speaker A:** Because I can't hear anything anybody says. All right, well, we see you.

**Speaker B:** Okay, bye, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A) with a student (Speaker B), centers on moving from a rigid, rule-based meditation practice to one of gentle nurturing and present-moment satisfaction. Here is a summary of the key themes and instructions:

### **Core Teaching: From Rules to Nurturing**
The student reports progress—even on a difficult "ditch" day, they continued practicing by discarding unwholesome thoughts, smiling, and breathing. However, Dhammarato identifies that the student is still approaching practice with a **goal-oriented, rule-bound mindset** (e.g., "I *have to* notice unwholesome thoughts, I *have to* replace them, I *have to* smile"). This creates struggle and a pass/fail dynamic.

The central instruction is to **drop the self-imposed rules and standards** and shift to an attitude of **nurturing and satisfaction**. The practice isn't about "getting it right" but about learning to be okay in the present moment.

### **Key Points and Instructions**

1.  **Lower Your Standards:** The student's habit of being "bossy" with themselves comes from internalized high standards. The remedy is to **lower the standard of what is "good enough"** to the point that whatever you are doing right now is acceptable. Find the "smallest unit of win."

2.  **Nurture Yourself, Don't Command Yourself:** Instead of giving yourself orders ("I must watch the breath"), give yourself permission ("I *can* enjoy the breath now"). This shifts from a critical, parental ego state to a nourishing, maternal one. The metaphor used is a mother bonding with and nurturing her infant—a rule-free, loving attention.

3.  **Process Over Result:** Stop being result-oriented (e.g., "I must achieve joy"). Be process-oriented, where the process itself—gentle awareness and nurturing—is the goal. The "result" is the okay-ness of this very moment.

4.  **The Role of Thoughts:** You don't always need a complex mental procedure to deal with unwholesome thoughts. While noticing and replacing them is a skill, the deeper shift is in your **attitude** toward them. See them, acknowledge them ("Hello darkness, my old friend"), and then gently return to nurturing satisfaction without self-criticism.

5.  **Stages of Practice (Using Thorns to Remove Thorns):**
    *   **Stage 1 (Rules):** Initially, wholesome rules (like replacing negative thoughts) are needed to counteract deeply ingrained unwholesome habits.
    *   **Stage 2 (Nurturing):** Once the wholesome habit is built, you let go of the rules themselves and practice from a place of gentle nurturing and self-acceptance.
    *   **Stage 3 (Simple Watching):** Eventually, this settles into a calm, alert "just watching"—a satisfied abiding in the present moment without needing to *do* anything.

6.  **Cultivate Satisfaction (*Sukkha*):** The primary aim is to find and nurture a sense of satisfaction in the present. If you cultivate this, joy (*piti*) will arise naturally. Don't make joy a target; make present-moment satisfaction your home base.

7.  **Answering Doubts and Questions:** Dhammarato points out that the student's incessant questions are an expression of doubt and the "got to get it right" mentality. The instruction is to **put the questions aside** and relax into not knowing. You already have enough knowledge to feel good now; endless questioning is a trap.

### **Practical Outcomes**
The student realizes that their self-imposed rules were a necessary training wheel to experience mindfulness (*sati*) and joy, but now they can let those rules go. They share a real-life example: when faced with a tense moment with their partner, they dropped their worry, shifted their attitude, and created a joyful connection—demonstrating how the practice works off the cushion.

### **Conclusion**
Dhammarato's final guidance is to **remember you have permission to be okay**. The entire practice boils down to nurturing a sense of satisfaction in the here and now, letting go of the struggle, and watching the mind with a gentle, alert presence. The ultimate attitude is: "Everything's all right, everything's fine. No place to go, nothing to do."

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the dialogue, the speakers use a rich tapestry of metaphors and stories to illustrate the challenges and insights of their meditation practice. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Primary Metaphors & Analogies**

1.  **The Ditch:** Represents states of low mood, struggle, or "Dukkha" (suffering/discontent). The depth and duration of being in the "ditch" are used to measure progress.
    *   *Example:* "the depth of being in that ditch has changed... I noticed... is like being in the ditch, but I didn't stop practicing."

2.  **The Mountain Climb:** Symbolizes a difficult task or challenge that requires effort.
    *   *Example:* "it was a little bit more of like a tougher climb up the mountain, but I did it."

3.  **Jousting / Battle Gear:** Represents framing practice as a struggle or conflict.
    *   *Example:* "like a, uh, a joust?... with lances and horses and battle gear... That's a challenge."

4.  **Training Wheels on a Bicycle:** Illustrates how initial rules and structures in practice are necessary for beginners but must eventually be discarded to advance.
    *   *Example:* "Very much like training wheels on a bicycle... your Grand Prix sprinter... will lose the race if he's got training wheels."

5.  **Creating New Neurons / The Long Game:** A neuroscientific metaphor for the slow, physical process of rewiring the brain through consistent practice.
    *   *Example:* "you're like, literally creating new neurons in the brain, that takes some time. So remember, you're in the long game."

6.  **The Treadmill:** Represents futile effort—moving with great energy but not making real progress.
    *   *Example:* "Still on the same treadmill of looking at Dukkha rather than... throw it out."

7.  **The Radar Blip:** Describes observing unwholesome thoughts as passing, insignificant events rather than engaging with them.
    *   *Example:* "I could just see it like a blip on the radar."

8.  **A Joyful Sea vs. a Flicker:** Contrasts a sustained state of joyful awareness ("Sati") with transient negative thoughts.
    *   *Example:* "you have this great joyful sea of Sati, and then... you have like a flicker of unwholesome."

9.  **One Thorn to Remove Another:** (Attributed to Dan) The idea of using a skillful means (like a rule) to remove an unskillful habit, knowing both will eventually be discarded.
    *   *Example:* "one thorn to pull out another thorn. So the nurturing will probably eventually become... something to let go of."

10. **The Alert Dog / Guarding the Territory:** A game of mindful presence, being more alert than even a watchful dog to one's environment and inner state.
    *   *Example:* "I'm going to be a better dog than the dogs. I'm going to know when somebody comes before the dogs do."

### **Stories & Extended Analogies**

1.  **The Mother and Child Bonding & Nurturing:**
    *   This is a **central story** used to explain the shift from a critical, rule-bound mind to a nurturing attitude.
    *   It describes the natural, rule-free nurturing of an infant, the traumatic shift when a parent becomes critical and demanding (linking to societal training and "putting to work"), and the subsequent lifelong search for that lost nurturing in external places like relationships.
    *   The moral is that the practitioner must learn to **become the nurturing parent to themselves**, replacing inner criticism with unconditional nourishment.

2.  **The Journey to Mount Everest:**
    *   Illustrates the **stages of practice**. Different vehicles (plane, taxi, walking) are needed for different parts of the journey. Similarly, one uses different tools (rules, nurturing, simple watching) at different stages, knowing when to discard the old vehicle for the new one.
    *   *Example:* "following the rules, the new rules, is the first step... like taking a taxi... but eventually has to get out of the taxi and hoof it."

3.  **The Ice Cream Surprise:**
    *   A **personal anecdote** from Speaker B that demonstrates the practical application of the "nurturing attitude." Instead of reacting to a partner's coldness with fear or rules, he spontaneously creates a joyful, connecting moment (buying ice cream), which shifts the entire dynamic. This is presented as "Anapanasati ice cream" – applying mindful joy outwardly.

### **Cultural References & Snippets (Used as Metaphorical Anchors)**

*   **"Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't":** A jingle used to normalize fluctuating states of mind, arguing they don't have to be "challenges."
*   **"Looking for love in all the wrong places":** The song is interpreted as seeking satisfaction (love/fulfillment) externally rather than cultivating it internally.
*   **"Plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh what a relief it is":** An Alka-Seltzer commercial jingle repurposed as a metaphor for the meditation process—letting tensions dissolve ("plop") and experiencing the relief ("fizz") of relaxation.
*   **"Hello darkness, my old friend":** A line from Simon & Garfunkel's "The Sound of Silence" used to represent acknowledging unwholesome thoughts with familiarity and without alarm.

### **Core Conceptual Metaphors**
*   **Practice as Skill-Building:** "we're developing a skill."
*   **Mind as a Wobbly Object Needing Steadiness:** The hand-shaking demonstration (wobbly vs. steady vs. perfectly still) to contrast a distracted mind, a settling mind, and a deeply concentrated mind.
*   **Standards/Boundaries as Adjustable:** The idea of "lowering your standards" or "boundaries" below your current state so that you are always "above standard" and thus "good enough."

**In summary**, the talk uses metaphors of **journeys, struggles, nurturing, and skill-building** to contrast an old, goal-oriented, self-critical mode of practice with a new, process-oriented, self-nurturing mode. The stories of **child development** and the **Everest climb** provide frameworks for understanding this transition, while everyday analogies like **training wheels, radar blips, and watchful dogs** make the insights tangible.
