### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Go ahead. What's your question?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, in Anapanasati Sutta, the Buddha says that breathing meditation fulfills the four foundations of awareness, which I understand. And then he says that the four foundations of awareness also fulfill the seven links to awakening. So how are the seven links to awakening fulfilled? Fulfilled in this way?

**Speaker A:** Okay, that's actually a very beautiful question. I have different terminology, and that is that we practice Anapanasati for the fulfillment of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, and that we practice the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, the Satipatthana, for the fulfillment of the Sambojhana. The Seven Factors of Awakening. Okay. And that we practice the Seven Factors of Awakening for the fulfillment of knowledge and deliverance. And this little phrase that I've said is actually four times in the Anapanasati Sutta. That's how important it is. I guess you've read the sutta. You understand that. Why did he go through this? Okay. Well, let's look at it in the sense that we're starting Anapanasati from the foundation of the actual deep teachings of the Buddha, which is Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha, broken into the Four Noble Truths of Dukkha does exist, the cause of Dukkha is greed, ill will, and mostly ignorance, followed by the Third Noble Truth which people don't spend much time thinking about, talking about, or lecturing about, which is basically the state of feeling in a state like that. You've got no problem, you've got no difficulties, you've got no Dukkha. And then there is the Eightfold Noble Path. And the Eightfold Noble Path is to be practiced in order to get one's mind in the state of freedom from Dukkha. That's the whole practice right there. Where does Anapanasati come in? Anapanasati comes into the position of that is the way to actually practice the Eightfold Noble Path. Most specifically, it has to do with all 8 of them, but one of them Hang on a second. The Eightfold Noble Path then is what we— that's the intended method, and that Anapanasati is nothing but the application of that. That in fact at one point, not just one point, I think that it was kind of common because I had heard it right out of his own mouth, but it seems that it's made it into the literature also in at least some places where Bhikkhu Buddhadasa said that the Buddha actually only taught one practice. Now we can call that meditation if you want to, but in the in the sutta is called the Anapanasati. Okay, that the Buddha only gave one method of practice for the Eightfold Noble Path, and that was Anapanasati. And that he does the Anapanasati for the fulfillment of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, which is getting in touch with waking up and being here now with the body, being in touch with waking up and being in the here and now with the feelings, being in touch with, expecting, examining, and seeing what's going on in the mind in this very moment, and relaxing and focusing the mind and allowing it to become unified. This is all in the Anapanasati Sutta. And then once we get there, then we do the fourth tetrad, which is actually, if you want to look at it correctly. That's the noting that's done in the Mahasi Method, but it's only done when the mind is actually in a wholesome state, to where only students begin the Mahasi Method by noting whatever there is. And whatever there is, sometimes and quite often, is unwholesome. Okay, but that's— let's leave that part of the practice there. But to know that the Anapanasati does have these four items that need to be practiced, and we practice all of them kind of all at the same time until we get really, really good at the first three, and then we spend more and more time in the fourth tetrad. And that the hallmark of the fourth tetrad is to see both the arising and the falling away and the detachment and the letting go of it. And we can actually practice that right there in that out-breath. The in-breath comes in, Anicca, and then the out-breath is fading away, the end of the out-breath is complete extinction, and the letting go is the silence that's left for a mind moment or two, or a second or two, and then we start the cycle over again. So, even the Four Tetrads is there from the beginning, but we spend more and more emphasis upon it as we have gained really strong skills in the first three, so that we're now practicing the Satipatthana. The Satipatthana Sutta, which is number 10, and number 118 is the companion. And you could also say, well, wait a minute, we're doing the Eightfold Noble Path, and the Eightfold Noble Path actually is 117. So 117, 118, and 10 suttas can be used together to understand how the practice is done. If we spend all of our time reading only the Satipatthana Sutta, it gets kind of confusing. But when we see all three suttas together, we can really understand this sequence of events, because in fact both the Eightfold Noble Path and the Sambhojana are mentioned in the Ten Sutta number 10, the Satipatthana Sutta, but they are there in the fourth tetrad, and they're there as examples of wholesome thoughts. But also in the fourth tetrad of the Satipatthana Sutta are the hindrances. To be deleted. Okay, the hindrances are to be deleted, and that's the first thing that we begin to do with the Four Tetrads, knowing what the mind's objects are. We begin to remove the hindrances and put only wholesome quality thoughts in.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so this is the practice, and that's why the Satipatthana and the Anapanasati Sutta are just deeply tied together. It's actually just one thing, they're just broken into two suttas to look at it from this direction and look at it from that direction, but it's really just one thing, one practice. But yet in the Anapanasati Sutta, hindrances are not mentioned. No. What is mentioned instead is gladdening the mind, which is actually the removal of the hindrances.

**Speaker B:** Hmm.

**Speaker A:** Hmm.

**Speaker B:** Hmm. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Also, the Eightfold Noble Path is not mentioned in the Anapanasati Sutta. Why is that? Because the Eightfold Noble Path is for the foundation and the Anapanasati Sutta is set up saying that we do Anapanasati, not what was the foundation, but what's the goal of Anapanasati is for the fulfillment of the Satipatthana. And we do that for the fulfillment of the Seven Factors of Enlightenment. So what's the relationship between the Seven Factors of Enlightenment and the Eightfold Noble Path? Basically, the best way to look at it is by saying that the Eightfold Noble Path is the skills that are to be developed using Anapanasati, and when you develop those skills, the outcome of the fulfillment of the Satipatthana is the fulfillment of the Seven Factors of Enlightenment, which are the Eightfold Noble Path in its fruition. Okay, so you can think of then, as the Eightfold Noble Path and the Sambhojana as one book, One of them is Chapter 1 and the other one is Chapter 31.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So the 7 factors of enlightenment are to be fulfilled as enlightenment factors. But if you look at each individual one, here's what you find. The first item on the list is unremitting mindfulness or Sati. Wait a minute, we have Anapanasati Sutta, and we have the Sati Patthana, the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, as well as now Sati is the first item on the list of the Seven Factors of Enlightenment. So, this spinning wheel of Sati, is one of the few points that are in all of these sutras about the practice, is basically to wake up and look at what you're doing, to literally come out of the sixth sense of dreamland, daydreams, imaginations, concepts, and come into reality. Basically, it's very much like in bed, the first thing that you do when you wake up in the morning What's the very first thing, the first second that you wake up, what do you do? What is it? Tell me about that first second.

**Speaker B:** Thinking what to do during the day.

**Speaker A:** No, that's too late. Before that. Huh? The very first thing you do in the morning when you wake up is you know that you're awake. You wake up. Isn't that right? Think about it now and think about it tomorrow morning. Notice when you wake up in the morning, the very first thing that happens.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, right.

**Speaker A:** Plan on it the night before so that you can verify for yourself that in fact the very first thing that we notice is that now we're awake. That's Sati, to wake up. Okay, which means literally to come into our senses. One of the ways that we wake up in the morning is the knowledge of the body. Okay, that would be like the second mind moment. The first is the Sati, and then the awareness of the body. You actually take a little inventory of what posture you're in, especially the arms and the head. You'll notice that whether you're on your side or on your back or whatever posture that you're in, that's the first thing that you'll notice. Okay, well, when we're practicing Anapanasati, we can do exactly the same thing. When we wake up, we notice the body. Also, when we wake up in normal practice— when I say normal practice, I'm talking about like all day long kind of practice, like when you're sitting there doing your dissertation and then Sati comes and you wake up Okay, then that means that that waking up moment, we begin, we see what the mind was doing. Okay, we could look at that too, just like when we woke up and saw the body posture. We could look up and see what the first thing that happens in the mind, or what's going on, often is kind of reverberation of the past couple of seconds, what was happening in the past couple of seconds. When we decided to apply Sati. That's what is step 9 of Anapanasati, which is the investigation of the mind. But that's also in the sutta 117, that point is what they call right noble view, in the sense of actually looking at something. Basically, you could say the distinction between ordinary view and right noble view is that ordinary view is built upon concepts, about how things should do, or we can call it the parent ego state. This is what all the ways that things ought to be, rights, rules, rituals, and our concepts. An example of that is when I use the word world. How big is your world?

**Speaker B:** Well, I think that's just that what's going on in the moment. And the other thing is what's going

**Speaker A:** on in your mind. Exactly. So Andromeda strings and Vladimir Putin's and Mardi Gras and all of that kind of stuff is not in the world. That's in mental concepts. Yeah, because I've never been to the Mardi Gras and neither have you. And so for both of us, it's just a concept. That's not part of our world.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Is this the world of the senses?

**Speaker B:** Is this what you just say, experiencing mental formating or mental formations in Anapanasati Sutta?

**Speaker A:** That's exactly what these mental formations are, is formating. I just formated a Bhikkhuni, I just formated an Arahant, I just formated a Mahayana.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. We can also think of these mental formations as junk thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** okay, listen, the Buddha had his language and we've got ours, but we're talking about the same thing. Mental formations, then, which is actually step 9 of— yeah, no, 9, 10, 11, step 11 of the Anapanasati. No, wait a minute. Mental formations, sorry. 8, step 8. 7. Because our mental formations— this is part of the— I got it finally. 7. Because in the Vedana you have Piti and Sukkha, 5 and 6, and then 7 of these mental formations, and then calming the mental formations. It's step 8.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. That's the mental formations. That's interesting that the mental formations are in the Vedana.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Why would mental formations be in the Vedana? Is because we feel our way through all of these thought systems rather than using wisdom, that you're not thinking with wisdom, you're not thinking with right noble view. You're thinking out of the Samskaras of the past.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so that's why we call them junk thoughts, because if you were thinking the kind of thoughts that you would want to be thinking, you'd be thinking really marvelous thoughts, and here you are thinking a bunch of junk.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. So what is the difference between experiencing mental formation? Thing or mental formations and experiencing mind. So I don't really get that.

**Speaker A:** I get that that's getting very close into being very similar to the same thing, isn't it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Basically what the formations are, are a little bit deeper. This is where we can go from the issue of the instantaneous thought into the underlying fetter. The hindrances have seeds that germinate. All right. So we're talking about the difference between seeds and full-blown things. So at this, at this seed level, that is why it's in the Vedana is because basically, let's, let's say it this way. The kind of thoughts that you're going to have if you have an attitude of being a loser versus the kind of thoughts that you're going to have if you have the attitude of a winner. In other words, two guys are in a prize fight and they— and the game is over and one wins and the other one is carried out. And now they're both in their separate rooms getting a massage, right? Are they going to be thinking the same things? Not a chance. Even if they're thinking about the same topic or the same person, maybe they got the same boss, they're going to be thinking about him differently. Okay. The thoughts are different based upon the mood that we're in. So basically what we're talking about now is right in the very beginning, we begin to look at just these thoughts that we're having. And then later, we, as we get more sophisticated, we begin to look at the formations of these mental states based upon what attitude that we have.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. Does that help that understand? Yeah, that's a good point.

**Speaker B:** So can you say that experiencing mind would be experiencing ill will or restlessness of the mind? And the mental formations is the effect of that? Let's say you have a restless mind.

**Speaker A:** No, actually, the mental formations would see the restlessness as restlessness.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** When we're guarding the mind or when we're noting what's in the mind, we're seeing the thought of this, then we see the thought of that, then we see the thought of the other thing, and then we put together at a deeper level. Look at the mind, how restless it is. Yeah, it's just all over the place, right? How do we know it's all over the place if we haven't seen it go here and then there and then this place and then that place and then this place? And then we say, wait a minute, I see that. Okay, not only did I see each thought, but I also saw the trail.

**Speaker B:** Yeah. Okay, now I understand. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay. So now we begin to see that restlessness is because we've had— and not only that, but it can also have a feeling component. But as that restlessness builds, it not only has the mind agitated, but it turns on a bit of adrenaline so that we can feel agitated, we could feel restless, or we can feel bored and humdrum. And so that's the time to take a break from those kind of feelings. We can wake up to that. Yeah, stand up, raise our arms, and says, well, I'm glad I saw that stuff, and here I was doing a dissertation instead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** so when we're doing it, we can feel really good about it only because we remember that we've got a choice about how we feel. But no one really knows that they've got a choice in as to how they feel, and still they actually start applying that choice. Your whole life, nobody's ever mentioned to you, because nobody ever knew that we actually have a control mechanism that can be developed. So that we can control our feelings. But in fact, when the feelings are controlled, only then are they actually ours. Only then, when they're controlled, are they brought into the real family and integrated into the mind. Otherwise, bad feelings that we don't want is keeping the mind unorganized, disunified. We're a crowd inside. With the parent yelling at the child and the child rebelling against it and the adult not paying any attention to what's going on. And so we remain a crowd. But when the adult is put into focus, put into gear, and starts seeing this internal dialogue, then you say, hot dog, I see you, Mara, I can see that stuff. And I can see not only does it affect the way that I think, it affects the way that I feel. And in fact, the feelings and the thoughts go hand in hand together. And when we see that, that point of awakening, that hot dog— I can see what's going on— that actually is the switch from being the victim of that stuff that's happening into being the champion. I'm the boss now. I just woke up. It's almost like Daddy's in bed asleep, and the kids are just all over the house getting into all kinds of things, looking in his pockets and whatnot. But when Daddy wakes up, the kids change. Okay, well, the same thing happened inside your own mind. Yeah, you've also heard it in the sense that when the cat's away, the mice will play. Not only will they play, do a lot of damage, and, and, and there's not so much playing at all,

**Speaker B:** all of those mice.

**Speaker A:** But when the cat The boss comes home, then all of that activity is put to a stop, basically. So that's the whole function of waking up. That's Sati. And if we wake up and wake up and wake up and wake up over and over and over again, then that begins to build a habit so that it becomes unremitting. Once the Sati comes up, Then that means that I remember now to wake up. I could wake up. You've heard the phrase wake up and smell the coffee. Yeah, the waking up we've got. We just covered that. The smelling of the coffee is actually now we're in sensory awareness. In fact, smelling the coffee is a big deep in-breath, isn't it?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So basically it's not the coffee, it's wake up and smell, or wake up and take in some air. Yeah, wake up and smell the coffee means to get into your sensory awareness or come to the here-now. So that's the first thing that we do is we wake up, and when we wake up now, we can actually take a look at that. Taking a look now is the investigation of one's right view, to look at what's going on. But the question is, how skilled are we at looking? Are we going to look only at this instantaneous thought, or are we going to look deeper down also? The answer to that is, that's a skill to be developed.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And some students are capable of, let us say, seeing anxiety quite quickly, and others it takes a while. But everybody begins to deal with anxiety. Why? Because they can see it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And the answer to it, whenever we see it, whether it's early or late into the practice, is always the same thing. Never mind, take a deep breath, change the way that we're thinking, because it was the thoughts that we were having that got us into the feeling of being agitated and worried. In fact, agitated and worried— worried about what? Those are the thoughts.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, put those to rest. Oh, I don't have to worry right now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So Now that we've got the first two items on the Satipatthana— excuse me, on the Samadhi— the next item on the list then is one's right effort turned on its head, or basically fully developed. When one's right effort is fully developed, it's no effort at all. It's almost energetic. It just pops into place. Yeah, this was also woken up, and as you were waking up, the wake-up actually has a deep breath built into it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so this was also the question I was having. What would be the difference between the energy linked to awakening and right effort? And you just stated that if you practice right effort over and over again, it becomes something you don't have to put effort, it just becomes an energetic thing.

**Speaker A:** Exactly.

**Speaker B:** Okay, okay.

**Speaker A:** Yes, it's— there's many examples of that. Uh, but any piece of wood, let's say a limb, if you bend that limb, it's going to resist and go back. If you bend it down again, it's going to resist and go back, but not quite as far as it went back into, or where it was in the beginning. It's going to have a residual little bit of bend in it. Okay, so you bend the thing again, you pop it back into place. Okay, you keep bending and you keep bending it, and more often and the whatnot, more often that you bend it, the more likely it is going to return to a place that's closer and closer to the bend and less likely to be up at the place where it used to be. That's actually the way that the instincts operate also, that you can in fact begin to bend them, but it takes a long time. It takes one wholesome thought after another wholesome thought after another wholesome thought that gets those feelings to actually really relax. But when you get good at it, you could do it pretty quickly. That's when it becomes energetic. We don't have to take the effort anymore.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So one's right effort, which is part of the Eightfold Noble Path, and one's right effort actually in the sutta, it says that we're going to use right effort to change our attitude as well as to change the thoughts. So we're going to change it on both levels. All right, so we're changing it on both levels means that we're going to change the instantaneous thoughts that we have, but we're going to also begin to change the underlying feelings. And by gladdening the mind, we're actually perking up our feelings. Instead of feeling afraid and anxious and uptight, We feel satisfied and content because we're practicing that. Yeah, then that old Anagami will whack back right into place, back into the old stuff, and we bend it again and say, come on guys, let's come down and let's be happy and content and fearless. Then it pops back up into the fear again, but it doesn't go quite as far the next time.

**Speaker B:** Yeah,

**Speaker A:** so this is how, uh, and you could do this within that 2-hour sitting period that we were talking about before of doing a task. Then sometimes you feel like an Arhat, sometimes you don't, and it'll go back and forth. If you're aware of that and you can recognize that you have grown tired or bored of the tasks that you're doing, take a break, get yourself back into a really good state, and then go back and do it again. And this is built right into the Anapanasati Sutta. Okay, so the next item on the list, that effort becomes really easier and easier and easier. The first time we bent that limb, a lot of work. But after bending it 1,000 times, not only is the arm getting a little bit stronger, but the limb itself is willing to bend. Yeah, done that before. Been there, done that. OK, so that's one's right effort. And when it's in the Eightfold Noble Path, it's effort. And when it becomes part of the Sambojana, it's unremitting energetic. It's just easy. Okay, the next item on the list is Piti-Sukkha, which means that it's really easy now to get ourselves into Piti-Sukkha. And Piti and Sukkha, which has been part of the development of getting ourselves feeling good. Now the Sambhojana means that you're just feeling good because it's effortless to feel good, because you're watching what you're doing, because you're Sati is in here. Okay, so you can see the sequence of events with this. There is an additional item that's added in the Samadhi Jhana, and that is tranquility. But that item is also in Anapanasati. It's the fourth step. And in some, or at least in one sutta that I know of, it adds the five items of the first Jhana. It adds that sixth item, which is the body is relaxed. And sure enough, if you've got the other 5 factors of the first Jhana, where you're sitting completely relaxed, then that's part of the Jhana. How can you be completely— how can the body become relaxed? Well, the body becomes relaxed because we have safety and security, comfort. The body is comfortable. We're not sitting on either pins or needles. And if we've been sitting in meditation too long and the body hurts, to adjust it. We're not here for endurance, we're here for comfort. So, when we develop these factors of Piti and Sukkha, through the practice of Anapanasati, and they become developed as skills, that means that the default position now is happiness, Dukkha and relaxation. Okay, so all of these things work together. And so now we have covered how many? I think we've gotten 5 of the 7. The next ones would be Upekkha and Samadhi. Well, Samatha here is the very Samadhi that is part of the practice of the Eightfold Noble Path, except now is unremitting rather than peaceful. Now the mind does no longer have any arguments. Now the mind is unified. Now this, uh, Upekkha, the way that I normally describe that is, um, talk about it in the sense of a dynamic balance, which it also can be thought of as sea legs. An example of that is that when the, uh, the big fishing boat is at port, anybody, all the landlubbers, the captain, and everybody can walk the plank or walk on the deck. But when that boat is out at sea, especially in high seas, the captain has sea legs. Even though the floor that he is under is wobbling and shaking, his sea legs are such that he can get from the front end of the boat to the back end of the boat without running into anything, encountering anything, or having any events. Where a landlubber who's never been on such a boat, when it's rolling around in the high seas, they're going to run into the cabin, they're going to run into the rigging, they're going to heave over the side, they may go over the side, all kinds of things because they don't have the sea legs. OK, back to Anapanasati now and recognize that everything is in turmoil except number 13, Anicca. Everything's changing. Things arise and they pass away and they arise and pass away. That's very similar then to that boat. The reality is, is that everything is in turmoil. Are you going to be able to have such a balance so that you can maintain your cool, even though the floor that's under you in reality, even though things don't go your way in town, they don't go your way at the visa office, they don't go your way at the dissertation, they don't go your way the way that you wanted it to go, but they're going their own way. The question is, is do you have the mental agility Do you have the training to maintain your balance even when things are not going the way that you thought that they would?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And when that becomes unremitting, that means that even if you fall down, you get right back up. Never mind. Yeah, I didn't see anything happen. Nobody fell. Okay, so this is the sea legs. This is, um, Upekkha. So the Sambojana, when we practice the Sambojana— actually not practice the Sambojana, the Sambojana comes together because of all of the other correct practice. This is actually then the fulfillment of all of the other skills that we were practicing. If we're practicing Sati and practicing Sati, it becomes unremitting. Now, what I mean by unremitting unremitting does not mean in Western mentality of all the time. But basically what we mean unremitting is, is that it's there when you need it. It's there when you need it because we've been practicing that, that it's there when we need it. In other words, if somebody asks you to play a song, you sit right down and play that song because you just practiced it and rehearsed Okay, so that's the way that we look at it, is the unremitting part means that you're ready at any time, not that you've got to be there all the time. That if something happens, you can remember that that's happened. Let's get our sea legs going, let's have our Upekkha. So you can see, in fact, all of these things are together. They're just different ways of describing, but basically what it is, is that you get to the position that, hey man, you can handle anything. Anything that comes by, you can be sharp enough and awake enough so that you can stand out of the way of those slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, especially since most of them come verbally anyway. And verbal errors are really easy to stand right out of the way. Who are you talking about? All right, so that's the Seven Factors of Enlightenment, and that we practice or that we fulfill the Seven Factors of Enlightenment, but we do it kind of in stages. And the two stages that the Buddha is talking about is basically knowledge and deliverance. These are two completely different things, and you could go so far as to say that the knowledge part is Srotapanna. The fruit of Srotapanna is the knowledge of how the mind works, the knowledge of Paticcasamuppada, the knowledge of the job that really needs to be done, and that is the deliverance from the defilements. That's the job, finally, that we've got to do. So that means then that the Sotapanna, Anagami, and Arahant each have various tasks to do, and that they come kind of in order, with greed and ill will being items number 4 and 5, which by the way, happen to be part of the Second Noble Truth anyway. But you have to have the knowledge to get rid of those things, because the that they happening was caused by ignorance. Once you get the knowledge, now we know we have the knowledge of ill will and greed, and we know that wanting things causes suffering, causes Dukkha. And so that's where we now practice to be finished with that stuff, that we sharpen that we've got, unremitting mindfulness. So when greed comes up in the mind, we say, I saw you, I got you that time. Okay, that's then the deliverance.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** All right, this knowledge and deliverance also can be thought of as two stages of enlightenment, that funny word that a Buddhist stole from the French Revolution. You know that word? The Enlightenment, which is nothing really but a war between science and religion. That's the Age of Enlightenment, is the waking up to testing things out, rather than believing we've heard before. So, that's OK to use a word like that, but in order to give it correct definition, so that we know what it means in Buddhism, because otherwise it's a kind of way up there, airy-fairy. Nobody knows what enlightenment is, but boy, does everybody want a bunch of it. Hmm. Rather than recognizing, well, it's not— it's a very specific skill. So you can think of this as the word enlightenment has a primary word, and that is light. The light then is also the same thing as knowledge. In the sense of turning lights on, daylight. I mean, many, many different— I've seen the light. All kinds of things have to do with turning on or putting some photons to work, has to do with knowledge. You can see what's going on. And so taking a look and having knowledge, that's the enlightenment. And then the second word of enlightenment is the enlightenment of not heavy. Not no longer heavy with burdens, that when we see the burdens with a knowledge, then we can release those burdens and set them down, let them go. Okay, that's the deliverance. It's not that those devices and those defilements own us and are controlling us. No, we're actually holding on to them and we didn't know it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so when we recognize with our knowledge what we are hanging on to that's painful, then— and we're talking about it in any particular moment or any particular group of moments— at that level we can see the hindrances very easily because we've gotten those things developed. Once we have that knowledge, the knowledge in fact would be the unremitting Sati. And so, that deliverance then winds up being that we can see that this needs to be delivered, we have unremitting investigation. And then, once we do that, dropping it is dead easy, no longer an effort. Because we're practiced to that point, once we see it, we drop it dead easy. And then we get a big kick out of that, Piti, Sukkha comes right immediately, followed by relaxation, followed by Upekkha, followed by

**Speaker B:** Samadhi,

**Speaker A:** Samatha, Noble Samatha, where the mind is completely organized, unified, and satisfied. Which means that the fulfillment of these Samadhi, Jhana, then is the knowledge and deliverance, which are the two kinds of enlightenment that we just talked about. So that's the whole Anapanasati in overview. There's a lot of details in there, and that the details that we can look at, especially we can go back and revisit the fourth tetrad, because the fourth tetrad has— it's actually a sequence of events. And the Buddha puts more emphasis upon the fading away, but the beginners don't see the fading away. They only see things as arising. In other words, if you— if someone— you're looking out into the darkness, way off in there, you see someone turn a flashlight on. You can see it. Then somebody else turns a flashlight on and you can see it. Then somebody else turns the flashlight on and you can see it. And after a while, people keep turning the flashlights off, and then someone turns the flashlight out, and you see that that flashlight went out.

**Speaker B:** I understand what you mean.

**Speaker A:** Okay, okay. Now that means that the fading away is a little bit more difficult to see, but we can if we're paying attention to it. So the first thing we do is with the Anicca is we pay attention to the arising, the arising, the arising, but then we begin both with logic and with direct seeing that anything that does arise has to pass away for the next thing to arise. And then that passes away for the third thing to arise, and that passes away for the next thing to arise. But instead of watching the arising, we begin to watch the passing away. That in fact, "I see you, Mara," is actually seeing the passing away of the Mara, because the new thought is, "I can see you, Mara." So it's got both the arising and the passing away, and in that passing away We also see the relinquishment of letting it go, that we no longer are clinging to anything that's happening momentarily because everything arises and passes away only to see something new. So when you're feeling a sense of loss, like somebody's cheated you or somebody said something about you and it's deflated the ego, and we have that sense of loss Recognizing that that sense of loss is actually that fading away process. Are we going to get stuck there, or are we going to go back into something new? Because everything keeps happening over and over again. Yeah, so something happened and we didn't like it, but it's because it faded away. Okay, well, something new is happening. And so that arising and passing away, arising and passing away, gives rise to that last point, step number 16. Anapanasati is the letting it go, the relinquishment. Actually, it has to do with throwing it back, that not only is it dying away, fading away, succeeding on itself, we're happily burying it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay. We're happily burying it. Go. No need to cling to it at all. This has actually in the beginning a kind of an effort to it, but as we progress, it becomes energetic, just like all of the other stuff. Okay, so anything that we're going to be clinging to, the beginning part of it, the letting go, is work. It's hard. It's kind of like flinging rather than just dropping or opening our hands. We actually have to cling it off. In fact, I had a monk friend long ago, his name was David, and he had the analogy: imagine that you picked a great big booger and it's there on your finger. You just don't let it go like that, it's not going to drop. You've got to flick that thing off, get rid of it, throw it out. Okay, that's the way that we think of the relinquishment, is to throw that thing out. It's dead anyway. Why am I clinging to the dead baby? That's actually the same story as Gotami had the baby that died. And so she carried it to one magician and a doctor after another, and nobody could bring that baby come back to life until she took it to the Buddha and asked him and says, okay, you go get one anise seed from 10 different households where no one in that house has never known death. It's got to be a magic Anicca, and it can only come from a household that has never known death. What— when she came back to the Buddha, she had already disposed of the body of the baby because every house she went to, and they were willing to give her an Anicca, but she couldn't take it if they had known death. And she asked, and everybody had known death. Okay, that was what allowed her— by knowing that death is— she could put— she could throw the baby out. She had to relinquish it. She could not just drop it, she had to throw it out. Just like our own trap, we could think of that also actually as the kitchen. You can't just recognize a bunch of garbage in there, you got to actually take it out to the road. You got to throw it out. Yeah, yeah. This is what the Anapanasati Sutra, the tail end of it, that highest point, is that effortless throwing things out because they're getting it beat. Don't cry over broken cups or spilt milk or bad laptops or anything because As they say on the bumper sticker, shit happens.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, definitely.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, shit happens. Okay, so you're going to lose stuff, but by noticing the arising and the passing away— everything falls away, everything dies— then this died too. Okay, fine, let's bury it. Just throw it out. Just get rid of it. You can walk into somebody's house and you can see whether that mentality is there or not. Is this house full of junk? Is that old tape recorder from 1966 still in the basement? Yeah. How about that stack of newspapers? How about those Playboys from the 1970s? Yes, we're not willing to let go of the past, cling to it. And the relinquishment is the full-on knowledge of, let's get rid of that stuff, let's get something new going. Yeah, let's let the past die, let it pass away. I think in fact that the deepest part of it has to do with fear of death. That if my laptop will die, that means that I'll die too, and we don't want laptops dying. When in fact, having a dead laptop is just a perfect opportunity to get a brand new laptop.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, sure.

**Speaker A:** But we have to let go of the bad feelings of the old one. This is the end in the detail about the way that the Anapanasati Sutta is set up the way that it is, is really making this distinction between what is wholesome and what is unwholesome. And the unwholesome things are to be let go of and released and everything dies. And when it's dead, it needs to be let go of and released.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, you're back.

**Speaker B:** Ah, you're back again. Well, yeah, thank you, Bhante, for answering my question.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, I think that you got something out of this, both on the practical and on the practice point. Yeah. So let's finish now.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And we'll let you go and relinquish. Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Thank you so much. Thank you so much.

**Speaker A:** The Pali word, by the way, one of the Pali words is Atamayata. I ain't gonna have nothing to do with Maya anymore. That's what it means. I mean, not do Maya, not going to do it. That's that relinquishment. It's like blow it out.

**Speaker B:** I'll keep that one in mind.

**Speaker A:** Okay, see you soon.

**Speaker B:** Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A), is a detailed exploration of how the core Buddhist practices of **Ānāpānasati** (mindfulness of breathing), **Satipaṭṭhāna** (the four foundations of mindfulness), and the **Seven Factors of Awakening** are interconnected, ultimately leading to liberation.

Here is a structured summary of the key points:

### **Core Framework: The Progressive Path**
The talk explains a sequential framework found in the Ānāpānasati Sutta:
1.  **Ānāpānasati** is practiced for the fulfillment of the **Four Foundations of Mindfulness**.
2.  The **Four Foundations of Mindfulness** are practiced for the fulfillment of the **Seven Factors of Awakening** (*Sambojjhaṅga*).
3.  The **Seven Factors of Awakening** are fulfilled for the attainment of **true knowledge and final deliverance** (*Vijjā-Vimutti*).

### **Key Insights and Explanations:**

**1. Ānāpānasati as the Primary Practice:**
*   Dhammarato emphasizes that Ānāpānasati is the Buddha's primary method for practicing the **Noble Eightfold Path**. It's not separate; it's the application of the path.
*   The 16 steps of Ānāpānasati are divided into four "tetrads," corresponding to the Four Foundations of Mindfulness (body, feelings, mind, and mental phenomena).
*   Beginners focus on the first three tetrads (calming the body, generating joy/pleasure, and observing the mind). As skill develops, practitioners spend more time on the **fourth tetrad**, which involves observing **impermanence (*anicca*), fading away, cessation, and relinquishment**.

**2. The Role of *Sati* (Mindfulness):**
*   *Sati* is fundamentally **"waking up"**—coming out of daydreams and concepts into present-moment sensory reality.
*   The first moment of waking in the morning is the perfect analogy: the simple knowing "I am awake."
*   This "waking up" allows us to see our mental processes clearly, shifting from being a victim of our thoughts to being the "boss" or "champion" of our mind.

**3. From Effort to Ease (The Seven Factors):**
*   The talk explains how factors from the Noble Eightfold Path mature into the effortless, "unremitting" qualities of the Seven Factors of Awakening.
    *   **Right Effort** becomes **Energy (*Viriya*)**—effortless and automatic, like a bent branch that no longer springs back.
    *   **Right Mindfulness** becomes unwavering **Mindfulness (*Sati*)**.
    *   The joy and happiness (*Pīti-Sukha*) cultivated in meditation become the default state.
    *   **Tranquility (*Passaddhi*)** and **Concentration (*Samādhi*)** become stable and unified.
    *   **Equanimity (*Upekkhā*)** is described as having "**sea legs**"—maintaining balance and coolness even when the external world (or internal turmoil) is chaotic.

**4. The Crucial Fourth Tetrad & Relinquishment:**
*   The heart of advanced practice is the fourth tetrad: observing **arising and passing away**.
*   Beginners see the "arising" of phenomena more easily. With skill, one learns to see the **"fading away"** more clearly. This leads to **relinquishment**.
*   Relinquishment (*Paṭinissagga*) is not passive dropping, but an active **"throwing out"** of unwholesome states, like flicking away a booger or taking out the garbage. It is happily letting go of what is dead and gone.
*   This applies to everything—lost possessions, hurtful words, or bad feelings. Clinging to them is like clinging to a dead child (referencing the story of Kisā Gotamī). True peace comes from burying the past and moving on.

**5. Integration of Teachings:**
*   The talk weaves together several suttas: **MN 118 (Ānāpānasati)**, **MN 10 (Satipaṭṭhāna)**, and **MN 117 (The Great Forty on the Eightfold Path)**. Studying them together provides a complete picture of the path.
*   The **hindrances** are removed via the Satipaṭṭhāna framework, while Ānāpānasati focuses on the positive method of **"gladdening the mind."**
*   The ultimate goal is a two-fold enlightenment: **knowledge** (seeing things as they are) and **deliverance** (releasing the burdens we've been clinging to).

### **Conclusion:**
The talk is a practical guide framing Ānāpānasati as the engine of the entire path. By diligently "waking up" to the breath and the present moment, one systematically develops all the factors needed to see impermanence clearly and actively relinquish suffering, culminating in a balanced, joyful, and liberated mind.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the talk, here are the key **metaphors and stories** used by Speaker A to explain complex Buddhist concepts:

### **Metaphors**

1.  **The Cat and the Mice / Daddy and the Kids:** Used to describe the function of mindfulness (*Sati*). When the "cat" (awareness) is away, the "mice" (unwholesome thoughts, hindrances) play and cause chaos. When the "cat" returns or "Daddy" wakes up, order is restored. This illustrates how waking up (mindfulness) shifts one from being a victim of mental chaos to being "the boss."

2.  **Bending a Limb (or Tree Branch):** Used to explain how repeated right effort changes mental habits. Initially, bending the limb (applying wholesome thought) requires effort, and it springs back (to old unwholesome patterns). With repeated bending, it holds the new shape more easily. This shows how effortful practice eventually becomes effortless and energetic.

3.  **Sea Legs:** Used to describe *Upekkha* (equanimity). A landlubber stumbles and falls on a storm-tossed ship, while the captain with "sea legs" maintains balance effortlessly. This symbolizes maintaining mental balance and coolness amid the constant turmoil (*Anicca*, impermanence) of life.

4.  **The Flashlight in the Darkness:** Used to illustrate the progression of insight in the fourth tetrad of *Anapanasati*. Beginners easily see flashlights turning on (the **arising** of phenomena). Advanced practitioners learn to also see them turning off (the **fading away**). This highlights the skill of observing cessation.

5.  **The Booger on the Finger:** A vivid, humorous metaphor for the active nature of relinquishment (*patinissagga*). You can't just passively "drop" it; you have to actively "flick it off." This emphasizes the deliberate effort needed to let go of mental clingings.

6.  **Taking Out the Garbage / The House Full of Junk:** Used to describe the mindset of non-clinging. You must not just notice garbage (old, useless mental formations), you must actively take it to the curb and throw it out. A house cluttered with old newspapers and relics symbolizes a mind clinging to the past.

7.  **Spinning Wheel of Sati:** Describes how mindfulness (*Sati*) is the central, connecting hub in multiple teachings (Anapanasati, Satipatthana, Seven Factors).

8.  **Chapter 1 and Chapter 31:** A book metaphor explaining the relationship between the **Eightfold Path** (the practice manual) and the **Seven Factors of Awakening** (the fruition or outcome).

9.  **Waking Up and Smelling the Coffee:** A common phrase repurposed. "Waking up" is *Sati* (mindfulness), and "smelling the coffee" is the subsequent sensory awareness and coming into the present moment, often initiated by a breath.

### **Stories**

1.  **The Story of Kisagotami and the Mustard Seed:** A famous Buddhist parable retold. The woman Kisagotami, grieving her dead child, is told by the Buddha to fetch a mustard seed from a home that has never known death. In seeking it, she universally discovers the truth of impermanence and death. This story is used to powerfully illustrate the necessity of **active relinquishment**—she couldn't just mourn; she had to "dispose of the body" and throw out her attachment, realizing death is a universal law.

2.  **The Prize Fighters in Their Dressing Rooms:** A short illustrative story to explain the difference between experiencing mind and mental formations (*sankhara*). Two fighters, one winner and one loser, will have entirely different thoughts and moods about the same event (e.g., their boss) afterward. This shows how underlying attitudes (mental formations/feelings) color our instantaneous thoughts.

3.  **The Dead Laptop:** A modern anecdote. The fear and sadness over a broken laptop is linked to a deeper fear of impermanence and death. The speaker reframes it as "a perfect opportunity to get a brand new laptop," but only if one can let go of the bad feelings about the old one. This ties the practice directly to everyday life.

### **Summary of Rhetorical Purpose:**
These metaphors and stories serve to **demystify and ground** abstract Buddhist doctrine (*Dhamma*) in tangible, everyday experiences. They make the path of practice (*Anapanasati* through to awakening) feel accessible, practical, and psychologically relatable. The speaker consistently moves from scriptural references to concrete, often humorous, imagery to aid understanding and application.
