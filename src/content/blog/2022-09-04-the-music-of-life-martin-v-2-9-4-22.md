### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Mara.

**Speaker B:** Basically.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. In fact, I have a lot of Martins.

**Speaker B:** You can say Martin Belgium or something.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. One of the guys named Martin, his name ended with a T. And another guy was in Germany. There's, I've had some Martins. So anyway, no problem with that. Yes. And I'm really glad that you did call. For one thing, you're in the position that many people are in, in the sense that you listen to videos on YouTube, these videos, and you probably listen to quite a few of them.

**Speaker B:** Every day, basically, yes.

**Speaker A:** And then you begin to put it into practice. You know, a lot of people watch a lot of movies, a lot of videos, and a lot of how-tos, this, that, and a lot of psychology, and then they never do anything about it. They just let the video play. And that it's good to point out that this is actually an active practice. Yes, it is something that we have to do, and we have to practice it in two ways. Um, in fact, it's— it has to be practiced in three ways, right? And it is very, very much like Music, that music has to be played in 3 ways. One is that when you don't know the music, you have to practice it. We have to practice, and we have to actually do that practice on our own. Say with the piano, it's between me and the piano, or the violinist is between he and the bow and the violin.

**Speaker B:** Right.

**Speaker A:** Practice over and over again, that I actually remember wanting my mom to get out of the room while I was practicing. This is something that you do in seclusion, which the Buddha talks about.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And then the second way of playing music is actually performance, where we share our music with others, but not with great skill, but rather in budding, producing, processing skill, that in fact, that we have to practice with other people and do it in order to gain that extra skill. And so this is what in music we would call a performance, that people would perform because they're in a group, they're now not on their own. And this then goes to the point point of, uh, a word called busking. You know what the word busking means?

**Speaker B:** No, I'm not sure.

**Speaker A:** The buskers are the street musicians, or in the, um, the malls or whatever. All right, so long as no one is around, they're either not playing at all or they're practicing. But if someone comes within earshot, they immediately start to perform to the audience. Guess what? That's a natural kind of thing. Even dogs do it, and humans do it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, the same with running. Like, if there's no one around, then you're just going at the right pace. And then if you see someone else, then almost automatically you start to pick up the pace a little bit. He puts on a show.

**Speaker A:** Yes, right, exactly, that we're in public. And so we all have a public and a private persona, and both of them are anatas that have to be changed and modified.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And that this— then I'll go ahead and talk, uh, just briefly about the third kind of way of playing music, and that is, is that when you are no longer practicing, you've got this piece so well. You see, even when a musician is performing a piece, he has to pay attention, he has to keep his mind in it. Yeah, he has not registered all the way to the very depth. And so he's got to watch what he's doing. That's especially true with very, very complex music like a sonata or a mazurka, or even a— what do they call it— a concerto? No, it's a solo performance.

**Speaker B:** All right, yeah, I don't know anything about music, so I can't help you there. I'm sorry.

**Speaker A:** But anyway, The third kind of music is when we actually do play with it, when we're unconcerned with the outcome, we're unconcerned with the audience. We know they're there, we're part of them, but we're no longer concerned with that. We're now concerned with just the music.

**Speaker B:** Yes, that's the mindset I've tried to develop with the meditation of being completely satisfied, not expecting anything. And then if I catch myself expecting something, I'm just like, I'm good, this is all I need. Like, I could sit like this for 3 days, I'm feeling that good. Like, it couldn't possibly feel any better. That's the mindset I've tried to actively develop in my meditation.

**Speaker A:** Martin, I really, really hope that many people will watch these videos— not now, not next year, but in the many, many years to come— so long as people support them and practice the way that you do, so that you can get that benefit out of it. Because so many will just listen to the video and not really pay attention to what they're doing. But this has to be practiced in the face of undaunting adversity, even when we're in private. The whole idea about getting in seclusion is to get away from the world. The real point, though, is that going into seclusion is to find out how much of the world you just drug in there with you, and now you have to become secluded from that. 2. Yeah, the real seclusion is the complete seclusion, and that's just the practice of being here now, being in the flow. So this middle section, this time of performance, is what you would now call putting the Dharma in your ordinary life. That you have to pay attention to what you're doing. And, um, you're going to actually have to work with two different kinds of people: those who are ordinary, don't know a thing about the Dharma, probably will become insulted if you try to give it to them, and they may call themselves Buddhist or even Western Buddhists. But they've got their ideas about how things are supposed to be, and that's how you find almost everyone. And then occasionally you'll run across those who are nobly minded in the moment, and these are the people that you want to associate with. Those who are nobly minded then will help you remain nobly minded for that time while you're in that middle section of the musical performance or being in public. Um, it's known in many ways. Uh, it's a very, very standard, easy thing to understand because it's so often, and that is, is that there's this quality of guilt by association, that if you hang around criminals, you'll probably become one. Yeah, that in fact, if you're hanging around criminals, you probably already are one.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think that's absolutely true, definitely.

**Speaker A:** And, and those who go to the same evangelical church have the same views about all kinds of things. Okay, so in that case, we're talking about a community spirit or a community attitude, a social attitude. And that happens in all of the interactions that we have. In other words, if you have one of the world's best concert pianists— and that's the word that I was looking for, concerto— the concert pianist can walk out with the fanciest piano, a Steinway or something like that, in front of a bunch of tribal drummers, and they're not going to appreciate his music.

**Speaker B:** Probably not, no.

**Speaker A:** Right, okay. So that's the whole issue about the society within which we live. We have to deal with that society at that level of where the society is in order to gain the skills of learning how to deal with things. This is the performance. That you got to be able to continue that performance even when cabbages are being thrown.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And this we don't get when we're off in seclusion, except that almost always we start throwing cabbages at ourselves about our practice.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I've tried to avoid that as well, criticizing my lack of practice. Instead of just practicing right then and there.

**Speaker A:** Oh, right now I can do it. Never mind how long I didn't remember to do it. I can at least do it now.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it's very useful because no matter what happens, you can always just practice right now. It's as simple as like snapping your fingers. But sometimes it's just hard to remember.

**Speaker A:** It's as simple as remembering to snap the fingers. It's even easier than snapping the fingers. Snapping the fingers is a whole lot of work.

**Speaker B:** Yes, exactly. It's as easy as in one of your videos I watched recently, you talked about how you can go from thinking about green to thinking about red. It's almost as simple as that. Of course, you may think about red for like half a second, and then you're back to green. But then when you're back to green, you can just remember to think again about red. And just like that, you just need to put like the small effort of remembering and doing it right then and there. And but I mean, still, of course, it happens to me all the time that I'm like criticizing myself, criticizing, but as I notice it, then I stop. And it's like relief. You're like, oh yeah, I don't need to do that. Why? Why was I doing that? This is not happening.

**Speaker A:** Well, now we can go a little bit deeper into the Dhamma in that regard. Okay, and we'll talk about that middle section later, which I'm now going to label for you as Sangha. Yes, the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha. The Dhamma is, let us say, the knowledge or the teaching itself. And then the Buddha is starting to associate the mind with the nope. And that's the Buddha, by the way, is in your own mind.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** All right. And so with that, uh, getting that noble mind from the Dhamma, now the big job is to take it and become part of the Sangha. You become the noble in the crowd until, uh, you can get to a place where you can really get the benefit, and that is where everybody around you is noble. And yes, yeah, that's what I'm trying to get going and instilled in the minds of all of the students and those who come to listen to the videos, is to begin to think about where are the nobles, how can I contact the nobles. Yes, what do I go looking for in the nobility of others, what is in fact an honorable person. You know, they talk about politicians and judges, court judges, you call them Your Honor, stuff like that. I have never met an Anagami, a person of honor, who would be also a politician, or who would also be a judge judging others, dispensing Dukkha left, right, and center. Okay, yeah, left, right, and center. The center part is when you break both halves and you cut the baby in half and give each mom have a baby, right? Everybody's got— no one's happy, and no one is happy with that. So, uh, the real honorable person is in fact only honorable from time to time, and his job is to pay attention to keep his mind noble even though he's out in the world. But he would have good friends who are also high quality, noble. That in fact, um, there's two ways of talking about it. Uh, like attracts like, or another way of saying it is cream rises to the top.

**Speaker B:** True.

**Speaker A:** Okay, now it actually depends upon what you've got there, because so does shit. Yeah, okay. So, uh, knowing that, we have to float to the top. And number 2, figure out which kind of water we should be living in and floating on the top of. And so getting in touch with the nobles and becoming— now, by the way, where do you live?

**Speaker B:** So I live in Belgium, in the south of Belgium, so where people speak French. Right next to Germany and France, in between France and Germany, and the south of the country.

**Speaker A:** The only place that I know that would be any place near you, and it's not near, is Plum Village, which is in the south of France.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I've never been there, but I'm very much aware of it.

**Speaker A:** With Thich Nhat Hanh. Well, Thich Nhat Hanh is deceased.

**Speaker B:** Yes, unfortunately, I discovered that recently.

**Speaker A:** There's something that's even more unfortunate, and that is the number of monks and nuns there are primarily Western, not Asian. If he had been an Asian Tathagata and left behind him a community of Asians who had been grown up in Buddhism and really understood it that way, you would be even better off. But I'm really suspicious about Westerners because we've got our really weird ideas.

**Speaker B:** Yes, about the Dhamma, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Uh-huh. So, what I actually think is good is to go into places where we will find the possibility of associating with nobles. And that that's also if we get in, free room and board. So you might as well move right in. And then those who get advanced and brought far enough along in the Dharma to where they become really, really into it, really devoted— there is something different between the high school student who plays the clarinet in the band and the university professor who teaches clarinet at the state university.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, of course.

**Speaker A:** What is it though?

**Speaker B:** I guess.

**Speaker A:** Much more practice. Is it skill or is it attitude?

**Speaker B:** I mean, yes, the attitude, but a lot of skill as well.

**Speaker A:** The attitude and the dedication to practice. Confidence. 'Now we're going there.' That's in fact it: the confidence and the security of knowing that you can do it, and therefore practicing well enough to actually do it. This is the quality that we need to look for. And so in that regard, that high school student clarinet player needs encouragement.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And if she gets enough encouragement, she'll continue to practice and start to enjoy it, and then her dedication to it will grow. The same thing happens in the Dharma, that we become dedicated to the Dharma. Well, if you're actually dedicated to the clarinet, you can go become a professor at any university. You can go join the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra. There's hundreds of them around. They all have several clarinet players. Not too many Thupas, I know, but at least they've got a lot of clarinets, and so there's a lot of jobs. What does someone who becomes completely devoted to the Dharma do?

**Speaker B:** Well, for a job, I'm not sure.

**Speaker A:** That was the reason the Buddha started the Sangha. Yeah, his Buddha Sangha was to give people the system whereby they could have the room and board that they needed, adequate clothing, adequate housing, adequate food, adequate medical attention is all we need. And that's what the basis of Buddhism is is about. You find it from Village, or actually any of many of the— actually any of the hundreds of Watts that have come from Asia, mostly because it's actually in the United States more than Europe, because of the Vietnamese War and the fact that the UN and the World Health Organization and many other NCOs really, really worked on them to get all of those refugees that they had created a home. So they brought them to the West by the millions. Yeah, by the millions, millions of Vietnamese, millions of, uh, Laotian and, um, uh, Cambodians. And, uh, where all of the Thais came from was because Thailand was the Rest and Recreation, the R&R centers. And many of the Flyboys and all of the troops who came to Thailand picked up a wife and carried her back. And so, there's a bunch of them. And so, this is the basis of Buddhism in the West, real Buddhism. And so, those Asian communities came together after they got deported, transported, relocated, whatever is the right word for it, into the US. Then they went back to Thailand to get the monks to build up the temples, and they knew what they were looking for. So there's a lot of really good, high-quality Buddhist Asian monks in the West.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, not in my country though, I don't think so.

**Speaker A:** Not in Belgium that I know of. I know there's things in Germany and whatnot. But there's also what we're forming is the online Sangha.

**Speaker B:** The what, excuse me?

**Speaker A:** The online Sangha.

**Speaker B:** Online, right, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Right, we have an online Sangha that is basically Skype-based right now and will remain so until somebody has a better plan. But right now that seems to work.

**Speaker B:** Right now is good enough.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, I gave, when I sent you the first email, I mentioned the URLs that you needed to punch on, to get into the US and UK Sangha. You probably fit into the UK Sangha right well.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I've seen the links, I've listened to the calls as well. My difficulty is the, the time difference, because I have young children, and so in the morning they need a lot of attention, and by the time everything is settled, then it's like past 4 PM for you, basically, because there's a— I'm not sure what time it is for you. For me, it is 7:40 in the morning.

**Speaker A:** The UK Sangha is 4 o'clock Thailand, 4 PM, which at UK time is 10, so that would be 11 to 12 for you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that one might work.

**Speaker A:** What time is it right now for you?

**Speaker B:** So for me it's 7:40 AM right now.

**Speaker A:** Okay, see, so that's 4, 3, only about 3 hours from now is when that call will start.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so just letting you know.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I try, I try.

**Speaker A:** That's one of the— Okay, so that's the whole quality though, is learning to be around nobles, because you won't find nobles on Reddit. In fact, the nobles will never receive Reddit.

**Speaker B:** On Reddit you just find people arguing about terminology and the meaning of this or that word, and it's endless arguments. Reddit or Buddhist forums.

**Speaker A:** Well, that's because they're not set up and organized around the noble mind.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, no.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so coming back to the whole point though is that, um, as you're practicing on your own now, you begin to say, well, why did I do that? Remember that, that question? The answer to that is Okay, let's look into that. Why did you do that? Let's go right down into there. That's what, uh, the, the actual investigation is all about. This is what Paticcasamuppada is all about. Okay, and in the beginning, the easy part is to ask the question and disregard the answer because we're too busy having fun. Okay, right. There will come some time when we actually do want to understand how the mind works, because then we can really begin to control it.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** So we do then begin to ask those kinds of why questions, but not in the Western kind of way, that in fact we do it in the sense of the Four Noble Truths. This is Dukkha. The 'why' then would be, 'Where does it come from?' And that leaves us then with the opening of Pandora's box, the inspection of the Second Noble Truth. We've got to go really into the mind to find out what's there. But before we do so much of that, we need to, number one, just recognize what Dukkha is. And then number 3, the Third Noble Truth, is to come out of it and get right into the third position, the Third Noble Truth. And in fact, it's a whole lot easier to do the investigation of the Second Noble Truth from the position of the Third Noble Truth rather than from the position of the Dukkha, which would be, oh, poor me, why does this keep happening? Well, that's not the right time.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, exactly. But to me, basically, it's always you wanting something else than what you have right now. It took me literally 17 years, because I'm now 34, I started Buddhism when I was 17, and it's only when I came across Buddhadasa and your videos that I finally understood the Second Noble Truth. Before that, it was just massive confusion to me, I was like, "How can I be free of desire?" questions, questions, instead of just like recognizing right now that I'm feeling dissatisfied because I want something else, and I can just let go of that desire right now, not thinking about the future or anything, just right now letting go and being just like, right now is good enough. And then in that realization, I mean, to me at least, this is the second noble truth, recognizing the origin of this dissatisfaction. Then the third one, letting go. And the fourth one is It's just this process of just letting go. And if I investigate, then it's usually something like that. I might be thinking about the future and what am I going to say to this or that person. And then usually if I stop and think about it, I realize that it's because I'm not happy with what I'm doing just right now, and I'm projecting to the future. Worrying about the past, and if I can just let go basically of this dissatisfaction of not being happy with what is right in front of me right now. I mean, that's what I've understood.

**Speaker A:** I want to make sure that you hear me when I say I congratulate you for your progress.

**Speaker B:** Thank you.

**Speaker A:** Excellent. Okay, and that that's something that is built into the package also, that in the Eightfold Noble Path we start with Sati, to remember, to look at what we're doing and then make the change. Okay, and that looking at what we're doing can go really, really deep, and that's part of the deep investigation. So, the main thing though, is to make that change, to come out of that. That Samma Sanghappa though, is the thing that comes afterwards. And with an understanding of first Anapanasati, and the process that we go through, we can see then, that the actually developing of the skills of the feeling of being on top of the world is actually just an attitude that we have to do. We have to learn to congratulate ourselves. Yeah, to stop being the victim. Just stop it. And if you stop being a victim, there's only one possibility left, and that is I'm not a victim. Isn't that marvelous?

**Speaker B:** Yes, on top of my own pile of dirt. I like that image.

**Speaker A:** Right. And so you can in fact get on top of your own pile of dirt, just with the change of an attitude. The attitude is, you said, I can do this, I can handle this, I've got this wire. And in fact, that's the kind of attitude then that we develop when we're in, uh, the woods on our own in private. And that's the attitude then that we can get up and go out into the world with that attitude of, hey, I can handle whatever the world's going to throw at me today. Yeah, I can do it. Okay. And most of us, we go out with, uh, intimidation, with halting, with, "I don't really want to go and I don't quite know why." And that has to do with, because it's not good enough, rather than that attitude, "Oh, I don't care what it is, I can do it, I can handle it." And so that Samma Sanghappa that gets started when we're in seclusion, then kind of gets polished as we deal with other people. It and keep coming out of it in a win-win situation over and over and over again. You have to polish that stone, polish that axe or whatever, and get it.

**Speaker B:** Sharp.

**Speaker A:** Okay, that's the whole idea, is that we have to hone these skills. And the way that we hone these skills is with other nobles. That's how these skills get honed. And the skills themselves almost always come in getting the correct solution to that question of "Why?" Why did I do that? Why did I start to do that? And that's when we begin to look at the feelings of confusion, the feelings of not liking, the feelings of fear, the feelings of longing, all of those kinds of feelings that we need to deal with, we only can deal with them after we learn to control our feelings in general. Okay, in other words, we're going to look at this crap from the bright side of life.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, I think that is important. Otherwise you don't even recognize that you are lost in these negative mind states. You have to recognize them and then know how to leave them, and then you can realize, oh my God, I'm.

**Speaker A:** Back over on my shoulder and say, oh yeah, I know him. Hello darkness, my old friend, I know what you're about. Okay, so this is, this is the whole teaching then of why we make that effort, that change, to throw the unwholesome thoughts out and substitute them with good wholesome thoughts, which will also be the gladdening of the mind. And so what we're going to do to gladden the mind is to gladden the mind by giving ourselves injunctions, instructions, and thoughts about how you want to feel, rather than how you're inclined to feel, or how you've been in the past feeling. That in fact, we didn't know it at the time, but all of those years we were merely talking ourselves into feeling bad. Now we're actually going to take the time and effort, real effort, to talk ourselves into feeling good. And we will not be talking ourselves into feeling good if we're criticizing ourselves. That.

**Speaker B:** It's very important to recognize that because you might be lost in your thoughts and negative thoughts, and then you notice it, and then right away you start criticizing yourself about it. And you have to like notice the criticism and then just let go of that as well, and then you can feel good. And I've tried to really develop like really wholesome mind states, thinking like, I cannot possibly feel any better than right now. I'm like, this is like perfect. I could stay like this the whole day. I'm like, as I'm sitting right now, like, this is— yeah, this is heaven. Like, why would I need anything else? I'm like feeling like amazing. And then as soon as, like, I'm like, yeah, but I mean, I could move. Like, I saw you. No, I'm just good. I'm feeling amazing. And like, it's like going on and on like that. And then the more I do it, then the longer it lasts. But then eventually I snap out of it, I'm like criticizing again or whatever, and then I saw that.

**Speaker A:** Or something from the outside happened.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, also. Then you have to react.

**Speaker A:** There is a scene in a movie that's quite remarkable enough that it's, I mean, this is real Dhamma. And it's coming from this, uh, the movie, um, The Life of Brian, which is the Monty Python movie. They do a lot of really interesting funny Dharma.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so, uh, Brian— this whole crowd of people are chasing him because they're, you know, he lost his shoe and that— but then he became the symbol of the shoe or whatever. And while he was running away from them and not where watch where he was going, he stumbled into a pit. And inside of this pit out in the desert, there was a, uh, a Rishi, or a holy man, or someone who had taken about a silence. And when Brian fell on him, the guy says, oh. And Brian picks himself up and says, I'm extremely sorry, sir. And then the guy says, I said, oh, I have been silent for 20 years and you made me say oh. And then he starts jumping up and down in anger. Okay, right. So this, this is something that happens to us often. Here we are sitting in bliss and all of a sudden Brian falls on us.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And we say ouch. Or we say, "Oh!" Right? And there is when it all gets started up again.

**Speaker B:** Yes, and we forget that we can just go back to the Noble Silence. Just then.

**Speaker A:** That's right, we can just shut up and never mind, start again.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** That's the point that we don't recognize, that we keep falling into that pit. Or getting, uh, let us say, impressed upon. Someone falls in on us, the whole world caves in, or whatever like that. And so now we think we have to dig our way out of something rather than just enjoying the show.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so this is, this is part of the training. This is how— this is why we have to do this step-by-step, the three stages of on the way to— we have to actually practice this in seclusion and then practice being out in the world while things are falling on us left, right, and center, so that we can then learn to sit there the way that you're talking about at the end and says, never mind, I'm just enjoying the show. Yeah, the whole world's just hating me, and I can like that too. Okay, that's a training, that's a skill that has to be developed.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, but it's so easy to fall back. Like, you know, I might be developing these positive thoughts and I'm like, oh, I'm feeling so good. And then like it pops up in my mind, yeah, but what if something happened to your children? Would you still be able? And I'm like, wait a second, my children are just fine. I like, I don't have to have these thoughts. I mean, they're like, they're downstairs eating breakfast and chilling out, and there's no, there's no need for me to worry. And like, but if you don't recognize it, then you start doubting, like, yeah, my God, could I practice? But like, whoa, there's nothing wrong with them, they are just fine. Like, take a deep breath, forget about that thought. Like, this, this is like Dukkha right there, just like popped in your mind, and you can recognize it, let it go. But then it's also easy to forget. But then as soon as you remember, you just do it. Never mind.

**Speaker A:** But the remembering is a skill to be developed. That really an important part of that has to do with that if we remember and remember and practice remembering, we will remember more often, just like if you practice music. The way that we can actually practice that is by practicing with our breathing, to control the breathing and mindfully make sure that this is a long, easy breath, and mindfully breathe a long, easy out-breath. That's the training of Sati. It's right there in the sutras, that we train the Sati with the long and the short breathing. We have to be mindful with each. And on a breath cycle, on an in and an out, that's two points of time for Sati. Remember to breathe in long, then we got a long time to think about all the troubles in the world, or not. And then we have to remember to breathe out long and let go of all of those troubles that we just got Anicca.

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** And the breath. Okay, so, uh, this is the practice that helps develop the Sati so that it will be there for us when the world caves in on us, or we'll have a great big thought about, well, if I'm happy, my children will have a terrible life, or something ridiculous like that, you know. More than likely, if you're happy, if they have a really happy dad, they're going to have a But you like to have a happy life.

**Speaker B:** Oh yeah, I mean, they're much better off ever since I came across the good Dhamma, because I don't get angry anymore. I catch it, and I'm like just laughing at myself for getting angry for nothing, and just like smiling, and then being like, okay, chill out, I can deal with this situation, I don't need to get upset over this. Whereas in the past, not very often, but I would snap. Start shouting for like nothing.

**Speaker A:** Precisely so. So there is the life of Brian skit right played out. Okay, your children fall right on you and you get grumpy.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and then I recognize it.

**Speaker A:** Excellent, excellent. That's really great. I'm glad to hear you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and just like especially laughing at myself. That's also the skill I've tried to develop is like catching myself being ridiculous and getting angry over nothing, and then just laughing like, yeah, I saw you, I don't need that. I'm like, I'm happy right now, I don't need to get angry. My children don't need me to get angry. I'll deal with this like wise mind. It's good. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, well, uh, this has been a really, really good little conversation that we've had. Yes, thank you. We should go from here is that you should watch videos that you can actually find that have the word PS or Paticcasamuppada or something like that and review some of those. Others that are like on the five aggregates, that this is an important quality that once we get the mind fit to work This is the work to do, is to figure out how the mind works. And so I would then, for us, you can call every week if you want to, once a week, twice a week, that's okay. And we can deal with it on a one-by-one.

**Speaker B:** Okay, all right, I'll try that. Like on a Sunday morning is probably the best time for me. The rest of the week I start work quite early in the morning, and then by the time I'm back home it's like nighttime for you. So yes, but on a Sunday morning I should be able to. Yes, thank you very much.

**Speaker A:** That's good. Yes, I will see you soon.

**Speaker B:** Yes, thank you, Dhammarato. Have a good day or afternoon. Yes, bye-bye.

**Speaker A:** Everything is fine.

**Speaker B:** Yes, it is.

**Speaker A:** I wish you a very happy moment right now.

**Speaker B:** Yes, count on me. All right, goodbye. Cheers.

**Speaker A:** Okay.


### Summary

Based on the provided transcript, here is a summary of the Dhamma talk between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and Martin (Speaker B):

### **Core Teaching: The Three Stages of Practice (The "Musical" Analogy)**
Dhammarato structures the entire talk around a central analogy comparing Dhamma practice to learning music, which unfolds in three essential stages:

1.  **Practice in Seclusion (The Buddha):** This is the foundational, private work—like a musician practicing alone. It's where you develop the basic skills of meditation, learn to recognize and let go of dissatisfaction (*dukkha*), and cultivate a joyful, satisfied mind "on top of your own pile of dirt." The key here is self-encouragement and overcoming self-criticism.

2.  **Performance in the World (The Sangha):** This is applying the Dhamma in daily life and social interaction—like a musician performing with others. It's where you "polish" your skills by maintaining a noble mind amidst adversity, difficult people, and unexpected events ("when cabbages are being thrown"). The goal is to learn to handle whatever arises without losing your inner balance.

3.  **Mastery/Flow (The Dhamma):** This is the integrated state where practice becomes effortless and joyful in itself—like a master musician completely absorbed in the music, unconcerned with the audience or outcome. It's the mindset of being "completely satisfied" and "just enjoying the show."

### **Key Practical Points Discussed:**

*   **From Theory to Action:** Dhammarato praises Martin for actively practicing rather than just passively consuming Dhamma talks. The emphasis is on **doing it now**, making the simple effort to remember and change your mental state in the present moment.
*   **The Role of the Sangha:** Associating with "noble-minded" friends (the *Sangha*) is crucial for honing your practice in stage two. They provide support, encouragement, and a conducive environment for growth. Dhammarato suggests seeking out serious Buddhist communities (noting skepticism about some Western interpretations) and mentions the online Sangha he facilitates.
*   **Investigation with Joy:** The deep investigation of the mind (the Second Noble Truth) is best done from a position of established well-being (the Third Noble Truth), not from a state of suffering. This means first gladdening the mind, then looking at its workings.
*   **The Central Skill of *Sati* (Mindfulness):** The fundamental skill is **remembering**—to catch negative patterns, self-criticism, or worry, and to consciously choose a wholesome, joyful state instead. This is practiced formally through mindful breathing (noting long/short breaths) and informally throughout the day.
*   **Dealing with Setbacks:** Life will inevitably disrupt your peace ("Brian falls in the pit"). The skill is in recognizing the disruption and **immediately returning** to the practice without self-recrimination—"never mind, start again."

### **Martin's Experience:**
Martin shares his journey, highlighting a breakthrough in understanding the Second Noble Truth (the origin of suffering) as the **desire for something other than the present moment**. His practice focuses on:
*   Actively developing a mindset of complete satisfaction.
*   Letting go of desires and worries about past/future as they arise.
*   Catching and laughing at his own anger or negativity.
*   Recognizing that peace is always available by "snapping the fingers" of attention back to the present.

### **Conclusion & Encouragement:**
Dhammarato congratulates Martin on his clear understanding and progress. The talk ends with an invitation to continue one-on-one discussions and to study specific deeper teachings (like *Paticcasamuppada* - Dependent Origination) to understand the mechanics of the mind. The ultimate encouragement is to develop the unshakable attitude: **"I can handle whatever the world's going to throw at me today."**

**In essence, the talk is a roadmap for moving Dhamma from private meditation into a resilient, joyful, and socially engaged way of being in the world.**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary metaphor used throughout the talk is **music practice and performance**, which structures the entire discussion of spiritual practice. Here’s a breakdown of the metaphors and stories:

### **Core Metaphor: The Three Ways of Playing Music**
This metaphor is used to describe the three essential modes of Dhamma (Dharma) practice:

1.  **Practice in Seclusion (Private Practice):**
    *   Likened to a musician practicing alone (e.g., a pianist alone with the piano).
    *   Represents the foundational, private work of meditation and self-observation, away from the world's distractions. The Buddha's emphasis on seclusion is referenced here.

2.  **Performance (Practice in the World/Sangha):**
    *   Likened to playing music with or for others, like in a group or a "busking" (street performance) situation.
    *   Represents integrating the practice into daily life and social interactions. It's where skills are tested and polished "in public," dealing with adversity ("even when cabbages are being thrown").
    *   The speaker explicitly labels this stage as **Sangha** (the spiritual community).

3.  **Masterful Play (Embodied Realization):**
    *   Likened to a musician so skilled they are unconcerned with the audience or outcome and are completely one with the music.
    *   Represents a state of deep flow and satisfaction in the practice itself, free from craving or expectation. Speaker B relates this to a meditation mindset of complete contentment.

### **Supporting Metaphors & Analogies**
*   **Running:** Speaker B adds that running alone vs. with others is similar—you naturally "pick up the pace" and "put on a show" when observed.
*   **Cream and Scum Rising to the Top:** Used to discuss spiritual community. "Cream rises to the top" symbolizes noble friends, but the speaker adds, "so does shit," emphasizing the need to discern which "water" (community) you're in.
*   **Pandora's Box:** Used to describe the deep, sometimes challenging investigation into the causes of suffering (the Second Noble Truth).
*   **Polishing a Stone or Honing an Axe:** Describes how skills are sharpened and refined through repeated practice, especially with "noble" companions.
*   **On Top of Your Own Pile of Dirt:** Represents the shift in attitude from victimhood to self-mastery and contentment with one's present circumstances.
*   **Guilt by Association / Community Attitude:** Discusses how the people you surround yourself with shape your mindset, comparing it to church communities or criminals.
*   **Concert Pianist for Tribal Drummers:** Illustrates that your understanding (Dhamma) must be communicated in a way appropriate to your audience/society.

### **Stories & References**
*   **The Life of Brian (Monty Python):** The speaker recounts the scene where Brian falls into a pit on top of a hermit who had been silent for 20 years. The hermit yells "Oh!" and then becomes furious. This story is used to illustrate how easily one can be knocked out of a peaceful state ("Noble Silence") by an external event and then compound the problem with a reactive, angry narrative instead of simply returning to peace.
*   **The Judgment of Solomon:** Referenced indirectly with the phrase "cut the baby in half" to describe a misguided, "middle-way" compromise that leaves everyone unhappy, contrasting it with true wisdom.

### **Overall Narrative**
The talk weaves these elements into a larger story of **spiritual progression**: starting with solitary practice (**Dhamma**), learning to apply it skillfully in the world with noble friends (**Sangha**), which ultimately refines the mind's innate noble quality (**Buddha**). The central musical metaphor provides a clear, relatable framework for this entire journey.
