### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Okay, so yeah, well, tomorrow I'll be going to Amaravati Monastery. Oh, Amaravati. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** Okay, in Himmelhamstad. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, and yeah, I just wanted to talk to you about that because It's a bit like, it's difficult, like I really want to go and really get really immersed in the whole thing, you know, in an environment, because I'm just by myself and it kind of sucks to do this kind of thing, you know.

**Speaker B:** All right, that will work. Yeah, that's a good place to go.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Um, I've got several pieces of advice about paying care, and one of the pieces of advice is that, uh, Anagarhati at Hemel Hempstead was founded by, uh, Thai people. Thai money went into it. Ajahn Chah was there, and he had several in his lifetime very good students. And he brought students to Wat Suwan Mokkh. And so Wat Suwan Mokkh and Bhikkhu Buddhadasa is very close to Ajahn Chah and Wat Phra Bong and Wat Anicca and Wat Amaravati. And even so much is kind of a Anagami too. But after that, you get a whole lot of Western people in robes who have not lived for years in Thailand. Many of them, in fact, when they ordained, the monks that you will meet, have been probably at Amaravati all along. Basically what I'm saying is, just because you meet somebody in a robe, doesn't mean— well, let us put it this way, it still means that you need to do an investigation. Because you're going to have a wide variety, but one of the things to make sure that you do is to go talk to the abbot. Because the abbot will be a senior monk, and the more senior he is, the longer he's been in it, which means that the more likely it is that he is part of the original lineage. That kind of, um, it would be to be expected for it to start to rot away because the lineage wasn't large enough. To begin with in Ajahn Chah's lifetime. If he had had 100 really, really well-established Western monks, then they may have been able, 100 of them, to handle the traffic that's coming or has come. But because he only had 4 or 5, that meant that they were kind of overwhelmed, and there was not a lot of discussion with teaching, that in fact, that what happened at Anagarhant is very similar to what happened in the time of Ashoka, which was because Buddhism became popular because it was, let us.

**Speaker A:** Say, supported by— In the time of the what?

**Speaker B:** Sorry, Ashoka, King Ashoka. Ashoka was the great great-grandson of King Bimbisara, who was a supporter of the Buddha. All right, and he made— after he conquered most of India, he finally then spread Buddhism throughout India. And in a way of spreading it out, he also spread it very thin. And so a lot of new people came all of a sudden, and they didn't get good Dharma. There were only about 500 or so noble monks at the time, and they were literally overwhelmed and inundated with new students, which is also happening in the West today. And so, knowing that, the best place to find refuge then is to go to the abbot, because he's most likely going to be supportive of the things that you need to do. And be very skeptical of everybody else. So, that's one thing to look for, because I'm pretty sure that the abbot is still, even in these days, even It was 35 years ago when I was there with Ajahn Samatha, and I think that much of the structure that he set up is still there, but some of the functionality has fallen through the cracks.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, one of my big kind of, I guess, intentions, or what's on my mind, is to find someone or find people people or monks or someone who can— I can maybe kind of befriend a lot and just kind of get to know them and see how they live and how they practice and stuff like that, you know?

**Speaker B:** Like, well, guess what? If you go to the abbot and talk to him and tell him that you've been, you know, interested in Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and the noble teachings, etc., like that, then he will probably put you with someone who will be very good for you when you're there. In other words, by using the word Bhikkhu Buddhadasa, you're almost announcing that you would rather speak on the supramundane noble level than the ordinary level of Buddhism where most people are. They start out at the ordinary level, and they don't meet enough nobles.— to actually become.

**Speaker A:** Noble One, Sha.

**Speaker B:** So— Go to the Abbot and tell him that you're already familiar with the Noble Dharma. He'll know what to do, if he's.

**Speaker A:** Noble. So just mention Bhikkhu Bhikkhuni, or Bhikkhu Bodhisattva?

**Speaker B:** Actually, because he's most likely a long, an Englishman. In fact, I'm not sure who the abbot is. I know that after Samatha, that was Anagami, Anapanasati, and Vipassana has been. But these are, like I said, it's been 35 years, so times have changed, and I have not been keeping up. The older the monk, the better. And the abbot will have to be at least 20 years, more than likely 30, or in that case, maybe even 40. So you might get right with the old guard. I don't know who's the abbot there, but since that's the number one Western temple, Western Thai temple is the number one, more than likely they're going to have a number one first-class Western Thai tradition monk. It's just logical. After that, it's going to be a crapshoot. That there will be monks there that are there to follow the rules and expect you to do the same thing, and they might get grouchy about it. So you can put them over on that side of, well, these are people who are still ordinary, and I'm looking for happy, noble, everything-is-okay kind of practice.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, I, uh, I'll be there for about a month. That's what I said in the, uh That's what I said, I'll commit at least for a month, I'll stay there for a month. So I'm hoping to meet some of these noble people.

**Speaker B:** Well, through these eyes that I've given you to know how to look, keep a list. I would really like to be updated with who's there and who's where and what kind of mind state that they have, etc., like that. Because like I said, it'll be a a crapshoot. There'll be all varieties of people. Just because they're in the robes doesn't necessarily mean anything, that they can be there for other reasons. However, there's a point that needs to be made here, and that is that one of the hallmarks that the Buddha talks about, that you might have heard words like Srotapanna, Srotapanna. One of the really characteristics of a Srotapanna, in fact there's several obvious characteristics of a Srotapanna, and one is that he's generally interested in the Dhamma, that's all he really cares about. And because that's all he cares about, that's probably why he's become a monk. Just because that's all he cares about. So the question of when you talk to people, what do they care about? If they talked about computers, if they talk about teaching, if they talk about this, that, and the other thing, that's different than if they want to talk to you about Dharma. Okay, that's in the stream, in the flow. Number 2, that not only do they want to spend time and talk about the Dhamma and talk about the Suttas, etc. They will also be enthusiastic about it, that they're joyful and cheerful also, enthusiastic and delighted in the Dharma. So these are three characteristics of a Srotapanna in an informal sense. In the formal sense, the Srotapanna is one who takes refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha, And if he's taking refuge in the Sangha, that means he's in the Sangha. So he ordains. So even in that regard, even in a more formal context, that's becoming, taking, or let us say, taking refuge in the Sangha, as well as taking refuge in the Dhamma. Okay. And so the next point is that the Srotapanna is one whose mind is straightened out enough that his behavior is not an issue or a problem for him, in the sense that if you don't want anything, when the mind is noble, then you're unlikely to go harm someone to get it. You're unlikely to steal something. You're unlikely to also lie to someone about it, or boss them around. And that will be a key. Find out who the monks are that are bossy, because they're still in the power game. They're still thinking that being a monk is an important thing to do, rather than the— being the monk means that I'm just really super interested in the Dharma. That's all I care about, is the Dharma.

**Speaker A:** Can I ask, what is the— what's the main difference between someone like a layperson who takes refuge in the Three Jewels and and an Anagami, someone who's ordained? Like, what's— is there a difference? You know what I mean? Somebody takes refuge in Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, and a monk who takes refuge.

**Speaker B:** Okay, if the, if the mind— the layman takes refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, the Sangha, that means that he probably will spend a lot of time at the wat, and he may even live there. And in fact, you will find lay people who may in fact be more dedicated to the Dhamma than some of the monks. And how do you know? Well, number one, they're at the wat, so they've got a couple of things in their favor already. Okay, so that dedication— dedicated enough to go and stay someplace, like you're dedicated enough to go stay a month already. Right? That's when you really care about the Dharma and you want to be around other people who are in the Dharma. That's the Sangha. The question is, can you be Buddha while you're doing that? The answer to that one is, watch your facial expressions to see if you can find a smile. Do you actually enjoy the Dharma? That's the thing. Being dedicated to the Dharma and even enthusiastic about the Dharma is not quite enough. You've also got to be completely joyful, completely delighted is the Pali word. In fact, the actual Pali word here is Mandala. Nandi, which is Ananda. Okay, you got Ananda, the guy who was with the Buddha, his number one student and his cousin, and the one who stayed with him for 25 years. Ananda, right? That's the name, which is Nandi, the one who is full of bliss. Full of joy, happy. So these are the things to look for, and these are the things also for you to.

**Speaker A:** Exude. For me to exude? For me to— you to exude my enthusiasm to learn the Dharma. I want to understand it, and I.

**Speaker B:** Want to— right, you really are interested in Anagami, you even came to be with the Dharma and the Dharma people, the Sangha, and you're going to exude that Nandi. You're going to express yourself joyfully and happily, even when you're being criticized, knowing that nobles are probably not going to be criticized. So do you have any specific questions to ask about going there? Take your shoes off and put them where everybody else is putting their shoes when they take them off. That's the easy.

**Speaker A:** One. Yeah, I saw— I started to like kind of contemplate a little bit about staying there for a while because I started to look at how things work around there and how the schedule is and how everything works. And I saw how there's like a part of me, a very large roaring child that is like, wow, we really don't want to do this kind of thing. But I'm like, no, I'm kind of.

**Speaker B:** Like, okay, wait a minute. All right, you just gave me a clue to something that they didn't know before. Let me process that with you a bit. Okay, you said that they, when you read it, it looked like they had an ambitious schedule, right? Okay, Westerners love schedule. Wat Sohammo didn't have any schedule. We have schedules for retreats, so they basically turned the daily schedule into a on the street all the time for everybody, which is not the way the Watts should run. And more than likely, many of the nobles will do as little of that schedule as they can get away with. And I invite you to do the same thing: do enough of the schedule to fit in, but not enough to go take a hike. They've got land there. Go barefoot, wander around, further from the buildings the better. Watch every step you take, and that will do just fine. What they don't want, and what they will check for, is people laying in their room on the bed. That's when they'll say something. But if you're out wandering around especially walking barefoot, they'll leave you alone pretty.

**Speaker A:** Much. What, how, uh, how difficult, or is there many English people or Westerners in Thai wats like now? Like, is it difficult to go to Thailand and just stay?

**Speaker B:** Well, uh, let us say that 40 and 50 years ago, 30 years ago, The answer to that was yes. But nowadays, not so much. And what has happened is that the Westerners were coming and willy-nilly going everywhere, all over the place, many of them becoming monks and also becoming disasters. And so they started to put some organization into it. In fact, Ajahn Chah was the leader of the organizational part. That also was part of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa and Wat Soan Mokkh, and now is under the regime of the Bureau of Religious Affairs in Thailand. Now, the Bureau of Religious Affairs is a very, very special kind of government body, because it has a whole lot of bureaucrats that take care of all the paperwork, but all of the faces of that are monks, and they're the ones who make all the decisions and everything like like that, including about visas and who gets a religious visa for how long. So that begins to mean something. They don't want monks to show up in some podunk place and raise havoc there. They want, in fact, for the monks to go to established places. So in fact, guess where several of them are? I don't know all of them, but I do know that Wat Phra Bang in Udon Ratchasima and its sister, the Western Wat, Pananachat, is the number one place to go. The second number place to go is to Wat Suan No, especially we've got an Arhat here, Dhammarato, set up specifically for.

**Speaker A:** Westerners. And is it like, is it difficult to, uh, like, um Is it difficult financially to stay at a wat, or can you just fly into Thailand and just stay out for a while and something like that?

**Speaker B:** You know what I mean? Actually, the money you need will be for your greed and your visa. The visa is the cheaper part. The money is for your greed. Just because you walked into a wat doesn't mean your greed is completely free. No, you want to walk back out of that wat, go get a meal at a restaurant, and leave the to do that, even though you may or may not have food at the wat. If you're at Wat Suwan Mokkh, then there will be breakfast where the monks are. If you're at Wat Damkiam, you'll go out on the bundhabad with the head monk, Ajahn Metta. That's where you'll get fed, but you'll still want to sneak off the property and go to the restaurant. Okay. That's just how things are. And so yes, in Thailand, in fact, now it's becoming easier that the visas have been much more relaxed because of COVID And so things are beginning to open up, and they're already starting retreats again at the International Dhamma Hermitage, which is the big retreat center, which operates mostly for Thai people, but they also have a 10-day retreat for Westerners that have about 100 people. Now, the population is down in the 20s and 30s, but in the next year or two, it'll be back up to 100 to 150. And then on this island, there's another retreat center. I'm not sure, it depends upon how you our friends with Anthony Markwell, because people do stay there, and they just stay with him. And he'll provide the food out of the donations of all of the other students, and you can help out around the place. The same thing, by the way, is true over at Deepakawan on the island of Koh Samui next door. Where Achan Poh is staying. So that would be— and so going around from place to place, so you stay at Wat Suannok and you stay at Wat Khao Tom, and then you stay at, uh, uh, uh, Indara Retreat Center, and then you go to Deepa Bhavana and stay there, and then you come and spend a week or two on my front porch, and everything is.

**Speaker A:** Easy. Yeah, this is, uh, this has actually been a kind of, uh, in my mind, it's It's a little bit of a struggle sometimes in the sense of how do I, how do I get this straight, like realistically and unrealistically.

**Speaker B:** You've got to meet some friends who know where the place to put the hole in the door to put their thumb in so that they can pull the latch and out you.

**Speaker A:** Go. I don't have many of those friends right now.

**Speaker B:** Well, you've got at least.

**Speaker A:** One. It's a bit frustrating when I, like, everywhere I am around, like, I'm in London right now and it's just such a starvation of what I'm trying to find around me. And I just want to go to a place where I can really practice and get solidified and grounded and understand things and just, you know, without all this other strain on my mind.

**Speaker B:** I have two things for you to do that have the same goal. That is, number one, Thai restaurants in London know about Anagarhant and the Thai network in London that you don't know about, because you haven't been to any of the Thai restaurants or any of the Thai Wats. Now, one of the things that I know is one of the really big Thai restaurants in London is a strong, strong supporter of Anagarhama. And one of the things they do is they maintain a flat, or an apartment, in London that's a hangout place for monks and lay people to come and go. That in fact, any time that a monk has to travel, they always come from Hemel Hempstead down to stay in this apartment, and then book their flights and leave. And so people will be there for a week or two or something like that. It's a really interesting hangout place, but be willing to understand that it's Thai, and the Westerners who are there are doing it the Thai style, which means if you want to sleep there, you're going to have to maybe find a spot on the floor to do it, because the floor may be in fact pretty crowded already.

**Speaker A:** What's the name of the restaurant? Maybe I can stop by later.

**Speaker B:** I don't know, it's been 35 years and so I don't remember, but I'm saying that things have got to be better now than they were 35 years.

**Speaker A:** Ago. Okay, maybe I'll find some.

**Speaker B:** Even more organized now than it was then. And all of this just sits right under the nose of the Westerners and they don't have a clue about what they're, you know, Thai and the Asian people are doing. But a lot of Westerners do. That's why there's so many Westerners at Anapanasati, is because that place has been publicized, because there is Western. They had a Western abbot for many years, Arhat Samatha. But that's not the only Thai wat in your area. I think there's 3 or 4 wats in London. And they'll all know each.

**Speaker A:** Other. Yeah, I think it's like Chidhurst and all these other ones that are— Chidhurst.

**Speaker B:** Is down south, that's not in London. Chidhurst is down in the, uh, in the Moors, down on the south coast, and that's also part of Anagarhati, closely connected. Monastery on its own now, but back then it was just a hangout joint. There's also one for women. I don't remember where it is because it didn't exist when I was there, but it does now. So there's a nunnery someplace in the UK. And all of this has a mixture of Western and Thai flavor. The Thai people really support it. In fact, there's another support And that is the Sri Lankans. When Amravati was established, their primary support was Sri Lankans. That may not be the case now, depending upon what the Sri Lankans may have their own— what, in the London area. But it's still closely tied, closely connected with this high Western system that I'm telling you about, that was established through Ajahn Chah in the early '80s. I mean, it was hugely well established by.

**Speaker A:** 1985, I would say. Yeah, I guess I'm picking up the message of what you're saying in one sense is be enthusiastic and express yourself that you really want to understand the Dhamma and make friends with people at the wat and stuff like that, because that's what I'm hoping.

**Speaker B:** For.

**Speaker A:** It's just that I'm very new to this, you know, so I don't have a clue what I'm doing and I.

**Speaker B:** So you're afraid, I know, afraid of the unknown. Everybody's afraid, everybody's a victim. Come on, toughen up, you can handle this. They're Buddhist.

**Speaker A:** Already. Yeah, it is, it is a fear, I suppose. It's just a fear of, uh, it's like a fear of I wouldn't. It's like I won't.

**Speaker B:** Well, take it. Take a deep breath. Find where that fear is, because it's not really.

**Speaker A:** Important. The real actual, the real, and it's like this irritation that's under it all. It's just this This, like, to go from these Watts, or to get to Watts, and to travel to Watts, I have to work, and then I have to get a job, and then I have to go into this whole other— I have to go into this whole.

**Speaker B:** Other thing, and then I'm— Who told you you have to get a job? Huh? I mean, besides the whole society, all your teachers, your parents, and all of those kind of people, who told you you have to have a job?

**Speaker A:** I gotta travel, I gotta travel, you know, like, with the— ear to ear.

**Speaker B:** Oh, you want to travel and you want the money, okay. But nobody's ever told you you've got to have a.

**Speaker A:** Job, right?

**Speaker B:** Then in fact, a one-way ticket from England to Bangkok, it's not all that expensive. Then you can add $60 and get on my front porch, and after.

**Speaker A:** That Wow, that's very inviting. Yeah, I will. What I was thinking is after I stay at Anagarati for a while, I might really have different, maybe, direction in my heart, you know what I mean? Like something like this, or my experience. That's what I'm feeling, because right now.

**Speaker B:** I feel like I'm just— I would highly recommend, because it's the cheapest thing that you could do, is to go to the nearest, or the, let's say, the best known or the biggest Thai restaurants and have a cup of coffee and take a look around and ask if anybody there knows anything about Anagami. And if they say yes, then you can order something to eat. And if they say no, take a hike. I mean, this is really easy to do. You don't even have to go anyplace. And I bet if you play that bet game, you'll wind up finding out where that hangout place is, which means that then you can get free transportation to, uh, uh, Himmelhamstad. I'm thinking really cheap now. All you have to do is just show up at that place and say, "Hey, I'd like to get up here to Amravati. You got anybody going up there anytime soon?" And somebody say, "Yeah, tomorrow afternoon we're.

**Speaker A:** Leaving." That would be really perfect. If that happens, I'll just be mind blown, Dhammarato.

**Speaker B:** I'll.

**Speaker A:** Think, I'll run around today actually and see if there's any. That'll be really interesting. I never had that, even I've never even thought about something like that.

**Speaker B:** I know, but I think that way because I've been there, done that. I know the Thai community. There's nothing to fear but the fear itself that you keep on going. The irritation is an old habit. It's not coming from the Thai people. In fact, it's coming from your thoughts about the Thai people. You're manufacturing it all. So why don't you manufacture something better than that? Like I do. Oh, Thai people are good people.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, it's actually— I just It's literally like I'd rather just sit back, try to do it all on my own and make money and do it on my own instead of getting involved with people, like I'm making friends because of the fear of being unaccepted by the people themselves. I'd rather just do it on my own. That's my irritation.

**Speaker B:** But your unacceptance and your fear of unacceptance is an old thing that happened to you in childhood. And there's no reason to hang on to fear of non-acceptance, that you're acceptable. You're acceptable to me. The only person you're not acceptable to is you. And when you change your attitude and accept yourself, then you'll figure out how people will too. They'll accept you before you.

**Speaker A:** Will. Yeah, yeah, I just— I'm going to just really get involved and see what happens, I think.

**Speaker B:** All right, yeah, I mean, the only thing that could happen is you drowned in happiness, right?

**Speaker A:** Okay, I would love to try it. I would love to try it after this. Right, okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. I mean, other than what we've talked about, how would you get to Hamelham stood anywhere? Do you own a car?

**Speaker A:** No, I was thinking about trying— I was thinking about walking as far as I could tomorrow morning and getting a bus or a train if it's too much because I have two big-ass backpacks, you know.

**Speaker B:** Oh, that's the hard.

**Speaker A:** Way. Yeah, it is the heartbreak.

**Speaker B:** That's a hard.

**Speaker A:** One.

**Speaker B:** But I— Even that, just getting there, sounds like an irritation.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, it's not, it's annoying, because the backpacks really weigh on your body. Sleep is nice, at least. At least the sleep at nighttime is nice, get to pull those backpacks off. But yeah, that's what I'm thinking about.

**Speaker B:** So you've got internet, the easy thing to do is go for Google and start with the word London, and then the next word is Thai, and then the next word would be Buddhism or restaurant or things like that, and go find out what's in the community in London.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna do that actually today. I never thought about that. Anagami, Arahant, or— Yeah, maybe I can find some others.

**Speaker B:** I mean, call around some of those restaurants and say, "Hey, I'm trying to get up to Amravati in Hemel Hempstead. Do you have any way of getting there?" See, I mean, you might be able to do that on the phone.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** You'll spend a lot less time on the phone than you will hoping to get up the road.

**Speaker A:** I really hope so because it's a, uh, yeah, it's like, I don't know how many, it's like 2.5-3 hour walk.

**Speaker B:** It is way out there in the.

**Speaker A:** Sticks. Yeah, from Berkhamsted to the actual monastery or the wat is like, uh, it seems like a, what you call it, a, uh, what's the word, nook and cranny kind of scenario.

**Speaker B:** That's what it is.

**Speaker A:** Right, anyway.

**Speaker B:** I'm looking forward— Well, I wish you the best of luck. I think that you can do this. I'd really like to hear about it after you get there. When are you planning? I mean, if you got nothing else to do, you just put this plan in motion and just go start with it.

**Speaker A:** Oh yeah, yeah, it's tomorrow. I'll be there tomorrow. I just got into London. Yesterday, so yeah, I'll be there tomorrow and yeah, I'm looking forward to seeing what happens. Yeah, I'd love to talk to you about it soon. I'm not sure how to— I did ask them about internet and Wi-Fi and how you can use phones and computers and basically they said that we want you to— it's not encouraged but we do let people use stuff like that, but there's no Wi-Fi or stuff.

**Speaker B:** But okay, well, they probably would not, uh, be discouraged about you calling me.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Speaker B:** They would be discouraged about just general internet use. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You want to have a Skype call with your Anagami teacher, and that's an interesting induction to a conversation. You might in fact get one of the friends come join the conversation with you.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that would be cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe, maybe I can maybe get down to the town nearby if I have to get internet or something. But yeah, I'll definitely call or talk to you soon about it and see how things go.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. Well, I'm really curious now about what's going to happen. So, Bhikkhu, when you find out?

**Speaker A:** Me too.

**Speaker B:** All right, well, we'll see you later.

**Speaker A:** All right, I'll see you. Great, great.

**Speaker B:** See you. Okay, bye-bye. Bye-bye.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk is a practical and encouraging conversation between a student (Speaker A) who is about to visit Amaravati Monastery and the teacher Dhammarato (Speaker B). Here is a summary of the key themes and advice:

### **Core Themes & Advice:**

1.  **Seeking Noble Companionship:** The student expresses a desire to immerse himself in a practice environment and connect with sincere, noble-minded practitioners ("noble people") at the monastery.

2.  **Navigating the Modern Sangha:** Dhammarato provides crucial context. He explains that while Amaravati was founded by the esteemed Thai Forest Tradition (Ajahn Chah), the community now includes many Western monks who may not have deep roots in that original, potent lineage. He likens the situation to the time of King Ashoka, where rapid growth can dilute the depth of teaching.
    *   **Key Advice:** Be discerning. Just because someone is in robes doesn't automatically mean they are a profound source of Dhamma. Investigate.

3.  **How to Find Guidance:** Dhammarato offers a clear strategy:
    *   **Go directly to the Abbot:** The abbot, as a senior monk, is most likely to be connected to the original lineage and understanding. He is the safest refuge for good guidance.
    *   **Signal Your Intent:** Tell the abbot you are interested in the "supramundane noble teachings" and mention **Bhikkhu Buddhadasa** (a highly respected Thai reformist monk). This signals you are seeking deep Dhamma, not just cultural ritual.
    *   **Identify Noble Qualities:** Look for monks who:
        *   Are genuinely, joyfully interested **only in the Dhamma** (not in administration, rules for rules' sake, or other topics).
        *   Are **enthusiastic and delighted** by the Dhamma (exhibiting *nandi* or bliss).
        *   Are **not bossy or on a power trip**. A true noble's behavior is naturally virtuous, not enforced.

4.  **Practical and Attitudinal Tips:**
    *   **Schedule:** Don't feel compelled to follow a rigid Western-style schedule rigidly. Do enough to fit in, but prioritize your practice (e.g., mindful walking barefoot on the grounds).
    *   **Overcoming Fear & Irritation:** The student admits to fear of the unknown and social anxiety. Dhammarato identifies this as self-created, old conditioning.
    *   **Key Advice:** "The only person you're not acceptable to is you." Change your attitude, accept yourself, and engage with joy and enthusiasm.
    *   **Resourcefulness:** Dhammarato suggests tapping into the local **Thai community** (e.g., Thai restaurants in London) which often supports the monastery and may offer practical help like transportation or connections.

5.  **Broader Vision:** The conversation expands to the student's longer-term hopes of practicing in Thailand. Dhammarato outlines a potential path, naming specific monasteries and retreat centers (Wat Suan Mokkh, Wat Pah Nanachat, etc.) that are welcoming to Westerners seeking serious practice, and even humorously invites him to his porch.

### **Overall Summary:**

This is a talk about **how to skillfully seek authentic Dhamma guidance within a modern, institutional Buddhist setting.** Dhammarato empowers the student with both pragmatic strategies (talk to the abbot, mention key names) and the essential **attitude** of joyful, discerning inquiry. The core message is to not be naive about the community's diversity, to proactively seek out the noble-hearted, and, most importantly, to cultivate the self-acceptance and enthusiasm that will attract the right guidance and make the practice fruitful.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the primary speaker (Speaker B, likely a teacher or guide) uses several key metaphors and stories to illustrate their advice. Here are the main ones:

### 1. **The "Crapshoot" or "Wide Variety" Metaphor**
   *   **What it is:** Speaker B repeatedly compares the community at Amaravati (and Western Buddhist monasteries in general) to a gamble or a mixed bag.
   * **Purpose:** To caution Speaker A that not everyone in a monk's robe is necessarily an advanced or "noble" practitioner. It emphasizes the need for discernment, suggesting the environment contains a spectrum of individuals with different levels of understanding and motivation.

### 2. **The Story of King Ashoka and the Dilution of the Dharma**
   *   **What it is:** Speaker B recounts the historical example of the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka, who massively spread Buddhism across India after his conversion.
   *   **Purpose:** To draw a direct parallel to the modern situation in the West. The story illustrates how rapid growth and popularity can "spread the Dharma thin," overwhelming the small number of truly accomplished teachers (the "500 noble monks") with a flood of new students. This leads to a dilution of quality teaching. The metaphor warns that Amaravati may be experiencing a similar dynamic after the death of its founder, Ajahn Chah.

### 3. **The "Lineage" and "Rot Away" Metaphor**
   *   **What it is:** Speaker B uses an organic metaphor, suggesting the original lineage from Ajahn Chah was small and is now at risk of decaying or being diluted ("start to rot away").
   *   **Purpose:** To explain why finding a direct connection to the original source (through the senior abbot) is crucial. The implication is that the "roots" or "trunk" of the tree (the original lineage holders) are strong, but the further one gets from them, the more the quality may decline.

### 4. **The "Refuge" Metaphor (used in a specific, investigative way)**
   *   **What it is:** While "taking refuge" is a standard Buddhist concept, Speaker B uses it as a **litmus test**. A true *Sotāpanna* (stream-entered) doesn't just formally take refuge; their life and conversation are *actually about* and *joyfully immersed in* the Dharma.
   *   **Purpose:** To give Speaker A concrete signs to look for: Does the person care *only* about the Dhamma? Are they joyful and enthusiastic about it? This becomes a tool for investigation, moving beyond external appearances (robes) to internal qualities.

### 5. **The "Power Game" vs. "Dharma Interest" Contrast**
   *   **What it is:** This is a metaphorical framework for judging behavior. Speaker B contrasts monks who are in a "power game" (bossy, seeing the robe as a position of importance) with those whose sole interest is the Dharma.
   *   **Purpose:** To help Speaker A identify who might be an "ordinary" person versus a "noble" one. It frames spiritual authority not in terms of hierarchy but in terms of genuine, selfless dedication.

### 6. **The "Hole in the Door" Metaphor**
   *   **What it is:** A brief, vivid metaphor: "You've got to meet some friends who know where the place to put the hole in the door to put their thumb in so that they can pull the latch and out you go."
   *   **Purpose:** To illustrate the importance of **inside knowledge and community**. It suggests that the practical path (getting to monasteries, finding support) isn't always obvious or publicly advertised; you need connections ("friends") who know the informal systems and shortcuts.

### 7. **The "Manufacturing" Metaphor for Fear**
   *   **What it is:** Speaker B tells Speaker A that his irritation and fear about engaging with the Thai community are not coming from the people themselves, but from his own thoughts. He is "manufacturing" the obstacle.
   *   **Purpose:** To shift the locus of the problem from the external world to the internal mind. It encourages Speaker A to stop producing negative narratives and instead "manufacture something better," like positive expectations and openness.

### Summary:
The core metaphors and stories serve a unified purpose: to equip Speaker A with a **discriminating mindset** for navigating a complex spiritual community. They warn against naive idealism (via the "crapshoot" and Ashoka stories), provide tools for discernment (the "refuge" litmus test, the "power game" contrast), and encourage proactive, community-savvy engagement (the "hole in the door" metaphor, the advice to seek out the Thai network). The historical analogy of Ashoka provides the most extended narrative, framing the entire situation in a larger, cyclical pattern of Buddhist expansion and dilution.
