### Transcript


**Speaker A:** It's just another Saturday morning. One thing that I will say is, is that the other night— in fact, I think that it was Wednesday night, which would be the same night for Eric— what is there was a lot of chest pain, sharp chest pain running up and down through here. And the day before, I had stayed in the shower long enough to do a standing shower and a shave, and had gotten really tired, and my shoulder was hurting. And so, that night, laying in bed, after the results of the election, I was telling myself I was having a heart attack. You know, all of the symptoms and all of that kind of stuff. And guess what? All of that pain went away. But all during that time of pain, then in fact, I really wasn't worried about having a heart attack. Wasn't worried about anything at all, other than I knew that maybe the heart attack pain sensations that I was feeling was a collective pain from the US. It had somehow transmitted itself, and I got it right in here. But happily to say, the pain has gone down, and I would hope that the pain has gone away for the Americans. But I hear Eric telling me that he's still in pain, so I'm going to hand it over to Eric now and give us a load of it. Eric.

**Speaker B:** Uh, so as I was saying, uh, he— Trump has promised to, uh, destroy the American government. I mean, he's already promised to use the military to, uh, take revenge on his enemies. He's promised to weaponize the Justice Department to— uh, he's going to fire all these— he, he's, he's out— he's been, uh convicted of a felony, multiple felonies, and he's not going to face any consequences. It's looking very dark.

**Speaker A:** And no, you're looking very dull. It's just happening. This is an important point that we can make for today, is that all of your pain is between your ears. So let's get started with this. How many of you have heard that Donald Trump is famous for lying? 30,000 or so during the past administration, and they lost count in the last 4 years. Okay. And so now, Eric, you're all upset because Trump is saying, oh, I promise, I promise this, and I promise that. Well, guess what? What happens in a marriage ceremony? Don't people vow to stay with each other for the rest of their lives? Then why is the divorce rate so high? More than 50% and still climbing after all of these years. In other words, Nick, you do not know the future. All you know is the stuff that you have heard. This is a Dhamma session today. This is not about politics. This is about how to clean the politics and the other wax in your ears out. That in fact, you, Eric, would be a whole lot better off if you had not been given A very dirty gift that your dad has given you. Now, you imagine how bad you feel right now. Is he still alive? Did he make it this far after the election?

**Speaker B:** No, he's been deceased for 15 years.

**Speaker A:** Well, he's the lucky one then, isn't he? So he gave you— Yeah, yeah, he gave you the hot potato, and now you're the one that's suffering. So, let's go in this direction for a little while. How many people do you think in the U.S. are suffering right now? Something like what, close to 50% of all the voters?

**Speaker B:** Millions. Millions of people are really making it.

**Speaker A:** Millions and millions and millions and millions of people are really unhappy right now; is that not the case?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, there's a lot of homeless people, a lot of starved, you know, starving people, people in real misery. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. Okay. Is your misery added to that crowd going to help anything? No. No. Okay. So why can't you make your misery optional? Because your misery is not going to help you, and it's not going to help any of those people you just mentioned. And a whole lot more. Agreed. Agreed. Okay, that's the whole point, is that your suffering right now is optional. And I'm using the word suffering intentionally because sometimes our dissatisfaction gets to the point of being overwhelming. Okay, so the next point is, is that how many of those people who are out there suffering that you just mentioned actually want to do something about it?

**Speaker B:** I am— I don't, I don't know. I don't know what to think.

**Speaker A:** All right, how many of them— I mean, if you've been following YouTube at all, look how many people have been on MSNBC, look how many people have been on NBC, look how many people have been on Midas Touch and other broadcasters, and they're out there saying, "We're going to stop Trump no matter what." So there's quite a lot of opposition to whatever Trump is planning on doing. Is that not the case?

**Speaker B:** [Speaker:Damarato] That is the case, but yet he has the football.

**Speaker A:** You don't know what kind of balls he has.

**Speaker B:** The football is a briefcase that has the nuclear codes in it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, OK.

**Speaker B:** He can order the release of nuclear weapons at any time.

**Speaker A:** Yes, but so could have Biden, and so could have Trump before that, and so could have this, that, and the other thing. I think, in fact, that the story is, is Clinton actually lost track of that football. But in fact, footballs and nuclear weapons is a tactic of fear, not of war. Look how many wars have happened since World War II, and not one nuclear weapon has ever gone off so far. I'll take that. I'll take it as fear. Now the question is, why are you afraid, Eric? Don't you recognize that your fear is optional?

**Speaker B:** I disagree. I think it's a good thing to be afraid of, that he actually in the course of his last administration asked why not use the nuclear weapons. He's capable of doing it. He is capable of doing it. And we're closer to nuclear armageddon than we've ever been.

**Speaker A:** Let's spend just a moment talking about that. He's going to use nuclear weapons where? Is he going to blow up the Moon?

**Speaker B:** Maybe Iran.

**Speaker A:** Maybe Iran, OK. Are you in Iran?

**Speaker B:** No, I am not.

**Speaker A:** OK. So, why are you afraid that Trump's going to nuke Iran?

**Speaker B:** Well, I believe we're on the verge of World War III, and chances are that Iran's allies would retaliate with nuclear weapons against us.

**Speaker A:** Andrew, how long now have we been on the verge of World War III? For me, something like my whole life. For the past 75 or more years, we've been on the verge of World War III. And we haven't been in World War III yet.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, we never had a crazy bastard with a football yet.

**Speaker A:** Yes, we did. We had him for 4 years. And we had a crazy bastard since then called Biden. And we had a crazy bastard before that called Obama. And everybody who's in office is called crazy bastard by half the people.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think his first administration was just a warm-up. I think he's really gonna— he's really gonna let go this time. But your point is good. We don't know the future. He could just be lying about all that stuff.

**Speaker A:** Well, and he's gonna— might have an awful lot of opposition to it. One of the things that I expected you to say is that Russia's going to nuke us, us being Americans. And the answer to that is, is that nobody's sure that Russia's nukes nuke. In fact, Putin's the one who has been threatening nuking, and he hasn't been doing any nuking. And even in the Bible they say wars and rumors of wars. There are always more rumors of wars than there are actually wars. Is this not the case?

**Speaker B:** Agreed.

**Speaker A:** Okay, let's get some agreement here. Is that rumors of wars are designed to make people prayed. Agreed. Okay. And is this not what, let us say, talking about media in all forms, including broadcast media, cable media, video, YouTube, and all kinds of web media? And the whole point about media is to stay in business, right? How many media places that spend all of those millions of dollars getting their license and their studios and their advertisers and their audience just want to make one announcement? They don't want to make one announcement, they want to make an announcement every day. And they want to make an important announcement so people will listen every day. In other words, they sell something. Mikey, what is it that media sells? Lies.

**Speaker C:** Huh?

**Speaker A:** Rumors, lies, rumors, and most importantly, fear. They shall fear. Guess what, Eric? You've bought a potload of it.

**Speaker B:** Well, you know, I think the fact.

**Speaker C:** That.

**Speaker B:** Trump seems to be in Putin's pocket is something to be afraid of. He is He has exhibited public treason behavior.

**Speaker A:** [Speaker:Dhammarato] A lot of Trump is too fat to go in Putin's pocket, and if he did, Putin would fall over with the weight. And there's a whole lot of people would be cutting on Putin's pocket while Trump was trying to climb in. You see, if you want to think about it like this, there actually is a war going on, and the war that is going on is the war of power grabbing. Everybody wants power, and the best way to get power is by making everybody else afraid of you. That's what power is. Has anybody got a better definition of power? Other than making people afraid of you? So, Eric, you really do not know what the future is going to bring. What you do know is, is that right now you're terrified. You bought a whole potload of it.

**Speaker B:** Yes, I did.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, okay. Is there anybody else who bought a potload of fear? How about some of you guys who were Dharma dudes who can say, I don't need to be afraid right now because I don't see that nuclear bomb coming in my direction right now? And so let's stay in the here now. And in the here now, things are pretty safe. Eric, are you safe right now?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I am safe and warm.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, safe and warm. Do you feel safe?

**Speaker B:** Yes, I feel very safe.

**Speaker A:** Oh, I'm surprised at that from what I've told you. Been hearing from you today. So what that actually means now, that if you're actually feeling safe, because maybe I've said some stuff that's put you back into reality, if you feel safe now and you are safe now, isn't that in fact living in reality, at least in that aspect?

**Speaker B:** Yes, it is.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so if you have thoughts of, oh, he's in Putin's pocket, or, oh, he's going to say he's got the football, he's going to set off the codes, oh, he's going to round up all of these millions of people— do you know how much trouble is going to be and how much opposition is going to be to round up all the illegals? I mean, my goodness, have you ever heard of the abolitionists? There's going to be an illegal under every bed and California. Have you ever heard of Schindler?

**Speaker B:** Yes.

**Speaker A:** They made a list on him, or he had a list. Okay, here's the point, is that as many as the Holocaust victims as Hitler got, he missed a whole bunch of them, because a whole bunch of them were hiding between the rafters in every house in Berlin. In other words, Trump's going to have an awful lot of opposition. Why can't you let all of those who are opposed to Trump do whatever they want to do with Trump? Because you're adding your weight to whatever it is, either simply by being on their side or simply by being afraid like they are. It's not going to help. And I would certainly not, uh, recommend you go off and do something crazy on your own, like go to a gun store, etc. That's crazy talk. And what that really means is, is that you're delusional with fear because you really don't know what the future is going to bring. I mean, as far as I could tell, the only thing that's happened since the election is the stock market's gone up. Well, it was going up during Biden's time and his It's still going up. So there really is nothing to fear, except fear itself. And so here is where the real Dharma comes in. If you can see that you're having thoughts about politics, or about Christian nationals, or about nuclear weapons, or whatever the thought that you're having is, that's giving you fear, recognize that that thought is about someplace else and some other time rather than right here, right now. And if you can come back to having thoughts of, well, at least right here, right now, I'm okay, then you're practicing Dhamma. To come back to right here, right now, everything is okay, not a problem in the world, even though the nuclear ICBMs are in the air, who knows where they'll land, or if they'll land, who knows if they'll go off or not, who knows what other ICBMs are in the air. We don't know any of that kind of stuff. But what happens is fear, in fact, fear is something about the future. We have fear and dread about something that may happen. And most of the things that people fear actually never happen. Let's give an example of that. When I was in, let us say, the 5th grade, the school that I went to, the principal was a paddling maniac, and everybody in school was afraid of this dude. And one time, I and 3 or 4 or 5 other kids were playing marbles at the far, far end of the schoolyard. The school was so far away, the principal had to have had binoculars to see us playing. Marbles, but we were on school ground. And so he sent some teacher out there to round us up, to take us back to the principal's office because we had broken a rule. And what was the rule that we broke? That when the kids— when school is out, the kids have to leave the school grounds. And so all 4 or 5 of us are heading into the office, all terrified about getting the paddling. Guess what? I was like the last one who got the paddling, and the teacher, or the principal, was already tired by then, and that paddling didn't hardly mean a thing to me. I was more terrified of getting that paddling than the actual paddling itself. Nothing to it. And he was the kind of guy that used a great big flat board that had holes drilled in it. They say that the holes drilled in it makes blisters. And I survived! If I can survive that battling in the 5th grade, I can survive anything! Well, guess what? Last Tuesday, when Trump was elected, Eric, you survived, didn't you? Eric, didn't you survive? Didn't you? I mean, maybe he's dead now.

**Speaker B:** I think I just, uh, I died a little bit, you know. I just died a little bit that day.

**Speaker A:** Well, you didn't die a little bit, but you were terrified quite a lot. A sinking feeling. Oh no. Well, guess what? All of those thoughts that you had when you found out that Trump had won, how many of those things have happened since then? I bet not a one. And yeah, go ahead.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, your point is good. You know, he terrified me. He got power over me by terrifying me effectively. Of course, he's got a track record, and it was certainly very stressful putting up with his first 4 years. But the fact is, you make good points. Like, hopefully there will be opposition. Hopefully McConnell will actually be his greatest opponent.

**Speaker C:** But.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think it's a good point. But I think he's clearly a troublemaker. He wants to make trouble. He has the power to make trouble, and he's a big liar. So it's a good point. We don't know, but we have good reason to be afraid.

**Speaker A:** But Eric, you're a troublemaker. You're in the business, you were trained by your dad to be a troublemaker. And guess what? You're giving yourself more trouble than Donald Trump ever gave you. And it's time you stop giving yourself trouble. Hear, hear.

**Speaker B:** I'm so tired of myself.

**Speaker A:** Yeah. So every time Donald Trump comes to mind, Kick him out, saying everything is okay right now, there's not a problem in the world. Every time you think about your bank, say, I'm okay now, I don't need the bank, I don't need to think about the bank. Whatever your favorite pain, whatever your favorite fear, become aware of that. Eric, you know now that you're terrified of Donald Trump, so you have to start being on guard. Every time Donald Trump comes up, you have to remember that you're okay and that he can't harm you. Only you can harm you. You and your own stupidity.

**Speaker B:** Well, you know, he killed 400,000 people unnecessarily when COVID came around. He's heard a lot of people, and.

**Speaker A:** He'S— let us say this, you can't say it that way and get away with it with me. What you can say is, when COVID came, a whole lot of people listened to a whole lot of fools and took very little protection, and they killed themselves. Others, like nurses— in fact, a lot of nurses died because they were so goody-two-shoes, they're out there helping all of those COVID people, and they died from COVID too.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, well, a lot of elderly people who were vulnerable to conditions that beyond their control, beyond their comprehension, got murdered, you know, by his negligence and— and.

**Speaker A:** They weren't murdered by his negligence. They weren't murdered by him at all. Whatever he did, they died of an illness, and a lot of those elderlies would have died anyway. And in fact, it's quite possible that it was easy when elderlies were dying, just to blame COVID for it, rather than the incompetence of the facility workers. So the point is, is that we Have you ever heard the expression of, uh, there are three kinds of lies: lies, damn lies, and statistics?

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, the 400,000 that you're quoting me right now is statistics. And look how bad you feel about statistics. The fact is, is you survived those statistics. The next point is to at least look at this direction for a moment. I was an old, old man during COVID and I didn't die. You know why? Because I stayed mostly in seclusion. A lot of you will verify, and Mikey can verify right now, that I don't leave this porch. And so COVID had to travel really hard to get to me. But being in a facility where COVID is spreading around, that's a good likelihood for people to get COVID. So the right thing to do when COVID is spreading around is get away from people, especially those that got COVID. They killed each other, they sneezed on each other, they coughed on each other. They cried on each other's shoulders about COVID and they killed each other. And Donald Trump was sitting in the Oval Office, just fat, stupid, dumb, and dumber. Certainly wasn't happy. That's the one thing about him that we can count on. That's the one thing that he does not lie about. He is an unhappy, unhappy, unhappy dude. And you don't have to be, because you've got a choice. And so I would recommend everybody here who has thoughts of Trump to throw those thoughts out of your mind, because by doing so, you're throwing unhappiness right out of your mind. Whenever you throw Trump out of your mind, you're throwing Fear out of your mind. Let's get rid of that stuff. Let's come back to the present moment. You're okay. That's the real point, is that when you— Eric, I have heard you blame Trump for a dozen things already. He killed this many people, he killed that many people. He didn't kill them, COVID killed them. He's going to deport all the illegals. Bet not. I bet when he starts the roundup, he can't find hardly one or two illegals, and only those are really stupid enough to get caught. Everybody else is going to be under some liberal's bed. Yes, officer, there are no illegals in this house. So there's going to be a lot of opposition to Donald Trump. Let them oppose Donald Trump as best they can, because you know that all of those millions and millions of people, maybe 50% of the adult population, who hate Trump are full of hatred all on their own. They don't need Eric, they don't need you, Patrick, they don't need you, Alex, to help them to be miserable, uptight, afraid, and full of hate. You have a choice. Every minute you have a choice. Every moment you have a choice to throw him out of your mind. But that message that I'm giving you now has just got a name on it, a label, a face of Trump on it. You can think of that instead as every unwholesome thought that you can come up with. So you can have your sister on your mind being full of hatred. Then you can throw that thought out. You can have your neighbor on your mind, full of hatred— throw that thought out. The world is full of objects that are worthy of your hatred, but there are also the same exact number of objects in the world that don't mean a thing to you. Except that you care. So stop caring. You're okay. You're already okay. Not a problem in the world. You don't have to worry about what Trump is doing. And actually, just a tad little bit, I'm talking to myself too. Not a worry in the world. Donald Trump can't hurt me. And if you think he can hurt you, come stay on my porch. Come to Thailand. Get away from him. Get away from everything that you think is dangerous. One thing that's absolutely sure, wherever those ICBMs go off, wherever they put nukes, Even if they go way astray from their actual target, they're not going to hit this poor little island. Thailand is on nobody's hit list. They're too busy trying to hate each other. You can leave that alone. You can become distant from it. You can find a way of being in seclusion. So one of the things, Eric, I would recommend is turn off your cell phone, turn off your television, turn off whatever news system that you use, because the news system that you use is intentionally going to lie to you, no matter which team they're on. Kamala Harris was not nearly as bad as the right made her out to be, and Donald Trump is not nearly as stupid and evil as the left make him out to be. Actually evil, stupid, I think they've got that one wired. So does anybody have any questions about this? Gosh, this is an interesting topic that we've chosen for today. Andrew, do you have anything to say?

**Speaker C:** Sorry, having a bit of trouble here. Yeah, no, I've got nothing to say. I'm just walking through the city at the moment.

**Speaker A:** You're just walking through the city? Is that a safe city? Are you safe?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I'm pretty safe.

**Speaker A:** Do you feel safe?

**Speaker C:** Yeah, I feel safe.

**Speaker A:** All right, if you start thinking about Donald Trump, will you feel safe?

**Speaker C:** Uh, I try not to think about Donald Trump too much.

**Speaker A:** How about you, Ben?

**Speaker C:** Thank you, Dhammarato.

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker C:** I feel perfectly safe. Thank you.

**Speaker A:** I hear an at least, thank you. What else was that?

**Speaker C:** I feel perfectly safe, thank you.

**Speaker A:** Alex, let me hear it. Are there any ICBMs headed towards Oregon right now? And you're not in Oregon, you're in Vancouver now, right? Yeah, everything is okay here. Everything is all right. Feeling good and safe, feeling comfortable. So Patrick, how about you? Patrick, he's probably so safe and secure he's asleep. Time to doze off. Jonesy, it's good to see you again. Welcome back.

**Speaker D:** Thank you very much. I'm glad to see you're feeling so awake and chipper.

**Speaker A:** I'm not awake and chipper. I am Terrified.

**Speaker D:** Anxiety is a really good stimulant.

**Speaker A:** I don't need that kind of stimulant. I got other kinds of stimulants, like happy thoughts. Everything's going to be all right. Not a worry in the world.

**Speaker D:** You came in with such Intense language. I don't even doubt that. No, thankfully, I stressed myself out about both parties way before the election and already calmed myself about it. Thank you very much. You helped me with that 3 months ago.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, that's right, Eric. You should have had these kind of No mind. I think that the big issue is everybody is surprised, because at the last minute NBC and MSNBC and others were saying that Donald Trump is falling apart, nobody's going to his rallies or anything like that. And so they had set us up for Kamala Harris winning. And then the big surprise was that, in fact, there's still a whole lot of people who are digging through all kinds of papers and whatnot, because they still don't believe that Donald Trump won the election. I think, in fact, we'll have a cult; there'll be a new religion. Donald Trump Anagami deniers. A new cult will get formed, all because people don't believe it, because we were all, let us say, primed by the media that Harris was going to win by a landslide. And yet, nobody knows. Nobody knows what the future is going to be. Nobody knows what Donald Trump is going to do. All we know is that there's going to be an awful lot of arguing and maybe some shooting in the next month or two. Keep your head down, stay away from the action. That's my advice. Stay away from the action physically and stay away from the action mentally. Just stay away from it because you don't know what's going to happen.

**Speaker B:** Dhammarato, do you know what the Indigos are?

**Speaker A:** Pardon?

**Speaker B:** Are you familiar with the Indigos?

**Speaker A:** Uh, it's a new color. They found it on the prism. Before that, the rainbow didn't have an Indigo.

**Speaker B:** Well.

**Speaker A:** Um, I suppose you mean a group, not a color.

**Speaker B:** Uh, hippies, you know, that we used to have hippies and we used to have this Age of Aquarius thing.

**Speaker A:** And a lot of us know they had one color. I thought there was a color rainbow. Never mind.

**Speaker B:** Spiritually minded, you know, the kind of the newer ages. Some of them are called Indigos and they're kind of like a fringe that are just like, you know, the rainbow people that are just so beautiful that they have to name themselves after the rainbow. Well, you know, we, especially children of the '60s, we have been emotionally invested for 50 years in this notion that the world is going to move forward towards a progressive model that's going to move away from all this division and all this injustice and all the suppression. Of the— and, uh, you know, it turns out that the American public, uh, isn't moving in that direction. Then we just took a huge step backward. The Age of Aquarius that we were hoping— with that, this is the dawn of the Age of Aquarius. It seems that this is— that was.

**Speaker A:** Just a song, I think, by the Mamas and the Papas. Eric, guess what? There is no such thing as the American public. Get over it. There's no such thing as the American public. What you have is, you have— and this is a lie too— you have Gen Z and Gen X and Boomers and Millennials and I don't know whatever groups there are. But those groupings also are statistics; they don't exist. But what we do know from psychology is that young people always start out looking for something. Every child is progressive; every 3-year-old is tearing their toys apart, playing with them, And as we grow up, we are trained by society of conservatives, so that as people grow older and older and older, they grow more and more conservative, unless they've got their brains working. It's a natural process that people get more conservative. And so guess what? All of those hippies of the 1970s are driving around in their BMWs on the way to vote for Donald Trump. That's just the way things are. There's always the new hope, followed by complacency, followed by conservatism. That's the natural way of the world. Another way of saying it is, old men send young men to war. They send the young men to war because the middle-aged men won't have anything to do with it.

**Speaker B:** So my point is, the emotional loss that we've suffered based on the dreams that have been all our lives, You've been lied to.

**Speaker A:** Get over it. Recognize that you've been lied to, and that the only truth, the only real eternal truth, is the Four Noble Truths. That you in fact suffer when you're lied to, whether you believe the lie or not. You suffer when you're lied to, and you suffer when you lie. So the better thing to do is keep looking, keep your eyes open, keep watching, and keep your mouth shut. That's the way of the Buddhas, is don't repeat the stuff you've been told because you don't know whether it's true or not. That's why all of the young, they influence one another, that's why they're all liberals. But they eventually grow old, grow tired, and grow conservative, and grow towards Trump. That's the natural progression. If you can see that in your own life, you've got choices to make. If you can't, you have no choice. But me about— go ahead, Jesse.

**Speaker D:** Is there something about like.

**Speaker A:** Um, not—.

**Speaker D:** Well, maybe it's in that the Buddha like turned away from religion, but is there something in like not believing in necessarily like prophecy or not trusting it or something like that? Because you can't in the suttas or the Pali Canon or something.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, you can't see the future, so any prophecies that are made are made by liars trying to gain power by making you afraid and telling you some prophecy. Either that or they're telling you a story about something they don't know anything about. So I would give no value to any prophecies at all. Especially the ones you yourself make. Don't believe in your own future because you don't know what your own future is going to be. The question is, can you be happy right now? An example of that is that you're walking into the bank. You're walking into the bank with a great big smile on your face and you're really happy when you're walking into the bank. You'll probably have different business and do different things than if you walk into the bank miserable, dejected, and full of fear. If you walk into that bank miserable, dejected, and full of fear, you may do something really stupid in that bank, like pull out your finger painted black. But if you walk into that bank all happy and joyful and everything, everything is going to work out just fine for you in that bank. Now that's true no matter which door you're opening. Whatever door you open, and in fact that's one of the ways that I would recommend to practice the Dhamma. Whenever you start to open a door, check things out. Whenever you open a door, ask yourself, why am I going through this door? Can I do it happily? Am I unhappy? If I'm unhappy, don't go through that door. Every door that you go through, if you're mindful, should be a happy door to go through, not an unhappy door. So this is the way that we start to practice is, and using a door. Another example of that would be a chair. Every time you get out of that chair, know why you're getting out of that chair. Can you get out of that chair happily? Every time you sit down, can you sit down and just sit down and relax, or do you have to sit down grumpily? So use doors and chairs and things like that as a an anchor, or a trigger, so that you can remember that you've got a choice. Every action you take, you've got a choice: are you going to do it happily or unhappily? Having thoughts about Donald Trump? Probably not a good idea. So whenever you have thoughts about Donald Trump, any politics at all, any future, any predictions, any prophecies at all, whether he's the Third Reich or he's the Fourth Reich or he's the next Antichrist and all of that kind of stuff— how many people have been called an Antichrist in the past 2,000 years? And every one of them turned out to be a human being. An Antichrist is just a label, doesn't mean a thing except for the feelings of the person who's using the word. So best not to call anybody a name. Don't call people names. Just let Trump be a Trump. He's the only one who can be. Let him go. He's okay. If you think he's coming from you, make yourself really scarce. When I say that, I'm talking about it in the, uh, Dharma sense. Make yourself, because that's all he— you think he wants is you. And if there's no you there, then he can't touch you because he can't find you. So this is the real Dharma, is just get those kind of thoughts out of the mind and just be happy, because he hasn't sent an ICBM yet. There's been no nuclear wars yet. There's been no roundup of immigrants yet. Leave that yet in your mind. Not yet, not yet. I'll leave you with this one. It's a story, actually, I'll tell you the original story, and that is that a monk was being chased by a lion, and he was not concerned about where he was going so long as he could get away from the lion. And all of a sudden he finds himself at the top of a precipice, and he slips and he falls over the side. And just as he falls, he was able to remind himself that there was a root or a limb there, and he caught a hold of that limb. So he's got the line above him and the precipice below. And there he sees beside him, going out of the side of the precipice, a flower. And so he starts paying attention to the flower, and he says to himself, everything is okay, everything is fine, not a worry in the world, not yet. I haven't fallen yet, the lion hasn't gotten me yet. Well, guess what? The lion got bored and he went off chasing some other monk. So this is the way of starting to live your life, is use that word "not yet." It hasn't happened yet. This is the Dhamma. Stop having thoughts about what might happen and leave it with, "Oh, well, it hasn't happened yet." Everything is okay so far. So far, so good. Not a problem in the world. Eric, guess what? Donald Trump does not know you. He's not coming after you. Eric, guess what? You do not know Donald Trump. You think he's coming after you, to where in fact he don't even know you. Guess what? You're the one who is coming after you. You're the one who is making yourself miserable because of Donald Trump. But the Donald Trump that we're talking about here is not the Donald Trump out there who won the election. We're talking about the Donald Trump between your ears, the one you made up. Not the real one, because who knows what the real one is? It's, uh, wow, if there's anything blowing in the wind, it's the Trump. He's not a fixed object, but when you think of him, you fix him as an object in your mind. And when you see that you're fixing him as an object in your mind, throw him out. That's all you need to do is just to throw him out. You're okay without him. In fact, you're a lot better off without him. In fact, you're a whole lot better off without almost every thought that you've ever had. You're better off without all of those thoughts. So just sit and say, oh, I don't have to think right now. Can let it go, let it relax. That's the Dharma. The Buddha teaches only one thing: Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha. Recognize that you're creating the Dukkha right now with your thoughts of Donald Trump. Throw him out and have the Dukkha, Nirodha. Just relax. You're already okay. No ICBMs in the air. No nukes are coming. No Gestapo is marching in the house. Everything is fine. Wow, what a relief!

### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker A), uses a participant's (Eric/Speaker B) acute anxiety following a U.S. presidential election as a practical lesson in core Buddhist principles. Here is a summary of the key points:

**Core Teaching: Suffering is Optional and Self-Created**
Dhammarato redirects the conversation from politics to Dhamma (the Buddha's teachings). The central theme is that Eric's fear and suffering are not caused by external events (e.g., Donald Trump's election), but by his own thoughts about those events. The pain is "between your ears."

**Main Arguments and Instructions:**

1.  **Uncertainty of the Future:** Dhammarato repeatedly emphasizes that we cannot know the future. Eric's fears are based on predictions, rumors, and promises (which, like marriage vows, are often broken), not on present reality.
2.  **The Role of Media and Fear:** The talk identifies media (news, social media) as a business that sells "lies, rumors, and most importantly, fear." By consuming it, Eric has "bought a potload" of fear.
3.  **Power of the Present Moment:** The practical instruction is to return to the present. Whenever a fearful thought arises, one should check: "Am I safe right now?" Since, in the immediate moment, most are physically safe, they can affirm, "I'm okay now. Not a problem in the world."
4.  **Letting Go and Non-Engagement:** Dhammarato advises mental and physical disengagement. Since Eric's fear doesn't help the millions who are suffering, it is "optional." He should "throw Trump out of his mind" just as he would any unwholesome thought. The instruction extends to turning off news sources.
5.  **The "Not Yet" Practice:** A key technique offered is to replace catastrophic thinking with the phrase "not yet." (e.g., "There has been no nuclear war *yet*"). This acknowledges uncertainty while grounding oneself in the current, still-okay reality.
6.  **The Real Enemy is Internal:** The talk concludes that the "Donald Trump" causing Eric's suffering is not the external person, but the internal mental image and narrative Eric has created and fixated upon. "You're the one who is coming after you."

**Metaphors and Examples:**
*   **The School Paddling:** Dhammarato shares a childhood story where the fear of punishment was worse than the punishment itself, illustrating how anticipated suffering is often greater than actual suffering.
*   **The Monk and the Lion:** He recounts a parable of a monk hanging from a cliff, focusing on a beautiful flower and thinking "not yet" about his potential fall, as a model for maintaining peace amidst danger.
*   **The "Football" (Nuclear Briefcase):** This is dismissed as a "tactic of fear," noting that many presidents have had the power but nuclear war hasn't occurred.
*   **Doors and Chairs:** He suggests using everyday actions like opening a door or sitting down as mindfulness triggers to check in and choose to act happily.

**Conclusion:**
The talk is a direct application of the **Four Noble Truths**: Eric's suffering (*dukkha*) is caused by his craving and clinging to fearful narratives about the future. The cessation (*nirodha*) of that suffering is possible by letting go of those thoughts and abiding in the present. The path is the mindful practice of releasing unwholesome thoughts and choosing a peaceful mind.

The final message is: **"Don't worry, be happy. You're already okay."**

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several **metaphors and stories** to make his point about letting go of fear and living in the present. Here’s a breakdown:

### **Metaphors**
1.  **Wax in the ears:** He says the session is about "how to clean the politics and the other wax in your ears out." This metaphor compares political anxiety and fear-mongering to a physical blockage that distorts hearing and understanding. The "cleaning" is the practice of clearing the mind of these fear-based thoughts.
2.  **Hot potato:** Referring to a legacy of fear or political anxiety passed from father to son, he tells Eric, "he gave you the hot potato, and now you're the one that's suffering." This illustrates how emotional burdens (like fear or a certain worldview) can be passed on and cause present suffering.
3.  **Football (Nuclear Briefcase):** While Eric uses this literally, Dhammarato dismisses it as a "tactic of fear, not of war." He reframes the "football" as a symbol of abstract, fear-based thinking rather than an immediate physical threat.
4.  **Potload of fear:** He repeatedly says Eric has "bought a potload of it [fear]" from the media. This metaphor frames fear as a commodity that is sold (by media) and consumed (by individuals), leading to a heavy, burdensome accumulation.
5.  **Door and Chair as mindfulness triggers:** He suggests using everyday actions like going through a door or sitting in a chair as "an anchor, or a trigger" to check one's mental state. The metaphor is that these routine moments are *doorways* to choice—we can choose to act happily or unhappily.
6.  **Trump between your ears vs. the real Trump:** He makes a crucial distinction: "We're talking about the Donald Trump between your ears, the one you made up. Not the real one." This metaphor separates the **mental construct** (which causes suffering) from the **external reality** (which is unknown and not currently harming the listener).

### **Stories & Anecdotes**
1.  **The Principal's Paddling:** He shares a personal story from 5th grade about being terrified of a paddling from the principal. The actual paddling was less painful than the fear leading up to it. The moral is: **"I was more terrified of getting that paddling than the actual paddling itself."** This directly parallels the current political fear—the anticipation is worse than any realized event.
2.  **The Monk and the Lion (The "Not Yet" Story):** This is the central parable of the talk. A monk, chased by a lion, falls off a cliff but catches a branch. Facing certain death above (lion) and below (precipice), he focuses on a nearby flower and thinks, **"Everything is okay... not yet. I haven't fallen yet, the lion hasn't gotten me yet."** The story teaches the practice of **"not yet"**—dwelling in the present moment where danger hasn't materialized, thereby finding peace amid perceived crisis.
3.  **Schindler's List / Hiding from the Gestapo:** To argue that opposition will arise to extreme actions, he alludes to Holocaust history: "Have you ever heard of Schindler?... a whole bunch of [people] were hiding between the rafters." He uses this to suggest that fears of mass roundups will be met with widespread resistance, so one need not carry the fear personally.
4.  **The Hippies and the BMWs:** To counter Eric's lament about the lost "Age of Aquarius," he tells a story of societal natural progression: "All of those hippies of the 1970s are driving around in their BMWs on the way to vote for Donald Trump." This story illustrates his point that ideals change with age, and clinging to a hoped-for future leads to suffering.

### **Core Narrative Metaphor**
The entire talk is structured around a **master metaphor**: **Political fear is a self-created mental toxin that can be voluntarily cleansed.** The "Dhamma" is presented as the antidote—a practice of recognizing fearful thoughts (about Trump, nuclear war, etc.) as mere thoughts about an unknown future, and consciously returning to the safety and okay-ness of the present moment ("You're safe and warm right now").

The speaker uses these metaphors and stories to shift the discussion from external politics to internal mental management, emphasizing that suffering is "optional" and that peace is found by discarding the "dirty gift" of fear.
