### Transcript


**Speaker A:** So, uh, the recording is just about— there we go. All right, so this is your first private call with me, but you've been on the, uh, the Skype, I think it was in the UK, uh, not long ago. And though there's a J in your name, it's not pronounced. So it's the Losha?

**Speaker B:** Alyosha?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, okay. All right, okay. I'll remember it someday. So as we're beginning to talk, it looks like that you've had some Zen experience, and so we can put the Zen practice as examples of correct practice, as well as then in its rigid rigidity of where that is not advisable. And so we'll talk about that kind of thing. So the first thing that I wanted to mention was you probably at least heard of, if not ever seen, what is referred to as a Zen stick.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, have you ever seen one, a real one?

**Speaker B:** A real Zen state?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, a real Zen stick is a piece of bamboo.

**Speaker B:** Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, like the, the bent, uh, yeah, I've seen it. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Well, actually, it's got a slit down the middle of about a foot into it, and then it's carved out a little bit so that when that edge of the stick hits, it makes a clapping sound with the other side of the carved-out stick. And so it makes quite a loud sound without it having to get hit. So it's not something that a Zen master uses to torture a student. Just a little tap will do you, okay? And it makes a lot of noise, especially if it's right beside your ear. So the question would be, who is it that the Zen master hits with the Zen stick?

**Speaker B:** That sounds like a koan.

**Speaker A:** Yes. Okay, who is it that the Zen master hits with the Zen stick?

**Speaker B:** I'm at a loss.

**Speaker A:** All right. He hits the guy who does not know that the Zen master is there.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay. And so if the student is sitting and the Zen master walks up behind him, he'll notice it and his posture will shift ever so tiny and the Zen master will see that. And pass on by. But if he stands behind someone who does not make any movement at all, they're doing either one of two things: they're lost in thought or they're lost in absorption. Ah, yeah. And in either case, they're going to get hit to wake them up to come back to the here-now. That the just sitting is just sitting here now. It's not just sitting and going off into mental arithmetic or what you would call daydreaming, and also is not making the mind dull in the sense that we normally think of as absorption when meditation goes deep. But in fact, when I hear about the word deep in meditation, I remember one of the comedians, I think it was Eddie Murphy, who was talking about going deep under undercover. How deep undercover can he go? How deep can you go? And generally the answer to that would be you can at least go to rock bottom. But the question is, why would you want to hit rock bottom? Why cannot we be very alert and awake to our Dukkha so that we can wake up to those unwholesome thoughts very quickly rather than having to go chase them all the way to the bottom. Now, I think that that has partially to do with the translation error, because Zen itself doesn't have a lot of translations because it never got to translations in the first place, that there was very little of the Theravada literature that ever made it to Japan. And so what they originally had was only the correct practice. And that over time, that a lot of that correct practice has become more rigidified rather than staying a very natural practice. But some of the things like the Zen stick is reminiscent of the actual teachings. So I imagine that the new Zen master with the new Zen stick is hitting willy-nilly and he doesn't even know whom to hit because he wasn't trained properly in waking up. And still thinking that going deep or going into absorption, being really out of it, is the way to go. Now, basically, this word absorption is also used in the sense of concentration.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, that's what I was, I think, more referring to when I was using that word.

**Speaker A:** Okay. So this also is not what we're practicing. We're not practicing concentration. What we're doing instead is waking up the mind by adding factors and ingredients to it to make it more whole, rather than dividing and cutting it out and throwing out what you would think of as non-essentials. Now, there's another way of talking about concentration in the sense of look at what you're doing and focusing on what you're doing. But most of the people, when they hear concentrate on what you're doing, they think about going deep into some sort of concentration rather than just merely paying attention or staying focused on what we're doing.

**Speaker B:** And also narrowing, probably, right?

**Speaker A:** Like, and narrowing it down rather than widening it up. So what we're going to be doing from the beginning is working on widening things out rather than shutting them down. That in fact the Pali word Samadhi is translated as concentration wrongly, because the word Samadhi actually, as described in the sutras, is gathering the factors together. And the example that would be used would be a yurt, which has a center pole and then side ridge poles, and they all come together at the top. Give it strength. Another example of that would be a tripod, like a camera. There's a point up at the top of that tripod where all three legs go together and they're stable at that point. That's the Samadhi point for the tripod. Another example is an American Indian Native American teepee, which has the ridge poles and they're all tied up very close to the top. On one end, and then the legs are spread out around, and that gives it tremendous stability, is because it's tied off at that Samatha point. All right, so that's what we mean by Samatha. It means gathering the factors together. So the gathering of the factors together that we're going to get is listed, and that we should then work on gathering these various factors together, to not concentrate on one, but rather to develop them all as a unit. Or let us say that we build on one and then another, and then we use those two to help build the third. That's also the way to look at it. And all of this starts with the skills that we're developing through the Eightfold Noble Path, that in fact, when we're practicing the Eightfold Noble Path and putting those factors together, that's what makes Samadhi that you probably heard about in the Eightfold Noble Path is Samma Arya Samadhi, which means the mind is organized and unified because it doesn't have any pieces missing. And yet the Western mind thinks that that means that the mind is somehow concentrated. Rather than flexible. And so my joke is, imagine that you've got an old-style alarm clock with gears and a spring and all of that kind of stuff. And so you take it to the watchmaker, and he's going to take it apart and clean it and then fit it carefully back together and then tune it so that it's now in a state of Samadhi. It's clean and it functions correctly. But if you take it to somebody who's going to concentrate that clock, he's going to take a sledgehammer to it, and he's going to get it very small and tight, but it's not going to function very well. So what would you rather have? Would you rather have a Samadhi clock that's functioning correctly, or would you rather have a concentrated clock?

**Speaker B:** I see where you're going. In technical manner, then, would that mean that maybe you start at the breath at first, but you don't narrow down on the breath, but you then move into the body, into the environment, into the sound, and you kind of mesh it all together and like into one thing where you kind of try to perceive it all at the same time. Is that what you're saying?

**Speaker A:** Well, let us say that an opening is an opening, and that because it's open, it has the availability to deal with whatever is coming from whatever direction. But that does not mean that all things will be coming from all directions all the time. That's the distinction, is that we're looking at things one by one as they occur. Without getting to the point of looking at one of them when it occurs, and then when it stops and something else occurs, we're still trying to get it. All right. An example of that would be, you probably heard of the toy or the arcade machine of whack-a-mole, where you've got 16 holes and a little thing will come up. You're supposed to bat them down. And now one of the ways that you can learn to play the game is by just looking at one hole. And if one hole has a mole, you can whack that one. And if you get good at that, then you can begin to add others. But most people don't do it that way. They'll whack any mole that they can see come up. Right. And so that means that it comes almost in a random order, or at least in an order that is regulated somehow from something within the machine. But the point is, is that if we only look at one of the molds, we're going to miss 15 of them. And this is the problem with concentration, is that we're missing out on a whole lot of stuff that could be happening, including the Zen master walking up right behind us with his stick.

**Speaker B:** And what about like two molds coming up at the same time? Like, how would that map onto the meditation?

**Speaker A:** The lucky part is that we don't have to deal with them instantaneously. When you say the same time, what kind of clock are you using?

**Speaker B:** So in practical terms, again, let's say I notice something in the breath, and at the same time I feel like a warmth in my hands or a gladdening in my chest.

**Speaker A:** And I'm saying that no, that that's not possible. You'll notice one and then the other very quickly, and then the next very quick.

**Speaker B:** So it's, it's, it's actually switching. Mhm.

**Speaker A:** Exactly correct.

**Speaker B:** It's not a split— you wouldn't say it's a split focus. It just appears to be, uh, a split focus, and in reality, I— it.

**Speaker A:** Appears to be a split focus simply because you're not watching the splitting and the refocusing that you're doing.

**Speaker B:** I see. Mhm. Okay.

**Speaker A:** And one of the ways that you could play with that on the side is to pull something up, an audio, for instance, someone talking. It doesn't matter what about the Dhamma or the news or whatever, and then go get another PDF file or some thing to read and then listen to the voice and read at the same time. You can't. We go back and forth from one to the other, and sometimes you'll get stuck on one and forget the other. You can only do one thing at a time. The brain is kind of wired like that, but it's also pretty fast. And so we move from one thing back and forth. So students will say, oh, well, I have— I'm able to watch the breath, but I still have background thoughts. No, the thoughts are not in the background. When that thought is there, it's right there in the foreground, but it's only there occasionally. Most of the time it's out someplace while we're watching the breath, and then thought comes in, and then we come back to the breath, and then the thought comes in. So that's a much more important way of looking at it, is that things happen one by one and we're going to be paying attention to them one by one as they occur. That's the actual practice, is to start watching what's going on one by one as they occur.

**Speaker B:** So would you say that then with, let's say, a more experienced meditator, then the switches are happening less, or there's just less in the mind that comes up?

**Speaker A:** No, that the mind, the one of the skills that will be occurring is the skill of being able to catch things as fast as they're happening. In other words, our Sati begins to develop as a skill so that we can see things really quick.

**Speaker B:** So that's what you said about seeing the cops before they see you, the police. I really like that. Yeah.

**Speaker A:** To see it, to see, to see the Dukkha before it starts grinding in. That's the speed that we want to work with. And so, uh, let's just go back to the point about the Eightfold Noble Path, because that's the whole point of all of this. And that is, is that the Buddha says that when we get four of these factors together as a skill We incorporate those four things and their incorporation becomes the unification of the mind. And that this unification mind has both supports and features, and the features of the organized mind is that the mind is safe, secure, comfortable, relaxed, and it doesn't want anything. If it doesn't want anything, then it's unlikely to go kill someone to get it. Okay, so that means that a feature of an organized mind is high morality. But most people say, oh, you have to be moral and teach morality and whip everybody into line for morality, and only then can they become enlightened. Which is exactly opposite. No, let's get the mind organized and fit for duty, and then our morality is hunky-dory. And so that's one of the things that people have backwards with their concept of concentration versus Samadhi. So the first thing that we're going to work with is to getting all the factors together. Now we can look at those factors from the perspective of the mind itself, or we can look at it in the sense of the attributes they contribute to that. And so we're going to do both of those today, I hope.

**Speaker B:** So first, go ahead. Sorry to interject. So you would say if someone says, I'm concentrating on the breath to quiet the mind, that would be ill-advised because then you're missing pieces, correct?

**Speaker A:** Uh, I would say that that would be a very sloppy use of the word concentration.

**Speaker B:** Uh-huh. Okay.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Um, that the concentration that we're referring to generally will have the knitting of the brows, like somebody's actually working at concentrating. And this is exactly opposite of that. This is much more learning how to relax rather than how to concentrate or focus or hang on.

**Speaker B:** Okay, so it's too much effort there, right?

**Speaker A:** Exactly. So imagine that the school teacher is hauling the bad little primary kid to the office because he's misbehaved, and she's got him by the arm while he is struggling. He doesn't want to go, and he's resisting her. But she is hanging on to his arm, and that's the way that most people are concentrating. They're concentrating by hanging on to make sure that they don't let go. It would have been much easier for her to have had a conversation or a talk with this boy and getting him ready to go to the office if that was what the teacher thought was absolutely necessary. She could even talk the kid into going to the office so that he go on his own and she don't have to drag him there.

**Speaker B:** So all the parts are there.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, all right. Maybe even possible that she could solve the problem herself and don't have to take the kid to the office. But the way that she chose to do it was by control, by concentrating, by hanging on to him even when he is struggling to get away. This is how people practice concentration. And so let's look at it from a different perspective. Going back to the Eightfold Noble Path, we have four things to look at. The first one is Sati. But Sati for what? Sati is to remember to look, to remember to investigate, to remember to look at what we're doing. To remember to see the kind of thoughts that we have. So this is what we mean by right view. Noble right view, Samadhi, does not mean a viewpoint. It means viewing. It's investigating, not investigation. An investigation is a pile of paper that's been shoved into some cop's drawer. That's different than the actual investigating. OK, so that's what we have to look at, that this is not a worldview or an idea or a concept or a conclusion from prior investigation. But rather, Right Noble View is continuing to view without, let us say, taking the easy way out. Of just relying upon old concepts or conclusions, but rather to really look at what the mind is doing right here, right now. And when do we do that? Whenever we remember to do it. So that's Sati, and that Sati has various features to it. One is how often do we do it? Another one How strong is it? And the third one would be, how fast is it? So how often did we do it is a skill to be developed. This is why we practice Anapanasati, and then to remember to take a long deep breath, and to remember to take a long deep out breath. That doesn't mean that you're a failure when you don't remember to take a long deep breath, but it does have the quality that when you remember to take a long deep breath, take one. Take a long deep breath as you remember, and by doing that over and over again, it will help develop the skill of Sati, to remember. Also to look at what the mind is doing, to remember the breath and to remember the mind. And then we look at the breath, we look at the mind. By looking at the breath, we can see that this is a long breath, this is a long in-breath. We look at the breathing with the mind and see this is a long out-breath. Then we can begin to make that determination within the mind itself. Is this thought that we have, is this wholesome or not? So if the thought is not wholesome, then we have to take the right effort. So you could say that effort is twofold here. One is to put wholesome thoughts in the mind. You're already enlightened, don't struggle to get enlightened, you're already enlightened, right? That's the thought. And then the wholesome effort, the right effort, is to have those kind of wholesome thoughts in the mind as well as to remember and actually take the effort to take a long, deep breath, a long, deep, relaxing breath, as opposed to too much struggle. A lot of students say, oh, I've been doing Anapanasati and then I get tired. Well, that's because you're working too hard, and it's okay to quit when you're working too hard. Never mind, then later come back and start again.

**Speaker B:** That's what I asked you on the group call, right? When I said I was kind of, or getting bored with it, or being like, yeah, and then I kind of get to a point where I'm doing it for a while and then I'm like, this gets kind of tedious or boring. And then that would be the point where, where I do what exactly you would say then?

**Speaker A:** Well, recognize that boredom and tediousness and tiredness and tension have come in. Right, and that would be a hindrance. That would be an unwholesome thought. I am tired, I am bored. All right, so one of the things that you could do is you can throw that out. Says, aha, I see that kind of thought, and never mind, I'm just going to sit here and enjoy the moment anyway. Another one you could recognize is whatever you got tired and bored with— and in fact, boredom is also restlessness that when we are bored, we're wanting to go do something else. So let's look at that wanting to go do something else. Suppose you might want to go do that, doesn't matter. But if you say, well, I'm tired and I'm bored and I want to quit meditation right now, damn it, I'm going to go off and do what I want to do, that's going off with an unwholesome thought. So coming back to a wholesome thought and say, yeah, this is the time to go do something else, let me enjoy that too. And so, uh, the wholesome and the unwholesome is the way that we're going to be paying attention to what kind of thoughts it is. Because thoughts of boredom are an unwholesome thought. Thoughts of tiredness is an unwholesome thought. Thoughts of, wow, I could go do this too, and never mind that. That would be a much more wholesome thought.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I think it's usually— it's not that. Usually it's just a very abstract, like, like, how long am I sitting here again? Like, when's the bell going to go that I put in?

**Speaker A:** Ah, because you're wanting something already.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And so what we're actually here practicing though is being satisfied and not wanting anything. Because I mean, after all, you probably admit you're quite an expert at wanting things.

**Speaker B:** I do admit, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, if you're an expert at wanting things, then the point of practicing wanting the bell to ring in a meditation, what value is that?

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, that's like I said, that's usually what happens when I do seated meditation, when I there I'm a little more agitated for some reason. And when I'm actually lying down, that point usually does not come.

**Speaker A:** Let's go into that 'for some reason' and look at that for a moment. Yeah, because boredom is actually a restlessness, which means a dissatisfaction with what's in the moment. And that dissatisfaction almost always has to do with some fear underlying or disappointment. And perhaps disappointment and fear are very closely related here. And so we can look at those feelings also, because the practice that we're practicing here is to gather up a new set of factors using the Eightfold Noble Path. And we've already talked about Right Sati, Right View, or Right Investigation, and Right Effort. Okay, so what we're going to take the effort at is to gladden the mind and brighten the mind. By doing so, we're throwing out the hindrances. By doing so, we're also applying the mind to the wholesome and then continuing with the wholesome. We're actually practicing something that's easy. It's really funny that students get tired and bored when they're actually— the instruction is to practice something that's easy. And not tiring at all to do. It's quite joyful. So we're already doing something wrong by the time that we've gotten bored with it. All right, we're working too hard. It would have been just enough effort to brighten the mind, to gladden the mind, and say, oh, I can handle this, everything's okay. All right, so by having wholesome thoughts like no place to go and nothing to do and everything is all right, and let me just sit here and relax. Those are the kind of thoughts that we apply and sustain them over and over again, especially for using language like, I feel safe, I feel secure, I feel calm, I feel comfortable. Then by having those kind of thoughts, we actually begin to feel safe and secure. And comfortable. And as we begin to feel safe and secure and comfortable, we're adding new Jhana factors. The Jhana factor now of satisfaction, which actually is exactly the opposite of the word dukkha, being dissatisfied. So we're actually practicing coming into a state of satisfaction over and over again, a little bit of satisfaction. Most students say, yeah, I've got satisfaction, just not enough. Oh, wait a minute, that's being dissatisfied with dissatisfaction. All right, let's be satisfied with the satisfaction that we do have. Let's talk ourselves into this is actually okay. And so this is the way we begin to practice over and over again to build up that feeling of safety, security, comfort, satisfaction. And then something new begins to build up on its own, and that is what is called confidence that you can in fact— because right now you're a bit confused. I'm not sure whether I can get myself into a state of satisfaction or not. But after you practice that, after you keep practicing it, you'll get the, uh, you'll get the point that, yeah, I can do this, I can come to a state of satisfaction.

**Speaker B:** I feel like I— it's interesting, like I said, with especially with the lying down meditation, I feel there's a point where after 20 or 30 minutes I usually enter into like this satisfactory state, and then I stay in for a while, and then at some point I just drop out of it and then don't kind of get back into it.

**Speaker A:** So everything arises and passes away. That there is no reason for me or you to fuss at yourself because you got it and then you lost it. But you will. You'll probably— you'll start pining over, oh, I had it, now I don't have it, oh, poor me. And that's just more being dissatisfied rather than saying, oh, I was satisfied. If I could be satisfied once, I could be satisfied again.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah. I mean, that's certainly what's, uh, been driving my increased interest that I found, or I think that was like a switch that kind of turned where before I was a little bit not so regular with the meditation. When I once found that I can get to that point regularly if I just do the practice, that got me to invest more, more time into it and get more interested in it. But then again, like you said, once you kind of get like the taste of it, you're like, ah, now I want it. And then once there's a little change in there, then you're like, oh, what happened now?

**Speaker A:** Well, a lot of students say things like you did, like it takes a long time, maybe 30, 40 minutes, and then I have it for a little while and then I lose it. Okay, that's the way that we have when we're sitting long periods of time. I would recommend that you sit shorter periods of time, say 20 minutes at the most, because certainly you can make yourself feel really good within 20 minutes. You should be able to do it. In fact, a better recommendation would be to do it for 15 minutes, 4 or 5 times a day.

**Speaker B:** Okay, I see. So not go the other way, 10.

**Speaker A:** Minutes, then go down to 10 minutes, 6, 7, 8 times a day. So having shorter periods of time to sit and getting better, quicker results out of it, that would be real progress.

**Speaker B:** Interesting. So you would say that going for longer at a time, that would actually be not so beneficial at the moment for me?

**Speaker A:** Actually, the reason that I say that is because, number one, the human attention span is well measured, well known, and sitting long periods of time is beyond a person's attention span. They're naturally going to get tired.

**Speaker B:** Yep.

**Speaker A:** If you're physically tired and yet continuing to work, you're not doing your body any good.

**Speaker B:** You're making it hard for yourself.

**Speaker A:** You're making it hard for yourself. That's what long sitting practice times do for students. It makes it more difficult for them to get any results at all. So sitting for an hour, sitting for 45 minutes is like the thing to do. Where in fact has way too much time because the, uh, the mind needs to get in there, get something done, and then move on.

**Speaker B:** Okay.

**Speaker A:** To go in, get yourself in a really good mood, and then go off someplace in that good mood. And then later in the day you come back, get yourself into a really good mood, and then go off in that good mood. This is a much better place to practice than sitting down and getting yourself all balled up and wound up and sitting for a long time wanting the bell to ring. And it's actually counterproductive in a way.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, so, but when, uh, I, I see, I see that. So when you're making it too hard for yourself, then like you said, the practice won't be productive. But if you feel like you get to that point that you were describing with the wholesome thoughts and you're staying in there for longer without that feeling of effort coming in, that would be then that would be okay, like, right?

**Speaker A:** But then what happens is it's going to be over anyway.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so are you going to push it yourself and say, wait a minute, I haven't put a whole hour yet, I've got to go do more and more and more, I got to go back and get it, or I'm tired now? That in fact is almost always better to leave it at a high note.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, okay, that's, that's a good info. Yeah, that's interesting. Yeah, so because if you're leaving it on a high note, it means you're practicing the thing that you want to practice instead of practicing being unsatisfied because you're, you're kind of pushing it, you're stretching your motivation or your concentration too far, right? Yeah, yeah, I like that. That's, that, that resonates certainly, right?

**Speaker A:** Uh, I'm glad that you understood that, uh, leaving on a high note. There's another expression that's used with comedians stand-up comics. Yeah, leave them laughing.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I mean, it certainly makes sense. Like, I work as— I teach movement, it's kind of my job. And if you have someone, you teach them a new movement, you want them to perform it relatively well most of the time, because if it's too hard for them or too tiring and they only get it like half of the time right, they're basically practicing not getting it right. So you want to keep the— I mean, it doesn't have to be perfect, obviously, but you want to have the quality to be relatively high so that you're actually practicing what you set out to do.

**Speaker A:** Essentially. So, okay, so you can use that example for the mind. So this long sitting time with actually, in many cases, it's competition. How long can you sit? Oh, I can sit 2 hours. That's it.

**Speaker B:** How long can you sit, Dhammarato?

**Speaker A:** There has been times when doing a retreat with students that the schedule would be a 45-minute sit and then a 15-minute break and then another 45-minute sit, and I would sit right through the whole thing just to encourage the students. But I don't teach that way anymore. In fact, I don't do retreats. I don't even think that they're of that much value anymore because it gets the students jealous and sets goals that they can't match.

**Speaker B:** It's interesting that you say that because I, like, 10 years ago or a little longer, I was very happy with like— like, that's when I first got into meditation and it was very much a part of my everyday life, and I was very interested, and it was really working well for me. I can really remember like being on my bicycle outside on a summer day and like feeling like meditating, just waiting at a set of lights and looking at things and being very in the moment. And I got very interested in it, and then I did a retreat, a Goenka retreat. And after that, I was like, okay, now 1 hour in the morning, 1 hour in the evening, and it really, like, it was too much. The retreat itself probably was already too much, but afterwards I was, yeah, way too ambitious. And while I probably still got a few good sessions in, a lot of them were, yeah, not so joyous. And yeah, I was doing more than I was probably— that was good for them and was good for me. And that kind of got me disillusioned from meditation for a long time, actually. So I can see that the Goenka.

**Speaker A:** Method will in fact put a student in the position of greed, of wanting, of wanting attainments, of wanting this, that, and the other. Okay. And the practice should be of coming into a state of satisfaction of whatever we've got is good enough. That in fact, wanting Jhana is a good reason to not ever have it. That in fact, wanting things that we don't have, like meditative states or whatever, is the classical definition of Dukkha itself. I think things that we do not have. And so what we need to do is change that style from wanting things that we don't have into, never mind, I don't need that, what I do have is good enough. And now we're changing it from an attitude of want or Dukkha into a state of satisfaction and Sukkha. So we actually are making a change for the positive intentionally and then taking the benefits of it. To where most of the ways that people are doing meditation because they're wanting something and they're trying to get it, they don't get it. And so they feel disappointed because they're missing this one point, and that is to gladden the mind or to make those unwholesome thoughts— I want it, I want it, I want it— into I don't need it, I'm okay without it, I'm just fine now. And so we continue to make the mind more wholesome over and over and over again. Until we build up confidence. The Pali word is Saddha, or Srotapanna in Sanskrit, and this is almost always translated into the word faith in English. This is not faith. Faith is almost reserved by the Christians to mean you've got to believe something and take it on faith without actually any evidence at all.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, what we're going to be practicing is something that's going to build confidence because we've got good solid evidence. And what is that good solid evidence? That I feel better when I allow myself to have wholesome thoughts. And when I have wholesome thoughts, I feel better. So that confidence begins to grow into I can feel better. I can feel the way that I want to feel. If I can feel the way I want to feel some of the time, then I can improve to where I can feel the way that I want to feel almost any time. There's actually in a sutta, the Buddha states it this way, that no matter how obstructed the mind gets, the student knows that he can clean those obstructions out and come back to reality and see the way that things really are. This is actually in the sutta. And then the next part of that paragraph is, is that this knowledge that I can come out of my hindrances no matter what's going on, no matter how bad I feel, no matter what situation I've got myself into, if I remember, I can come right out of that. I can take a deep breath put something else in my mind and get out of that. And then the Buddha says, this is noble. This is a noble way of looking at it. This is a factor of the path. So one is actually on the path of the Buddha. That statement right there is the whole quality of noble and on the path. It also has the quality that this is not held by ordinary people. That this change actually is a change in your own mentality, that you're no longer seeing things from an ordinary position of being a loser or being a victim or being challenged, or your winner's position, into being noble. I can do this, I can handle it no matter what. That's the way that we get started. That is actually the Samma Sanghappa this part of the Eightfold Noble Path. So we bring these four factors together: right view, right remembering, or right Sati, right effort, and then right attitude. The attitude of a winner, the attitude we've got this wired, the attitude of I can handle anything, the attitude the Buddha was called this, he was called a lion. This is that lion's attitude. Have the attitude, I can do anything. That's an attitude. Okay. And that attitude is the winner's attitude. And that attitude also is very wrapped up with the Pali word of Piti. So Piti and Sukkha are now in combination, as well as the fact that we're applying the mind and sustaining the mind on the wholesome. And keeping the wholesome out, and with the feeling good thoughts and the feeling of championship, and taking the effort to keep coming back to that state over and over and over again. This is what is called First Jhana. And it is Samadhi. Because it has the Jhana factors together. Then in fact there's 5 Jhana factors, but I'll add a 6th one because it's actually implied in the Anapanasati Sutta as well as actually pointed out in others, and that is that the body relaxes. So in the Goenka method, the whole idea of body scanning is to find the tensions and relax them. But for some reason, Goenka doesn't say to go through the body He calls about waking it up, but he doesn't say go find the tensions and relax them. That if your neck is tense, roll it around a bit and get it all loosey-goosey, get it all relaxed. Find out where the tensions are in the body and relax those, because that's also something wholesome. Just like we're finding all the tensions in the mind and relaxing that, we're finding all the tensions in the body and relaxing that. And in the process, we're finding all the restlessness and all the tensions in the feelings, the fear, the anxieties, and we begin to relax that too. And as we relax that, we know we can relax it. And so that gives us that feeling of I can do this again. And so we begin to feel safe and secure and comfortable and relaxed and satisfied and successful. This is the state then the Buddha talks— or actually, as Bhikkhu Buddhadasa talks about— this is the state where the mind is fit for work, where the mind is free from all of the hindrances and all the crap, that we feel up for the task, that we feel ready to go. We don't have any hindrances.

**Speaker B:** What's the— like, once you get to what you've just described like, let's say, first Jhana, what's the work then? What do you recommend once the body is kind of glad and the mind is kind of glad and you're feeling comfortable?

**Speaker A:** Sustaining that rather than letting it go, rather than letting the boredom come in. Oh, I'm bored now. I've had about as much of joy as I can stand right now. I'm off to mystery town now, guys. See you later. Okay. That's the whole point is being able to get into that state and then learning to sustain it. Sustain it with the next breath. And so in your regard, you can go into this state within the first minute. Your job then is to sustain it for 9 minutes.

**Speaker B:** Okay, yeah, interesting. So coming back to the ending on a high note, though, like, how do you know when the high note is then? Because for me, the way it sometimes goes is like I am in, in that state, and I feel like I, I have arrived, or that's, it's working well. But then the drop can be quite quick, like, and it can be— then it's not the high note anymore.

**Speaker A:** That's why we need to learn to sustain this. What happened that you, that lost it? What was it that happened in the mind? What was it that you were doing that you didn't see that you were doing? You missed it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I see. So looking inside, that would be a.

**Speaker A:** Moment of what happened here.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Why do I not like this anymore?

**Speaker B:** And would you say that is something that you would call insight, learning what that is?

**Speaker A:** Actually, I would reserve the word insight for Dukkha, insight into the nature of Dukkha. Because if you can recognize Dukkha very quickly, then you can avoid it very easily.

**Speaker B:** But most likely it was Dukkha that led to that drop, right?

**Speaker A:** Right. An unwholesome thought.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** Okay, so start watching what it is that's going to pull you out of a good state. So the next time when you come back to meditation, you can come back and recognize that another time so that it doesn't pull you out. And you can say, hey, now I can end my meditation on the high note because I know what the low note is that I played before last time. Now I'm going to play a high note in me.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, I asked you this on, I think, Sunday as well. This is really interesting to me because I notice it in a lot of fields that, you know, once you, you kind of get more into something, then you notice that a lot of people are straining way too hard. Like for me, like with the movement training stuff, like sometimes people come to me and they think they have to do all this training and they have to work really hard all the time. It has to be really uncomfortable for them to achieve anything. And then oftentimes my job— like first.

**Speaker A:** Grade, yes, everybody does what they do the way that they did first grade. If first week was hard for you, then everything is hard for you.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, and it's really weird for them then to say that when I tell them like, yeah, it's like, do it in a way that you can sustain it, that there's still like something left in the tank. You can do it again the next day and the next day and the next day, so it's sustainable. And I find it really interesting that, you know, and like you said also in meditation, that it's such a widespread belief that it has to be hard. Like, if I tell people that I spend half an hour in like, uh, in a Jhana state— like, I don't tell them that I'm in a Jhana state, but I, I'm like, I want to do it this long because it's comfortable. And people are like, um, are you doing it wrong then? Like, if it's comfortable, shouldn't it be like hard? It's, it's so interesting that, uh, it's so backwards on this topic.

**Speaker A:** Exactly. Let us say that it can possibly come from the belief that if you cannot do it, and you cannot do it easily, then you can at least put on the effort of struggle.

**Speaker B:** I see. Okay, that's interesting.

**Speaker A:** Okay, because if I struggle in front of God and still fail, then God's mercy.

**Speaker B:** Yes, yes, yes. So you're putting— at least you're putting on the struggle show to show everyone that you're doing something. You might not be doing the actual thing, but at least you're showing effort.

**Speaker A:** That's the— right, you're showing effort so that you can get forgiven for failing.

**Speaker B:** Ah, it's such a— that's a sad display.

**Speaker A:** But yeah, right. If somebody keeps struggling like that, they'll eventually start winning. But the whole point is that they could have been winning all along by playing with it rather than struggling with it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah.

**Speaker A:** And probably there's some value in struggle, but there is a whole lot more value in learning how to do it without struggling with it.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. That resonates a lot with me. So thanks for that point. I think that's That's helpful. And something that I've learned in other areas, but oftentimes when you get into something new, you— or you kind of intensify your efforts on in something, you're like, yeah, sure, like, I— it should feel harder, it should be struggle, uh.

**Speaker A:** Instead of— well, if it's valuable, it's got to be worth something. If it's worth something, it should cost something. And that is the struggle.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's interesting because I think a lot of people, they are embarrassed to take the easy way. And while the easy way— hopes to—.

**Speaker A:** Our society does not support that. Look at the language that's built right in. Let me give you a few words: job, work, labor. Try hard, difficult. You hear that language? That's the language that we use for our everyday lives, and especially for our employment. Why does employment have to be hard labor work when we can— are, you know, we can make money and have fun? A lot of people say, go find something that you like to do instead of working at a job you don't like to do. The Buddha's got a different perspective of that, and that is, whatever you're doing, like that. And if you can't like it, then question why you're doing it. Why do things that you don't like to do? Why don't you do things that you can do and you do like to do? And everything that you are doing, you're already doing, so why not like that anyway? So that's the whole point. Well, we're not supposed to like what we're doing. We're supposed to work at it. We're supposed to labor. We're supposed to show the boss that even though we're not as productive as other people, we're working as hard as we can. Okay, so often that hard work has to do with avoiding punishment.

**Speaker B:** And so what's the punishment in meditation that people are fearing, you think? Like the disapproval of like not getting enlightened?

**Speaker A:** Right, which is something that they want because they feel that they're in a state of deprivation. But if you feel like you've already got everything that you want and need, then you don't need enlightenment. You're satisfied with the way things are. So this is part of the change of attitude that we have. That's a major point, is let's come out of being a victim into being a winner, that we've got this. I can handle this.

**Speaker B:** So the perceived experience is like, yeah, I can handle this, instead of, oh, this is hard, and 10 more minutes, and I'll have to kind of work through this, and like that type of stuff. And instead of being like, this is nice, this feels good.

**Speaker A:** If you'll notice, here's something that's very interesting that way, and that is that it is those people who think meditation is hard are going to make sure that other people think that it's hard too, because then they'll agree with them. And so they have them sit for an hour, and nobody can sit for an hour, not Westerners. And in fact, here in Thailand, people sit in all kinds of postures on the floor, including— I've got a stepdaughter who, since I've known her since she was 11 years old, she's actually getting close to graduating from university now. And every meal she eats, she eats in the full lotus posture, but she's not the only one. Now I bet you can't even get into the full lotus posture.

**Speaker B:** Oh, actually, I'm actually quite— I can do the splits and stuff like that. I actually can, but still, like, it's not something that I do every day.

**Speaker A:** So, and the question again is that I'm getting to is the so what? Because in fact, if you can do the full lotus posture, then other people will be jealous of you wanting to get into the lotus posture because they think that it's some sort of special meditation posture.

**Speaker B:** I mean, I like— right now I like lying down meditation better anyway, so— but yeah.

**Speaker A:** So let's go ahead and finish up now. Let's get a little bit of review about that. This is really all about the Buddha's Eightfold Noble Path. Everything that we teach comes into his main teaching of Dukkha, Dukkha, Nirodha— finding that Dukkha, insight into what is Dukkha, and coming out of it immediately. That's the real practice. That's why we want to wake up to remember, so that we can look to see what is Dukkha and what is not Dukkha, right here, right now, in front of us, in our mind, and then make a change. Right effort. To change it from an unwholesome thought into a wholesome thought. And as we do that over and over again, we begin to get the attitude of, hey, I can do this anytime I want to. This is also the process of developing the first Jhana, which gets the mind really fit for work. Free from hindrances, applying the mind to the wholesome, sustaining it for the wholesome. And then next time when we talk, we'll talk about Well, what do we do with the mind that's wholesome? Because that's something that is missed out on. What do we do once we get the mind wholesome?

**Speaker B:** I'm curious about that, to hear that.

**Speaker A:** All right, well, let's finish now. And I'm really glad that you called, and I'd recommend that you call once or twice a week, something like that, and we'll continue.

**Speaker B:** Thank you very much, Dhammarato. That was very helpful.

**Speaker A:** But you see.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk between Dhammarato (Speaker A) and a student named Alyosha (Speaker B) focuses on correcting common misunderstandings about meditation practice, particularly around concentration and effort. Here is a summary of the key points:

### **Core Theme: Samadhi vs. Concentration**
Dhammarato argues that the Pali word *samadhi* is mistranslated as "concentration." True *samadhi* is not a narrow, forceful focusing but a **unification and organization of the mind**—like gathering all the parts of a well-functioning clock, not smashing it into a small, tight ball. The goal is a flexible, alert, and open awareness, not a dull, absorbed state.

### **Key Analogies and Illustrations**
1.  **The Zen Stick:** Used not to punish, but to wake up a student who is "lost"—either in thought or in dull absorption—and bring them back to the "here-now."
2.  **Whack-a-Mole:** The mind can only attend to one thing at a time, switching rapidly. Meditation isn't about blocking things out but skillfully noticing each "mole" (sensation, thought) as it arises.
3.  **Dragging a Student:** Forceful concentration is like a teacher dragging a struggling child; skillful practice is like talking the child into walking willingly. One is a struggle, the other is cooperative and easy.

### **Practical Meditation Instructions**
*   **Purpose:** To **gladden and brighten the mind**, not to strain or "go deep." The aim is to cultivate wholesome thoughts (e.g., "I am safe, satisfied, have nowhere to go") that lead to feelings of safety, security, comfort, and satisfaction (*sukkha*).
*   **Method:** Use the **Eightfold Path** framework, specifically:
    *   **Right View (Investigation):** Continuously looking at what the mind is doing.
    *   **Right Mindfulness (Sati):** Remembering to observe the breath and the mind.
    *   **Right Effort:** Gently replacing unwholesome thoughts (boredom, wanting) with wholesome ones.
    *   **Right Attitude (Samma Sankappa):** Cultivating a "lion's" or "winner's" attitude: "I can handle this. I can find satisfaction."
*   **Duration:** **Shorter, more frequent sessions** (e.g., 10-20 minutes, several times a day) are advised over long, arduous sits. This prevents fatigue and allows you to consistently "end on a high note," reinforcing the positive state.
*   **Posture:** Comfort is key. Lying down is fine. The cultural fetish for difficult postures like full lotus is irrelevant to the real work.

### **Critique of Common Misconceptions**
*   **"Hard is Good":** The widespread belief that meditation must be difficult or a struggle is counterproductive. This often stems from a cultural idea that valuable things must cost effort, or from a desire to "show effort" even if failing.
*   **Goenka & Long Retreats:** Dhammarato suggests intensive retreats and methods like Goenka's can foster **greed for attainments** and unrealistic goals, leading to disappointment. They emphasize wanting what you don't have, which is the definition of *dukkha* (suffering/discontent).
*   **Jhana as a Byproduct:** **First Jhana** is described not as a trance but as the natural result of this practice: a mind unified by wholesome factors, free from hindrances, feeling glad, confident, and "fit for work." **Wanting Jhana prevents it.**

### **The Ultimate Goal**
The practice is about **insight into *dukkha***. By learning to quickly recognize the unwholesome thoughts that cause discontent (like boredom or wanting), you can swiftly replace them and sustain a satisfied mind. This builds **confidence** (*saddhā*), not blind faith, based on the direct evidence that wholesome thoughts lead to well-being.

The talk concludes with a teaser for the next conversation: **What do you do with a mind that is wholesome and fit for work?**

**In essence:** Dhammarato advocates for a gentle, joyful, and alert meditation practice that unifies the mind through wholesome intentions, rejecting rigid, effortful concentration in favor of relaxed, open awareness that ends suffering by cultivating immediate satisfaction.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker (Dhammarato) uses several vivid metaphors and stories to illustrate key points about meditation practice, the pitfalls of common approaches, and the correct understanding of Buddhist concepts. Here are the main ones:

### **Metaphors and Stories:**

1.  **The Zen Stick (Kyōsaku):**
    *   **Story:** The talk opens with a description of the Zen stick (a split bamboo stick used in some traditions). The teacher explains its true purpose: not for punishment, but to tap a student who is "lost in thought or lost in absorption" and unaware of the present moment.
    *   **Metaphorical Meaning:** Represents the need for **alertness and presence** in meditation ("just sitting here now"). It criticizes practices that aim for dullness or deep trance states, instead emphasizing waking up to the "here-now."

2.  **Eddie Murphy's "Deep Undercover":**
    *   **Story:** References a comedy bit by Eddie Murphy about going "deep undercover." The speaker asks, "How deep can you go?... you can at least go to rock bottom. But the question is, why would you want to hit rock bottom?"
    *   **Metaphorical Meaning:** Critiques the common goal of seeking "deep" states of concentration or absorption. The point is not to chase thoughts or dullness to the bottom, but to be **alert enough to catch suffering (Dukkha) early** and wake up from it quickly.

3.  **Samadhi as a Well-Assembled Structure (vs. a Smashed Clock):**
    *   **Metaphor 1 (Positive):** Samadhi (often mistranslated as "concentration") is likened to a **yurt, a tripod, or a teepee**—structures where all the parts (poles) come together at a central point, creating stability and unity.
    *   **Metaphor 2 (Negative):** "Concentration" in the common, forceful sense is likened to taking a **sledgehammer to an alarm clock**. You make it "very small and tight" (concentrated), but it no longer functions. True Samadhi is like a **clock cleaned and tuned by a watchmaker**—all parts integrated and functioning correctly.
    *   **Core Meaning:** True meditation is about **gathering and unifying the factors of a healthy mind** (like the Eightfold Path), not about narrow, forceful focusing that excludes parts of experience.

4.  **Whack-a-Mole:**
    *   **Metaphor:** Meditation is compared to the arcade game. If you only stare at one hole (e.g., the breath), you'll miss all the other "moles" (sensations, thoughts, sounds). The skillful player watches the whole field and responds to what arises.
    *   **Meaning:** Advocates for an **open, flexible awareness** that can notice phenomena as they arise in the present moment, rather than an exclusive, narrow focus that misses most of experience (including the "Zen master with his stick").

5.  **The Teacher Dragging the Struggling Child:**
    *   **Story:** A teacher forcibly drags a misbehaving child to the office while the child resists.
    *   **Metaphorical Meaning:** Represents the **counterproductive effort and struggle** in "concentration" meditation. The meditator is "hanging on" to an object (like the breath) with tense effort. The alternative is to "talk" the mind into cooperation—using understanding and gladdening thoughts to bring it to a wholesome state willingly.

6.  **Leaving on a High Note / Leave Them Laughing:**
    *   **Metaphor:** Borrowed from comedy and performance. The advice is to **end meditation sessions while still in a good, wholesome state**, rather than pushing until you become tired, bored, or frustrated.
    *   **Meaning:** Encourages **shorter, more frequent sessions** where you practice success and satisfaction. This builds positive reinforcement and confidence, rather than practicing struggle and dissatisfaction in long, arduous sits.

7.  **The Lion's Attitude:**
    *   **Metaphor:** The confident, wholesome attitude developed through practice is called the **"lion's attitude."**
    *   **Meaning:** It signifies a shift from feeling like a victim or a loser to a **noble, confident mindset**: "I can handle this. I can come out of unwholesome states no matter what." This confidence (*Saddhā*) is based on experiential evidence, not blind faith.

8.  **First-Grade Mindset & Societal "Hard Work" Programming:**
    *   **Metaphor/Story:** The speaker suggests people approach everything with the mindset they formed in first grade. If learning was a struggle then, they approach all new skills (including meditation) as a struggle.
    *   **Extended Critique:** Connects this to societal language that values "job, work, labor, try hard, difficult." People often think valuable things must be hard and involve struggle, leading them to **perform effort** (like showing the boss they're working hard) rather than doing the task effectively and joyfully.
    *   **Meaning:** Meditation doesn't have to be a struggle. The belief that it must be hard is a cultural conditioning to be overcome. The path is about learning to **like and be satisfied with the present moment**, not about laboring toward a future goal.

### **Summary of Core Themes Illustrated by These Metaphors:**
*   **Alertness over Absorption:** Be awake and present, not dull or trance-like (Zen Stick, Whack-a-Mole).
*   **Unification over Concentration:** Integrate the mind's factors, don't narrow it down forcefully (Yurt/Tripod vs. Sledgehammered Clock).
*   **Skillful Effort over Struggle:** Gladden and relax the mind into cooperation, don't force it (Teacher & Child, High Note).
*   **Confidence over Faith:** Build proven confidence from direct experience, not blind belief (Lion's Attitude).
*   **Satisfaction over Striving:** Cultivate contentment in the present, not greedy striving for future states (Leaving on a High Note, Critique of "Hard Work").

These metaphors effectively contrast a rigid, goal-oriented, and effortful approach to meditation with a more flexible, present-centered, and joyful practice based on the Eightfold Path.
