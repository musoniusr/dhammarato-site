### Transcript


**Speaker A:** Sorry, you cut out. I didn't hear you.

**Speaker B:** Do you see me?

**Speaker A:** Yeah, yeah, I just— you just cut out for a second.

**Speaker B:** All right, comes back on now. Okay, so you've just been practicing for a short time and now you're telling me you're getting good benefit from it. This is a good sign. Smiling and smiling.

**Speaker A:** But that was like during a longer sit. It wasn't during one of the 10-minute sits.

**Speaker B:** Okay, well, if you need to take longer, but basically if you in that 10 minutes, if you keep repeating wholesome thoughts over and over again, then you'll get good results. But generally you'll have a— you'll remember to have a wholesome thought, you'll have a wholesome thought, then the mind wanders away, and it can wander away for 9 minutes. Yeah, it could wander away for a long time. And so the skill to develop is to remember to keep coming back and looking at what you're thinking about, and then make it a change to the wholesome. And that has to be repeated over and over and over again, and then you can get benefit in 10 minutes or so. So if it takes longer than that, what that means is that in that 10 minutes you've got a lot of unwholesome thoughts mixed in with it.

**Speaker A:** Yeah, sure.

**Speaker B:** And then maybe after 20 minutes, the that the mind will settle down, and then you can start having more wholesome thoughts. But there's no reason to wait for the mind to settle down. You can actually settle it down.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** And with having thoughts about settling the mind— wow, I can be peaceful and calm so that the mind does not jump around. You can start telling yourself that kind of stuff so that you can get great benefit.

**Speaker A:** Okay, I just— can I clarify the distinction between wholesome and unwholesome thoughts? I guess.

**Speaker B:** Or— okay, right. Let's put wholesome and unwholesome thoughts into 3 groups. The downright unwholesome are easy enough to understand. The downright wholesome are easy enough to understand, and that gets about 10%. And what about the other 90% is unknown for the beginner. And as your skill develops, you'll get better discernment. As to finding out what kind of thoughts are wholesome and unwholesome, so that the scale begins to shift, so that a lot of the thoughts you thought were okay now wind up being unwholesome. And why do we call it now unwholesome? We can also use the word hindrance. And we can call them hindrances because they hinder you from feeling really good. So ordinary thoughts about today, ordinary thoughts about whatever, generally are hindering thoughts because they're hindering you from having that giant smile, that great joy. Okay, so let's look at some thoughts that we know for sure are for sure downright unwholesome. Thoughts of revenge, thoughts of getting even, thoughts of guilt. And that a very clear example of that for me today is that last night our puppy died.

**Speaker A:** Oh, I'm so sorry.

**Speaker B:** And well, you— that's the whole point right there, that 'oh, I'm so sorry' is an unwholesome thought. Oh, she was sick and we took her to the vet, and the vet said, 'Bring her,' gave her medicine, a shot, and then told her to come back tomorrow. But she acted— the vet also says if she's a strong dog, she'll still be alive tomorrow. And she didn't make it. All right, so, um, naturally the feeling of guilt will come in. Oh, what could I have done differently to have saved the dog, right? The answer was, is that it was not in my control. And so the best way then to handle it is to have happy thoughts about the puppy and wish her farewell, goodbye, and let that be that. She's not here today, and that's okay. Now, we are taught completely differently in our society, that in fact you responded with, "Oh, I'm so sorry," from the position of how you were taught in society to respond, that you're supposed to feel bad when a puppy dies. And in fact, what that also does is when death happens, it reminds us of death, and it reminds us that all creatures are temporary. We're all going to die. That can be an unwholesome thought, or it can be a wholesome thought. When we recognize, yes, all creatures die, let's have the best right now that we can have, because we're not going to have as many of them as we want. So let's start enjoying the present moment. Okay, so this is kind of how we can begin to understand unwholesome thoughts. But thoughts of revenge, thoughts of cruelty, thoughts like in this case, thoughts of guilt, thoughts of sorrow, thoughts about loss, that's going to prevent you from being in a really good state. Now, your state of sorrow is not going to help that puppy. My temporary thoughts of guilt are not going to help the puppy. But if we would ask the puppy after she's dead, how would you want us to handle it? Do you want us to be sad and remorseful and guilty, or do we want— or does the puppy want us to be happy and joyful? Because she was a happy, joyful, playful puppy up until 2 days ago, and then she got a stomach bacterial infection. Okay, so that's the point then, is that you have a choice about how you feel, but we don't exercise that choice because we're not looking at how we think, we're not looking at how we feel, and we assume that they're okay. So I'll use this as an example of guilt. And sorrow. But other unwholesome thoughts that are really downright unwholesome thoughts were thoughts about revenge, like, well, why didn't that vet do better? I'm going to report that vet because she didn't keep my dog alive. She sent it home when she should have put it in the animal hospital. You hear those kind of thoughts? Okay, those thoughts of revenge are for sure unwholesome. And you can apply that example then to other things. An example would be how a bully treats you, and if you want to take revenge on that bully, then That's unwholesome. That you can forget all about the bully and say, I'm going to handle him with a big smile. He can't touch me. Okay, so we can in fact change our unwholesome thoughts, our hindering thoughts, if we can remember to check that out. And then make a change.

**Speaker A:** Right.

**Speaker B:** And we have to keep remembering and remembering and remembering to do that, because we have built up quite a habit. You in fact have been taught over and over again by your culture, by your family, by your teachers, by your aunts, uncles, cousins, classmates, Anicca, mates, all kinds of people have spent most of their time in unwholesome thoughts. So we have to practice coming out of our unwholesome thoughts into wholesome thoughts. So that's one kind of thought that we can say is downright unwholesome. Thoughts of sadness, thoughts of guilt, thoughts of revenge, thoughts of anger, thoughts of remorse, thoughts of being in a hurry. Oh, I've got to get that done. Oh, what's the problem here? So when you can start to remember to look at those kind of thoughts, then you'll see that they're unwholesome. And then we can change it to the other kind. And the other kind of thoughts would be then wholesome thoughts, which would be, "Oh, the puppy is better off now. We're all right, we're okay. Let us enjoy, let us celebrate the life of the puppy. Let us have a good smile." When we tell people about the puppy, let's always remind them that they can in fact gain joy from that rather than wallowing in sorrow and loss. So those are wholesome thoughts, the kind of thoughts that will leave you with a smile, the kind of thoughts that will leave you feeling safe and secure. Everything is all right right now, everything is fine, not a worry, no problems, no dangers. Okay, I'm not going to get a stomachache, I'm going to be okay. These would be wholesome thoughts. Now there's a whole great big group of thoughts in the middle that we could have that are considered thoughts about the past, thoughts about the future, thoughts about other places. Like, oh, it's snowing in Seattle. Well, whether it's snowing in Seattle or not is not going to make me joyful, right? Those would be ordinary thoughts, but the ordinary thoughts also hinder us from being in a really good state. So any kind of thoughts about someplace else Not right here, some other time, sometime in the past, sometimes in the future. Now here's one thing that's kind of interesting, and that is, is that the past is vast. There is so much past, there's so much past we don't even know how much there is. And the future is vast. There's so much of it, we don't know how much there is of the future. And the present moment is small, except for one thing, and that is always happening. The past is not yet to be. Another way of looking at it, the past— I mean, the future is yet to be. The future actually doesn't even exist. The past is gone, it's dead, it's buried, and most of it is forgotten. And so the past is really not as vast as we thought. But this present moment is all we've got, and we keep having it over and over and over again. It's always right now. Interesting, which means that the reality is, is that right now is vast, and the past and the future are very small. The other idea then would be here versus there, because we think that there is vast— the whole planet Earth, Mars, galaxies— things are really, really vast, except you can't go there. Yet wherever you go When you arrive, you're here. And so other places, theirs, are not so big after all. In fact, they really don't exist. Even though you could say, well, Chicago exists right now, and the people in Chicago are having a here right in Chicago, people in Delhi are here in Delhi, okay, except that that's not part of your existence. They're ideas, they're thoughts, possibly unwholesome thoughts, thoughts of curiosity: "I wonder what the weather is in Chicago." Guess what? That's irrelevant. To whether you feel good or not. But if you can come and say, right here is paradise, right here is quite marvelous, right here is safe. You're in your room, you probably got the door closed, and you are safe.

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** And so that's the real existence. And it's vast because wherever you are, it's here. Here is always here, and there often doesn't even exist except in our imagination. So if the thoughts are of there, and if the thoughts are of the past or the future, we're actually in ordinary kind of thinking. That is also a kind of a hindrance because it's hindering us from being in our paradise right here, right now.

**Speaker A:** Can I ask a question?

**Speaker B:** Absolutely, go right ahead.

**Speaker A:** I guess like I understand that— sorry, like we do need ordinary thinking sometimes for sure to like live our lives and to do our jobs and to be in school?

**Speaker B:** Well, probably we need a few, which leaves in a vast amount of time to be here and now. And yet we spend way too much time thinking about the past and the future. They're interconnected in several ways. Almost always when we're thinking about the future is based upon something in the past. For instance, I've got to go do something. Well, the something that I've got to go do arose in the past, and in that immediate present of that past event, I didn't take care of it. I haven't taken care of it yet. And so you can see the plan that we make to take care of it is actually the connection between the past and the future, without recognizing that in between is right here, right now. Let's enjoy that. Okay, so here would be an example of it, is that, oh, we've got, we've got a check and we've got to go cash it at the bank. All right, going into the bank Sitting down at the teller's desk or standing at the aisle and signing the check and getting the cash, that's a present moment, here now kind of thing that happens. But before we go to the bank, how many thoughts do we have about going to the bank?

**Speaker A:** A lot.

**Speaker B:** A lot, right? And none of them were of much value because we were thinking about going to the bank and we didn't go to the bank.

**Speaker A:** Yep.

**Speaker B:** All right, so now that you can see that most of those ordinary thoughts that just happen over and over and over and over again, and while we're having them, we're actually build up a sense of urgency, a sense of anxiety, a sense of I've got to go get it done and I'm still not doing it. And so we wind up with some residual amount of ongoing anxiety because we keep having thoughts about, I've got to go do this, I've got to go do that. And so this is why we want to start practicing on a really often regular basis to repeat and repeat and repeat, to keep coming back to the here now and having wholesome thoughts. Rather than thoughts of things that I need to do but I haven't done yet, like go to the bank and go to the bank and go to the bank. In other words, take the pressure off yourself, take the heat off of yourself. Don't have anxiety about going to the bank. When you go to the bank, you'll go to the bank. But when you're not going to the bank, why need to think about going to the bank? We've already got that done. Why, why think about the bank 100 times and go once? Why not go to the bank and think about the bank when you're going to the bank, and when you're not going to the bank, think about having fun and being happy and joyful? Oh, I'm so glad I don't have to go to the bank right now. So, a lot of it then has to do with finding the correct balance. You've probably heard of the phrase, the Goldilocks place. The place is someplace in the middle, a place that's comfortable and happy. And yet, we live in a society of extremes. Even political parties who call themselves in the middle, still, it's an extreme form of the middle. That in fact, if you were really in the middle place about politics, you wouldn't care at all about what happens. Because whatever those people over there are doing, they find misery and discomfort and anger and frustrations. And all the people over on that extreme, they find anger and frustrations and ways to blame people, etc., like that. And so they wind up blaming each other. So it's better not to be in the middle. Instead of being, for instance, an independent, you know, you got the Dems and you got the Rebs and then you've got the independents. The better way to do it is to be out of it. I'm not independent, I'm not a Democrat, I'm not a Reb, I'm nothing. And then I don't have any troubles with those folks. Whatever they do is okay with me. I'll take care of only the business that I need to take care of, and everything else is hunky-dory. And so I can come back and have happy thoughts about all those Dems— never mind— all those Rebs— never mind. All those independents stuck in the middle going back and forth. Oh, never mind. So this winds up meaning that we can see that a lot of the thoughts that we used to have that we can consider were okay kinds of thoughts, they wind up in fact getting in the way of being in a really good place. And so this is why we need to remember to keep practicing, because as you continue to practice and practice and practice and practice being here now, being joyful, being happy, being safe, secure, comfortable, and satisfied, that builds up It builds up to a fourth item. And that item in the Pali is called Samma Sanghappa. And it's also associated with the Pali word Saddha or Shraddha. And what that word means is confidence. And you begin to have the confidence that no matter what George Bush does, I'm okay. No matter what Putin does, I'm okay. Whatever Biden does, I'm okay. Whatever Trump does, I'm okay. I'm all right. Let them go do what they're going to do, and I'm still okay. So this is the way that we start to begin to think over and over and over again. I'm okay. I'm all right. I'm satisfied. When we gain that, then we begin to have confidence that I can sustain that position of being safe and secure, comfortable and satisfied. No matter what comes up, I can handle it. Or as it says in the sutras, no matter how obstructed the mind becomes, I can come out of it. Now that's something very strange for the beginners, because the beginners who are practicing, they have the idea of, oh, I can get out of it, but I get stuck right back in. Oh, I can get out of it, but I get stuck right back in. And so they put the weight of the preponderance of, oh, I get stuck right back in, which is an unwholesome So we need to practice focusing on, "Yeah, but I can get out of it. Yeah, but I can get out of it. Yeah, I can get out of that stuff. Yeah, I'm stronger than my own mind. I can change my mind." And that gains us that confidence that no matter what happens, I can handle it. Slowly, slowly, what we're really doing is we're changing our attitude. From the victim's position of, "Yeah, but it keeps coming back again," or, "Yeah, but it's hard," or, "Yeah, but it's unwholesome," "Yeah, but I'm stuck, I've got habits of the unwholesome," "Yeah, I get frustrated," "Yeah, I get sad." But once we start to say, "I can get out of that stuff, I can get out of it, I can change my mind," I can live a wholesome life, then that victimhood begins to shift into a winner's position, a top dog position, a boss's position, or as it were, an emperor's position. There's an old story that says is that everyone is an emperor of their own personal pile of dirt. Which is basically our own pile of crap, which is basically our past, right? Now, are you going to be buried as the emperor? Are you going to be buried under your kingdom? Are you going to be buried under your pile of dirt? Are you going to be buried under your ton of shit? Or are you going to crawl your way out of it and creep your way out of it and claw your way out of it? Which is the way that most people practice meditation. But there's another way of doing it, and that is just simply, I'm on top of it. I'm on top of this. I'm sitting on top of my own world. I'm the boss here. I am not struggling to get out of my pile of dirt. It's just down there. And so you begin to change your attitude to becoming the winner, to becoming the emperor who's on top of the world. In fact, there's a Pali word called lokottara, and the lokottara means basically above the world, on top of the world. You're not buried under it, you're not the underdog. Now you're the top dog, and that's an attitude change. And so that you can incorporate into also your wholesome kind of thoughts. Well, I can handle this criticism. Yeah, I can handle criticism. When people criticize me years ago, oh, poor me. Oh, I've been criticized. Oh, I've been wounded. Oh, they say that about me. If everybody knew that about me, everybody would hate me. Right? And even if I know about it now, even I hate me. So that's the normal way that we live. That's the way that we're taught. That's the way that everybody around us lives their life. And by an example, they have been teaching you to be a victim. Everybody is a victim. We are born as a victim. The question is, can you come out of your victimhood And children, they don't have the skills, but you're now developing the skills to come out of your victimhood. And as you do, you can see more and more these thoughts are in fact unwholesome, and you can begin to change them into wholesome thoughts. And then one of the wholesome thoughts you can have is, wow, I really like this state of being wholesome. Well, I really like it. I can do it. This is my style now. I can change my style, and my style is the style of a winner. But it has to be practiced over and over again, because you've got that old style that keeps coming back. Can you see it when it comes back so that you can say, out of here, I got a new style? Yeah.

**Speaker A:** So during the practice then, or at least what I'm taking away, is that the majority of our thoughts are, even if we think that they're like okay thoughts, are actually just hindrances. So we should just keep thinking wholesome thoughts, even if we think our thoughts are okay.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, especially if you catch yourself having that same thought twice. Then you can say, hey, I don't need to see that anymore. I've seen it once, I got the lesson. You've heard this expression that there is no education in the second kick of a mule.

**Speaker A:** I actually haven't heard that, but that makes sense.

**Speaker B:** All right, there's another expression that they have, and that is, fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. And here we go around shaming ourselves by having foolish thoughts without seeing that we've been fooled. I have heard that. We've been lied to. Yeah, we have been lied to. What is the lie? Unwholesome thoughts are generally lies. Like, this is how I sit here. No, it's not. It's paradise. You're telling a lie. The reality is, is that the room that you're in is beautiful. It's a paradise.

**Speaker A:** If I have like thoughts that keep recurring about like people or situations, do you have any specific antidotes for that other than just thinking wholesome thoughts?

**Speaker B:** Well, I can't think of one. And the question is, is that can you? It's not a matter of let's find an alternate. Then in fact, we could say then that there's 3 ways to handle any situation. The first way to handle it when we're beginners is to get out of the situation, change the situation itself. If you're in an argument, you can say, oh, I got to go to the toilet, I'm out of here. If you're on a conversation, an argument on the phone, you can say, oh, I've got to go take care of something, I'll call you back. All right, if you're in an argument with your wife, you know, many arguments with husbands and wives wind up with one of them slamming the door on the way out. Can you leave the situation before it's door slamming time, going out? Can you check out easily? Can you go away easily? All right, that's the first step. The middle one in the middle is when you have enough skill to go away mentally without actually physically having to go away. And a way of saying that is that when people are criticizing you, can you keep your mouth shut? When somebody is arguing with you, can you have the presence of mind to not argue back? Be quiet. And then the third one, which is the top, that's the real skill, is when you can give them what they want happily and make them happy too. It's okay. Yeah, you're right. Yeah, I agree with you, no problem. You want me to do something? Sure, I'll get right on it. I'll do a really good job for you. Okay, so again, the first way to handle any tough situation is to get away from it. For instance, you're on Reddit and somebody criticizes you. The right thing to do is just turn the computer off, go to some other website. Go do something else, get away from it, don't go back. The second way to do it is to read it but not respond. And then you'll read something else, don't respond to that. Then you'll read another one, don't respond to that. Be able to be quiet. Okay, but in real situations, the better thing to do is to have joy, have a smile. They can't touch you. There's a song, I don't know who wrote it, but it's a popular song nowadays. It goes something like, 'Nananana, you can't touch me.' And that the reality is that they can't, because who they're attacking is their idea of you, their opinion of you, and you are certainly not what they sum it up to be. That's not the sum total of you. They may pick on one little thing, so what? I'm vaster than that, I'm bigger than that, I'm a moving target. There is no such thing as a me that is so small that it can be attacked. And here, oh, I'm being 'Oh, this is me. Oh, this is terrible,' is only an attitude of a victim. But if you have the attitude, 'Oh, they can't touch you,' whatever they're saying goes right by you. You begin to duck these mental bullets, these verbal arrows. Like, uh, have you ever heard of or seen the movie The Matrix? Yeah, yeah, that's the whole point of it. They can't shoot you, they can't touch you. You can play dodgeball easily. That's the ultimate skill, is that they can't touch you, they can't hit you. So this is the way of practicing. When you catch yourself criticizing yourself, when you're having critical thoughts of yourself, you can say, "Ah, I'm going to have nurturing thoughts instead." Instead of trying to wound myself in order to improve, the real improvement is that, "Oh, I can be okay. I can nurture." Everything's all right, everything is fine, everything's going to be okay, not a problem, not a worry in the world. And so we keep coming back to the wholesome kind of thoughts, but we have to practice. That's why you're here, that's why you should be calling me on a regular basis, is to hear this so that it'll help you to remember to start practicing. Yeah. Remember, start changing the thoughts that you're having and change them into something that's more wholesome, more life-giving, more life-affirming, so that life becomes a joy. And why not enjoy? I mean, if life is short and we cling to it anyway— in fact, we cling so hard that they call it an instinct, self-preservation instinct. So we really cling to life But if we really want it so badly, why don't we enjoy it when we have it?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Why do we think that a complaint or a criticism is actually life-robbing? It doesn't rob us of life. We rob ourselves of life. And how do we rob ourselves? By robbing ourselves of having wholesome thoughts and substituting crap substituting unwholesome thoughts instead. So this is the way to practice over and over and over again. Everything's okay, everything is fine. Wow, what a beautiful moment this is. So can you start to do that over and over again?

**Speaker A:** Yeah.

**Speaker B:** Yeah, come out of your Dukkha. Be joyful.

**Speaker A:** This morning, that makes sense.

**Speaker B:** Excellent. All right, well, call me again in a few days and we'll continue on. There's— I'm sure that we've covered new stuff today for you, and every day there'll be some new stuff to do, but mostly it's the same thing, practicing wholesomeness over and over again.

**Speaker A:** Okay.

**Speaker B:** All right.

**Speaker A:** Just to make sure I'm getting this right, so when I sit down for the 10 minutes, or even just throughout my general life, I just take some nice deep breaths and think wholesome thoughts, observe my thoughts, my mind, my body, and just keep thinking wholesome things. Okay, that makes sense.

**Speaker B:** Great. All right, well, we'll see you.

**Speaker A:** Thank you so much. I really appreciate you talking to me.

**Speaker B:** All right, Abdul, we'll see you, baby.


### Summary

This Dhamma talk, led by Dhammarato (Speaker B) with a student (Speaker A), is a practical guide to transforming the mind through the intentional cultivation of wholesome thoughts. Here is a summary of the key teachings:

### **Core Practice: Cultivating Wholesome Thoughts**
The central instruction is to repeatedly and intentionally generate wholesome thoughts during meditation (even in short 10-minute sits) and throughout daily life. The goal is to replace unwholesome or "hindering" thoughts that create suffering with thoughts that generate joy, peace, and safety.

### **Key Distinctions: Wholesome vs. Unwholesome Thoughts**
*   **Downright Unwholesome (Hindrances):** These are clear obstacles to well-being. Examples include thoughts of **revenge, anger, guilt, sorrow, anxiety, hurry, and remorse**. Dhammarato uses the poignant example of his puppy's death to illustrate how cultural conditioning teaches us to feel sorrow and guilt, while a more wholesome approach is to celebrate the puppy's life and feel joy, recognizing that sadness doesn't help the deceased.
*   **Downright Wholesome:** Thoughts that lead to feelings of **safety, security, satisfaction, and joy**. Examples: "Everything is okay right now," "I am safe," "Let me appreciate this moment."
*   **The Vast Middle "Ordinary" Thoughts:** This is the 90% of thinking that often goes unexamined. These are thoughts about the **past, future, or other places** (e.g., "What's the weather in Chicago?"). While they seem neutral, they are *hindrances* because they pull you away from the "paradise" of the present moment—the only reality you can actually experience.

### **Philosophical Underpinnings: The Primacy of "Here and Now"**
Dhammarato deconstructs our mental obsession with the past and future:
*   The **past is gone**; the **future doesn't exist yet**. Only the **present moment ("here and now") is vast and continuously available**.
*   Thinking about tasks (e.g., going to the bank) creates anxiety and urgency. The skillful approach is to think about the task only when doing it, and to be fully present and joyful when you are not.
*   Applying this to broader issues (like politics) means moving from identification and reactivity ("I'm a Democrat/Republican") to a detached, peaceful state ("I'm nothing related to that; I'm okay regardless").

### **Developing Confidence and Shifting Identity**
*   Through persistent practice, you build **confidence (Saddha/Shraddha)** in your ability to return to a wholesome state "no matter what happens."
*   This catalyzes a fundamental **attitude shift**: from being a **victim** of your thoughts and external events ("I'm stuck in my habits") to being the **"emperor" or "top dog"** (lokottara—above the world). You move from being buried under your "pile of dirt" (past conditioning) to sitting joyfully on top of it.

### **Practical Antidotes for Recurring Thoughts**
When faced with criticism, conflict, or recurring negative thoughts:
1.  **Beginner:** Physically remove yourself from the situation (end the call, leave the room).
2.  **Intermediate:** Stay present but **don't engage or argue back**. Practice mental non-response.
3.  **Advanced:** **Respond with joyful agreement and kindness**. See attacks as aimed at a false, small idea of "you." Cultivate the attitude, "You can't touch me," like dodging bullets in *The Matrix*. The ultimate skill is to nurture yourself with wholesome thoughts instead of self-criticism.

### **Final Takeaway and Instruction**
The practice is simple but requires constant repetition to overcome deep-seated habits:
1.  **Observe** your thoughts.
2.  **Categorize** them as wholesome or unwholesome/hindering.
3.  **Gently but firmly replace** unwholesome thoughts with wholesome ones.
4.  **Repeat** endlessly, building a new identity as someone who chooses joy and peace in the present moment.

The talk concludes by reinforcing that this practice is not just for formal sitting but is a way of life: "Why don't we enjoy [life] when we have it?" By choosing wholesome thoughts, we stop robbing ourselves of joy.

### Metaphors and Stories

Based on the transcript, the speaker uses several **metaphors** and **stories** to illustrate the core teaching of shifting from unwholesome to wholesome thoughts.

### Key Metaphors:
1.  **The Pile of Dirt / Kingdom:** The mind's accumulation of past habits and unwholesome thoughts is compared to a "pile of dirt" or a "ton of shit." The practitioner is described as the "emperor" of this pile. The key choice is whether you are **buried under it** (a victim) or **sitting on top of it** (the boss/winner).
2.  **Mental Bullets / Verbal Arrows:** Hurtful criticism and negative thoughts are likened to projectiles that can be dodged. This connects to the next metaphor.
3.  **The Matrix / Dodgeball:** The ultimate skill in handling negativity is portrayed as being like Neo in *The Matrix*, dodging bullets, or playing a mental game of dodgeball where attacks "can't touch you."
4.  **Goldilocks Place:** The ideal balanced mental state is referred to as the "Goldilocks place"—not too extreme, just right, comfortable, and happy.
5.  **Hindrances:** Unwholesome thoughts are repeatedly called "hindrances," metaphorically framing them as obstacles blocking the path to joy and peace.
6.  **The Vastness of Here vs. There:** The speaker uses a spatial metaphor to contrast the imagined, distracting vastness of "there" (other places), the past, and the future with the true, ever-present vastness of "here and now," which is the only real place of existence and peace.

### Key Stories and Anecdotes:
1.  **The Story of the Puppy:** This is the central, extended story. The speaker uses the death of his own puppy to vividly illustrate:
    *   **Unwholesome Thoughts:** Guilt ("What could I have done?"), sorrow, societal conditioning ("I'm so sorry"), and even revenge ("I'll report that vet!").
    *   **Wholesome Thoughts:** Celebrating the puppy's life, wishing it farewell peacefully, choosing joy in the present moment. It serves as a powerful, personal example of how we have a choice in our emotional response.
2.  **The Bank Example:** A simple, relatable story about the anxiety and repetitive, unnecessary thinking ("I've got to go to the bank") we generate about future tasks, contrasting it with the peace of being present when you're *not* doing the task.
3.  **The Political Example:** A story about extremes (Democrats, Republicans, Independents) to illustrate how attachment to any political identity creates frustration. The "wholesome" stance is presented as being completely "out of it," thereby attaining peace.
4.  **The Mule & The Fool:** Two proverbial stories are referenced:
    *   **"No education in the second kick of a mule":** Once you've learned a painful lesson (recognized an unwholesome thought pattern), there's no value in experiencing it again.
    *   **"Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me":** Recurring negative thoughts are like fooling yourself repeatedly. Recognizing them as "lies" (e.g., "this room isn't paradise") helps you stop the cycle.
5.  **The Three Ways to Handle Conflict:** A structured anecdote outlining a progression of skill:
    *   **Beginner:** Physically remove yourself from a bad situation (leave the argument).
    *   **Intermediate:** Stay physically but disengage mentally (keep your mouth shut).
    *   **Advanced:** Engage with joy and agreement, defusing the situation entirely ("You're right, no problem").

### Overall Narrative Metaphor:
The entire talk is framed as a journey from **victimhood** to **empowerment**, from being the **underdog** buried by habits to becoming the **top dog** or **emperor** in command of one's own mind. The practice is the path of climbing out of the "pile" of conditioned thinking and sitting triumphantly on top of it.
